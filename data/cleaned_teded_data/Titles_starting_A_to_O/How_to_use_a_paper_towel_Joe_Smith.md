571 million two hundred thirty thousand
pounds of paper towels are used by
Americans every year if we could
correction wrong figure 13 billion used
every year if we could reduce the usage
of paper towels one paper towel per
person per day 571 million two hundred
thirty thousand pounds of paper not used
we could do that now there are all kinds
of paper towel dispensers
there&#39;s the trifold people typically
take two or three there&#39;s the one that
cuts it that you have to tear off people
go one two three four tear this much
right there&#39;s the one that cuts itself
people go one two three four or there&#39;s
the same thing but recycle paper you
have to get five of those because
they&#39;re not as absorbent of course the
fact is you can do it all with one towel
the key to words this half of the room
your word is shake let&#39;s hear it shake
louder
your word is fold again really loud okay
wet hands shake one two three four five
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
why twelve twelve apostles twelve tribes
twelve zodiac signs twelve months one I
like the best it&#39;s the biggest number
with one syllable
trifle fold dry cuts itself fold the
fold is important because it allows
interstitial suspension you don&#39;t have
to remember that part for trusted cuts
itself you know if anything is I get my
hands dryer that people do with three or
four because they can&#39;t get in between
the cracks if you think this isn&#39;t as
good now there&#39;s no real fancy invention
it&#39;s the one where you wave your hand
and it kicks it out it&#39;s way too big a
towel let me tell you a secret if you&#39;re
really quick if you&#39;re really quick and
I can prove this this is half a towel
from the dispenser in this building how
as soon as it starts just tear it off
and it&#39;s smart enough to stop and you
get half a towel
now let&#39;s all say it together shake fall
you will for the rest of your life
remember those words every time you pick
up a paper towel and remember one talent
per person for one year 571 million two
hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper
no small thing and next year toilet
paper
