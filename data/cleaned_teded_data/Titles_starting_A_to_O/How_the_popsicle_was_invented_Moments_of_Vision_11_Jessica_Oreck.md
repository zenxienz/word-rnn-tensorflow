In a Moment of Vision...
It&#39;s 1905, Northern California.
Frank Epperson is eleven years old.
He&#39;s sitting on his front porch
making a sort of DIY drink
that&#39;s very popular at this time.
He has just poured a sugary soda powder
into a glass of water
and is mixing enthusiastically
with a wooden stir stick.
We don&#39;t know exactly how the next
24 hours play out,
but we can imagine that something
catches Frank&#39;s attention
and he abandons his drink mid-stir.
After a cold Bay Area night,
Frank rediscovers his mix drink
the next morning.
It&#39;s frozen solid.
But instead of throwing it out,
Frank pulls the icy block of soda out
of the glass by the embedded stir stick
and, in a moment of vision, licks it.
Delighted by his invention,
Frank begins making the frozen treat
for friends,
and as he grows older,
begins selling them as Eppsicles,
a contraction of his last name
and the word icicle.
It is rumored that later,
Frank&#39;s own kids dubbed the icy
delicacy Pop&#39;s &#39;cicle.
Others claim the name is a combination
of lollipop and icicle.
Regardless where the name comes from,
the popsicle is here to stay.
Approximately 2 billion popsicles
are sold each year.
