I collaborate the bacteria and I&#39;m about
to show you some stop-motion footage
that I made recently where you&#39;ll see
bacteria accumulating minerals from
their environment over a period of an
hour so what you&#39;re seeing here is the
bacteria metabolizing and as they do so
they create electrical charge and this
attracts metals from their local
environment and these metals accumulate
as minerals on the surface of the
bacteria one of the most pervasive
problems in the world today for people
is inadequate access to clean drinking
water and the desalination process is
one where we take out salts we can use
it for drinking and agriculture
well removing the salts from water in
particularly seawater through reverse
osmosis is a critical technique for
countries who do not have access to
clean drinking water around the globe so
sea water reverse osmosis is a membrane
filtration technology and we take the
water from the sea and we apply a
pressure and this pressure forces the
seawater through a membrane this takes
energy producing clean water but we&#39;re
also left with a concentrated salt
solution or brine
but the process is very expensive and
its cost prohibitive for many countries
around the globe
and also the brine that&#39;s produced is
oftentimes just pumped back out into the
sea and this is detrimental to the local
ecology of the sea area if that it&#39;s
pumped back out into so I work in
Singapore at the moment and this is a
place that&#39;s really a leading place for
desalination technology and Singapore
proposes by 2060 to produce 9 million
liters per day of desalinated water but
this will produce an equally massive
amount of desalination brine and this is
where my collaboration with bacteria
comes into play so what we&#39;re doing at
the moment is we&#39;re accumulating metals
like calcium potassium and magnesium
from out of desalination brine and this
in terms of magnesium and the amounts of
water that I just mentioned equates to a
four point five u.s. billion dollar
mining industry for Singapore a place
that doesn&#39;t have any natural resources
so I like it
imagine a mining industry in a way that
one hasn&#39;t existed before imagine a
mining industry that doesn&#39;t mean
defiling the earth and imagine bacteria
helping us do this by accumulating and
precipitating and sedimenting minerals
out of desalination brine and what you
can see here is the beginning of an
industry and a test tube a mining
industry that is in harmony with nature
thank you
