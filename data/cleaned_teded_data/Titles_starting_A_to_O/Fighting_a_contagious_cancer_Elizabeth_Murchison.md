everyone&#39;s familiar with cancer but we
don&#39;t normally think of cancer as being
a contagious disease the Tasmanian devil
has shown us that not only can cancer be
a contagious disease but it can also
threaten an entire species with
extinction so first of all water is a
Tasmanian devil many of you might be
familiar with Taz the cartoon character
the one that spins around and around and
around but not many people know that
there actually is a real animal called
the Tasmanian devil and it&#39;s the world&#39;s
largest carnivorous marsupial and
marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like
a kangaroo the Tasmanian Devil got its
name from the terrifying nocturnal
scream that it makes the Tasmanian devil
is predominantly a scavenger and it uses
its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to
chomp on the bones of rotting dead
animals Tasmanian devil is found only on
the island of Tasmania which is that
small island just to the south of the
mainland of Australia and despite their
ferocious appearance Tasmanian devils
are actually quite adorable little
animals in fact growing up in Tasmania
always was incredibly exciting when we
got a chance to see that Tasmanian Devil
in the wild but the Tasmanian devil
population has been undergoing a really
extremely fast decline and in fact
there&#39;s concern that the species could
go extinct in the wild within 20 to 30
years and the reason for that is the
emergence of a new disease a contagious
cancer the story begins in 1996 when a
wildlife photographer took this
photograph here of it has manian devil
with a large tumor on its face at the
time this is thought to
be a one-off animals just like humans
sometimes get strange tumors however we
now believe that this is the first
sighting of a new disease which is now
an epidemic spreading through Tasmania
the disease was first sighted in the
northeast of Tasmania in 1996 and has
spread across Tasmania like a huge wave
now there&#39;s only a small part of the
population which remains unaffected this
disease appears first as tumors usually
on the face or inside the mouth of
effective Tasmanian devils these tumors
never simply grow into larger tumors
such as these ones here and the next
image I&#39;m going to show is quite
gruesome but inevitably these tumors
progress towards being enormous
ulcerating tumors like this one here
this one in particular sticks in my mind
because this is the first case of this
disease that I saw myself and I remember
the horror of seeing this little female
devil with this huge ulcerating
foul-smelling tumor inside her mouth
that it actually cracked off her entire
lower jaw she hadn&#39;t eaten for days her
guts were swimming with parasitic worms
her body was riddled with secondary
tumors and yet she was still feeding
through little baby Tasmanian devils in
her pouch of course they died along with
a mother they too young to survive
without their mother in fact in the area
where she comes from more than ninety
percent of the Tasmanian Devil
population has already died of this
disease scientists around the world were
intrigued by this cancer this infectious
cancer that were spreading through the
Tasmanian devil population and our minds
immediately turns to cervical cancer in
women which is spread by a virus and to
the AIDS epidemic which is associated
with a number of different types of
cancer all the evidence suggested that
this devil cancer was spread by a virus
however we now know and i&#39;ll tell you
right now that we know that this cancer
is not spread by a virus in fact the
infectious agent of
even this cancer is something altogether
more sinister and something that we
hadn&#39;t really thought of before but in
order for me to explain what that is I
need to spend just a couple of minutes
talking more about cancer itself cancer
is a disease that affects millions of
people around the world every year one
in three people in this room will
develop cancer at some stage in their
lives I myself had a tumor removed from
my large intestine when I was only 14
cancer occurs when a single cell in your
body acquires a set of random mutations
in important genes that cause that cell
to start to produce more and more and
more and more copies of itself
paradoxically once established natural
selection actually favors the continued
growth of cancer natural selection is
survival of the fittest and when you
have a population of fast dividing
cancer cells if one of them requires new
mutations which allow them to grow more
quickly acquire nutrients more
successfully invade the body they&#39;ll be
selected for by evolution that&#39;s why
cancer is such a difficult disease to
treat it evolves throw a drug edit and
resistance cells will grow back an
amazing factors that given the right
environment and the right nutrients a
cancer cell has the potential to go on
growing forever however cancer is
constrained by living inside our bodies
and its continued growth is spreading
through our bodies are eating away at
our tissues leads to the death of the
cancer patient and also to the death of
the cancer itself so cancer can be
thought of as a strange short-lived
self-destructive life form an
evolutionary dead end but that is where
the Tasmanian Devil cancer has acquired
an absolutely amazing evolutionary
adaptation and the answer came from
studying the Tasmanian devil cancers DNA
this has worked for many people but I&#39;m
going to explain it through an
momentary experiment that I did a few
years ago next slide is going to be
gruesome this is Jonas he&#39;s a Tasmanian
devil that we found with a large tumor
on his face and being a geneticist I&#39;m
always interested to look at DNA and
mutations so I took this opportunity to
collect some samples from Genesis tumor
and also some samples from other parts
of his body I took these back to the lab
i extracted DNA from them and when I
looked at the sequence of the DNA and
compared the sequence of Jonas&#39;s tumor
to that of the rest of his body I
discovered that they had a completely
different genetic profile in fact Jonas
and his tumor or as different from each
other as you and the person sitting next
to you what this told us was that
Jonas&#39;s tumor did not arise from cells
of his own body in fact more genetic
profiling told us that this tumor in
Jonas actually probably first arose from
the cells of a female Tasmanian devil
and Jonas is clearly a male so how come
a tumor that that arose from the cells
of another individual are growing on
Jonas&#39;s face well the next breakthrough
came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian
Devil cancers from all around tasmania
we found that all of these cancers
shared the same DNA think about that for
a minute that means that all of these
cancers actually are the same cancer
that arose once from one individual
devil that are broken free of that first
Devils body and spread through the
entire Tasmanian devil population but
how can I cancer spread in a population
well the final piece of the puzzle came
when we remembered how Devils behave
when they meet each other in the wild
they tend to bite each other often quite
ferociously and usually on the face we
think that cancer cells actually come
off the tumor get into the saliva when
the devil bites another devil that
actually physically implants living
cancer cells into the next devil so the
jima continues to grow this tez minion
devil cancer is perhaps the ultimate
cancer
it&#39;s not constrained by living within
the body that gave rise to it it spreads
through the population has mutations
that allow it to evade the immune system
and it&#39;s the only cancel that we know of
that&#39;s threatening an entire species
with extinction but if this can happen
in Tasmanian Devils why hasn&#39;t it
happened in other animals or even humans
well the answer is it has this is kimbo
he&#39;s a dog that belongs to a family in
Mombasa in Kenya last year his owner
noticed some blood trickling from his
genital region she took him to the vet
and the vet discovered something quite
disgusting and if you&#39;re squeamish
please look away now he discovered this
a huge bleeding tumor at the base of
Kimber&#39;s penis the vet diagnosed this as
transmissible venereal tumor a sexually
transmitted cancer that affects dogs and
just as the Tasmanian devil cancers
contagious through the spread of living
cancer cells so is this dog cancer but
this dog cancer is quite remarkable
because it spread all around the world
and in fact these same cells that are
affecting Kimbo here are also found
affecting dogs in New York City in
mountain villages in the Himalayas in
outback Australia we also believe this
cancer might be very old in fact genetic
profiling tells that it may be tens of
thousands of years old which means that
this cancer may have first arisen from
the cells of a wolf that lived alongside
than the and atolls this cancer is
remarkable it&#39;s the oldest mammalian
derived life-form that we know of it&#39;s a
living relic of the distant past so
we&#39;ve seen that this can happen in
animals crude cancers be contagious
between people well this is a question
which fascinated Chester Southern a
cancer doctor in the 1950s and he
decided to put this to the test by
actually deliberately inoculating people
with cancer from somebody else and this
is a photograph of dr. southern in 1957
injecting cancer into a volunteer who in
this case was an inmate in Ohio State
Penitentiary most of the people that dr.
serve them injected did not go on to
develop cancer from the injected cells
but a small number of them did and they
were mostly people who were otherwise
ill whose immune systems were probably
compromised what this tells us ethically
shoes aside is that it&#39;s probably
extremely rare for cancers to be
transferred between people however under
some circumstances it can happen and I
think that this is something that
oncologists and epidemiologists should
be aware of in the future so just
finally cancer is an inevitable outcome
of the ability of our cells to divide
and to adapt to their environments but
that does not mean that we should give
up hope in the fight against cancer in
fact I believe given more knowledge of
the complex evolutionary processes that
drive cancers growth we can defeat
cancer my personal name is to defeat the
Tasmanian Devil cancer let&#39;s prevent the
Tasmanian devil from being the first
animal to go extinct from cancer thank
you
