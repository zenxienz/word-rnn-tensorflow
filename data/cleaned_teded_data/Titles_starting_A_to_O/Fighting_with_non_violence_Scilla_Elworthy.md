in half a century of trying to help
prevent Wars there&#39;s one question that
never leaves me how do we deal with
extreme violence without using force in
return when you&#39;re faced with brutality
whether it&#39;s a child facing a bully in
the playground or domestic violence or
on the streets of Syria today facing
tanks and shrapnel what&#39;s the most
effective thing to do fight back given
use more force this question how do I
deal with the bully without becoming a
thug in return has been with me ever
since I was a child I remember because I
was about 13 glued to a grainy
black-and-white television in my parents
living room as Soviet tanks rolled into
Budapest and kids not much older than me
we&#39;re throwing themselves at the tanks
and getting mown down and I rushed
upstairs and started packing my suitcase
and my mother came up and said what on
earth you doing and I said I&#39;m going to
Budapest and she said what on earth for
and I said kids are getting killed there
there&#39;s something terrible happening and
she said don&#39;t be so silly and I started
to cry and she got it she said okay I
see it serious you&#39;re much too young to
help you need training I&#39;ll help you but
just unpack your suitcase
and so I got some training and went and
worked in Africa during most of my 20s
but I realized that what I really needed
to know I couldn&#39;t get from training
courses I wanted to understand how
violence our oppression works and what
I&#39;ve discovered since is this bullies
used violence in three ways they use
political violence to intimidate
physical violence to terrorize and
mental or emotional violence to
undermine and only very rarely in very
few cases does it work to use more
violence Nelson Mandela went to jail
believing in violence on 27 years later
he and his colleagues had slowly and
carefully honed the skills the
incredible skills that they needed to
turn one of the most vicious
government&#39;s the world is known into a
democracy and they did it in a total
devotion to non-violence they realized
that using force against force doesn&#39;t
work so what does work overtime I&#39;ve
collected about a half-dozen methods
that do cause them any more that do work
and that are effective and the first is
that the change that has to take place
has to take place here inside me it&#39;s my
response my attitude to oppression that
I&#39;ve got control over that I can do
something about and what I need to
develop is self-knowledge to do that
that means I need to know how I tick
when I collapse where my formidable
points are
where my weaker points are when do I
give in what will I stand up for and
meditation or self inspection is one of
the ways of getting not the only one one
of the ways of gaining this kind of
inner power and my heroin here like
satish&#39;s is on San suchi in Burma she
was leading the group of students on a
protest in the streets of Rangoon they
came around a corner faced with a row of
machine guns and she realized straight
away that the soldiers with their
fingers shaking on the triggers were
more scared than the student protesters
behind her but she told the students to
sit down and she walked forward with
such calm and such clarity and such
total lack of fear that she could walk
right up to the first gun put her hand
on it and lower it and no one got killed
so that&#39;s what the mastery of fear can
do not only faced with machine guns but
if you if you meet a knife fight in the
street that we have to practice so what
about our fear I have a little mantra my
fear grows fat on the energy I feed it
and if it grows very big it probably
happens so we all know the three o&#39;clock
in the morning syndrome when something
you&#39;ve been worrying about wakes you up
I see a lot of people and for an hour
you toss and turn it gets worse and
worse and by four o&#39;clock you&#39;re pinned
to the pillow by a monster this big the
only thing to do is to get up make a cup
of
he and sit down with the fear like a
child beside you you&#39;re the adult the
fear is the child and you talk to the
fear and you ask it what it wants what
it needs how can this be made better how
can the child feel stronger and you make
a plan and you say okay now we&#39;re going
back to sleep half past seven we&#39;re
getting up and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going
to do I had one of these three a.m.
episodes on Sunday paralyzed with fear
are coming to talk to you so I got it I
did the thing I got up made the cup of
tea sat down with it digital and I&#39;m
here still parley paralyzed but I&#39;m here
I said that&#39;s fear what about anger
wherever there&#39;s injustice there&#39;s anger
but anger is like gasoline and if you
spray it around and somebody lights a
match you&#39;ve got an inferno but anger as
an engine in an engine is powerful if we
can put our anger inside an engine it
can drive us forward it can get us
through the dreadful moments and it can
give us real inner power and I learned
this in my work with nuclear weapon
policymakers because at the beginning I
was so outraged at the dangers they were
exposing us to that I just wanted to
argue and blame and make them wrong
totally ineffective in order to develop
a dialogue for change we have to deal
with our anger it&#39;s okay to be angry
with the the thing the nuclear weapons
in this case but it is hopeless to me
angry with the people they are human
beings just like us and they&#39;re doing
what they think is best and that&#39;s the
basis on which we have to talk with them
so that&#39;s the third one
anger and it brings me to the crux of
what&#39;s going on or what am I perceive is
going on in the world today which is
that last century was
