so I have a strange career I know it
because people come up to me like
colleagues and say Chris even strange
career and I can see that point because
you know I started my career as a
theoretical nuclear physicist and I was
thinking about quarks and gluons and
heavy iron collisions and I was only 14
years old no no no no I wasn&#39;t 14 years
old but after that I actually had my own
lab in a computational neuroscience
Department and I wasn&#39;t doing any
neuroscience later I would work on
evolutionary genetics and we&#39;ve got
systems biology but I&#39;m gonna tell you
about something else today I&#39;m gonna
tell you about how I learned something
about life and I was actually a rocket
scientist I was a rocket something I
wasn&#39;t really a rocket scientist but I
was working at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in sunny California where
it&#39;s warm whereas now I&#39;m in the Midwest
and it&#39;s cold but it was an exciting
experience one day a NASA manager comes
into my office sits down and says can
you please tell us how do we look for
life outside earth and that came as a
surprise to me because I was actually
hired to work on quantum computation yet
I had a very good answer i said i have
no idea and he told me bio signatures we
need to look for a bio signature and i
said what is that and he said it&#39;s any
measurable phenomenon that allows us to
indicate the presence of life and I said
really because it&#39;s not easy I mean way
of life can&#39;t you apply like a different
mission like for example a Supreme Court
like definition of life and then start
about in a little bit and I said well is
it really that easy because yes if you
see something like this then all right
fine i&#39;m going to call it a life no
doubt about it but here&#39;s something it
goes like right that&#39;s life too i know
that except if you think
that life is also defined by things that
died you&#39;re not in luck with this thing
because that&#39;s actually very strange
organism it grows up into its adult
stage like that and then goes through
like a Benjamin Button phase and
actually goes backwards and backwards
until it&#39;s sucked a little embryo again
and then actually grows back up and back
down and back up sort of yo yo and it
never dies so it&#39;s actually life but
it&#39;s actually not as we thought life
would be and then you see something like
that and it was like my god what kind of
a life form is that anyone know it&#39;s
actually not life it&#39;s a crystal so once
you start looking and looking at smaller
and smaller things so this particular
person wrote a whole article and said
hey these are bacteria except if you
look a little bit closer he&#39;s see in
fact that this thing is way too small to
be anything like that so he was
convinced but in fact most people aren&#39;t
and then of course NASA also had a big
announcement in fact President Clinton
gave a press conference about this
amazing discovery of life and a Martian
meteorite except that nowadays it&#39;s
heavily disputed if you take the lesson
of all these pictures then you realize
well actually maybe it&#39;s not that easy
maybe I do need a definition of life in
order to make that kind of distinction
so can life be defined well how would
you do about it or of course you go to
bridge no Encyclopedia Britannica and
open at l no of course you don&#39;t do that
you put it somewhere in Google and then
you might get something and what you
might get and you got anything that
actually refers to you know things that
we are used to you throw away and then
you can might come up with something
like this and it says something
complicated with lots and lots of
concepts who on earth would write
something as convoluted and complex and
nein oh it&#39;s actually you know a really
really important set of concepts so I&#39;m
highlighting just a few words and saying
definitions like that rely on things
that are not based on amino acids or
leaves or anything that we are used to
but in fact on processes only and if you
take a look at that this was actually in
a book that I wrote that these was
artificial life and that explains why
that NASA manager was actually in my
office to begin with because the idea
was that was concepts like that maybe we
can actually manufacture a form of life
and so if you go in ask yourself what on
earth is artificial life let me of your
like a whirlwind to of how all this
stuff came about and it&#39;s done it out
quite a while ago when someone wrote one
of the first successful computer viruses
and for those of you who aren&#39;t all
enough you have no idea how this
infection was working namely through
these floppy disks but the interesting
thing about these computer virus
infections was that if you look at the
rate at which these infection work they
show like the spiky behavior that you&#39;re
used to like from flu virus and it is in
fact due to this arms race between
hackers and operating system designers
that things go back and forth and the
results is kind of a tree of life of
these viruses a phylogeny that looks
very much like the type of life that we
used to at least on the viral level so
is that life not as far as I&#39;m concerned
why because these things don&#39;t evolve by
themselves in fact they have hackers
writing them but the idea was taken very
quickly a little bit further when a
scientist working at the Santa Fe
Institute decided why don&#39;t we try to
package these little viruses in
artificial worlds inside of the computer
and let them evolve and this was stay in
Rasmussen and he designed the system but
it didn&#39;t really work because these
viruses were constantly destroying each
other but there was another scientist
they had been watching this an ecologist
and he went home and says I know how to
fix this and he wrote the chera system
and in my book is in fact one of the
truly artificial living systems except
for the fact that these programs didn&#39;t
really grow in complexity so having seen
this work worked a little bit on us this
is where I came in and I decided to
create a system that has all the
properties that are necessary to see in
fact the evolution of complexity more
and more complex programs constantly
evolving and of course since I really
don&#39;t know how to write code I&#39;ll help
in this I two undergraduate students at
california institute of technology that
worked with me that&#39;s Charles are free
on the left titus brown on the right
they are now actually respectable
professors at michigan state university
but i can assure you back in the days
you know we were not a respectable team
and I&#39;m really happy that no photo
survives of the three of us anywhere
close together but what is the system
like well I can&#39;t really go into the
details but what you see here is some of
the entrails for the word I want you to
focus on is this type of population
structures about 10,000 programs sitting
here and all different strains are
colored in different colors and as you
see here there are groups that are
growing on top of each other because
they&#39;re spreading anytime there&#39;s a
program that&#39;s better it&#39;s surviving in
this world due to whatever mutation that
is acquired it&#39;s going to spread over
the others and drive the others to
extinction so I&#39;m going to show you a
movie where you&#39;re going to see that
kind of dynamics and this movie star I
mean these kind of experiments are
started with programs that we you wrote
ourselves we write our own self
replicator are now very proud of
ourselves and we put them in and what
you see immediately is that there are
waves and waves of innovation by the way
this is highly accelerated so it&#39;s like
a thousand generations a second but
immediately the system goes like what
kind of dumb piece of code was this this
can be improved upon in so many ways so
quickly so you see waves of new types
taking over the other types and this
type of activity goes on for quite a
while until the main easy things have
been acquired by these programs and then
you see sort of like a stasis coming on
where the system essentially ways for a
new type of innovation like
one which is going to spread over all
the innovations that were before and is
raising the genes that it had before
until the new type of higher level of
complexity has been achieved and this
process goes on and on and on so what we
see here is a system that lives in very
much the way that we&#39;re used to life
goes but what the NASA people had asked
me really was do these guys have a bio
signature can we measure this type of
life because if we can maybe we have a
chance of actually discovering life
somewhere else without being biased by
things like amino acids so I said well
perhaps we should construct a bio
signature based on life as a universal
process in fact it should perhaps make
use of the concepts that I developed
just in order to sort of capture what
this simple living system might be and
the thing I came up with I have to first
give you sort of a introduction about
the idea and namely that would be a
meaning detector rather than a life
detector and the way we would do that
it&#39;s like ok I would like to find out
how I can distinguish text that was
written by a million monkeys as opposed
to texts that are in our books and I
would like to do in such a way that I
don&#39;t actually have to be able to read
the language because you know I&#39;m sure I
won&#39;t be able to as long as I know that
there&#39;s some sort of alphabet so here
would be a frequency plot of how often
you find each of the 26 letters of the
alphabet in a text written by random
monkeys and obviously each of these
letters comes off about roughly equally
frequent but if you now look at the same
distribution in English text it looks
like that and I&#39;m telling you this is
very robust across English text and if i
look at french text it looks a little
bit different or I tell you know German
they all have their own type of
frequency distribution but its robust it
doesn&#39;t matter whether it writes about
politics or about science it doesn&#39;t
matter whether it&#39;s a poem or whether it
is in a mathematical texts it&#39;s a robust
signature and it&#39;s very stable as long
as our books are written
English because people are rewriting
them re-- copying them it&#39;s going to be
there so that inspired me to think about
well what if I try to use this idea in
order not to detect random text from
text with meaning but rather detect the
fact that there is meaning in the bio
molecules that make up life but first I
have to ask what are these building
blocks like the alphabet elements that I
showed you well it turns out we have
many different alternatives for such a
set of building blocks we could use the
amino acids we could use nucleic acid
covered selig acid fatty acids and fat
chemistry is extremely rich and our body
uses a lot of them so that we actually
to test this idea first take took a look
at amino acids and some other carboxylic
acids and here&#39;s the result here is in
fact what you get if you for example
look at the distribution of amino acids
on a comet or in interstellar space or
in fact in a laboratory where you made
very sure that in your primordial soup
that there is no living stuff in there
what you find is mostly lysine and then
alanine and that&#39;s a trace element of
the other ones okay that is also very
robust what you find in systems like
earth where there are amino acids but
there is no life but suppose you take a
you know some dirt and dig through it
and then put it into these spectrometers
because there&#39;s bacteria all over the
place or you take water anywhere on
earth because it&#39;s teeming with life and
you make the same analysis the spectrum
looks completely different of course
there&#39;s still glycine and alanine but in
fact there are these heavy elements is
heavy amino acids that are being
produced because they are valuable to
the organism and some other ones that
are not used in that set of 20 there
will not appear at all at any type of
concentrations so this also turns out to
be extremely robust it doesn&#39;t matter
what kind of sediment you&#39;re using to
grind up whether it&#39;s bacteria or any
other you know plants or animals
anywhere there&#39;s a life you&#39;re going to
have this distribution as opposed to
that distribution and it is detectable
not just in the amino acids now you
could ask well what about
these variants the avidians being the
denizens of this computer world where
they are perfectly happy replicating and
growing in complexity so this is the
distribution that you get if in fact
there is no life they have about twenty
eight of these instructions and if you
have a system where they&#39;re being
replaced one by the other it&#39;s like the
monkeys riding on a typewriter each of
these instructions appears was roughly
the equal frequency but if you now take
us take a set of replicating guys like
in the video that you saw it looks like
this so are there are some instructions
that are extremely valuable to these
organisms and their frequency is going
to be high and there&#39;s actually some
instructions that Yuri only want to use
once if ever so they either poisonous or
really you know should be used at less
of a level than random and in this case
the frequency is lower and so now we can
see is that really a robust signature I
can tell you indeed it is because this
type of spectrum just like what you&#39;ve
seen in books and just like what you&#39;ve
seen in the new assets it doesn&#39;t really
matter how you change the environment
it&#39;s very robust it&#39;s going to reflect
the environment so i&#39;m going to show you
now a little experiment that we did and
i have to explain to you the top of this
graph shows you that frequency
distribution that i talked about ok here
in fact that&#39;s the lifeless environment
where each instruction occurs at an
equal frequency and below there i show
in fact the mutation rate in the
environment and i&#39;m starting this anna
mutation rate that is so high that even
if you would drop a replicating program
that would otherwise happily grow up to
fill the entire world if you drop it in
it gets mutated less immediately ok so
there is no life possible at that type
of mutation rate but then I sinister
slowly turn down the heat so to speak
and then there is this viability
threshold where now it would be possible
for a replicator to actually live and
indeed we&#39;re going to be dropping these
guys into that soup all the time so
let&#39;s see how what that looks like so
first nothing nothing nothing too hot
too hot
now the viability threshold is reached
and the frequency distribution has
dramatically changed and in fact
stabilized now I what I did there is i
just i was being nasty i just turned up
the heat again again and of course it
reaches the viability threshold and i&#39;m
just showing this to again because it&#39;s
so nice you hit the viability threshold
the distribution changes to alive and
then once you hit the threshold where
the mutation rate is so high that you
cannot sell for produce you cannot copy
the information forward to your
offspring without making so many
mistakes that your ability to replicate
vanishes and then that signature is lost
what do we learn from that well I think
we learn a number of things from that
one of them is if we are able to think
about life in abstract terms and we&#39;re
not talking about things like plants we
are talking about amino acids and we&#39;re
not talking about bacteria but we think
in terms of processes then we could
start to think about life not as
something that is so special to earth
but that in fact could exist anywhere
because it really only has to do with
these concepts of information of storing
information within physical substrates
anything bits nucleic acids anything
that&#39;s an alphabet and make sure that
there&#39;s some process so that this
information can be stored for much
longer than you would expect you know
the time scales for the deterioration
you know of information and if you can
do that then you have life so the first
thing that we learn is that it is
possible to define life in terms of
processes alone without referring at all
to the type of things that you know we
hold dear as far as the type of life on
earth is and that in a sense removes us
again like all of our scientific
discoveries or many of them it leads to
a continuous dethroning of man of like
how I think we&#39;re special because we are
live well we can make life we can make
live in the computer granted it&#39;s
limited but we have
learned what it takes in order to
actually construct it and once we have
that then it is not such a difficult
task anymore to say if we understand the
fundamental processes that do not refer
to any particular substrate then we can
go out and try other worlds figure out
what kind of chemical alphabets might
there be figure enough about the normal
chemistry the geochemistry of the planet
so that we know what this distribution
would look like in the absence of life
and then look like two large deviations
from this this thing sticking out with
says this chemical really shouldn&#39;t be
there now we don&#39;t know that there is
life then but we could say well at least
I&#39;m going to have to take a look very
precisely at this chemical and see way
of you know where it comes from and that
might be our chance of actually
discovering life when we cannot visibly
see it and so that&#39;s really the only
take home message that I have for you
life can be less mysterious that we make
it out to be when we try to think about
how it would be on other planets and if
we remove the mystery of life then I
think it is a little bit easier for us
to think about how we live and how
perhaps we&#39;re not as special as we
always think we are and I&#39;m going to
leave you with that and thank you very
much
you
