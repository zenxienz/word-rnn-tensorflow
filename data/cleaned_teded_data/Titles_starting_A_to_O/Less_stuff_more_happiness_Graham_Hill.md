what&#39;s in the box whatever it is must be
pretty important because I&#39;ve traveled
with it moved it from apartment to
apartment to apartment sound familiar
did you know that we Americans have
about three times the amount of space we
did 50 years ago three times so you
think with all this extra space we&#39;d
have plenty of room for all our stuff
right nope there&#39;s new industry in town
a twenty two billion dollar 2.2 billion
square foot industry that a personal
storage so we&#39;ve got triple the space so
we become such good shoppers that we
need even more space so where does this
lead lots of credit card debt huge
environmental footprints and perhaps not
coincidentally our happiness levels
flatline over the same 50 years well I&#39;m
here to suggest there&#39;s a better way
that less might actually equal more I
bet most of us have experienced at some
point the joys of less college your dorm
traveling in hotel room camping we got
basically nothing maybe a boat whatever
it was for you I bet that among other
things this gave you a little more
freedom a little more time so I want to
suggest that less stuff and less space
are going to equal smaller footprint
it&#39;s actually a great way to save you
some money and it&#39;s gonna give you a
little more ease in your life so I
started a project called life edited at
life edit org to further this
conversation and to find some great
solutions in this area
first up crowdsourcing my 420 square
foot apartment in Manhattan with
partners mu topo and Joe Vodacom I
wanted it all home office sit-down
dinner for 10
room for guests and all my kite surfing
gear with over 300 entries from around
the world I got it my own little jewel
box by buying a space that was 420
square feet instead of 600 immediately
I&#39;m saving 200 grand smaller space is
going to make for smaller utilities save
some more money there but also a smaller
footprint and because it&#39;s really
designed around an edited set of
possessions my favorite stuff and really
designed for me
I&#39;m really excited to be there so how
can you live little three main
approaches first of all you to edit
ruthlessly we&#39;ve got to clear the
arteries of our lives that shirt that I
haven&#39;t wore in years it&#39;s time for me
to let it go we&#39;ve got to cut the
extraneous out of our lives and we&#39;ve
got to learn to stem the inflow we need
to think before we buy ask ourselves is
that really gonna make me happier truly
by all means we should buy and own some
great stuff but we want stuff that we&#39;re
going to love for years not just stuff
secondly our new mantra small is sexy we
want space efficiency we want things
that are designed for how their you use
the vast majority of the time not that
rare event why have a six-burner stove
when you rarely use three so we want
things that nest we want things that
stack and we want to digitize you can
take paperwork looks movies and you can
make it disappear it&#39;s magic finally we
want multifunctional spaces and
housewares a sinks combined of the
toilet a dining table becomes a bed same
space a little side table stretches out
to see ten in the winning life edited
scheme and a render here we combine a
moving wall with transformer furniture
to get a lot out of the space look at
the coffee table
it grows in height and width to see 10
my office folds away easily hidden my
bed just pops out of the wall two
fingers guests
move the moving wall have some fold-down
guest beds and of course my own movie
theater so I&#39;m not saying that we all
need to live in 420 square feet but
consider the benefits of an edited life
go from three thousand to two thousand
from fifteen hundred to a thousand most
of us maybe all of us are here pretty
happily for a bunch of days with couple
bags maybe small space hotel room so
when you go home and you walk through
your front door take a second and ask
yourselves could I do with a little life
editing would that give me a little more
freedom maybe a little more time what&#39;s
in the box it doesn&#39;t really matter I
know I don&#39;t need it
what&#39;s in yours maybe just maybe less
might equal more so let&#39;s make room for
the good stuff thank you
you
