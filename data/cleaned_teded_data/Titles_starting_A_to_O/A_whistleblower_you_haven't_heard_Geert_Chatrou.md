thank you
thank you very much that was whistling
and I&#39;m trying to do this in English
what does a chubby girl you have a guy
from Holland is why is he whistling well
actually I&#39;m listening since the age of
four about four my dad was always
messing around the house and I just
thought that&#39;s part of communication in
my family so I whistled along with him
and well actually till I was 34
I always annoyed and irritated people
with whistling because to be honest my
whistling is a kind of deviant behavior
I was along I whistled in the classroom
I whistled on bike I whistled everywhere
and I also whistled at a Christmas Eve
party with my family in law they had
some in my opinion terrible Christmas
music and when I hear music that I don&#39;t
like I try to make it better so when
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer you know
it but it can also sound like this
but during a Christmas party at dinner
actually it&#39;s very annoying so my
sister-in-law asked me a few times
please stop whistling and I just
couldn&#39;t and at one point and I had some
wine I have to admit that at one point I
said if there was a contest I will join
and two weeks later I received a text
message you&#39;re going to America
so okay I&#39;m going to America I would
love to but why so I immediately called
her up of course she googled and she
found this world with whistling
championship in America of course she
didn&#39;t expect me to go there and well I
would have lost my face I don&#39;t know if
that&#39;s correct English but the Dutch
people here well understand that I mean
um I lost my face and she thought she
thought he will never go there but
actually I did so I went to lose Burke
North Carolina southeast of America the
United States and I entered the world of
whistling and I also entered the world
championship and I wonder in 2004 so
that was that was great fun of course
and to defend my title like you dokas do
and then sports man I thought well let&#39;s
go back in 2005 and I won again then I
couldn&#39;t participate for a few years and
in 2008 after the game in Japan Tokyo
and I won again so what what happened
now is I&#39;m standing here in Rotterdam in
the beautiful city on a big stage and
I&#39;m talking about whistling and actually
I earn my money whistling at the moment
so I quit my day job as a nurse
and I try to live my dream what actually
was never my dream but it sounds so good
okay I&#39;m not the only one whistling here
you say huh what do you mean well
actually you are going to whistle alone
and then always the same thing happens
people are watching each other I think
oh my god why but can I go right now you
can&#39;t actually it&#39;s very simple the song
the track that I will whistle is called
fatty LaBelle it&#39;s about 18 minutes long
no no no no it&#39;s four minutes long and I
want to first rehearse with you you&#39;re
whistling yes so I whistled it down
sorry I forgot one thing
and you whistle the same tone as me so
yeah I a wide variety of variety of
tones this is very promising this is
very promising I act ask the technicians
to start the music and if it&#39;s started I
just point you where you whistle along
and we will see what happens oh I&#39;m so
sorry
technicians
I&#39;m so used that I started myself okay
here it is
I propose I do that myself okay
