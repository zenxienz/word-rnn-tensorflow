there are a lot of ways the people
around us can help improve our lives we
don&#39;t bump into every neighbor so a lot
of wisdom never gets passed on but we do
share the same public spaces so over the
past few years I&#39;ve tried ways to share
more with my neighbors in public space
using simple tools like stickers
stencils and chalk and these projects
came from questions I had like how much
are my neighbor is paying for their
apartments how can we lend and borrow
more things without knocking on each
other&#39;s doors at a bad time how can we
share more of our memories of our
abandoned buildings and gain a better
understanding of our landscape and how
can we share more of our hopes for our
vacant storefronts so our communities
can reflect our needs and dreams today I
live in New Orleans and I am in love
with New Orleans my soul is always
soothed by the giant live oak trees
shading lovers drunks and dreamers for
hundreds of years and I trust a city
that always makes way for music I feel
like every time someone sneezes New
Orleans other parade the city has some
of the most beautiful architecture in
the world but it also has were the
highest amounts of abandoned properties
in America I live near this house and I
thought about how I could make it a
nicer space for my neighborhood and I
also thought about something that
changed my life forever in 2009 I lost
someone I loved very much her name was
Joan and she was a mother to me and her
death was sudden and unexpected and I
thought about death a lot
and this made me feel deep gratitude for
the time I&#39;ve had and brought clarity to
the things that are meaningful to my
life now but I struggle to maintain this
perspective in my daily life I feel like
it&#39;s easy to get caught up in the
day-to-day and forget what really
matters to you so with help from older
new friends i turn the side of this
abandoned house into a giant chalkboard
and stenciled it with the fill in the
blank sentence before I die I want to so
anyone walking by can pick up a piece of
chalk reflect on their lives and share
their personal aspirations in public
space I didn&#39;t know what to expect from
this experiment but by the next day the
wall was entirely filled out and it kept
growing and I&#39;d like to share a few
things that people wrote on this wall
before I die I want to be tried for
piracy
before I die I want to straddle the
international date line before I die I
want to sing for millions before I die I
want to plant a tree before I die I want
to live off the grid before I die I want
to hold her one more time before I die I
want to be someone&#39;s cavalry before I
die I want to be completely myself so
this neglected space became a
constructive one and people&#39;s hopes and
dreams made me laugh out loud cheer up
and they consoled me during my own tough
times it&#39;s about knowing you&#39;re not
alone it&#39;s about understanding our
neighbors and noonan lightning ways it&#39;s
about making space for reflection and
contemplation and remembering what
really matters most to us as we grow and
change I made this last year and started
receiving hundreds of messages from
passionate people who wanted to make a
wall with their community so my civic
center colleagues and I made a toolkit
and now all&#39;s have been made in
countries around the world including
Kazakhstan South Africa Australia
Argentina and beyond together we&#39;ve
shown how powerful or public spaces can
be if we&#39;re given the opportunity to
have a voice and share more with one
another to the most valuable things we
have our time and our relationships with
other people in our age of increasing
distractions it&#39;s more important than
ever to find ways to maintain
perspective and remember that life is
brief and tender death is something that
we&#39;re often discouraged to talk about or
even think about but I&#39;ve realized that
preparing for death is one of the most
empowering things you can do
thinking about death clarifies your life
our shared spaces can better reflect
what matters to us as individuals and as
a community with more ways to share our
hopes fears and stories the people
around us can not only help us make
better places they can help us lead
better lives thank you
you
