the thousand-year-old drawing of the
brain it&#39;s a diagram of the visual
system and some things look very
familiar today it&#39;s two eyes at the
bottom optic nerve flowing out from the
back it is a very large nose that
doesn&#39;t seem to be connected to anything
in particular and if we compare this to
more recent representations of the
visual system you&#39;ll see that things
have gotten substantially more
complicated over the intervening
thousand years and that&#39;s because today
we can see what&#39;s inside of the brain
rather than just looking at its overall
shape imagine you wanted to understand
how a computer works and all you could
see was a keyboard a mouse a screen you
really would be kind of out of luck you
you want to be able to open it up crack
it open look at the wiring inside and up
until a little more than a century ago
nobody was able to do that with the
brain nobody had had a glimpse at the
brains wiring and that&#39;s because if you
take a brain out of the skull and you
cut a thin slice of it put it under even
a very powerful microscope there&#39;s
nothing there it&#39;s gray formless there&#39;s
no structure it won&#39;t tell you anything
and this all changed in the late 19th
century suddenly new chemical stains her
brain tissue were developed and they
gave us our first glimpses at brain
wiring the computer was cracked open so
what really launched modern neuroscience
was a stain called the Golgi stain and
they works in a very particular way
instead of staining all of the cells
inside of a tissue it somehow only
stains about 1% of them it clears the
forest reveals the trees inside if
everything had been labeled nothing
would have been visible so somehow it
shows what&#39;s their Spanish
neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon nikka hall
who&#39;s widely considered the father of
modern neuroscience applied this Golgi
stain which yields data that looks like
this and and really gave us the modern
notion of the nerve cell the neuron and
if you&#39;re thinking of the brain as a
computer this is the transistor and very
quickly Cahal realized that neurons
don&#39;t operate alone but rather make
connections with others that form
circuits just like in a computer today a
century later when researchers want to
visualize neurons
they light them up from the inside
rather than darkening them and there are
several ways of doing this but one of
the most popular ones involves green
fluorescent protein now green
fluorescent protein which oddly enough
comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish is
very useful because if you can get the
gene for green fluorescent protein and
deliver it to a cell that cell will glow
green or any of the many variants now of
green fluorescent protein you get a cell
to glow many different colors and so
coming up back to the brain this is from
a genetically engineered mouse called
brain Bo and its so-called of course
because all of these neurons are glowing
different colors now sometimes neuro
scientists need to identify individual
molecular components of neurons
molecules rather than the entire cell
and there are several ways of doing this
but one of the most popular ones
involves using antibodies and you&#39;re
familiar of course with antibodies as
the henchmen of the immune system but it
turns out that they&#39;re so useful to the
immune system because they can recognize
specific molecules like for example the
coat protein of a virus that&#39;s invading
the body and researchers have used this
fact in order to recognize specific
molecules inside of the brain recognize
specific substructures of the cell and
identify them individually and you know
a lot of the images I&#39;ve been showing
you here are very beautiful but they&#39;re
also very powerful they have great
explanatory power this for example is an
antibody staining against serotonin
transporters in a slice of mouse brain
and you&#39;ve heard of serotonin of course
in the context of diseases like
depression and anxiety you&#39;ve heard of
SSRIs which are drugs that are used to
treat these diseases and in order to
understand how serotonin works it&#39;s
critical to understand where the
serotonin machinery is and antibody
staining is like this one can be used to
understand that sort of question I&#39;d
like to leave you with the following
thought green fluorescent protein and
antibodies are both totally natural
products at the get-go they were evolved
by nature in order to get a jellyfish to
glow green for whatever reason or in
order to detect the coat protein of an
invading virus for example and only much
later did scientists come onto the scene
and say hey these are tools these are
functions that we could use in our
research tool palette and instead of
applying feeble human minds to designing
these tools from scratch there were
these ready-made solutions right out
there in nature developed and refined
steadily for millions of years by the
greatest engineer at all thank you
