there&#39;s a large path of destruction here
in town it here pulling trees from the
ground shattering windows taking the
roofs off that was me in front of our
house in months in Massachusetts last
June after an ef3 tornado ripped
straight through our town and took parts
of our roof off I decided to stay in
Massachusetts instead of pursuing the
master&#39;s program I had moved my boxes
home that afternoon for so on june first
we weren&#39;t disaster experts but on jun
3rd we started faking it this experience
changed our lives and now we&#39;re trying
to change the experience so tornados
don&#39;t happen in Massachusetts and I was
cleverly standing in the front yard when
one came over the hill after a lamp post
flew by my family and I sprinted into
the basement trees were thrown against
the house the windows exploded when we
finally got out the back door
transformers were burning in the street
so I was here in Boston I&#39;m a PhD
student at MIT and I happened to study
atmospheric science actually it gets
weirder so I was in the Museum of
Science at the time the tornado hit
playing with the tornado display so I
missed her call so I get the call from
Kate Rhea I hear the news and I start
tracking the radar online to call the
family back when another supercell was
forming in their area and I drove home
late that night with batteries and ice
we live across the street from an
historic church that had lost its very
iconic steeple in the storm it had
become a community gathering place
overnight the Town Hall and the police
department had also suffered direct hits
and so people wanting to help or needing
information went to the church we walked
up to the church because we heard that
they had hot meals but when we arrived
we found problems there were a couple
large sweaty men with chainsaws standing
in the center of the church but nobody
knew where to send them because no one
knew the extent of the damage yet and as
we watched they became frustrated and
left to go find somebody to help on
their own so we started organizing why
it had to be done we found Pastor Bob
and offered to give the response of
infrastructure and then armed with just
two laptops and one aircard we built a
recovery machine
that was a tornado and everyone&#39;s
heading to the church to drop things off
and volunteer everyone&#39;s donating
clothing we should really inventory the
donations that are piling up here yeah
and we need a hotline can you make a
google voice number yeah sure and we
need to tell people what not to bring
i&#39;ll make a facebook account can you
print flyers for the neighborhood&#39;s yeah
but we don&#39;t even know what houses are
accepting help at this point we need to
canvass and send out volunteers we need
to tell people what not to bring hey
there&#39;s a news truck I&#39;ll tell them you
got my number off the news we don&#39;t need
anymore freezers and city insurance
don&#39;t remember it you guys gonna turn to
rumor someone get me posted and then the
rest of the community figured out that
we had answers I can donate three water
heaters but someone needs to come pick
them up my car is in my living room my
Boy Scout Troop would like to rebuild 12
mailboxes the puppies missing and
insurance just doesn&#39;t cover the
chimneys my church group of 50 would
like housing and meals for a week while
we repair properties you sent me to that
place on washington street yesterday and
now i&#39;m covered in poison ivy so this is
what filled our days we had to learn how
to answer questions quickly and to solve
problems in about a minute or less
because otherwise something more urgent
would come up and it just wouldn&#39;t get
done we didn&#39;t get our authority from
the Board of Selectmen or the emergency
management director or the united way we
just started answering questions and
making decisions because someone anyone
had to and why not me I&#39;m a campaign
organizer I&#39;m good at Facebook and
there&#39;s two of me
the point is if there&#39;s a flood or a
fire or a hurricane you or somebody like
you are going to step up and start
organizing things the other point is
that it is hard lying on the ground
after another 17 hour day k tree and I
would empty our pockets and try to place
dozens of scraps of paper into context
all bits of information that had to be
remembered and matched in order to help
someone after another day and a shower
at the shelter we realized it shouldn&#39;t
be this hard in a country like ours
where we breathe Wi-Fi leveraging
technology for a faster recovery should
be a no-brainer systems like the ones
that we were creating on the fly could
exist ahead of time and if some
community member is in this organizing
position in every area after every
disaster these tools should exist so we
decided to build them a recovery in a
box something that could be deployed
after every disaster by any local
organizer I decided to stay in the
country give up the Masters in Moscow
and to work full time to make this
happen in the course of the past year
we&#39;ve become experts in the field of
community power disaster recovery and
there are three main problems that we&#39;ve
observed with the way things work
currently the tools large aid
organizations are exceptional at
bringing massive resources to bear after
a disaster but they often fulfill very
specific missions and then they leave
this leaves local residents to deal with
the thousands of spontaneous volunteers
thousands of donations and all with no
training and no tools so they use
post-its or Excel or facebook but none
of these tools allow you to value
high-priority information amidst all of
the photos and well wishes the timing
disaster relief is essentially a
backwards political campaign in a
political campaign you start with no
interest and no capacity to turn that
into action you build both gradually
until a moment of peak mobilization at
the time of the election in a disaster
however you start with all of the
interest and none of the capacity and
you&#39;ve only got about seven days to
capture fifty percent of all of the web
searches that will ever be made to help
your area then some sporting event
happens and you&#39;ve got only the
resources that you&#39;ve collected thus far
to meet the next five years of recovery
needs this is the slide for Katrina this
is the curve for joplin and the
the curve for the dallas tornadoes in
April where we deployed software there&#39;s
a gap here affected households have to
wait for the insurance adjuster to visit
before they can start accepting help on
their properties and you&#39;ve only got
about four days of interest in Dallas
data data is inherently unsexy but it
can jump-start an area&#39;s recovery FEMA
in the state will pay eighty five
percent of the cost of a federally
declared disaster leaving the town to
pay the last fifteen percent of the bill
now that expense can be huge but if the
town can mobilize X amount of volunteers
for y hours the dollar value of that
labor used goes toward the town&#39;s
contribution but who knows that now try
to imagine the sinking feeling you get
when you&#39;ve just sent out 2,000
volunteers and you can&#39;t prove it these
are three problems with a common
solution if we can get the right tools
at the right time to the people who will
inevitably step up and start putting
their communities back together we can
create new standards in disaster
recovery we needed canvassing tools
donations databasing needs reporting
remote volunteer access all in an
easy-to-use website and we needed help
Alvin our software engineer and
co-founder has built these tools Chris
and Bill have volunteered their time to
use in operations and partnerships and
we&#39;ve been flying into disaster areas
since this past January setting up
software training residents and
licensing the software to areas that are
preparing for disasters one of our first
launches was after the dallas tornadoes
this past april we flew into a town that
had a static outdated website in a
frenetic facebook feed trying to
structure the response and we launched
our platform all of the interest came in
the first four days but by the time they
lost the news cycle that&#39;s when the
needs came in yet they had this massive
resource of what people are able to give
and they&#39;ve been able to meet the needs
of the residents so it&#39;s working but it
could be better emergency preparedness
is a big deal in disaster recovery
because it makes town safer and more
resilient imagine if we could have these
systems ready to go in a place before a
disaster so that&#39;s what we&#39;re working on
we&#39;re working on getting the software to
places so people expect it so people
know how to use it and so it can be
filled ahead of time with that micro
information that drives recovery it&#39;s
not rock
science these tools are obvious and
people want them in our hometown we
trained a half dozen residents to run
these web tools on their own because K
tree and I live here in boston they took
to it immediately and now there are
forces of nature there are over three
volunteer groups working almost every
day and have been since june first of
last year to make sure that these
residents get what they need and get
back in their homes they have hotlines
and spreadsheets and data and that makes
a difference June first this year marked
the one-year anniversary of the Munson
tornado and our communities never been
more connected or more empowered we&#39;ve
been able to see the same transformation
in Texas and an Alabama because it
doesn&#39;t take Harvard or MIT to fly in
and fix problems after a disaster it
takes a local no matter how good an aid
organization is at what they do they
eventually have to go home but if you
give locals the tools if you show them
what they can do to recover they become
experts
