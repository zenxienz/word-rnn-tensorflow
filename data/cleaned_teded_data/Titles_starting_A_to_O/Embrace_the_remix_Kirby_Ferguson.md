we&#39;re going to begin in 1964 Bob Dylan
is 23 years old and his career is just
reaching its pinnacle he&#39;s been
christened the voice of a generation and
he&#39;s churning out classic songs at a
seemingly impossible rate but there&#39;s a
small minority of dissenters and they
claim Bob Dylan is stealing other
people&#39;s songs 2004 ryan burton AK
danger mouse takes the Beatles White
Album combines it with JC is the black
album to create the grey out the gray on
becomes an immediate sensation online
and the Beatles record company sends out
countless cease and desist letters for
unfair competition and dilution of our
valuable property now the grey album is
a remix it is new media created from old
media it was made using these three
techniques copy transform and combine
that&#39;s how your remix you take existing
songs you chop them up you transform the
pieces you combine them back together
again you&#39;ve got a new song but that new
song is clearly comprised of old songs
but i think these aren&#39;t just the
components re mixing i think these are
the basic elements of all creativity I
think everything is a remix and I think
this is a better way to conceive of
creativity alright let&#39;s head back to
nineteen sixty-four and let&#39;s hear where
some of dylan&#39;s early songs came from
you can do some side by side comparisons
here alright this first song you&#39;re
going to hear is not him in town it&#39;s
your traditional folk tune after that
you&#39;ll hear at Dylan&#39;s masters of war
and not a man down mata sold the car not
a solid look
but now I&#39;m your masters is war if it
fell the big guns if it Bella des
plaines hit below the bombs so that&#39;s
the same basic melody and overall
structure this next one is the patriot
game by Dominic bein alongside Dan
you&#39;re gonna hear with God on our side
by Dylan young rebels and lyst while I
sing for love of one&#39;s mind is a
terrible thing oh my knee he did nothing
my age it means less the country i come
from his collar midwest ok so in this
case still limits he must have heard the
patron he forgot about it then when song
kind of bubbled back up in his brain he
just thought it was his song last one
this is who&#39;s gonna buy your rivets
another traditional folk tune alongside
that is don&#39;t think twice it&#39;s alright
this one&#39;s more about the lyric
siddons i na Daan and it ain&#39;t no use to
sit and cry
how did he know you sit in 105 bit even
you don&#39;t know by now and you know you
send one of I have it he&#39;ll never do
somehow okay now there&#39;s a lot of these
it&#39;s been estimated that two-thirds of
the melodies Dylan used in his early
songs were borrowed this is pretty
typical among folk singers here&#39;s the
advice of Dylan&#39;s Idol Woody Guthrie the
words are the important thing don&#39;t
worry about tunes take a tune sing high
when they sing lo Hsing fast when they
sing slow you&#39;ve got a new tune and
that&#39;s that&#39;s what Guthrie did right
here and I&#39;m sure you all recognize the
results
come soon right we know it actually you
don&#39;t that is when the world&#39;s on fire
very old melody in this case performed
by the Carter Family Guthrie adapted it
into this land is your lamp so Bob Dylan
like all folk singers he copied melodies
he transformed them he combined them
with new lyrics which were frequently
their own concoction of previous stuff
now American copyright and patent laws
run counter to this notion that we build
on the work of others instead these laws
and laws around the world use the rather
awkward analogy of property now if
creative works may indeed be kind of
like property but its property that
we&#39;re all building on and creations can
only take root and grow once that
grounds been prepared Henry Ford once
said I invented nothing new I simply
assembled the discoveries of other men
behind whom were centuries of work
progress happens when all the factors
that make for it already and then it is
inevitable 2007 the iphone makes its
debut Apple undoubtedly brings this
innovation to us early but it&#39;s time was
approaching because its core technology
had been evolving for decades that&#39;s
multi-touch controlling a device by
touching its display here is Steve Jobs
introducing multi-touch and making a
rather foreboding joke and we have
invented a new technology called
multi-touch you can do multi finger
gestures on it and boy have we patented
it yes and yet here is multi-touch in
action this is that Ted actually about a
year earlier this is jeff hahn and I
mean that&#39;s multi-touch it&#39;s the same
animal at least let&#39;s hear what jeff
hahn has to say about this newfangled
technology multi touch sensing isn&#39;t
anything isn&#39;t completely new I mean
people I feel boxing have been playing
around with in the 80s the technology
you know isn&#39;t isn&#39;t the most exciting
thing here right now other than probably
its newfound accessibility so he&#39;s
pretty frank about it not being you so
it&#39;s not multi-touch as a whole that&#39;s
patented it&#39;s the small parts of it that
are and it&#39;s in these small details
where we can clearly see patent law
contradicting its intent to promote the
progress of useful
it&#39;s here is the first ever slide to
unlock that is all there is to it Apple
has patented this it&#39;s a 28-page
software patent but I will summarize
what it covers spoiler alert unlocking
your phone by sliding an icon with your
finger I&#39;m I&#39;m only exaggerating a
little bit it&#39;s a broad patent now can
someone own this idea now back in the
80s there were no software patents and
it was Xerox that pioneered the
graphical user interface what if they
had patented pop-up menus scroll borrows
the desktop with icons that look like
folders and sheets of paper what a young
and inexperienced Apple have survived
the legal assault a much larger more
mature company like Xerox now this idea
that everything is remix might sound my
common sense until you&#39;re the one
getting remixed for example I mean
Picasso had a saying they say good
artists copy great artists steal and we
have you know always been shameless
about stealing great ideas yes that&#39;s 96
years 2010 I&#39;m going to destroy Android
because it&#39;s a stolen product I&#39;m
willing to go thermonuclear war on this
okay so in other words great artists
steal but not from me now behavioral
economist might refer to this sort of
thing as loss aversion we have a strong
predisposition towards protecting what
we feel is ours we have no such a
version towards copying what other
people have because we do that non-stop
so here&#39;s a sort of equation we&#39;re
looking at we&#39;ve got laws the
fundamentally treat creative works as
property plus massive rewards or
settlements infringement cases plus huge
legal fees to protect yourself in court
plus cognitive biases against perceived
loss the sum looks like this that is the
last four years of lawsuits in the realm
of smartphones is this promoting the
progress of useful arts 1983
Bob Dylan is 42 years old and it&#39;s time
in the cultural spotlight is long since
passed here Accords a song called Blind
Willie McTell named after the blue
singer the song is a voyage through the
past through a much darker time but a
simpler one the time of musicians like
Willie McTell had few illusions about
what they did I jump them from other
writers but I arrange them my own way I
think this is mostly what we do our
creativity comes from without not from
within we are not self-made we are
dependent on one another and emitting
this to ourselves isn&#39;t an embrace of
mediocrity and derivative pneus it&#39;s a
liberation from our misconceptions and
it&#39;s an incentive to not expect so much
from ourselves and to simply begin thank
you so much it was an honor
you
