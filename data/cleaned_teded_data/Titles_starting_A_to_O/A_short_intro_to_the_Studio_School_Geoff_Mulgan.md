what I want to talk about today is is
one idea it&#39;s an idea for a new kind of
school which turns on its head much of
our conventional thinking about what
schools are for and how they work and it
might just be coming to a neighborhood
near you soon where it comes from is an
organization called the Young Foundation
which over many decades has come up with
new innovations in education like the
Open University and things like extended
schools schools for social entrepreneurs
summer universities and the School of
everything and about five years ago we
asked what was the most important need
for innovation in schooling here in the
UK and we felt the most important
priority was to bring together two sets
of problems one was large numbers of
bored teenagers who just didn&#39;t like
school couldn&#39;t see any relationship
between what they learnt in school and
future jobs and employers who kept
complaining that the kids coming out of
school weren&#39;t actually ready for real
work didn&#39;t have the right attitudes and
experience and so we try to ask what
kind of school would have the teenagers
fighting to get in not fighting to stay
out and after hundreds of conversations
with teenagers and teachers and parents
and employers and schools from Paraguay
to Australia and looking at some of the
academic research which showed the
importance of what&#39;s now called
non-cognitive skills of skills of
motivation resilience and that these are
as important as the cognitive skills
formal academic skills we came up with
an answer very simple answer in a way
which we call the studio school and we
called it a studio school to go back to
the original idea of a studio in the
Renaissance where work and learning are
integrated you work by learning and you
learn by working and the design we came
up with have the following
characteristics first of all we wanted
small schools about three four hundred
pupils 14 to 19 year olds and critically
about eighty percent of the curriculum
done not through sitting in classrooms
but through real-life practical projects
working on commission to businesses NGOs
and others that every pupil would have a
coach as well as teachers they would
have timetables much more like a work
environment in a business and all of
this will be
within the public system funded by
public money but independently run and
all at no extra cost no selection and
allowing the pupils the route into
University even if many of them would
want to become entrepreneurs and have
manual jobs as well underlying it was
that some very simple ideas that large
numbers of teenagers learn best by doing
things they learn best in teams and they
learn best by doing things for real all
the opposite of what mainstream
schooling actually does now that was a
nice idea so we moved into the rapid
prototyping phase we tried it out first
in luton famous for its airporter not
much else I fear and in blackpool famous
for its beaches and leisure and what we
found we gotta cut a lot of things wrong
and then improve them but we found that
the young people loved it they found it
much more motivational much more
exciting than traditional education and
perhaps most important of all two years
later when the exam results came through
the pupils who had been put on these
field trials who were in the lowest
performing groups had jumped right to
the top in fact the top pros top decile
a performance in terms of gcse&#39;s which
is the british it sort of marking system
now not surprisingly that influenced
some people to think we were onto
something the minister of education down
south in london described himself as a
big fan and the business organizations
thought we were onto something in terms
of way of preparing children much better
for real life work today and indeed the
head of the chambers of commerce is now
the chairman of the studio schools trust
and helping it work not just with big
businesses but small businesses all over
the country we started with two schools
that&#39;s growing this year to about 10 and
next year we&#39;re expecting about 35
schools open across England and another
40 areas want to have their own schools
opening a pretty rapid spread of this
idea interestingly it&#39;s happened almost
entirely without media coverage it&#39;s
happened almost entirely without big
money behind it it&#39;s spread was entirely
through word-of-mouth virally
cross teachers parents people involved
in education and it spread because of
the power of an idea so the very very
simple idea about turning education on
its head and putting the things which
were marginal things like working in
teams doing practical projects and
putting them right at the heart of
learning rather than on the edges now
there&#39;s a whole set of new schools
opening up this autumn this is one from
Yorkshire where in fact my nephew I hope
will be able to attend it and this one
is focused on creative and media
industries other ones have a focus on
health care tourism engineering and
other fields we think we&#39;re on to
something is not perfect yet but we
think this is one idea which can
transform the lives of thousands
possibly millions of teenagers who are
really bored by schooling it doesn&#39;t
animate them they&#39;re not like all of you
who can sit in rows and hear things you
know said to you for hour after hour
they want to do things they want to get
their hands dirty they want education to
be for real and my hope is that some of
you out there may be able to help us we
feel we&#39;re on the beginning of a journey
of experiment and improvement to turn
the studio school idea into something
which is present not as a universal ants
for every child but at least for an
answer for some children in every part
of the world and I hope that a few of
you at least can help us make that
happen thank you very much
