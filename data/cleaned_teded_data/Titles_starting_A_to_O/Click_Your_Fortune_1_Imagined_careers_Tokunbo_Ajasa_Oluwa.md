I probably first wanted to be an actor
but knew the household I lived in,
that probably wasn&#39;t going to be respected,
so that kind of just stayed in my head.
And then I liked the idea
of being a computer games designer,
and actually started to give that a go.
I used to watch certain movies that I loved.
I started to create what the computer game
would look like and stuff,
but I wasn&#39;t too strong in maths,
so that kind of veered me off from that.
So, they are the two careers
I remember early on aspiring to do.
