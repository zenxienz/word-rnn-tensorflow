In a Moment of Vision...
It&#39;s the winter of 1890.
Dr. William Halsted is the chief surgeon
at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
The scrub nurse under Halsted,
a woman named Caroline Hampton,
begins to develop a severe reaction
to the strong disinfectants
used to scour her hands and arms
before surgery.
Halsted takes an interest in her plight.
In a moment of vision, he asks
Goodyear rubber company
to experiment with the production
of a pair of thin rubber gloves.
They fit Caroline, well, like gloves,
and her hands begin to recover.
In fact, the gloves are such a success
that the good doctor orders more
for his team and for himself.
From these early experiments,
a multibillion dollar rubber glove
industry is born.
And it turns out the doctor didn&#39;t
just want to protect the nurse&#39;s hands.
He also wanted to take them
in holy matrimony.
Halsted and Caroline were married
just a few months after he gave 
her that first pair of gloves.
