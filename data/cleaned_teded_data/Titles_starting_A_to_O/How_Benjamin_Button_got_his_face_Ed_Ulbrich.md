I&#39;m here today representing a team of
artists and technologists and filmmakers
that work together on a remarkable film
project for the last four years and
along the way they created a
breakthrough in computer visualization
so I want to show you a clip of the film
now hopefully it won&#39;t stutter and if we
did our jobs well you won&#39;t know that we
were even involved but you seem to have
more uh-huh
what if I told you I wasn&#39;t getting
older I was getting younger than
everybody else I was born with some form
of disease
what kinda C&#39;s Osborne all
I&#39;m sorry no need to be this at the
wrong old age
are you sick I heard mama and tizzy Miss
penny said I was gonna die soon but
maybe not it different than anybody I&#39;ve
ever met
there were many changes some you could
see some you couldn&#39;t hey I started
growing in all sorts of places along
with other things I felt pretty good
considering that was a clip from The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button many you
maybe you&#39;ve seen it or you&#39;ve heard of
the story but what you might not know is
that for nearly the first hour of the
film the main character Benjamin Button
who&#39;s played by Brad Pitt is completely
computer-generated from the neck up now
there&#39;s no use of prosthetic makeup or
photography of Brad superimposed over
the over another actors body we&#39;ve
created a completely digital human head
so I&#39;d like to start with a little bit
of history on the project this is based
on an F scott Fitzgerald short story
it&#39;s about a man who&#39;s born old and
lives his life in Reverse now this
movies floated around Hollywood for well
over half a century that we first got
involved the project in the early 90s
with Ron Howard as the director we took
a lot of meetings and we seriously
considered it and at the time we had to
throw in the towel it was deemed
impossible it was beyond the technology
of the day to depict a man aging and
back backwards the the human form in
particularly human head has been
considered the holy grail of our
industry the project came back just
about a decade later and this time with
a director named David Fincher now
Fincher is an interesting guy
David is fearless of Technology and he
is absolutely tenacious and David won&#39;t
take no and David believed like we do in
the visual effects industry that
anything is possible as long as you have
enough time resources and of course
money and so David had an interesting
take on the film and he threw a
challenge at us he wanted the film to be
or the main character of the film to be
played from the cradle to the grave by
one actor it happened to be this guy we
went through a process of elimination
and a process of discovery with Dave and
we ruled out of course swapping actors
that was one idea that we would have
different actors we would hand off from
actor to actor and we&#39;ve been ruled out
the idea of using makeup we realized
that prosthetic makeup just wouldn&#39;t
hold
particularly in close-up and makeup is
an additive process you have to build
the face up and David one to carve
deeply into Brad&#39;s face to bring the
aging to this character he needed to be
very sympathetic character so we decided
to cast a series of little people that
would play the different bodies of
Benjamin at different increments of his
life and that we would in fact create a
computer-generated version of Brad&#39;s
head aged to appears Benjamin and attach
that to the body of the real actor
sounded great of course this was the
holy grail of our our industry and the
fact that this guy is a global icon
didn&#39;t help either because I&#39;m sure if
anybody ever stand in line at the
grocery store you know we see his face
constantly so there really was no
tolerable margin of error there were two
studios involved Warner Brothers and
Paramount and they both believed this
would make an amazing film of course it
was a very high-risk proposition there
was lots of money in reputations at
stake and we believed that we had a very
solid methodology that might work but
despite our verbal assurances they
wanted some proof and so in 2004 they
commissioned us to do a screen test of
Benjamin and we did it about five weeks
but we use lots of cheats and shortcuts
we basically put something together to
get through the meeting and I&#39;ll roll
that for you now this was the first test
for Benjamin Button and in here you can
see it&#39;s a that&#39;s a computer-generated
head it&#39;s pretty good
attached to the body of another actor
and it worked and it gave the studio
great relief after many years of starts
and stops on this project and and making
that tough decision they finally decided
to greenlight the movie and I can
remember actually when I got the phone
call to congratulate us that the the
move was a go I actually threw up
you know this is tough stuff so we
started to have early team meetings and
and we got everybody together and it was
really more like therapy in the
beginning of convincing each other and
reassuring each other that we can
actually undertake this we had to hold
up an hour of a movie with a character
and it&#39;s not a special-effects film it
has to be a man we really felt like we
were you know kind of like a 12-step
program and of course you know the first
step is it mate you&#39;ve got a problem so
um and we had a big problem we didn&#39;t
know how we&#39;re gonna do this and but we
did know one thing being from the visual
effects industry we with David believed
that we now had enough time enough
resources and God we hoped we had enough
money and we had enough passion to will
the processes and technology into
existence so when you&#39;re faced with
something like that adversity I&#39;ve got
to break it down you take the big
problem you break it down into smaller
pieces you can start to attack that so
we had three main areas that we had to
focus on we needed to make Brad look a
lot older we needed to age him 45 years
or so and we also needed to make sure
that we could take Brad&#39;s idiosyncrasies
his little ticks the little subtleties
that make him who he is and have that
translate through our process so that it
appears in Benjamin on the screen and we
also needed to create a character that
could hold up under really all
conditions you needed to be able to walk
in broad daylight at nighttime under
candlelight he had to hold an extreme
closeup he had to deliver dialogue he
had to be able to run he had to be able
to sweat he had to be able to take a
bath to cry he even had to throw up not
all at the same time but he had to you
know do all of those those things and
the work had to hold up for almost the
first hour of the movie we did about 325
shots so we needed a system that would
allow Benjamin to be able to do
everything a human being can do and we
realized that there was a giant chasm
between the state of the art of
Technology in about 2004 and where we
needed it to be so we focused on motion
capture now I&#39;m sure many of you have
seen motion capture and and the state of
the art at the time was something called
marker based motion capture I&#39;ll show
you an example here it&#39;s basically the
idea of you wear a leotard and they put
some reflective markers on your body and
instead of using cameras there&#39;s
infrared sensors around a volume and
those infrared sensors track the three
position of those markers in real time
and then animators can take the data of
the motion of those markers and apply
them to a computer-generated character
so you can see the computer characters
on the right are having the same complex
motion as the as the dancers so we also
looked at numbers of other films of the
time that were using facial marker
tracking and that&#39;s the idea of putting
markers on the human face and doing the
same process and as you can see it gives
you a pretty crappy performance that&#39;s
not terribly compelling and what we
realized was that what we needed was the
information what was going on between
the markers we needed the subtleties of
the skin we needed to see skin moving
over muscle over bone heat increases in
dimples and wrinkles and all of those
things so our first big revelation was
to completely abort and walk away from
the technology of the day the status quo
the state of the art and so we aborted
using motion capture and we were now
well out of our comfort zone and an
uncharted territory so we were left with
this idea that we ended up kind of
calling technologies Stu we started to
look out in other fields and the idea
was that we were going to find nuggets
or gems of technology that perhaps come
from other industries like medical
imaging or the video game space and
Andrea propriate them and we had to
create kind of a sauce and the sauce was
a code and software that we written to
allow these disparate pieces of
technologies to come together and work
as one and so initially we came across
some remarkable research done by a
gentleman named dr. Paul Ekman in the
early 70s and he believed that he could
in fact catalog the human face and he
came up with his idea of facial action
coding system he believed that there are
basically 70 basic poses or shapes of
the human face and that from those basic
poses or shapes of the face they can be
combined to create infinite
possibilities of everything the human
face is capable of doing and of course
these transcend age race culture gender
and so this was a became kind of the
foundation of our research as we went
forward and then we came across some
remarkable technology called contour and
here you can see a subject having
phosphorescent makeup stippled on her
face and now what we&#39;re looking at is
really of creating a surface capture as
opposed to a marker capture the subject
stands in front of a computer array
cameras and those cameras can
frame-by-frame reconstruct geometry of
exactly what the subject is doing at the
moment right so effectively you get 3d
data in real time of the subject and if
you look in a comparison on the left we
see what volumetric data gives us and on
the right you see what markers give us
so clearly we were in a substantially
better place for this but these were the
early days of this technology and it
wasn&#39;t really proven yet but you know we
measure complexity and fidelity of data
in terms of polygonal count and so on
the left we were seeing a hundred
thousand polygons we can go up into the
millions of polygons it seemed to be
infinite this is when we had our AHA
this was the breakthrough this is one
like okay we&#39;re gonna be okay this is
actually gonna work and the AHA was what
if we could take Brad Pitt and we could
put Brad in this device and use this
contour process and we could stipple on
the phosphorescent makeup and put him
under the black lights and we could in
fact scan him in real time performing
Ekman&#39;s facts poses right so effectively
we ended up with a 3d database of
everything Brad Pitt&#39;s face is capable
of doing so from there we actually
carved up those faces into smaller
pieces and components of his face so we
ended up with literally thousands and
thousands and thousands of shapes a
complete database of all possibilities
that his face is capable of of doing now
that&#39;s great except we had him at age 44
we need to put another 40 years on him
at this point we brought in Rick Baker
and Rick&#39;s one of the great makeup and
special effects viewers of our industry
and and we also brought in a gentleman
named kazoo soo-ji and cause of soo-ji
is one of the great photo real sculptors
of our time and we commissioned them to
make a maquette or a bust of a Benjamin
and so in the spirit of the great
unveiling I had to do this I had to I
had to unveil something so this has been
a tea right now with we created three of
these there&#39;s been a T there&#39;s been 70
there&#39;s been 60 and this really became
the the template of moving forward now
this was made from a life cast of Brad
so in fact anatomically it is correct
the eyes the jaw the teeth everything is
in perfect alignment with what the real
guy has we have these maquettes scanned
in
computer at at very high resolution an
enormous polygonal count and so now we
had three age increments of Benjamin in
the computer but we needed to get a
database of him doing more than that so
we went through this process then called
retargeting so this is Brad doing one of
the ecumene facts poses and here&#39;s the
resulting data that comes from that of
the model that comes from that and
retargeting is the process of
transposing that data onto another model
and because the lifecast are the bust
the maquette of Benjamin was made from
Brad we could transpose the data of Brad
at forty four on to Brad at eighty seven
so now we had a 3d database of
everything Brad Pitt&#39;s face can do at
age 87 in his 70s and then in his 60s
next we had to go into the shooting
process so while that&#39;s going on we&#39;re
down in New Orleans and locations around
the world and we shot our body actors
and we shot them wearing blue hoods so
these are the gentleman who played
Benjamin and the blue hoods helped us
for two things one we could easily erase
their heads and we also put tracking
markers on their heads so in fact we
could recreate the camera motion of the
lens optics from the set but now we
needed to get Brad&#39;s performance to
drive our virtual Benjamin and so we
edited the footage that was shot on
location with the rest of the cast and
the the body actors and about six months
later we brought Brad onto a soundstage
in Los Angeles and he watched on the
screen and his job then was to become
Benjamin and so we looped the scenes he
watched again and again we encourage him
to improvise and he took Benjamin in
interesting unusual places that we
didn&#39;t think he was going to go we shot
him a four HD camera so we get multiple
views of him and then David would choose
the take of Brad being Benjamin that he
thought best matched the footage with
the rest of the cast and from there we
went into a process called image
analysis and so here you can see again
the chosen take and we are seeing now
that data being transposed on to Ben
eighty-seven and so what&#39;s interesting
about this is we use something called
image analysis which is taking timings
from different components of Benjamin&#39;s
face so we could choose say his left
eyebrow and the software would tell us
that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow
begins to move from here to here it
concludes moving in frame 32 and so we
could choose
members of positions on the face to pull
that data from and then the sauce I
talked about with our technologies to
that secret sauce was effectively
software that allowed us to match the
performance footage of Brad in
live-action with our database of aged
Benjamin the the fact shapes that we had
and on a frame-by-frame basis we can
actually reconstruct a 3d head that
exactly matched the performance of Brad
so this is how the finished shot
appeared in the film and here you can
see the body actor and then this is what
we called the dead head no reference to
Jerry Garcia and then here&#39;s the
reconstructed performance now with the
timings of the performance and then
again the final shot it was a long
process
the neck next section here I&#39;m gonna
just blast through this because we could
do it a whole TED talk on the next you
know several slides we had to create a
lighting system so really a big part of
our processes from creating a lighting
environment for every single location
that Benjamin had to appear so that we
could put Ben&#39;s head into any scene and
what is exactly matched the lighting
that&#39;s on the other actors in the real
world we also had to create an eye
system we found the the old adage you
know the eyes of the window to the soul
is absolutely true so the goal here was
to keep everybody looking in Ben&#39;s eyes
and if you could feel the warmth and
feel the humanity and feel his intent
coming through the eyes then we would
succeed so we had one person focused on
the eye system for almost two full years
we also had to create a mouth system we
worked from dental molds of Bradway they
aged the teeth over time we also had to
create an articulating tongue that
allowed him to enunciate his word so
there&#39;s a whole system and software
written to articulate the tongue we had
one person devoted the tongue for about
nine months he was he was very popular
skin displacement another big deal the
skin had to be absolutely accurate and
he&#39;s also in an old-age home he&#39;s in a
nursing home around other old people so
he had to look exactly the same as the
others so lots of work on skin
deformation you can see in some of these
cases it works in some cases it looks
bad this is a very very very early test
in our process so effectively we created
a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could
operate with his own face there were no
animators necessary to come in and
interpret behavior or enhance his
performance there was something we
encountered though that we end up kind
of calling the digital Botox effect so
as things kind of went through this
process it did kind of Fincher would
always say it&#39;s and blasts the edges off
of the performance and one thing that
our our process and the technology
couldn&#39;t do is it couldn&#39;t understand
intent the intent of the actor so it
sees a smile as a smile it doesn&#39;t
recognize an ironic smile or a happy
smile or frustrated smile so did take
humans to kind of push it that one way
or the other but that we ended up
calling the entire process and all the
technology emotion capture as opposed to
just motion capture so take another look
Wow
I heard mama and tizzy whispering they
said I was gonna die soon but maybe not
well I heard mama and tizzy whispering I
said I was gonna die soon but
maybe not
well I heard mama and tizzy whispering I
said I was gonna die soon but maybe not
that&#39;s how to create a digital human in
18 minutes
a couple of quick factoids it really
took 155 people over two years and we
didn&#39;t even talk about 60 hairstyles and
an all-digital haircut but that is
Benjamin thank you
