welcome to Thailand now when I was a
young man 40 years ago the country is
very very poor with lots and lots and
lots of people living in poverty we
decided to do something about it but we
didn&#39;t begin with the welfare program or
a poverty reduction program but we began
with a family planning program following
a very successful maternal child health
activity sets of activities so basically
no one would accept family planning if
that children didn&#39;t survive
so the first step get to the children
get to the mothers and then follow up
with family planning not just child
mortality alone you need also family
planning now let me take you back as to
why we needed to do it in my country
that was the case in 1974 seven children
four family tremendous growth at three
point three percent
there was just no future we needed to
reduce the poverty interest rate so we
said let&#39;s do it the women said we agree
we&#39;ll use pills but we needed doctors to
prescribe the pills and we had very very
few doctors so we didn&#39;t take no as an
answer we took no as a question so we
went to the nurses and the midwives who
were also women and did a fantastic job
at explaining how to use the pill that
was wonderful but it covered only 20% of
the country what do we do for the other
80% leave them alone and say well
they&#39;re not medical personnel no we
decided to do a bit more so we went to
the ordinary people that you saw
actually below that yellow sign I wish
they hadn&#39;t wiped that because there was
coca-cola that
we were so much bigger than coca-cola in
those days and no difference the people
they chose were the people we chose they
are well known in the community they
knew that customers were always right
and they were terrific and they
practiced their family planning
themselves so they could supply pills
and condoms throughout the country in
every village of the country so there we
are we went to the people who were seen
as the cause of the problem to be the
solution so wherever there were people
and you can see much from the women
selling things here&#39;s the floating
market selling bananas and crabs and
also contraceptives wherever you find
people you will find contraceptives in
Thailand and then we decided why not get
to religion because in the Philippines
the Catholic Church was pretty strong
and type II were Buddhist so we went to
them and they said look could you help
us so I&#39;m there the one in blue not the
yellow holding a ball of holy water for
the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills
and condoms for the sanctity of the
family and this picture was sent
throughout the country so some of the
monks in the villages were doing the
same thing themselves and the women was
saying no wonder we have no side effects
it&#39;s been blessed that was that
perception and then we went to teachers
you need you need everybody to be
involved in trying to provide whatever
it is that makes humanity a better place
so we were to the teachers over quarter
of a million were told about family
planning with new alphabet av4 Bercy for
condom either i UDV vasectomy and then
we had a snakes and ladders game when
you throw dice if you land on anything
pro-family planning you move ahead like
mother takes the pill every night put
very good mother movie uncle buys condom
very good uncle move ahead uncle get
strong dose use condom come back start
again
again education plus entertainment and
their kids were doing it in schools too
we had real iterations with condoms
we had children&#39;s condom blowing
championship and before long the condom
was known as the girl&#39;s best friend in
Thailand for poor people diamonds don&#39;t
make it so the condom is the girl&#39;s best
friend we introduced our first
microcredit program in 1975 and the
women who organized it said we only want
to lend to women who practice family
planning if you&#39;re pregnant take care of
your pregnancy if you&#39;re not pregnant
you can take a loan not from us and that
was run by them and after 35 36 years
it&#39;s still going on it&#39;s part of the
village Development Bank it&#39;s not a real
Bank but so fun microcredit and we
didn&#39;t need a big organization to run it
it was run by the villages themselves
and you probably hardly seen a Thai man
there it&#39;s always women women women
women and then we thought we&#39;d help
America because America has been helping
everyone whether they want help or not
and this is on the 4th of July we
decided to provide resecting me to all
men but in particular American men to
the front of the queue right opposed to
the ambassador&#39;s residence during his
Van Daan and the hotel gave us the
ballroom for it very appropriate room
and since it was near lunchtime they
said all right we&#39;ll give you some lunch
of course it must be American Cola
you&#39;ve got two brands Coke and Pepsi and
then the food
it&#39;s either hamburger or hotdog and I
thought a hotdog would be more symbolic
and and here is this then young man for
Willy boom who worked the USAID
obviously he&#39;s had this vasectomy
because his hotdogs half-eaten and he
was very happy it made a lot of news in
America and it angered some people also
I said don&#39;t worry come over I&#39;ll do the
whole lot of you and what happened you
know all this thing from 7 children to
1.5 children population growth rate of
3.3 to 0.5 you could call it the Coca
Cola approach if you like it is exactly
the same thing and not sure where the
Coca Cola followed us so we followed
Coca Cola but we&#39;re good friends and so
that&#39;s the case of everyone joining in
we had didn&#39;t have a strong government
we didn&#39;t have lots of doctors but it&#39;s
everybody&#39;s job who can change attitude
and behavior then age came along and hit
Thailand and we have to stop doing a lot
of good things to fight AIDS but
unfortunately the government was in
denial denial denial so I work wasn&#39;t
effective so I thought well if we can&#39;t
go to the government go to the military
so I went to the military and ask to
borrow 300 greenio stations they have
more than the government and they got
more guns than the government so I asked
him could they help us in our fight
against HIV and after I gave them
statistics they said yes okay you can
use all the radio stations television
stations and that&#39;s when we went on to
the airwaves and then we had a new prime
minister soon after that and he said
which I could you come and join he asked
me in because he liked my wife a lot so
I said okay he became the chairman of
National AIDS committee and increased
the budget 50 for every ministry even
judges had to be involved with AIDS
education everyone and we said the
public institutions religious
institutions schools everyone was
involved and here every media person had
to be trained for HIV and we gave every
station half a minute extra for
advertising to earn more money so they
were happy with that and then AIDS
education in all schools starting from
University and these are high school
kids teaching high school kids and the
best teachers were the girls not the
boys and they were terrific and these
girls who go around teaching about safe
sex and HIV were known as mother Teresa
and then we went down one more step
these are primary school kids third
fourth grade going to every household in
the village every household in the whole
of Thailand giving its information and a
condom to every household given by these
young kids and no parents objected
because we were save just trying to save
lives and this was a life saver
and we said everyone needs to be
involved so you have the companies also
realizing that sick start on work and
dead customers don&#39;t buy so they all
train and then we have this captain
condom with his Harvard MBA going to
schools and nice spots and they&#39;d have
to do you need a symbol of something you
know in every country every program you
need a symbol and this is probably the
best thing he&#39;s ever done with MBA and
then we gave condoms up everywhere in
the street everywhere everywhere in
taxis you get condoms and also in
traffic the policemen give you hundreds
are cops and robbers program
so can you imagine New York policemen
giving out come down of course I can and
they&#39;d enjoy it immensely item standing
around right now everywhere imagine if
they had condom that giving out to all
sorts of people and then your new change
we had hair band clothing and the condom
for your mobile phone during the rainy
season and these were the condoms that
we introduced one says weapon of mass
protection we found you know somebody
here was searching for the weapon of
mass destruction well we have found the
weapon of mass protection the condom and
then it says here with the American flag
don&#39;t leave home without it but I have
some to give out afterwards but let me
warn you these are toy size so be very
careful and so so you can suit you can
see that condoms can condoms can do so
many things look at this I gave this to
Al Gore and to build senior also stop
global warming use condoms and then this
is the picture I mentioned to you that
the weapon of mass protection and let
the next Olympics save some lives why
just run around and then
and then finally in Thailand where
Buddhists we don&#39;t have a God so instead
we say in rubber we trust so you can see
that we added everything - I endeavour
to make life better for the people we
had condoms in all the refrigerators in
the hotels in the schools because
alcohol impairs judgment and then what
happened after all this time everybody
joined in according to you and it
declined by new cases of HIV declined by
90 percent and according to the World
Bank seven point seven million lives
were saved otherwise there wouldn&#39;t be
many Thais walking around today so just
showed you you could do something about
it
90 percent of the funding came from
Thailand there was political commitment
some financial commitment and everybody
joined in the fight so just don&#39;t leave
it to the specialists and doctors and
nurses we all need to help and then we
decided to help people out of poverty
now that we got it&#39;s somewhat out of the
way this time not with governmental Road
but in cooperation with the business
community because poor people are
business people who lack business skills
and access to credit those are the
things to be provided by the business
community we&#39;re trying to turn them into
barefoot entrepreneurs little business
people the only way out of poverty is
through business enterprise so that was
done so the money goes from the company
into the village via tree planting so
it&#39;s not a free gift they plant the
trees and the money goes into their
microcredit fund which we call the
village development back everybody joins
in and they feel they own the bank
because they&#39;d brought the money in and
before that you can borrow the money you
can need to be trained and we believe in
what will help the poor those are living
in poverty access to credit must be a
human right access to credit must be a
human right otherwise they&#39;ll never get
out of poverty and then before getting a
loan you must be trained here&#39;s a what
we call a barefoot MBA teaching people
how to do business so that when they
borrow our money they&#39;ll succeed with
the business so these are some of the
Bissell&#39;s mushrooms crabs vegetables
trees fruits and this is very
interesting
Nike ice-cream and Nike biscuits this is
a village sponsored by Nike
they said they should stop making shoes
and clothes make these better because we
can afford them
and then we have silk tie silk now we&#39;re
making Scottish patterns as you can see
on the left to sell to all people of
Scottish ancestors so anyone sitting in
and watching TV can in touch with me and
then this is our answer to Starbucks
internet coffee and condoms see
Starbucks keeps you awake we keep you
awake and alive can you imagine that
every Starbucks that you can also get
condoms so you can order your condoms
with your cappuccino and then now
finally in education we want to change
the school as being underutilized into a
place where it&#39;s a lifelong learning
center for everyone we call this our
school-based integrated rural
development and it&#39;s a center a focal
point for economic and social
development so we do the school make it
serve the community needs and here is a
bamboo building all of them are bamboo
this is a geodesic dome made of bamboo
and I&#39;m sure Buckminster Fuller would be
very very proud to see a bamboo geodesic
dome and we use vegetables around the
school ground so they raise their own
vegetables and then finally I firmly
believe if we want the MDGs to work the
Millennium Development Goals we need to
add family planning to it of course our
mortality first and then family planning
everyone needs family planning service
it&#39;s underutilized so we have now found
a weapon of mass protection and we also
ask the next Olympics to be involved in
saving lives and then finally that is
our network and these are Thai tulips
thank you very much indeed
