so I want to talk today about money and
happiness which are two things that a
lot of us spend a lot of our time
thinking about either trying to earn
them or trying to increase them and a
lot of us resonate with this phrase so
we see it in religions and self-help
books that money can&#39;t buy happiness and
I want to suggest today that in fact
that&#39;s wrong and that I&#39;m out of
business school so that&#39;s what we do so
that that&#39;s wrong and in fact if you
think that you&#39;re actually just not
spending it right so that instead of
spending it the way you usually spend it
maybe if you spent it differently that
might work a little bit better and
before I tell you the ways that you can
spend it that will make you happier
let&#39;s think about the ways we usually
spend it that don&#39;t in fact make us
happier we had a little natural
experiment so CNN a little while ago
wrote this interesting article and what
happens to people when they win the
lottery it turns out people think when
they win the lottery their lives are
going to be amazing this article is
about how their lives get ruined so what
happens when people win the lottery is
number one they spend all the money and
going to death and number two all of
their friends and everyone they&#39;ve ever
met find them and bug them for money and
it ruins their social relationships in
fact so they have more debt and worse
friendships than they had before they
won the lottery what was interesting
about the article was people started
commenting on the article readers of the
thing and instead of talking about how
it had made them realize that money
doesn&#39;t lead to happiness everyone
instantly started saying you know what I
would do if I won the lottery and
fantasizing about what they do and
here&#39;s a just two of the ones that we
saw that are just really interesting to
think about one person wrote in when I
win I&#39;m going to buy my own little
mountain and have a little house on top
and another person wrote I would fill a
big bathtub with money and get in the
tub while smoking a big fat cigar and
sipping a glass of champagne this is
even worse now then I&#39;d have a picture
taken and dozens of glossy&#39;s made anyone
begging for money or trying to extort
from me would receive a copy of the
picture and nothing else and so many of
the comments were exactly of this type
where people got money and in fact it
made them anti-social so we I told you
that it ruins people&#39;s lives and that
their friends bug them it also money
often makes us feel very selfish and we
do things only for ourself and we said
well maybe the reason that money doesn&#39;t
make us happy is that we&#39;re always
spending it on the wrong things and in
particular that we&#39;re always spending it
on ourselves and we thought I wonder
what would happen if we made people
spend more of their money on other
people so instead of being antisocial
with your money what if you were a
little bit more pro-social with your
money and we thought let&#39;s make people
do it and see what happens so let&#39;s have
some people do what they usually do and
spend money on themselves and let&#39;s make
some people give money away and measure
their happiness and see if in fact they
get happier so the first way that we did
this on one vancouver morning we went
out on the campus at university of
british columbia and we approach people
and said you want to be in an experiment
if they said yes we gave we asked them
how happy they were and then we gave
them an envelope and one of the
envelopes had things in it that said by
5pm today spend this money on yourself
so when we gave some examples of what
you could spend it on other people in
the morning got a slip of paper that
said by 5pm today spend this money on
somebody else also inside the envelope
was money and we manipulated how much
money we gave them so some people got
this slip of paper and five dollars some
people got this slip of paper and twenty
dollars we let them go about their day
they did whatever they wanted to do we
found out that they did in fact spend it
in the way that we asked them to we
called them up at night and asked them
what you spend it on and how happy do
you feel now what did they spend it on
well these are college undergrads so a
lot of what they spent it on for
themselves was things like earrings and
makeup one woman said she bought a
stuffed animal for her nice people gave
money to homeless people huge effect
here of starbucks so
if you give undergraduates five dollars
it looks like coffee to them and they&#39;ve
run over to starbucks and spend that as
fast as they can but some people bought
a coffee for themselves the way they
usually would but other people said that
they bought a coffee for somebody else
so the very same purchase just targeted
toward yourself are targeted towards
some somebody else what did we find when
we call them back at the end of the day
people who spent money on other people
got happier people who spend money on
themselves nothing happened it didn&#39;t
make them less happy it just didn&#39;t do
much for them and the other thing we saw
is that the amount of money doesn&#39;t
matter that much so people thought that
twenty dollars would be way better than
five dollars in fact it doesn&#39;t matter
how much money you spent what really
matters is that you spent it on somebody
else rather than on yourself we see this
again and again when we give people
money to spend on other people instead
of on themselves of course these are
undergraduates in Canada not the world&#39;s
most representative population they&#39;re
also fairly wealthy and affluent all
these other sorts of things we wanted to
see if this holds true everywhere in the
world or just among wealthy countries so
we went in fact to Uganda and ran a very
similar experiment so imagine instead of
just people can and we say name the last
time you spent money on yourself or
other people describe it how happy did
it make you or in Uganda name the last
time you spent money on yourself or
other people and described that and then
we asked them how happy they are again
and what we see is sort of amazing
because there&#39;s human universals on what
you do with your money and then real
cultural differences on what you do as
well so for example one guy from Uganda
says this he says I called a girl I wish
to love we basically went out on a date
and he says at the end that he didn&#39;t
achieve her up till now here&#39;s a guy
from Canada very similar thing I took my
girlfriend out for dinner we went to a
movie we left early and then went back
to a room for only cake just this case
human Universal so you spend money on
other people you&#39;re being nice to them
maybe of something in mind maybe not but
then we see extraordinary differences so
look at these two this is a woman from
Canada we say name a time you spent
money on somebody else she says you know
I bought a present for my mom I drove to
the mall in my car bought a present gave
it to my mom perfectly nice thing to do
it&#39;s good to get gifts for people that
you know compare that to this woman from
Uganda I was walking in metal longtime
friend whose whose son was sick with
malaria they had no money they went to a
clinic and I gave her this money this is
in ten thousand dollars it&#39;s the local
currency so it&#39;s a very small amount of
money in fact but enormously different
motivations here this is a real medical
need literally a life-saving donation
above it&#39;s just kind of I got bought a
gift for my mother what we see again
though is that the specific way that you
spend on other people isn&#39;t nearly as
important as the fact that you spend on
other people in order to make yourself
happy which is really quite important so
you don&#39;t have to do amazing things with
your money to make yourself happy you
can do small trivial things and yet
still get these benefits from doing this
these are only two countries we also
wanted to go even broader and look at
every country in the world if we could
to see what the relationship is between
money and happiness we got data from the
Gallup Organization which you know from
all the political polls that have been
happening lately they asked people did
you donate money to charity recently and
they asked them how happy are you with
your life in general and we can see what
the relationship is between those two
things are they positively correlated
giving money makes you happy or they
negatively correlated on this map Green
will mean they&#39;re positively correlated
and red means they&#39;re negatively
correlated and you can see the world is
crazily green so in every almost every
country in the world where we have this
data people who give money to charity
are happier people than people who don&#39;t
give money to charity I know you&#39;re all
looking at that red country in the
middle I would be a jerk and not tell
you what it is but it&#39;s in fact its
central african republic you can make up
stories out maybe it&#39;s different there
for some reason or another just below
that to the right is rwanda though which
is amazingly green so almost everywhere
we look we see that giving money away
makes you happier than keeping it for
yourself what about your work life which
is where we spend all the rest of our
time when we&#39;re not with the people we
know we decided to infiltrate some
companies and do a very similar thing so
these are sales teams in Belgium they
work in teams they go out and sell
basically to dr.
and try to get them to buy drugs so we
can look to see how well they sell
things as a function of being a member
of a team some teams we give people on
the team some money for themselves and
say spend it however you want on
yourself just like we did with the
undergrads in Canada but other teams we
say here&#39;s 15 euro spend it on one of
your teammates this week buy them
something as a gift or a president give
it to them and then we can see when now
we&#39;ve got teams that spend on themselves
and we&#39;ve got these pro-social teams so
we give money to make the team a little
better the reason I have a ridiculous
pinata there is one of the teams pulled
their money in bought a pinata and they
all got around and smash the pinata and
all the candy fell out and things like
that a very silly trivial thing to do
but think of the difference on a team
that didn&#39;t do that at all that got 15
euro put it in their pocket maybe bought
themselves a coffee or teams that had
this pro-social experience where they
all bonded together to buy something and
do a group activity what we see is that
in fact the teams that are pro-social
sell more stuff than the teams that only
got money for themselves and one way to
think about it is for every 15 euro you
give people for themselves they put it
in their pocket they don&#39;t do anything
different than they did before you don&#39;t
get any money from that you actually
lose money because it doesn&#39;t motivate
them to perform any better but when you
give them 15 euro to spend on their
teammates they do so much better on
their teams that you actually get a huge
win on investing this kind of money and
I realize that you&#39;re probably thinking
to yourselves this is all fine but
there&#39;s a context that&#39;s incredibly
important for public policy and I can&#39;t
imagine it would work there and if
basically if he doesn&#39;t show me that it
works here I don&#39;t believe anything he
said and I know that what you&#39;re all
thinking about a dodge ball teams this
was a huge criticism that we got you
know to say if you can&#39;t show with dodge
ball teams this is all stupid so we went
out and found these dodgeball teams and
infiltrated them and we did the exact
same thing as before so some teams we
give people on the team money they spend
it on themselves other teams we give the
money to spend on their dodgeball
teammates the teams that spend money on
themselves they&#39;re just the same winning
percentages they were before the teams
that we give the money to spend on each
other they become different teams and in
fact they dominate the league by the
time they&#39;re done across all of these
different contexts your personal life
your work life even silly things like
intramural sports we see spending on
other people has a bigger return for you
than spending on yourself and so I&#39;ll
just say I think if you think money
can&#39;t buy happiness you&#39;re not spending
it right the implication is not you know
you should buy this product instead of
that
product and that&#39;s the way to make
yourself happier it&#39;s in fact that you
should stop thinking about which product
to buy for yourself and try giving some
of it to other people instead and we
luckily have an opportunity for you
donorschoose.org is is a non-profit for
mainly public school teachers and
low-income schools they post projects so
they say I want to teach Huckleberry
Finn to my class and we don&#39;t have the
books or I want a microscope to show my
teach my students science and we don&#39;t
have a microscope you and I can go on
and buy it for them the teacher writes
you a thank you note the kids write you
a thank-you note sometimes they send you
pictures of them using the microscope
it&#39;s an extraordinary thing go to the
website and start yourself on the
process of thinking again less about how
can I spend money on myself and more
about if I&#39;ve got five dollars or
fifteen dollars what can I do to benefit
other people because ultimately when you
do that you&#39;ll find out you&#39;ll benefit
yourself much more thank you
