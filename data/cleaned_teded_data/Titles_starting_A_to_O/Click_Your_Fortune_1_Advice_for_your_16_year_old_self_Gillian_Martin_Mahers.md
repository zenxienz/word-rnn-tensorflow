Don&#39;t stop singing.
And that&#39;s because at a certain point
when I became 16 or 17,
I stopped singing
and really being used to hearing my voice.
And for many years,
I wasn&#39;t comfortable in front of people,
speaking,
sharing my opinions,
just making my thoughts known
and available for other people.
And I think that it took me a long time
to find my voice again.
And I think if I hadn&#39;t stopped singing
and being in front of people like that,
I would have probably been able
to share a lot more of what I thought
in those important years.
