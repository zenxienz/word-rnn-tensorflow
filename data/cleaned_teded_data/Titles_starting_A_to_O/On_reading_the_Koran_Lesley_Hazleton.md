you may have heard about the Qurans idea
of paradise being 72 virgins and I
promise I will come back to those
virgins but in fact here in the
northwest we&#39;re living very close to the
real Quranic idea of paradise to find 36
times as gardens watered by running
streams since I live in a houseboat on
the running stream of Lake Union this
makes perfect sense to me but the thing
is how come it&#39;s news to most people I
know many well-intentioned non-muslims
who&#39;ve begun reading the Quran but given
up disconcerted by its evenness the
historian Thomas Carlyle considered
Muhammad one of the world&#39;s greatest
heroes yet even he called the Quran as
toilsome reading as I ever undertook a
wearisome confused jumble part of the
problem I think is that we imagine that
the Quran can be read as we usually read
a book so we can curl up with it on his
veiny afternoon with a bowl of popcorn
Within Reach as the god and the Quran is
entirely in the voice of God speaking to
Muhammad were just another author on the
bestseller list yet the fact that so few
people do actually read the Quran is
precisely why it&#39;s so easy to quote that
is to misquote phrases and snippets
taken out of context in what I call the
highlighter version which is the one
favored by both Muslim fundamentalists
and anti Muslim Islamophobes
so this past spring as I was gearing up
to begin writing a biography of Muhammad
I realized I needed to read the Quran
properly as properly as I could that is
my Arabic is reduced by now to wielding
a dictionary so I took four well-known
translations and decided to read them
side by side verse by verse along with a
transliteration and the original 7th
century Arabic
now I did have an advantage my last book
was about the story behind the
shia-sunni split and for that I&#39;d worked
closely with the earliest Islamic
histories so I knew the events to which
the Quran constantly refers its frame of
reference I knew enough that is to know
that I&#39;d be a tourist in the Koran and
informed one experienced one even but
still an outsider an agnostic Jew
reading someone else&#39;s holy book so I
read slowly I&#39;d set aside three weeks
for this project and that I think is
what is meant by hubris because it it
turned out to be three months I did
resist the temptation to skip to the
back with a shorter more clearly
mystical chapters are but every time I
thought I was beginning to get a handle
on the Quran that feeling of I get it
now it is a slip away overnight
and I&#39;d come back in the morning
wondering if I wasn&#39;t lost in a strange
land and yet the terrain was very
familiar the Quran declares that it
comes to renew the message of the Torah
and the Gospels so one-third of it
reprises the stories of biblical figures
like Abraham Moses Joseph Mary Jesus God
Himself was utterly familiar from his
earlier manifestation as Yahweh
jealously insisting on no other gods the
presence of camels mountains desert
wells and Springs took me back to the
year I spent wandering the Sinai desert
and then there was the language the
rhythmic cadence of it reminding me of
evenings spent listening to Bedouin
elders recite hours long narrative poems
entirely from memory and I began to
grasp why
it said that the Quran is really the
Quran only in Arabic take the fatiha the
7 verse opening chapter that is the
Lord&#39;s Prayer my sphere of Islam
combined it&#39;s just 29 words in Arabic
but anywhere from 65 to 72 in
translation and yet the more you add the
more seems to go missing the Arabic has
an incantation almost hypnotic quality
that begs to be heard rather than read
felt more than analyzed it wants to be
chanted out loud to sound its music in
the ear and on the tongue so the Quran
in English is a kind of shadow over
itself or as Arthur I&#39;ve recalled his
version an interpretation but all is not
lost in translation as the Quran
promises patience is rewarded and there
are many surprises a degree of
environmental awareness for instance and
of humans as mere stewards of God&#39;s
creation unmatched in the Bible and
where the Bible is addressed exclusively
to men using the second and third person
masculine the Quran includes women
talking for instance of believing men
and believing women honorable men and
honorable women or take the infamous
verse about killing the unbelievers yes
it does say that but in a very specific
context the anticipated conquest of the
sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting
was usually forbidden and the permission
comes hedged about with qualifiers not
you must kill unbelievers in mecco but
you can you are allowed to but only
after a grace period is over and only if
there&#39;s no other pact in place and only
if they try to stop you getting to the
Kaaba and only if they attack you first
and even then God is merciful
forgiveness is supreme
and so essentially better if you don&#39;t
this was perhaps the biggest surprise
how flexible the Koran is at least in
mines that are not fundamentally
inflexible some of these verses are
definite in meaning it says and others
are ambiguous the perverse of heart will
seek out the ambiguities trying to
create discord by pinning down meanings
of their own only God knows the true
meaning the phrase God is subtle appears
again and again and indeed the whole of
the Quran is far more subtle than most
of us have been led to believe as in for
instance that little matter of versions
and paradise old-fashioned Orientalism
comes into play here the word used four
times is Parise rendered as a dark-eyed
maidens with swelling breasts or as
affair hypose and virgins here all there
is in the original Arabic is that one
word who is not a swelling breast or
hybrid zoom inside
now this may be a way of saying pure
beings like in angels or it may be like
Greek cross or koi an internal use but
the truth is nobody really knows and
that&#39;s the point because the quran is
quite clear when it says that you&#39;ll be
a new creation in paradise and that you
will be recreated in a form unknown to
you it seems to me a far more appealing
prospect than a virgin
and that number 72 never appears there
are no 72 virgins in the run that idea
and he came into being 300 years later
and most Islamic scholars see it as the
equivalent of people with wings sitting
on clouds and strumming harps paradise
is quite the opposite it&#39;s not virginity
its fecundity it&#39;s plenty its Gardens
water by running streams
