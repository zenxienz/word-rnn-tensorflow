If I could meet me when I was 16,
I think the first thing that I would say
is that it is so tempting to do something
for somebody to get them to like you.
Don&#39;t.
Really be mindful that you are so wise right now
because of all the things that you don&#39;t know.
So just, really before somebody
asks you to do something,
really take time to think about
whether or not it&#39;s going to be good for you,
that if, after you do it, you&#39;re going to go,
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so glad I did that!
That was so good for me,
that was so wonderful.&quot;
You know, whether that&#39;s, whatever it is,
whether it&#39;s eating something,
drinking something,
being with somebody,
taking a job,
whatever it is,
just really check into the wisdom
that you already have
to see how you&#39;re going to feel after you to do it.
That&#39;s the first thing.
And the second thing,
I think there&#39;s loads,
but the second thing is jealousy.
Jealousy is a wonderful engine.
When you have it,
really, really take it in
and ask yourself,
&quot;Ooh, I&#39;m really jealous of so-and-so.
What is it I&#39;m jealous about?
What is it that they have that I want?&quot;
And then trust that you already have it
and act as if you do,
and if you don&#39;t,
if you really feel,
&quot;Ooh, I don&#39;t have that thing or that attribute,&quot;
then trust that somewhere you have some quality
that resembles that and let it grow in you.
