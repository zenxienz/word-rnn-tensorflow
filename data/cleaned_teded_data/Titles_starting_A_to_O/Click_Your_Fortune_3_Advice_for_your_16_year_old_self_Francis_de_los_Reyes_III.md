I would say to my 16-year-old self,
&quot;Just trust that it will work out.
I think, trust that if you keep doing what you&#39;re doing,
have the confidence that the future will be fine.&quot;
I think it&#39;s something
that most 16-year-olds of today need to hear
is that it&#39;s going to be okay,
just, you know, strive for excellence,
and try to do good,
and it&#39;s going to work out.
