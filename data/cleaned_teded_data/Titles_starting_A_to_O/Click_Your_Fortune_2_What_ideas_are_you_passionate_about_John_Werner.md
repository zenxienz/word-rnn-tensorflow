I love history,
and in K-12, you take history classes,
and a lot of kids are bored silly in them.
The history I learn is whenever I go someplace,
I want to know what happened each decade,
you know, for the last like 500 years before.
And I&#39;m passionate about trends,
and what does that information about the past
tell you about the future
and how I can be part of the future
and shape the future
and bring people together
to do innovative things.
So, I&#39;m passionate about knowing
where things have come from
and helping shape where they can go.
