I&#39;ve got a great idea it&#39;s gonna change
the world it&#39;s fantastic it&#39;s gonna blow
your mind it&#39;s my beautiful baby here&#39;s
the thing everybody loves a beautiful
baby I mean I was a beautiful baby
here&#39;s me and my dad a couple days after
I was born so in the world of product
design the beautiful babies like the
concept car it&#39;s it&#39;s the knockout you
know you see and you go oh my god I buy
that in a second so so why is it that
this year&#39;s new cars look pretty much
exactly like last year&#39;s new cars what
went wrong between the design studio in
the factory see today I don&#39;t want to
talk about beautiful babies I want to
talk about the awkward adolescence of
design those dorky teenage years where
you&#39;re trying to figure out how the
world works I&#39;m gonna start with an
example from some work that we did on
newborn health so here&#39;s the problem 4
million babies around the world mostly
in developing countries die every year
before their first birthday even before
their first month of life it turns out
half of those kids or about 1.8 million
newborns around the world wouldn&#39;t make
it if you could just keep them warm for
the first three days maybe the first
week so this is a newborn intensive care
unit and kathmandu-nepal all of these
kids and blankets belong in incubators
something like this so this is a donated
Japanese atom incubator that we found in
a NICU in Katmandu this is what we want
probably what happened as a hospital in
Japan upgraded their equipment and
donated their old stuff to to Nepal the
problem is without technicians without
spare parts donations like this very
quickly turn into junk so this seemed
like a problem that we could do
something about I mean keeping a baby
warm for a week that&#39;s not you know
that&#39;s not rocket science so we got
started we partnered with a leading
medical research institution here in
Boston we conducted months of user
research overseas trying to you know
think like designers human centered
design let&#39;s figure out
people want we killed thousands of
posted notes we made dozens of
prototypes to get to this so this is the
Neo nurture infant incubator and this
has a lot of smarts built into it and we
felt great so the idea here is unlike
the concept card we want to marry
something beautiful with something that
actually works and our idea is that this
design would inspire manufacturers and
other people of influence to sort of
take this model and run with it here&#39;s
the bad news
the only baby ever actually put inside
the neo nurture incubator was this kid
during a Time magazine photo shoot so
you know recognition is fantastic we
want design to get out you know for
people to see it at won lots of awards
but it felt like a booby prize I mean I
we wanted to make beautiful things that
are gonna make the world a better place
that are gonna make the world a better
place and I don&#39;t think this kid was
even in it long enough to get warm so so
it turns out that design for inspiration
it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t really I guess I
guess what I would say is it for us for
what I want to do it&#39;s either too slow
or it just doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s ineffective
so really I want to design for outcomes
I don&#39;t want to make beautiful stuff I
want to make the world a better place so
when we were designing neo nurture we
paid a lot of attention to the people
who are gonna use this thing for example
poor families rural doctors overloaded
nurses even repair technicians we
thought we had all our bases covered
we&#39;ve done everything right well it
turns out there&#39;s this whole
constellation of people who have to be
involved in a product for it to be
successful manufacturing financing
distribution regulation
Michael Free it passes you have to
figure out who will choose use and pay
the dues for a product like this and I
had that&#39;s a question you know VC&#39;s
always asked well sir what is your
business and who is your customer who is
our customer well here&#39;s an example this
is a Bangladeshi hospital director
outside his facility it turns out he
doesn&#39;t buy any of his equipment those
decisions are made by the Ministry of
Health or by foreign donors and it just
kind of shows up similarly here&#39;s a
multinational medical device
manufacturer turns out they got a fish
where the fish are
so it turns out that in emerging markets
where the fish are are sort of the
emerging middle class of these countries
diseases of affluence heart disease
infertility so turns out that design for
outcomes in one aspect really means
thinking about design for manufacture
and distribution okay that was an
important lesson second we took that
lesson and tried to push it into our
next project so we started by finding a
manufacturing organization called MTTs
in Vietnam that manufactures newborn
care technologies for Southeast Asia our
other partners east-meets-west this is
an American foundation that distributes
that technology to poor hospitals around
that region so we started with them
saying well what do you want what&#39;s a
problem you want to solve and they said
well let&#39;s work on newborn jaundice so
this is another one of these like
mind-boggling global problems so
jaundice affects two-thirds of newborns
around the world of those newborns one
in ten roughly if it&#39;s not treated the
jaundice gets so severe that it leads to
either lifelong disability or the kids
could even die there&#39;s one way to treat
jaundice and that&#39;s what&#39;s called an
exchange transfusion so as you can
imagine that&#39;s expensive and a little
bit dangerous
there is another cure it&#39;s it&#39;s very
technological it&#39;s very complex little
daunting you got a shine blue light on
the kid bright blue light on as much of
the skin as you can cover how is this a
hard problem so so you know I went to
MIT you know okay we&#39;ll figure that out
so here&#39;s an example this is an overhead
phototherapy device that&#39;s designed for
American hospitals and here&#39;s how it&#39;s
supposed to be used so it&#39;s over the
baby illuminating it a signal patient
take it out an American Hospital send it
overseas to a crowded facility an agent
here&#39;s how it&#39;s actually used the
effectiveness of photo therapy is a
function of light intensity so these
dark blue squares show you where it&#39;s
effective phototherapy here&#39;s what it
looks like under actual use so those
kids on the edges aren&#39;t actually
receiving effective phototherapy but
without training without some kind of
light meter how would you know we see
other examples of problems like this so
here&#39;s the neonatal intensive care unit
where moms come in to visit their babies
and keep in mind that mom maybe just had
a c-section okay so that&#39;s already kind
of a bummer mom is visiting her kid she
sees her baby naked lying under some
blue lights looking kind of vulnerable
it&#39;s not uncommon from mom to put a
blanket over the baby from a photo
therapy standpoint maybe not the best
behavior in fact that sounds kind of
dumb except what we&#39;ve learned is it
there&#39;s no such thing as a dumb user
really is what we&#39;ve learned there are
only dumb products we have to think like
existentialist it&#39;s not the painting we
would have painted it&#39;s the painting
that we actually paint it&#39;s it&#39;s the use
design for actual use how are people
actually going to use this so similarly
when we think about our partner MTTs
they&#39;ve made some amazing technologies
for treating newborn illnesses so here&#39;s
an overhead warmer and a CPAP they&#39;re
inexpensive really rugged they&#39;ve
treated 50 thousand kids in Vietnam with
this technology but here&#39;s the problem
every doctor in the world every hospital
administrator has seen TV you know curse
those whatever er re-runs
turns out they all know what a medical
device is supposed to look like they
want Buck Rogers they don&#39;t want
effective it sounds crazy it sounds dumb
but there are actually hospitals it
would rather have no equipment than
something that looks cheap and crummy so
again if we want people to trust the
device it has to look trustworthy so
thinking about outcomes turns out
appearances matter so we took all that
information together we tried this time
to get it right
and here&#39;s where we develop so this is
the Firefly phototherapy device except
this time we didn&#39;t stop at the concept
car so from the very beginning we
started by talking to manufacturers like
our goal is to make a state-of-the-art
product that our partner MTTs can
actually manufacture so our goal is to
study how they work the resources they
have access to so that they can make
this product so that&#39;s the design for
manufacture question when we think about
actual use you&#39;ll noticed a Firefly has
a single bassinet it only fits a single
baby and the idea here is it it&#39;s
obvious how you ought to use this device
if you try to put more than one kid and
you&#39;re kind of stacking them on top of
each other so the idea here is we say
you want to make it hard to use wrong in
other words you want to make the right
way to use it the easiest way to use it
another example it&#39;s again silly mom you
know silly Juana thinks her baby looks
cold wants to put a blanket over the
baby well that&#39;s why we have lights
above and below the baby and Firefly so
if mom does put a blanket over the baby
still receiving effective phototherapy
from below last story here I&#39;ve got a
friend in India who told me that you
haven&#39;t really tested a piece of
electronic technology for distribution
in in Asia until you&#39;ve trained a
cockroach to climb in and pee on every
single little component on the inside
it&#39;s you think it&#39;s funny I had a laptop
in the Peace Corps and the screen had
all these dead pixels on it and one day
I looked in they&#39;re all dead ants this
sort of gotten into my laptop and
perished those poor ants
so with Firefly what we did is the
problem is electronics get hot and you
have to put in vents or fans to keep
them cool in most products we decided
that okay I can&#39;t put a do not enter
sign next to the vent you know this kind
of thing we actually got rid of all that
stuff so Firefly is totally sealed these
are the kind of lessons I mean as
awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy
teenager much worse to be a frustrated
designer so thinking about okay what I
really want to do is change the world I
have to pay attention to manufacturing
and distribution I have to pay attention
how people are actually going to use a
device I actually have to pay attention
really there&#39;s no excuse for failure I
have to think like an existentialist I
have to accept that there are no dumb
users
there&#39;s only dumb products we have to
ask
hard questions are we designing for the
world that we want are we designing for
the world that we have we designing for
the world that&#39;s coming whether we&#39;re
ready or not I got into this business
designing products I&#39;ve since learned
that if you really want to make a
difference in the world you have to
design outcomes and that&#39;s design that
matters thank you
