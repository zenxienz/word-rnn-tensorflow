What&#39;s one interview question 
you ask every prospective employee?
I&#39;m fortunate that 
a bunch of my founding team
is still with me,
and we were friends off the bat
so we can be very comfortable 
with each other.
So, I&#39;d say the first question 
I ask is actually,
&quot;Tell me your story.&quot;
It may seem pretty simple,
but really what I&#39;m looking for
is creativity,
honesty,
and probably the most 
important characteristic
that no one ever talks about
is sense of humor.
If you can&#39;t roll with 
my existing team
and laugh at 
the same jokes as us
and get it done at 
the same pace as us,
then you can&#39;t 
contribute to the team,
and that would be 
horrible for you, you know?
You don&#39;t want to be
in an environment
where you don&#39;t really feel
like you&#39;re a part of the family.
So, I start from there.
What&#39;s your story?
Who are you?
