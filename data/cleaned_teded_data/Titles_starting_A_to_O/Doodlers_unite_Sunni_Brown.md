so I just want to tell you my story I
spend a lot of time teaching adults how
to use visual language and doodling in
the workplace and naturally I encounter
a lot of resistance right because it&#39;s
sort of considered to be anti
intellectual encounter to serious
learning but I have a problem with that
belief because I know that doodling has
a profound impact on the way that we can
process information and the way that we
can solve problems so I was curious
about why there was a disconnect between
the way that our society perceives
doodling and the way that the reality is
so I discovered some very interesting
things for example there is no such
thing as a flattering definition of a
doodle in the 17th century a doodle was
a simpleton or a fool as in Yankee
Doodle in the 18th century it became a
verb and it meant to swindle or ridicule
or to make fun of someone in the 19th
century it was a corrupt politician and
today we have what is perhaps our most
offensive definition at least to me
which is the following to doodle
officially means to dawdle to
dilly-dally to monkey around to make
meaningless marks to do something of
little value substance or import and my
personal favorite to do nothing no
wonder people are averse to dueling at
work doing nothing at work is akin to
masturbating at work it&#39;s totally
inappropriate additionally I&#39;ve heard
horror stories from people whose
teachers scolded them of course for
doodling in classrooms and they have
bosses who scold them for doodling in
the boardroom
there is a powerful cultural norm
against doodling in settings in which we
are supposed to learn something and
unfortunately the press tends to
reinforce this norm when they&#39;re
reporting on a doodling scene you know
of an important person at a confirmation
hearing and the like they typically use
words like discovered or caught or found
out as if there&#39;s some sort of criminal
act being committed and additionally
there is a psychological aversion to
doodling Thank You Freud in the 1930s
Freud told us all that you could analyze
people&#39;s psyches based on their doodles
this is not accurate but it did happen
to Tony Blair at the Davos forum in 2005
five when his doodles were of course
discovered and he was labeled the
following things now it turned out to be
Bill Gates&#39;s doodle and bill if you&#39;re
here nobody thinks you&#39;re megalomaniacal
but that does contribute right to people
not wanting to share their doodles and
here is the real deal here&#39;s what I
believe I think that our culture is so
intensely focused on verbal information
that we&#39;re almost blinded to the value
of doodling and I&#39;m not comfortable with
that
and so because of that belief that I
think needs to be burst I&#39;m here to send
us all hurtling back to the truth and
here&#39;s the truth doodling is an
incredibly powerful tool and it is a
tool that we need to remember and to
relearn so here&#39;s a new definition for
doodling and I hope there&#39;s someone in
here from the Oxford English Dictionary
because I want to talk to you later
here&#39;s the real definition doodling is
really to make spontaneous marks to help
yourself think that is why millions of
people doodle here&#39;s another interesting
truth about the doodle people who doodle
when they&#39;re exposed to verbal
information retain more of that
information than their non doodling
counterparts we think doodling is
something you do when you lose focus but
in reality it is a pre-emptive measure
to stop you from losing focus
additionally it has a profound effect on
creative problem-solving and deep
information processing there are four
ways that learner&#39;s intake information
so that they can make decisions they are
visual auditory reading and writing and
kinesthetic now in order for us to
really chew on information and do
something with it we have to engage at
least two of those modalities or we have
to engage one of those modalities
coupled with an emotional experience the
incredible contribution of the doodle is
that it engages all four learning
modalities simultaneously with the
possibility of an emotional experience
that is a pretty solid contribution for
behavior equated with doing nothing this
is so nerdy but this made me cry when I
discovered this so they did
anthropological research into the
unfolding of artistic activity in
children and they found that across
space and time all children exhibit the
same evolution
and visual logic as they grow in other
words they have a shared and growing
complexity and visual language that
happens in a predictable order and I
think that is incredible I think that
means doodling is native to us and we
simply are denying ourselves that
instinct and finally a lot of people
aren&#39;t privy to this but the doodle is a
precursor to some of our greatest
cultural assets this is but one this is
Frank Gehry the architects precursor to
the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi so here is
my point under no circumstances should
doodling be eradicated from a classroom
or a boardroom or even the war room on
the contrary dueling should be leveraged
in precisely those situations where
information density is very high and the
need for processing that information is
very high and I will go you one further
because doodling is so universally
accessible and it is not intimidating as
an art form it can be leveraged as a
portal through which we move people into
higher levels of visual literacy my
friends the doodle has never been the
Nemesis of intellectual thought in
reality it is one of its greatest allies
thank you
