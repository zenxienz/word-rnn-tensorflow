It really makes a difference what we say.
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz.
She went to Auschwitz when she was fifteen years old,
and her brother was eight, and the parents were lost.
And she told me this,
&quot;We were in the train going to Auschwitz,
and I looked down, and I saw 
my brother&#39;s shoes were missing.
And I said, &#39;Why are you so stupid?
Can&#39;t you keep your things together?
For goodness sake!&#39;
The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.&quot;
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him
because she never saw him again.
He did not survive.
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.
She said, &quot;I walked out of Auschwitz into life.
And the vow was,
&quot;I will never say anything that couldn&#39;t stand
as the last thing I ever say.&quot;
Now, can we do that? No.
But it is a possibility to live in to.
Thank you.
