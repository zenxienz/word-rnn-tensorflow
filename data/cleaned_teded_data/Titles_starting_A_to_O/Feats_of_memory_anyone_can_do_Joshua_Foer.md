I&#39;d like to invite you to close your
eyes imagine yourself standing outside
the front door of your home I&#39;d like you
to notice the color of the door the
material that it&#39;s made out of now
visualize a pack of overweight nudists
on bicycles they are competing in a
naked bicycle race and they are headed
straight for your front door I need you
to actually see this they are pedaling
really hard they&#39;re sweaty they&#39;re
bouncing around a lot and they crash
straight into the front door of your
home bicycles fly everywhere wheels roll
past you spokes end up in awkward places
step over the threshold of your door
into your foyer your hallway whatever&#39;s
on the other side and appreciate the
quality of the light the light is
shining down on Cookie Monster Cookie
Monster is waving at you from his perch
on top of a tan horse it&#39;s a talking
horse you can practically feel his blue
fur tickling your nose you can smell the
oatmeal raisin cookie that he&#39;s about to
shovel into his mouth walk past him walk
past him into your living room in your
living room in full imaginative
broadband picture Britney Spears
she is scantily clad she&#39;s dancing on
your coffee table and he&#39;s singing hit
me baby one more time and then follow me
into your kitchen in your kitchen the
floor has been paved over with a yellow
brick road and out of your oven are
coming towards you Dorothy the Tin Man
the Scarecrow and the lion from The
Wizard of Oz
hand-in-hand skipping straight towards
you okay open your eyes
I want to tell you about a very bizarre
contest that is held every spring in New
York City it&#39;s called the United States
memory championship and I had gone to
cover this contest a few years back as a
science journalist expecting I guess
that this was going to be like the Super
Bowl of savants this was a bunch of guys
in a few ladies widely varying in both
age and hygienic upkeep
they were memorizing hundreds of random
numbers looking at them just once they
were memorizing the names of dozens and
dozens and dozens of strangers they were
memorizing entire poems in just a few
minutes they were competing to see who
could memorize the order of a shuffled
pack of playing cards fastest and I was
like this is unbelievable these people
must be freaks of nature and I started
talking to a few of the competitors this
is a guy called Edie cook who had come
over from England where he had one of
the best-trained memories and I said to
him
Edie when did you realize that you were
a savant and it was like I&#39;m not a
savant in fact I have just an average
memory everybody who competes in this
contest will tell you that they have
just an average memory we&#39;ve all trained
ourselves to perform these utterly
miraculous feats of memory using a set
of ancient techniques techniques
invented 2,500 years ago in Greece the
same techniques that cicero had used to
memorize his speeches that medieval
scholars had used to memorize entire
books as i whoa how come I never heard
this before and we were standing outside
the competition hall and Edie who is a
wonderful brilliant but somewhat
eccentric English guy says to me Josh
you&#39;re an American journalist
do you know Britney Spears I&#39;m like what
no why because I really
to teach Britney Spears how to memorize
the order of a shuffled pack of playing
cards on u.s. national television it
will prove to the world that anybody can
do this as well
I&#39;m not Britney Spears but maybe you
could teach me I mean you got to start
somewhere right and that was the
beginning of a very strange journey for
me I ended up spending the better part
of the next year not only training my
memory but also investigating it trying
to understand how it works why it
sometimes doesn&#39;t work and what its
potential might be and I met a host of
really interesting people this is a guy
called EP he&#39;s an amnesiac who had very
possibly the worst memory in the world
his memory was so bad that he didn&#39;t
even remember he had a memory problem
which is amazing and he was this
incredibly tragic figure but he was a
window into the extent to which our
memories make us who we are the other
end of the spectrum I met this guy this
is Kim peek he was the bassist for
Dustin Hoffman&#39;s character in the movie
Rain Man we spent an afternoon together
in the Salt Lake City Public Library
memorizing phone books which was
scintillating
and I went back and I read a whole host
of memory treatises treatises written
2,000 plus years ago in Latin in
antiquity and then later in the Middle
Ages and I learned a whole bunch of
really interesting stuff one of the
really interesting things that I learned
is that once upon a time this idea of
having a trained disciplined cultivated
memory was not nearly so alien as it
would seem to us to be today once upon a
time people invested in their memories
in laborious ly furnishing their minds
over the last few millennia we&#39;ve
invented a series of technologies from
the alphabet to the scroll the Codex the
printing press photography the computer
the smartphone that have made it
progressively easier and easier for us
to externalize our memories for us to
essentially outsource this fundamental
human capacity these technologies have
made our modern world possible but
they&#39;ve also changed us they&#39;ve changed
us culturally and I would argue that
they&#39;ve changed us cognitively having
little need to remember anymore it
sometimes seems like we&#39;ve forgotten how
one of the last places on earth where
you still find people passionate about
this idea of a trained disciplined
cultivated memory is that this totally
singular memory contest it&#39;s actually
not that singular their contests held
all over the world and I was fascinated
I wanted to know how do these guys do it
few years back a group of researchers at
University College London brought a
bunch of memory champions into the lab
they wanted to know do these guys have
brains that are somehow structurally
anatomically different from the rest of
ours the answer was no are they smarter
than the rest of us they gave him a
bunch of cognitive testing the answer
was not really there was however one
really interesting and telling
difference between the brains of the
memory champions and the control
subjects that they were comparing the
- when they put these guys in an fMRI
machine scanned their brains while they
were memorizing numbers and people&#39;s
faces and pictures of snowflakes they
found that the memory champions were
lighting up different parts of the brain
than everyone else of note they were
using or they seemed to be using a part
of the brain that&#39;s involved in spatial
memory and navigation why and is there
something that the rest of us can learn
from this the sport of competitive
memorizing is driven by a kind of arms
race where every year somebody comes up
with a new way to remember more stuff
more quickly and then the rest of the
field has to play catch-up this is my
friend Ben prid Moore three-time world
memory champion on his desk in front of
him are 36 shuffled packs of playing
cards that he is about to try to
memorize in one hour using a technique
that he invented and he alone has
mastered he used a similar technique to
memorize the precise order of 4140
random binary digits in half an hour
yeah and while there are a whole host of
ways of remembering stuff in these
competitions everything all of the
techniques that are being used
ultimately come down to a concept that
psychologists refer to as elaborative
encoding and it&#39;s well illustrated by a
nifty paradox known as the Baker Baker
paradox which goes like this if I tell
two people to remember the same word if
I say to you remember that there is a
guy named Baker that&#39;s his name and I
say to you remember that there is a guy
who is a baker okay and I come back to
you at some point later on and I say do
you remember that word that I told you a
while back to you remember what it was
the person who was told his name is a
baker is less likely to remember the
same word and the person who was told
his job is that he is a baker
same word different amount of
remembering that&#39;s weird what&#39;s going on
here well the name Baker doesn&#39;t
actually mean anything to you it is
entirely untethered from all of the
other memories floating around in your
skull but the common noun Baker we know
Baker&#39;s Baker&#39;s were funny white hats
Baker&#39;s have flour on their hands
Baker&#39;s smell good when they come home
from work maybe we even know a baker and
when we first hear that word we start
putting these associational hooks into
it that make it easier to fish it back
out at some later date the entire art of
what is going on in these memory
contests and the entire art of
remembering stuff better in everyday
life is figuring out ways to transform
capital B bakers into lowercase D
Baker&#39;s to take information that is
lacking in context in significance in
meaning and transform it in some way so
that it becomes meaningful in the light
of all of the other things that you have
in your mind one of the more elaborate
techniques for doing this dates back
2500 years to ancient Greece came to be
known as the memory palace the story
behind its creation goes like this there
was a poet called saman ADIZ who was
attending a banquet he was actually the
hired entertainment because back then he
want to throw a really slammin party you
didn&#39;t hire a DJ you hired a poet and he
stands up delivers his poem from memory
walks out the door and at the moment he
does the banquet hall collapses kills
everybody inside doesn&#39;t just kill
everybody
it mangles the bodies beyond all
recognition nobody can say who was
inside nobody can say where they were
sitting the bodies can&#39;t be properly
buried it&#39;s one tragedy compounding
another Syme on of these standing
outside the sole survivor amid the
wreckage closes his eyes and has this
realization which is that in his mind&#39;s
eye he can see
each of the guests at the banquet had
been sitting and he takes the relatives
by the hand and guides them each to
their loved ones amid the wreckage what
sigh monetise figured out at that moment
is something that I think we all kind of
intuitively know which is that as bad as
we are at remembering names and phone
numbers and word-for-word instructions
from our colleagues we have really
exceptional visual and spatial memories
if I asked you to recount the first 10
words of the story that I just told you
about Samana these chances are you would
have a tough time with it
but I would wager that if I asked you to
recall who is sitting on top of a
talking tan horse in your foyer right
now you would be able to see that the
idea behind the memory palace is to
create this imagined edifice in your
mind&#39;s eye and populate it with images
of the things that you want to remember
the crazier weirder more bizarre funnier
raunchy er stinkier the images the more
unforgettable it&#39;s likely to be this is
advice that goes back 2,000 plus years
to the earliest latin memory treatises
so how does this work let&#39;s say that
you&#39;ve been invited to Ted the center
stage to give a speech and you want to
do it from memory and you want to do it
the way that Cicero would have done it
if he had been invited to TEDx Rome
2,000 years ago what you might do is
picture yourself at the front door of
your house and you&#39;d come up with some
sort of an absolutely crazy ridiculous
unforgettable image to remind you that
the first thing you want to talk about
is this totally bizarre contest and then
you go inside your house and you would
see an image of Cookie Monster on top of
mr. Edie and that would remind you that
you want to then introduce your friend
ed cook and then you&#39;d see an image of
Britney Spears to remind you of the
funny anecdote you want to tell and you
go into your kitchen and the fourth
topic you were going to talk about was
this strange journey that you went on
for a year and you&#39;d have some friends
to help you remember that this is how
Roman orders memorize their speeches not
word for word which is just going to
screw you up
but topic for topic in fact the phrase
topic sentence that comes from the Greek
word topos which means place that&#39;s a
vestige of when people used to think
about oratory and rhetoric in these
sorts of spatial terms the phrase in the
first place that&#39;s like in the first
place of your memory palace I thought
this was just fascinating and I got
really into it and I went to a few more
of these memory contests and I had this
notion that I might write something
longer about this subculture of
competitive memorizers but there was a
problem the problem was that a memory
contest is a pathologically boring event
truly it is like a bunch of people
sitting around taking the SATs I mean
the most dramatic it gets is when
somebody starts massaging their temples
and I&#39;m a journalist I need something to
write about you know I know that there&#39;s
this incredible stuff happening in these
people&#39;s minds but I don&#39;t have access
to it and I realized if I was going to
tell this story I needed to walk in
their shoes a little bit and so I
started trying to spend fifteen or
twenty minutes every morning before I
sat down with my New York Times just
trying to remember something it was a
poem maybe it was names from an old
yearbook that I bought at a flea market
and I found that this was shockingly fun
I never would have expected that it was
fun because this is actually not about
training your memory what you&#39;re doing
is you&#39;re trying to get better and
better and better at creating a dreaming
up these utterly ludicrous raunchy
hilarious and hopefully unforgettable
images in your mind&#39;s eye and I got
pretty into it this is me wearing my
standard competitive memorizers training
kit it&#39;s a pair of earmuffs and a set of
safety goggles that have been masked
over except for two small pin holes
because distraction is the competitive
memorizers greatest enemy I ended up
coming back to that same contest as I
had covered a year earlier I had this
notion that I might enter it sort of is
an experiment in participatory
journalism it&#39;d make I thought maybe a
nice epilogue to all my research problem
was the experiment went haywire I won
the contest which Richard which really
wasn&#39;t supposed to happen
now it is nice to be able to memorize
speeches and phone numbers and shopping
lists but it&#39;s actually kind of beside
the point these are just tricks they are
tricks that work because they are based
on some pretty basic principles about
how our brains work and you don&#39;t have
to be building memory palaces or
memorizing packs of playing cards to
benefit from a little bit of insight
about how your mind works we often talk
about people with great memories as
though it were some sort of an innate
gift but that is not the case great
memories are learned at the most basic
level we remember when we pay attention
we remember when we are deeply engaged
we remember when we were able to take a
piece of information and experience and
figure out why it is meaningful to us
why it is significant why it&#39;s colorful
when we&#39;re able to transform it in some
way that it makes sense in the light of
all of the other things floating around
in our minds when we&#39;re able to
transform bakers into Baker&#39;s the memory
palace these memory techniques
they&#39;re just shortcuts in fact they&#39;re
not even really shortcuts they work
because they make you work they force a
kind of depth of processing a kind of
mindfulness that most of us don&#39;t
normally walk around exercising but
there actually are no shortcuts this is
how stuff is made memorable and I think
if there&#39;s one thing that I want to
leave you with its what EP the amnesiac
who couldn&#39;t even remember that he had a
memory problem left me with which is the
notion that our lives are the sum of our
memories how much are we willing to lose
from our already short lives by losing
ourselves in our blackberries or iPhones
by not paying attention to the human
being across from us who is talking with
by being so lazy that we&#39;re not willing
to process deeply I learned firsthand
that there are incredible memory
capacities latent in all of us but if
you want to live a memorable life you
have to be the kind of person who
remembers to remember thank you
