I don&#39;t know about you, but
I&#39;m trying to get this beach body,
that P90X,
Brad Pitt,
Bradley Cooper,
Tyrese,
Trey Songz,
Matthew McConaughey
beach body!
I&#39;m trying to sweat in front of everybody.
Word.
And get that shorty with them Angelina Jolie lips
to lick my torso,
get me looking like a wet chocolate.
Look at my biceps.
They&#39;re kind of puny.
They&#39;re kind of chunky.
But I&#39;ve been working on them.
We can be models.
I could take off my shirt mad sexy.
I could stare at a camera intensely
for 37 seconds straight and not blink.
I could bathe in baby oil.
I could run on the beach in slow motion.
I could cat walk down a runway in zebra panties.
I can&#39;t do that.
Having a slow metabolism ruins everything.
All my friends will be in tank tops,
and I&#39;ll be in a hoodie.
I&#39;m good at zipping up my insecurities,
thinking I could sweat them out.
I&#39;m trying to get this beach body!
I&#39;m too skinny.
I guzzle junk food like my mouth&#39;s a garbage chute,
but my intestines are allergic to trans fat.
I want to be a flexing horse leg,
galloping beach sand into a red carpet,
customized for me
to strut the shore side
like a centaur on a conveyor belt.
I&#39;m trying to get this beach body,
but there is salvation in snack closets,
on licked plates of seconds,
at the bottom of a pint of ice cream.
I use Haagen Dazs as a morphine cylinder
because she said my arms weren&#39;t strong enough to carry her.
I think I&#39;m weak.
I think I&#39;m fat.
I think I&#39;m ugly.
The beach is no place for a whale like me,
for a mini van with its tank on E.
I want to be Baywatch bareable,
broken, bottle-cut, have you seen my muscles
and my scars?
You smell that?
That&#39;s macho moisture.
My hour-long work out routine consists of
5 minutes of push-ups on my bedroom floor,
a denial mirror repelling my lanky limbs;
5 minutes of keeping my chin high over the bar of self doubt;
10 minutes placing 100 pounds of failure on my chest
so it becomes the elephant in the room;
10 minutes jogging with ghosts
chuckling at my chunky thighs,
and I&#39;ll smile,
knowing I&#39;ll soon be able to fit in my old butt pants;
30 minutes thinking sweat is a masculinity cloak.
And I&#39;m weary from trying to work out my irrational fears,
drown them in a puddle of perspiration,

shove the imperfections I should be proud of under water:
my gap-tooth smile,
my frizzy hair,
my funny shaped head,
the extra weight that kept me grounded,
the missing pounds that make me
a kite flailing free through the wind,
not bound by muscle.
So, yes,
I&#39;m trying to get this beach body,
that Channing Tatum,
David Beckham,
LL Cool J
beach body!
But we&#39;re tired
and exhausted
from trying to be something we&#39;re not.
