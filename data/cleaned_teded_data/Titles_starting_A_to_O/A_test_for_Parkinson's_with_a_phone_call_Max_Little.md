so well I do applied math and this is a
peculiar problem for anyone who does
applied math is that we are like
management consultants no one knows what
the hell we do so I&#39;m going to give you
some attempt today to try and explain to
you what I do so dancing is one of the
most human of activities we delight at
ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you&#39;ll
see later on it now ballet requires an
extraordinary level of expertise and a
high level of skill and probably a level
of initial suitability that may well
have a genetic component to it now sadly
neurological disorders such as
Parkinson&#39;s disease gradually destroy
this extraordinary ability as it is
doing to my friend yam stripling who was
a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time so
great progress and treatment has been
made over the years however there are
six point three million people worldwide
who have the disease and they have to
live with incurable weakness tremor
rigidity any other symptoms that go
along with the disease so what we need
our objective tools to detect the
disease before it&#39;s too late we need to
be able to measure progression
objectively and ultimately with only way
we&#39;re going to know when we actually
have a cure is when we have an objective
measure that can answer that for sure
but frustratingly with Parkinson&#39;s
disease and other movement disorders
there are no biomarkers there&#39;s no
simple blood tests that you can do and
the best that we have is like this
20-minute neurologist test you have to
go to the clinic to do it it&#39;s very very
costly and that means they&#39;re outside
the clinical trials it&#39;s just never done
it&#39;s never done but what if patients
could do this test at home now that
would actually save on a difficult trip
to clinic and what if patients could do
that test themselves right no expensive
staff time required it takes about three
hundred dollars right away in the
neurologist clearly to do it so what I
want to propose to you as an
unconventional way in which we can try
to achieve this because you see in one
sense at least we are all virtuosos like
my friend yam stripling so here we have
a video at the vibrating vocal folds now
this is healthy and this is somebody
making speech sounds and we can think of
ourselves as vocal ballet dancers
because we have to coordinate
all of these vocal organs when we make
sounds and we all actually have the
genes for it fox p2 for example and like
ballet it takes an extraordinary level
of training I mean just think how long
it takes a child&#39;s learn to speak and
from the sound we can actually track the
vocal fold position as it vibrates and
just as the limbs are affected in
Parkinson&#39;s so to our vocal organs so in
the bottom trace you can see example of
a regular vocal fold tremor we see all
the same symptoms we see vocal tremor
weakness and rigidity the speech
actually becomes quieter and more breath
Lee after a while and that&#39;s one of the
example symptoms of it so these vocal
effects can actually be quite subtle in
some cases but with any digital
microphone and using precision voice
analysis software in combination with
the latest in machine learning which is
very advanced by now we can now quantify
exactly where somebody lies on the
continuum between health and disease
using voice signals alone so these voice
based tests how do they stack up against
expert clinical tests well they&#39;re both
non-invasive the neurologist test is
non-invasive they&#39;re both use existing
infrastructure don&#39;t have to design a
whole new set of hospitals to do it and
I both accurate okay but in addition
void space tests are non-expert that
means they can be self-administered
their high-speed take about 30 seconds
at most their ultra low-cost and we all
know that happens when something becomes
ultra low-cost it becomes massively
scalable and so here are some amazing
goals that I think we can deal with now
we can reduce logistical difficulties
for patients no need to go to the clinic
for a routine checkup we can do high
frequency monitoring to get objective
data we can perform low-cost mass
recruitment for clinical trials and we
can make population scale screening
feasible for the first time we will have
the opportunity to start to search for
the early biomarkers of disease before
it&#39;s too late so taking the first steps
to all this today we&#39;re launching the
Parkinson&#39;s voice initiative with a key
lab and patients like me we&#39;re aiming to
record a very large number of voices
worldwide to collect enough data to
start to tackle these four goals we have
local numbers accessible to three
quarters of a billion people on the
planet anyone healthy oil Parkinson&#39;s
can call in and cheaply and leave
recordings a few cents each and I&#39;m
really happy to announce that we&#39;ve
already hit six percent of our target
just in eight hours
thank you
sonax by taking all these samples of
let&#39;s say 10,000 people yeah will you
you&#39;ll be able to tell who&#39;s healthy and
who&#39;s not what were you going to get out
of those things so what will happen is
that during a call you have to indicate
whether or not you have the disease or
not right you see some people may not do
it they may not get through it but will
get a very large sample of data that is
collected from all different
circumstances and it&#39;s getting it in
different circumstances that matter
because then we are looking at ironing
out the confounding factors and looking
for the actual markers of is easy so
you&#39;re eighty-six percent accurate right
now it&#39;s much better than that actually
my student thanassis I have to plug him
because he&#39;s done some fantastic work
and now he has proved that it works of a
mobile telephone network as well which
is enables this project and we&#39;re
getting 99 percent accuracy 99 well
that&#39;s an improvement so so what that
means is people be able to people be
able to call in from their mobile phones
and do this test yeah and people with
Parkinson&#39;s could call in record their
voice and then their doctor can check up
on their progress see where they&#39;re
doing in this course the disease
absolutely thanks so much max little
everybody thanks
you
