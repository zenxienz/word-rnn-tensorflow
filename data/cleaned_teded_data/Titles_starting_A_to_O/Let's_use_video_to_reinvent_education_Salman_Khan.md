Khan Academy is most known for its its
collection of videos so before I go any
farther let me show you a little bit of
a montage so the hypotenuse is now going
to be 5 this animals fossils are only
found in this area of South America a
nice clean band here and this part of
Africa we could integrate over the
surface and the notation usually is a
capital Sigma National Assembly they
create the Committee of Public Safety
which sounds like a very nice committee
notice this is an aldehyde and it&#39;s an
alcohol start differentiating into
effector and memory cells a galaxy hey
there&#39;s another galaxy oh look there&#39;s
another galaxy and $4 is there 30
million plus the 20 million dollars from
the American manufacturer if this does
not blow your mind then you have no
emotion
we now have on the order of 2,200 videos
covering everything from basic
arithmetic all the way to vector
calculus and some of the stuff that you
saw up there we have a million students
a month using the site watching on the
order of a hundred to two hundred
thousand videos a day but we&#39;re going to
talk about and this is how we&#39;re going
to the next level but before I do that I
want to talk a little bit about really
just how I got started and some of y&#39;all
might know about five years ago I was an
analyst at a hedge fund and I was in
Boston and I was tutoring my cousin&#39;s in
New Orleans remotely and I started
putting the first YouTube videos up
really just as kind of a nice to have
just kind of a supplement for my cousin
something that might you know give them
a refresher or something and as soon as
I put those first YouTube videos up
something interesting happen or actually
a bunch of interesting things happen the
first was the feedback from my cousin&#39;s
they told me that they preferred me on
youtube than in person and and what&#39;s
once you get over the backhanded nature
of that there was actually something
very profound there they were saying
that they preferred the automated
version of their cousin to their cousin
at first it&#39;s very unintuitive but when
you actually think about from their
point of view it makes a ton of sense
you have this situation where now they
can pause and repeat their cousin now
they can without feeling like they&#39;re
wasting my time they could if they have
to review something that they should
have learned a couple of weeks ago or
maybe a couple of years ago they don&#39;t
have to be embarrassed and ask their
cousin they can just watch those videos
if they&#39;re bored they can go ahead they
can watch it at their own time at their
own pace and probably the the least
appreciated
I guess aspect of this is the notion
that the very first time the very first
time that you&#39;re trying to get your
brain around a new concept the very last
thing you need is another human being
saying do you understand this and that&#39;s
what was happening with the interaction
with my cousin&#39;s before and now they
could just do it kind of in kind of
in the intimacy of their of their of
their own room the other thing that
happened is you know I put them on
YouTube just just you know for the you
guys I saw no reason to make it private
so I I let other people watch it and
then people started stumbling on it and
and I started getting some comments and
some letters and and all sorts of kind
of feedback from from random people
around the world and you know these are
just a few this is actually from one of
the original calculus videos and someone
wrote just on YouTube it was a youtube
comment first time I smiled doing a
derivative and let&#39;s pause here this
person did a derivative and then they
smiled and then in response to that same
comment this is on the thread you could
go on YouTube and look at these comments
someone else wrote same thing here I
actually got a natural high and a good
mood for the entire day since I remember
seeing all of this matrix text in class
and here I&#39;m all like I know kung fu see
and we got a lot of feedback along those
lines you know it&#39;s clearly was helping
people but then as the viewership kept
growing and kept growing I started
getting letters from from people and it
was starting to become clear that it was
actually more than just a nice to have
that this is just an excerpt from one of
one of those letters Mike
twelve-year-old son has autism and has
had a terrible time with math we have
tried everything
viewed everything bought everything we
stumbled on your video done decimals and
it got through then we went on to the
dreaded fractions again he got it we
could not believe it he is so excited
and so you can imagine you know here I
was a an analyst at a hedge Fonda I it
was very strange for me to do something
of social value cuz I was a
but uh I I was excited so I kept going
and then a few things other things
started to dawn on me that not only
would it help my cousin&#39;s right now or
these people who are sending letters but
it could may be that this content will
never go old that it could help their
kids or their grandkids if Isaac Newton
had done YouTube videos on calculus I
wouldn&#39;t have to sue sue assuming he was
good we don&#39;t know the other thing that
happened you know even at this point you
know I said okay maybe it&#39;s a good
supplement is good for motivated
students it&#39;s good for maybe home
schoolers but I didn&#39;t think it would be
something that would somehow penetrate
the classroom and then I start getting
letters from teachers and the teachers
would write saying we&#39;ve used your
videos to flip the classroom you&#39;ve
given the lectures so now what we do and
this could actually happen in every
classroom in America tomorrow what I do
is I assign the lectures for homework
and what used to be homework I now have
the students doing in the classroom and
I want to I want to pause here for I
want to pause here for a second because
there&#39;s a couple of interesting things
one when those when those teachers are
doing that there&#39;s there&#39;s the obvious
benefit there&#39;s the benefit that now
they&#39;re their students can enjoy the
videos in the way that my cousin&#39;s did
they can pause repeat at their own pace
at their own time but the more
interesting thing this is the
unintuitive thing when you talk about
technology in the classroom by removing
the one size fits all lecture from the
classroom and letting and letting
students have a self-paced lecture at
home and then when you go to the
classroom letting them do work having
the teacher walk around having the peers
actually be able to interact with each
other these teachers have used
technology to humanize the classroom
they took a fundamentally dehumanizing
experience a bunch of thirty kids with
their fingers on their lips not allowed
to interact with each other a teacher no
matter how good has to give this kind of
one size fits all lecture to thirty
students you know blank faces slightly
antagonistic and now it&#39;s a human
experience now they&#39;re actually
interacting with each other so once the
Khan Academy kind of you know I quit my
job
and we turn into a real organization
we&#39;re not-for-profit the question is how
do we take this to the next level how do
we take what those teachers were doing
to their natural conclusion and so what
I&#39;m showing over here these are actual
exercises that I started writing for my
cousin&#39;s the ones I started were much
more primitive this is a kind of a more
competent version of it but the paradigm
here is well we&#39;ll generate as many
questions as you need until you get that
concept until you get ten in a row and
the the Kahn Academy videos are there
you get hints the actual steps for that
problem if you don&#39;t know how to do it
but the parrot I mean it seems like a
very simple thing ten in a row you move
on but it&#39;s fundamentally different than
what&#39;s happening in classrooms right
right now and in a traditional classroom
you have a couple of a homework homework
lecture homework lecture and you have a
snapshot exam and that exam whether you
get a 70% at 80% of 90 percent or 95
percent the class moves on to the next
topic and even that 95 percent student
what was the 5% they didn&#39;t know maybe
they didn&#39;t know what what happens when
you raise something to the to the zeroth
power and then you go build on that in
the next concept that&#39;s analogous to
imagine learning to ride a bicycle and I
give you a bicycle maybe I&#39;ll give you a
lecture ahead of time and and I give you
that that bicycle for two weeks and then
I come back after two weeks and I say
well let&#39;s see you&#39;re having trouble
taking left turns you can&#39;t quite stop
your your an 80% bicyclist so I put a
big C stamp on your forehead and then I
say here&#39;s your unicycle but as
ridiculous as that sounds that&#39;s exactly
what&#39;s happening in our in our
classrooms right now and and and the
idea is you know you fast forward and
students start good students start
failing algebra all of a sudden and
start failing calculus all of a sudden
despite it being smart despite having
good teachers and it&#39;s usually because
they had these Swiss cheese gaps that
kept building throughout their
foundation so our model is learn math
the way you would learn anything like
the way you would learn a bicycle stay
on that bicycle fall off that bicycle do
it as long as necessary until you have
mastery the traditional model it
penalizes you for experimentation and
failure but it does not expect mastery
we encourage you to experiment we
encourage you to failure but we do
expect mastery
this is just one another one of the
modules this is trigonometry this is
shifting and reflecting functions and
they all fit together we have we have
about 90 of these right now and you
could go to the side right now it&#39;s all
freeing up not trying to sell anything
but the general idea is that they all
fit into this knowledge map that top
node right there that&#39;s literally
single-digit addition it&#39;s like one plus
one is equal to two and the paradigm is
once you get ten in a row on that and it
keeps forward you to more and more
advanced modules so if you keep so it
keep this is go down the knowledge map
we&#39;re getting into more advanced
arithmetic further down you start
getting into pre-algebra and early
algebra further down you start getting
into a verbal one algebra to a little
bit of precalculus and the idea is from
this we can actually teach everything
well everything that can be taught in
this type of a framework so you can
imagine and this is what we are working
on it&#39;s from this knowledge map you have
logic you have computer programming you
have grammar you have genetics all based
off of that core of okay if you know
this and that now you&#39;re ready for this
next concept now that can work well for
an individual learner you know and then
I encourage one for you to do with your
kids but I also encourage everyone in
the audience to do it yourself it&#39;ll
it&#39;ll change what happens at the dinner
table but what we want to do is use the
natural conclusion of the flipping of
the classroom that those early teachers
had emailed me about and so what I&#39;m
showing you here this is actually data
from a pilot in the Los Altos School
District where they took two fifth grade
classes and two seventh grade classes
and completely gutted their old math
curriculum these kids aren&#39;t using
textbooks they&#39;re not getting
one-size-fits-all lectures
they&#39;re doing Khan Academy they&#39;re doing
that software for roughly half of their
math class and I want to make it clear
we don&#39;t view this as the complete math
education what it does is and this is
what&#39;s happening in Los Altos it frees
up time this is the blocking and
tackling making sure you know how to do
the system of equation and it frees up
time for the simulations for the games
for the mechanics for the for the robot
building for the estimating how high
that hill is based on its on its shadow
and so the paradigm is the teacher walks
in every day
every kid works at their own pace and a
teacher get this is actually a live
dashboard from Los Altos School District
and they look at this dashboard every
row is a student every column is one of
those concepts Green
the students already proficient blue
means that they&#39;re working on it no need
to worry red means they&#39;re stuck and
what the teacher does is literally just
says let me intervene on the red kids or
even better let me get one of the green
kids who are already proficient in that
concept to be the first line of attack
and actually tutor their act their peer
now
I kind of come from a very data-centric
reality so we don&#39;t want that teacher to
even go and intervene and have to ask
the kid awkward questions Oh what do you
not understand what do you do understand
in all of the rest
so our paradigm is to really arm the
teachers with as much data as possible
really data that in almost any other
field is expected if you&#39;re in finance
or marketing or manufacturing and so the
teachers can actually diagnose what&#39;s
wrong with the students so that they can
make their interaction as productive as
possible so now the teachers know
exactly what the students been up to how
long they&#39;ve been spending every day
what videos have they been watching when
did they pause the videos what did they
stop watching what exercises are they
using what have they been focused on the
outer circle shows what the exercises
they&#39;re focused on the inner circle
shows the videos they&#39;re focused on and
the data gets pretty granular so you can
actually see the exact problems that the
student got right or wrong red is wrong
blue is right the leftmost question is
the first question that the student
attempted they watch the video right
over there and then you could see
eventually they were able to get ten in
a row it&#39;s almost like you can almost
see them learning over those last ten
problems they also got faster the height
is how long it took them so you know
when you talk about self-paced learning
it makes sense for everyone you know
education speak differentiated learning
but it&#39;s kind of crazy what happens when
you actually see it in a classroom
because every every time we&#39;ve done this
in every classroom we&#39;ve done over and
over again if you go five days into it
there&#39;s a group of kids who&#39;ve raced
ahead and there&#39;s a group of kids who
are a little bit slower and in a
traditional model if you did a snapshot
assessment you say oh these are the
gifted kids these are the slow kids
maybe they should be tracked differently
maybe we should put them in different
classes but when you let every student
work at their own pace we see it over
and over and over again you see students
who took a little bit extra time on one
concept or the other but once they get
through that concept they just race
ahead and so the same kids that you
thought were slow six weeks ago you now
would think are gifted and we&#39;re seeing
it over and over and over again it makes
you really wonder kind of how much all
of the labels maybe a lot of us have
benefited from we&#39;re really just due to
a coincidence of time now as valuable as
something like this is in a district
like Los Altos our goal is is to use
technology to humanize not just in Los
Altos but kind of on
global-scale well what&#39;s happening in
education and actually that kind of
brings an interesting point is it you
know a lot of the effort in humanizing
the classroom is focused on student to
teacher ratios in our mind the relevant
metric is student to valuable human time
with the teacher ratio so in a
traditional model most of the teachers
time is spent doing lectures and grading
tests and whatnot maybe five percent of
their time is actually sitting next to
students and actually working with them
now hundred percent of their time base
so once again using technology not just
flipping the classroom you&#39;re humanizing
the classroom I&#39;d argue by it by a
factor of five or ten and as valuable as
it is in Los Altos imagine what that
does to the adult learner who&#39;s
embarrassed to go back and learn stuff
that they should have known before
before going back to college imagine
imagine what it does to a kid a street
kid in Calcutta who has to help his
family during the day and that&#39;s the
reason why he or she can&#39;t go to school
now they can spend two hours a day and
remediate or get up to speed and not
feel embarrassed about what they do or
or don&#39;t know now imagine what happens
where you know we talked about the peers
teaching each other inside of a
classroom but this is all one system
there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t have
that that peer to peer tutoring beyond
that one classroom imagine what happens
if that student in Calcutta all of a
sudden can tutor your son or your son
can tutor that kid in Calcutta and I
think what you&#39;ll see emerging is this
notion of a global one-world classroom
and that&#39;s that&#39;s essentially what we&#39;re
what we&#39;re trying to build thank you
beautiful country
oh okay
and
I&#39;ve seen some things you&#39;re doing in
the system that have to do with
motivation and feedback energy points
merit badges tell me what you&#39;re
thinking there oh yeah no we have an
awesome team working on is not and I
have to be clear it&#39;s not just me
anymore I&#39;m still doing all the videos
we have a kind of a rockstar team doing
the software yeah we&#39;ve put a bunch of
game mechanics in there you get these
badges we&#39;re gonna start having
leaderboards by areas and you get points
it&#39;s actually been pretty interesting
just the wording of the badging or how
many points you get for doing something
we see on the system-wide basis like
tens of thousands of like fifth graders
or sixth graders going one direction or
another depending on what you know that
bad you give them and that collaboration
you&#39;re doing with Los Altos how did that
come about yeah don&#39;t look I&#39;ll just
been kind of it was kind of crazy they
once again I didn&#39;t expect it to be used
in classrooms someone from from their
board came and said Oh what would you do
if you had carte blanche in a classroom
and I said well you know I would just
every student work at their own pace on
something like this we&#39;d give a
dashboard it you know and they said oh
this is kind of radical we have to think
about it and I mean the rest of the team
like oh you know they&#39;re never going to
want to do this but literally the next
day they&#39;re like can you can you start
in two weeks okay so the fifth grade
math is four that&#39;s point it&#39;s to fifth
grade classes and to seventh grade
classes and I think they&#39;re doing at the
district level I think what they&#39;re
excited about is they can now follow
these kids it&#39;s not an only in-school
thing I mean we&#39;ve even you know on
Christmas we saw some of the kids we&#39;re
doing and we can track everything so
they can actually track them as they go
through the entire district through the
summers as they go from one teacher to
an X you have this continuity of data
that that even at the district level
they can see so some of those views we
saw were for the teacher to go in and
track actually what&#39;s going on with
those those kids so you&#39;re getting
feedback on those teacher views to see
what they think they need oh yeah
actually most of those were were kind of
specs by the teachers we made some of
those for students so they could see
their data but you know we have a very
tight design loop with the teachers
themselves and their lure saying hey you
know this is nice but I like that focus
graph a lot of student says a lot of the
teacher said I have a feeling that a lot
of the kids are jumping around and not
focusing on one topic so we made that
focus a diagram form so it&#39;s all been
teacher driven it&#39;s it&#39;s been it&#39;s been
pretty cray
is this ready for primetime you think a
lot of class classes next school year
should try this thing out yeah it&#39;s
ready it&#39;s you know it&#39;s uh we got a
million people on the side already so we
can handle a few more and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s
no no reason why why it really can&#39;t
happen in every classroom in America
tomorrow and that the vision of the
tutoring thing the idea there is if I&#39;m
confused about a topic somehow right and
user-interface I&#39;d find people who are
volunteering maybe see their reputation
and I could schedule and connect up with
those people absolutely you know and
this is something I recommend everyone
this audience to do is you can that
those dashboards the teachers have you
can go log in right now and you could
get you can essentially become a coach
for your for your kids your nephews your
cousins or maybe some kids at the Boys
and Girls Club and yeah you can start
becoming a mentor tutor really
immediately but yeah it&#39;s all there well
it&#39;s amazing I I think you just got a
glimpse of the future of Education thank
you thank you
you
