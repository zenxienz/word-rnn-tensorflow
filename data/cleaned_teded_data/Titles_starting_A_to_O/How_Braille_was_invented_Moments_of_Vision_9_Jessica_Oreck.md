In a Moment of Vision...
Early 1800s.
It&#39;s the middle of the Napoleonic Wars
in the middle of Europe,
and it&#39;s the middle of the night.
One Captain Charles Barbier
of Napoleon&#39;s army
is trying to relay a message
to one of his troops.
But sending written communications
to the front lines
can be deadly for the recipient.
Lighting a candle to read the missive can 
give away their positions to the enemy.
In a moment of vision,
Barbier pokes a series of holes
into a sheet of a paper with his blade,
creating a coded message that can be
deciphered by fingertip,
even in the pitch black.
The merits of his so-called night writing
are never acknowledged by the military,
but in 1821, Barbier approaches the
Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris
in the hopes that they might find a use
for his innovative, 
new communication method.
There, a precocious teen by the name
of Louis Braille does just that.
Louis spends the next several years
improving on Barbier&#39;s idea,
creating an organized alphabet
fitting into a six dot standardized cell.
The system catches on.
Today, Braille is the universally accepted
system of writing for the blind,
adapted for more than 130 languages.
