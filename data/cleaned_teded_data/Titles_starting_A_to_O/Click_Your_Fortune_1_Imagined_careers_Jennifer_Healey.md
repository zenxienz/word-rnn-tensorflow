Apparently when I was five years old,
I told my mother that I was tired
of her wanting me to be a doctor
and that I was going to MIT
to be an astrophysicist
because I really thought
that I would be seeking out the truth,
the truth in physics,
you know, the origins of the universe,
the laws by which all of existence exists,
and that&#39;s really what I wanted to do.
I wanted to do physics or astrophysics,
either I wanted to do atomic, subatomic physics
or astrophysics.
But I think it&#39;s because that my mother
had taken me to the omnitheater planetarium
at the Museum of Science,
and I was extremely impacted by that visit,
and I was fascinated by black holes.
And I really wanted to know if there were white holes,
like, if you went through a black hole,
what happened?
I remember for some reason
that question just completely fascinated me
when I was young.
So, astrophysics.
