Top interview tip is do your research.
There&#39;s nothing worse
than when I&#39;ve been interviewing candidates
where they&#39;ve come to the interview
and made a major boo-boo,
which just told me that they hadn&#39;t done any research.
And I&#39;m probably a stickler for research
because as a former journalist,
it&#39;s something that&#39;s kind of core
to what your whole career is about.
So, yeah, do your research,
and I think from that you&#39;ll find confidence
will come quite easily within the interview
because you&#39;re prepared.
So, yeah, be prepared,
do your research,
and confidence will be the outcome of that.
