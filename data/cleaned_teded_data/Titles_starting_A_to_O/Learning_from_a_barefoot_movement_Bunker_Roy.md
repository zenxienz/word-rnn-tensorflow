I&#39;d like to take you to another world
and I&#39;d like to share a 45 year old love
story with the poor living on less than
one dollar a day I went to a very
elitist snobbish expensive education in
India and that almost destroyed me I was
all set to be a diplomat teacher dr. all
laid out then I don&#39;t look it but I was
in your national squash champion for
three years the whole world was laid out
for me everything is on my feet could do
nothing wrong and then I thought out of
curiosity I&#39;d like to go and live in a
work just see what a village is like so
in 1965 I went to what is called the
worst be hard famine in india and i saw
starvation death people dying of hunger
for the first time change my life came
back home told my mother i like to live
and work in a village mother went into a
coma
what is this whole world is laid out for
you the best jobs are laying out for you
and you want to go work in a village I
mean is there something wrong with you I
said no I&#39;ve got the best education it
made me think and I wanted to give
something back in my own way what do you
want to do in a village no job no money
no security no prospect I said I want to
live and dig wells for five years dig
wells for five years you went to the
most expensive school and college in
India and you want to dig wells for five
years she don&#39;t speak to me for for many
long time because she thought I&#39;d let my
family down but then I was exposed to
the most extraordinary knowledge and
skills that very poor people have which
has never bought into mainstream which
is never identified respected applied in
a large scale and I thought I&#39;d start a
Barefoot college college only for the
poor or the poor thought was important
would be reflected in the college went
to this village of the first time elders
came to me and said are you running from
the police I said no
you fail in your exam I said no you
didn&#39;t get a government job I said no
what are you doing here why are you here
the education system in India makes you
look look at Paris and Delhi and Zurich
what are you doing in this village is
there something wrong with you don&#39;t not
telling us said no I want to actually
start a college only for the poor but
the poor thought was important would be
reflected in the college so then there&#39;s
give me some very sound and profound
advice they said please don&#39;t bring
anyone with a degree and qualification
into your college so it&#39;s the only
college in India where if you should
have a PhD or a master&#39;s you&#39;re
disqualified to come you have to be a
cop out or a washout or a dropout to
come to our College you have to work
with your hands you have to have a
dignity of labour you have to show that
you have a skill that you can offer to
the community ders and provide a service
to the community so we started the
Barefoot college and we redefined
professionalism who is a professional or
professionally someone who has a
combination of competence confidence and
belief a water diviner is a professional
but traditional Midwife is a
professional a traditional bonesetter is
a professional these are professionals
all over the world you&#39;ll find them in
any inaccessible village around the
world and we thought that these people
should come into mainstream and show
that the knowledge and skills that they
have is universal needs to be used in
she replies you to be shown to the world
outside that these knowledge and skills
are relevant even today so the college
works
following the lifestyle and work style
of magma Gandhi you eaten the flow you
sleep on the floor you work on the floor
there are no contracts no written
contracts you can stay with me for 20
years go tomorrow and no one can get
more than one hundred dollars a month
you come for the money you don&#39;t come to
Barefoot college you come for the work
and the challenge you come to the
Barefoot college that is where we want
you to try crazy ideas whatever idea you
have come and try doesn&#39;t matter if you
fail battered bruised you start again
it&#39;s the only college where the teacher
is the learner and the learner is the
teacher and it&#39;s the only color we don&#39;t
give a certificate you are certified by
the community you serve you don&#39;t need a
paper to hang on the wall to show that
you are an engineer so when they said
that they said well show us what is
possible what are you doing this is all
mumbo jumbo you can&#39;t shoot on the
ground so we built the first Barefoot
college in 1986 it was built by 12
barefoot architects who can&#39;t read and
write built on one dollar of 50 a square
foot 150 peoples lived their work there
they&#39;ve got the agha khan award for
architecture in 2002 but then they
suspected they thought there was an
architect behind it I said yes they made
the blueprints but the barefoot
architects actually was constructed the
college we are the only ones you
actually return the award for fifty
thousand dollars because they didn&#39;t
believe us and we thought that they were
actually casting explosions on the
barefoot architects of Selonia I asked a
forester I powered paper qualified
expert I said what can you build in this
place he had one look at the soil and
said forget it no way nothing in what no
no water rocky soil I was in a bit of a
spot and I said okay I&#39;ll go to the old
man in the village and say what should I
grow in this pot I he looked quietly at
me and said you buy this
well this you put this until what this
is what it looks like today went to the
roof and all the women said clear out
the men should clear out because we
don&#39;t want to share this technology with
the men this is waterproofing the roof
it is a bit of jaggery bit of you in a
bit of other things I don&#39;t know but it
actually doesn&#39;t leak since 1986 it
hasn&#39;t leaked this technology the women
will not share with a man it&#39;s the only
college which is fully solar electrified
all the power comes from the Sun 45 kilo
watts of panels on the roof and
everything works out the fun for the
next 25 years so long as the Sun shines
have no problem with power for the
beauty is that it was installed by a
priest a Hindu priest whose only done
eight years of primary schooling never
been to school never been to college you
know more about solar than anyone I know
anywhere in the world guaranteed food if
you come to the Barefoot college is
solar cooked but the people who
fabricated that solar cooker our women
illiterate women who actually fabricate
the most sophisticated solar cooker it&#39;s
a parabolic scheffler solar cooker
unfortunately they&#39;re almost half German
they&#39;re so precise
never find Indian women&#39;s so precise
absolutely to the last inch they can
make that cooker and we have 60 miles
twice a day of solar cooking we have a
dentist to the grandmother illiterate
with a dentist she actually looks after
teeth of 7,000 children therefore
technology this was 1986 no engineer no
architect thought of it but we are
collecting rainwater from the roofs very
little water is wasted all the roofs are
connected underground to a 400,000 liter
tank and know what is wasted if you have
four years of round we still have water
in the campus because we collect
rainwater sixty percent of children
don&#39;t go to school because they have to
look after animals sheep goats domestic
chores so we thought of starting a
school at night for the children because
the night schools of colonia over 75,000
children have gone through these night
schools because it&#39;s for the convenience
of the of the child is not with the
convenience of the teacher and what do
we teach in the schools democracy
citizenship how you should measure your
land what you should do if you are
arrested what should you feel if you if
your own animal is sick this is what we
teach in the night schools but all the
schools on solar lit every five years we
have an election between 6 to 14 year
old children participate in a democratic
process and they elect a prime minister
a prime minister is 12 years old he
looks after 20 goats in the morning but
she&#39;s prime minister in the evening she
has a cabinet minister of Education
Minister of Energy Minister for health
and they actually monitor and supervise
150 schools for 7,000 children she got
the world&#39;s children&#39;s prize five years
ago and she went to Sweden first time
ever going out of a village never seen
Sweden wasn&#39;t dazzled at all by what was
happening and the queen of Sweden which
they turned to me and said can you ask
this child where she got her confidence
from she&#39;s only 12 years old which is
not dazzled by anything and the girl was
on a left turned to me and looked at the
Queen straight in the eye and said
please tell her I&#39;m the Prime Minister
we&#39;re this percentage of illiteracy is
very high we use puppetry puppet is the
way we communicate
you have Joakim cha-cha who&#39;s 300 years
old he is my psychoanalyst he&#39;s my
teacher is my doctor is my lawyer he is
my donor he actually raised his money
solves my disputes he solves my problems
in the village if there&#39;s tension in the
village if the attendance in the
school&#39;s go down in the friction between
the teacher and the parent the puppet
calls the teacher and the parent in
front of the whole village and says
shake hands the attendants must not drop
these puppets are made out of recycled
World Bank reports
so this decentralized demystified
approach of solar electrifying villages
we&#39;ve covered all over india from Ladakh
up to Bhutan all solar electrified
villages by people who have been trained
and we went on the dock and we asked his
woman this at minus-40 you have to come
out of the roof because there&#39;s no place
was all snowed up on both sides and we
asked this woman what was the benefit
you had from solar electricity and she
thought for a minute and said is the
first time I can see my husband&#39;s face
in winter
went to Afghanistan one lesson we learnt
in India was men are untrainable
men are restless men ambitious men are
compulsively mobile and the old one is
certificate
all across the globe you&#39;ll have this
tendency of men wanting a certificate
why because they want to leave the
village and go to a city looking for a
job so we came up with a great solution
train grandmothers what&#39;s the best way
of communicating in the world today
television no telegraph no telephone no
tell a woman so we went you have done is
done for the first time and we picture
women and say we want to take them to
India they said impossible they don&#39;t
even go out of the room then you want to
take them to India I said I&#39;ll make a
concession I&#39;ll take the husband&#39;s along
as well so i took the husband&#39;s along of
course the women were much more
intelligent than the men in six months
how do we change these women sign
language you don&#39;t use the written word
you don&#39;t use the spoken word you use
sign language and in six months they can
become solar engineers
they go back and soul Electrify their
own village this woman went back and
soul electrified the first village set
up a workshop the first village ever to
be solar electrified in Afghanistan go
by the three women this woman is an
extraordinary grandmother 55 years old
and she&#39;s sol electrified 200 houses for
me in afghanistan and they haven&#39;t
collapsed she actually went and spoke to
an engineering department in Afghanistan
a told the head of a department the
difference between AC and DC didn&#39;t know
those three women have trained 27 more
women and soul electrified 100 villages
in Afghanistan we went to Africa and we
did the same thing all these women
sitting in one table from 8-9 countries
all chatting to each other not
understanding a word because they all
speak in a different language but the
body language is great they&#39;re speaking
to each other and actually becoming
solar engineers I went to sur le on and
there was this minister driving down the
dead of night comes across this village
comes back goes to it goes into the
village says the house what&#39;s the story
they said these two grandmother&#39;s
grandmother&#39;s minister couldn&#39;t believe
what was happening where did it go went
to India and back went straight to the
president he said you know there&#39;s a
soul electrified village in Sierra Leone
he said no half the cabinet went to see
the grandmothers next day what&#39;s the
story so he summoned me and said can you
train me hundred fifty grandmother&#39;s I
said I can&#39;t mr. president but they will
the grand modular so it will be the
first barefoot training center in Sierra
Leone and 150 grand mothers are being
trained in cerulean Gambia I went to
select the grandmother in Gambia went to
this village I knew which woman I would
like to take the community got together
and said I&#39;ll take these two women I
said no I&#39;m going to take this woman
Miss advised she doesn&#39;t know the line
you don&#39;t know i said no i like the body
language i like the way she speaks
difficult husband not possible call the
husband husband came so I getting
politician mobile in his hand not
possible why not the woman look how
beautiful she is I said yeah she&#39;s very
beautiful what happens if she runs off
with an Indian man that was the biggest
fear I said he&#39;ll be happy she&#39;d ring up
in a mobile she went like a grandmother
and came back like a tiger she walked
out of the plane and spoke to the whole
press as if she was a veteran she
handled the national press and she was a
star and when I went back six months
later said where&#39;s your husband Oh
somewhere doesn&#39;t matter good my success
story
I just wind up by saying that I think
you don&#39;t have to look for solutions
outside look for solutions within and
listen to people they have the solutions
in front of you they&#39;re all over the
world don&#39;t even worry don&#39;t listen to
the World Bank listen to the people on
the ground they have all the solutions
in the world I&#39;ll end with a quotation
by Mark McGowan first they ignore you
then they laugh at you then they fight
you and then you win thank
