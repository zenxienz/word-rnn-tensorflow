what is it about flying cars we&#39;ve
wanted to do this for about a hundred
years and there are historic attempts
that have had some level of technical
success but we haven&#39;t yet gotten to the
point where on your way here this
morning you see something that really
truly seamlessly integrates the
two-dimensional world that were
comfortable in with the
three-dimensional sky above us that I
don&#39;t know about you but I really enjoy
spending time in we looked at the
historical attempts that had been out
there and realized that despite the fact
that we have a lot of modern innovations
to draw on today that weren&#39;t available
previously we have modern composite
materials we have aircraft engines that
get good fuel economy and have better
power-to-weight ratios and have ever
been available we have glass cockpit
avionics that bring the information you
need to fly directly to you in the
cockpit but without fundamentally
addressing the problem from a different
perspective we realized that we were
going to be getting the same result that
people had been getting for the last
hundred years which isn&#39;t where we want
to be right now so instead of trying to
make a car that can fly we decided to
try to make a plane that could drive and
the result is the Terrafugia transition
it&#39;s a two-seat single-engine airplane
that works just like any other smaller
plane you take off and land at a local
airport then once you&#39;re on the ground
you fold up the wings drive at home park
it in your garage and it works after two
years of an iterative design and
construction process the proof of
concept made its public debut in 2008
now like with anything that&#39;s really
different from the status quo it didn&#39;t
always go so well testing that aircraft
and we discovered that it&#39;s a very good
thing that when you go home with
something that&#39;s been broken you&#39;ve
actually learned a lot more than when
you manage to tick off all of your test
objectives the first time through so we
very much wanted to see the aircraft
that we&#39;d all helped build in the air
off the ground like it was supposed to
be and on our third high speed testing
deployment on a bitter cold morning in
upstate New York we got to do that for
first time the picture behind me was
stamped by the copilot in our chase
aircraft just moments after the wheels
got off the ground for the first time
and we were all very flattered to see
that image become a symbol of
accomplishing something that people had
thought was impossible really the world
over the flight testing that followed
that was as basic and low-risk as we
could make it but it still accomplished
what we needed to to take the program to
the next step and again the credibility
that we needed within our eventual
market the general aviation community
and with the regulator&#39;s that govern the
use of design of aircraft is
particularly in the States the FAA about
a year ago gave us an exemption for the
transition tale allow us to have an
additional 110 pounds within the
light-sport aircraft category now that
doesn&#39;t sound like a lot but it&#39;s very
important because being able to deliver
the transition as a light-sport aircraft
makes it simpler for us to certify it
but it also makes it much easier for you
to learn how to fly it a sport pilot can
be certificated in as little as 20 hours
of flight time and that 110 pounds
that&#39;s very important for solving the
other side of the equation driving it
turns out that driving with its
associated design implementation and
regulatory hurdles is actually a harder
problem to solve than flying for those
of us that spend most of our lives on
the ground this may be counterintuitive
but driving has potholes cobblestones
pedestrians other drivers and a rather
long and detailed list of federal motor
vehicle safety standards to contend with
fortunately necessity remains the mother
of invention and a lot of the design
work that were the most proud of with
the aircraft came out of solving the
unique problems of operating it on the
ground everything from continuously
variable transmission and liquid based
cooling system that allows us to use an
aircraft engine and stop and go traffic
to a custom-designed gearbox that powers
either the propeller when you&#39;re flying
or the wheels on the ground to the
automated wing folding mechanism that
we&#39;ll see in a moment to crash safety
features we have a carbon-fiber safety
cage that protects the occupants for
less than ten percent of the weight of a
traditional steel chassis in a car now
this also as good as it is wasn&#39;t quite
enough the regulations for vehicles on
the road weren&#39;t written
with an airplane in mind so we did need
a little bit of support from the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration you may have seen in the
news recently they came through with us
at the end of last month with a few
special exemptions that will allow the
transition to be sold in the same
category as SUVs and light trucks as a
multi-purpose passenger vehicle it is
now officially quote designed for
occasional off-road use now let&#39;s see it
in action
you can see there the wings folded up
just along the side of the plane you&#39;re
not powering the propeller you&#39;re
powering the wheels
and it is under seven feet tall so it
will fit in a standard construction
garage and that&#39;s the automated wing
folding mechanism that&#39;s real time you
just push a few buttons in the cockpit
and the wings come out once they&#39;re
fully deployed there&#39;s a mechanical lock
that goes into place again from inside
the cockpit and they&#39;re now fully
capable of handling and either loads
that you would see in flight just like
putting on your convertible top and
you&#39;re all thinking what your neighbors
would think of seeing that right until
the vehicle flies you know seventy-five
percent of your risk is at first plane
we were all exceedingly excited about
that little bunny hop and our test pilot
gave us the best feedback that you can
get from a test pilot after a first
flight which was that it was remarkably
unremarkable he would go on to tell us
that the transition had been the easiest
airplane to land that he&#39;d flown in his
entire 30-year career as a test pilot
so despite making something that is
seemingly revolutionary we really focus
on doing as little knew as possible we
leverage a lot of technology from the
state of the art in general aviation and
from automotive racing when we do have
to do something truly out of the box we
use an incremental design-build tests
redesign cycle that lets us reduce risk
and baby steps now since we started
Terrafugia about six years ago we&#39;ve had
a lot of those baby steps we&#39;ve gone
from being three of us working in the
basement at MIT while we were still in
graduate school to about two dozen of us
working in an initial production
facility outside of Boston we&#39;ve had to
overcome challenges like keeping the
weight below the lights for at limit
that I talked about figuring out how to
politely respond when a regulator tells
you but that won&#39;t fit through a
tollbooth with the wings extended to all
of the other associated durability and
engineering issues that we talked about
on the ground still if everything goes
to our satisfaction with the testing and
construction of the two production
prototypes that we&#39;re working on right
now those first deliveries to our about
a hundred people that have reserved an
airplane at this point should begin at
the end of next year the transition will
cost in line with other small airplanes
and I&#39;m certainly not out to replace
your Chevy but I do think that the
transition should be your next airplane
here&#39;s why while nearly all of the
commercial air travel in the world goes
through a relatively small number of
large hub airports there is a huge
underutilized resource out there there
are thousands of local air strips that
don&#39;t seem nearly as many aircraft
operations a day as they could on
average there&#39;s one within 20 to 30
miles of wherever you are in the United
States the transition gives you a safer
more convenient and more fun way of
using this resource for those of you who
aren&#39;t yet pilots there&#39;s four main
reasons why those of us who are don&#39;t
fly as much as we&#39;d like to their
weather primarily cost long door-to-door
travel time I&#39;m ability at your
destination now bad weather comes in
just land fold up the wings drive home
does it matter if it rains a little you
have a windshield wiper instead of
paying to keep your airplane and a
hanger parking in your garage and the
unloaded automotive fuel that
we use is both cheaper and better for
the environment than traditional ab gas
door-to-door travel time is reduced
because now instead of lugging bags
finding a parking space taking off your
shoes or pulling your plan out at a
hanger you&#39;re now just spending that
time getting to where you want to go and
mobility at your destination is clearly
solved just fold up the wings and keep
going the transition simultaneously
expand our horizons while making the
world a smaller more accessible place it
also continues to be a fabulous
adventure I hope that you&#39;ll need to
take a moment to think about how you
could use something like this to give
yourself more access to your own world
and to make your own travel more
convenient and more fun thank you for
giving me the opportunity to share it
with you
