My name is Shayna Cody,
and I go to Bard High School Early College.
I&#39;m a twin.
I&#39;m so competitive with my twin sister.
We compete about everything.
When my sister finishes homework before me,
she usually rubs it in my face.
We&#39;re just so competitive about everything.
I think a fully-rounded education is not just sitting there
doing the work that&#39;s required of you,
but actually taking the time to, like, focus in
and learn what you can out of your classes.
I feel like, whatever I do,
I want to be the best at what I do.
Failure is not an option.
My dream job when I leave school
is to become a cardiologist.
Every Saturday morning, I go to a program
called The Lang Youth Medical Program.
It&#39;s a pre-medical program where we prepare
to become doctors.
It&#39;s a six-year program.
I got in at 7th grade in my middle school,
and they stay with you all the way up until 12th grade.
We learn about viruses,
we learn about the body.
I feel I&#39;ve grown a whole lot
since I&#39;ve been in high school.
I feel like I&#39;ve had to grow up.
You can&#39;t be the same person
that you were when you went in there,
otherwise, you&#39;re not going to get anything out of it.
