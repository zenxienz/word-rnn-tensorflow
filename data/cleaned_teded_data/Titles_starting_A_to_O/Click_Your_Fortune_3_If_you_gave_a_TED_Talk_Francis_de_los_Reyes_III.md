I&#39;m really interested in making people understand
about sanitation issues in the developing world.
And I think if I were to give a TED Talk,
I would focus on that,
on the 2.5 billion people
who don&#39;t have access to sanitation
and try to show solutions
and also how we should change
how we think about this problem
because it&#39;s really a big, big problem in the world.
