[How did you find the job
that you currently have?]
This is, actually, I think the way

things are going to be:
&quot;I didn&#39;t find it, I created it.&quot;
I created the job that I currently have.
And I think that&#39;s going to happen
a lot in the future, too.
As a matter of fact, I think people
are going to have multiple jobs.
They&#39;ll have jobs
that they&#39;re passionate about,
others that pay the bills, I think.
I think that&#39;s a really good way to go,
because you&#39;ll always have
something going on,
you&#39;re always excited about something,
there&#39;s a lot more change in your life;
it makes it more interesting.
So that would be my answer to that.
