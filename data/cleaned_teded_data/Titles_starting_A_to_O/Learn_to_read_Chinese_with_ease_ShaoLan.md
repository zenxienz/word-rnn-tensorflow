growing up in Taiwan as a daughter
calligrapher one of my most treasured
memories was my mother showing me the
beauty the shape and the form of Chinese
characters ever since then I was
fascinated by this incredible language
but to an outsider it seems to be as
impenetrable as a Great Wall of China
over the past few years I&#39;ve been
wondering if I can break down this wall
so anyone who wants to understand and
appreciate the beauty of this
sophisticated language to do so I
started thinking about how a new fast
method of learning Chinese might be
useful since the age of five I started
to learn how to draw every single stroke
for each character at correct sequence
II I learn new characters every day
during the course of the next 15 years
since we only have five minutes is
better that we have a fast and simple
way a Chinese scholar would understand
20,000 characters
you only need 1,000 to understand the
basic literacy the top 200 will allow
you to comprehend 40% of basic
literature enough to redraw sign
restaurant menu to understand the basic
idea of the web pages or the newspapers
today I&#39;m going to start with 8 to show
you how the method works you&#39;re ready
open your mouth as wide as possible
until is square you get a mouse this is
a person going for a walk person if the
shape of the fire is a person with two
arms and both sides as if she was
yelling frantically help I&#39;m on fire the
simple actions originally found the
shape of the flame but I like to think
that way whichever works for you this is
a tree tree
this is the mountain the some
the moon
the symbol of the door looks like a pair
of southern door in the Wild West
I call these eight characters radicals
they are the building blocks for you to
create lots more characters a person if
someone walks behind them is to follow
as old saying goes to his company
three&#39;s a crowd
if a person stretch the arms wide this
person is saying it was this big the
person is that the mouse the president
wrapped he&#39;s a prisoner just like Jonah
inside the whale one tree is a tree two
trees together we have the woods three
trees together we create the forest put
a plank underneath the tree we have the
foundation for the mouse on the top of
the tree that&#39;s idiot easy to remember
since the talking tree is pretty and
idiotic remember fire two files together
I get really hot three files together
that&#39;s a lot of flames set the fire
underneath the two trees it&#39;s burning
for us the Sun is the source prosperity
two sounds together prosperous three
together the subtle sparkles
put a Sun and the moon shining together
it&#39;s brightness it&#39;s also means tomorrow
after a day and a night the Sun is
coming up above the horizon sunrise
adore to the plank inside the door we
store boat for the mouse inside a door
asking questions knock-knock is anyone
home this person is leaking out of a
door escaping evading on the Left we
have a woman two women together they
have an argument
three women together the careful is
adultery so we have gone through almost
30 characters by using this method the
first eight radicals will allow you to
filter tea to the next group asserts
eight characters will build an extra 32
so within very little effort you will be
able to learn a couple hundred
characters which is the same as a
Chinese eight-year-old so after we know
the characters we start building phrases
for example the mountain and the fire
together we have Fire Mountain it&#39;s a
volcano
we know Japan is land of Rising Sun this
is the Sun putting with the origin
because Japan lies in the east of China
so the Sun origin together we build
Japan a person behind Japan whatever
guard Japanese person the character on
the left is two mountains stacked on the
top of each other in ancient China that
means in exile because Chinese emperor
they put political enemies in exile
beyond mountains nowadays exile has
turned into getting out a mouth which
tells you where to get out is an exit
this is a slightly might mean that I
should stop talking and get other stage
thank you
