my name is Ahmet and 18 months ago I had
another job at Google
and I pitched this idea of doing
something with museums and art to my
boss was actually here and she allowed
me to do it and it took 18 months a lot
of fun negotiations and stories I can
tell you with 17 very interesting
museums from nine countries but I&#39;m
gonna focus on the demo a lot of stories
about why we did this I think my
personal story is explained raised
simply in the slide and it&#39;s access and
I grew up in India had a great education
not complaining but I didn&#39;t have access
to a lot of these museums and these
artworks and so when I started traveling
and going to these museums I started
learning a lot and while working at
Google I try to put this desire to make
it more accessible with technology
together so we formed a team a great
team of people and we started doing this
I&#39;m gonna probably get into the demo and
then you know tell you a couple of the
interesting things we&#39;ve had since
launch so simple you come to Google Art
Project calm you look around all these
museums here you got Uffizi you got the
MoMA the homie Taj the reich&#39;s the Rango
I&#39;m gonna actually get to one of my
favorites the Metropolitan Museum of Art
in New York two ways of going in very
simple click and bang you&#39;re in this
museum doesn&#39;t matter where you are
Bombay Mexico doesn&#39;t really matter you
move around you have fun you want to
navigate around the museum open the plan
up and in one click jump you&#39;re in there
you want to go to the end of the
corridor
keep going have fun you know explore
Thanks I haven&#39;t come to the best part
sir so now I&#39;m in front of one of my
favorite paintings the harvesters by
Pieter Bruegel at the Met I see this
plus sign if the museum has given us the
image you click on it now this is one of
the images so this is all the metadata
information for those of you who are
truly interested in art you can click
this but I&#39;m gonna click this off right
now and this is one of these images that
we captured and what we call gigapixel
technologies so this image for example
has close to I think around 10 billion
pixels and I get a lot of people asking
me what do you get for 10 billion pixels
so I&#39;m gonna try and show you what you
really get for 10 billion pixels you can
zoom around very simply you know you see
some fun stuff happening here you know I
love this guy his expression is
priceless but but then you really want
to go deep and so I started playing
around and I found something going on
over here and I was like hold on
that sounds interesting went in and I
started noticing that these kids were
actually beating something I did a
little research spoke to a couple of my
contacts at the Met and actually found
out that this is a game called Scholl
which involves beating a goose with a
stick on Shrove Tuesday and apparently
it was quite popular I don&#39;t know why
they did it but you know I learned
something about it now just you know
we&#39;re really deeper and you can really
get the cracks now just to give you some
perspective I&#39;m gonna zoom out so you
really see what you get here is where we
were and this is the painting so
the best is yet to come so so now let&#39;s
just quickly jump into the moma again in
New York so another one of my favorites
the starry night now the example I
showed you was all about finding details
but what if you want to see brushstrokes
and what if you want to see you know how
Wango actually created this masterpiece
zoom in you&#39;re really going I&#39;m gonna go
to one of my favorite parts in this
painting and I&#39;m really gonna get to the
cracks this is the starry night I think
you know never seen like this before I&#39;m
gonna show you my other favorite feature
there&#39;s a lot of other stuff here but I
don&#39;t have time this is the real cool
part it&#39;s called collections anyone of
you anybody doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re
rich if you&#39;re poor if you have you know
a fancy you know house doesn&#39;t matter
you can go and create your own Museum
online create your own collection across
all these images very simply you go in
and I&#39;ve created this called the power
of zoom you can just zoom around this is
the ambassador&#39;s based international
gallery you can annotate this stuff send
it to your friends and really get a
conversation going about what you&#39;re
feeling when you go through these
masterpieces so I think in conclusion
for me the main thing is that all the
amazing stuff here does not really come
from Google it doesn&#39;t in my opinion
even come from the museum&#39;s polish and
say that it really comes from these
artists and you know that&#39;s been my
humbling experience in this I mean I
hope in this digital medium that we do
justice to their artwork and represented
properly online and the biggest question
I get asked nowadays is did you do this
to replicate the experience of going to
a museum and the answer is no it&#39;s to
supplement the experience and that&#39;s it
thank you
