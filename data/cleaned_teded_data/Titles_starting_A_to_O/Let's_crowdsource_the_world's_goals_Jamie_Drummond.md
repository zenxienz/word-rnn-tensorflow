so let me start by taking you back back
into the mists of your memory to perhaps
the most anticipated year in your life
but certainly the most anticipated here
in all human history the year 2000
remember that y2k the.com bubble
stressing about whose party are going to
go to as the clock strikes midnight
before the champagne goes flat and then
there&#39;s that inchoate yearning that was
felt I think by many that the millennium
that the year 2000 should mean more more
than just the two and some zeros well
amazingly for once our world leaders
actually lived up to that millennium
moment and back in two thousand agreed
some pretty extraordinary stuff
visionary measurable long-term targets
called the Millennium Development Goals
now I&#39;m sure you all keep a copy the
gold under your pillow or by the bedside
table but just in case you don&#39;t and
your memory needs some jogging the deal
agreed then goes like this developing
countries promise to at least have
extreme poverty hunger and death from
disease alongside some other targets by
2015 and developed nations promise to
help them get that done by dropping
debts increasing smart aid and trade
reform well reproaching 2015 so we
better assess how are we doing on these
goals but we&#39;ve also got to decide do we
like such global goals some people don&#39;t
and if we like them we&#39;ve got to decide
what we want to do on these goals going
forward what does the world want to do
together we got to decide a process by
which we decide well I definitely think
these goals are worth building on and
seeing through and here&#39;s just a few
reasons why incredible partnerships
between the private sector political
leaders philanthropists and amazing
grassroots activists across the
developing world but also 250,000 people
marched in the streets of Edinburgh
outside this very building for make
history all together they achieve these
results increase the number of people on
antiretrovirals life-saving anti-aids
drugs nearly halved deaths from malaria
vaccinated so many that 5.4 million
lives will be saved and combined this is
going to result in 2 million fewer
children dying every year last year than
in the year 2000 that&#39;s five thousand
fewer kids dying every day ten times you
lot not dead every day because of all of
these partnerships so I think this is
amazing living proof of progress that
more people should know about but the
challenge of communicating this kind of
good news is probably the subject of a
different TED talk anyway for now anyone
involved in getting these results thank
you I think this proved these goals are
worth it but there&#39;s still a lot of
unfinished business still 7.6 million
children die every year of preventable
treatable diseases and 178 million kids
are malnourished to the point of
stunting a horrible term which means
physical and cognitive lifelong
impairment so there&#39;s plainly a lot more
to do on the goals we&#39;ve got but then a
lot of people think there are things
that should have been in the original
package that weren&#39;t agreed that then
that should now be included like
sustainable development targets natural
resource governance targets access to
opportunity to knowledge equity fighting
corruption all of this is measurable and
could be in the new goals but the key
thing here is what do you think should
be in the new girls what do you want d
you annoyed that I didn&#39;t talk about
gender equality or or education should
those be new package of goals and quite
frankly that&#39;s a good question but
there&#39;s going to be some tough
trade-offs and choices here so you want
to hope that the process by which the
world decides these new goals is going
to be legitimate right well as we gather
here in Edinburgh technocrats appointed
by the UN and certain governments were
the best intentions are busying
themselves designing a new package of
goals and currently they&#39;re doing that
through pretty much the same old late
20th century top-down elite closed
process but of course since then the web
and mobile telephony along with
ubiquitous reality TV
matts have spread all around the world
so what we&#39;d like to propose is that we
use them to involve people from all
around the world in an historic first
the world&#39;s first truly global poll and
consultation where everyone everywhere
has an equal voice for the very first
time I mean wouldn&#39;t it be a huge
historic missed opportunity not to do
this given that we can there&#39;s hundreds
of billions of your aid dollars at stake
tens of millions of lives or deaths at
stake and I&#39;d argue the security and
future of you and your family is also at
stake so if you&#39;re with me I&#39;d say
there&#39;s three essential steps in this
crowd sourcing campaign collecting
connecting and committing so first of
all we got to ground this campaign in
cool polling data let&#39;s go into every
country that will let us in ask a
thousand and one people what they want
the new goals to be making special
efforts to reach the poorest those
without access to modern technology and
let&#39;s make sure that their views are at
the center of the goals going forward
then we&#39;ve got to a commission a
baseline survey to make sure we can
monitor in progress the goals going
forward the original goals didn&#39;t really
have good baseline survey data and we&#39;re
going to need the help of big data
through all throughout all of this
process to make sure we can really
monitor the progress then we go to
connect with the big crowd now here we
see the role for a unprecedented
coalition of social media Giants and
upstarts telecoms companies reality TV
show formats gaming companies telecoms
all of them together in kind of there we
are the world moment could they come
together and help the Millennium
Development Goals get rebranded into the
Millennial generations goals and if just
five percent of the five billion plus
who are currently connected made a
comment and that comment turned into a
commitment we could crowd source of
force of 300 million people around the
world to help see these goals through if
we have this collected data and this
connected crowd based upon our
experience of campaigning and getting
world leaders
it I think world leaders will commit to
most of the crowd-sourced
recommendations but the question really
is through this process where we all
have become committed and if we are are
we ready to iterate monitor and provide
feedback make sure these promises are
really delivering results well there&#39;s
some fantastic examples here to scale up
mostly piloted within Africa actually
there&#39;s open data Kenya which geocodes
and crowdsources information about where
projects are are they delivering results
often they&#39;re not in the right place and
OSHA ed which means witness in Swahili
at which geocodes and crowdsources
information in complex emergencies to
help target responses this is some of
the most exciting stuff in development
and democracy were citizens on the edge
of the network helping to force open the
process to make sure that the big global
aid promises and vague get the stuff up
at the top really delivers to people at
a grassroots level and inverts that
pyramid this openness this forcing
openness is key and if it wasn&#39;t
entirely transparent already I should be
open I&#39;ve got a completely transparent
agenda long-term trend suggests that
this century is going to be a tough
place to live with population increases
consumption patterns increasing and
conflict over scarce natural resources
and look at the state of global politics
today look at the rio earth summit that
happened just last week or the mexican
g20 also last week both if we&#39;re honest
a bust our world leaders our global
politics currently can&#39;t get it done
they need our help they need the cavalry
and the cover is not going to come from
Mars it&#39;s got to come from us and I see
this process of deciding democratically
in a bottom-up fashion what the world
wants to work on together as one vital
means by which we can crowdsource the
force to really build that constituency
that&#39;s going to reinvigorate global
governance in the 21st century i started
in 2000 let me finish in 20-30 many
people made fun of a big campaign
a few years ago we had called make
poverty history it was a naive thought
in many people&#39;s minds and it&#39;s true it
was just a t-shirt slogan that worked
for the moment but look the empirical
condition of living under a dollar in 25
is trending down and look where it gets
to by 2030 it&#39;s getting near zero now
sure progress in China and India and
poverty reduction there was key to that
but recently also in Africa poverty
rates are being reduced it will get
harder as we get towards 0 as the poor
will be increasing located in
post-conflict fragile states or maybe in
middle-income states where they don&#39;t
really care about the marginalized but
I&#39;m confident with the right kind of
political campaigning and creative and
technological innovation combined
working together more and more as one I
think we can get this another goals done
thank
Jim here&#39;s the the puzzle to me if there
was an incident today we&#39;re a hundred
kids died in some tragedy or wheres a
hundred kids were kidnapped and then
rescued by Special Forces it would be
all over the news for a week right you
just put up just as one of your numbers
there that five thousand is it that the
number five thousand fewer children
dying every day I mean it it Dwarfs
Dwarfs everything that is actually on
our news agenda and it&#39;s invisible this
must drive you crazy it does and we&#39;re
having a huge debate in this country
about aid levels for example an aid
alone is not the whole solution nobody
thinks it is but you know if people saw
the results of this smart aid that I
mean there&#39;d be going crazy for it I
wish the 250,000 people who really did
march outside this very building new
these results right now they don&#39;t and
it would be great to find a way to
better communicate it because we have
not creatively we failed to communicate
this success so far if those kinds of
efforts just could multiply their voice
and amplify other key moments I know for
a fact we&#39;d get better policy the
Mexican g20 need not have been a bust
Rio if anyone cares about the
environment need not have been a bust
okay that these conferences are going on
and I know people get skeptical and
cynical about the big global summits and
the promises and they&#39;re never being
kept but actually the bits that are are
making a difference and what the
politicians need is more permission from
the public but you haven&#39;t fully worked
out the web mechanisms etc by which this
might happen I mean if that people here
who&#39;ve had experience using open
platforms you&#39;re interested to talk with
them this week and try and take this
absolutely all right well I must say if
this conference led in some way to
advancing that idea that that&#39;s a huge
idea and if you carry that forward that
is really awesome so thank you home
thank you thank you
you
