there&#39;s going to be a faster and faster
pace of technology
and how humans interact with technology
will really be a crucial thing.
I think there&#39;s a certain rate
at which us humans can adapt to technology,
and there might be a niche for somebody
who can help us transition
to the different changes in technology,
so more like a personalized technologist,
you know, assistant,
that can help us transition
from one technology to the other
as we pursue our own individual lifestyles.
