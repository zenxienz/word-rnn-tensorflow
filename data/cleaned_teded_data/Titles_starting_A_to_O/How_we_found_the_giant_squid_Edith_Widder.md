the Kraken a beast so terrifying it was
said to devour men and ships and Wales
and so enormous it could be mistaken for
an island in assessing the merits of
such tales it&#39;s probably wise to keep in
mind that old sailors saw that the only
difference between a fairy tale and a
sea story is a fairy tale begins once
upon a time and a sea story begins this
ain&#39;t no every fish that gets away
grows with every telling of the tale
nevertheless there are giants in the
ocean and we now have video proof as
those of you that saw the discovery
channel documentary are no doubt aware I
was one of the three scientists on this
expedition that took place last summer
off Japan I&#39;m the short one the other
two are dr. sunni mokuba dara and dr.
Steve O&#39;Shea I owe my participation in
this now historic event to Ted in 2010
there was a Ted event called mission
blue held aboard the Lindblad Explorer
in the Galapagos as part of the
fulfillment of Sylvia earls Ted wish I
spoke about a new way of exploring the
ocean one that focuses on attracting
animals instead of scaring them away
Mike deGruy was also invited and he
spoke with great passion about his love
of the ocean and he also talked to me
about applying my approach to something
he&#39;s been involved with for a very long
time which is the hunt for the giant
squid it was Mike that got me invited to
the squid summit a gathering of squid
experts at the discovery channel that
summer during Shark Week I gave a talk
on unobtrusive viewing an optical luring
of deep-sea squid in which I emphasized
the importance of using quiet
unobtrusive platforms for exploration
this came out of hundreds of dives I
have made farting around in the dark
using these platforms and my impression
that I saw more animals working from the
submersible than I did with either of
the remote
braided vehicles but that could just be
because the submersible has a wider
field of view but I also felt like I saw
more animals working with the tiburon
and the van tana two vehicles with the
same field of view but different
propulsion systems so my suspicion was
that it might have something to do with
the amount of noise they made so I set
up a hydrophone on the bottom of the
ocean and I had each of these fly by at
the same speed and distance and recorded
the sound they made the Johnson ceiling
which you&#39;ve been probably just barely
hear here uses electric thrusters very
very quiet the tiburon also uses
electric powered thrusters it&#39;s also
pretty quiet but a bit noisier but most
deep diving or obese these days use
hydraulics and they sound like the
Ventana I think that&#39;s got to be scaring
a lot of animals away so for the
deep-sea squid hunt I proposed using an
optical lure attached to a camera
platform with no thrusters no motors
just a battery-powered camera and the
only illumination coming from red light
that&#39;s invisible to most deep sea
animals that are adapted to see
primarily blue that&#39;s visible to our eye
but it&#39;s the equivalent of infrared in
the deep sea so this camera platform
which we called the Medusa could just be
throwing off the back of the ship
attached to a float at the surface with
over 2,000 feet of line it would just
float around passively carried by the
currents and the only light visible to
the animals in the deep would be the
blue light of the optical or which we
call the electronic jellyfish or a jelly
because it was designed to imitate the
bioluminescent display of the common
deep-sea jellyfish at Ola now this
pinwheel of light that the attalla
produces is known as a bioluminescent
burglar alarm and it&#39;s a form of Defense
the reason that the electronic jellyfish
worked as a lure is not because giant
squid a jellyfish but it&#39;s because this
jellyfish only resorts to producing this
light when it&#39;s being chewed on by
a predator and its only hope for escape
maybe to attract the attention of a
larger predator that will attack its
attacker and thereby afforded an
opportunity for escape it&#39;s a scream for
help a latch dished attempt for escape
and a common form of defense in the deep
sea the approach worked whereas all
previous expeditions had failed to
garner a single video glimpse of the
giant we managed six and the first
triggered wild excitement oh my god just
hanging yes it was like it was teasing
us doing a kind of fan dance now you see
me now you don&#39;t and we had for such
teasing appearances and then on the
fifth it came in and totally wowed us
can
The Full Monty what really wowed me
about that was the way it came in up
over the e jelly and then attacked the
enormous thing next to it which I think
it mistook for the predator on the e
jelly but even more incredible was the
footage shot from the Triton submersible
what was not mentioned in the discovery
documentary was that the bait squid that
dr. kubodera used a one meter long
Diamondbacks squid had a light attached
to it a squid jig of the type that
longline fishermen use and I think it
was this light that brought the giant in
now what you&#39;re seeing is the
intensified cameras view under red light
and that&#39;s all dr. kubodera could see
when the giant comes in here and then he
got so excited he turned on his
flashlight if he wanted to see better
and the giant didn&#39;t run away so he
risks turning on the white lights on the
submersible bringing a creature of
legend from the misty history into high
resolution video it was absolutely
breathtaking and had this animal had its
feeding tentacles intact and fully
extended it would have been as tall as a
two-story house how could something that
big live in our ocean and yet remain
unfilmed until now we&#39;ve only explored
about five percent of our ocean there
are great discoveries yet to be made
down there fantastic creatures
representing millions of years of
evolution possibly bioactive compounds
that could benefit us in ways that we
can&#39;t even yet imagine yet we have spent
only a tiny fraction of the money on
ocean exploration that we&#39;ve spent on
space exploration we need a NASA like
organization for ocean exploration
because we need to be exploring and
protecting our life-support systems here
on earth we need thank you
exploration is the engine that drives
innovation innovation drives economic
growth so let&#39;s all go exploring but
let&#39;s do it in a way that doesn&#39;t scare
the animals away or as Mike deGruy once
said if you want to get away from it all
and see something you&#39;ve never seen or
have an excellent chance of seeing
something that no one&#39;s ever seen
getting a sub he should have been with
us for this admit adventure we miss him
