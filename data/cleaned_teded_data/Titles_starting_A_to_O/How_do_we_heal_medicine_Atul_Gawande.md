I got my start in writing and research
as a surgical training as someone who
was a long ways away from becoming any
kind of an expert at anything so the
natural question you ask then at that
point is how do I get good at what I&#39;m
trying to do and it became a question of
how do we all get good at what we&#39;re
trying to do it&#39;s hard enough to learn
to get the skills try to learn all the
material you have to absorb it any task
you&#39;re taking on I had to think about
how I sew and how I cut but then also
how I picked the right person to come to
an operating room and then in the midst
of all this came this new context for
thinking about what it meant to be good
in the last few years we realized we&#39;re
in the deepest crisis of Medicine&#39;s
existence due to something you don&#39;t
normally think about when you&#39;re a
doctor concerned with how you do good
for people which is the cost of health
care there&#39;s not a country in the world
that now is not asking whether we can
afford what doctors do the political
fight that we&#39;ve developed has become
one around whether it&#39;s the government
that&#39;s the problem or is it insurance
companies that are the problem and the
answer is yes and no it&#39;s deeper than
all of that the cause of our troubles is
actually the complexity that science has
given us in order to understand this I&#39;m
gonna take you back a couple of
generations I want to take you back to a
time when Lewis Thomas was writing in
his book the youngest science Lewis
Thomas was a physician writer one of my
one of my favorite writers and he wrote
this book to explain among other things
what it was like to be a medical intern
at the Boston City Hospital in the pre
penicillin year of 1937
it was a time when medicine was cheap
and very ineffective if you were in a
hospital he said it was gonna do you
good only because it offered you some
warmth some food shelter and maybe the
caring attention of a nurse doctors and
medicine made no difference at all that
didn&#39;t seem to prevent the doctors from
being frantically busy in their days as
he explained what they were trying to do
was figure out whether you might have
one of the diagnoses for which they
could do something and there were a few
you might have a lobar pneumonia for
example and they could give you an
antiserum an injection of rabbit
antibodies to the bacterium
streptococcus if the intern sub typed it
correctly if you had an acute congestive
heart failure they could bleed a
plaintiff blood from you by opening up
an arm vein giving you a crude leaf
preparation of digitalis and then giving
you oxygen by tent if you had early
signs of paralysis and you were really
good at asking personal questions you
might figure out that this paralysis
someone has is from syphilis in which
case you could give this nice concoction
of mercury and arsenic as long as you
didn&#39;t overdose them and kill them
beyond these sorts of things a medical
doctor didn&#39;t have a lot that they could
do this was when the core structure of
medicine was created what would it meant
to be good at what we did and and how we
wanted to build medicine to be it was at
a time when what was known you could
know you could hold it all in your head
and you could do it all if you had a
prescription pad if you had a nurse if
you had a hospital that would give you a
place to convalesce maybe some basic
tools you
really could do it all you set the
fracture you drew the blood you spun the
blood it looked at it under the
microscope you plated the culture you&#39;ve
injected the antiserum this was a life
as a craftsman as a result we built it
around a culture and set of values that
said what you were good at was being
daring at being courageous at being
independent and self-sufficient autonomy
was our highest valued go a couple
generations forward to where we are
though and it looks like a completely
different world we have now found
treatments for nearly all of the tens of
thousands of conditions that a human
being can have we can&#39;t cure it all we
can&#39;t guarantee that everybody will live
a long and healthy life
but we can make it possible for most but
what does it take we&#39;ll we&#39;ve now
discovered 4,000 medical and surgical
procedures we&#39;ve discovered 6,000 drugs
that I&#39;m now licensed to prescribe and
we&#39;re trying to deploy this capability
town by town to every person alive in
our own country let alone around the
world and we&#39;ve reached the point where
we&#39;ve realized as doctors we can&#39;t know
it all we can&#39;t do it all by ourselves
there was a study where they looked at
how many clinicians it took to take care
of you if you came into a hospital as it
changed over time and in the year 1970
it took just over two full-time
equivalents of clinicians that is to say
it took basically the nursing time and
then just a little bit of time for a
doctor who more or less checked in on
you once a day by the end of the 20th
century it had become more than 15
clinicians for the
same typical hospital patient
specialists physical therapists the
nurses we&#39;re all specialists now even
the primary care physicians everyone
just has a piece of the care but holding
on to that structure we built around the
daring independence self-sufficiency of
each of those people it&#39;s become a
disaster we have trained hired and
rewarded people to be Cowboys but it&#39;s
pit crews that we need pit crews for
patients there&#39;s evidence all around us
40% of our coronary artery disease
patients in our communities receive
incomplete or inappropriate care 60% of
our asthma stroke patients receive
incomplete or inappropriate care two
million people come into hospitals and
pick up an infection they didn&#39;t have
because someone failed to follow the
basic practices of hygiene our
experience as people who get sick need
help from other people is that we have
amazing clinicians that we can turn to
hard-working incredibly well trained
very smart that we have access to
incredible technologies that give us
great hope the little sense that it
consistently all comes together for you
from start to finish in a successful way
there&#39;s another sign that we need pit
crews and that&#39;s the unmanageable cost
of our care now we in medicine I think
are baffled by this question of cost we
want to say this is just the way it is
this is just what medicine requires when
you go from a world where you treated
arthritis with aspirin that mostly
didn&#39;t do the job
to one where if it gets bad enough we
can do a hip replacement a knee
replacement that gives you years maybe
decades without disability a dramatic
change well is it any surprise that that
forty thousand dollar hip replacement
replacing that the ten cent aspirin is
is more expensive it&#39;s just the way it
is but I think we&#39;re ignoring certain
facts that tell us something about what
we can do as we&#39;ve looked at the data
about the results that have come as the
complexity of increased we found that
the most expensive care is not
necessarily the best care and vice versa
the best care often turns out to be the
least expensive it has fewer
complications the people get more
efficient at what they do and what that
means is there&#39;s hope because to have
the best results you really needed the
most expensive care in the country or in
the world well then we really would be
talking about rationing who we&#39;re gonna
cut off a Medicare that would be really
our only choice but when we look at the
positive deviance the ones who are
getting the best results at the lowest
costs we find the ones that look most
like systems are the most successful
that is to say they found ways to get
all of the different pieces all of the
different components to come together
into a whole having great components is
not enough and yet we&#39;ve been obsessed
in medicine with components we want the
best drugs the best technologies the
best specialists but we don&#39;t think too
much about how it all comes together
it&#39;s a terrible design strategy actually
if you well there&#39;s a famous thought
experiment that touches exactly on this
they said what if you built a car from
the very best
our parts well it would lead you to put
in Porsche brakes a Ferrari engine a
Volvo body a BMW chassis and you put it
all together and what do you get a very
expensive pile of junk that does not go
anywhere and that is what medicine can
feel like sometimes it&#39;s not a system
now a system however when things start
to come together you realize it has
certain skills for acting and looking
that way skill number one is the ability
to recognize success and the ability to
recognize failure when you are a
specialist you can&#39;t see the end result
very well you have to become really
interested in data unsexy as that sounds
one of my colleagues is a surgeon in
Cedar Rapids Iowa and he got interested
in the question of well how many CT
scans did they do for their community in
Cedar Rapids he got interested in this
because there&#39;d been government reports
newspaper reports a journal article
saying that there&#39;d been too many CT
scans done you didn&#39;t see it in his own
patients and so he asked the question
how many did we do and he wanted to get
the data
it took him three months no one had
asked this question in his community
before and what he found was that for
the 300,000 people in their community in
the previous year they had done 52,000
CT scans they had found a problem which
brings us to skill number two a system
has skill one find weather where your
failures are skill two is devise
solutions I got interested in this when
the World Health Organization came to my
team asking if we could help with a
project to reduce deaths in surgery the
volume of surgery had spread around the
world but the safety of surgery had not
now our usual tactics for tackling
problems like these are to do more
training give people more specialization
or bring in more technology well in
surgery you couldn&#39;t have people who are
more specialized and you couldn&#39;t have
people who are better trained and yet we
see unconscionable levels of death
disability that could be avoided and so
we looked at what other high-risk
industries do we looked at skyscraper
construction we looked at the aviation
world and we found that they have
technology they have training and then
they have one other thing they have
checklists I did not expect to be
spending a significant part of my time
as a Harvard surgeon worrying about
checklist and yet what we found were
that these were tools to help make
experts better we got the lead safety
engineer for Boeing to help us could we
design a checklist for surgery not for
the lowest people on a tunnel before the
folks who were all the way around the
chain the entire team including the
surgeons and what they taught us was
that designing a checklist to help
people handle complexity actually
involves more difficulty than I had
understood you have to think about
things like pause points you need to
identify the moments in a process when
you can actually catch a problem before
it&#39;s a danger and do something about it
you have to identify that this is a
before takeoff checklist and then you
need to focus on the killer items an
aviation checklist like this one for a
single-engine plane isn&#39;t a recipe for
how to fly a plane it&#39;s a reminder of
the key things that get forgotten or
missed if they&#39;re not checked so we did
this we created a 19 item 2-minute
checklist for surgical teams we had the
pause points immediately before
anesthesia is given immediately before
the knife hits the skin immediately
before the patient leaves the room
and we had a mix of dumb stuff on there
making sure an antibiotic is given in
the right time frame because that cuts
the infection rate by half and then
interesting stuff because you can&#39;t make
a recipe for something as complicated as
surgery instead you can make a recipe
for how to have a team that&#39;s prepared
for the unexpected and we had items like
making sure everyone in the room had
introduced themselves by name at the
start of the day because you have half a
dozen people or more who are sometimes
coming together as a team for the very
first time that day that you&#39;re coming
in we implemented this checklist in
eight hospitals around the world
deliberately in places from rural
Tanzania to the University of Washington
in Seattle we found that after they
adopted it the the complication rates
fell thirty five percent it fell in
every hospital it went into the death
rates fell forty seven percent this was
bigger than a drug
and that brings us to skill number three
the ability to implement this to get
colleagues across the entire chain to
actually do these things and it&#39;s been
slow to spread this is not yet our
norman surgery let alone making
checklists to go on to child births and
other areas there&#39;s a deep resistance
because using these tools forces us to
confront that we&#39;re not a system forces
us to behave with a different set of
values just using a checklist requires
you to embrace different values from
ones we&#39;ve had like humility discipline
teamwork this is the opposite of what we
were built on independence
self-sufficiency autonomy I met an
actual cowboy by the way I asked him
what was it like to actually you know
heard a thousand cattle across hundreds
of miles how did you do that and he said
we have the Cowboys station that
distinct places all around they
communicate electronically constantly
and they have protocols and checklists
for how they handle everything from
bad weather two emergencies or
inoculations for the cattle even the
Cowboys or pit crews now and it seemed
like time that we become that way
ourselves making systems work is the
great task of my generation of
physicians and scientists but I would go
further and say that making systems work
whether in health care education climate
change making a pathway out of poverty
is the great task of our generation as a
whole in every field knowledge has
exploded but it has brought complexity
it has brought specialization and we&#39;ve
come to a place where we have no choice
but to recognize as individualistic as
we want to be complexity requires group
success we all need to be pit crews now
thank you
