I think I was supposed to talk about my
new book which is called blink and it&#39;s
about snap judgments and first
impressions and it comes out in January
and I hope you all buy it in triplicate
but I was thinking about this and I
realized it my that although my new book
makes me happy and I think will make my
mother happy it&#39;s not really about
happiness
so I decided instead I would talk about
someone who I think has done as much to
make Americans happy as perhaps anyone
over the last 20 years a man who is a
great personal hero of mine someone by
the name of Howard Moskowitz who is most
famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce
Howard is heard about this high and he&#39;s
round and he&#39;s in his 60s and he has big
huge glasses and thinning gray hair and
he has a kind of wonderful exuberance
and vitality and he keeps her as a
parrot and he loves the Opera and he&#39;s
of great aficionado of medieval history
and here by profession he&#39;s as like a
physicist now I should tell you that I
have no idea what psychophysics is
although at some point of my life I
dated a girl for two years who was
getting her doctorate in psychophysics
we should tell you something about that
relationship but Howard as far as I know
second physics is about measuring things
and Howard is very interested in
measuring things and he graduated with
his doctor from Harvard and he set up a
little consulting shop in White Plains
New York and one of his first clients
was this is many years ago back in the
early 70s one of his first clients was
Pepsi and Pepsi came to Howard and they
said you know we there&#39;s this new thing
called aspartame and we would like to
make Diet Pepsi
we&#39;d like you to figure out how much
aspartame we should put in each can of
Diet Pepsi in order to have the perfect
drink now that sounds like an incredibly
straightforward question to answer and
that&#39;s what Howard thought because Pepsi
told them look we&#39;re working with a band
between 8 and 12 percent
anything below 8% sweetness is not sweet
enough anything above 12% sweetness is
too sweet we want to know what&#39;s the
sweet spot between 8 and 12 now if I
gave you this problem to do you would
all say it&#39;s very simple what we do is
you make up a big experimental batch of
Pepsi at every degree of sweetness eight
percent eight point one eight point two
eight point three all the way up to
twelve and we try this out with
thousands of people and we plot the
results on a curve and we take the most
popular concentration right really
simple Howard does the experiment and he
gets the data bat and he plots it on a
curve and all of a sudden he realizes
it&#39;s not a nice spell curve in fact data
doesn&#39;t make any sense it&#39;s a mess it&#39;s
all over the place now most people in
that business in the world of testing
food and such are not dismayed when the
data comes back a mess they think well
you know figuring out what people think
about coal is not that easy
you know maybe we made an error of
somewhere along the way you know let&#39;s
just make an educated guess and they
simply point and they go for ten percent
right in the middle Howard is not so
easily placated Howard is a man of
certain degree of intellectual standards
and this was not good enough for him and
he this question bedeviled him for years
and he would think it do and say what
was wrong why could we not make sense of
this experiment with dyed Pepsi and one
day he was sitting in a diner in White
Plains about to go trying to dream up
some work for Nescafe and suddenly like
a bolt of lightning the answer came to
him and that is that when they analyzed
the dye Pepsi data they were asking the
wrong question they were looking for the
perfect Pepsi and they should have been
looking for the perfect Pepsi&#39;s trust me
this was an enormous revelation this was
one of the most brilliant breakthroughs
in all of food science and how it
immediately went on the road and he
would go to conferences around the
country Andy would stand up and even say
you had been looking for the perfect
Pepsi you&#39;re wrong you should be looking
for the perfect Pepsi&#39;s people would
look at him with a blank look and they
would say what are you talking about
craziness and they would say you know
move next try to get business nobody
would hire him he was obsessed though
and he talked about it and talked about
who talked about it Howard loves the
Yiddish
expression to a Worman horseradish the
world is horseradish this was his
horseradish he was obsessed with it and
finally he had a breakthrough Vlasic
pickles came to him and they said mr.
Moskowitz dr. Moscowitz we want to make
the perfect pickle and he said there is
no perfect pickle there are only perfect
pickles and he came back to them and he
said you don&#39;t just need to improve your
regular you need to create zesty and
that&#39;s where we got zesty pickles then
the next person came to him and that was
Campbell&#39;s soup this was even more
important in fact Campbell&#39;s soup is
where Howard made his reputation
Campbell&#39;s made prego and prego in the
early 80s was struggling next to ragu
which was the dominant spaghetti sauce
of the 70s and 80s now in the industry
don&#39;t know whether you care about this
or how much time I have to go into this
but it was technically speaking this is
an aside prego is a better tomato sauce
than ragu the quality of the tomato
paste is much better the spice mix is
far superior it adheres to the pasta in
a much more pleasing way in fact they
would do the famous bowl test back in
the 70s with rag with ragu and prego
you&#39;d have a plate of spaghetti and you
would pour it on right and the ragu
would all go to the bottom and the prego
would sit on top that&#39;s called adherence
and anyway despite the fact that they
were far superior in adherence and the
quality of their tomato paste prego was
struggling so they came to Howard and
they said fix us and Howard looked at
their product line he said what you have
is a dead potatoes Society of dead
tomatoes Society so he said this is what
I want to do and he got together with
the Campbell&#39;s soup kitchen and he made
45 varieties of spaghetti sauce and he
varied them according to every
conceivable way that you can vary tomato
sauce by sweetness by level of garlic by
tartness by sourness by tomato enos by
visible solids my favorite term and
getting sauce business every conceivable
way you can vary spaghetti sauce he
varied spaghetti sauce and then he took
this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces
and he went on the road he went to New
York he went to Chicago he went to
Jacksonville he went to Los Angeles and
he brought in people by the truckload
into big hauls and he sat them down for
two hours and he gave them over the
course of that two hours ten bowls ten
small bowls of pasta with a different
spaghetti sauce on each one and after
they ate each Bowl they had to rate from
zero to 100 how good they thought the
spaghetti sauce was at the end of that
process after doing it for months and
months he had a mountain of data about
how the American people feel about
spaghetti sauce and then he analyzed the
data now did he look for the most
popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce
no Howard doesn&#39;t believe that there is
such a thing instead he looked at the
data and he said let&#39;s see if we can
group these different all these
different data points into clusters
let&#39;s see if they congregate around
certain ideas and sure enough if you sit
down and you analyze these all this data
on spaghetti sauce you realize that all
Americans fall into one of three groups
there are people who like their
spaghetti sauce plain there are people
who like their spaghetti sauce spicy and
there are people who like it extra
chunky and of those three facts the
third one was the most significant
because at the time in nearly 1980s if
he went to a supermarket you would not
find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and
prego turned to Howard and I said are
you telling me that one-third of
Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti
sauce and yet no one is servicing their
needs and he said yes
and prego then went back and completely
reformulated their spaghetti sauce and
came out with a line of extra-chunky
that immediately and completely took
over the spaghetti sauce business in
this country and over the next 10 years
they made 600 million dollars off their
line of extra-chunky sauces and everyone
else in the industry looked at what
Howard and done it and they said oh my
god we&#39;ve been thinking all wrong and
that&#39;s when you started to get seven
different kinds of vinegar and 14
different kinds of mustard and 71
different kinds of olive oil and then
eventually even ragu hired Howard and
Howard did the exact same thing for ragu
that he did for prego and today if you
go to the supermarket a really good one
you look at how many ragu there are dude
oh how many they are thirty-six in six
varieties cheese light robusta rich and
hearty old-world traditional
extra-chunky
garden that&#39;s Howard&#39;s doing that is
Howard&#39;s gift to the American people now
why is that important
it is in fact enormous ly important I&#39;ll
explain to you why because what Howard
did is he fundamentally changed the way
the food industry thinks about making
you happy
assumption number one in the food
industry used to be that the way to find
out what people want to eat what will
make people happy is to ask them and for
years and years and years and years
Raghu and prego would have focus groups
and they would sit all you people down
and they would say what do you want in a
spaghetti sauce tell us what you wanted
to get e sauce for all those years
20-30 years do all those phyllis group
sessions no one ever said they wanted
extra-chunky even though at least a
third of them deep in their hearts
actually did people don&#39;t know what they
want right as howard loves to say the
mind knows not what the tongue wants
it&#39;s a mystery and they court in a
critically important step in
understanding our own desires and tastes
is to realize that we cannot always
explain what we want deep down if I
asked all of you for example in this
room what you wanted a coffee you know
what you&#39;d say everyone of you would say
I want a dark rich hearty roast so
people always say when you asked Milly
want in a coffee what do you like dark
rich hearty roast
what percentage of you actually like a
dark rich hearty roast
according to Howard somewhere between 25
and 27% of you most of you like milky
weak coffee but you will never ever say
to someone who asks you what she wanted
I want a milky weak coffee
so that&#39;s number one thing that Howard
did number two thing that Howard did is
he made us realize it&#39;s another very
critical point he made us realize in the
importance of what he likes to call
horizontal segmentation why is this
critical it&#39;s critical because this is
the way the food industry thought before
Howard right
what were they obsessed with in the
early eighties they were obsessed with
mustard in particularly are obsessed
with the story of great burp all right
used to be there were two mustards
French&#39;s and gold&#39;s what were they
yellow mustard what&#39;s in yellow mustard
yellow mustard seeds turmeric and
paprika
that was mustard Grey Poupon came along
with a Dijon right much more evaldo
brown mustard seed some white wine a
nose hid much more delicate aromatics
and what did they do they put it in a
little tiny glass jar with wonderful
enameled label on it may it look French
even though it&#39;s made in Oxnard
California and instead of charging a
dollar 50 for the 8 ounce can the way
the dry-towns bottle the way that
French&#39;s and Gulden&#39;s did they decided
to charge four dollars and then they had
those ads right with a guy in the Rolls
Royce and he&#39;s eating the Grey Poupon
other rolls-royce pulls up but he says
do you have any Grey Poupon and the
whole thing after they did that Grey
Poupon takes off he takes over the
mustard business and everyone&#39;s
take-home lesson from that was that the
way to get to make people happy is to
give them something that is more
expensive something to aspire to right
is to make them turn their back on what
they like think they like now and reach
out for something higher up the mustard
hierarchy a better mustard a more
expensive mustard a mustard a boar
sophistication and culture and meaning
and Howard looked at that and said
that&#39;s wrong master does not exist on a
hierarchy mustard exists just like
tomato sauce on a horizontal plane there
is no good mustard or bad mustard there
is no perfect mustard or imperfect
mustard there are only different kinds
of mustards that suit different kinds of
people he fundamentally democratized the
way we think about taste and for that as
well we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge
of thanks third thing that Howard did
and perhaps the most important is Howard
confronted the notion of the Platonic
dish what do I mean by that for the
longest time in the food industry there
was a sense that there was one way a
perfect way to make a dish you go to
Chez Panisse they give you the red tail
sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a
something-something reduction they don&#39;t
give you five options on the reduction
right they don&#39;t say do you want the
extra chunky reduction or do you want
the no you just get the reduction why
because the chef at Chez Panisse has the
Platonic notion about red tail sashimi
this is the way it ought to be and when
that you know and she serves it that way
time and time again and if you quarrel
with her she will say you know what
you&#39;re wrong this is the best way it
ought to be in this restaurant now that
same idea fueled the commercial food
industry as well
they had a notion a platonic notion of
what tomato sauce was and where did that
come from it came from Italy Italian
tomato sauce is what it&#39;s blended it&#39;s
thin the culture of tomato sauce was
thin when we talked about authentic
tomato sauce in the 1970s we talked
about Italian tomato sauce we talked
about the earliest raghu&#39;s which had no
visible solids right which were thin you
just put a little bit over there and it
sunk down to the bottom of the pasta
that&#39;s what it was and why will we
attach that because we thought that what
it took to make people happy
was to provide them with the most
culturally authentic tomato sauce a B
and B we thought that if we gave them
the culturally authentic tomato sauce
then they would embrace it and that&#39;s
what would please the maximum number of
people and Howard and the reason we
thought that other words people in the
cooking world were looking for cooking
universals they were looking for one way
to treat all of us and it&#39;s good reason
for them to be obsessed with the idea of
universals because all of science
through the 19th century and much of the
20th was obsessed with universals
psychologists medical scientists
economics economists were all interested
in finding out the rules that govern the
way all of us behave
but that changed right yes what is the
great revolution in science of the last
10-15 years it is the movement from the
search for universals to the
understanding of variability now in
medical science we don&#39;t want to know
how necessarily just how cancer works we
want to know how your cancer is
different from my cancer
I guess my cancer is different your
cancer we&#39;re interested in genetics has
opened the door to the study of human
variability what Howard Moskowitz was
doing was saying this same revolution
needs to happen in the world of tomato
sauce and for that we owe him a great
vote of thanks I&#39;ll give you one last
illustration of variability and that is
and I&#39;m sorry Howard not only believe
that but even took it a second step
which was to say that when we pursue
universal principles in food we are just
making an error we are actually doing
ourselves a massive disservice an
example he used was coffee and coffee is
something he did a lot of work with with
Nescafe if I were to ask all of you to
try and come up with a brand of coffee a
type of coffee a brew that made all of
you happy and then I asked you to rate
that coffee
the average score in this room for
coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0
to 100 if however you allowed me to
break you into cost coffee clusters
maybe three or four copy clusters and I
could make coffee just from one of those
for each of those individual clusters
your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78
the difference between coffee at 60 and
coffee at 78 is the difference between
coffee that makes you wince and coffee
that makes you deliriously happy that is
the final I think most beautiful lesson
of Howard Moskowitz that in embracing
the diversity of human beings we will
find a sure way to true happiness
you
