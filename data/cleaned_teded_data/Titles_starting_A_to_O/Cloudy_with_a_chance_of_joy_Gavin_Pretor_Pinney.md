clouds we&#39;ve noticed how much people
moan about them they get bad rap if you
think about it the English language has
written into it negative associations
towards the clouds someone who&#39;s down or
depressed they&#39;re under a cloud and when
there&#39;s bad news in store there&#39;s a
cloud on the horizon I saw an article
the other day it was about problems with
computer processing over the Internet a
cloud over the cloud was a headline it
seems like they&#39;re everyone&#39;s default
doom and gloom metaphor but I think
they&#39;re beautiful don&#39;t you it&#39;s just
that their beauty is missed because
they&#39;re so omnipresent so I don&#39;t know
commonplace that people don&#39;t notice
them they don&#39;t know who&#39;s the beauty
where they don&#39;t even notice the clouds
unless they get in the way of the Sun
and so people think of clouds as the
things are getting away they think of
them as the annoying frustrating
obstructions and then they rush off and
do some blue sky thinking but most
people when you stop to ask them will
admit to harboring a strange sort of
fondness for clouds it&#39;s like a
nostalgic fondness and they make them
think of their youth who here can&#39;t
remember thinking while looking and
finding shapes in the clouds when they
were kids you know when you were masters
of daydreaming Aristophanes the ancient
Greek playwright he described the clouds
as the patron goddesses of idle fellows
doing a half thousand years ago and you
can see what he means it&#39;s just that
these days us adults seem reluctant to
allow ourselves the indulgence of just
allowing our imaginations to drift along
in the breeze and I think that&#39;s a pity
I think we should perhaps do a bit more
of it
it should be a bit more willing perhaps
to look at the beautiful sight of the
sunlight bursting out from behind the
clouds and go wait a minute there&#39;s two
cats dancing the salsa for seeing the
big so seeing the the big white puffy
one up there over the shopping center
looks like the abominable snowman going
to rob a bank they&#39;re like nature&#39;s
version of those ink blot images you
know that shrinks used to show their
patients in the 60s and I think if you
consider the shapes you see in the
clouds will save money on psychoanalysis
bills let&#39;s say you&#39;re in love all right
then you look up and what do you see
right or maybe the opposite you&#39;ve just
been dumped by your partner and and
everywhere you look it&#39;s kissing couples
perhaps you&#39;re having a moment of
existential angst new you&#39;re thinking
about your own mortality and there on
the horizon it&#39;s the Grim Reaper
or maybe you see a topless sunbathe what
would that mean what would that mean I
have no idea but one thing I do know is
this the bad press that clouds get is
totally unfair I think we should stand
up for them which is why a few years ago
I started the cloud appreciation society
tens of thousands of members now in
almost 100 countries around the world
and all these photographs that the
center that I&#39;m showing they were sent
in by members and the Society exists to
remind people of this clouds are not
something to moan about far from it they
are in fact the most diverse evocative
poetic aspect of nature I think if you
live with your head in the clouds every
now and then it helps you keep your feet
on the ground and i want to show you why
with the help of some of my favorite
types of cloud let&#39;s start with this one
it&#39;s the cirrus cloud named after the
latin for a lock of hair it&#39;s composed
entirely of ice crystals cascading from
the upper reaches of the troposphere and
as these ice crystals fall they pass
through different layers with different
wins and they speed up and slow down
giving the clarity&#39;s brushstroke
appearances these brushstroke forms
known as full streaks and these winds up
there can be very very fierce there can
be two hundred miles an hour three
hundred miles an hour these clouds are
bombing along but from all the way down
here they appear to me moving gracefully
slowly like most clouds and so to tune
into the clouds as to slow down to calm
down it&#39;s like a bit of every day
meditation those are common clouds what
about rarer ones like the lenticular
asst the ufo-shaped lenticular Ascar
these clouds form in the region of
mountains when the wind passes rises to
pass over the mountain it can take on a
wave-like path in the Lee of the peak
with these crowds hovering at the crest
of these invisible standing waves of air
these flying saucer-like forms and some
of the early black and white UFO photos
are in fact then ticular escribe
it&#39;s true little rarer are the full
streak holes right this is when a layer
is made up of very very cold water
droplets and in one region they start to
freeze and this freezing sets off a
chain reaction which spreads outwards
with the ice crystals cascading and
falling down below even the appearance
of jellyfish tendrils down below rare is
still the Kelvin Helmholtz cloud not a
very snappy name need to rebrand the
this looks like a series of breaking
waves and it&#39;s caused by shearing winds
that wind above the cloud layer and
below the cloud layer differ
significantly and in the middle in
between you get this undulating of the
air and if the difference in those
speeds is just right the tops of the
undulations curl over in these beautiful
breaking wave like vortices now those
are rarer clouds than the Cirrus but
they&#39;re not that rare if you look up you
pay attention to the sky you&#39;ll see them
sooner or later maybe not quite as
dramatic as these but you&#39;ll see them
and you&#39;ll see them around where you
live clouds are the most egalitarian of
nature&#39;s displays because we all have a
good fantastic view of the sky these
clouds these rare are clouds remind us
that the exotic can be found in the
everyday not it&#39;s more nourishing more
stimulating to an active inquiring mind
than being surprised being amazed it&#39;s
why we&#39;re all here at Ted right but you
don&#39;t need to rush off away from the
familiar across the world to be
surprised it isn&#39;t to step outside pay
attention to watch so commonplace so
everyday so mundane that everybody else
misses it one glad that people rarely
miss is this one the cumulonimbus storm
cloud alright what produces thunder and
lightning and hail these cards spread
out at the top in this enormous anvil
fashion stretching ten miles up into the
atmosphere they are an expression of the
majestic architecture of our atmosphere
but from down below they are the
embodiment of the powerful elemental
force and power that drives our
atmosphere to be there is
be connected in the driving rain and the
hail to feel connected to our atmosphere
is to be reminded that we are creatures
that inhabit this ocean of air we don&#39;t
live beneath the sky we live within it
and that connection that visceral
connection to our atmosphere feels to me
like an antidote it&#39;s an antidote to the
growing tendency we have to feel that we
can really ever experience life by
watching it on a computer screen you
know when we&#39;re in a Wi-Fi zone but the
one cloud that best expresses why cloud
spotting is more valuable today than
ever is this one the cumulus cloud right
forms on a sunny day if you close your
eyes and think of a cloud it&#39;s probably
one of these that comes to mind all
those cloud shapes at the beginning
those were cumulus clouds the sharp
crisp outlines of this formation make it
the best one for finding shapes in and
it reminds us of the aimless nature of
cloud spotting what an aimless activity
it is you&#39;re not going to change the
world by lying on your back and gazing
up at the sky are you this pointless
it&#39;s a pointless activity which is
precisely why it&#39;s so important
the the digital world conspires to make
us feel eternally busy perpetually busy
you know when you&#39;re not dealing with
the traditional pressures of earning a
living putting food on the table raising
a family writing thank you letters you
have to now contend with answering a
mountain of unanswered emails updating a
Facebook page feeding your twitter feed
and cloud spotting legitimizes doing
nothing and sometimes we need sometimes
we need excuses to do nothing we need to
be reminded by these patron goddesses of
idol fellows that slowing down and being
in the present not thinking about what
you&#39;ve got to do what you should have
done but just being here letting your
imagination lift from the everyday
concerns down here and just being in the
present it&#39;s good for you it&#39;s good for
the way you feel is good for your ideas
it&#39;s good for your creativity it&#39;s good
for your soul so keep looking up marvel
at the ephemeral beauty and always
remember to live life with your head in
the clouds thank you very much
you
