In my case it&#39;s a little bit different
because I think, probably, my parenting experience
associated with my work experience
becomes probably one of the leading elements
of my life.
Trying to balance a job that is very demanding
in terms of intensive traveling
and having a family and a home
that is also very demanding
with some little comments
coming from a seven-year-old daughter
are often something that makes me think
if I&#39;m always doing the right things,
if I&#39;m getting the right balance
between the effort I&#39;m putting in my job,
which I&#39;m very passionate about,
and a family that I love very much.
But in the end, what is the right place
and where am I making excuses
to try to make the most out of the other side?
So, it&#39;s always an interesting subject,
something that is very challenging.
And every time I hear one of my fellows here
talking about the subject,
I&#39;m very intrigued
because I try to get ideas
on how they are coping with a subject
that is probably a big and important one
for many of us,
especially as you move up in positions
that give you a lot of responsibilities,
but with responsibilities,
you also get this,
let&#39;s say, downside.
