Who do you look up to?
I definitely look up to people
who are being very good mentors in my career,
in different companies,
in previous experiences.
So, today, like I did in the past,
always people that were very truthful to their principles,
people who were very willing to teach,
to give ideas,
that were, really,
I think people who really understood
that being a good manager
is not about being able to develop good work,
but it&#39;s about developing good resources.
So, I think one of the biggest achievements for a manager
is not so much reaching your goals
in terms of objectives and budgets,
but really the ability to develop a good team.
To develop resources is something that is invaluable.
Nowadays, talents are something difficult to find
and difficult to retain.
And so, if you have a manager
that is highly successful in this role,
I think you have a person
who is really valuable to an organization.
