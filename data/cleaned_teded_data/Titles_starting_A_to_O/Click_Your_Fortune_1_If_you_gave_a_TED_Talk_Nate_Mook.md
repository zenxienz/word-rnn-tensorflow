I would talk about a younger generation that&#39;s coming up
that will build a community
that&#39;s not based around nation states
and based around limiting
and creating divides between people.
I would sort of look towards building a community
that&#39;s one that has a,
recognizes their shared future together
and really can work together to build that.
Whether they&#39;re from, you know,
the slums of Kibera in Nairobi
or from big cities like London
or, you know, rural United States,
you know, I think we&#39;re all one people,
and we can all work together,
and so I would really talk about how
that&#39;s what needs,
that&#39;s what the world needs right now.
We need to recognize
that we have far more in common
than we do have differences.
