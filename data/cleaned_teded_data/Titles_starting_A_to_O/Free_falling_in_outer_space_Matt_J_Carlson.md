Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool,
all comfy and warm, thinking,
&quot;Man, it&#39;d be cool to be an astronaut!
You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything.
It&#39;d be so neat!&quot;
Only that&#39;s not how it is at all.
If you are in outer space,

you are orbiting the Earth:
it&#39;s called free fall.
You&#39;re actually falling towards the Earth.

Think about this for a moment:
that&#39;s the feeling you get
if you&#39;re going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, &quot;Whoa!&quot;
Only you&#39;re doing this
the whole time you&#39;re orbiting the Earth,
for two, three, four hours, days.
Whatever it takes, right?
So, how does orbiting work?
Let&#39;s take a page from Isaac Newton.
He had this idea,

a little mental experiment:
You take a cannon,
you put it on top of a hill.
If you shoot the cannonball,
it goes a little bit away.
But if you shoot it harder,
it goes far enough so that it lands
a little bit past the curvature of Earth.
Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard,
it would go all the way around the Earth
and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something.
Let&#39;s zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite
over the North Pole of the Earth
and consider north to be up.
You&#39;re going to fall down
and hit the Earth.
But you are actually moving
sideways really fast.
So when you fall down,
you&#39;re going to miss.
You&#39;re going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down,
and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways.
So it&#39;s pulling you back in
and you fall down,
and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you&#39;re under the Earth.
The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you&#39;re moving sideways still.
So you&#39;re going to miss the Earth again.
Now you&#39;re on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward,
and the Earth&#39;s pulling you sideways.
So you&#39;re going to fall sideways,
but you&#39;re going to be moving up
and so you&#39;ll miss.
Now you&#39;re back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole,
going sideways and falling down,
and yep -- you guessed it.
You&#39;ll keep missing
because you&#39;re moving so fast.
In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth.
They&#39;re always falling towards the Earth,
but they&#39;re always missing, and therefore,
they&#39;re falling all the time.
They feel like they&#39;re falling,
so you just have to get over it.
So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped,
you could miss the Earth.
But there&#39;s a big problem.
First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second.
That&#39;s 18,000 miles an hour,
just over Mach 23!

The second problem:
If you&#39;re going that fast,
yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from,
but there&#39;s a lot of air in the way,
much less people and things.
So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction.
So, I do not recommend this.
