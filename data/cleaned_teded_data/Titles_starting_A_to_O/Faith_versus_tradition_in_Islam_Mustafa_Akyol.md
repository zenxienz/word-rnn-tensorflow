a few weeks ago I have a chance to go to
Saudi Arabia and the first thing I want
to do as a Muslim was to go to Mecca and
visit the Kaaba the holiest shrine of
Islam and I did that I put on my ritual
istic I to the holy mosque I did my
prayers I observed all the rituals and
meanwhile besides all the spirituality
there was one mundane detail in the
Kaaba that was pretty interesting for me
there was no separation of sexes in
other words man and woman were
worshiping all together they were
together while doing the top of the
circular walk around the Kaaba they were
together while praying and if you wonder
why this is interesting at all you have
to see the rest of Saudi Arabia because
this is a country which is strictly
divided between the sexes in other words
as men your are not simply supposed to
be in the same physical space with woman
and I noticed this in a very funny way I
i left the Kaaba to eat something in
downtown Mecca I headed to the nearest
burger king restaurant and I went there
I noticed that there&#39;s a male section
which is carefully separated from the
female section and i had to pay order
and eat at the male section it&#39;s funny I
said to myself you can mingle with the
opposite sex at the holy Kaaba but not
at the burger king quite quite ironic I
ronica it&#39;s also I think quite telling
because the Kaaba and the rituals around
it are relics from the earliest phase of
Islam that of prophet muhammad and if
there was a big emphasis at the time to
separate men from woman the rituals
around the Kaaba could have design
accordingly but apparently that was not
an issue at the time so the rituals came
that way this is also i think confirmed
by the fact that the seclusion a woman
and creating a divided society is
something that you also do not find in
the quran the very core of islam the
divine core of islam that all Muslims
are equally myself believe and I think
it&#39;s not an accident that you know you
don&#39;t find this idea in the very
origin of Islam because many scholars
who study the history of Islamic thought
Muslim scholars or esters think that
actually the practice of dividing man
and woman physically they came as a
later development in Islam as Muslims
adopted some pre-existing cultures and
traditions of the Middle East seclusion
a woman was actually a Byzantine and
Persian practice and Muslims adopted
that and made that a part of the
religion and actually this is just one
example of a much larger phenomenon what
we call today Islamic law and especially
Islamic culture and there are many
Islamic cultures actually the one in
Saudi Arabia is much different from
where I come from Istanbul or turkey but
still I mean if you&#39;re going to speak
about a Muslim culture this has a core
the divine message which began the
religion but then many traditions
perceptions many practices were added on
top of it and these were traditions of
the Middle East medieval traditions and
there are two important messages i think
or two lessons to take from that you
know reality first of all muslims pious
conservative believing muslims who want
to be loyal to their religion should not
cling on to everything in their culture
thinking that that&#39;s de Milo mandated
maybe some things are about traditions
and they need to be changed on the other
hand the Westerners who look at Islamic
culture and see some troubling aspects
should not readily conclude that this is
what Islam ordains maybe it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
Middle Eastern culture that became
confused with Islam there is a practice
called female circumcision it&#39;s
something terrible horrible it is
basically an operation to deprive woman
from sexual pleasure and Westerners
Europeans or Americans who didn&#39;t know
about this before faced this practice
within some of the Muslim communities
who migrated from North Africa and
they&#39;ve thought oh what a horrible
religion that is which you know or
ordained something like that but
actually when you look at female
circumcision you see that it has nothing
to do with Islam it&#39;s just a North
African practice which predates Islam it
was a four thousand eight years and
quite tellingly some Muslims do practice
that the Muslims
North Africa not in other places but
also the non-muslim communities or of
North Africa the Animists even some
Christians and even a Jewish tribe in
North Africa is known to practice female
circumcision so what might look like a
problem with an Islamic faith might turn
out to be a tradition that Muslims have
subscribed to the same thing can be said
for honor killings which is a recurrent
theme in the Western media and which is
of course a horrible tradition and we
see it early and in some Muslim
communities that tradition but in the
non-muslim communities of the Middle
East such as some Christian communities
Eastern Commission&#39;s you see the same
practice we had a tragic case of an
honor killing em with in Turkey&#39;s
Armenian community just a few months ago
now these are things about general
culture but I&#39;m also very much
interested in political culture and
whether liberty and democracy is
appreciated or whether you there&#39;s an
authoritarian political called culture
in which the state is supposed to impose
things on the citizens and it is no
secret that many Islamic movements in
the Middle East tend to be authoritarian
and some of the so-called Islamic
regimes such as Saudi Arabia Iran and
the worst case was a Taliban you know in
Afghanistan they are pretty
authoritarian no doubt about that for
example in Saudi Arabia there is a
phenomenon called the religious police
and the religious police imposes the
supposed Islamic way of life on every
citizen by force like women are forced
to cover their heads wear the hijab the
islamic headcover now that is pretty
authoritarian and i am that&#39;s something
I&#39;m very much critical off but when I
realize that the non-muslim or the
non-islamic minded actors in the same
geography sometimes behave similarly I
realize that the problems may be like
lies in the political culture of the
whole region not just Islam let me give
an example in Turkey where I come from
which is a hyper secular republic until
very recently we used to have what I
call secularism police which would guard
the university&#39;s against Wales to the
students in other words they would force
students to uncover their heads and I
think forcing people to uncover their
head
is as tyrannical as forcing them to
cover it should be the citizens decision
but when I saw that I said how many the
problem is interesting Oh Territorian
culture in the region and some Muslims
have been influenced by that but you
know the secular minded people can be
imposed by that maybe you&#39;d say it&#39;s a
problem about the political culture and
we have to see we have to think about
how to change that political culture now
these are some of the questions I had in
mind about a few years ago when I sat
down to write a book I said while i will
make a research about how is lon
actually came to be it came to be but it
today and what roles were taken and what
roads could have been taken the name of
the book is islam without extremes and
muslim case for liberty and as as the
subtitle suggests i looked at islamic
tradition and the history of islamic
thought from the perspective of
individual liberty and i tried to find
what are the strengths with regards to
individual liberty and there are
strengths in islamic tradition islam
actually as a monotheistic religion
which defined man as a responsible agent
by itself created the idea of the
individual in the Middle East and save
it from the communitarianism the
collectivism of the tribe you can drive
many ideas from that but besides that I
also saw problems with an Islamic
tradition but one thing was curious most
of those problems turn out to be
problems that emerge later not from the
very divine core of Islam the Quran but
from again traditions and mentalities or
the interpretations of the Quran that
Muslims made in the Middle Ages the
Quran for example doesn&#39;t condone
stoning there is no punishment on
apostasy there is no punishment on
personal sin is like drinking these
things which make Islamic law the
troubling aspects of Islamic law were
later developments and later
interpretations in Islam which means
that Muslims can today look at those
things and say well the core of our
religion is is here us to stay with us
it&#39;s our fate and we will be loyal to it
but we can change how it was interpreted
because it was interpreted according to
the time n Amelia in the Middle Ages now
we are living in a different world with
different values and different political
systems that interpretation is quite
possible and feasible
now if I were the only person thinking
that way but we would be in trouble but
that&#39;s not the case at all actually from
the 19th century on there&#39;s a whole
revisionist reformist whatever you call
it tradition a trend in Islamic thinking
and these were intellectuals or
statesmen of the 19th century and later
20th century which looked at Europe
basically and saw that the Europe has
many things to admire like science and
technology but not just that also
democracy Parliament the idea of
representation the idea of equal
citizenship these Muslim thinkers and
intellectuals and statesmen off the 19th
century looked at Europe saw these
things they said why we don&#39;t have these
things and they looked back at islamic
tradition they saw that there are
problems problematic aspects but they&#39;re
not the core of religion so maybe they
can be Rionda stood and the Quran can be
reread in the modern world that trend is
generally called as Islamic modernism
and it was advanced by intellectuals and
statesmen not just as an intellectual
idea though but also as a political
program and that&#39;s why actually in the
19th century the Ottoman Empire which
then covered the whole Middle East made
very important reforms reforms like
giving Christians and Jews and equal
citizenship status accepting a
constitution accepting a representative
Parliament advancing the freedom idea of
freedom of religion and that&#39;s why the
Ottoman Empire in its last actually
decades turned into a proton democracy a
constitutional monarchy and freedom was
a very important political value at a
time similarly in the Arab world there
was what the great Arab historian albert
irani defines as the liberal age he has
a book arabic thought in the liberal age
and the liberal age he defines is 19th
century and early twentieth century
quite not ibly this was the dominant
trend in the early 20th century among
islamic thinkers and statesmen and
halogens but there is a very curious
pattern in the rest of the 20th century
because we see a sharp decline in this
Islamic modernist line and in place of
that what happens is
that Islamism grows as an ideology which
is authoritarian which is quite strident
which is quite anti-western and which
ones to shape society based on an
utopian vision so Islamism is the
problematic idea that that really
created a lot of problems in 20th
century Islamic world and even in the in
the very extreme forms of Islamism led
to terrorism in the name of Islam which
is actually a practice that I&#39;m i think
is against Islam but you know some some
obviously extremists did not think that
way but there&#39;s a curious question if
Islamic modernism was so popular in the
nineteenth and early twentieth century
why Islamism became so popular in the
rest of the 20th century and this is a
question I think which needs to be
discussed carefully and in my book I
went to that question as well and
actually you don&#39;t need to be a rocket
scientist to understand that just you
look at the political history of the
20th century and you see well things
have changed a lot the context have
changed in the 19th century when Muslims
were looking at Europe as an example
they were independent they were more
self-confident in the early 20th century
with the fall of the Ottoman Empire the
whole Middle East was colonized when you
have colonialization what you have you
have anti colonialization so Europe is
not just an example now to emulate it&#39;s
an enemy to fight and to resist so
there&#39;s a very sharp decline in liberal
ideas in the Muslim world and what you
see is more more of a defensive rigid
reactionary strain which led to Arab
socialism arup national has been
ultimately the Islamist ideology and
when the colonial period ended what you
had was in place of that was generally
secular dictators which say their
country but did not bring democracy to
the country and establish their own
dictatorship and I think the West at
least some powers into a particular
United State made the mistake of
supporting those secular dictators
thinking that they are more you know
helpful for their interests but the fact
that those dictators suppressed
democracy in their country and suppress
Islamic groups in that country actually
made the Islamists much more strident so
in the 20th century you had this
cycle in their world where you have a
dictatorship suppressing its own people
including the Islamic pious and they&#39;re
reacting in reactionary ways there was
one country though which was able to
escape or stay away from that vicious
cycle and that&#39;s the country we&#39;re
coming from it that&#39;s that&#39;s turkey
Turkey has never been colonized so it
remained as an independent nation after
the fall of the Ottoman Empire that&#39;s
one thing to remember it did not share
the same anti-colonial hype that you can
find in some other countries in the
region secondly and most importantly
Turkey became a democracy earlier than
any of the countries we were talking
about in 1950 Turkey had the first free
and fair elections which ended the more
autocratic secular regime which was in
the beginning of Turkey and Turkish the
pious Muslims in Turkey saw that they
can change the political system by
voting and they realize that democracy
is something that is compatible with
Islam compatible with their values and
they&#39;ve been supportive of democracy
that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s an experience that
not every other Muslim nation in the
Middle East had until very recently
secondly in the past two decades thanks
to globalization thanks to the market
economy thanks to the rise of a middle
class we in Turkey see what I define as
a rebirth of Islamic modernism now
there&#39;s a more urban middle-class pious
Muslims who again look at their
tradition and see that there are some
problems in the tradition and the
understanding they need to be changed in
question and reformed and they look at
Europe and they see an example again to
follow they see an example at least to
take some inspiration from that&#39;s why
the EU process turkeys effort to join
the EU has been supported inside Turkey
by the Islamic pious while some sacred
nations were against that well that
process has been a little bit blurred by
the fact that not all Europeans are dead
welcoming but that&#39;s another discussion
but the pro-eu sentiment in Turkey in
the past decade has become almost an
Islamic cause and supported by the
Islamic Liberals and the secretary as
well as of course and thanks to that
Turkey has been able to create recently
create a success story in which Islam
and the most pies
understandings of Islam have become a
part of the democratic game and even
contributes to the democratic and
economic advance of the country and this
has been an inspiring example right now
for some of the Islamic movements or
some of the countries in the Arab world
you must have all seen the Arab Spring
which began internists and in Egypt and
Arab masses just revolted against their
dictators they were asking for democracy
they were asking for freedom and they
were they did not turn out to me the
Islamist boogeyman that the dictators
were always fooling using to you know
justify their regime they said that we
want freedom we want democracy we are
Muslim believers but we want to be
living as free people in free societies
of course this is a long road it&#39;s so
it&#39;s it&#39;s a democracy is not an
overnight achievement it&#39;s a process but
there is prompt this is a promising era
in the Muslim world and I believe that
the Islamic modernism which began in the
19th century but which had a setback in
the 20th century because of the
political troubles of the Muslim world
is having a rebirth and I think the
getaway message from that would be that
Islam despite some of the skeptics in
the West has the potential in itself to
create its own way to democracy creates
its own way to liberalism creates its
own way to freedom they just should be
allowed to work for that thanks so much
you
