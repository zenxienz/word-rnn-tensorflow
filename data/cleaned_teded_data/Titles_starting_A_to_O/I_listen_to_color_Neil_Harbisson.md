well I was born with with a rare visual
condition called achromatopsia which is
total colorblindness so I&#39;ve never seen
color and I don&#39;t know what color looks
like because I come from a grayscale
world to me the the sky is always gray
flowers are always gray and television
is still in black and white but since
the age of 21 instead of seeing color I
can hear color in 2003 I started the
project with computer scientist Adam
Montandon and the result with further
collaborations with better cachet from
Slovenia and Matias lisanna from
Barcelona is this electronic eye it&#39;s a
color sensor that detects the color
frequency in front of me and sense this
frequency to the chip installed at the
back of my head and I hear the color in
front of me through the bone through
bone conduction so for example they have
if I have like this is the sound of
purple
for example this is the sound of grass
this is red like that this is the sound
of a dirty sock which is like yellow
this one so I&#39;ve been hearing color all
the time for eight years since 2004 so I
find completely normal now to hear color
all the time
I&#39;d start though I had to memorize the
the names you give for each color so I
had to memorize the notes but after some
time all this information became a
perception I didn&#39;t have to think about
the notes and after some time this
perception became a feeling I started to
have favorite colors and I started to
dream in color so when I started to
dream in color is when I felt that the
software and my brain had united because
in my dreams it was my brain creating
electronic sounds it wasn&#39;t the software
so that&#39;s when I started to feel like a
cyborg it&#39;s when I started to feel that
the cybernetic device was no longer a
device
it had become a part of my body an
extension of my senses and after some
time it even became a part of my
official image this is my passport from
2004 you&#39;re not allowed to appear on UK
passports with electronic equipment but
I insisted to the passport office that
what they were seeing was actually a new
part of my body an extension of my brain
and they finally accepted me to appear
with the passport for them so life has
changed dramatically since I here color
because color is almost everywhere so
biggest changes for example is going to
an art gallery I can listen to a Picasso
for example so it&#39;s like a going to a
concert hall because I can listen to the
paintings and supermarkets I find this
is very shocking very very attractive to
walk along the supermarket it&#39;s like
going to a nightclub it&#39;s full of
different melodies yeah especially the
aisle with cleaning product is just
fabulous
also the way I dressed has changed
before I used to dress in a way that it
looked good
now I dress in a way that it sounds good
so today I&#39;m dressed in c-major so it&#39;s
quite a happy Court if I had to go to a
funeral though I would dress in B minor
which would be turquoise purple and
orange also food the way I look at food
has changed because now I can display
the food on a plate so I can eat my
favorite song so depending on how I
displayed I can hear and I can compose
music with food so imagine a restaurant
where we can have like Lady Gaga&#39;s
salads as starters and this would get
teenagers to eat their vegetables
probably and also some Rachmaninoff
piano concertos as main dishes and some
Bjork Madonna desserts that would be a
very exciting a restaurant like you can
actually eat songs also the way I
perceive Beauty has changed because when
I look at someone I hear their face so
someone might look very beautiful but
sound terrible and it might happen the
opposite the other way around so I
really enjoy creating like sound
portraits of people instead of drawing
someone&#39;s face like drawing the shape I
pointed them with the eye and I write
down the different notes I hear and then
I create sound portraits
here&#39;s some faces
Oh
yeah nicole kidman sounds good some
people I would never relate but they
sound similar Prince Charles has some
similarities with nicole kidman they
have similar sound of eyes so you relate
people that you wouldn&#39;t relate and you
can actually also creates our concerts
by looking at the audience faces so I
connect the eye and then I I play the
audience&#39;s faces the good thing about
this is if the concert doesn&#39;t sound
good it&#39;s their fault it&#39;s got my focus
and so another thing that happens is
that I started having this secondary
effect that normal sounds started to
become color I heard a telephone tone
and it felt green because it sounded
just like the color green the BBC beeps
they sound turquoise and listening to
Mozart became a yellow experience so I
started to paint music and paint
people&#39;s voices because people&#39;s voices
have frequencies that I relate to color
and here&#39;s some music translated into
into color example Mozart Queen of the
Night looks like this very yellow and
very colourful because there&#39;s many
different frequencies and this is a
completely different song it&#39;s Justin
Bieber&#39;s baby so it&#39;s very pink and very
yellow so um
also voices I can transform speeches
into into color for example these are
two very well-known speeches one of them
is Martin Luther King&#39;s I have a dream
and the other one is Hitler and I like
to exhibit these paintings in the
exhibition hot without labels and then I
ask people which one do you prefer
and most people change their preference
when I tell them that the one on the
left is Hitler and the one on the right
is Martin Luther King so I got to a
point when I was able to perceive 360
colors just like human vision I was able
to differentiate all the degrees of the
color
but then I just thought that this human
vision was wasn&#39;t good enough there&#39;s
many many more colors around us that we
cannot perceive but the electronic eyes
can perceive so I decided to continue
extending my color senses and I added
infrared and I added ultraviolet to the
color to sound scale so now I can hear
colors that the human eye cannot
perceive for example perceiving infrared
is good because you can actually detect
if there&#39;s movement detectors in a room
I can hear if someone points at me with
a remote control and the good thing
about perceiving ultraviolet is that you
can hear if it&#39;s a good day or a bad day
to sunbathe because ultraviolet is a
dangerous color color that can actually
kill us so I think we should all have
this wish to perceive things that we
cannot perceive that&#39;s why two years ago
I created the cyborg Foundation which is
a foundation that tries to help people
become a cyborg tries to encourage
people to extend their senses by using
technology as part of the body we should
all think that knowledge comes from our
senses so if we extend our senses we
will consequently extend our knowledge I
think life will be much more exciting
when we stop creating applications for
mobile phones and we start creating
applications for our own body think this
will be a big big change that we&#39;ll see
during this century so I do encourage
you all to think about which senses
you&#39;d like to extend I would encourage
you to become a cyborg you won&#39;t be
alone thank you
