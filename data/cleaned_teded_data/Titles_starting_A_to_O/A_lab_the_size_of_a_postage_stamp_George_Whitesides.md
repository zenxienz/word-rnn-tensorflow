the problem that I want to talk with you
about is really the problem of how does
one supply health care in a world in
which cost is everything how do you do
that and the basic paradigm we want to
suggest to you I want to suggest to you
is one in which you say that in order to
treat disease you have to first know
what you&#39;re treating that&#39;s diagnostics
and then you have to do something so the
program that we&#39;re involved in is
something which we call Diagnostics for
all or zero cost diagnostics how do you
provide medically relevant information
at as close as possible to zero cost how
do you do it let me just give you two
examples the rigors of military medicine
are not so dissimilar from the third
world poor resources a rigorous
environment a series of problems in
light weight and things of this kind and
also not so different from the home
health care and diagnostic system world
so the technology that I want to talk
about is for the third world for the
developing world but it has I think much
broader application because information
is so important in the healthcare system
so you see two examples here one is a
lab that&#39;s actually a fairly high end
laboratory in Africa the second is
basically an entrepreneur who is set up
and doing who-knows-what in a table in a
market I don&#39;t know what kind of health
care is delivered there but it&#39;s not
really what is probably most efficient
what is our approach and the way in
which one typically approaches a problem
of lowering costs starting from the
perspective of the United States is to
take our solution and then to try to cut
costs out of it no matter how you do
that you&#39;re not going to start with a
hundred-thousand-dollar instrument and
bring it down to no cost it isn&#39;t going
to work so the approach that we took was
the other way around ask what is the
cheapest possible stuff that you could
make a diagnostic system out of and get
useful information
can add function and what we&#39;ve chosen
this paper what you see here is a
prototypic device it&#39;s about a
centimeter on the side it&#39;s about the
size of a fingernail the lines around
the edges are a polymer it&#39;s made of
paper and paper of course wicks fluid as
you know paper cloths drop wine on the
table cloth and the wine wicks all over
everything I&#39;ve put it on your shirt it
ruins the shirt that&#39;s what a
hydrophilic surface does so in this
device the idea is that you dip the
bottom end of it in a drop of in this
case urine the fluid wicks its way into
those chambers at the top the brown
color indicates the amount of glucose in
the urine the blue color indicates the
amount of protein in the urine and the
combination of those two is a first
order shot at a number of useful things
that you want so this is an example of a
device made from a simple piece of paper
now how simple can you make the
production why do we choose paper
there&#39;s an example of the same thing on
a finger showing you just basically what
it looks like one reason for using paper
is that it&#39;s everywhere we have made
these kinds of devices using napkins and
toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of
stuff so the production capability is
there the second is you can put lots and
lots of tests in a very small place I&#39;ll
show you in a moment that the stack of
paper there would probably hold
something like a hundred thousand tests
something of that kind and then finally
a point that you don&#39;t think of so much
in developed world medicine it
eliminates sharps and what sharps means
is needles things that stick she was
taken a sample of someone&#39;s blood and
the someone might have hepatitis C you
don&#39;t want to make mistake and stick it
in you just you don&#39;t want to do that so
how do you dispose of that it&#39;s a
problem everywhere and here you simply
burn it so it&#39;s a sort of a practical
approach to starting on things now you
say if paper is a good idea other people
have surely thought of it and the answer
is of course yes those half of you
roughly who are
and at some point may have had a
pregnancy test and the most common of
these is in a device that looks like the
thing on the left it&#39;s something called
a lateral flow immunoassay and in that
particular test you&#39;re in either
containing a hormone called HCG does or
does not flow across a piece of paper
and there are two bars one bar indicates
that the test is working and if the
second bar shows up you&#39;re pregnant this
is a terrific kind of test in a binary
world and the nice thing about pregnancy
is either you are pregnant or you&#39;re not
pregnant you&#39;re not partially pregnant
are thinking about being pregnant or
something of that sort so it works very
well there but it doesn&#39;t work very well
when you need more quantitative
information there are also dip sticks
but if you look at the dip sticks there
for another kind of urine analysis there
are a lot of colors and things like that
what do you actually do about that in a
difficult circumstance so the approach
that we started with we&#39;ve started with
is to ask is it really practical to make
things of this sort and that problem is
now in a purely engineering way solved
and the procedure that we have is simply
to start with paper you run it through a
new kind of printer called a wax printer
the wax printer does is what looks like
printing it is printing you put that on
you warm it a little bit the wax prints
through sodus orbs into the paper and
you end up with the device that you want
the printers cost 800 bucks now they&#39;ll
make we estimate that if you were to run
them 24 hours a day they&#39;d make about 10
million tests a year so it&#39;s a solved
problem that particular problem is
solved and there&#39;s an example of the
kind of thing that you see that&#39;s on a
piece of eight by twelve paper that
takes about two seconds to make and so I
regard that as done there&#39;s a very
important issue here which is that
because it&#39;s a printer a color printer
it prints colors that&#39;s what color
printers do I&#39;ll show you in a moment
that&#39;s actually quite useful now the
next question that you would like to ask
is what would you like to measure what
would you like to analyze and the thing
which you would most like to analyze
were a fair distance from its what&#39;s
called fever of on
diagnosed origin someone comes into the
clinic they have a fever they feel bad
what do they have do they have TB do
they have AIDS do they have a common
cold the triage problem that&#39;s a hard
problem for reasons that I won&#39;t go
through there an awful lot of things
that you&#39;d like to distinguish among but
then there are a series of things aids
hepatitis malaria TB others and simpler
ones such as guidance of treatment now
even that&#39;s more complicated than you
think a friend of mine works in trans
cultural psychiatry and he is interested
in the question of why people do and
don&#39;t take their meds so dapsone or
something like that you have to take it
for a while he has a wonderful story of
talking to a villager in India and
saying have you taken your dapsone yes
have you taken it every day yes have you
taken it for a month yes what the guy
actually meant was that he&#39;d fed 30 day
dose of dapsone to his dog that morning
he was telling the truth because in a
different culture you know the dog is a
surrogate for you do you know today this
month since the rainy season there are
lots of opportunities for
misunderstanding and so an issue here is
to in some cases to figure out how to
deal with matters that seem
uninteresting like compliance now take a
look at what a typical test looks like
prick a finger you get some blood about
fifty microliters that&#39;s about all
you&#39;re going to get because you can&#39;t
use you know the usual sort of systems
you can&#39;t manipulate it very well
although I&#39;ll show something about that
in a moment so you take the drop of
blood no further manipulations you put
it on a little device the device filters
out the blood cells lets the serum go
through and you get a series of colors
down in the bottom there and the colors
indicate disease are normal but even
that&#39;s complicated because to you to me
colors might indicate normal but after
all we&#39;re all suffering from and
probably in excess of education what do
you do about something which requires
quantitative analysis and so the
solution that we and many other
people are thinking about their and at
this point there&#39;s a dramatic flourish
that outcomes the universal solution to
everything these days which is a cell
phone in this particular case a camera
phone they&#39;re everywhere of 6 billion a
month in India and the idea is that what
one does is to take the device you dip
it you develop the color you take a
picture the picture goes to a central
laboratory you don&#39;t have to send out a
doctor you send out somebody who can
just take the sample and in the clinic
either a doctor or ideally a computer in
this case does the analysis turns out to
work actually quite well particularly
when your color printer has printed the
color bars that indicate how things work
so my view of the health care worker of
the future is not a doctor but it&#39;s an
eighteen-year-old otherwise unemployed
who has two things he has a backpack
full of these tests and a Lancet to
occasionally take a blood sample and an
ak-47 and these are the things that
getting through his day there&#39;s another
very interesting connection here and
that is that what one wants to do is to
pass through useful information over
what is generally a pretty awful
telephone system it turns out there&#39;s an
enormous amount of information already
available on that subject which is the
Mars rover problem how do you get back
an accurate view of the color on Mars if
you have a really terrible bandwidth to
do it with and the answer is not
complicated but it&#39;s one which I don&#39;t
want to go through here other than to
say that the communication systems for
doing this are really pretty well
understood also a fact which you may not
know is that the compute capability of
this thing is not so different from the
compute capability of your desktop
computer this is a fantastic device
which is only beginning to be tapped I
don&#39;t know whether the idea of a you
know one computer one child makes any
sense that here&#39;s here&#39;s the computer of
the future because the screen is already
there and you they&#39;re ubiquitous right
now let me show you just a little bit
about advanced devices and we&#39;ll start
by posing a little problem what you see
here is another centimeter size device
and the different colors are different
colors of die
and you notice something which might
strike you is a little bit interesting
which is the yellow seems to disappear
get through the blue and then get
through the red how does that happen how
do you make something flow through
something and it hurts the answer is you
don&#39;t you make it flow under and over
but now the question is how do you make
it flow under and over in a piece of
paper and the answer is that what you do
and the details are not terribly
important here is to make something more
elaborate you take several different
layers of paper each one containing its
own little fluid system and you separate
them by pieces of literally double-sided
carpet tape the stuff you used to stick
the carpets onto the floor and the fluid
will flow from one layer into the next
it distributes itself flows through
further holes distributes itself and
what you see in the lower right-hand
side there is a sample in which a single
sample of blood has been put on the top
and it has gone through and distributed
itself into the sixteen holes on the
bottom in a piece of paper basically it
looks like a chip two pieces of paper
thick and in this particular case we
were just interested in the
replicability of that but that is in
principle the way you solve the fever
unexplained origin problem because each
one of those spots then becomes a test
for a particular set of markers of
disease and this will work in due course
and here&#39;s an example of a slightly more
complicated device there&#39;s the chip you
dip in a corner the fluid goes into the
center it distributes itself out into
these various wells or holes and turns
color and all done with paper and carpet
tape so it&#39;s i think is low-cost as
we&#39;re likely to be able to come up and
make things now i have one last two last
little stories to tell you in finishing
off this business this is one one of the
things that one does occasionally need
to do is to separate blood from blood
cells from serum and the question was
here we do it by taking a sample we put
it in a centrifuge we spin it and you
get blood cells out terrific what
happens if you don&#39;t have an electricity
and the centrifuge in whatever and we
thought for a while of how you might do
this of the way in fact you do it is
what&#39;s shown here you get a eggbeater
which is everywhere and you saw off a
blade and then you take tubing and you
stick it on that you put the blood end
you spin it somebody sits there and
spins it works really really well and we
said that we did the physics of egg
beaters and self aligning tubes and all
the rest of that kind of thing set it
off to a journal we were very proud of
this particularly the title which was a
beater a centrifuge and we set it off
and by return mail it came back I call
up the editor I said what&#39;s going on how
is this possible the editor said with
enormous disdain I read this and we&#39;re
not going to publish it because we only
publish science and it&#39;s an important
issue because it means that we have to
as a society think about what we value
and if it&#39;s just papers in phys Rev
letters we&#39;ve got a problem here&#39;s
another example of something which is
this is a little spectrophotometer it
measures the absorption of light in a
sample the neat thing about this is you
have light source that flickers on and
off at about a thousand Hertz another
light source that detects that&#39;s light
at a thousand Hertz and so you can run
this system in broad daylight it
performs about equivalently to a system
that&#39;s in the order of 100 thousand
dollars it costs fifty dollars we can
probably make it for fifty cents if we
put our mind to it why doesn&#39;t somebody
do it and the answer is how do you make
a profit in a capitalist system doing
that interesting problem so let me
finish by saying that we thought about
this as a kind of engineering problem
and we&#39;ve asked what is you know what is
the scientific unifying idea here and
we&#39;ve decided that we should think about
this not so much in terms of cost but in
terms of simplicity the simplicity is a
neat word you&#39;ve got to think about what
simplicity means I know what it is but I
don&#39;t actually know what it means so I
actually wasn&#39;t interested enough in
this to put together a several groups of
people the most recent in
volved a couple of people at MIT one of
them being an exceptionally bright kid
who&#39;s one of the very few people I would
think of who&#39;s in authentic genius we
all struggled for an entire day to think
about simplicity and I want to give you
the answer of this deep scientific
thought so in a sense you get what you
pay for thank you very much
