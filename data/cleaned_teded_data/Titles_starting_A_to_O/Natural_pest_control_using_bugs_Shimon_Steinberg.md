other bad lover myself not from
childhood by the way but rather late
when I bachelor the major in zoology tel
Aviv University I kind of fell in love
with bugs then with insallah gee I took
the course of the discipline of
entomology the science of these days and
then I thought myself how can I be
practical or or help in the size of
entomology and then I&#39;ll move to the
world of plant protection plan
protection from insects from bed bugs
and then within plant protection I came
into the discipline of biological pest
control which we actually define as the
use of living organisms to reduce
populations of notches plant pests so
it&#39;s a whole discipline in atlanta tech
chure the AV and reduction of chemicals
and biological pest control by the way
or these good bugs that we are talking
about they existed the world for
thousands and thousands of years for a
long long time but only the habitat last
hundred and twenty years people started
or people you more in for how to explore
to how to use this biological controls
phenomenon or in fact natural control
phenomena to their own leads because
biological controls an honor you can see
it in your backyard just take a
magnifying glass you see what I have
here that&#39;s a magnifier times 10 yeah x
10 just open it you just twist leaves
and you see a whole new world of by root
insects a little spiders of one
millimeter
half to me two millimeters long and you
can distinguish we take the good ones
and the bad ones so this phenomenon of
natural control exists literally
everywhere here in front of this
building I sure just have a look at the
plans so is everywhere and we need to
know how to exploit it well let us know
just hand by hand and browse through
just a few examples what is a pest what
damage it actually flicks on the plant
and what is the natural enemy the
biological control agent or the good but
that we have two people in general I&#39;m
going to talk about insects and spiders
or bites let us call them in sectors
sick sled organisms and spider or mice
d8 leg organisms let&#39;s have a look at
that here is the best devastating test a
spider bite because it has a lot of
wedding like a spider you see the mother
in between and two daughters probably on
the left and right and a single egg on
the right hand side and then you see
what type of damage it can inflict on
your right hand side you can see a
cucumber leaf and in the middle cotton
leaf and on the left and tomato leaf
with these little stippling they can
literally turn from green to white
because of the socket piercing in both
parts of those spiders but here comes
nature that provides us with a good
fighter this is a predatory multi just
as small as the spider mite by the way
one maybe two to me get along not more
than that running quickly hunting
chasing the spider mites and here you
can see this lady in action on your
left-hand side just Pierce&#39;s such the
body fluids on the left hand side of the
test might and after five
this is what you see just typical dead
corpse shriveled sucked out dead parts
of the spider mind and next to it too
satiated individuals of predatory my
mother on the left hand side a young
lift from the right hand side by the way
a meal for them for 24 hours are about
five individuals of the spider mite of
the bed mites and or 15 to 20 eggs of
the best minds by the way they are
hungry always and there is another
example 80s by the way springtime now in
Israel when temperature rises sharply
you can see those red ones those aphids
all over the plants in your hibiscus in
your lantana of the young fresh foliage
of the spring flush so cold by the way
with aces you have all the females like
Amazon&#39;s females giving rise to females
if you rise to other females no bells at
all parthenogenesis also so cool and
they are very happy with that the parent
here you can see the damage because
aphids secrete some sticky sugary liquid
cold-hearted you and this just plops the
upper part of the plan here you see
typical cucumber leaf that turned
actually from green to black because of
a black fungus sooty mold which is
covering it and here comes the salvation
through this parasitic wasp here we&#39;re
not talking about the predator here we
are talking about a parasite not a
two-leg parasite but an antler parasite
of the world yeah this is a parasitic
wasps I get two meters long slather and
very quick and sharp flyer and here you
can see this parasite in action like in
an acrobatic maneuver she stands visa
vie in front of the victim of the right
hand side
its abdomen and inserting a single egg a
single egg into the body fluids of the
18 by the way dat tries to escape jejeje
kicks and bites and secretes different
liquids but nothing will happen in fact
only the end of the parasitoid will be
inserted into the body fluids of the
exit and after a few days depends on
temperature the egg will hatch and the
larvae of this parasite will eat the a
feed from the inside and after this is
all natural this is all natural this is
on section nothing at all again in your
backyard in your back door
this is the end result Muffy&#39;s mu mm why
this is the visual result of a dead
a-fib you come to see inside in fact and
developing parasitoid it after a few
minutes you see halfway out the girth is
almost complete you can see by the way
different movies etc and it takes just a
few minutes and if this is a female she
will immediately mate with a male and
off she goes because time is very short
these female candidates only three to
four days and she needs to give rise to
around four hundred eggs that means she
has four hundred dead outfits to put her
eggs into their body fluids this is of
course not the end of it there is a
whole wealth of other natural enemies
that this is just the last example again
we&#39;ll start first with the test the
thrips by the way all these weird names
I did bother you with the last night of
these creatures okay just a popular
names but this is a nice slender very
bad test if you can see this sweet
peppers this is not just an exotic
ornamental sweet pepper this is a sweet
pepper which is not consumable because
it is suffering from a viral disease
transmitted by those three adults and
you toss the natural enemy my note
pirate but my route because it is rather
small yeah here you can see the adult
lad and two young ones and again in
action this adult pierces the trips
sucking it with you just to several
minutes just going to the other prey
continuing all over the place if we
spread those my route by redbox the good
ones for example in a sweet pepper plot
they go to the flowers and look this
flower is flooded with predatory birds
with the good ones after what I get out
the bad ones that rips so this is a very
positive situation by the way know how
to the developing fruit know how to the
fruit set everything is just five
these circumstances but again the
questioning is pure salt on what I want
to one place is a the best the natural
remedy what we do is actually this in
the Northeast Israel in kaposvar meow
there is a facility that mass-produces
those natural enemies in other words
what we do there we amplify we amplify
the natural control or the biological
control phenomenon in thirty thousand
square meters of state-of-the-art
greenhouses there we are mass-producing
those predatory mites those my new
pirate Bob&#39;s those transitive wasps etc
etc many different parts by the way they
have a very nice landscape you sweetie
jordanian mountains on one hand and they
d Jordan Valley on the other hand and it
good mild winter and a nice hot supper
which is an excellent condition to mass
produce those creatures by the way mass
production it is not genetic
manipulation there are no care of
genetically modified organism whatsoever
take them from nature and the only thing
that we do we give them the optimal
conditions under the greenhouses or in
the climate rules in order to
proliferate multiplied every produce and
that&#39;s what we get in fact you see under
a microscope you see on the upper left
corner you see the single predatory mite
and this is the whole bunch of predatory
mites you see this apple you see this
one I have one gram of those predatory
mites what grams eighteen thousand
individuals eighty thousand individuals
are good enough to control one acre four
thousand square meters of a strawberry
plot against itemized for the whole
season of almost one year and we can
produce from this believe you me several
dozens of tioga
on an annual basis so this is what they
call amplification of the phenomenon and
no we just do not disrupt the balance on
the contrary because we bring it to
agricultural plot work the balance or
what&#39;s already disrupted by the Capitals
you recover those natural enemies in
order to reverse a little bit the wheel
and to bring more natural balance to the
agricultural blood by reducing those
stallions that&#39;s the whole idea then
what is the impact this table we can
actually see what is an impact of a
successful biological control by good
bugs for example in Israel where we
employ more than 1,000 hectares 10,000
dunams it is really terms of biological
pest control eat sweet pepper under
protection seventy-five percent of the
pesticides were actually reduced and
Israeli strawberries even wore eighty
percent of the pesticide especially does
aid against pests mites in strawberries
so the impact is very strong and there
was a question especially if you ask
growers agriculturists why biological
control why good bucks by the way the
number of answers you get equals to the
number of people you ask but if we go
for example to this place South East
Israel they are very about the great
rift valley where they really top-notch
the role of the Israeli Arab culture is
located especially other greenhouse
conditions or other screenhouse
conditions if you drive all the way to a
lot you see this just in the book of the
desert and if you soo min you can
definitely watch this Brad parents with
our grandchildren distribute the natural
enemies the good bugs instead of wearing
special clothes
and gas masks and apply chemicals so
safety with respect to the application
this is not an one answer that we get
from growers why biological control
number too many growers are in fact
petrified from the idea of resistance
that deep tests will become resistant to
the chemicals just in our case the
bacteria become resistant to antibiotics
it&#39;s the same it can happen very quickly
fortunately is the biological control or
international control resistance is
extremely rare it hardly happens because
this is introduction this is the natural
issue unlike resistant which happens
even in the case of chemicals and
thirdly public demand public demand the
more the public the public demonstrative
of chemicals more growers become aware
of the fact they should wherever they
can and wherever possible to replace the
chemical control with Bible control even
here there is another grower you see
very interested in the butts the dead
ones and the good ones where it is
magnified already on her head just
walking safely in her prob finally I
were to get to actually to my vision or
in fact my dream because you see this is
the reality have a look at the gap if
you take the overall turn over of the
biocontrol industry worldwide is 250
billion dollars and look at the overall
pesticide industry in all the drops
throughout the world I think it&#39;s x 100
the lender 25 billion so there&#39;s a huge
gap to bridge so actually how can we do
it how can we bridge or that&#39;s a narrow
this graph this gap in the course of the
year&#39;s first of all we need to find more
robust good and reliable biological
solutions more group us that we can
either mass-produce or actually observe
in the field secondly to create even
more intensive and straight public
demand too reductive temples in
agricultural fresh produce and thirdly
also to increase awareness by the
growers to the potential of this
industry and this gap really narrows
step by step it does left so I think my
last slide is all we are saying we can
actually see it give nature a chance so
I&#39;m saying it on behalf of all the
biocontrol practitioners and it&#39;ll
matter in Israel and abroad really did
nature HS
