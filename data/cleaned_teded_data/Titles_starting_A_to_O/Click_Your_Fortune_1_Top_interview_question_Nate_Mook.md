We always ask people,
&quot;What took you so long?&quot;
And this is an interesting question
because when you ask somebody this,
it&#39;s completely open to their interpretation
of what you mean.
Sometimes somebody thinks,
&quot;What took me so long
to get to this location I&#39;m at now?&quot;
Sometimes it&#39;s, &quot;What took me so long
to get to the point of my career
where I&#39;m at right now?&quot;
And it&#39;s interesting
because you get to learn a little bit about that person
depending on how they answer the question,
and I think that&#39;s fascinating insight
into somebody&#39;s personality.
