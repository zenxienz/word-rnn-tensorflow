Mysteries of vernacular:
Sarcophagus,
a stone coffin typically adorned
with decorative carvings or inscriptions.
The history of the word sarcophagus
is so skin-crawlingly grotesque,
it seems to come right out
of a low-budget horror film.
Rather than having
a B-movie origin, however,
its roots can be traced back
to the early Roman Empire
where the Greek word sarkophagus
was used to describe the limestone
that a coffin was made of,
not the coffin itself.
According to the Roman
scholar Pliny the Elder,
citizens of the Empire believed
that limestone from a quarry near Troy
would dissolve flesh.
For this reason, it was quite desireable
in the construction of coffins.
Though it&#39;s unclear
if the belief was widespread
or even accurately reported by Pliny,
what is certain is that sarkophagus
came from the Greek words sark,
meaning flesh,
and phagein,
a verb meaning to eat.
From flesh-eating stone
to stone coffin,
it&#39;s a fitting etymology
for the final resting
place of the deceased.
