good afternoon I am NOT a farmer I&#39;m not
I&#39;m a parent I&#39;m a resident and I&#39;m a
teacher and this is my world along the
way I&#39;ve started noticing i&#39;m on my
third generation of kids that they&#39;re
getting bigger they&#39;re getting sicker in
addition to these complexities i just
learned that seventy percent of the kids
that i see who are labeled learning
disabled would not have been had they
had proper prenatal nutrition on the
realities of my community is simple they
look like this kids should not have to
grow up and look at things like this and
his jobs continue to leave my community
and energy continues to come in be
exported in it&#39;s no wonder that really
some people refer to the South Bronx as
a desert but I&#39;m the oldest sixth grader
you&#39;ll ever meet so I get up every day
with this tremendous amount of food
Yasim that I&#39;m hoping to share with you
all today acts and with that note I come
with you with this belief that kids
should not have to leave their community
to live learn and earn a better one so
I&#39;m here to tell you a story about me
and this wall that I met outside which
I&#39;m now bringing inside and it starts
with three people crazy teacher that&#39;s
me on the left I dress up pretty thank
you my wife I love me from getting a
good suit my passionate borough
president a guy named George arrow and
from green leading technologies who
helped me with my class and help me get
involved with this patented technology
but it all starts with seeds and
classrooms in my place which looks like
this and i&#39;m here today hope something
that my reach will exceed my grasp and
that&#39;s really what this is all about and
it starts with incredible kids like this
we come early and stay late all of my
kids are either IEP or e ll learners the
most to come with a lot of handicaps
most are homeless and many are in foster
care almost all my kids live below
poverty but with those seeds from day
one we are growing in my classroom and
this is what it looks like in my
classroom and you see how it tented
these kids are to these seeds and then
you notice that those seeds become farms
across the Bronx that look like this but
again i am not a farmer I&#39;m a teacher
and I don&#39;t like weeding and I don&#39;t
like black back-breaking labor so I
wanted to figure out how to get this
kind of success into something small
like this
bring it into my classroom so that
handicap cage could do it kids you
didn&#39;t want to be outside could do it
and everyone could have access so I
called Georgia Roman and what do you
know he came to my players and we built
an indoor edible wall and let me do it
when we parted with authentic learning
experience project-based learning and lo
and behold we gave birth to the first
edible wall in New York City so if
you&#39;re hungry get up and eat you can do
it right now makes it to play cow all
the time ok what we were just getting
started the kids love the technology so
we called up Jordan said we got to learn
more now mayor bloomberg take you very
much we no longer need work permits
which comes with licensed and bonded
contractors were available for you we
decided to go to Boston and my kids from
the poorest congressional district in
America became the first to install of
green wall designed by computer with
real live learning kills 21 stories up
to you looking to visit so on top of the
John Hancock building but closer to home
we started installing these walls and
schools it looked like this with
lighting like that real LED stuff 21st
century technology and what do you know
we made 21st century money and that was
groundbreaking at wow this is my harvest
people and what do you do with this food
you cook it none of my heirloom students
making heirloom sauce with plastic forks
and we get it into the cafeteria we
grossed up and we feed our teachers and
that is the youngest nationally
certified workforce in America with our
Bronx borough president and what we do
then well I met nice people like you and
they invited us to the Hamptons so I
call this from South Bronx to
Southampton
and we started putting in rooms that
look like this and when Katie&#39;s from
destitute neighborhoods can start
building landscape like this Wow people
noticed and so he got invited back this
past summer we actually moved into the
Hamptons paying 35 hours a week for a
house and we learned how to surf and
when you can do stuff like this these
are my kids putting in this technology
when you can build a roof that looks
like that on a house that looks like
that the sedum that looks like this this
is the new green roof ed so you may
wonder what does a wall like this really
do for kids besides changing landscapes
and mindsets okay I&#39;m going to tell you
what it does it gets me to meet
incredible contractors like this Jim
Ellenberger from Ellenberger services
and this is where it becomes true triple
bottom line because Jim realized that
these kids my future farmers really had
the skills he needed to build affordable
housing for New Yorkers right in our own
neighborhood and this is what my kids
are doing making living wave now if
you&#39;re like me you live in a building
there are seven guys out of work looking
to manage a million dollars I don&#39;t have
but if you need a toilet fixed or you
know some shelving I gotta wait six
months for an appointment with someone
who drives a much nicer car than me
that&#39;s the beauty of this economy but my
kids are now licensed and bonded in
training that&#39;s my first student to open
up the first in his family to have a
bank account this immigrant student the
first one in his family to use an ATM
and this is the true triple bottom line
because we can take neighborhoods that
were abandoned and destitute and turn
them into something like this with
interiors like this Wow people notice
and notice they did so CNN called i&#39;m
going to delighted to have them come to
our farmers market and then when
Rockefeller Center said NBC could you
put in some edible wall who were
delighted but this I show you when kids
from the poorest congressional district
in America can build a 30-foot by
15-foot wall design it plant it and
install it in the heart of New York City
that&#39;s a true Cisse played a moment
really scholastic if you ask me
but this is not a getting image that&#39;s a
picture I took of my Bronx borough
president addressing my kids in his
house not the jail house making them
feel a part of that&#39;s our state senator
Gustavo Rivera and Bob Peter coming to
my classroom to make my kids feel
important and when the Bronx borough
president shows up in the stage center
come to our class believe you me the
Bronx can change attitudes now we are
poised ready will he get able to explore
our talent diversity in ways we never
even imagined and when the local center
to get on a scale public and says he&#39;s
gotta lose weight so do I and I tell you
what I&#39;m doing it and so are the kids
okay and then celebrity starving produce
Pete can&#39;t believe what we grow Lorna&#39;s
a scam and donated books okay we&#39;re
feeding seniors and when we realize that
we were growing for food justice in the
South Bronx so to the international
community a my kids from the South Bronx
were repping the first international
green roof conference but that&#39;s just to
be great except what about locally well
we met this woman a Miss Richards with
the ground up campaign unbelievable
through her my kids the most
disenfranchised are marginalized were
able to roll out hundred gardens to new
york city public schools that triple
bottom line okay a year ago today I was
invited to the new york academy of
medicine I thought this concept of
design is strong and healthy new york
made sense especially when the resources
were free so thank you all and i love
them they introduced me to the new york
city&#39;s tkachuk Alliance for help again
free resources don&#39;t waste them and what
do you know six months later my school
and my occasion was awarded the first
ever high school award of excellence for
creating a healthy school environment
the greenest class in New York City but
more importantly is my kids learned yet
they learn to give and we took the money
that remain from our farmers market
started buying gifts for the homeless
and for needy around the world so we
started giving back and that&#39;s when I
realized that the greening of America
starts first with the pocket then with
the heart and then with the mind so we
were on to something and we still on to
something and thank time Trinity Wall
Street notice because they gave us the
birth of green Bronx machine with 3,000
strong right now and what does it really
do it teaches kids to revision their
commute
they grow up in places like this they
could imagine it like this and my kids
trained and certified mind you get the
tax abatement Thank You mayor bloomberg
you take communities that look like this
and convert them into things that look
like that and that to meet people with
another true sees tape wait a moment now
how does it start it starts with schools
no more little Nick&#39;s and little Nets
group by broccoli group by your favorite
vegetable something you can aspire to
okay and these are my future farmers of
america growing up in brookpark on 140
first feet the most migrant community
america vin tenacious little ones learn
how to garden like this it&#39;s no wonder
we get fruit like that and i love it and
so today and we&#39;re building teepees when
neighborhoods that were burning down and
that to true si se puede moment and
again brookpark feeds hundreds of people
without a food stamp or a fingerprint
the poorest congressional district in
America the most migratory community
america we can do this missile guard
isn&#39;t cranking out food and epic
proportion rooting kids into an economy
they never imagined now somewhere over
the rainbow my friends is the South
Bronx of America and we&#39;re doing it how
does it start well look at jose&#39;s
attention to detail thank God Omar knows
that carrots come from the ground and
not online in the supermarket it through
a bulletproof window or through a piece
of styrofoam and when Henry knows that
green is good so to lie and when you
expand their palates expand their
vocabulary and most importantly when you
put big kids together with little kids
you get the big fat white guy out of the
middle school and you create this kind
of accountability amongst peers which is
incredible god I&#39;m gonna run out of
times I&#39;ve got to keep it moving but
this is my weekly paycheck for kids
that&#39;s all green graffiti this is what
we&#39;re doing and will hold the glory and
bounty that is Bronx County nothing
throws more than see kid pollinating
plants instead of each other I gotta
tighten protective
Eric but those kids are the kids who are
now putting a lot of pumpkin patches on
top of trains we&#39;re also designing koi
ponds for the rich and affluent we&#39;re
also becoming children to the court
creating farms in the middle of Fordham
Road for awareness and window bottles
out of garbage none expect every kid to
be a farm of expect about it right about
a blog about and offer outstanding
customer service I expect meee engage
man are they so that&#39;s my incredible
classroom that&#39;s the food where does it
go zero miles to plate right down into
the cafeteria or more importantly to
local shelters where most of my kids are
getting one to two meals a day and we&#39;re
stepping it up no air jordans were ever
ruined on my farm and it is day of
million dollar gardens and incredible
installations let me tell you something
people this is a beautiful moment you
know blackfield brownfield toxic waste
field battlefield we&#39;re proving in the
Bronx that you can grow anywhere on
cement and you know we take orders for
flowers I&#39;m putting the big sale shitty
we take orders now booking for the
spring okay and these are all grown from
seeds if we&#39;re learning everything and
again when you can take kids from
backgrounds as diverse as this to do
something as special as this we&#39;re
really creating a moment now you may ask
about these kids forty percent
attendance to ninety-three percent
attendants all start over age and under
credit they are now my first cohort is

slushy malt liquor okay my dear friend
