بۆ نوێبوونەوەیەك لە ڕووخسارتدا هاتوویتە دەرەوە
هاوکۆلیژەکانت ڕووبەڕووت دەبنەوە کە موشتومڕێکی مەزنیان کردووەو هەست بەهەموو شتێك دەکەن کا تێك تۆ

the back to something that you didn&#39;t
think about today
something so close to home
the polly don&#39;t think about it very
often at all
that&#39;s at all the sensations
decisions and actions
army by the computer in your head
codebreakers
the freemen i would like much from the
outside
four pounds of pinkish gray flush
amorphis
but the last hundred years and there are
signs of a lot of the zoom in the brain
and to see
intricacy what lie to them and they told
us
that this brain
it&#39;s an incredibly complicated circuit
there&#39;s hundreds of billions ourselves
called neurons
as human design computer where there&#39;s a
fairly small man richard parts we know
how they work
because we humans design
the brain is made of thousands of
different
kinds of stuff maybe tens of thousands
they come in different shapes
to meet up different modules
and the projects can connect to
different
brain regions and they also take
different ways and if it is the states
s_a_t_ concrete
physical selves
for small selvam to betray some of the
quiet since they first
it&#39;s when the cells that seem to be
atrophied in disorders like
schizophrenia
combative style
and the cell one of the thousands of
crisis all that we are
learning about new ones rediscovered
businesses like an example
he&#39;s traveled selves
large suffix span
assitant faction brain excitatory
these are some other cells that might be
over
in disorders
such as a plus
every one of these cells
is an incredible
electrical device
they receive inputs from thousands of
upstream partners and
computer phonological outputs
if they pass a certain factual
will go to thousands of dancing partners
and this process which takes just you
know a millisecond urself
thousands of times omitted every one of
your hundred billion styles
as long as you live
how we&#39;re gonna figure out
what the circuit dots ideally we could
go to the circuit and turned these
different kinds of cell on and off
and see whether we can figure out which
ones
kochi to certain functions which one
store on uncertain pathologies
reacted itself and see what powers
the completion of the can initiate and
sustain a veto off
we could try and fear they&#39;re necessary
for
history i&#39;m gonna tell you about
and i see where we&#39;ve gone through over
the last eleven years than attempt to
find ways to turning
circuits and cells and parts and profits
the brain on and off
both understand
the science
and also
some of the issues
that this is all siemens
but right at the technology
the bad news is that uh... pacific
infraction of arts in this room
between live long enough will encounter
perhaps brain disorder
amerasian billion people
uh... some kind of resorting to
prosecute stuff
and numbers don&#39;t do a justice though
these disorders schizophrenia
alzheimer&#39;s depression diction they
don&#39;t steal their time to live
they change we are to take her identity
and change our motions
change we are as people
the twentieth century
there was some hope those generated
through live element to pharmaceuticals
retreating brain disorders
and while many drugs have been developed
that can be viewed symptoms
a brain disorders
practically none of them can be
considered to be cured
and part that&#39;s because
do you think about it would be going to
bring in the chemical this elaborate
circuit we have thousands of a kind of
cell
is being days and substance
that&#39;s also white
perhaps most of the drugs not on the
market can present some kind of serious
side effects to
now some people have gotten some
source from
political stability in front of the
brain
for parkinson&#39;s disease cochran plants
these have indeed been able to
uh... bring some kind of remedy to
people with certain kinds of disorder
uh... literacy also will go in all
directions the path of least these
resistance which is kinda where that
freeze in part comes from
and also affect normal circuit as
wealthy abnormal ones
they want a fixer again
brick sent back to the idea of ultra
precise control compiling information
precisely where we want to go
so westerners science
eleven years ago
by between two as much a punch and
assist us
and the first i thought i was looked at
these neurons are logical devices
all when you do
is to find some way
of driving the political changes at a
distance if we could try electricity
oneself but not its neighbors
douglas that&#39;s what we need to activate
and shut down these different
self-care they do and how to contradict
the networks which they&#39;re in bed
and also it allows to have the culture
says control we need
inorder said fix the circuit
competitions
they&#39;ve gone awry
how to do that
well too many models
basis in nature
which are be bored to convert weights
conflict first
you can think them as little proteins
that like solar cells
every install these models in nara
somehow
then these neurons to become politically
struggle with white and the neighbors
which don&#39;t have a small kal
there&#39;s one other matter to me to make
this all happen
and that&#39;s really gotten weight into the
brain
into that
brain doesn&#39;t feel pain you can put
kiki badge of all of the effort that&#39;s
gone into the international committee
shins and so on
optical fibers capital easier is that
you can use to activate
in a role models for example
and preclinical studies
these neurons and see what they did
how do we do this
run two thousand four incl aberration
with your novel published rock
vision came to fruition
there&#39;s a certain alga
that swims in the wild and he&#39;s not hit
or slight north or sympathize
in it senses like will i spot which
works not unlike how r iris
misnumbering
board boundary
it contains
little proteins
that indeed can convert lights
influx of city
so these models are cultural dobson&#39;s
in diffuse proteins extras like that
solar cell
they told you about one blue light hits
it
it was a little hole
and allows charged particles and to the
ice bock and that allows
the spice plot to have a little signal
just like a source alternative about her
so do you do is to take these models
and so now installed in the mirror too
because it&#39;s a protein
it&#39;s uncalled for
in the d_n_a_
saw what i do think that d_n_a_
printer gene therapy backed up with the
virus
and put it into your house
turned out that this is a very
productive time in gene therapy in lots
of ice is becoming a lot to the side to
be
traceable do and early in the morning
uh... one day in the summer of two
thousand four we give it a try it worked
on the first right
it interests you name printed in dhahran
dinner on uses its natural twitching
making machinery
to fabricate this little
but since the proteins and install them
all of us all that means four panels
like the roof
and next thing you know
you have a neuron
which can be active fight
so it&#39;s very powerful
what interests you have to do is to
figure out how
to deliver
these genes to cells that you want and
not all the other neighbors side
and you can do that you can tweak the
viruses we had just some cells
and not others
there&#39;s other tactics to complain
in order to get what activated
the skill is now come to be known as not
to genetics
n dis is one example of the president
get into the complex at work
usually fire support for the gene just
one kind of cell understands that work
and then we&#39;ve shine a light
on the internet work just that&#39;s all
type of the appetite three samples of
cancer that baskets are talking about
earlier
the one that&#39;s atrophied in
schizophrenia and the one that
is into the car
if we can deliver alleging that the
cells and there not be altered by the
expression which equals
and foss polite over the entire
brain network
just the cells
are gonna be driven
i&#39;m annoyed turns off the cells go back
to normal so they don&#39;t seem to be
understands that
now we can use a study with the cells do
with their powers and competing in the
brain
because also use this to try and figure
out well maybe we can just up to
activities all seventy thereafter
now at a couple short stories
about how using this
both the scientific
clinic one preclinical levels
when the questions that we&#39;ve confronted
is one of the singles the brain that
mediate cessation of awards
because he could find those
who should be some of the signals the
contrive learning write the final do
more whatever dot that works
and also these are signals that go awry
in disorders such as addiction
so we could figure out what sells they
are pretty fine new targets for which
drugs can be designed or screened
against
or maybe places for elections to be put
in for people who have very severe
disability
so you&#39;ve got beat him with a very
simple paradigm of coverage of the fear
or group
where one side of this little box
if you will go with a realtor possibly
board make different cells the princess
of flight
so if these cells can be here were the
animal should go there more and more
and so that&#39;s what happens this animals
who go to the right hand side
and focus now is there and you could
possibly to return to does that they
will do that hundreds
and hundreds of times he&#39;s adobe not
just to name a word about the some of
the pleasure centers in the brain now
we&#39;ve shown that a brief activation of
these is enough indeed to drive
now can generalize the idea
instead of one point the brain
reading device the places that spanned
the brain i can&#39;t deliver light into
three-dimensional patterns burris
optical fibers each couple tunes own
independent mitchell excerpts
and then we can try to do things in
devoted avoid them done to date in a
dish
eclectic at screening
throughout the entire braid for the
signal second pause
certain things happen for that to be
good clinical targets for treating
brain disorders
and went through it&#39;s laid out is helped
me find targets for treating
poster that extra sizzler
a form of uncontrolled
anxiety and fear
and one of things that we did was
adopted
heat very classical
model bustier this was back notes back
to the
comparable the indecent talkable impure
conditioning
we&#39;re told and for the brief shot shop
is a painful before going
and overtime
this case a mouse which is a good handle
model commonly used such experiments
emma learns if you&#39;re the top the animal
react
by freezing so look at the er
and headlights
now the question is what targets the
brinkley fine
so i was to overcome
so we do
physically that tone again after it&#39;s
been associated with the air bowie
activate targets the brain differ one
season that optical fiber it&#39;s what you
about in the previous life importer
transit which targets can cause
the brained over com
that memory of fear
and so this piece of your shoes you one
of these targets that were working on
now
as an area that people apart extra
region where continues commission trying
to overcome
personal emotional states
there was a leader tone
the flashlight occurred there
there&#39;s no audio on this but you can see
the animals freezing
the stone
used to mean bad news and we&#39;ll talk to
lower left-hand corner to concede this
animal
is about two minutes into this
and other specs clip
is just eight minutes later
and the same time for the play in later
flush again
i think there coz
right uh...
and i can see
just ten minutes and experiment
that we&#39;ve got the brain by for
documents area to overcome
expression of this fear
now over last couple years you&#39;ve gone
back to the tree of life because you
want to find ways to turn circuits in
the brain
ledoux dot to be extremely powerful even
delete
cells just for a few
no second second you can figure out what
necessary role to play
in service which they&#39;re in bed
and we&#39;ve now serving organisms from all
over the tree of life every
king of white supremacy we see fit
differently
and we found all sorts of models
so-called killer adoptions our
production to respond
to green yellow lights and the opposite
thing
of the model it&#39;s what about the fourth
of july caterpillar genotoxic
was going to sample where we think this
is going to go
consider for example
a condition like epilepsy where the
brain is overactive
now drugs still in a pocket treatment
one of the strategies is to remove part
to bring that&#39;s obviously irreversible
and that could be side effects
with adidas turnoff
that brain
for the brief out of time into a seizure
dies away
and climbs the brain to be restored his
initial state
so that the democrats system that&#39;s been
cox down into a civil status
desalination this phrase to explain this
concept where
we may be sultan city being turned off
the flight
we deem white and
and just for the time it takes a shot at
a seizure
we&#39;re hoping to be able to head off
and so we don&#39;t have the addition of the
swine but we&#39;re very excited about this
now closer one-story what you think
is another possibility which is that
maybe these molecules that he can be
able to process control to used in the
brain itself
to make a new kind of prosthetic an
optical prospect
already told you intellectual
stimulators are not uncommon
thirty five thousand people have
parkinson&#39;s keeping stimulators
implanted maybe a hundred thousand
people co cramped estrogen allow them to
hear
there&#39;s another thing we try to get
these genes and stopped
and new hope in gene therapy as the
default
their viruses like the others have said
fucken switchboard most of us around
this room house and it doesn&#39;t have a
symptoms
which i&#39;ve been using hundreds of
patients
to ever jeans into the brain and body
and so far there have not been serious
adverse effects assisted with the buyers
there&#39;s one must also in the room
the proteins insults from from algae and
bacteria and fungus is all over the tree
of life
most of us don&#39;t have promises relative
break so what is a pretty good deal to
protect the sultana tolerated women
system react
as early days he&#39;s an up-and-down humans
yet overthrew brightest studies
tryin
examined that said so far we haven&#39;t
seen overture reactions of any severity
modules or to these uh... loop
elimination
of the brain with white
took early days yet front
we&#39;re excited about it
i want to close at one story which we
think could potentially be ucla
publication
the many forms of blindness
where the photoreceptors are light
sensors better in the back of our i
and the rent of course is a complex
structure
allister minute your street address yet
more detail
the photoreceptor cells are shown here
at the top
and then the signals that are detected
by the footer sectors are transformed to
various competitions until finally
that we ourselves at the bottom gang
himself really information
where we see that as perception
in many forms of blackness there but my
student osha
or record generation
the full receptor cells
abacha peter pan destroyed
how could you tear this is not even
clear that a drug could cause this to be
restored because it&#39;s not in the drug
ubuntu
i had like to submit to the operate
the ice fortune spent and you can get
whitehaven
so what if we could just take these char
op sins of the modules installed them
on some of these other spirit sultan
convert the mental cameras
because there&#39;s so many of the sultan
knife issue to be very high-resolution
cameras
this is a murder during it&#39;s being
above flood by uh... one of our partners
on her sager desi and being
assorted fresh sliced by starr company
your starsight his father by the n_i_h_
when she hears a mouse
try to solve a main statistics armies
instead of water in the
mismo ticketmaster mover will disappear
and the golf course of the places to get
over water and go to a little platform
that&#39;s under the ellipse talk port
how much this marked this mail solve the
baeza benchley readers a brute force
searches from down every
avenue which we finally gets the popcorn
socializing vision to do it
these different my certification set me
to the trade to britain
clinton plan is for reflectance
answered being careful and take a look
at these different models we call the
generalized
powder salt slow reduce relied on the
previous fight rittick these blue white
for sensors install them onto a layer of
cells and all the retina
the back of the time
and convert them into account
dislike installing solar cells all over
those dogs make them
light-sensitive
like converts electricity aunt
so this mouse is quite a couple weeks
before this experiment they receive one
dose of this photosensitive modular
buyers and i can see the animal candy
avoid walls and go to the sole platform
and meet clyde and abuse
of its price again
n to point out the harvest season will
be able to get that far from jesus
passes animals have seen
entire lexus preclinical study
i think boats hope for the kind of
things are hoping to do
in the future
the clothes ought to point out that ross
exploring new business model for this
new culinary technology
we&#39;ve all been used force but we share
them freely with hundreds of groups all
over the world so people can study
and try to treat defense orders
and our hope is that by filling up
brain circuit to the level of
obstruction dot lets us repair equipment
engineer them
we can take them is a tropical disorders
but what about earlier
practically none of which are cured and
the twenty first century
with industry
so so most of his little dents
what the implications of the able to
control
seizures were couple up so it was white
instead of drugs
and being able to target those
specifically
is the first up
mostly completely forget her just so it
was you can now control
the brain into colors
what an on off switch
which makes every impulse going through
a brain a binary code
yes would like to confide information in
this trip for rwandan by trending topics
forces europe too
purpose that i should build
for could bring food processors work
with the brains of department functions
in
the people disabilities
and in theory that means the
dozen mild steel smells here&#39;s touches
you can model that out bells ustream
ones nserver
share now are hoping that uses as a way
of testing what morocco yds complied
certain behaviors and
certain parts of certain feelings
and easy to understand more about the
brain
does not mean that somebody could
download memories and may be able to
what&#39;s on your site or country heart now
we&#39;re down working on down
uh... some work or trying to how the
brain with reporting on the stoop so we
can record information and then drive
information back in surf computing with
the brain needs repugnant its inflation
possible
not much change a couple things thank
you
