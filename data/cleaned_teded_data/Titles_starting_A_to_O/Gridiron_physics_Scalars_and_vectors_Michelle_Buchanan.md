Fourth and nineteen, folks,
they&#39;ve gotta have a play as time&#39;s ticking away
because they&#39;ve got to stay in this ball game,
they&#39;ve got to win.
They come out lined up in the empty set,
three receivers to the right,
two to the left.
Defense looks like they&#39;re gonna to man up with no safety.

This is the exact offensive match-up that they want:
the best receiver lined up against the linebacker.
Quarterback steps back to receive the ball,
five yards deep in the gun.
He takes a snap, drops three steps,
he plants his back foot,
he&#39;s looking for an opening.
There&#39;s a blitz coming off the edge!
He steps up to avoid the rush.
He&#39;s looking down field.
He&#39;s got the inside receiver making a cut.
He&#39;s got a step on the linebacker.
Quarterback has a beat on it.
He lets the ball go,
it&#39;s in the air!
Receiver is out in front of the defender.
He&#39;s got it beat!
He&#39;s out in front, racing for the ball!
It&#39;s coming down!
He cradles it at the fifteen!
He&#39;s at the ten, five!
Touchdown!
Unbelievable play!
Now, wait a minute.
Of course, it&#39;s believable,
it&#39;s physics,
specifically the differences between scalars and vectors.
So, let&#39;s just see that replay.
&quot;Quarterback steps back to receive the ball,
five yards deep in the gun.&quot;
Stop.
See, measurements are defined as two different quantities.
Scalars are measurements with only numbers,
and vectors are measurements with direction.
For example, when that quarterback takes the snap,
he&#39;s five yards away, but from where?
Back from the line of scrimmage,
so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity.
When you add a direction,
like five yards deep,
it becomes a vector quantity.
Five yards - scalar,
five yards deep - vector.
OK, go ahead.
&quot;He takes a snap, drops three steps.
He plants his back foot, he&#39;s looking for an opening.
There&#39;s a blitz coming off the edge!
He steps up to avoid the rush.&quot;
Whoa!
Here&#39;s a difference between distance and displacement.
Distance is a measurement
without identifying where you moved.
It&#39;s a scalar quantity.
When the quarterback makes a three-step drop,
he moves about three yards back.
When he moves about another three yards forward,
when he steps up into the pocket,
so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards.
That&#39;s a distance, that&#39;s a scalar.
Now, displacement is a vector quantity,
describing about how far out of place the object is.
So the quarterback dropped back three yards
and then moved back forward three yards,
he&#39;s in the exact same place where he started.
So, his displacement is zero yards.
Distance - six yards,
displacement - zero yards.
So, let&#39;s look at what happened next.
&quot;Quarterback has a beat on it, he let&#39;s the ball go!
It&#39;s in the air!
Receiver is out in front of the defender.&quot;
Stop.
So, here&#39;s speed and velocity,
but let&#39;s just do one thing at a time.
So, speed is measurement without direction,
it&#39;s a scalar quantity.
Velocity is a vector quantity.
It is that object&#39;s speed,
but with a direction of motion.
So the receiver accelerates away,
gaining both speed and distance.
This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards.
So his average speed, in any given time,
is 10 yards/second.
The linebacker tries to keep up,
but his overall speed is slower,
he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds,
so his average speed is only 7 yards/second.
They&#39;re both traveling in a forward direction,
so their velocity is also positive.
You can&#39;t go from resting to your peak speed immediately.
You&#39;ve got to build up to it.
This is acceleration.
At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver,
but eventually the faster receiver pulls away.
That&#39;s acceleration, the change in speed over time.
Acceleration is a vector quantity.
It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity.
Like velocity, acceleration is a vector.
It happens in a direction.
So let&#39;s just look at that play just one more time.
&quot;Quarterback steps back to receive the ball,
five yards deep in the gun.&quot;
Vector!
&quot;He takes a snap, drops three steps,
he plants his back foot.
He&#39;s looking for an opening.
There&#39;s a blitz coming off the edge!
He steps up to avoid the rush.&quot;
Displacement!
&quot;He&#39;s got the inside receiver making a cut.
He&#39;s got a step on the linebacker.
The quarterback has a beat on it.
He let&#39;s the ball go!
It&#39;s in the air!
Receiver is out in front of the defender!&quot;
Velocity!
&quot;He&#39;s got it beat!
He&#39;s out in front, racing for the ball!
It&#39;s coming down!
He cradles it at the fifteen, he&#39;s at the ten, five!&quot;
Acceleration!
&quot;Touchdown! Unbelievable play!
That was a great play as time expired,
resulting in the touchdown
and ultimately the win and pure effort.&quot;
And pure science.
