so today I would like to talk with you
about bionics which is the popular term
for the science of replacing part of a
living organism with a mechatronic
device or a robot it is essentially the
the stuff of life meets machine and
specifically I&#39;d like to talk with you
about how bionics is evolving for people
with arm amputation this is our
motivation our map you tation causes a
huge disability I mean the functional
impairment is clear our hands or amazing
instruments and we lose one far less
both it&#39;s a lot harder to do the things
we physically need to do there&#39;s also a
huge emotional impact and actually I
spent as much of my time in clinic
dealing with the emotional adjustment of
patients as with the physical disability
and finally there&#39;s a profound social
impact we talk with our hands we greet
with our hands and we interact with the
physical world with our hands and when
they&#39;re missing it&#39;s a barrier arm
amputation is usually caused by trauma
with things like industrial accidents
motor vehicle collisions or very
poignant ly war there are also some
children who are born without arms
called canoodle limb deficiency
unfortunately we don&#39;t do great with
upper limb prosthetics there are two
general types they&#39;re called body
powered prosthesis which were invented
just after the Civil War refined in
World War 1 in World War two here you
see a patent for an arm in 1912 it&#39;s not
a lot different than the one you see on
my patient they work by harnessing
shoulder power so when you squish your
shoulders they pull on a bicycle cable
and that bicycle cable can open or close
a hand or hook or Bend an elbow and we
still use them commonly because they&#39;re
very robust and relatively simple
devices the state of the art is what we
call mile electric press the
cease these are motorized devices that
are controlled by little electrical
signals from your muscle every time you
contract the muscle it emits a little
electricity that you can record with
antennae or electrodes and use that to
operate the motorized prosthesis they
work pretty well for people who just
lost their hand because your hand
muscles are still there you squeeze your
hand these muscles contract you open it
these muscles contract so it&#39;s intuitive
and it works pretty well but how about
with higher levels of amputation now
you&#39;ve lost your arm above the elbow
you&#39;re missing not only these muscles
but your hand in your elbow too what do
you do well our patients have to use
very cody systems of using just their
arm muscles to operate robotic limbs we
have robotic limbs there are several
available on the market here you see a
few they contain just a hand that will
open and close a wrist rotator and an
elbow there&#39;s no other functions if they
did how would we tell them what to do
we&#39;ve built our own arm at the rehab
Institute of Chicago where we&#39;ve added
some wrist flexion and shoulder joints
get up to six motors or six degrees of
freedom and we&#39;ve had the opportunity to
work with some very advanced arms that
were funded by the US military using
these prototypes that head up to ten
different degrees of freedom including
moveable hands but at the end of the day
how do we tell these robotic arms what
to do how do we control them well we
need a neural interface a way to connect
to our nervous system or our thought
processes so that it&#39;s into it if it&#39;s
natural like for you and I well the body
works by starting a komodo command in
your brain going down your spinal cord
out the nerves into your periphery okay
and your sensations exact opposite you
touch yourself there&#39;s a stimulus that
comes up those very same nerves back up
to your brain when you lose your arm
that nervous system still works those
nerves can put out command signals and
if I tap the nerve ending on a world war
two vet he&#39;ll still feel is missing hand
so you might say let&#39;s let&#39;s go to the
brain and put put something in the brain
record signals or into the end of the
peripheral nerve record him there and
these are very exciting research areas
but it&#39;s really really hard you have to
put in hundreds of microscopic wires to
record from little tiny individual
neurons or nerve fibers that put out
tiny signals that are that are micro
volts and it was just it&#39;s just too hard
to use now and for my patients today so
we developed a different approach we&#39;re
using a biological amplifier to amplify
these nerve signals muscles muscles will
amplify the nerve signals about a
thousandfold so that we can record them
from on top of the skin like you saw
earlier so our approach is something we
call targeted reinnervation imagine with
somebody who&#39;s lost their whole arm we
still have four major nerves that go
down your arm and we take the nerve away
from your chest muscle and let these
nerves grow into it now you think closed
hand and a little section of your chest
contracts you think bend elbow a
different section contracts and we can
use electrodes or antennas to pick that
up and tell the arm to move that&#39;s the
idea so this is the first man that we
tried it on his name is Jesse Sullivan
he&#39;s just a saint of a man 54 year-old
lineman who touched the wrong wire and
had both of his arms burnt so badly they
had to be amputated the shoulder Jesse
came to us at the RIC to be fit with the
state-of-the-art devices and here you
see them i&#39;m still using that old
technology with a bicycle cable in his
right side and he picks which joint he
wants to move with those chin switches
on the left side he&#39;s got a modern
motorized prosthesis with those three
joints and he operates little pads in
his shoulder that he touches to make the
arm go and Jesse&#39;s a good crane operator
and he did okay by our standards he also
required a revision surgery on his chest
and that rig a vez the opportunity to do
targeted reinnervation so my colleague
dr. Greg Dominion did the surgery first
we cut away the nerve to his own muscle
then we took the arm nerves and just
kind of had him shift down
to his chest and closed him up and after
about three months the nerves grew in a
little bit and we could get a twitch and
after six months the nerves grew in well
and you could see strong contractions
and this is what it looks like this is
what happens when Jesse thinks open and
closed his hand or bend or straighten
your elbow you can see the movements on
his chest and those little hash marks
are where we put our antennas or
electrodes and I challenge anybody in
the room to make their chest go like
this his brain is thinking about his arm
he&#39;s not learned how to do this with the
chest there is not a learning process
that&#39;s why it&#39;s intuitive so here&#39;s
Jesse in our first little test with him
on the left hand side you see his
original prosthesis and he&#39;s using those
switches to move little blocks from one
box to the other had that arm for about
20 months so he&#39;s pretty good with it on
the right side two months after we fit
him with his targeted reinnervation
prosthesis which by the way is the same
physical arm just programmed a little
different you can see that he&#39;s much
faster and much smoother as he moves
these little blocks and we&#39;re only able
to use three of the signals at this time
then we had one of those little
surprises in science ok so we&#39;re all
motivated to get motor commands to drive
robotic arms and after a few months you
touch Jesse on his chest and he felt his
missing hand his hand sensation grew
into his chest skin probably because we
had also taken away a lot of fat so the
scan was right down on the muscle and D
nerve ated if you would his skin so you
touch Jesse here he feels his thumb you
touch it here he feels his pinky he
feels light touch down to one gram of
force he feels hot cold sharp dull all
in his missing hand or both his hand and
his chest but he can attend to either so
this is really exciting for us because
now we have a portal a portal or a way
to potentially give back sensation so
that he might feel what he touches with
his prosthetic can imagine sensors in
the hand coming up and pressing on this
new hand skin so it&#39;s very exciting
we&#39;ve also gone on with what
was initially our primary population of
people with above the elbow amputations
and here we D nerve 8 or cut the nerve
away just from a little segments of
muscle and leave others alone that give
us our up-down signals and to others
that will give us a hand open closed
signal this was one of our first
patients Chris you see him with his
original device on the left there after
eight months of use on the right in just
two months he&#39;s about I don&#39;t know four
or five times as fast with this simple
little performance metric all right so
one of the best parts of my job is
working with really great patients who
are also our research collaborators and
we&#39;re fortunate today to have Amanda
kits come and join us please welcome
Amanda kits
so Amanda would you please tell us how
you lost your arm sure in 2006 I had a
car accident and I was driving home from
work and a truck was coming the opposite
direction came over into my lane right
over the top of my car and his axle tore
my arm off okay so after your amputation
healed up and you got one of these
conventional arms can you tell me tell
us how it worked well it was a little
difficult because all I had to work with
was a by step at a tricep so for the
simple little things like picking
something up I would have to bend my
elbow and then I would have to co
contract&#39; to get it to change modes when
I did that I had to use my bicep to get
the hand to close use my tricep to get
it to open cokin tracked again to get
the elbow to work again so it&#39;s a little
slow little slow and it was very it was
it was just hard to work you had to
concentrate a whole lot okay so i think
was about nine months later that you had
the target reinnervation surgery took
another six months to have all the way
innervation then we fit her with a
prosthesis and how did that work for you
it works good I was able to use my elbow
and my hand simultaneously I could work
them just by my thoughts so I didn&#39;t
have to do any of the coking tracting
and all that little little faster was a
little faster much more easy much more
natural okay this was my goal okay for
20 years my goal was to let somebody
able to use their elbow and hand an
intuitive way and at the same time and
we now have over 50 patients around the
world who&#39;ve had this surgery including
over a dozen of our wounded warriors in
the US Armed Services the success rate
of the nerve transfers is very hot it&#39;s
like ninety six percent because we&#39;re
putting a big fat nerve on to a little
piece of muscle and it provides
intuitive control our functional testing
those little tests all show that there a
lot quicker and a lot easier and most
important thing is our pay
have appreciated it so that was all very
exciting but we want to do better okay
there&#39;s a lot of information in those
nerve signals and we wanted to get more
you can move each finger you can move
your thumb your wrist can we get more
out of it so we did some experiments
where we saturated our poor patients
with zillions of electrodes and then
have them try to do two dozen different
tasks okay from wiggle and a finger to
move in a whole arm to reaching for
something and recorded this data and
then we use some algorithms that are a
lot like speech recognition outcomes
algorithm is called pattern recognition
see and here you can see on Jesse&#39;s
chest when you just tried to do three
different things you can see three
different patterns ok but I can&#39;t I
can&#39;t put an electrode to say go there
so we collaborate with our colleagues in
University New Brunswick came up with
this algorithm control which a mannequin
now demonstrate so I have the elbow it
goes up and down I have the wrist
rotation that goes and he can go all the
way around and i have the risk election
and extension and also have a hand
closed and open Thank You minna no this
is this is a researcher but it&#39;s made
out of commercial components from here
down in a few that I&#39;ve borrowed from
around the world it&#39;s about seven pounds
which is probably what about what my arm
would weigh if I lost it right here
obviously that&#39;s heavy for Amanda and in
fact it feels even heavier because it&#39;s
not glued on the same she&#39;s carrying all
that weight through harnesses so the
exciting part isn&#39;t so much the the
mechatronics but the control and so
we&#39;ve developed a small micro computer
that is blinking somewhere behind her
back and is operating this all by the
way she trains it to use her individual
muscle signals so Amanda when you first
started using this arm how long did it
take to use it I took just about
probably three to four hours to get it
to Train
I had to hook it up to a computer so I
couldn&#39;t just train it anywhere so like
if it stopped working I just had to take
it off so now it&#39;s able to train with
just this little piece on the back I can
wear it around if it stops working for
some reason can retrain it takes about a
minute so we&#39;re really excited because
now we&#39;re getting to a clinically
practical device and that&#39;s that&#39;s where
our goal is to have something clinically
pragmatic to where we&#39;ve also had Amanda
able to use some of a more advanced arms
that I showed you earlier here&#39;s Amanda
using an arm made by decca Research
Corporation and I believe Dean came and
presented it at Tech a few years ago so
Amanda you can see has really good
control it&#39;s all the pattern recognition
and it now has a hand that can do
disparate grass what we do is have the
patient go all the way open and think
what hand grasp pattern do I want it
goes into that mode and then you can do
up to five or six different hand graphs
with this hand Amanda how many were you
able to do with the DECA arm I was able
to get four I had the key grip I had a
check grip I had a power grass and I had
a fine pinch but my favorite one was
just when the hand was open because I
work with kids and so all the time
you&#39;re clapping and singing so I was
able to do that again which was really
good that hands not so good for clapping
can&#39;t clap what this one all right so
that&#39;s exciting on where we may go with
the better mechatronics if we make them
good enough to put out on the market and
using a field trial once you watch
closely Oh
that&#39;s Claudia and that was the first
time she got to feel sensation through
her prosthetic she had a little sensor
at the end of her prosthesis that then
she rubbed over different surfaces and
she could feel different textures of
sandpaper different grits ribbon cable
as it pushed on her reinter baited hand
skin she said that when she just ran it
across the table it felt like her finger
was rocking so that&#39;s an exciting
laboratory experiment on how to give
back potentially some skin sensation but
here&#39;s another video that shows some of
our challenges this is Jessie and he&#39;s
squeezing a foam toy and the harder he
squeezes you see a little black thing in
the middle that&#39;s pushing on his skin
proportional to how hard he squeezes but
look at all the electrodes around it I
got a real estate problem I&#39;m supposed
to put a bunch of these things on there
but our little motors making all kinds
of noise right next to my electrodes so
we&#39;re really challenged on what we&#39;re
doing there the future is bright we&#39;re
excited where we are and a lot of things
we want to do so for example one is to
get rid of my real estate problem and
get better signals we want to develop
these little tiny capsules about the
size of a piece of risotto that we can
put into the muscles and to limit our
out the EMG signals so that it&#39;s not
worrying about electrode contact and we
can have the real estate open to try
more sensation feedback we want to build
a better arm okay this arm the are there
always made for the 50th percentile mail
which means they&#39;re too big for five
eighths of the world so rather than a
super strong or super fast arm we&#39;re
making an arm that is we&#39;re starting
with the 20th 25th percentile female
okay that will have hand that wraps
around opens all the way two degrees of
freedom and a wrist and elbow so it&#39;ll
be the smallest and lightest and the
smartest I&#39;ve ever made once if we can
do it that small it&#39;s a lot easier
making them bigger so those are just
some of our goals and we really
appreciate y&#39;all being here today I&#39;d
like to tell you a little bit about the
dark side with yesterday&#39;s theme so
Amanda came
jet lag she&#39;s using the arm and
everything goes wrong idea there was a
computer spook a broken wire a converter
that sparked we took out a whole circuit
in the hotel and just about put on the
fire alarm and none of those problems
could I have dealt with but I have a
really bright research team and
thankfully dr. Annie Simon was with us
and worked really hard yesterday to fix
it that&#39;s science unfortunately the work
today so thank you very much
you
