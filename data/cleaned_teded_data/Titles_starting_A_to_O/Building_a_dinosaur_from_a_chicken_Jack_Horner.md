when I was growing up in Montana I had
two dreams I wanted to be a
paleontologist a dinosaur
paleontologists and I wanted to have a
pet dinosaur and so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve
been striving for all of my life I was
very fortunate early in my career I was
fortunate in finding things I wasn&#39;t
very good at reading things in fact I
don&#39;t read much of anything
I am extremely dyslexic and so reading
is the hardest thing I do but instead I
go out and I find things now I just pick
things up I basically you know practice
for finding money on the street and I
wander about the hills and and I have
found a few things and I have been
fortunate enough to find things like the
first eggs in the Western Hemisphere and
the first baby dinosaurs in nests and
the first dinosaur embryos and massive
accumulations of bones and it happened
to be at a time when people were just
starting to begin to realize that
dinosaurs weren&#39;t the big stupid green
reptiles of that people had thought for
so many years and people were starting
to get an idea that dinosaurs were
special and so at that time I was able
to make some interesting hypotheses
along with my colleagues we were able to
actually say that dinosaurs based on the
evidence we had that dinosaurs built
nests and lived in colonies and cared
for their young brought food to their
babies and traveled in gigantic herds so
it was it was pretty interesting stuff I
have gone on to find more things and and
discover that that dinosaurs really were
very social
we have found
a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed
from when they are juveniles to when
they&#39;re adults the appearance of them
would have been different which it is in
all social animals in social groups of
animals the juveniles always look
different than the adults the adults can
recognize the juveniles the juveniles
can recognize the adults and so we&#39;re
making a better picture of what a
dinosaur looked like and they didn&#39;t
just all chase jeeps around but it is
that social thing that that I guess
attracted Michael Crichton in his book
he talked about the social animals and
then Steven Spielberg of course depicts
these dinosaurs as being very social
creatures the theme of this story is
building a dinosaur and so we come to
that part of Jurassic Park this is you
know Michael Crichton really was one of
the first people to talk about bringing
dinosaurs back to life you all know the
story right I mean I assume everyone
here has seen Jurassic Park if you want
to make a dinosaur you go out you find
yourself a piece of petrified tree sap
otherwise known as amber that has some
blood sucking insects in it good ones
and you get your insect you drill into
it and you suck out some DNA because
obviously all insects that suck blood in
those days suck dinosaur DNA out and and
you take your DNA back to the laboratory
and you clone it and I guess you inject
it into maybe an ostrich egg or
something like that and then you wait
and lo and behold out pops a little baby
dinosaur and everybody&#39;s happy about
that
and they&#39;re happy over and over again
they keep doing it they just keep making
these things and and then they then then
and then you know then the dinosaurs
being social act out their social
niskanen and of course that&#39;s what makes
Steven Spielberg&#39;s movie conspiring
dinosaurs chasing people around I assume
everybody knows that if you actually had
a piece of amber and it had an insect in
it and you drilled into it and you got
something out of that insect and you
cloned it and you did it over and over
and over again you&#39;d have a room full of
mosquitoes right or maybes and probably
a whole bunch of trees as well now if
you want dinosaur DNA I say go to the
dinosaur so that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done back
in 1993 when the movie came out we
actually had a grant from the National
Science Foundation to attempt to extract
DNA from a dinosaur and we chose the
dinosaur on the left a Tyrannosaurus Rex
which was a very nice specimen and one
of my former doctoral students dr. Mary
Schweitzer actually had the background
to do this sort of thing and so she
looked into the bone of this t-rex one
of the thigh bones and she actually
found some very interesting structures
in there they found these red circular
looking objects and they looked for all
the world like red blood cells and
they&#39;re in what appeared to be the blood
channels that go through the bone and so
she thought well what the heck so she
sampled some material out of it there
wasn&#39;t DNA she didn&#39;t find DNA but she
did find theme which is the biological
foundation of hemoglobin and that was
really cool but that was interesting and
that was here we have 65 million year
old heme
well we tried and tried and we couldn&#39;t
really get anything else out of it so a
few years went by and then we started
the help Creek project and how Creek
project was this massive undertaking to
get as many dinosaurs as we could
possibly find and hopefully find some
dinosaurs that had more material in them
and out in eastern Montana there&#39;s a lot
of space a lot of Badlands and not very
many people and so you can go out there
and find a lot of stuff and we did find
a lot of stuff we found a lot of
tyrannosaurs but we found one special
Tyrannosaur and we called it be rex and
be rex was found under a thousand cubic
yards of rock it wasn&#39;t a very complete
t-rex and it wasn&#39;t a very big t-rex but
it was a very special B Rex I and my
colleagues cut into it and we were able
to determine by looking at lines of
rested growth some lines in it that B
Rex had died at the age of 16 we don&#39;t
really know how long dinosaurs live
because we haven&#39;t found the oldest one
yet but this one died at the age of 16
we gave samples to Mary frights her and
she was actually able to determine that
B Rex was a female based on medullary
tissue found on the inside of the bone
medullary tissue is a calcium build up
the calcium storage basically when an
animal is pregnant when a bird is
pregnant so here was a character that
linked birds and dinosaurs but Mary went
further she took the bone and she dumped
it into acid now we all know that bones
are fossilized and so if you dump it
into acid there shouldn&#39;t be anything
left but there was something left there
were blood vessels left there were
flexible clear blood vessels and so here
was the first soft tissues from a
dinosaur was extraordinary but she also
found osteocytes which are the cells
that laid down the bones and try and try
we could not find DNA but she did find
evidence of proteins but we thought
maybe well
we thought maybe that the material was
breaking down after it was coming out of
the ground we thought maybe was
deteriorating very fast and so we built
a laboratory in the back of an
18-wheeler trailer it actually took the
laboratory to the field where we could
get better samples and we did we got
better material the cells look better
the vessels look better found the
protein collagen I mean it
it was wonderful stuff but it&#39;s not
dinosaur DNA so we have discovered that
dinosaur DNA and all DNA just breaks
down too fast we&#39;re just not going to be
able to do what they did in Jurassic
Park we&#39;re not going to be able to make
a dinosaur based on a dinosaur but birds
are dinosaurs birds are living dinosaurs
we actually classify them as dinosaurs
we now call them non-avian dinosaurs and
avian dinosaurs so the non-avian
dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that
went extinct avian dinosaurs are our
modern burns so we don&#39;t have to make a
dinosaur so I already have them
I know your your your bad as the sixth
graders right the sixth graders look at
and they say no you can call it you can
call it a dinosaur but look at the
Velociraptor the Velociraptor is cool
the chicken is not so this is our
problem as you can imagine the chicken
is a dinosaur I mean it really is I mean
you you can&#39;t argue with it because we
you know we&#39;re the classifiers and we&#39;ve
classified it that way but the sixth
graders demand it fix the chicken so so
that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to tell you about
how we&#39;re going to fix a chicken so we
have a number of of ways that we
actually can fix the chicken because
evolution works we actually have some
evolutionary tools we&#39;ll call them
biological modification tools we have
selection and we know selection works
right I mean we started out with a
wolf-like creature and we end up with a
Maltese I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s
definitely genetic modification
or any of the other funny-looking little
dogs we also have transgenesis
transgenesis is really cool too that&#39;s
where you take a gene out of one animal
and stick it in another one that&#39;s how
we know that&#39;s how people make Blowfish
you take a gene a glow gene out of a out
of a chloral or or a jellyfish and you
stick it in a zebrafish and big blow and
you know that&#39;s pretty cool
and they obviously make a lot of money
off of and now they&#39;re you know they&#39;re
making glow rabbits and do all sorts of
thing I guess we could make a glow
chicken but I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll
satisfy the sixth-graders either but
there&#39;s another thing and there&#39;s what
we call atavism activation and atom ISM
activation is basically an atavism is a
is an ancestral characteristic yeah you
you&#39;ve heard that occasionally children
are born with tails and it&#39;s because
it&#39;s an ancestral characteristic and so
there are a number of atavisms that can
happen snakes are occasionally born with
legs and here&#39;s an example this is
chicken with teeth a fellow by the name
of Matthew Harris at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison actually figured
out a way to stimulate the gene of teeth
for teeth and so was able to actually
turn the tooth gene on and produce teeth
in in chickens which now that&#39;s a good
characteristic we can we can save that
one all right we know we can use that we
can make a chicken with teeth
that&#39;s getting closer that&#39;s better than
a glowing chicken
a friend of mine a colleague of mine dr.
Hans Larsson at McGill University is
actually looking at olive isms and he&#39;s
looking at them by looking at the
embryogenesis of birds and actually
looking at how they develop and he&#39;s
interested in how birds actually lost
their tail he&#39;s also interested in the
transformation of the arm the hand to
the wing he&#39;s looking for those genes as
well and I said well you know if you can
find those I can just reverse them and
make what I need to make for the
sixth-graders and so he agreed and so
that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking into if you
look at dinosaur hands Velociraptor has
that cool-looking hand with the claws on
it
Archaeopteryx which is a bird a
primitive bird still has that very
primitive hand but as you can see the
pigeon or a chicken or anything else so
I Gabbard has kind of a weird looking
hand because the hand is a wing but the
cool thing is instead if you look in the
embryo as the embryo is developing the
hand actually looks pretty much like the
Archaeopteryx hand it has the three
fingers the three digits but a gene
turns on that actually fuses those
together and so what we&#39;re looking for
is that gene we want to stop that gene
from turning on fusing those hands
together so we can get a chicken that
hatches out with a three fingered hand
it&#39;s like the Archaeopteryx and the same
goes for the tails birds have basically
rudimentary tails and so we know that in
embryo as the animal is developing it
actually has a relatively long payoff
but a gene turns on and resorbs the tail
gets rid of it so that&#39;s the other gene
we&#39;re looking for we want to stop that
tail from resorbing so what we&#39;re trying
to do really is take our chicken modify
it
and make a chickenosaurus it&#39;s a cooler
looking chicken I mean but it&#39;s just the
very basics so that really is what we&#39;re
doing and people always say well you
know why do that why make this thing
what good is it well that&#39;s a good
question you know actually I think it&#39;s
a great way to teach kids about
evolutionary biology and developmental
biology and all sorts of things and
quite frankly I think if if Colonel
Sanders was to be careful how he worded
if he could actually advertise an extra
piece
anyway
when our Dino chicken hatches it will be
obviously the poster child or what you
might call a poster check for technology
entertainment and design thank you
