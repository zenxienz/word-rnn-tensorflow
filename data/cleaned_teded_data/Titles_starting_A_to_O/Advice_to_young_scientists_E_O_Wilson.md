what I&#39;m going to do is to just give a
few notes and this is from a book i&#39;m
preparing called letters to a young
scientist and i thought it&#39;d be
appropriate to present it on the basis
that i have had extensive experience in
teaching counseling sciences across the
broad array of field and you might like
to hear some of the principles that i&#39;ve
developed in doing that teaching and
counseling so let me begin by urging you
particularly you on the youngster side
on this path you&#39;ve chosen and to go as
far as you can the world needs you badly
humanity is now fully into the sectional
scientific age there&#39;s going to be no
turning back although varying among
disciplines say astrophysics molecular
genetic immunology the microbiology the
public health to the new area of the
human body of the symbiont to public
health environmental science knowledge
in medical science and science overall
is doubling every 15 to 20 years
technology is increasing at a comparable
rate between them the two already
pervade as most of you here seated
realize every dimension of human life so
Swift is the velocity of the technical
scientific revolution so startling and
its countless twists and turns that no
one can predict its outcome even a
decade from the present moment there
will come a time of course when the
exponential growth of discovery and
knowledge which actually began in the
1600s has to peak and level off but
that&#39;s not going to matter to you the
revolution is going to continue for at
least several more decades it will run
the human condition radically different
from what it is today traditional fields
of study are going to continue to grow
and in so doing inevitably they will
meet and create new disciplines in time
all of science will come to be a
continuum of description and explanation
of networks of principles and laws
that&#39;s why you need not just be training
in one specialty but also acquire breath
in other fields related to an even
distance from your own initial choice
keep your eyes listed and your head
turning the thirst for knowledge is in
our genes it was put there by our
distant ancestors who spread across the
world and it&#39;s never going to be
quenched to understand and use it sanely
as a part of the civilization yet to
evolve requires a vastly larger
population of scientific trained people
like you in education medicine law
diplomacy government business and the
media that exists today our political
leaders need at least a modest degree of
scientific literacy which most badly
lacked today no applause please it will
be better for all if they prepared
before entering office rather than
learning on the job therefore you will
do well to act on the side no matter how
far into the laboratory you make go on
to serve as teachers during the span of
your career I&#39;ll now proceed quickly and
before else to a subject that is both a
vital asset a potential barrier to a
scientific career if you are a bit short
in mathematical skills don&#39;t worry many
of the most successful scientists at
work today are mathematically
semi-literate a metaphor will serve here
where elite mathematicians and
statisticians and theorists often serve
as architects in the expanding
own of science the remaining large
majority of basic Applied Sciences
including a large portion of those that
could be said to be of the first rank of
the ones who map the terrain they
scalped the frontiers they cut the
pathways they raised the buildings along
the way some maybe they have considered
me foolhardy but it&#39;s been my habit to
brush aside the fear of mathematics from
talking to candidates scientists during
41 years of teaching biology at Harvard
i watch sadly as bright students turned
away from the possibility of a
scientific career or even from taking
nan required courses in science because
they were afraid of failure these math
bulbs deprived science and medicine of
immeasurable amounts of badly needed
talent here&#39;s how to relax your
anxieties if you have them understand
that mathematics is the language ruled
like other verbal languages unlike
verbal language generally by its own
grammar and system of logic any person
with average quantitative intelligent
intelligence who learns to read and
write mathematics at an elementary level
will as in verbal language have little
difficulty picking up most of the
fundamentals if they choose to master
the math speak of most disciplines of
science the longer you wait to become at
least semi literate the harder language
of mathematics will be to master just as
again in any verbal language but it can
be done at any age I speak as an
authority on that subject because I&#39;m an
extreme case I didn&#39;t take algebra until
my freshman year at the University of
Alabama they didn&#39;t teach it before then
I finally got around the calculus was a
32 year old tenured professor at Harvard
where I SAT uncomfortably in classes
with undergraduate students a little
more than half my age a couple of them
were students in a course i was giving
on evolutionary biology a swap i
swallowed my pride
and I learned calculus I found out that
in science and all its applications what
is crucial is not that technical ability
but it is imagination and all of its
applications of the ability to form
concepts with images of entities and
processes pictured by intuition i found
out that advances in science rarely come
upstream from an ability to stand at a
blackboard and conjure images from
unfolding mathematical proposition and
equations they are instead the products
of downstream imagination leading the
hard work during which mathematical
reasoning may or may not prove to be
relevant ideas emerge when a part of the
real or imagined world is studied for
its own sake of foremost importance is a
thorough well-organized knowledge of all
that is known of the relevant entities
and processes that might be involved in
that domain you propose to enter when
something new is discovered its logical
then that one of the follow-up steps is
to find the mathematical and statistical
methods to move its analysis forward if
that step proves too difficult the
person or team that made the discovery a
mathematician can bend the added by them
as a collaborator consider the following
principle which I will modestly call
Wilson&#39;s principle number one it is far
easier for scientists including medical
researchers to acquire needed
collaboration in mathematics and
statistics than it is for mathematicians
and statisticians to find scientists
able to make use of their equations it&#39;s
important in in choosing the direction
you take in science is to find the
subject of your level at your level of
competence that interest you deeply and
focus on that keep in mind then Wilson&#39;s
second principle for every scientist
weather
searcher technician teacher manager or
businessman working at any level of
mathematical competence there exists a
discipline in science or medicine for
which that level is enough to achieve
excellence now i&#39;m going to offer
quickly several more principles that
will be useful in organizing your
education a career or if you&#39;re teaching
to how you might enhance your own
teaching and counseling of young
scientists in selecting a subject in
which to conduct original research or to
develop world-class expertise take a
part of the chosen discipline that is
sparsely inhabited judge opportunity by
how few other students and researchers
are on hand this is not the d emphasize
the essential requirement of broad
training or the value of apprentice in
yourself in ongoing research to programs
of high quality it is important also to
acquire older mentors within these
successful programs and to make friends
and colleagues of your age for mutual
support but through it all look for a
way to break out to find the field and
subject not get popular we have seen
this demonstrated already in the talks
preceding mine there is the quickest way
advances are likely to occur as measured
in discoveries per investigator per year
you may have heard the military dictum
for the gathering of armies march to the
sound of the guns in science the exact
opposite is the case march away from the
sound of the gun so Wilson principle
number three march away from the sound
of the guns observed from a distance but
do not join the fray make a fray of your
own once you have settled on especially
a specialty and the profession you can
love and you secured opportunity your
potential to succeed will be greatly
enhanced
if you study it enough to become an
expert there are thousands of
professionally delimited subjects
sprinkled through physics and chemistry
to biology and medicine and on then into
the social sciences where it is possible
in short time to acquire the status of
us and authority when the subject is
still very thinly populated you can with
diligence and hard work become the world
authority the world needs this kind of
as expertise and it rewards the kind of
people willing to acquire it the
existing information and what you eat
self discover may at first seem skimpy
and difficult to connect to other bodies
of knowledge well if that&#39;s the case
good why hard instead of easy the answer
deserve to be stated as principle number
four in the attempt to make scientific
discoveries every problem is an
opportunity and the more difficult the
problem the greater will be the
importance of its solution now this
brings me to a basic cattaraugus ation
in the way scientific discoveries are
made scientists pure mathematicians
among them follow one or the other of
two pathways first through early
discoveries a problem is identified and
a solution is sought the problem may be
relatively small for example e where
exactly in a cruise ship does the
norovirus begin to spread or larger
what&#39;s the role of dark matter in the
expansion of the universe as the answer
is sought other phenomena are typically
discovered and other questions or ask
this first of the two strategies is like
a hunter exploring a forest in search of
a particular quarry who finds other
quarries along the way the second
strategy of research is to study a
subject broadly searching for unknown
phenomena or patterns of known phenomena
like a hunter in what we call the
naturalist trance the researcher mind is
open to anything interesting
any quarry worth taking the search is
not for the solution of the problem but
for problems themselves worth solving
the two strategies of research original
research can be stated as followed in
the final principle i&#39;m going to offer
you for every problem in a given
discipline of science there exists a
species or entity or phenomenon ideal
for its solution and conversely for
every species or other entity or
phenomenon there exist important
problems for the solution of which those
particular objects of research are
ideally suited find out what they are
you&#39;ll find your own way to discover to
learn to teach the decades ahead we&#39;ll
see dramatic advances and disease
prevention general health the quality of
life all of humanity depends on the
knowledge and practice of the medicine
and the science behind it you will
master you have chosen a calling there
were common steps to give you
satisfaction at its conclusion of a life
well-lived and I thank you for having me
here tonight
you
