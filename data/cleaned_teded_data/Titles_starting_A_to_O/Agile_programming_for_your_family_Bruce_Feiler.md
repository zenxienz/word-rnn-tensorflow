so here&#39;s the good news about families
the last 50 years have seen a revolution
in what it means to be a family we have
blended families adoptive families we
have nuclear families living in separate
houses and divorced families living in
the same house but through it all the
family has grown stronger eight and ten
say the family they have today is as
strong or stronger than the family they
grew up in now here&#39;s the bad news
nearly everyone is completely
overwhelmed by the chaos of family life
every parent I know myself included
feels like we&#39;re constantly playing
defense just when our kids stop teething
they start having tantrums just when
they stopped needing our help taking a
bath they need our help dealing with
cyber stalking or bullying and here&#39;s
the worst news of all our children sense
were out of control Ellen Galinsky of
the families and Work Institute asked a
thousand children if you were granted
one wish about your parents what would
it be the parents predicted the kids
would say spending more time with them
they were wrong the kids number one wish
that their parents be less tired and
less stressed so how can we change this
dynamic are there concrete things we can
do to reduce stress draw our family
closer and generally prepare our
children to enter the world I spent the
last few years trying to answer that
question traveling around meeting
families talking to scholars experts
ranging from elite peace negotiators to
Warren Buffett&#39;s bankers to the Green
Berets I was trying to figure out what
to happy families do right and what can
I learn from them to make my family
happier I want to tell you about one
family that I met and why I think they
offer clues at 7pm on the sunday in
Hidden Springs Idaho the six members of
the star family are sitting down to the
highlight of their week the family
meeting the stars are a regular American
family would their share of regular
American family problems David is a
software engineer Eleanor takes care of
their four children ages 10 to 15
one of those kids tutors math on the far
side of town one has lacrosse on the
near side of town one has Asperger&#39;s
syndrome one has ADHD we were living in
complete chaos Eleanor said what the
Stars did next though was surprising
instead of turning to friends or
relatives they look to David&#39;s workplace
they turn to a cutting edge program
called agile development that was just
spreading from manufacturers in Japan to
startups in Silicon Valley in agile
workers are organized into small groups
and do things in very short spans of
time so instead of having executives
issue grand proclamations the team in
effect manages itself you have constant
feedback you have daily update sessions
you have weekly reviews you&#39;re
constantly changing David said when they
brought this system into their home the
family meetings in particular increased
communication decrease stress and made
everybody happier to be part of the
family team when my wife and I adopted
these family meetings and other
techniques into the lives of our than
five year old twin daughters it was the
biggest single change we made since our
daughters were born and these meetings
have this effect while taking under 20
minutes so what is agile and why why can
it help with something that seems so
different like families in 1983 jeff
suppan was a technologist at a financial
firm in New England he was very
frustrated with how software got
designed companies followed the
waterfall method right in which
executives issued order that slowly
trickled down to programmers below and
no one had ever consulted the
programmers eighty-three percent of
projects bailed they were too bloated or
two out of date by the time they were
done Sutherland wanted to create a
system where ideas didn&#39;t just percolate
down but could percolate up from the
bottom and be adjusted in real time he
read 30 years of harvard business review
before stumbling upon an article in 1986
called the new new product development
game it said that the pace of business
was quickening by the way this was 1986
and thus most successful companies were
flexible it highlighted Toyota and
cannon
and likened they&#39;re adaptable tight-knit
teams to rugby scrums a Sutherland told
me we got to that article and said
that&#39;s it in sutherlin system companies
don&#39;t use large massive projects that
take two years they do things in small
chunks nothing takes longer than two
weeks so instead of saying you guys go
off into that bunker and come back with
a cell phone or a social network you say
you go off and come up with one element
then bring it back let&#39;s talk about it
let&#39;s adapt you succeed or fail quickly
today agile is used in a hundred
countries and it&#39;s sweeping into
management suites inevitably people
began taking some of these techniques
and applying it to their families you
had blogs pop up and some manuals were
written even the sullens told me that
they had an agile Thanksgiving where you
had one one group of people working in
the food one setting the table and one
greeting visitors at the door how longs
it was like best Thanksgiving ever so
let&#39;s take one problem that families
face crazy mornings and talk about how
agile can help a key plank is
accountability so teams use information
radiators these large boards in which
everybody is accountable so the star is
in adapting this to their home created a
morning checklist in which each child is
expected to tick off chores so in the
morning I visited Eleanor came
downstairs for yourself a cup of coffee
sat in a reclining chair she sat there
genuinely kind of amiably talking to
each of our children as a one after the
other that came downstairs check the
list made themselves breakfast check the
list again put the dishes in the
dishwasher rechecked the list fed the
pets or whatever chores they had check
the list once more gather their
belongings and made their way to the bus
it was one of the most astonishing
family dynamics I have ever seen and
when i strenuously objected this would
never work in our house our kids needed
way too much monitoring Ellender looked
at me that&#39;s what I thought she said I
told David keep your work out of my
kitchen but I was wrong so I turned to
David so why does it work he said you
can&#39;t underestimate the power of doing
this and he made a checkmark he said in
the workplace adults love it with kids
it&#39;s heaven the week we introduced a
morning checklist into our house
cut parental screaming in half but the
real change didn&#39;t come till we had
these family meeting so following the
agile model we asked three questions
what worked well in our family this week
what didn&#39;t work well and what will we
agreed to work on in the week ahead
everyone throws out suggestions and then
we pick two to focus on and suddenly the
most amazing thing started coming out of
our daughters mouths what worked well
this week getting over our fear riding
bikes making our beds what didn&#39;t work
well our math sheets or greeting
visitors at the door like a lot of
parents who are we our kids are
something like the muta triangles like
thoughts and ideas go in but none ever
comes out I mean at least not that are
revealing this gave us access suddenly
to their innermost thoughts but the most
surprising part was when we turn to what
are we going to work on the week ahead
you know the key idea of agile is that
teams essentially manage themselves and
we it works in software and it turns out
that it works with kids our kids love
this process so they would come up with
all these ideas greet by visitors at the
door this week get an extra 10 minutes
of reading before bed it kicks someone
that lose desserts for a month it it
turns out by the way our girls are
little Stalin&#39;s we can&#39;t constantly have
to kind of dial them back now look
natural there&#39;s a gap between their kind
of conduct and these meetings and other
behavior the rest of the week but the
truth is it didn&#39;t really bother us it
felt like we were kind of laying these
underground cables that wouldn&#39;t light
up their world for many years to come
three years later our girls are almost
eight now we&#39;re still holding these
meetings my wife counts them among her
most treasured moments as a mom so what
did we learn the word agile entered the
lexicon in 2001 when Jeff Sutherland a
group of designers met in Utah and wrote
a 12-point agile manifesto I think the
time is right for an agile family
manifesto I&#39;ve taken some ideas from the
stars and from many other families I men
I&#39;m proposing three planks plank number
one adapt all the time when I became
apparent I figured you know what I will
send a few rules and we&#39;ll stick to them
that assumes as parents we can
anticipate every problem that&#39;s going to
arise we can&#39;t what&#39;s great about the
agile
is you build in a system of change so
that you can react to what&#39;s happening
to you in real time it&#39;s like they say
in the internet world if you&#39;re doing
the same thing today you were doing six
months ago you&#39;re doing the wrong thing
parents can learn a lot from that but to
me adapt all the time means something
deeper too we have to break parents out
of this straitjacket that the only ideas
we can try at home or ones that come
from shrinks or self-help gurus or other
family experts the truth is their ideas
are stale whereas in all these other
worlds of these new ideas to make groups
and teams work effectively let&#39;s just
take a few examples let&#39;s take the
biggest issue of all family dinner
everybody knows that having family
dinner with your children is good for
the kids but for so many of us it
doesn&#39;t work in our lives I&#39;m in a
celebrity chef in New Orleans who said
no problem I&#39;ll just time shift family
dinner I&#39;m not home can&#39;t make family
dinner we&#39;ll have family breakfast we&#39;ll
meet for a bedtime snack will make
sunday meals more important and the
truth is recent research backs him up it
turns out there&#39;s only 10 minutes of
productive time in any family meal the
rest of us taken up with take your
elbows off the table and pass the
ketchup you can take that 10 minutes and
move it to any part of the day and have
the same benefit so time shift family
dinner that&#39;s adaptability an
environmental psychologist told me if
you&#39;re sitting you know on a hard chair
on a rigid surface you&#39;ll be more rigid
if you&#39;re sitting on a cushion chair
you&#39;ll be more open she told me when
you&#39;re disciplining your children sit in
an upright chair with a cushion surface
the conversation will go better my wife
and I actually moved where we sit for
difficult conversations because i was
sitting above in the power position so
move where you sit that&#39;s adaptability
the point is there are all these new
ideas out there we&#39;ve got to hook them
up with parents so plank number one
adapt all the time be flexible be
open-minded let the best ideas win plank
number to empower your children our
instinct as parents is to order our kids
around it&#39;s easier and frankly we&#39;re
usually right there&#39;s a reason that few
systems have been more waterfall over
time than the family
but the single biggest lesson we learned
is to reverse the waterfall as much as
possible enlist the children in their
own upbringing just yesterday we were
having our family meeting and we had
voted to work on overreacting so we said
okay give us a reward and give us a
punishment okay so one of my daughters
throughout you have you get five minutes
of overreacting time all week so we kind
of like that but then our sister started
working the system she said do I get 15
minute overreaction or can i get 10 30
second overreactions i love that spend
the time however you want now give us a
put now give us a punishment okay if we
get 15 minutes of over reaction time
that&#39;s the limit every minute above that
we have to do one push up so you see
this to do this is working now look this
system isn&#39;t lacs there&#39;s plenty of
parental authority going on but we&#39;re
giving them practice becoming
independent which of course is our
ultimate goal I&#39;m just as I was leaving
to come here tonight one of my daughters
started screaming the other one said
overreaction of reaction and started
counting and within 10 seconds it had
ended to me that is a certified agile
miracle so the pointed and by the way
research backs this up to children who
plan their own goals set weekly
schedules evaluate their own work build
up their frontal cortex and become take
more control over their lives the point
is we have to let our children succeed
on their own terms and yes on occasion
fail on their own terms I was talking to
Warren Buffett&#39;s banker and he was
chiding me for not letting my children
make mistakes with their allowance and I
said but what if they drive into a ditch
he said it&#39;s much better to drive into a
ditch with a six dollar allowance than a
sixty thousand dollar a year salary or a
six million dollar inheritance so the
bottom line is empower your children
plank number three tell your story
adaptability is fine but we also need
bedrock Jim Collins the author of good
to grey told me that successful human
organizations of any kind have two
things in common they preserve the core
they stimulate progress so agile is
great for stimulating
progress but I kept hearing time and
again you need to preserve the core so
how do you do that Collins coached us on
doing something that businesses do which
is define your mission and identify your
core values so he led us through the
process of creating a family mission
statement we did the family equivalent
of a corporate retreat we had a pajama
party I made popcorn actually I burned
one so I made to my wife bought a flip
chart and we had this great conversation
like what&#39;s important to us what values
do we most uphold and we ended up with
10 statement we are travelers not
tourists we don&#39;t like dilemmas we like
solutions again research shows that
parents should spend less time worrying
about what they do wrong and more time
focusing on what they do right where we
less about the bad times and build up
the good times this family mission
statement is a great way to identify
what it is that you do right a few weeks
later we got a call from the school one
of our daughters had gotten into a spat
and suddenly we were worried like do we
have a mean girl on our hands and we
didn&#39;t really know what to do so we
called you into my office the family
mission statement was on the wall and my
wife said so anything up there seemed to
apply and she kind of looked down the
list and she said bring people together
suddenly we had a way into the
conversation another great way to tell
your story is to tell your children
where they came from researchers at
Emory gave children as simple what do
you know test do you know where your
grandparents were born do you know where
your parents went to high school do you
know anybody in your family who had a
difficult situation and illness and they
overcame it the children who scored
highest on this do you know scale had
the highest self esteem and a greater
sense they could control their lives the
do you know test was the single biggest
predictor of emotional health and
happiness as the author of the study
told me children who have a sense of
their part of a larger narrative have
greater self confidence so my final
plank is tell your story spend time
retelling the story of her family&#39;s
positive moments and how you overcame
the negative ones if you give children
this happy narrative you
give them the tools to make themselves
happy I was a teenager when I first read
Anna Karenina and its famous opening
sentence all happy families are alike
each unhappy family is unhappy in its
own right when I first read that i
thought that sentence is a name of
course all happy families aren&#39;t alike
but as I began working on this project I
began changing my mind recent
scholarship has allowed us for the first
time to identify the building blocks
that successful families have i&#39;ve
mentioned just three here today adapt
all the time empower the children tell
your story is it possible all these
years later to say Tolstoy was right the
answer I believe is yes Leo Tolstoy was
five years old his brother Nikolai came
to him and said he had engraved the
secret to universal happiness on a
little green stick which he had hidden
in a ravine on the family&#39;s estate in
Russia if the stick were ever found all
humankind would be happy Tolstoy became
consumed with that stick but he never
found it in fact he asked to be buried
in that ravine where he thought it was
hidden he still lies there today covered
in a layer of green grass that story
perfectly captures from me the final
lesson that I learned happiness is not
something we find it&#39;s something we make
almost anybody who&#39;s looked at well-run
organizations has come to pretty much
the same conclusion greatness is not a
matter of circumstance it&#39;s a matter of
choice you don&#39;t need some grand plan
you don&#39;t need a waterfall you just need
to take small steps accumulate small
wins keep reaching for that green stick
in the end this may be the greatest
lesson of all what&#39;s the secret to a
happy family try
you
