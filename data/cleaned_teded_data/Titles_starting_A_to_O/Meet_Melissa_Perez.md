My name is Melissa Perez.
I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York City,
but my parents are Mexican.
Two years ago, graduating high school
was not even in my plans.
I was doing horribly in school.
Going to a school that has metal detectors is stressful.
You have to stand in line 25 minutes to an hour.
I would only go in third period
and come out fourth.
I went third period
because I knew they didn&#39;t take attendance first and second.
So, basically, if you were going third period,
they would mark you present for the whole day.
I just wasn&#39;t interested in school.
Then, when I was 17,
I gave birth to my daughter, Madeline.
Getting pregnant changed my approach tremendously.
I thought, &quot;I&#39;m pregnant, I don&#39;t have a diploma.
So what I am I going to be working the rest of my life?
$7.25 an hour?
No! I have to graduate and go to college.&quot;
Being a mom, still going to high school is, ummm,
overwhelming, I would say, at the beginning,
but I had this math teacher who encouraged me
to go on with school.
She always said that she saw something in me.
She was like, &quot;I know there&#39;s something inside you there
that wants to fight for it.&quot;
She always pushes me,
she always gives me the hard questions
because she knows that my favorite subject is math.
She&#39;s always like, &quot;Melissa, figure this out.
Melissa, figure that out.&quot;
And I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, okay.&quot;
I like that about her
because she always tends to push me.
Thelma is the first teacher
that has treated me,
you know,
I guess, special.
After I had my baby, I got my head into the game
and I passed my classes.
Being a mom at a young age
either makes you or breaks you,
but, in my case, it made me.
It made me have a total different visual for my future.
I am the first person in my family
to graduate from high school.
