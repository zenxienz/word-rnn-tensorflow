having spent her 18 years as a child of
the state in children&#39;s homes and foster
care you could say that I&#39;m an expert on
the subject and in being an expert I
want to let you know that being an
expert does in no way make you right in
light of the truth if you&#39;re in care
legally the government is your parent
loco parentis Margaret Thatcher was my
mother let&#39;s not talk about
breastfeeding harry potter was a foster
child pip from great expectations was
adopted Superman was a foster child
Cinderella was a foster child Lisbeth
Salander the girl with the dragon tattoo
was fostered and institutionalized
Batman was orphaned Laira baloch were
from Philip Pullman&#39;s Northern Lights
was fostered Jane Eyre adopted roald
dahl&#39;s James from James and the Giant
Peach Matilda Moses Moses Moses the the
boys in Michael Morpurgo friends or Foe
alum in benjamin zephaniah refugee boy
Luke Skywalker Luke Skywalker Oliver
Twist Cassie in the concubine of
shanghai by honking sealy in in in Alice
Walker&#39;s color purple all of these great
fictional characters all of them who
were hurt by their condition all of them
who spawned thousands of other books and
other films all of them
were fostered adopted or orphaned it
seems that writers know that the child
outside of family reflects on what
family truly is more than what it
promotes itself to be that is they also
use extraordinary skills to deal with
extraordinary situations on a daily
basis how have we not made the
connection and why have we not made the
connection between how has that happened
between these incredible characters of
popular culture and religions and the
fostered adopted or orphaned child in
our midst it&#39;s not our pity that they
need it&#39;s our respect I know famous
musicians I know actors and film stars
and millionaires and novelists and top
lawyers and television executives and
magazine editors and national
journalists and dust bin men and
hairdressers all who were looked after
children fostered adopted or orphaned
and many of them grow into their adult
lives in fear of speaking of their
background as if it may somehow weaken
their standing in the foreground as if
it were somehow kryptonite as if it were
a a time bomb strapped on the inside
children in care who&#39;ve had a life in
care deserve the right to own and live
the memory of their own childhood it is
that simple my own mother and I should
say this here she came to this country
in in the late 60s and she she was you
know she found herself pregnant as women
did in the late sixties you know me they
found themselves pregnant and she sort
of she had no idea of the context in
which she&#39;d landed
in the 1960s I should give you some
context in the 1960s if you were
pregnant and you were single you were
seen as a threat to the community you
were separated from your family by the
state you were separated from your
family and placed it into a mother and
baby homes you were appointed a social
worker the adoptive parents were lined
up it was the primary purpose of the
social worker the aim to get the woman
at her most vulnerable time in her
entire life to sign the adoption papers
so the adoption papers were signed the
mother and babies homes were often run
by nuns the adoption papers were signed
the the the child was given to the
adoptive parents and the mother shipped
back to her community to say that she&#39;d
been on a little break a little break a
little break the first secret of shame
for a woman for being a woman a little
break the adoption process took like a
matter of months so it was a closed shop
you know seal deal an industrious
utilitarian solution government the
farmer the the adopting parents the
consumer the mother the earth and the
child the crop um it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of easy
to patronize the past to forego our
responsibilities in the present what
happened then is a direct reflection of
what is happening now everybody believed
themselves to be doing the right thing
by God and by the state for the big
society fast-tracking adoption so anyway
she comes here in 1967 she she&#39;s she&#39;s
pregnant
she comes from Ethiopia that was
celebrating its own Jubilee at the time
I&#39;m under the emperor haile selassie and
she lands months before the Enoch Powell
speech the rivers of blood speech she
lands months before the beatles released
the white album months before Martin
Luther King was killed it was a summer
of love if you were white if you were
black it was a summer of hate so she
goes from Oxford she sent to the north
of England to a mother and baby home and
appointed a social worker she it&#39;s her
plan you know I have to say this in the
house it it&#39;s her plan to have me
fostered for a short period of time
while she studies but the social worker
he had a different agenda he found the
foster parents and he said to them treat
this as an adoption he&#39;s yours forever
his name is Norman no
no um so they they they they took me I
was a message they said I was a sign
from God they said I was Norman mark
Greenwood now for the next 11 years all
I know is that this woman this birth
woman should have her eyes scratched out
for not signing the adoption papers she
was an evil woman too selfish to sign so
I spent those 11 years kneeling and
praying a tried praying I swear I tried
praying God can have a bike for
Christmas but I would always answer
myself yes Luke or she&#39;d gone and then I
was supposed to determine whether that
was the voice of God or it was the voice
of the devil and it turns out I&#39;ve got
the devil inside of me um who knew so
anyway two years sort of passed and they
had a child of their own and then
another two years passed and they had
another child of her own and then
another time passed and they had another
child that they called an accident which
I thought was an unusual name and I was
on the cusp of sort of adolescence so
I&#39;ll starting to take biscuits from the
tin without you know without asking I
was starting to stay out a little bit
late etc etc now in their religiosity in
their naivety my mom and dad which I
believe them to be forever as they said
they were my mom and dad that conceived
that um that I had the devil inside of
me and what I should say this here
because this is how they engineered my
leaving they SAT me at a table my foster
mom and she said to me you don&#39;t love us
do you 11 years old they&#39;ve had three
other children I&#39;m the fourth the third
was an accident and I said yeah of
course I do because you do I&#39;m foster
mother asked me to go away to think
about love and what it is and to read
the scriptures and to come back tomorrow
and give my most honest and truthful
answer so this was an opportunity if
they were asking me whether I love them
or not
mustn&#39;t love them which led me to the
miracle of thought that I thought they
wanted to me to get to i will ask God
for forgiveness and his light will shine
thru me to them how fantastic this was
an opportunity the theology was perfect
the timing unquestionable and the answer
as honest as a sinner could get a
mustn&#39;t love you I said to them but i
will ask God for forgiveness because you
don&#39;t love us Norman clearly you&#39;ve
chosen your path 24 24 hours later my
social worker this strange manner used
to visit me every couple of months he&#39;s
waiting for me in the car as I say
goodbye to my parents I didn&#39;t say
goodbye to anybody my mother my father
my sister&#39;s my brothers my aunt&#39;s my
uncle&#39;s my cousin&#39;s my grandparents
nobody on the way to the children&#39;s home
I started to ask myself what&#39;s happened
to me it&#39;s not that I&#39;d had the rug
pulled from beneath me as much as the
entire floor had been taken away um when
I got to do for the next 45 years I was
held in four different children&#39;s homes
on the third children&#39;s home at 15 and I
started to rebel and what I did was I
got three tins of paint airfix paint
that you use for models and and I was it
is a big children&#39;s our big Victorian
children zone when I was in a little
turret at the top of it and I toward
them red yellow and green the colors of
Africa her down the tiles you couldn&#39;t
see it from the street because the home
was surrounded by beech trees for doing
this I was incarcerated for a year in an
assessment center which was actually a
remand centre it was a virtual prison
for young people um by the way the years
later my social workers said that I
should never have been put in there
wasn&#39;t charged for anything I hadn&#39;t
done anything wrong but because I had no
family to inquire about me they could do
anything to me I&#39;m 17 years old
and they had a padded cell they would
March me down corridors in la size order
they I was put in a dormitory with a
confirmed Nazi sympathizer all of the
staff were ex-police interesting and X
probation officers the man who ran it
was an ex-army officer every time I had
a visit by a person who I did not know
who would feed me grapes once every
three months I was strip-searched that
home was full of young boys who were on
remand for things like murder um and
this was the preparation that I was
being given after 17 years as a child of
the state I have to tell the story I
have to tell it because there was no one
to put two and two together I slowly
became aware that I knew nobody that
knew me for longer than a year see
that&#39;s what family does it gives you
reference points I&#39;m not defining a good
family from a bad family I&#39;m just saying
that you know when your birthday is by
virtue of the fact that somebody tells
you when your birthday is a mother a
father a sister a brother announced an
uncle or cousin a grandparent it matters
to someone and therefore it matters to
you understand I was 14 years old
tattooing myself into myself and I
wasn&#39;t touched either physically touched
I&#39;m reporting back I&#39;m reporting back
simply to say that that a when i left
the children&#39;s home i had two things
that i wanted to do one was to find my
family and the other was to write poetry
in creativity i saw light in the
imagination I saw the endless
possibility of life the endless truth
the permanent Creation of reality the
the
v um the place where anger was an
expression in the search for love a
place where dysfunction is a true
reaction to untruth I&#39;ve just gotta say
to you all I found all of my family in
my adult life I&#39;ve spent all of my adult
life finding them I&#39;ve now got a fully
dysfunctional family just like everybody
else but I&#39;m reporting back to you to
say quite simply that you can define how
strong a democracy is by how its
government treats its child I don&#39;t mean
children I mean the child of the state
thanks very much it&#39;s been an honor
you
