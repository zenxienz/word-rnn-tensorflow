Ah, thankfully novelist was my number one,
took a while though.
Again, I worked for a couple decades nearly,
and at some point it really wasn&#39;t my goal
to become a novelist anymore.
I loved my work at the time developing software
and then I went back to it.
So, I think the thing I&#39;d say to people is
sometimes it&#39;s a very circuitous path.
I mean, I wouldn&#39;t change it in hindsight
how it happened.
I mean, I finally got to my dream profession,
but the journey was enjoyable too,
and that&#39;s what I would say.
It was definitely novelist,
I think really only that.
