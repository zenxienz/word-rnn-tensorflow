so before I became a dermatologist I i
started in general medicine as as most
dermatologists to in britain at the end
of that time I went off to Australia
about 20 years ago what you learn when
you go to Australia is the Australians
are very competitive and and they are
not magnanimous in victory and and that
happened a lot so I knew Pommies you
can&#39;t play cricket rugby I I could
accept that but moving into work and we
have each week what&#39;s called a journal
club when you&#39;d sit down with the other
doctors and you&#39;d study at a scientific
paper in relation to medicine and after
week one it was about cardiovascular
mortality a dry subject how many people
died of heart disease what the rates are
and they were competitive about this you
pom is your rates of heart disease are
shocking and of course they were right
Australians have about a third less
heart disease than we do less deaths
from heart attacks heart failure less
strokes they&#39;re generally healthier
bunch and because they said this was
because of their fine moral standing
there exercise because they&#39;re
Australians and where we easy Pommies
and so on but you know it&#39;s not just
Australia that has better health than
Britain within Britain um there is a
gradient of Health and this is what&#39;s
called standardized mortality basically
your chances of dying this is looking at
data from the paper about 20 years ago
but it&#39;s true today comparing your rates
of dying at 50 degrees north that&#39;s the
south that&#39;s London and places and by
latitude and 55 degrees the bad news is
that&#39;s here Gloucester I&#39;m from
Edinburgh worst news that&#39;s even
Edinburgh okay so there is
so what accounts for this horrible space
here between us up here in southern
Scotland and the SAP now we know about
smoking deep-fried Mars bars trips the
Glasgow tart all of these things but
this graph is after taking into account
all of these known risk factors this is
after accounting for smoking social
class diet all those other known
respects we are left with this missing
space of increased deaths the further
north you go now sunlight of course
comes into this and vitamin D has had a
great deal of press and a lot of people
get concerned about it and we need
vitamin D it&#39;s now a requirement that
children have a certain amount my
grandmother grew up in Glasgow back in
the 1920s and 30s when rickets was a
real problem and cod liver oil was
brought in and that really prevented the
rickets that used to be common in this
city and I as a child was fed cod liver
oil by my grandmother I distinctly
nobody forgets cod liver oil but an
association the higher people&#39;s blood
levels of vitamin D are the less heart
disease they have the less cancer there
seems to be a lot of data suggesting
that vitamin D is very good for you and
it is to prevent rickets and so on but
if you give people vitamin D supplements
you don&#39;t change that high rate of heart
disease and the evidence for it
preventing cancers is not yet great so
what I&#39;m going to suggest is that
vitamin D is not the only story in town
it&#39;s not the only reason preventing
heart disease high vitamin D levels I
think are a marker for sunlight exposure
and sunlight exposure in methods i&#39;m
going to show is good for heart disease
anyway I came back from Australia and
despite the obvious risks to my health I
moved to Aberdeen
now in aberdeen i started my dermatology
training but i also became interested in
research and in particular i became
interested in this substance nitric
oxide now these three guys up here
furchgott ignarro Murad won the nobel
prize for medicine back in 1998 and they
were the first people to describe this
new chemical transmitter nitric oxide
what nitric oxide does is it dilates
blood vessels so lowers your blood
pressure it also dilates the coronary
arteries that stops angina and what was
remarkable about it was in the past when
we think of chemical messengers within
the body we thought of complicated
things like eastridge run and insulin or
nerve transmission very complex
processes with very complex chemicals
that fit into very complex receptors and
here&#39;s this incredibly simple molecule
on nitrogen and an oxygen that has stuck
together and yet these are hugely
important for painting our low blood
pressure for neurotransmission for many
many things but particularly
cardiovascular health and I started
doing research and we found very
excitingly that the skin produces nitric
oxide so it&#39;s not just in the
cardiovascular system to Rises it arises
in the skin while having found that and
published that I thought well what&#39;s it
doing how do you have low blood pressure
in your skin you know it&#39;s not the heart
what do you do so I went off to the
States as many people do if they&#39;re
going to do research and I spent a few
years in Pittsburgh um this is
Pittsburgh and I was interested in these
really kind of complex systems we
thought that maybe nitric oxide affected
cell death and how cells survive and
their resistance to other things and I
first of all started working in cell
culture growing cells and then as using
knockout mouse models mice that couldn&#39;t
make the gene we worked out a mechanism
which n 0 was helping cells survive and
I then moved back to Edinburgh and in
Edinburgh the experimental animal we use
is the medical student it&#39;s a species
close to human with several advantages
over mice they&#39;re free you don&#39;t shave
them they feed themselves and nobody
pickets your office saying save the lab
medical student so there really an ideal
an ideal model
but what we found was that we couldn&#39;t
reproduce in man the data we had shown
in mice it seemed we couldn&#39;t turn off
the production of nitric oxide in the
skin of humans we put on creams that
block the enzyme that made it and we
injected things we couldn&#39;t turn off the
the matric oxide and the reason for this
it turned out after two or three years
work was in the skin we have huge stores
not of nitric oxide because nitric oxide
is a gas and it&#39;s released and a few
seconds its away but it can be turned
into these forms of nitric oxide nitrate
no.3 nitrite no.2 mitros without and
these are more stable and your skin has
got really large stores of n.o and we
then thought to ourselves with us big
stores I wonder if sunlight might
activate those stores and release them
from the skin where the stores are about
10 times as big as what&#39;s in the
circulation could the Sun activate those
stores into the circulation and they&#39;re
in the circulation and can do it&#39;s good
things for your cardiovascular system
well I&#39;m an experimental dermatologist
so what we did was we thought we have to
expose our experimental animals to
sunlight and so what we did was we took
a bunch of volunteers and we expose them
to ultraviolet light so these are kind
of Sun lamps now what we were careful to
do was vitamin D is made by ultraviolet
be raised and we wanted to separate our
story from the vitamin D story so we
used ultraviolet a which doesn&#39;t make
vitamin D when we put people under lap
for the equivalent of about 30 minutes
of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh what
we produce was refused to rise in
circulating nitric oxide so he put
patients with these subjects under the
UV and then n o levels do go up and
their blood pressure goes down not by
much as an individual level but enough
at a population level to shift the rates
of heart disease in a whole population
and when we shun UV at them or when we
warmed them up to the same level as the
Lambs but didn&#39;t actually that the Rays
hit the skin this didn&#39;t happen so this
seems to be a fee
of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin now
we&#39;re still collecting data a few good
things here whether it appeared to be
more marked in older people I&#39;m not sure
exactly how much one of the subjects
here was my mother-in-law and clearly i
do not know her age but certainly in
people older than my wife um this
appears to be a more marked effect and
the other thing i should mention was
there was no change in vitamin D this is
separate from vitamin D so vitamin DS
good view it stops rickets it provides
calcium italo&#39;s important stuff but this
is a separate mechanism from vitamin D
now one of the problems are looking at
blood pressure is your body does
everything it can to keep your blood
pressure at the same place if your leg
is dropped off and you lose blood your
body will clamp down increase the heart
rate do everything it can to keep your
blood pressure up that is an absolutely
fundamental physiological principle so
what we&#39;ve next done is we&#39;ve moved on
to looking at blood vessel dilatation so
we&#39;ve measured this is again notice no
tail and and hairless this is a medical
student okay in the arm you can measure
how blood flow in the arm by how much it
swells up as some blood flows into it
and what we&#39;ve shown is adding a sham
irradiation this is the thick line here
this is shining UV on the arms that
warms up but keeping it cupboards the
Rays don&#39;t hit the skin there is no
change in blood flow in in dilatation of
the blood vessels but the active
irradiation during the UV and for an
hour after it there is dilation of the
blood vessels this is the mechanism by
which you lower blood pressure by which
you dilate the coronary arteries also to
let the blood be supplied with heart so
here further data that ultraviolet that
sunlight has benefits on the blood flow
and the cardiovascular system so we
thought we&#39;d just kind of model a
different amounts of UV hit the earth at
different parts of the earth at
different times of year so you can
actually work out those stores of nitric
oxide the nitrates nitrites might Rosa
tiles on the skin release a cleave to
release n 0 different wavelengths of
light have different activities at doing
that so you can look at the wavelengths
of light that do that and you can look
so if you live on your equator the Sun
comes straight overhead it comes to if I
thin bit of atmosphere and winter or
summer it&#39;s the same amount of light if
you live up here in summer Sam&#39;s coming
fairly directly down but in winter it&#39;s
coming through a huge amount of
atmosphere and much of the ultraviolet
is weeded out and that range of
wavelengths earth are different in
summer to winter so what you can is you
can multiply those data by the n.o
that&#39;s released and you can calculate
how much nitric oxide would be released
from the skin into the circulation now
if you&#39;re on the equator here that&#39;s
these two lines here the red line and
the purple line and the amount of nitric
oxide that&#39;s released is the area under
the curve is the area in this space here
so if you&#39;re on the equator December or
June we&#39;ve got masses of n.o being
released from the skin so Ventura is in
Southern California in summer you might
as well be equator it&#39;s great lots of
n.o is released Ventura midwinter well
there&#39;s still you know a decent amount
edinburgh in summer the area beneath the
curves really good but edinburgh in
winter you know the amount of air know
that can be released is next to nothing
tiny amounts so what do we think we&#39;re
still working at the story we&#39;re still
developing it with syl expanding it we
think it&#39;s very important and we think
it probably accounts for a lot of the
north-south health divide within Britain
its relevance to us we think that the
skin well we know that the skin has got
very large stores of nitric oxide as is
tver of the forms we suspect a lot of
these come from diet green leafy
vegetables beetroots lettuce has a lot
of these nitric oxide that we think go
to the skin we think they&#39;re then stored
in the skin and we think the sunlight
releases this where it has generally
beneficial effects and this is ongoing
work but I mean dermatologists I&#39;m and
I&#39;m a dermatologist my day job is saying
to people you&#39;ve got skin cancer is
caused by sunlight don&#39;t go in the Sun I
actually think a far more important
message is that there are benefits as
well as risks to sunlight yes sunlight
is the is the major alterable risk
factor for skin cancer but deaths from
heart disease are a hundred times higher
than deaths from skin cancer and I think
that we need to be more aware of and we
need to find the riff
benefit ratio how much sunlight is safe
how can we kind of finesse this best for
our general health so thank you very
much indeed
