the future as we know is very
unpredictable the best minds in the best
institutions generally get it wrong this
is in technology this is in the area of
politics where pundits the CIA mi6
always get it wrong and it&#39;s clearly in
the area of Finance with institutions
established to think about the future
the IMF the B I ask the financial
stability forum couldn&#39;t see what was
coming over 20,000 economists who job it
is competitive entry to get there
couldn&#39;t see what was happening
globalization is getting more complex
and this change is getting more rapid
the future will be more unpredictable
urbanization integration coming together
leads to new Renaissance it did this a
thousand years ago the last 40 years
have been extraordinary times life
expectancy has gone up by about 25 years
it took from the Stone Age to achieve
that income has gone up for majority of
the world&#39;s population despite the
population going up by about two billion
people over this period and illiteracy
has gone down from 1/2 to about a
quarter the people on earth a huge
opportunity unleashing of new potential
for innovation for development but
there&#39;s an underbelly there to Achilles
heels of globalization there&#39;s the
killer&#39;s heel of growing inequality
those that are left out those that feel
angry those that are not participating
globalization has not been inclusive the
second Achilles heel is complexity a
growing fragility a growing brittleness
what happens in one place very quickly
affects everything else this is systemic
risk systemic shop we&#39;ve seen it in the
financial crisis we&#39;ve seen it in the
pandemic flu it will become virulent and
it&#39;s something we have to build
resilience again a lot of this is driven
by what&#39;s happening on technology
there&#39;s been huge leaps there will be a
million fold improvement in what you can
get for the same price in computing by
2030 that&#39;s what the experience of the
last 20 years has been it will continue
our computers our systems will be as
primitive as the Apollo&#39;s are for today
our mobile phones are more powerful in
the total Apollo space engine our mobile
phones are more powerful that&#39;s when the
strongest computers of 20 years ago so
what will this do it will create huge
opportunities in technology
miniaturization as well there will be
invisible capacity invisible capacity in
our bodies in our brains and in the air
this is a dust mite on a nano replica
this sort of ability to do everything in
new ways unleashes potential not least
in the area of medicine this is a stem
cell that we&#39;ve developed here in Oxford
from a embryonic stem cell we can
develop any part of the body
increasingly over time this will be
possible from our own skin able to
replicate parts of the body fantastic
potential for regenerative medicine I
don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be a Special
Olympics long after 2030 because of this
capacity to regenerate parts of the body
but the question is who will have it the
other major development is going to be
in the area of what can happen on
genetics the capacity to create as this
mouse has been genetically modified
something which goes three times faster
lasts for 3 times long and we can
produce as this mouse count the age of
our equivalent of 80 years with using
about the same amount of food but will
this only be available for the
super-rich for those that can afford it
are we heading for new eugenics we&#39;ll
only those that are able to afford it
able to be the super race of the future
so the big question for us is how do we
manage this technological change how do
we ensure that it creates a more
inclusive technology a technology which
means that not only as we grow older but
we can also grow wiser and that we able
support the populations of the future
one of the most dramatic manifestations
of these improvements will be moving
from population pyramids to what we
might term population coffins
there&#39;s unlikely to be a pension or
retirement age in 2030 these will be
redundant concepts and this isn&#39;t only
something of the West the most dramatic
changes will be the skyscraper type of
new pyramids that will take place in
China and in many other countries so
forgetting about retirements if you&#39;re
young forget about pensions think about
life and where it&#39;s going to be going of
course migration will become even more
important the war on talent the need to
attract people at all skill ranges to
push us around in our wheelchairs but
also to drive our economies on an
innovation
Vital the employment in the rich
countries will go down for about 800 to
700 million of these people this would
imply a massive leap in migration so the
concerns the xenophobic concerns of
today on migration will be turned on
their head as we search for people to
help us sort out our pensions and our
economies in the future and then the
systemic risks we understand that these
will become much more virulent that what
we see today is this interweaving of
societies of systems fastened by
technologies in patient by just-in-time
management systems small levels of stock
push resilience into other people&#39;s
responsibility the collapse in
biodiversity climate change pandemics
financial crises these will be the
currency that we will think about and so
the new awareness will have to arise of
how we deal with these how we mobilize
ourselves in a new way and come together
as a community to manage systemic risk
it&#39;s going to require innovation it&#39;s
going to require an understanding that
the glory of globalization could also be
its downfall this could be our best
century ever because of the achievements
or it could be our worst and of course
we need to worry about the individuals
particularly the individuals that feel
that they&#39;ve been left out in one way or
another an individual for the first time
in the history of humanity will have the
capacity by 2030 to destroy the planet
to wreck everything through the creation
for example of a bio pathogen how do we
begin to weave these tapestries together
how do we think about complex systems in
new ways that will be the challenge of
the scholars and of all of us are
engaged in thinking about the future
the rest of our lives will be in the
future we need to prepare for it now we
need to understand that the governance
structure in the world is fossilized it
cannot begin to cope with the challenges
that this will bring we have to develop
a new way of managing the planet
collectively through collective wisdom
we know and I know from my own
experience that amazing things can
happen when individuals and societies
come together to change their future I
left South Africa and 15 years later
after thinking I would never go back we
have the privilege in the honour to work
in the government to Nelson Mandela this
was a miracle we can create miracles
collectively in our lifetime it is vital
that we do so despite let the ideas that
nurtured intead that the ideas that we
think about look forward and make sure
that this will be the most glorious
century and not one of eco disaster
Anika collapse thank you
