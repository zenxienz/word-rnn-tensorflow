I would like to talk to you about why
many EF projects fail and I really think
that the most important thing of it is
that we stopped listening to patients
and one of the things we did at Robert
university is reappointed a chief
listening officer not on a very
scientific way she puts up a little cup
of coffee or a cup of tea and ask
patients family relatives what&#39;s up how
could we help you and we think we like
to think that this is one of the major
problems why all maybe not all about
most of the EF projects Phil since we
stopped listening this is my waiting
skill it&#39;s a very simple thing it&#39;s got
one nut on off and every morning I hop
on it and yes I got a challenge as you
might see and I put my challenge on 95
kilograms but the thing is that it&#39;s
made this simple that whenever I hop on
it sends my data through google health
as well and it&#39;s collected by my general
petitioner as well so he can see what&#39;s
my problem in weight not on the very
moment that I need Kyle your logic
support us in something like it but also
looking back for it but there&#39;s another
thing as some of you might know I got
more than 4,000 follows on twitter so
every morning I hop on my weight scale
and before I&#39;m in my car people start
talking to me I think you need a light
lunch today we shall but that&#39;s the
nicest thing that could happen since
this is peer pressure peer pressure used
to help patients since this could be
useful vistas it could be used to stop
smoking for patients but on the other
hand it also could be used to get people
from out of their chairs and try to work
together in some kind of gaming activity
to get more control of the health when
ourselves next week it will be soon
available there will be this little
blood pressure meter connected to an
iphone or something error other and
people will be able from their homes to
take their blood pressure send it in to
the doctor and eventually share it to
others friends
for over a hundred dollars and this is
the point where patients get into
position and can&#39;t collect not only
their own control again being captain of
the old ship but also can help us in
health care due to the challenges that
we face it like health care costs
explosion double demand and things like
that make techniques that&#39;s easy to use
and start with this to embrace patients
in the team and you could do this with
techniques like this but also by
crowdsource and one of the things we did
I would like to share with you
introduced by little video
we all got navigation controls in our
car we maybe even got it in our cell
phone we perfectly know where all the
adms are just about the city of
Maastricht the other thing is we know
where all the gas stations are and sure
we could find fast food chains but where
would be the nearest AED to help this
patient we asked around and nobody knew
nobody knew where the nearest
life-saving ad was to obtain right now
so what we did we crowd-sourced the
Netherlands we set up a website and
asked the crowd if you see an ad please
submit it tell us where it is tell us
when it&#39;s open since sometimes in office
hours it&#39;s close of course and over
10,000 80s and the nettles already have
been submitted the next step we took was
find application for it and we build an
ipad application we made an application
for layer of automated reality to find
these IEDs and whenever you were in the
city like Maastricht and somebody
collapse you can use your iPhone and
within the next week&#39;s also on your
Microsoft cell phone to find the nearest
AED which can save lives and as of today
we would like to introduce this not only
as a ed for you which is the product
called but also ad for us and we would
like to start this on a worldwide level
and asking all colleagues of us in the
rest of the world colleague universities
to help us to find and work and act like
a hop to crowdsource all these 80s
around the world that whenever you are
on the holiday and somebody collapses
might admit your own relative or someone
just in front of you you can find this
the other thing we&#39;d like to ask is
companies also all of the world that
will be able to help us validate these
IEDs this might be courier services or
cable guys for instance just to see
whether the ad that submitted still is
in place so please help us on this one
and try to make not only help a little
bit better but taken to all of it thank
you
