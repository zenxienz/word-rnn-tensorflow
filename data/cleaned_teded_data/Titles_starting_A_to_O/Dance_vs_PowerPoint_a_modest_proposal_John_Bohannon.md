good afternoon as her all aware we face
difficult economic times I come to you
with a modest proposal for easing the
financial burden this idea came to me
while talking to a physicists friend of
mine at MIT he was struggling to explain
something to me
a beautiful experiment that uses lasers
to cool down matter now he confused me
from the very start because light
doesn&#39;t cool things down it makes it
hotter it&#39;s happening right now the
reason that you can see me standing here
is because this room is filled with more
than 100 quintillion photons and they&#39;re
moving randomly through the space near
the speed of light all of them are
different colors they&#39;re rippling with
different frequencies and they&#39;re
bouncing off every surface including me
and some of those are flying directly
into your eyes and that&#39;s why your brain
is forming an image of me standing here
now a laser is different it also uses
photons but they&#39;re all synchronized and
if you focus them into a beam what you
have is an incredible useful tool the
control of a laser is so precise that
you can perform surgery inside of an eye
you can use it to store massive amounts
of data and you can use it for this
beautiful experiment that my friend was
struggling to explain first you trap
atoms in a special bottle it uses
electromagnetic fields to isolate the
atoms from the noise of the environment
and the atoms themselves are quite
violent but if you fire lasers that are
precisely tuned to the right frequency
an atom will briefly absorb those
photons and tend to slow down little by
little it gets colder until eventually
it approaches absolute zero now if you
use the right kind of atoms and you get
them cold enough something truly bizarre
happens it&#39;s no longer a solid a liquid
or gas it enters a new state of matter
called a superfluid the atoms lose their
individual identity and the rules from
the quantum world take over and that&#39;s
what gives superfluid such spooky
properties for example if you shine
light through superfluid
it is able to slow photons down to 60
kilometers per hour
another spooky property is that it flows
with absolutely no viscosity or friction
so if you were to take the lid off that
bottle
it won&#39;t stay inside a thin film will
creep up the inside wall flow over the
top and right out the outside now of
course the moment that it does hit the
outside environment and its temperature
rises by even a fraction of a degree it
immediately turns back into normal
matter super fluids are one of the most
fragile things we&#39;ve ever discovered and
this is the great pleasure of science
the defeat of our intuition through
experimentation but the experiment is
not the end of the story because you
still have to transmit that knowledge to
other people I have a PhD in molecular
biology I still barely understand what
most scientists are talking about
so as my friend was trying to explain
that experiment it seemed like the more
he said the less I understood because if
you&#39;re trying to give someone the big
picture of a complex idea to really
capture its essence the fewer words you
use the better
in fact the ideal may be to use no words
at all I remember thinking my friend
could have explained that entire
experiment with a dance of course there
never seems to be any dancers around
when you need them now the idea is not
as crazy as it sounds I started a
contest four years ago called dance your
PhD instead of explaining their research
with words scientists have to explain it
with dance now surprisingly it seems to
work dance really can make science
easier to understand but don&#39;t take my
word for it go on the internet and
search for dance your PhD there are
hundreds of dancing scientists waiting
for you the most surprising thing that
I&#39;ve learned while running this contest
is that some scientists are now working
directly with dancers on their research
for example at the University of
Minnesota there&#39;s a biomedical engineer
named David Odie and he works with
dancers to study how cells move they do
it by changing their shape when a
chemical signal washes up on one side it
triggers the cell to expand its shape on
that side because the cell is constantly
touching and tugging at the environment
so that allows cells to
whose along in the right directions but
what seems so slow and graceful from the
outside is really more like chaos inside
because cells control their shape with a
skeleton of rigid protein fibers and
those fibers are constantly falling
apart but just as quickly as they
explode more proteins attach to the end
and grow them longer so it&#39;s constantly
changing just to remain exactly the same
now david builds mathematical models of
this and then he touched those in the
lab but before he does that he works
with dancers to figure out what kinds of
models to build in the first place it&#39;s
basically efficient brainstorming and
when I visited David to learn about his
research he used dancers to explain it
to me rather than the usual method
PowerPoint and this brings me to my
modest proposal I think that bad
PowerPoint presentations are a serious
threat to the global economy
now
it does depend on how you measure it of
course but one estimate has put the
drain at 250 million dollars per day now
that assumes half our presentations for
an average audience of four people with
salaries of $35,000 and it
conservatively assumes that about a
quarter of the presentations are a
complete waste of time and even that
there are some apparently 30 million
PowerPoint presentations created every
day that would indeed add up to an
annual waste of a hundred billion
dollars of course that&#39;s just the time
we&#39;re losing sitting through
presentations there are other costs
because PowerPoint is a tool and like
any tool it can and will be abused to
borrow a concept from my country&#39;s CIA
it helps you to soften up your audience
it distracts them with pretty pictures
irrelevant data it allows you to create
the illusion of competence the illusion
of simplicity and most destructively the
illusion of understanding so now my
country is 15 trillion dollars in debt
our leaders are working tirelessly to
try and find ways to save money one idea
is to drastically reduce public support
for the Arts for example our National
Endowment for the Arts with its 150
million dollar budget slashing that
program would immediately reduce the
national debt by about one one
thousandth of a percent one certainly
can&#39;t argue with those numbers however
once we eliminate public funding for the
Arts there will be some drawbacks the
artists on the street will swell the
ranks of the unemployed many will turn
to drug abuse and prostitution and that
will inevitably lower property values in
urban neighborhoods all of this could
wipe out the savings were hope to make
hoping to make in the first place I
shall now therefore humbly propose my
own thoughts which I hope will not be
liable to the least objection once we
eliminate public funding for the artists
let&#39;s put them back to work by using
them instead of PowerPoint
as a test case I propose we start with
American dancers after all they are the
most perishable of their kind prone to
injury and very slow to heal due to our
health care system rather than dancing
our PhDs we should use dance to explain
all of our complex problems imagine our
politicians using dance to explain why
we must invade a foreign country or bail
out an investment bank it&#39;s sure to help
of course someday in the deep future a
technology of persuasion even more
powerful than PowerPoint may be invented
rendering dancers unnecessary as tools
of rhetoric however I trust that by that
day we shall it past this present
financial calamity perhaps by then we
will be able to afford the luxury of
just sitting in an audience with no
other purpose than to witness the human
form in motion
