[What skills do you think
are most important
for people to have for jobs
available 10 years from now?]
I think social skills include flexibility
and the ability to work
with a diverse group of people.
I think that&#39;s very important.
And I think communication skills --
learning to clearly communicate
where you are in your progress,
what your roadblocks are,
and understanding that that&#39;s okay.
&quot;I&#39;m having an issue, I need this help.&quot;
People need better communication skills,
because I think teams are more agile,
and when people come together,
you just have to learn to communicate.
I think communication
is a very important skill.
I think computer skills
are going to be something
people expect you to have.
Imagine going to work and you&#39;re like,
&quot;Gee, you know, I can&#39;t type.
I can&#39;t use a keyboard.&quot;
Well, of course
you have to use a keyboard!
So, the ability to learn
computer languages,
to have some basic programming skills.
Even the designers in our group,
they program in Arduino.
The social scientists are programming
these visualization packages.
I think computer literacy,
programming literacy,
is going to be extremely important.
