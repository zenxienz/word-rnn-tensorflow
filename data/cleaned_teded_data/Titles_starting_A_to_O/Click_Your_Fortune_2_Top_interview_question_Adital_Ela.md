What&#39;s one interview question you ask every prospective employee?
I did employ quite a lot of people in my life
in various positions.
And at the moment,
at this point in time
that I have my own business
and I&#39;m looking for people to collaborate,

is what are their deepest motivations
because if their deepest motivations

all the toolbox in the world
cannot replace the right motivation,
and this is actually what I&#39;m looking for.
