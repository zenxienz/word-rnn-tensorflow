let&#39;s just start by looking at some
great photographs this is an icon of
National Geographic an Afghan refugee
taken by Steve McCurry but the Harvard
Lampoon is about to come out with a
parody of National Geographic and I
shudder to think what they are going to
do to this photograph oh the wrath of
Photoshop this is a jet landing at San
Francisco by Bruce Dale oh he mounted
the camera on the tail poetic image for
a story on Tolstoy by Sam Abel pygmies
in the DRC by Randy Olson I love this
photograph because it reminds me of
Degas bronze sculptures the little
dancer a polar bear swimming in the
Arctic by Paul Nicklin polar bears need
ice to be able to move back and forth
they&#39;re not very good swimmers and we
know what&#39;s happening into the ice
these are camels moving across the Rift
Valley in Africa photographed by Chris
John&#39;s shot straight down so these are
the shadows of the camels this is a
rancher in Texas by William Albert
Allard a great portraitist
and Jane Goodall making her own special
connection photographed by Nick Nichols
this is a soap disco in Spain
photographed by David Alan Harvey and
David said that there was a lot of weird
stuff happening on the dance floor but
hey it&#39;s at least it&#39;s hygienic
these are sea lions in Australia doing
their own dance by David Doubilet and
this is a comet captured by dr. Ewen
Mason and finally the bow of the Titanic
without movie stars photographed by
Emory Kristof photography carries a
power that holds up under the relentless
swirl today&#39;s saturated media world
because photographs emulate the way that
our mind freezes a significant moment
here&#39;s an example four years ago I was
at the beach with my son and he was
learning how to swim in this relatively
soft surf of the Delaware Beaches
but I turned away for a moment and he
got caught into a Riptide and started to
be pulled out towards a jetty I went I
can stand here right now and see as I go
tearing into the water after him the
moment slowing down and freezing into
this arrangement I can see the rocks are
over here there&#39;s a wave about to crash
onto him I can see his hands reaching
out and I can see his face in terror
looking at me saying help me dad I got
him the wave break OH broke over us we
got back on shore he was fine we were a
little bit rattled but this flashbulb
memory as it&#39;s called is when all the
elements came together to define not
just the event but my emotional
connection to it and this is what a
photograph taps into when it makes its
own powerful connection to a viewer now
I have to tell you I was talking to Kyle
last week about this that I was going to
tell this story he said oh yeah I
remember that too I remember my image of
you was that you were up on the shore
yelling at me
I thought I was a hero so this
represents this is a cross sample of
some remarkable images taken by some of
the world&#39;s greatest photo journalists
working at the very top of their craft
except one this photograph was taken by
dr. Ewen Mason in New Zealand last year
and it was submitted and published in
National Geographic last year we added a
section to our website called your shot
where anyone can submit photographs for
possible publication and it has become a
wild success tapping into the enthusiast
photography community the quality of
these amateur photographs can at times
be amazing and seeing this reinforces
for me that every one of us has at least
one or two great photographs in them but
to be a great photojournalist you have
to have more than just one or two great
photographs in you you&#39;ve got to be able
to make them all the time but even more
importantly you need to know how to
create a visual narrative you need to
know how to tell a story so I&#39;m going to
share with you some coverages that I
feel demonstrate the storytelling power
of photography photographer Nick Nichols
went to document a very small and
relatively unknown Wildlife Sanctuary in
Chad called zoo coma the original intent
was to travel there and bring back a
classic story of diverse species of an
exotic locale and that is what Nick did
up to a point this is a serval cat he&#39;s
actually taking his own picture shot
with what&#39;s called a camera trap there&#39;s
an infrared beam that&#39;s going across and
he stepped into the beam and taken his
photograph
these are baboons at a watering hole
Nick or the camera again an automatic
camera took thousands of pictures of
this and Nick ended up with a lot of
pictures of the rear ends of
a lion having a late night snack notice
he&#39;s got a broken tooth and a crocodile
walks up a riverbank towards its den I
love this little bit of water that comes
off the back of his tail but the
centerpiece species of zoo coma are the
elephants it&#39;s one of the largest intact
herds in this part of Africa here&#39;s a
photograph shot in moonlight something
that digital photography has made a big
difference for it was with the elephants
this story pivoted Nick along with
researcher dr. Michael Fay collared the
matriarch of the herd they named her
Annie and they began tracking her
movements the herd was safe within the
confines of the park because of this
dedicated group of Park Rangers
but once the annual rains began the herd
would begin migrating to feeding grounds
outside the park and that&#39;s when they
ran into trouble for outside the safety
of the park were poachers who would hunt
them down only for the value of their
ivory tusks the matriarch that they were
radio tracking after weeks of moving
back and forth in and out of the park
came to a halt outside the park Annie
had been killed along with 20 members of
her herd and they only came for the
ivory
and this is actually one of the Rangers
they were able to chase off one of the
poachers and recover this I read because
they couldn&#39;t leave it there it was
still valuable but what Nick did was he
brought back with it was a story that
went beyond the old-school method of
just straight isn&#39;t this an amazing
world and instead created a story that
touched our audiences deeply instead of
just knowledge of this park he created
an understanding and an empathy for the
elephants the Rangers and the many
issues surrounding human wildlife
conflict now let&#39;s go over to India
sometimes you can tell a broad story in
a focused way we were looking at the
same issue that Richard Wurman touches
upon in his new world population project
for the first time in history more
people live in urban rather than rural
environs and most of that growth is not
in the cities but in the slums that
surround them
Jonas bendixson a very energetic
photographer came to me and said we need
to document this and here&#39;s my here&#39;s my
proposal let&#39;s go all over the world and
photograph every single slum around the
world I said well you know that might be
a bit ambitious for our budget so
instead what we did was we decided to
instead of going out and doing what
would result in what we consider sort of
a survey story where you just go in and
see just a little bit of everything we
put Jonas into Dharavi which is part of
Mumbai India and let him stay there and
really get into the heart and soul of
this really you know major part of the
city what Jonas did was not just go and
do a surface look at the awful
conditions that exists in such places he
saw that this was a living and breathing
and vital part of how the entire urban
area functioned by staying tightly
focused in one place
Jonah&#39;s tapped in to the soul and the
enduring human spirit that underlies
this community and he did it in a
beautiful way sometimes though the only
way to tell a story is with the sweeping
picture we teamed up underwater
photographer Brian scary and
photojournalist Randy Olson to document
the depletion of the world&#39;s fisheries
we weren&#39;t the only ones to tackle this
subject but the photographs that Bryan
and Randy created are
the best to capture both the human and
natural devastation of overfishing here
in a photo by Brian a seemingly
crucified shark is caught up in a gill
net off of baja I&#39;ve seen sort of okay
pictures of by catch the animals
accidentally scooped up while fishing
for a specific species but here Brian
captured a unique view by positioning
himself underneath the boat when they
threw the waste overboard and Brian then
went on to even greater risk to get this
never before made photograph of a trawl
net scraping the ocean bottom back on
land Randy Olson photographed a
makeshift fish market in Africa where
the remains of filleted fish were sold
to the locals the main parts having
already been sent to Europe and here in
China
Randy shot a jellyfish market as prime
food sources are depleted the harvest
goes deeper into the oceans and brings
in more such sources of protein this is
called fishing down the food chain but
there are also glimmers of hope and I
think anytime we&#39;re doing a big big
story on this we&#39;re not only going we&#39;re
not we don&#39;t really want to go and just
look at all the problems we also want to
look for solutions and Brian
photographed a marine sanctuary in New
Zealand where commercial fishing had
been banned the result being that the
overfished species have been restored
and with them a possible solution for
sustainable fisheries photography can
also compel us to confront issues that
are potentially distressing and
controversial James Nachtwey who was
honored last year at last year&#39;s Ted
took a look at the sweep of the medical
system that is utilized to handle the
American wounded coming out of Iraq it
is like a tube where a wounded soldier
enters on one end and exits back home on
the other Jim started in the battlefield
here a medical technician tends to a
wounded soldier on the helicopter ride
back to the field hospital here is in
the field hospital the soldier on the
right has the name of his daughter
tattooed across his chest as a reminder
of home from here the more severely
wounded or transported back to Germany
where they meet up with their families
for the first time
and then back to the states to
recuperate at Veterans Hospitals such as
here in Walter Reed and finally often
fitted with high-tech prothesis they
exit the medical system and attempt to
regain their pre-war lives Jim took what
could have been a straight-up medical
science story and gave it a human
dimension that touched our readers
deeply now these stories are great
examples of how photography can be used
to address some of our most important
topics but there are also times when
photographers simply encounter things
that are when it comes down to it just
plain fun photographer Paul Nicklin
traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story
on leopard seals they have been rarely
photographed partly because they are
considered one of the most dangerous
predators in the ocean in fact a year
earlier a researcher had been grabbed by
one and pulled down to depth and killed
so you could imagine
Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant
about getting into the water now what
leopard seals do mostly is they eat
penguins
you know the march of the Penguins this
is sort of a munch of the Penguins here
a penguin goes up to the edge and looks
out to see if the coast is clear and
then everybody kind of runs out and goes
out but then Paul got in the water and
he said he was never really afraid of
this uh well this this one female came
up to him
she&#39;s probably it&#39;s a shame you can&#39;t
see it in the photograph but she&#39;s 12
feet long so she is pretty significant
in size and Paul said he was never
really afraid because she was more
curious about him than threatened this
mouthing behavior on the right was
really her way of saying to him hey look
how look how big I am or you know my
what big teeth you have
then Paul thinks that she simply took
pity on him to her here was this big
goofy creature in the water that for
some reason didn&#39;t seem to be interested
in chasing penguins so what she did was
she started to bring penguins to him
alive and put them in front of him she
dropped them off and then they would
swim away she&#39;s going to look at him but
what are you doing go back and get them
and then bring them back and drop them
in front of him
and she did this for over the course of
a couple of days until the point where
she got so frustrated with him that she
started putting them directly on top of
his head
it&#39;s just resulted in a fantastic
photograph eventually the hall thinks
that she just figured that he was never
going to survive this is her kind of
just puffing out uh you know snorting
out and sort of discussed and lost
interest with him and went back to what
she does best Paul set out to photograph
a relatively mysterious and unknown
creature and came back with not just a
collection of photographs but an amazing
experience and a great story it is these
kinds of stories ones that go beyond the
immediate or just the superficial that
demonstrate the power of photojournalism
I believe that photography can make a
real connection to people and can be
employed as a positive agent for
understanding the challenges and
opportunities facing our world today
thank you
