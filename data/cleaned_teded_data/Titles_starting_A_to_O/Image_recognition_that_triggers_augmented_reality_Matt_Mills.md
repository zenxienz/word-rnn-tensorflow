so wouldn&#39;t it be amazing if our phones
could see the world in the same way that
we do as we&#39;re walking around being able
to to point the phone at anything and
then haven&#39;t actually recognized images
and objects like the human brain and
then be able to pull in information from
an almost infinite library of knowledge
and experiences and ideas well
traditionally that was seen as science
fiction but now we&#39;ve moved to a world
where actually this has become possible
so the best way of explaining it is to
just show it what you can see over here
is tomorrow who&#39;s holding my phone
that&#39;s now plugged in so let me start
with this what we have here is a
painting of the great poet Robbie Burns
and it&#39;s just a normal image but if we
now switch inputs over to the phone
running our technology you can see
effectively what tamiya seeing on the
screen and when she points at this image
something magical happens
I
no matter blinks and now what&#39;s great
about this is there&#39;s no trickery here
there&#39;s no there&#39;s nothing done to this
image and what&#39;s great about this is the
technologies that she allowing the phone
to start to see and understand much like
other human brain does not only that but
as I move the object around the book
it&#39;s going to track it and overlay that
content seamlessly again the thing
that&#39;s incredible about this is this is
how advanced these devices have become
all the processing to do that was
actually done on the device itself now
this is applications everywhere whether
in things like art museums like you just
saw or in the world of say advertising
or print journalism so a newspaper
becomes out of date as soon as it&#39;s
printed here is this morning&#39;s newspaper
and we have some Wimbledon news which is
great now what we can do is point at the
front of the newspaper and immediately
get the bulletin ring
you adapt and you you have to be
flexible you have to be willing to
change direction at a split-second and
she does all that she&#39;s won this title
and that linking of the the digital
content is something that&#39;s physical is
what we call an aura and I&#39;ll be using
that term Anila as we go through the
talk so what&#39;s great about this is it
isn&#39;t just a faster more convenient way
to get information in the real world but
there are times when actually using this
medium allows you to be able to display
information in a way that was never
before possible so what I have here is a
wireless fruta and my American
colleagues have told me I&#39;ve got to call
it a router so that everyone here
understands but nonetheless here is the
device so now what I can do is rather
than getting the instructions for the
device online I can simply pointed it
the device is recognized and then begin
by plugging in the grate it yourself
cable then connect the power finally the
yellow Ethernet cable congratulations
you have now completed setup awesome
thank you
the incredible work that made that
possible was done here in the UK by by
scientists at Cambridge and they work in
our offices and I&#39;ve got a lovely
picture of them here they couldn&#39;t all
be on stage but we&#39;re going to bring
that over to the stage so here they are
they&#39;re not very animated so this was
the fourth take I&#39;m told ok so as we&#39;re
talking about Cambridge let&#39;s now move
on to technical advancements because
since we started putting this technology
on mobile phones are less than less than
12 months ago the speed and the
processor in these devices has grown at
a really phenomenal rate and that means
that I can now take cinema quality 3d
models and place them in the world
around me so I have one over here
tomorrow would you like to jump in
as sleepin
so then after the fun comes the more
emotional side of what we do because
effectively this technology allows you
to see the world through someone&#39;s eyes
and for that person to be able to take a
moment in time and effectively store it
and tag it to something physical that
exists in the real world what&#39;s great
about this is the tools to do this are
free they&#39;re open and they&#39;re available
to everyone within our application and
educators have really got on board with
with the classrooms so we have teachers
who&#39;ve tagged up textbooks teachers
who&#39;ve tagged up school classrooms and a
great example of this is a school in the
UK I have a picture here from a video
and we&#39;re now going to play it
now move the other side see what happens
move away from it and come back to it
have you got it again so it&#39;s not magic
it&#39;s available for everyone to do and
actually I&#39;m going to show you how easy
it is to do by doing one right now so I
sort of I&#39;m told it&#39;s called a stadium
wave so we&#39;re gonna start from this side
of the room on the count of three and go
over to here tomorrow are you recording
okay so you all ready one two three go
fellows are really good now okay now
we&#39;re going to switch back into the
Aurasma plication and what tomorrow&#39;s
gonna do is is tag that video that we
just took onto my my badge so that I can
remember it forever now we have lots of
people who are doing this already and
we&#39;ve talked a little about the
educational side on the emotional side
we have people who&#39;ve done things like
sent postcards and Christmas cards back
to their family with with little
messages on we have people who have for
example taken the inside of the engine
bay of an old car and tagged up
different components within an engine so
that if you&#39;re stuck and you want to
find out more you can point and discover
the information we&#39;re all very very
familiar with the Internet in the last
20 years it&#39;s really changed the way
that we live and work and the way that
we see the world and what&#39;s great is we
sort of think this is the next paradigm
shift because now we can literally take
the content that we share we discover
and that we enjoy and make it a part of
the world around us it&#39;s completely free
to download this application if you have
a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G this
process is very very quick I&#39;ll play up
we can save it now it&#39;s just going to do
a tiny bit of processing to convert that
image that we just took into a sort of
digital fingerprint and the great thing
is if you&#39;re a professional user so in
newspaper the tools are pretty much
identical to what we&#39;ve just used to
create this
administration the only difference is
that you&#39;ve got the ability to add in
links and slightly more content you&#39;re
now ready okay so I&#39;m Toby ready which
means we can now point at the image and
there you all are
well done creeping around my thankee
