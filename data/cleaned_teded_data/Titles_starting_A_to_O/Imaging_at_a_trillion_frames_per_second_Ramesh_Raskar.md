doc Edgerton inspired us with our and
curiosity with this photo of a bullet
piercing through an apple an exposure
just a millionth of a second but now 50
years later we can go a million times
faster and see the world not at a
million or a billion but one trillion
frames per second I present you a new
type of photography femto photography a
new imaging technique so fast that you
can create slow motion videos of light
in motion and with that we can create
cameras that can look around corners
beyond line-of-sight or see inside our
body without an x-ray and really
challenge what we mean by a camera now
if I take a laser pointer and turn it on
and off in one trillionth of a second
which is several femtoseconds i&#39;ll
create a packet of photons barely a
millimeter wide and that packet of
photons that bullet will travel at a
speed of light and again a million times
faster than an ordinary bullet now if
you take that bullet and take this
packet of photons and fire into this
bottle how will those photons shatter
into this bottle how does light look in
slow motion
now the whole event now remember the
whole event is effectively taking place
in less than a nanosecond that&#39;s how
much time it takes for light to travel
but i&#39;m slowing down in this video by a
factor of 10 billion so you can see the
light in motion but coca-cola did not
sponsor this research now there&#39;s a lot
going on in this movie so let me break
this down and show you what&#39;s going on
so the pulse enters the bottle our
bullet with a packet of photon they
start traveling through and they start
scattering inside some of the light
leaks goes on the table and you start
seeing this ripples of Wales many of the
photons eventually reach the cap and
then they explode in various directions
as you can see there is a bubble of air
and bouncing around inside meanwhile the
repulse are traveling on the table and
because of the reflections at the top
you&#39;ll see at the back of the bottle
after several frames reflections are
focused now if you take an ordinary
bullet and let it go the same distance
and slow down the video again by a
factor of 10 billion do you know how
long you&#39;ll have to sit here to watch
that movie a day a week actually holier
it&#39;ll be a very boring movie of a slow
ordinary bullet in motion and what about
some still life photography
you can watch the ripples again washing
over the table the tomato and the wall
in the back it&#39;s like throwing a stone
in a pond of water why this is how
nature paints a photo one femto frame at
a time but of course our eye sees an
integral composite but if you look at
this tomato one more time you will
notice as the light washes over the
tomato it continues to glow it doesn&#39;t
become dark why is that because the
tomato is actually right and the light
is bouncing around inside the tomato and
it comes out after several trillionths
of a second so in the future when this
femto camera is in your camera phone you
might be able to go to a supermarket and
check if the fruit is ripe without
actually touching it so how did my team
at MIT create this camera now as
photographers you know if you take a
short exposure photo you get very little
light but we&#39;re going to go a billion
times faster than your shortest exposure
so you can&#39;t get hardly any light so
what we do is we send that bullet those
packet of photons millions of times and
record again and again which very clever
synchronization and from the gigabytes
of data we computationally view together
to create those femto videos I show you
and we can take all that raw data and
treat it in very interesting ways so
Superman can fly some other heroes can
become invisible but what about a new
power for a future superhero to see
around corners the idea is that we&#39;re
going to shine some light on the door
it&#39;s going to bounce go inside the room
some of that are going to reflect back
on the door and then back to the camera
and we could exploit this multiple
bounces of light and it&#39;s not science
fiction we have actually built it on the
left you see our femto camera there&#39;s a
mannequin hidden behind a wall and we&#39;re
going to bounce light off the door so
after our paper was published in Nature
communication
it was highlighted by Nature calm and
they created this animation we&#39;re going
to fire those bullets of light and
they&#39;re going to hit this wall and
because the packet of the photons they
will scatter in all the directions and
some of them will reach our hidden
mannequin which in turn will against
cattle that light and again in turn the
door will reflect some of that scattered
light and a tiny fraction of the photons
will actually come back to the camera
but most interestingly they will all
arrive at a slightly different time slot
and because we have a camera that can
run so fast our femto camera it has some
unique abilities it has a very good time
resolution and it can look at the world
at speed of light and this way we know
the distances of course to the door but
also to the hidden objects but we don&#39;t
know which point corresponds to which
distance by shining one laser we can
record one raw photo which you look on
the screen doesn&#39;t really make any sense
but the remember take a lot of such
pictures dozens of such pictures put
them together and try to analyze the
multiple bounces of light and from that
can we see the hidden object can be see
it in full 3d so this is our
reconstruction
now we have some ways to go before we
take this outside the lab on the road
but in the future we could create cars
that avoid collision with what&#39;s around
the bend or we can look for survivors in
hazardous conditions by looking at light
reflected through open windows or we can
build endoscopes that can see deep
inside the body around uploaders and
also for cardio scopes but of course
because of tissue and blood this is
quite challenging so this is really a
call for scientist to start thinking
about femto photography as we a new
imaging modality to solve next
generation of health imaging problems
now like Doc Edgerton a scientist
himself science became art an art of
ultra-fast photography and I realized
that this all the gigabytes of data that
were collecting every time is not just
for scientific imaging but we can also
do a new form of computational
photography with time lapse and color
coding and we look at those ripples
remember the time between each of those
ripples is only a few trillionth of a
second but is also something funny going
on here when you look at the rippers
under the cap the ripples are moving
away from us the rapport should be
moving towards us what&#39;s going on here
it turns out because we&#39;re recording
nearly at the speed of light we have
strange effects and Einstein would have
loved to see this picture the order at
which events take place in the world
appear in the camera with sometimes
reversed order so by applying the
corresponding space and time warp we can
correct for this distortion so whether
it&#39;s for photography around corners or
creating the next generation of health
imaging or creating new visualizations
since our invention we have open sourced
all the data and details
on our website and our hope is that the
DIY the creative and the research
community will show us that we should
stop obsessing about the megapixels in
cameras and start focusing on the next
dimension in imaging it&#39;s about time
thank
you
