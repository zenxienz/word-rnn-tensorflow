What&#39;s one interview question you ask every prospective employee?
So, I often ask questions
for people to describe an experience they&#39;ve had before.
But when I&#39;m interviewing,
I&#39;m also recruiting.
So, if you&#39;re interviewing for a job,
realize that the person interviewing you
is also at the same time trying to
show how great their job is.
And so there are cues where you can acknowledge that
or show that you&#39;re listening,
show that you appreciate that.
So, in addition to trying to just answer questions,
I think picking up on that dynamic
can give someone a competitive advantage in an interview.
