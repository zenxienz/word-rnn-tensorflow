Well, I think that when I was in grade school,
I was still very much loyal to the way of thinking
that I heard around me,
so I couldn&#39;t imagine much further
than being either a lawyer or a psychologist.
And it&#39;s only a few years later
that I found enough freedom in myself
to really ask what drives me
and what I would like to do with my life.
And maybe only ten years later or more,
my path really started revealing itself
and these are the moments when I was brave enough
to really listen to what I want to do
with every waking moment.
