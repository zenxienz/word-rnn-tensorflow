today I want to talk about design but
not design is we usually think about it
I want to talk about what is happening
now in our scientific biotechnological
culture where for really the first time
in history we have the power to design
bodies to design animal bodies to design
human bodies in the history of our
planet there have been three great waves
of evolution the first wave of evolution
is what we think of as Darwinian
evolution so as you all know species
lived in particular ecological niches in
particular environments and the
pressures of those environments selected
which changes through random mutations
in species were going to be preserved
then human beings stepped out of the
Darwinian flow of evolutionary history
and created the second great wave of
evolution which was we changed the
environment in which we evolved we
altered our ecological niche by creating
civilization and that has been the
second great couple hundred thousand
years one hundred and fifty thousand
year flow of our evolution by changing
our environment we put new pressures on
our bodies to evolve whether it was
through settling down in agricultural
communities all the way through modern
medicine we have changed our own
evolution now we&#39;re entering a third
Great Wave of evolutionary history which
has been called many things intentional
evolution evolution by design very
different than intelligent design
whereby we are actually now
intentionally designing and altering the
physiological forms that inhabit our
planet so I want to take you through a
kind of whirlwind tour of that and then
at the end talk a little bit about what
some of the implications are for us and
for our species as well as our cultures
because of this change now we actually
have been doing it for a long time
we started selectively breeding animals
many many thousands of years ago and if
you think of dogs for example dogs are
now intentionally designed creatures
there isn&#39;t a dog on this earth that&#39;s a
natural creature dogs are the result of
selectively breeding traits that we like
but we had to do it the hard way in the
old days by choosing offspring that
looked a particular way and then
breeding them we don&#39;t have to do it
that way anymore this is a Beefalo a
Beefalo is a buffalo cattle hybrid and
they are now making them and someday
perhaps pretty soon you will have
Beefalo patties in your local
supermarket this is a GEEP a goat sheep
hybrid the scientists that made this
cute little creature ended up
slaughtering it and eating it afterwards
I think they said it tastes like chicken
this is a comma a comma is a camel llama
hybrid created to try to get the
hardiness of a camel with some of the
personality traits of a llama and they
are now using these in certain cultures
then there&#39;s the liger this is the
largest cat in the world the lion tiger
hybrid it&#39;s bigger than a tiger and in
the case of the liger there actually
have been one or two that had been seen
in the wild but these were created by
scientists using both selective breeding
and genetic technology and then finally
everybody&#39;s favorite the source none of
this is photoshopped these are real
creatures and so one of the things we
have been doing is using genetic
enhancement or genetic manipulation of
sort of normal selective breeding pushed
a little bit through genetics and if
that were all this was about then it
would be an interesting thing but
something much much more powerful is
happening now these are normal mammalian
cells genetically engineered with a
bioluminescence
Jeane taken out of deep-sea jellyfish we
all know that some deep-sea creatures
glow
well they&#39;ve now taken that gene that
bioluminescent gene and put it into
mammal cells these are normal cells and
what you see here is these cells glowing
in the dark under certain wavelengths of
light
once they could do that with cells they
could do it with organisms so they did
it with Mouse pups kittens and by the
way the reason the kittens here are
orange and these are green is because
that&#39;s a bioluminescent gene from coral
while this is from jellyfish they did it
with pigs they did it with puppies and
in fact they did it with monkeys and if
you can do it with monkeys though the
great leap in trying to genetically
manipulate is actually between monkeys
and apes if they can do it in monkeys
they can probably figure out how to do
it in Apes which means they can do it in
human beings in other words it is
theoretically possible that before too
long we will be bio technologically
capable of creating human beings that
glow in the dark be easier to find us at
night and in fact right now in many
states you can go out and you can buy
bioluminescent pets
these are zebrafish they&#39;re normally
black and silver these are sea brofist
that have been genetically engineered to
be yellow green red and they are
actually available now in certain states
other states have banned them nobody
knows what to do with these kinds of
creatures there is no area of the
government not the EPA or the FDA that
controls genetically engineered pets and
so some states have decided to allow
them some states have decided to ban
them some of you may have read about the
FDA&#39;s consideration right now of
genetically engineered salmon the salmon
on top is a genetically engineered
chinook salmon using a gene from the
salmon and from one other fish that we
eat to make it grow much faster using a
lot less
need and right now the FDA is trying to
make a final decision on whether pretty
soon you could be eating this fish it&#39;ll
be sold in the stores and before you get
too worried about it here in the United
States the majority of food you buy in
the supermarket already has genetically
modified components to it
so even as we worry about it we have
allowed it to go on in this country much
different in Europe without any
regulation and even without any
identification on the package these are
all the first cloned animals of their
type so in the lower right here you have
dolly the first cloned sheep now happily
stuffed in a museum in Edinboro Ralph
the rat the first cloned rat Cece the
cat four cloned cat Snuppy the first
cloned dog Snuppy for Seoul National
University puppy created in South Korea
by the very same man that some of you
may remember how to end up resigning in
disgrace because he claimed he had
cloned a human embryo which he had not
he actually was the first person to
clone a dog which is a very difficult
thing to do because dog genomes are very
plastic this is pro media the first
cloned horse it&#39;s a halfling or horse
cloned in Italy a real gold ring of
cloning because there are many horses
that win important races who are
geldings in other words the equipment to
put them out to stud has been removed
but if you can clone that horse you can
have both the advantage of having a
gelding run in the race and is identical
genetic duplicate can then be put out to
stud these were the first cloned calves
the first cloned gray wolves and then
finally the first cloned piglets Alexa
Chrissie Carol Janie and dot-com in
addition we&#39;ve started to use cloning
technology to try to save endangered
species this is the use of animals now
to create drugs and other things in
their bodies that we want to create so
with antithrombin in that goat that goat
has been genetically modified so that
the molecule
fools of its milk actually include the
molecule of antithrombin that GTC
genetics wants to create and then in
addition transgenic pigs knockout pigs
from the National Institute of Animal
Science in South Korea are pigs that
they are going to use in fact to try to
create all kinds of drugs and other
industrial types of chemicals that they
want the blood and the milk of these
animals to produce for them instead of
producing them in an industrial way
these are two creatures that were
created in order to save endangered
species the guar is an endangered
Southeast Asian ungulate it was a
somatic cell a body cell was taken from
its body just stated in the ovum of a
cow and then that cow gave birth to a
guar same thing happened with the mullen
where it&#39;s an endangered species of
sheep it&#39;s it was just hated in a
regular sheep body which actually raises
an interesting biological problem we
have two kinds of DNA in our bodies we
have our nucleic DNA that everybody
thinks of as our DNA but we also have
DNA in our mitochondria which are the
energy packets of the cell that DNA is
passed down through our mothers so
really what you end up having here is
not a guar and not a muffin but a guar
with cow mitochondria and therefore cow
mitochondrial DNA and a Moo Flynn with
another species of sheep&#39;s mitochondrial
DNA these are really hybrids not pure
animals and it raises the question of
how we&#39;re going to define animal species
in the age of biotechnology a question
that we&#39;re not really sure yet how to
solve this lovely creature is an Asian
cockroach and what they&#39;ve done here is
they&#39;ve put electrodes in its ganglia
and its brain and then a transmitter on
top and it&#39;s on a big computer tracking
ball and now using a joystick they
can send this creature around the lab
and control whether it goes left to
right forward or backwards they&#39;ve
created a kind of insect bot or bug body
it gets worse than that or perhaps
better than that this actually is one of
DARPA is very important DARPA is the
defense research agency one of their
projects these Goliath beetles are wired
in their wings they have a computer chip
strapped to their backs and they can fly
these creatures around the lab they can
make them go left right I can make them
take off they can actually make them
land they put them about one inch above
the ground and then they shut everything
off when they go but it&#39;s a close as
they can get to a landing and in fact
this technology has gotten so developed
that this creature this is a moth this
is the moth in in its poopa stage and
that&#39;s when they put the wires in and
they put the computer technology so that
when the moth is actually emerges as a
moth it is already pre-wired the wires
are already in its body and they can
just hook it up to their technology and
now they&#39;ve got these bug BOTS that they
can send out for surveillance they can
put little cameras on them and perhaps
some day delivering other kinds of
ordnance to war zones it&#39;s not just
insects this is the rat pot or the Robo
rat by Sanjeev Talwar it SUNY Downstate
again it&#39;s got technology it&#39;s got
electrodes going into its left and right
hemispheres it&#39;s got a camera on top of
its head
the scientists can make this creature go
left right they have it running through
mazes controlling where it&#39;s going they
now created an organic robot the
graduate students and Sanji&#39;s kawaras
lab said is this ethical we taken away
the autonomy of this animal and get back
to that in a minute there&#39;s also been
work done with monkeys this is Miguel
Nicolelis of Duke he took all monkeys
wired them up so that a computer watched
their brains while they moved especially
looking at the move
the right arm the computer learned what
the monkey brain did to move its arm in
various ways they then hooked it up to a
prosthetic arm which you see here in the
picture put the arm in another room
pretty soon the computer learned by
reading the monkeys brainwaves to make
that arm in the other room
do whatever the monkeys arm did then he
put a video monitor in the monkeys cage
that showed the monkey this prosthetic
arm and the monkey got fascinated the
monkey recognized that whatever she did
with her arm this prosthetic arm would
do and eventually she was moving it and
moving it and eventually stopped moving
her right arm and staring at the screen
could move the prosthetic arm in the
other room only with her brain waves
which means that monkey became the first
primate in history of the world to have
three independent functional arms and
it&#39;s not just technology that were
putting into animals
this is Tomas de marsay University of
Florida he took 20,000 then 60,000
disaggregated rat neurons so these are
just individual neurons from rats put
them on a chip they self aggregated into
a network became a integrated chip and
he used that as the IT piece of a
mechanism which ran a flight simulator
so now we have organic computer chips
made out of living self aggregating
neurons finally Musa Ivaldi of
Northwestern took a completely intact
independent lamprey eel brain this is a
brain from a lamprey eel it is living
fully intact brain in a nutrient medium
with these electrodes going off to the
sides attached photosensitive sensors to
the brain put it into a cart
here&#39;s the cart the brain is sitting
there in the middle and using this brain
as the sole processor for this cart when
you turn on the light and shine it at
the cart the cart moves towards the
light when you turn it off it moves away
it&#39;s photo philic so now we have a
complete living lamprey Oh brain is it
thinking lamprey eel thoughts sitting
there in its nutrient medium I don&#39;t
know but in fact it is a fully living
brain that we have managed to keep alive
to do our bidding so we are now at the
stage where we are creating creatures
for our own purposes this is a mouse
created by Charles Vacanti of University
of Massachusetts he altered this Mouse
so that it was genetically engineered to
have skin that was less immunoreactive
to human skin put a polymer scaffolding
of an ear under it and created an ear
that could then be taken off the mouse
and transplanted onto a human being
genetic engineering coupled with polymer
physio technology coupled with
xenotransplantation this is where we are
in this process finally not that long
ago craig Venter created the first
artificial cell where he took a cell
took a DNA synthesizer which is a
machine created an artificial genome put
it in the cell and net of a different
cell the genome was not of the cell he
put it in and that cell then reproduced
as the other cell in other words that
was the first creature in the history of
the world that had a computer as its
parent it did not have an organic parent
and so asked The Economist&#39;s the first
artificial organism and its consequences
so you may have thought that the
creation of life was going to happen in
something that looked like that but in
fact that&#39;s not what Frankenstein&#39;s lab
looks like this is what Frankenstein&#39;s
lab looks like this is a DNA synthesizer
and here at the bottom are just bottles
of ATC and G the four chemicals that
make up our DNA chain and so we need to
ask ourselves some questions for the
first time in the history of this planet
we are able to directly design organisms
we can manipulate the plasm of life with
unprecedented power and it confers on us
a responsibility is everything
okay is it okay to manipulate and create
whatever creatures we want do we have
free rein to design animals do we get to
go someday two pets are us and say look
I want a dog I&#39;d like it to have the
head of a dachshund the body of a
retriever maybe some pink fur and let&#39;s
make it glow in the dark does industry
get to create creatures who in their
milk in their blood and their saliva and
other bodily fluids create the drugs and
industrial molecules we want and then
we&#39;re house them as organic
manufacturing machines do we get to
create organic robots where we remove
the autonomy from these animals and turn
them just into our playthings and then
the final step of this once we perfect
these technologies and animals and we
start using them in human beings what
are the ethical guidelines that we will
use then it&#39;s already happening it&#39;s not
science fiction we are not only already
using these things in animals some of
them were already beginning to use on
our own bodies we are now taking control
of our own evolution we are directly
designing the future of the species of
this planet it confers upon us an
enormous responsibility that is not just
the responsibility of the scientists and
the Ephesus or thinking about it and
writing about it now it is a
responsibility of everybody because it
will determine what kind of planet and
what kind of bodies we will have in the
future thanks
