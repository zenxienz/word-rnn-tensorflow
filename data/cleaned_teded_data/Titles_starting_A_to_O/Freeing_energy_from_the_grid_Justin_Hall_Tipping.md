why can&#39;t we solve these problems we
know what they are something always
seems to stop us why I remember March
the 15th 2000 the be 15 iceberg broke
off the Ross Ice Shelf in the newspaper
it said it was all part of a normal
process a little bit further on in the
article and said a loss that would
normally take the ice shelf fifty to a
hundred years to replace that same word
normal had two different almost opposite
meanings if we walk into the b15 iceberg
when we leave here today we&#39;re going to
bump into something a thousand feet tall
76 miles long 17 miles wide and it&#39;s
going to way to gigatonnes I&#39;m sorry
there&#39;s nothing normal about this and
yet I think it&#39;s this perspective of us
as humans to look at our world through
the lens of normal is one of the forces
that stops us developing real solutions
only 90 days after this arguably the
greatest discovery of the last century
occurred it was the sequencing for the
first time of the human genome this is
the code that&#39;s in every single one of
our 50 trillion cells that makes us who
we are and what we are and if we just
take one sells worth of this code and
unwind it it&#39;s a meter long 2 nanometers
thick 2 nanometers is 20 atoms
in thickness and I wondered what if the
answer to some of our biggest problems
could be found in the smallest of places
where the difference between what is
valuable and what is worthless is merely
the addition or subtraction of a few
atoms and what if we could get exquisite
control over the essence of energy the
electron so I started to go around the
world finding the best and brightest
scientists I could at universities whose
collective discoveries have the chance
to take us there and we formed a company
to build on their extraordinary ideas
six and a half years later 180
researchers they have some amazing
developments in the lab i will show you
three of those today such that we can
stop burning up our planet and instead
we can generate all the energy we need
right where we are cleanly safely and
cheaply think of the space that we spend
most of our time tremendous amount of
energy is coming at us from the Sun we
like the light that comes into the room
but in the middle of summer all that
heat is coming into the room that we&#39;re
trying to keep cool in winter exactly
the opposite is happening we&#39;re trying
to heat up the space that we&#39;re in and
all that is trying to get out through
the window would it be really great if
the window could flick back the heat
into the room if we needed it will flick
it away before it came in one of the
materials that can do this is a
remarkable material carbon that has
changed its form in this incredibly
beautiful reaction where graphite is
blasted by a vapor and when the
vaporized carbon condenses it condenses
back into a different form chicken wire
rolled up but this chicken wire carbon
called the carbon nanotube is a hundred
thousand times smaller than the widths
of one of your hairs
it&#39;s a thousand times more conductive
than copper how is that possible one of
the things about working at the nano
scale is things look and act very
differently you think of carbon as black
carbon at the nano scale is actually
transparent and flexible and when it&#39;s
in this form if I combine it with a
polymer and a fix it to your window when
it&#39;s in it&#39;s colored state it will
reflect away all heat and light and when
it&#39;s in its bleach state it will let all
the light and heat through and any
combination in between to change its
state by the way takes two volts from
millisecond pulse once you&#39;ve changed
its state it stays there until he change
its state again as we were working on
this incredible discovery University of
Florida we were told to go down the
corridor to visit another scientist and
he was working on a pretty incredible
thing imagine if we didn&#39;t have to rely
on artificial lighting to get round at
night we&#39;d have to see at night right
this lets you do it it&#39;s a nanomaterial
to nanomaterials the detector and an
imager the total width of it is 600
times and it takes all the infrared
available at night the space of two
small films and is enabling you to play
an image which you can see through I&#39;m
going to show two tedsters the first
time this operating firstly i&#39;m going to
show you the transparency transparency
is key it&#39;s a film that you can look
through and then I&#39;m going to turn the
lights out and you can see of a tiny
film incredible clarity as we are
working on this it dawned on us this is
taking infrared radiation wavelength
converting it into electron what if we
combined it with this suddenly you&#39;ve
converted energy into an electron on a
plastic surface that you can stick on
your window but because it&#39;s flexible it
can be on any surface whatsoever the
power plant of tomorrow is no power
plant
we talked about generating and using we
want to talk about storing energy and
unfortunately the best thing we&#39;ve got
going is something that was developed in
France 150 years ago the lead acid
battery in terms of dollars per what&#39;s
stored it&#39;s simply the best knowing that
we&#39;re not going to put 50 of these in
our basements to store our power we went
to a group at university of texas at
dallas and we gave them this diagram it
was in actually a diner outside dallas
fort worth airport we said could you
build this and these scientists instead
of laughing at us said yeah and what
they built was e-box ebox is testing new
nano materials to park an electron on
the outside hold it until you need it
and then be able to release it and pass
it off being able to do that means that
i can generate energy cleanly
efficiently and cheaply right where i am
it&#39;s my energy and if i don&#39;t need it i
can convert it back up on the window to
energy light and beam it line-of-sight
to your place and for that i do not need
an electric grid between us the grid of
tomorrow is no grid and energy clean
efficient energy will one day be free if
you do this you get the last puzzle
piece which is water
each of us every day need just eight
glasses of this because we&#39;re human when
we run out of water as we are in some
parts of the world and soon to be in
other parts of the world we&#39;re going to
have to get this from the sea and that&#39;s
going to require us to build these
salination plants 19 trillion dollars is
what we&#39;re going to have to spend these
also require tremendous amounts of
energy in fact it&#39;s going to require
twice the world&#39;s supply of oil to run
the pumps to generate the water we&#39;re
simply not going to do that but in a
world where energy is freed and
transmittable easily and cheaply we can
take any water wherever we are and turn
it into whatever we need I&#39;m glad to be
working with incredibly brilliant and
kind scientists no kinder than many of
the people in the world but they have a
magic look at the world and I&#39;m glad to
see their discoveries coming out of the
lab and into the world it&#39;s been a long
time in coming for me 18 years ago I saw
a photograph in the paper it was taken
by kevin carter who went to the Sudan to
document their fam in there I&#39;ve carried
this photograph with me every day since
then it&#39;s picture of a little girl dying
of thirst
by any standard this is wrong it&#39;s just
wrong
we can do better than this we should do
better than this and whenever I go round
to somebody who says you know what
you&#39;re working on something that&#39;s too
difficult it&#39;ll never happen you don&#39;t
have enough money yeah don&#39;t have enough
time there&#39;s something much more
interesting around the corner I say try
saying that to her that&#39;s what I say in
my mind and I just say thank you and I
go on to the next one this is why we
have to solve our problems and I know
the answer as to how is to be able to
get exquisite control over a building
block of nature stuff of life the simple
electron thank
you
