what I thought I would do is I would
start with a simple request I&#39;d like all
of you to to pause for a moment you
wretched weaklings and take stock of
your miserable existence now that was
the advice that Sint Benedict gave his
rather startled followers in the fifth
century it was the advice that I decided
to follow myself when I turned 40 up
until that moment I had been that
classic corporate warrior I was eating
too much I was drinking too much I was
working too hard and I was neglecting my
family and I decided that I would try
and turn my life around in particular I
decided I would try to address the
thorny issue of work-life balance so I
stepped back from the workforce and I
spent a year at home with my wife and
four young children but all I learned
about work-life balance from that year
was that I found it quite easy to
balance work and life when I didn&#39;t have
any work
not a very useful skill especially when
the when the money runs out so I went
back to work and I&#39;ve spent the seven
years since struggling with studying and
writing about work-life balance I have
four observations I&#39;d like to share with
you today the first is if society&#39;s to
make any progress on this issue we need
an honest debate but the trouble is so
many people talk so much rubbish about
work-life balance all the discussions
about flexi time or dress-down Fridays
or paternity leave only serve to mask
the core issue which is that certain job
and career choices are fundamentally
incompatible with being meaningfully
engaged on a day to day basis with a
young family now the first step in
solving any problem is acknowledging the
reality of the situation you&#39;re in and
the reality of the society that we&#39;re in
is there are thousands and thousands of
people out there leading lives of quiet
screaming desperation where they work
long hard hours at jobs they hate to
enable them to buy things they don&#39;t
need to impress people they don&#39;t like
it&#39;s my contention that going to work on
a Friday in jeans and t-shirt isn&#39;t
really getting to the nub of the issue
the second observation I&#39;d like to make
is we need to face the truth that
governments and corporations aren&#39;t
going to solve this issue for us to stop
looking outside it&#39;s up to us as
individuals to take control and
responsibility for the type of lives
that we want to lead if you don&#39;t design
your life someone else will design it
for you and you may just not like their
idea of balance it&#39;s particularly
important this isn&#39;t on the World Wide
Web is it I&#39;m about to get fired it&#39;s
particularly important that you never
put the quality of your life in the
hands of a commercial corporation now
I&#39;m not talking here just about the bad
companies the the abbatoirs of the human
soul as I call them
I&#39;m talking about all companies because
commercial companies are inherently
designed to get as much out of you as
they can get away with it&#39;s in their
nature it&#39;s in their DNA it&#39;s what they
do even the good well-intentioned
companies on the one hand putting
childcare facilities in the work place
is wonderful and enlightened on the
other hand it&#39;s a nightmare that just
means you spend more time at the bloody
office we have to be responsible for
setting and enforcing the boundaries
that we want in our life the third
observation is we have to be careful
with the time frame that we choose upon
which to judge our balance before I went
back to work
after my year at home I sat down and I
wrote out a detailed step-by-step
description of the ideal balance day
that I aspired to and it went like this
wake up well rested after a good night&#39;s
sleep
have sex walk the dog have breakfast
with my wife and children have sex again
drive the kids to school on the way to
the office do three hours work play
sport with a friend at lunchtime do
another three hours work meet some mates
in the pub for an early evening drink
drive home for dinner with my wife and
kids meditate for half an hour have sex
walk the dog have sex again go to bed
how often do you think I had that day we
need to be realistic you can&#39;t do it all
in one day
we need to elongate the time frame upon
which we judge the balance in our life
but we need to elongate it without
falling into the trap of the I&#39;ll have a
life when I retire when my kids have
left home meant work my wife has
divorced me my health is failing
I&#39;ve got no mates or interests left a
days too short
after I retire is too long it&#39;s got to
be a middle way a fourth observation we
need to approach balance in a balanced
way a friends came to see me last year
she doesn&#39;t mind me telling the story a
friend came to see me last year and said
Nigel I&#39;m read your book and I realized
that my life is completely out of
balance it&#39;s totally dominated by work I
worked 10 hours a day I commute two
hours a day all my relationships have
failed there&#39;s nothing in my life apart
from my work so I&#39;ve decided to get a
grip and sort it out
so I&#39;ve joined the gym
now I don&#39;t mean to mock but being a fit
10 hour a day office rat isn&#39;t more
balanced it&#39;s more fit
lovely though physical exercise maybe
there are other paths to life
there&#39;s the intellectual side there&#39;s
the emotional side there&#39;s the spiritual
side and to be balanced I believe we
have to attend to all of those areas not
just do 50 stomach crunches now that can
be daunting because people say bloody
hell mate I haven&#39;t got time to get fit
he want me to go to church and call my
mother and I understand I truly
understand how that can be daunting but
an incident that happened a couple of
years ago gave me a new perspective my
wife who is somewhere in the audience
Tudor he called me up at the office and
say no I do it you need to pick our
younger son up Harry from school she had
to be somewhere else we&#39;ve got other
three children for that evening so I
left work an hour early that afternoon
and picked Harry up at the school gates
we walk down to the local park messed
around on the swings play some silly
games I then walked him up the hill to
the local cafe and we shared a pizza for
tea then walk down the hill to our home
and I gave him his bath and put him in
his Batman pajamas I then read him a
chapter of Roald Dahl&#39;s James and the
Giant Peach I didn&#39;t put him to bed
tucked him in getting the kiss on his
forehead and said good night mate and
walked out of his bedroom as I was
walking out of his bedroom he said dad
like yes mate he went down this has been
the best day of my life ever I haven&#39;t
done anything
hadn&#39;t taken to Disney World and bought
him a Playstation now my point is the
small things matter being more balanced
doesn&#39;t mean dramatic upheaval in your
life
with the smallest investment in the
right places you can radically transform
the quality of your relationships and
the quality of your life moreover I
think it can transform society because
if enough people do it we can change
scientists definition of success away
from the moronically simplistic notion
that the person with the most money when
he dies wins to a more thoughtful and
balanced definition of what a life
well-lived looks like and that I think
is an idea worth spreading
