can I ask you to please recall a time
when you really love something a movie
and album a song or a book and you
recommended it wholeheartedly to someone
you also really liked and you anticipate
that reaction you waited for it and it
came back and the person hated it so by
way of introduction that is the exact
same state in which I spend every
working day of last six years I teach
high school math I I sell a product to a
market that doesn&#39;t want it but is
forced by law to buy it I mean it&#39;s kind
of it&#39;s just a losing proposition so
there&#39;s there&#39;s a useful stereotype
about students that I see a useful
stereotype about you all I could give
you guys a algebra two final exam and
I&#39;d expect no higher than a twenty five
percent pass rate and both of these
facts say it&#39;s a less about you or my
students than they do about what we call
math education in the u.s. today to
start with I&#39;d like to break math down
into two categories one is computation
this is the stuff you&#39;ve forgotten for
example factoring quadratics with
leading coefficient greater than one
okay
this stuff is also really easy to
relearn provided that you have a really
strong grounding in reasoning math
reasoning we&#39;ll call it the the
application of math processes to the
world around us this is hard to teach
this is what we would love students to
retain even if they don&#39;t go into
mathematical fields this is also
something that the way we teach it in
the US all but ensures they won&#39;t retain
it so I&#39;ll talk about why that is why
that&#39;s such a calamity for society what
we can do about it and to close with why
this is an amazing time to be a math
teacher
okay so first five five symptoms that
you&#39;re doing math reasoning wrong in
your classroom okay one is a lack of
initiative your students don&#39;t self
start you finish your lecture block and
immediately have five hands going up
asking you to re-explain an entire thing
at their desks students lack
perseverance they lack retention you
find yourself reading concepts three
months later wholesale there&#39;s an
aversion to word problems which
describes 99% of my students and then
the other 1% are eagerly looking for the
formula to apply in that situation okay
this is really destructive David Milt a
creator of Deadwood and other
amazing TV shows has a really good
description for this
he swore off creating a contemporary
drama shows set in the present day
because he saw that when people fill
their mind with four hours a day for
example two and a Half Men
no disrespect it shapes the neural
pathways he said in such a way that they
expect simple problems he called it an
impatience with a resolution you&#39;re
impatient with things that don&#39;t resolve
quickly you expect sitcom size problems
that wrap up in 22 minutes three
commercial breaks and us and a laugh
track and I&#39;ll put it to all of you what
you already know that no problem we&#39;re
solving is that simple I am very
concerned about this because the I&#39;m
going to retire in a world that my
students will run I&#39;m doing I&#39;m doing
I&#39;m doing bad things to my own future
and well-being when I teach this way I&#39;m
here to tell you that the way our
textbooks particularly mass adopted
textbooks teach math reasoning and
patient problem-solving it&#39;s
functionally equivalent to turning on
Two and a Half Men and calling it a day
in all seriousness here&#39;s an example
from a physics textbook it applies
equally to math notice first of all here
that you have exactly three pieces of
information there each of which will
figure into a formula somewhere
eventually which the student will then
compute okay I believe in real life and
ask yourselves what problem have you
solved ever
that was worth solving where you knew
all of the given information in advance
or you didn&#39;t have a surplus of
information and you had to filter it out
or you didn&#39;t have insufficient
information and had to go find some I&#39;m
sure we all agree that no problem we&#39;re
solving is like that and the textbook I
think knows how it&#39;s hamstringing
students because watch this this is the
practice problem set when it comes time
to the actual problem set you have
problems like this right here where
we&#39;re just swapping out numbers and
tweaking the context a little bit and
the student still doesn&#39;t recognize the
stamp this is molded from it helpfully
explains to you like what what sample
prod you can return to to find the
formula you literally I mean this past
this particular unit without knowing any
physics just knowing how to decode a
textbook that&#39;s a shame so I can
diagnose the problem a little more
specifically in math here&#39;s a really
cool problem I like this it&#39;s about
defining steepness and slope using a
ski-lift but what you have here is
actually
four separate layers I&#39;m curious which
of you can see the four separate layers
and particularly how and they&#39;re
compressed together and present the
student all at once how that creates
that this impatient problem-solving I&#39;ll
define them here you have the visual
okay you also have the mathematical
structure talking about grids
measurements labels points axes that
sort of thing you have sub steps which
all lead to what we really want to talk
about which section is the steepest so I
hope you can see I really hope you can
see how what we&#39;re doing here is taking
a compelling question a compelling
answer but we&#39;re paving a smooth
straight path from one to the other and
congratulate our students for how well
they can step over the small cracks in
the way that&#39;s all we&#39;re doing here so I
want to put to you if we can separate
these in a different way and build them
up with students we can have everything
we&#39;re looking for in terms of patient
problem solving right here I start with
the visual and I immediately ask the
question which section is the steepest
and this starts conversation because the
visual is created in such a way where
you can defend two answers so we get
people arguing against each other friend
versus friend impairs journaling
whatever and then eventually we realize
it&#39;s it&#39;s getting annoying to talk about
the skier in the lower left hand side of
the screen or the skier just above the
midline and we realized how great would
it be if we just had some a B C and D
labels to talk about them more easily
and then and then as we start to define
like what what does steepness mean we
realized it&#39;d be nice to have some
measurements so really narrow it down
specifically what that means and then
and only then we throw down that
mathematical structure the math serves
the conversation the conversation
doesn&#39;t serve the math and at that point
I&#39;ll put it to that nine out of ten
classes are good to go on the whole
slope steepness thing but if you need to
your students can then develop those sub
steps together do you guys see how this
right here compared to that which one
creates that patient problem solving
that map reasoning it&#39;s been obvious in
my practice to me and I&#39;ll yield the
floor here for a second to Einstein who
I believe is paid his dues he talked
about the formulation of prom being so
incredibly important and yet in my
practice in the u.s. here we just give
problems of student we don&#39;t involve
them in the formulation of the problem
so 90% of what I do with my five hours
of prep time per week is it take
compelling elements of problems like
this my textbook and rebuild them in a
way that supports math reasoning and
patient problem-solving and here&#39;s how
it works I like this question it&#39;s about
a water tank the question is how long
will it take you to fill it up okay
first things first we eliminate all the
sub steps
students have to develop those they have
to formulate those and then notice that
all the information written on there is
stuff you&#39;ll need none of it&#39;s a
distractor so we lose that students need
to decide
all right well does the height matter
does the side length matter does the
color of the valve matter what matters
here is such an underrepresented
question math curriculum so now we have
a water tank how long will it take you
to fill it up and that&#39;s it and because
this is the 21st century and we would
love to talk about the real world on its
own terms not in terms of line art or
clip art that you so often see in
textbooks we go out and take a picture
of it so now we have the real deal how
long will it take it to fill it up and
then even better is we take a video a
video of someone filling it up and it&#39;s
filling up slowly agonizingly slowly
it&#39;s tedious students are looking at
their watches rolling their eyes and
they&#39;re all wondering at some point or
another man how long is it going to take
to fill up
that&#39;s how you know you baited the hook
right and and that question off this
right here is really fun for me because
like I like the intro I teach I teach
kids because of my inexperience I teach
the kids that are the most remedial
alright and I got kids who will not join
a conversation about math because
there&#39;s like someone else has the
formula someone else knows how to work
the formula better than me so I won&#39;t I
won&#39;t talk about it but here every
student is on the level playing field of
intuition like everyone&#39;s filled
something up with water before so I get
kids answering the question how long
will it take I got kids who are who are
mathematically and conversationally
intimidated joining the conversation
when you put we put names on the board
attach them to guesses and kids have
bought in here and then we follow the
process I described and the best part
here or one of the better parts is that
we don&#39;t get our answer from the answer
key in the back of the teachers edition
we instead just watch the end of the
movie and that&#39;s terrifying
all right because the theoretical models
that always work out in the answer key
the back of a teacher&#39;s edition like
that&#39;s great but it&#39;s scary to talk
about sources of error when the
theoretical does not match up at the
practical but those conversations have
been so valuable among the most valuable
so I&#39;m here to report some really fun
games with students who come
pre-installed these viruses day one of
the class okay these are kids who who
now one semester in I can put something
on the board totally new totally foreign
and they&#39;ll have a conversation about it
for three or four minutes more than they
would have started the year which is
which is just so fun we&#39;re no longer
averse to word problems because we&#39;ve
redefined what a word problem is we&#39;re
no longer intimidated by math because
we&#39;re slowly redefining what math is
this has been a lot of fun
I encourage Matthews as I talked to to
use multimedia because it brings the
real world into your classroom and
high-resolution in full color to
encourage student intuition for that
level playing field to ask the shortest
question you possibly can and let those
more specific questions come out in
conversation to let students build the
problem because Einstein said so and to
finally in total just be less helpful
because a textbook is helping you in all
the wrong ways is helping you it&#39;s
buying you out of your obligation for
patient problem solving in math three
reasoning to be less helpful and why
this is an amazing time to be a math
teacher right now it&#39;s because we have
the tools to create this high-quality
curriculum in our front pocket it&#39;s
ubiquitous and fairly cheap and the
tools to distribute it freely under open
licenses has also never been cheaper or
more ubiquitous I put a video series on
my blog not so long ago it got a six
thousand views in two weeks I get emails
still from from teachers and countries
I&#39;ve never visited saying wow yeah we
had a good conversation about that oh
and by the way here&#39;s how I made your
stuff better which Wow
I put this problem on my blog recently
in a grocery store which which line do
you get into the one that has one car in
19 items with line withwith four carts
and three five two and one items linear
modeling involving that with some good
stuff in my classroom but it eventually
got me on Good Morning America a few
weeks later which is just bizarre right
and from all of this I can only conclude
that people not just students are really
hungry for this math makes sense of the
world math is the vocabulary for your
own intuition so I just really encourage
you whatever your stake is in education
whether you&#39;re a student parent teacher
policymaker whatever it&#39;s insist on
better math curriculum we need more
patient problem solvers thank you
