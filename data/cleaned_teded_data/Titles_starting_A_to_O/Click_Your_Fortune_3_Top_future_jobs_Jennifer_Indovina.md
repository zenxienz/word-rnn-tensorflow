It&#39;s really funny,
we&#39;re starting to see
so many more titles coming in
that are &quot;Creative Director&quot;
or &quot;Director of Innovation,&quot;
and I feel like our generation
is going to, kind of, see past that
and understand that every single employee
needs to have creativity
in everything that they do everyday,
that&#39;s this element of our work
that&#39;s been lost over the past 20 years,
and I think it&#39;s going to get integrated back in.
I don&#39;t know how to say this any other way,
but I hope every company around the world
gets rid of their HR departments
because it ruins communication, and
I&#39;ll start over and I&#39;ll try to think of an actual job,
but maybe you guys can help me.
What&#39;s a job that&#39;s like anti-HR?
Is there a job that&#39;s like anti-HR?
Ah, I don&#39;t know,
like master chopper,
like guillotine guy,
like &quot;And you&#39;re done, like, leave.&quot;
I don&#39;t know of the anti-HR job.
Probably the easiest answer would be
the jack-of-all-trades guy.
Every company sort of has someone
in their company that they go to
for matters that there is no title for,
whether it&#39;s, &quot;I have a communication issue,&quot;
or &quot;I don&#39;t like the project I&#39;m on right now.&quot;
And I feel like that sort of jack-of-all-trades job
has yet to really define itself,
but it will,
and when we know it, we&#39;ll see it.
