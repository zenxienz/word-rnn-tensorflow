Actually,
and this goes back to,
you know, questions I ask people in interviews,
the ability to think critically
is a skill that translates
to every single job,
so I always look at that.
If somebody doesn&#39;t have the specific skill set
that I need for a particular job
but has demonstrated an ability
to think around difficult problems,
to route around things,
connect people,
that, you can train people on individual skills,
it&#39;s that real foundation,
the ability to communicate with people,
analyze problems,
those are critical things.
