Mysteries of vernacular:
Dynamite,
an explosive consisting of nitroglycerin,
typically molded into sticks.
Dynamite, which coincidentally is closely related
to the word dynasty,
has as much to do with familial persuasion
as it does etymology.
Following in the footsteps of his inventor father,
Alfred Nobel took up engineering.
In 1850, he was exposed to the work of Ascanio Sobrero,
the chemist who invented nitroglycerin.
More powerful than gun powder
and extremely unpredictable,
this highly explosive liquid captivated Alfred.
Working closely with his father,
he began experimenting with nitroglycerin,
searching for a practical application for the compound.
After several explosions,
including one that killed Alfred&#39;s brother,
authorities banned nitroglycerin tests
within Stockholm city limits.
Undeterred, Alfred moved his lab
and began experimenting with additives,
eventually finding one that transformed
the dangerous liquid into malleable paste,
easier to handle
and perfect for construction sites.
He named this material dynamite,
from the Greek dunamis,
meaning power,
and the common scientific suffix -ite.
Explosives made Alfred a very wealthy man.
And, in an effort to balance
the destruction caused by his invention,
he created an endowment
that would award Nobel Prizes
to authors,
scientists,
and advocates of world peace
for generations to come.
