just looked at it and I didn&#39;t know what
to do I mean this was was I my things I
always live in the present I love the
present I cherished the future and I was
taught some strange thing as a kid like
you got to make something good out of
something bad you got to make something
good out of something bad this was bad

window outside of Santa Cruz in Bonnie
doing just 35 miles from here thank you
everybody
they have names like idle time books and
Panther coffee with free enterprise puns
like hue and cry and smash records and
one Saturday a year
small businesses remind a nation of the
benefits of shopping small like the way
David Kaplan at Shell lumber shows you
how to use a chop saw then invites you
back when the warehouse becomes the
community theater or the way Camille
rustler of Everafter
travels the journey from despair to
bliss with every bride-to-be on just one
day 100 million of us joined a movement
and Main Street found its you might
again and Main Street found its fight
again and we the locals found delight
again that&#39;s the power of all that&#39;s the
power that&#39;s the power of all that&#39;s the
membership effect of American Express
you
