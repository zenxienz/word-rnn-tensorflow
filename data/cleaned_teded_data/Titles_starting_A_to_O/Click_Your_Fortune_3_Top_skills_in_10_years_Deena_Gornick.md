It is, technology and all that stuff,
is really important,
but those can be learned.
I think emotional intelligence
is the key differentiator in the market,
and I think that&#39;s true now,
and I think it will be even truer in 10 years.
If you can communicate,
if you can have humility,
if you can have compassion,
if you can make a connection with somebody
in an authentic way,
then I think that you will succeed.
And I think that&#39;s absolutely more important
than an incredible CV or resume.
I just think that is vital,
if you can get along with people,
because collaboration is where we are headed,
or we&#39;re dead.
