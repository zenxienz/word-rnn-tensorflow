I&#39;m inspired by a lot of people that are go-getters,
so people that kind of make things happen inspire me.
They&#39;re everyday people,
to be totally honest with you.
Ah, I&#39;m inspired,
one of my mentors is the owner of &lt;em&gt;Time Out&lt;/em&gt; magazine.
And he inspires me because he did,
he set it up himself when he was,
ah, he got a grant from his grandmother
of like 500 pounds,
and thirty years later
he&#39;s still a well-known, global brand.
So, people like that inspire me,
people that make things happen.
