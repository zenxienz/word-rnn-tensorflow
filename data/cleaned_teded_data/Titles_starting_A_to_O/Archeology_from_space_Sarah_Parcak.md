when I was a child growing up in Maine
one of my favorite things to do was to
look for sand dollars on the seashores
of Maine because my parents told me it
would bring me luck but you know these
shells they&#39;re hard to find they&#39;re
covered in sand they&#39;re difficult to see
however over time I got used to looking
for them I started seeing shapes and
patterns that help me to collect them
this this grew into a passion for
finding things a love for the past in
archaeology and eventually when I
started studying Egyptology I realized
that that seeing with my naked eyes
alone wasn&#39;t enough because all of a
sudden in Egypt my Beach had grown from
a tiny beach in Maine to 1 800 miles
long next to the Nile and my sand
dollars had grown to the size of cities
this is really what brought me to using
satellite imagery we&#39;re trying to map
the past I knew that I had to see
differently so i want to show you an
example of how we see differently using
the infrared this is a site located in
the eastern egyptian delta called bendis
and the site visibly appears brown but
when we use the infrared and we process
it all of a sudden using false color the
site appears is bright pink what you are
seeing are the actual chemical changes
to the landscape caused by the building
materials and activities of the ancient
Egyptians what I want to share with you
today is how we&#39;ve used satellite data
to find an ancient Egyptian city called
itch towie missing for thousands of
years it&#39;s Howie was ancient Egypt&#39;s
capital for over 400 years at a period
of time called the Middle Kingdom about
4,000 years ago the site is located in
the volume of Egypt and the sides really
important because in the Middle Kingdom
that was this great Renaissance for
ancient Egyptian art architecture and
religion Egyptologists have always known
the site of the chital was located
somewhere near the pyramids of the two
kings who built it indicated within the
red circles here but somewhere within
this massive flood plain this area is
huge it&#39;s four miles by three miles in
size now the Nile used to flow right
next to the city of each Tower and as it
shifted and changed and moved over time
to the east it covered over the city so
how do you find a barrage city in a vast
landscape finding it randomly would be
the equivalent of locating a needle in a
haystack blindfolded wearing baseball
mitts so what we did is we use NASA
topography data to map out the landscape
very subtle changes we were started to
be able to see where the Nile used to
flow but you can see in more detail and
even more interesting this very slight
raised area seen within the circle
appeared which we thought could possibly
be the location of the city of its Howie
so we collaborated with egyptian
scientist to do coring work which you
see here when I say coring it&#39;s it&#39;s
like I scoring but instead of layers of
climate change are looking for layers of
human occupation and five meters down
underneath a thick layer of mud we found
a dense layer of pottery what this shows
is that at this possible location but
chitali five meters down we have a layer
of occupation for several hundred years
dating to the Middle Kingdom dating to
the exact period of time we think it&#39;s
joey is we also found worked stone
carnelian quartz an agate this shows
that there was a jewelers workshop here
these might not look like much but when
you think about the most common stones
used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom
these are the stones that were used so
we have a dense layer of Occupation
dating to the Middle Kingdom at the site
we also have evidence of an elite
jewelers workshop showing that whatever
was there was a very important city no
its tally was here yet but we&#39;re going
to be returning to the site in the near
future to map it out and even more
importantly we have funding to train
young Egyptians in the use of satellite
technology so they can be the ones
making great discoveries as well so I
wanted to end with my favorite
quote from the Middle Kingdom it&#39;s
probably written at the city of it&#39;s
Howie four thousand years ago sharing
knowledge is the greatest of all
callings there&#39;s nothing like it in the
land so as it turns out Ted was not
founded in nineteen eighty four eighty
making ideas happen hat actually
actually started in nineteen eighty four
bc at a not lost for long city found
from above it certainly puts finding
seashells by the seashore in perspective
thank you very much
