I don&#39;t make it much of a secret,
but I get quite frustrated
when young people we work with
don&#39;t make the most of the opportunities
that they&#39;re provided.
So, just to give you some context,
we provide, on our website,
there&#39;s a plethora of opportunities
from some of the biggest organizations
in the country,
and you&#39;ll just get sometimes
a lethargic response from young people,
and I&#39;m just like,
&quot;God, like, do you know how amazing this is
to just have it served to you on a plate,
and you&#39;re kind of like, hmmmm?&quot;
That frustrates me quite a lot,
and I have to,
I have to kind of keep that undercover.
