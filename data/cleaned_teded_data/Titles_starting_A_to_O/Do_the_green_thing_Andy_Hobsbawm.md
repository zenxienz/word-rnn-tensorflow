great creativity in times of need we
need great creativity discuss great
creativity is astonishingly absurdly
rationally irrationally powerful great
creativity can spread tolerance champion
freedom make education seem like a
bright idea great creativity can turn a
spotlight on deprivation or show that
deprivation ain&#39;t necessarily so great
creativity can make politicians
electable or party&#39;s unelectable it can
make war seem like tragedy or farce
creativity is the meme maker that puts
slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on
our lips
it&#39;s the Pathfinder that shows us a
simple road through an impenetrable
moral maze science is clever but great
creativity is something less knowable
more magical and now we need that magic
this is a time of need our climate is
changing quickly too quickly and great
creativity is needed to do what it does
so well to provoke us to think
differently with dramatic creative
statements to tempt us to act
differently with delightful creative
scraps here is one such scrap from an
initiative uninvolved in using
creativity to inspire people to be
greener you know rather than drive today
I&#39;m going to walk and so he won and as
he walked he saw a thing
strange and wonderful things he would
not otherwise have seen a deer with
like a flying motorcycle father and
daughter separated from a bicycle by a
mysterious wall and then he stopped
walking in front of him was her the
woman who has a child had skipped with
him through fields and broken his heart
sure she&#39;d aged a little the fact she
dates a lot but he fought all his old
passion for a return for he called
softly that was her name don&#39;t say
another word got thee she said but that
was his name I know a tent next to a
caravan exactly 300 yards from here
let&#39;s go there make love in the tent for
it undress she spread one leg and then
the other gusty enter her boldly and
made love to her rhythmically while she
filmed him because she was a keen
amateur pornographer the earth move for
both of them and they live together a
happily ever after and all because he
decided to walk that day
we&#39;ve got the science we&#39;ve had the
debate the moral imperative is on the
table great creativity is needed to take
it all make it simple and sharp to make
it connect to make it make people want
to act so this is a call a plea to the
incredibly talented Ted community let&#39;s
get creative against climate change and
let&#39;s do it soon thank you what does a
machine know about itself can it know
when it needs to be repaired and when it
doesn&#39;t in industries like manufacturing
and energy they&#39;re using predictive
analytics to detect signs of trouble
helping some companies save millions on
maintenance because machines seek help
before they&#39;re broken and don&#39;t when
they&#39;re not that&#39;s what I&#39;m working on
I&#39;m an IBM er let&#39;s build a smarter
planet
