I was sitting with my girls and joy said
dad I wish you&#39;d get off my back my
daddy he calls me all the time lucky for
you he calls it all said jasmine I
haven&#39;t heard from my dad in years at
this moment I knew the girls needed a
way to connect with their fathers and
camp diva my nonprofit organization we
have these types of conversations all
the time as a way to help girls of
African descent prepare for their
passage into womanhood these girls just
needed a way to invite their fathers
into their lives on their own terms so I
asked the girls how can we help other
girls develop healthy relationships with
their fathers let&#39;s have a dance one
girl shouted and all the girls quickly
backed her up they started dreaming
about the decorations invitations the
dresses they were going to wear and what
their fathers could and could not wear
it was off and running before I could
even blink my eyes but even if I could
have slowed down those girls I wouldn&#39;t
have because one thing that I have
learned from over a decade of working
with girls is that they already know
what they need the wisdom lives inside
of them as long as they have
infrastructure mentorship and resources
they could build what they need not only
to survive but to thrive so we had a
dance
and girls and their fathers came in
multitude they were dressed to the nine
they acted sweet they acted silly they
really enjoyed each other&#39;s company it
was a huge success and the girls decided
to make it an annual event so as the
seasons change and it was time to plan
the dance again one girl named Brianna
spoke up and she said my dad can&#39;t come
to the dance and this whole thing is
making me sad why not the girls acts
because he&#39;s in jail she bravely omitted
well can he just get off for a day one
of the girls ass and come in shackles
that&#39;s worse than not having him here at
all at this moment I saw an opportunity
for the girls to rise to the occasion
and to become their own heroes so I acts
what do you think we should do about
this we want every girl to experience
the dance right so the girls thought for
a moment and one girl suggested why
don&#39;t we just take the dance in the jail
most of the girls doubt it the
possibility of that and said are you
crazy who is going to allow a bunch of
little girls dressed up
to come ass out of jail and dance what
their daddies in spongebob suits because
that&#39;s what they called them I said
girls well well you never know unless
you ask so a letter was written to the
Richmond City Sheriff signed
collectively by each girl and I would
have to say he is a very special Sheriff
he contacted me immediately and said
whenever there is an opportunity to
bring families inside his doors are
always open because one thing he did
know that when fathers are connected to
their children it is less likely that
they will return so 16 inmates and 18
girls were invited the girls were
dressed in their Sunday best and the
father&#39;s traded in their yellow and blue
jumpsuits for shirt and tasks they hoped
they shared a full catered meal of
chicken and fish they laugh together it
was beautiful the fathers and daughters
even experienced the opportunity to have
a physical connection something that a
lot of them didn&#39;t even have for a while
fathers were in a space where they were
able to make their daughters plate and
pull out her chair and extend his hand
for a dance even the guards cry but
after the dance we all realized that
that still would be in jail so we needed
to create something that they could take
with them so we brought and flip cams
and we had them look at the flip cams
and just interview each other&#39;s their
messages their thoughts this was going
to be used as a touchstone so when they
started to miss each other and feel
disconnected they could reconnect
through this image I never forget that
one girl looked in her father&#39;s eyes
with that camera and said daddy when you
look at me what do you see because our
daddies are our mirrors that we reflect
back on when we decide about what type
of man we deserve and how they see us
for the rest of our lives I know that
very well because I was one of the lucky
girls I have had my father in my life
always he&#39;s even here today
and that is why it is extremely special
for me to make sure that these girls are
connected to their fathers especially
those who are separated because of
barbed wires and metal doors we have
just created a forum for girls who have
heavy questions on their heart to be in
a position to ask their fathers those
questions and given the father&#39;s the
freedom to answer because we know that
the fathers are even leaving with this
one thought what type of woman and I
preparing to put in the world because a
father is locked in does not mean he
should be locked out of his daughter&#39;s
life
you
