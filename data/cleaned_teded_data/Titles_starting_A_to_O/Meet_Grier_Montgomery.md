I&#39;m Grier Montgomery, and I&#39;m 14 years old.
I&#39;m bullied.
Yeah.
I had friends in elementary school
that I was really close with.
In middle school, they started hanging around other kids,
and, uh,
they called me faggot,
and, um,
they would, you know, hit me and stuff.
They were mean to me.
It wasn&#39;t cool
and it especially hurt
because they were my best friends
and they knew my parents and I knew their parents,
and, you know,
it was just weird.
They were angry about school,
they were angry about home,
they were angry that this kid was walking here
and thought he was cool,
and so they beat him up.
And that kid was me.
We&#39;re all under so much pressure.
I have friends that their parents don&#39;t accept anything
below a 90 average.
I know kids that have high blood pressure,
and they&#39;re 15,
and that&#39;s ridiculous
for kids to stress out about grades
when they&#39;re trying just to fit into their own bodies
and, you know, figure out their way in the world.
I&#39;ll go to sleep at night
and I&#39;ll know that there&#39;s two assignments that I&#39;m missing
or an assignment that I haven&#39;t done,
and I feel this anxiety.
It&#39;s like a fist in my chest.
It sometimes keeps me up
and, because I know
that somebody&#39;s going to be disappointed in me.
I don&#39;t like the academic classes,
but, you know, the arts is what I live for.
If it wasn&#39;t for theater,
I think I definitely would have dropped out of school.
I get to act and do improv
and have fun with my classmates
and do something I love, you know, every day.
I want to be important in my life,
and I want to make some sort of mark on the world.
Yeah.
