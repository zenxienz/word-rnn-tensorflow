this is my grandfather this is my son my
grandfather taught me to work with wood
when I was a little boy and he also
taught me the idea that if you cut down
the tree to turn it into something honor
that trees life and make it as beautiful
as you possibly can my little boy
reminded me that for all the technology
and all the toys in the world sometimes
just a small block of wood if you stack
it up tall actually it&#39;s an incredibly
inspiring thing these are by buildings I
built all around the world out of our
office in Vancouver in New York and we
build buildings of different sizes and
styles and different materials depending
on where we are but wood is the material
that I love the most and I&#39;m going to
tell you the story about wood and part
of the reason i love it is that every
time people go into my buildings that
are would I noticed they react
completely differently I&#39;ve never seen
anybody walk into one of my buildings
and hug us steel or concrete column but
I&#39;ve actually seen that happen in my in
a wood building I&#39;ve actually seen how
people touch the wood and I think
there&#39;s a reason for it just like
snowflakes no two pieces of wood can
ever be the same anywhere on earth
that&#39;s a wonderful thing i like to think
that would gives Mother Nature
fingerprints in our buildings its mother
natures fingerprints that make our
buildings connect us to nature in the
built environment now I live in
Vancouver near a forest that grows to
thirty three stories tall down the coast
here in California the redwood forest
grows to 40 stories tall but the
buildings that we think about in wood
are only four stories tall in most
places on earth even building codes
actually limit the ability for us to
build much taller than four stories in
many places and that&#39;s true here in the
United States now there are exceptions
but there needs to be some exceptions
and things are going to change I&#39;m
hoping and the reason I think that way
is that today half of us live in cities
and that number is going to grow to 75
percent
cities and density mean that our
buildings are going to continue to be
big and I think there&#39;s a role for wood
to play in cities and I feel that way
because three billion people in the
world today over the next 20 years will
need a new home that&#39;s forty percent of
the world they&#39;re going to need a new
building built for them in the next 20
years now 1 in 3 people living in cities
today actually live in a slum it&#39;s 1
billion people in the world live in
slums a hundred million people in the
world are homeless the scale of the
challenge for architects and for society
to deal with in building is to find a
solution to house these people but the
challenges as we move to cities cities
are built in these two materials steel
and concrete and they&#39;re great materials
the materials of the last century but
there are also materials with very high
energy and very high greenhouse gas
emissions in their process steel
represents about three percent of man&#39;s
greenhouse gas emissions and concrete is
over five percent so if you think about
that eight percent of our contribution
to greenhouse gases today comes from
those two materials alone we don&#39;t think
about it a lot and then unfortunately we
actually don&#39;t even think about
buildings I think as much as we should
this is a u.s. statistic about the
impact of greenhouse gases almost half
of our greenhouse gases are related to
the building industry and if we look at
energy it&#39;s the same story you&#39;ll notice
a transportation sort of second down
that list but that&#39;s the conversation we
mostly hear about and although a lot of
that is about energy it&#39;s also so much
about carbon the problem I see is that
ultimately the clash of how we solve
that problem of serving those three
billion people that need a home and
climate change our head-on collision
about to happen or already happening
that challenge means that we have to
start thinking in new ways and I think
wood is going to be part of that
solution I&#39;m going to tell you the story
of why as an architect wood is the only
material big material that I can build
with
that&#39;s already grown by the power of the
Sun when a tree grows in the forest and
gives off oxygen and soaks up carbon
dioxide and it dies in a false of the
forest floor it gives that carbon
dioxide back to the atmosphere into the
ground if it burns in a forest fire it&#39;s
going to give that carbon back to the
atmosphere as well but if you take that
would and you put it into a building or
into a piece of furniture or into that
wooden toy it actually has amazing
capacity to store the carbon and provide
us with a sequestration one cubic meter
of wood will store one ton of carbon
dioxide now our two solutions to climate
are obviously to reduce our emissions
and find storage what is the only major
building material I can build with that
actually does both those two things so I
believe that we have an ethic that the
earth grows our food and we need to move
to an ethic in this century that the art
should grow our homes now how are we
going to do that when we&#39;re urbanizing
at this rate and we think about wood
buildings only at four stories we need
to reduce the concrete and steel we need
to grow bigger and what we&#39;ve been
working on is 30 story tall buildings
made of wood we&#39;ve been engineering them
with an engineer in America and named
eric carr she works with me on it and
we&#39;ve been doing this new work because
there are new wood products out there
for us to use and we call them mast
timber panels these are panels made with
young trees small growth trees small
pieces of wood glued together to make
panels that are enormous eight feet wide
sixty-four feet long and of various
thicknesses the way I describe this best
I&#39;ve found is to say that we&#39;re all used
to to buy for construction when we think
about wood that&#39;s what people jump to as
a conclusion 2.4 constructions sort of
like the little eight dot bricks of Lego
that we all played with his kids and you
can make all kinds of cool things out of
Lego at that size and out of
two-by-fours but you remember when
you&#39;re a kid you kind of sift it through
the pile in your basement and you found
that big 24 dot brick of Lego and you&#39;re
kind of like cool this is awesome i can
build something really big and this is
going to be great that&#39;s the change mass
temper panels are those two one
for Doc bricks they&#39;re changing the
scale of what we can do and what we&#39;ve
developed is something we call FFT T
which is a creative common solution to
building a very flexible system of
building with these large panels where
we tilt up six stories at a time if we
want to this animation shows you how the
building goes together in a very simple
way but these buildings are available
for architects and engineers now to
build on four different cultures in the
world different architectural styles and
characters in order for us to build
safely and we&#39;ve engineered these
buildings actually to work in a
Vancouver context where we&#39;re high
seismic zone even a 30 storeys tall now
obviously every time I bring this up
people even you know here at the
conference say are you serious 30
storeys how&#39;s that going to happen and
there&#39;s a lot of really good questions
that are asked and important questions
that we spent quite a long time working
on the answers to as we put together our
report in a peer-reviewed report I&#39;m
just going to focus on a few of them
let&#39;s start with fire because I think
fire is probably the first one that
you&#39;re all thinking about right now yeah
fair enough and the way I describe it is
this if I asked you to take a match and
light it and hold up a log and try to
get that log to go on fire doesn&#39;t
happen right we all know that but to
build a fire you kind of start with
small pieces of wood you work your way
up and eventually you can add the log to
the fire and when you do add the log to
the fire of course it burns but it burns
slowly well mass timber panels these new
products that we&#39;re using are much like
the log it&#39;s hard to start them on fire
and when they do they actually burn
extraordinarily predictably and we can
use fire science in order to predict and
make these buildings as safe as concrete
and a safe of steel the next big issue
deforestation eighteen percent of our
contribution to greenhouse gas emissions
worldwide as the result of deforestation
the last thing we want to do is cut down
trees or the last thing we do is cut
down the wrong trees there are models
for sustainable forestry that allow us
to cut trees properly and those are the
only trees appropriate to use for these
kinds of systems now I actually think
the
these ideas will change the economics of
deforestation in countries with
deforestation issue we need to find a
way to provide better value for the
forest and actually encourage people to
make money through very fast growth
cycles 10 12 15 year old trees that make
these products and allow us to build at
the scale we&#39;ve calculated a 20-story
building will grow enough wood in North
America every 13 minutes that&#39;s how much
it takes the carbon story here is a
really good one if we built a 20-story
building out of cement and concrete the
process would result in the
manufacturing of that cement and 1,200
tons of carbon dioxide if we did it in
wood in this solution we sequester about
3,100 tons for a net difference of 4300
tons that&#39;s the equivalent of about nine
hundred cars removed from the road in
one year think back to that three
billion people that need a new home and
maybe this is a contributor to reducing
we&#39;re at the beginning of a revolution I
hope in the way we build because this is
the first new way to build a skyscraper
in probably a hundred years or more but
the challenge is changing society&#39;s
perception of possibility and it&#39;s a
huge challenge the engineering is
truthfully the easy part of this and the
way I describe it is this the first
skyscraper technically in the definition
of skyscrapers ten stories tall believe
it or not but the first skyscraper was
this one in Chicago and people were
terrified to walk underneath this
building but only four years after was
built Gustave Eiffel was building an
Eiffel Tower and as he built the Eiffel
Tower he changed the skylines of the
cities of the world changed and created
a competition between places like New
York City and Chicago where developers
started building bigger and bigger
buildings and pushing the envelope up
higher and higher with better and better
engineering we built this model in New
York actually on the as a theoretical
model in the campus of a technical
university soon to come and the reason
we picked this site to just show you
what these buildings may look like
because they can the exterior can change
it&#39;s really just the structure that
we&#39;re talking about the reason we picked
it is because this is a technical
university and I
believe that wood is the most
technologically advanced material I can
build with it just happens to be the
mother nature holds the patent and we
don&#39;t really feel comfortable with it
but that&#39;s the way it should be nature&#39;s
fingerprints in the built environment
I&#39;m looking for this opportunity to
create an Eiffel Tower moment we call it
buildings are starting to go up around
the world there&#39;s a building in London
that&#39;s nine stories a bit new building
that just finished in Australia that I
believe is 10 or 11 we&#39;re starting to
push the height up of these wood
buildings and we&#39;re hoping and I&#39;m
hoping that my hometown of Vancouver
actually potentially announces the
world&#39;s tallest at around 20 stories in
the not so distant future that Eiffel
Tower moment will break the ceiling
these arbitrary ceilings of height and
allow wood buildings to join the
competition and I believe the race is
ultimately on thank
you
