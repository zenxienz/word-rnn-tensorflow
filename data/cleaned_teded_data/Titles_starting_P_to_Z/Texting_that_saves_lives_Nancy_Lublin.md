most of you this is a device to buy sell
play games watch videos I think it might
be a lifeline I think actually it might
be able to save more lives than
penicillin texting I know I say texting
and a lot of you think sexting a lot of
you think about the lewd photos that you
see hopefully not your kids sending to
somebody else or trying to translate the
abbreviations LOL LMAO HMU i can help
you with those later but the parents in
the room know that texting is actually
the best way to communicate with your
kids might be the only way to
communicate with your kids the average
teenager sends 3339 text messages a
month unless she&#39;s a girl then it&#39;s
closer to four thousand and the secret
is she opens every single one texting
has a one hundred percent open rate now
the parents are really alarmed it&#39;s a
one hundred percent open right even if
she doesn&#39;t respond to you when you ask
her when she&#39;s coming home for dinner I
promise she read that text and this
isn&#39;t some suburban iphone using teen
phenomena texting actually over indexes
for minority and urban youth I know this
because it dosomething.org which is the
largest organization for teenagers and
social change in America about six
months ago we pivoted and started
focusing on text messaging we&#39;re now
texting out to about two hundred
thousand kids a week about doing our
campaigns to make their schools more
green or to work on homeless issues and
things like that we&#39;re finding at eleven
times more powerful than email we&#39;ve
also found a an unintended consequence
we&#39;ve been getting text messages back
like these I don&#39;t want to go to school
today the boys call me I was
cutting my parents found out and so I
stopped but I just started again an hour
ago
or he won&#39;t stop raping me he told me
not to tell anyone it&#39;s my dad are you
there that last one is an actual text
message that we received and yeah we&#39;re
there I will not forget the day we got
that text message and so it was that day
that we decided we needed to build a
crisis text hotline because this isn&#39;t
what we do we do social change kids are
just sending us these text messages
because texting is so familiar and
comfortable to them and there&#39;s nowhere
else to turn but they&#39;re sending them to
us so think about it a text hotline it&#39;s
pretty powerful it&#39;s fast it&#39;s pretty
private no one hears you in a stall
you&#39;re just texting quietly it&#39;s real
time we could help millions of teens
with counseling and referrals that&#39;s
great but the thing that really makes
this awesome is the data because I&#39;m not
really comfortable just helping that
girl with counseling and referrals I
want to prevent this from happening
so think about a comp there&#39;s something
in New York City that the police did it
used to be just guesswork police work
and then they started crime mapping and
so they started following and watching
petty theft summonses all kinds of
things charting the future essentially
and they found things like when you see
crystal meth on the street if you add
police presence you can curb the
otherwise inevitable fate of assaults
and robberies that would happen in fact
the year after the NYPD put CompStat in
place the murder rate fell 60 percent so
think about the data from a crisis text
line there is no census on bullying and
dating abuse and eating disorders and
cutting and rape no census maybe there&#39;s
some studies some longitudinal studies
that cost lots of money and took lots of
time or maybe there&#39;s some anecdotal
evidence imagine having real-time data
on every one of those issues you can
inform legislation you can inform school
policy you could say to a principal
you&#39;re having a problem every thursday
at three o&#39;clock what&#39;s going on in your
school you could see the immediate
impact of legislation or a hateful
speech that somebody gives in a school
assembly and see what happens as a
result this is really to me the power of
texting and the power of data because
while people are talking about data
making it possible for facebook to mind
my friend from the third grade or target
to know when it&#39;s time for me to bind
more diapers or some dude to build a
better baseball team I&#39;m actually really
excited about the power of data and the
power of texting to help that kid go to
school to help that girl stop cutting in
the bathroom and absolutely to help that
girl whose father is raping her thank
you
