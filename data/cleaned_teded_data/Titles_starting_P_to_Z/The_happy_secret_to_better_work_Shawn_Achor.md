when I was seven years old and my sister
was just five years old we were playing
on top of a bunk bed I was two years
older than my sister at the time I&#39;m am
two years older than her now but at the
time that meant she had to do everything
that I wanted to do and I wanted to play
war so we were up on top of our bunk
beds and on one side of the bunk bed I
had put out all my GI Joe soldiers and
weaponry and on the other side were all
my sisters Milo&#39;s and ponies and ready
for a cavalry charge there are differing
accounts of what actually happened that
afternoon but since my sister is not
here with us today let me tell you the
true story which is my sister&#39;s a little
bit on the clumsy side and somehow
without any help or push from her older
brother at all
suddenly Amy disappeared off the top of
the bunk bed and landed with this crash
on the floor and I never sleep eared
over the side of the bed to see what had
befallen my fallen sister and saw that
she landed painfully on her hands and
knees on all fours on the ground I was
nervous because my parents had charged
me with making sure that my sister and I
played as safely and as quietly as
possible and seeing as how I had
accidentally broken Amy&#39;s arm just one
week before
heroically pushing her out of the way of
an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet for
which I have yet to be thanked I was
trying as hard as I could she didn&#39;t
even see it coming I was trying as hard
as I could to be on my best behavior and
I saw my sister&#39;s faces wail but pain
and suffering and surprise threatening
to erupt from her mouth and threatening
to wake my parents from the long winters
nap for which they had settled so I did
the only thing my little frantic
seven-year-old brain could think to do
to avert this tragedy if you have
children you&#39;ve seen this hundreds of
times before I said Amy Amy wait don&#39;t
cry don&#39;t cry did you see how you landed
no human lands on all fours like that
Amy I think this means you&#39;re a unicorn
now that was cheating because there&#39;s
nothing in the world my sister would
want more than not to be Amy the hurt
five-year-old little sister but Amy the
special unicorn of course this was an
option that was open to her brain to no
point in the past and you could see on
my poor manipulated sister&#39;s face
conflict as their little brain attempted
to devote resources to feeling the pain
and suffering surprise she just
experienced or contemplating her
newfound identity as a unicorn and the
latter one now instead of crying instead
of ceasing our planes of waking my
parents with all the negative
consequences that would have been sued
for me instead of smile spread across
her face and she scrambled right back up
onto the bunk bed with all the grace of
the baby unicorn
with one broken leg what we stumbled
across at this tender age which is five
and seven we had no idea at the time was
something that was going to be at the
vanguard of a scientific revolution
occurring two decades later in the way
that we look at the human brain what we
had stumbled across is something called
positive psychology which is the reason
that I&#39;m here today and the reason that
I wake up every morning when I first
started talking about this research
outside of academia out with companies
in schools the very first thing they
said to never do is to start your talk
with a graph the very first thing I
wanted to do is start my talk with a
graph this graph looks boring but this
graph is the reason that I get excited
and wake up every morning and this graph
doesn t mean anything it&#39;s faked out of
what we found is if I got this data back
studying you here in the room I would be
thrilled because there&#39;s very clearly a
trend that&#39;s going on there and that
means that I can get published which is
all that really matters the fact that
there&#39;s one weird red dot that&#39;s up
above the curve there&#39;s one weird in the
room you know who you are I saw you
earlier that&#39;s no problem
that&#39;s no problem as most of you know
because I can just delete that dot I can
delete that dot because that&#39;s clearly a
measurement error and we know that&#39;s a
measurement error because it&#39;s messing
up my data so one of the very first
things we teach people in economics and
statistics and business and psychology
courses is how in a statistically valid
way do we eliminate the weirdos how do
we eliminate the outliers so that we can
find the line of best fit which is
fantastic if I&#39;m trying to find out how
many advil the average person should be
taking to but if I&#39;m interested in
potential if I&#39;m interested in your
potential or for happiness or
productivity or energy or creativity
what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re creating the
cold to the average with science if I
ask a question like how fast can the
child learn how to read in a classroom
scientists change the answer to how fast
is the average child learn how to read
in that classroom and we tailor the
class right towards the average now if
you fall below the average on this curve
then psychologists get thrilled because
that means you&#39;re either depressed or
you have a disorder or hopefully both
we&#39;re hoping for both because our
business model is if you come into a
therapy session with one problem we want
to make sure you leave knowing you have
10 so you&#39;ll keep coming back over and
over again we&#39;ll go back into your child
have necessary but eventually what we
want to do is to make you normal again
but normal is merely average and what I
pause it and what positive psychology
posits is if we study what is merely
average we will remain merely average
instead of deleting those positive
outliers what I intentionally do is come
into a population like this one and says
why why is it the some of you are so
high above the curve in terms of your
intellectual voting athletic ability
musical ability creativity energy levels
you resiliency in the face of challenge
your sense of humor whatever it is
instead of deleting you what I want to
do is study you because maybe we can
glean information not just how to move
people up to the average but how we can
move the entire average up that our
companies in schools worldwide
the reason this graph is important to me
is when I turn on the news it seems like
the majority of the information is not
positive in fact is negative
most of it&#39;s about murder corruption
diseases natural disasters and very
quickly my brain starts to think that&#39;s
the accurate ratio of negative positive
in the world what that&#39;s doing is
creating something called the medical
school syndrome which if you know people
who have been to medical school during
the first year of medical training as
you read through a list of all the
symptoms and diseases it could happen
suddenly you realize you have all of
them have a brother-in-law named Bobo
which is a whole nother story
Bobo married Amy the Unicorn Bobo called
me on the phone
from Yale Medical School from Yale
Medical School in booboo said Shawn I
have leprosy which even at Yale is
extraordinarily rare but I had no idea
how to console poor Bobo because he had
just gotten over an entire week of
menopause see what we&#39;re finding is not
necessarily the reality that shapes us
but the lens to which your brain views
the world shapes your reality if we can
change the lens not only can we change
your happiness we can change every
single educational business outcome at
the same time when I applied to Harvard
I applied on it there I didn&#39;t expect to
get in and my family had no money for
college when I got a military
scholarship two weeks later that allowed
me to go suddenly something wasn&#39;t even
a possibility became a reality when I
went there I assumed everyone else would
see it as a privilege as well that
they&#39;d be excited to be there even if
you&#39;re in a classroom full of people
smarter than you you&#39;d be happy just to
be in that classroom which is what I
felt but what I found there is while
some people experienced that when I
graduated after my four years and then
spent the next eight years living in the
dorms with the students Harvard asked me
to wasn&#39;t that guy but what happened I
was an officer of Harvard accounts those
students through the difficult four
years and what I found in my research my
teaching is that these students no
matter how happy they were with the
original SAS success of getting into the
school two weeks later the brains were
focused not on the privilege of being
there nor on their philosophy or their
physics the brain was focused on the
competition the workload the hassles the
stresses the complaints when I first
went in there I walked as a freshman
dining hall which is where my friends
from Waco Texas which is where I grew up
I know some of you&#39;ve heard of it when I
when they come to visit me they look
around they say this freshman dining
hall looks like something out of
Hogwarts movie Harry Potter which it
does this Hogwarts movie Harry Potter
and that&#39;s Harvard when they see this
they say Sean why do you waste your time
studying happiness at Harvard seriously
what does a Harvard student possibly
have to be unhappy about embedded within
that question is the key to
understanding the science happiness
because what that question assumes is
that our external world is predictive of
our happiness levels when in reality if
I know everything about your external
world I can only predict ten percent of
your long-term happiness 90 percent of
your long-term happiness is predicted
not by the external world but by it
through the way your brain processes the
world and if we change it if we change
our formula for happiness and success
what we can do is change the way that we
can then affect reality
we found is that only 25% of job
successes are predicted by IQ 75% of job
successes are predicted by your optimism
levels your social support and your
abilities see stress as a challenge
instead of as a threat I talked to a
boarding school up in New England
probably the most prestigious boarding
school and they said we already know
that so every year instead of just
teaching our students we also have a
Wellness Week and we&#39;re so excited
Monday night we have the world&#39;s leading
expert coming in to speak about
adolescent depression Tuesday night is
school violence and bullying Wednesday
night Wednesday nights eating disorders
Thursday night is illicit drug use and
Friday night we&#39;re trying to decide
between risky sex or happiness
I said that&#39;s most people&#39;s Friday
nights
which I&#39;m glad you liked but they did
not like that at all silence on the
phone and into the silence I said I&#39;d be
happy to speak to your school but just
you know that&#39;s not a Wellness Week
that&#39;s the sickness week what you&#39;ve
done is you&#39;ve outlined all the negative
things that can happen but not talked
about the positive the absence of
disease is not health here&#39;s how we get
to health we need to reverse the formula
for happiness and success in the last
three years I&#39;ve traveled to 45
different countries working with schools
and companies in the midst of an
economic downturn and what I found is
the most companies in schools follow a
formula for success which is this if I
work harder I&#39;ll be more successful and
if I&#39;m more successful then I&#39;ll be
happier that undergirds most of our
parenting styles are managing style is
the way that we motivate our behavior
and the problem is it&#39;s scientifically
broken and backwards for two reasons
first every time your brain has a
success you just change the goalposts of
what success look like you got good
grades now you have to get better grades
gone to a good school and after you get
a better school you got a good job now
you have to get a better job you hit
your sales target we&#39;re gonna change
your sales target and if happiness is on
the opposite side of success your brain
never gets there what we&#39;ve done is we
push happiness over the cognitive
horizon as a society and that&#39;s because
we think we have to be successful
successful then we&#39;ll be happier but the
real problem is our brains work in the
opposite order if you can raise the maze
level of positivity in the present then
their brain experiences what we now call
a happiness advantage which is your
brain at positive performs significantly
better than does a negative neutral
stressed your intelligence Rises your
creativity Rises your energy levels rise
in fact what we found is that every
single business outcome improves your
brain and positive is 31% more
productive than d&#39;t your brain and
negative neutral stressed you&#39;re 37%
better at sales
doctors are 19% faster more accurate at
coming up with the correct diagnosis
when positive instead of negative
neutral stress which means we can
reverse the formula if we can find a way
becoming positive in the present then
our brains work even more successfully
as we&#39;re able to work harder faster more
intelligently what we need to be able to
do is reverse this formula so we can
start to see what our brains are
actually capable of because dopamine
which floods into your system when
you&#39;re positive has two functions not
only does it make you happier it turns
on all the learning centers in your
brain allowing you to adapt to the world
in a different way we found that there
are ways you can train your brain to be
able to come more positive in just a two
minute span of time done for 21 days in
row
we can actually rewire your brain
allowing your brain to actually work
more optimistically and more
successfully we&#39;ve done these things in
research now in every single company
that I&#39;ve worked with getting them to
write down three new things that they&#39;re
grateful for for 21 days in a row three
new things each day and at the end of it
their brain starts to retain a pattern
of scanning the world not for the
negative but for the positive first
journaling about one positive experience
you&#39;ve had over the past 24 hours allows
your brain to relive it exercise teaches
your brain your behavior matters we find
that meditation allows your brain to get
over the cultural ADHD that we&#39;ve been
creating by trying to do multiple tasks
at once allows our brains to focus on
the task at hand
and finally random acts of kindness or
conscious acts of kindness we get people
when they open up their inbox to write
one positive email praising or thanking
somebody in their social support network
and by doing these activities and by
training your brain just like we trained
our bodies what we found is we could
reverse the formula for happiness and
success and in doing so not only create
ripples of positivity but create a real
revolution thank you very much
[Applause]
