this story is about taking imaginations
seriously 14 years ago I first
encountered this ordinary material
fishnet used the same way for centuries
today I&#39;m using it to create permanent
billowing voluptuous forms the scale of
hard-edged buildings and cities around
the world I was an unlikely person to be
doing this I never studied sculpture
engineering or architecture in fact
after college I applied to seven art
schools and was rejected by all seven I
went off on my own to become an artist
and I painted for ten years when I was
offered a Fulbright to India promising
to give exhibitions of paintings I
shipped my paints and arrived in
Mahabalipuram the deadline for the show
arrived my paints didn&#39;t I had to do
something this fishing village was
famous for sculpture so I tried bronze
casting but to make large forms was too
heavy and expensive I went for a walk on
the beach watching the fishermen bundle
their nets into mounds on the sand I&#39;d
seen it every day but this time I saw it
differently a new approach to sculpture
a way to make volumetric form without
heavy solid materials my first
satisfying sculpture was made in
collaboration with these fishermen it&#39;s
a self-portrait titled wide hips
we hoisted them on poles to photograph I
discovered their soft surfaces revealed
every ripple of wind in constantly
changing patterns I was mesmerised I
continued studying crafts traditions and
collaborating with artisans next in
Lithuania with lace makers I liked the
fine detail it gave my work but I wanted
to make them larger to shift from being
an object you look at to something you
could get lost in returning to India to
work with those fishermen we made a net
of a million and a half hand tied knots
installed briefly in Madrid thousands of
people saw it and one of them was the
urbanist
Manuel Soler Morales who was redesigning
the waterfront in Porto Portugal
he asked if I could build this as a
permanent piece for the city I didn&#39;t
know if I could do that and preserve my
art durable engineered permanent those
are in opposition to idiosyncratic
delicate and ephemeral for two years I
searched for a fiber that could survive
ultraviolet rays salt air pollution and
at the same time remained soft enough to
move fluidly in the wind we needed
something to hold the net up out there
in the middle of the traffic circle so
we raised this 45 thousand pound steel
ring we had to engineer it to move
gracefully in an average breeze and
survive in hurricane winds but there was
no engineering software to model
something porous and moving
I found a brilliant aeronautical
engineer who designed sails for
America&#39;s Cup racing yachts named Peter
Heppell he helped me tackle the twin
challenges of precise shape and gentle
movement I couldn&#39;t build this the way I
knew because hand tied knots weren&#39;t
going to withstand a her
kein so i developed a relationship with
an industrial fishnet Factory learn the
variables of their machines and figured
out a way to make lace with them there
was no language to translate this
ancient idiosyncratic handcraft into
something machine operators could
produce so we had to create one three
years and two children later we raised
this fifty thousand square-foot lace net
it was hard to believe that what I had
imagined was now built permanent and had
lost nothing in translation this
intersection had been bland and
anonymous now it had a sense of place I
walked underneath it for the first time
as I watched the winds choreography
unfold
I felt sheltered and at the same time
connected to limitless sky my life was
not going to be the same
I want to create these oases of
sculpture in spaces of cities around the
world I&#39;m going to share two directions
that are new in my work historic
Philadelphia City Hall its Plaza I felt
needed a material for sculpture that was
lighter than netting so we experimented
with tiny atomized water particles to
create a dry mist that is shaped by the
wind and in testing discovered it can be
shaped by people who can interact and
move through it without getting wet I&#39;m
using this sculpture material to trace
the paths of subway trains above-ground
in real time like an x-ray of the city&#39;s
circulatory system unfolding next
challenge the biennial of the Americas
in Denver asked could i represent the 35
nations of the Western Hemisphere and
their interconnectedness in a sculpture
I didn&#39;t know where to begin but I said
yes I read about the recent earthquake
in Chile and the tsunami that rippled
across the entire Pacific Ocean it
shifted the Earth&#39;s tectonic plates sped
up the planets rotation and literally
shortened the length of the day so I
contacted NOAA and I asked if they&#39;d
share their data on the tsunami and
translated it into this its title 1.26
refers to the number of microseconds
that the Earth&#39;s day was shortened i
couldn&#39;t build this with a steel ring
the way i knew its shape was too complex
now so i replaced the metal armature
with a soft fine mesh of a fiber 15
times stronger than steel the sculpture
could now be entirely soft which made it
so light it could tie into existing
buildings literally becoming part of the
fabric of the city there was no
where that could extrude these complex
net forms and model them with gravity so
we had to create it then I got a call
from New York City asking if I could
adapt these concepts to Times Square or
the High Line this new soft structural
method enables me to model these and
build these sculptures at the scale of
skyscrapers they don&#39;t have funding yet
but I dream now of bringing these two
cities around the world where they&#39;re
most needed 14 years ago I search for
beauty in the traditional things in
craft forms now I combine them with
high-tech materials and engineering to
create voluptuous billowing forms the
scale of buildings my artistic horizons
continue to grow I&#39;ll leave you with
this story I got a call from a friend in
Phoenix an attorney in the office who&#39;d
never been interested in art never
visited the local art museum dragged
everyone she could from the building and
got them outside to lie down underneath
the sculpture there they were in their
business suits lying in the grass
noticing the changing patterns of wind
beside people they didn&#39;t know sharing
the rediscovery of wonder thank you
thank you
they have names like idle time books and
Panther coffee with free enterprise puns
like hue and cry and smash records and
one Saturday a year
small businesses remind a nation of the
benefits of shopping small like the way
David Kaplan at Shell lumber shows you
how to use a chop saw then invites you
back when the warehouse becomes the
community theater
or the way Camille rustler of Everafter
travels the journey from despair to
bliss with every bride-to-be
absolutely not just one day 100 million
of us joined a movement and Main Street
found its might again and Main Street
found its fight again and we the locals
found delight again that&#39;s the power of
all that&#39;s the power of all it&#39;s the
power of all of us that&#39;s the membership
effect of American Express
