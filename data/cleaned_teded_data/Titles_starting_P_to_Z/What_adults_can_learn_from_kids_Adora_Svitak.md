now I want to start with the question
when was the last time you were called
childish for kids like me being called
childish can be a frequent occurrence
every time we make irrational demands
exhibit irresponsible behavior or
display any other signs of being normal
American citizens we are called childish
which really bothers me after all take a
look at these events imperialism and
colonization world wars george w bush
ask yourself who&#39;s responsible adults
now what have kids done well and Frank
touched millions with her powerful
account of the Holocaust Ruby Bridges
helped to end segregation in the United
States and most recently Charlie Simpson
helped to raise 120 thousand pounds for
Haiti on his little bike so as you can
see evidence by such examples age has
absolutely nothing to do with it the
traits the word childish addresses are
seen so often in adults that we should
abolish this age discriminatory word
when it comes to criticizing behavior
associated with irresponsibility and
irrational thinking
thank you then again who&#39;s to say that
certain types of irrational thinking
aren&#39;t exactly what the world needs
maybe you&#39;ve had grand plans before but
stopped yourself thinking the that&#39;s
impossible or that cost too much or that
won&#39;t benefit me for better or worse
wheat kids aren&#39;t hampered as much when
it comes to think about reasons why not
to do things kids can be full of
inspiring aspirations and hopeful
thinking like my wish that no one went
hungry or that everything or free kind
of utopia how many of you still dream
like that and believe in the
possibilities sometimes a knowledge of
history and the past failures of utopian
ideals can be a burden because you know
that if everything were free then the
food stocks had become depleted and
scarce and leaked chaos on the other
hand we kids still dream about
perfection and that&#39;s a good thing
because in order to make anything a
reality you have to dream about it first
in many ways our audacity to imagine
helps push the boundaries of possibility
for instance the Museum of Glass in
Tacoma Washington my home state you
Washington uh has a program called kids
design glass and kids draw their own
ideas for glass art now the resident
artist said that they got some of their
best ideas from the program because kids
don&#39;t think about the limitations of how
hard it can be to blow glass and the
certain shapes they just think of good
ideas now when you think of glass you
might think of colorful shulie designs
or maybe Italian vases but kids
challenge glass ours to go beyond that
into the realm of broken-hearted snakes
and bacon boys who you can see as meat
vision now our inherent wisdom doesn&#39;t
have to be insiders knowledge kids
already do a lot of learning from adults
and we have a lot to share I think that
adults should start learning from kids
now I do most of my speaking in front of
an education crowd teachers and students
and I like this analogy it shouldn&#39;t
just be a teacher at the head of the
classroom telling students do this do
that
the students should teach their teachers
learning between grownups and kids
be reciprocal the reality unfortunately
is a little different and it has a lot
to do with trust or a lack of it now if
you don&#39;t trust someone you place
restrictions on them right if I doubt my
older sisters ability to pay back the
10% interest she has I established on
her last loan I&#39;m going to withhold her
ability to get more money from me until
she pays it back true story by the way
now adults seem to have adults seem to
have a prevalently restrictive attitude
towards kids from every don&#39;t do that
don&#39;t do this in the school handbook to
restrictions on school internet use as
history points out regimes become
pressive when they&#39;re fearful about
keeping control and although adults may
not be quite at the level of
totalitarian regimes kids have no or
very little saying making the rules when
really the attitude should be reciprocal
meaning that the adult population should
learn and take into account the wishes
of the younger population now what&#39;s
even worse and restriction is the adults
often underestimate kids abilities we
love challenges
but when expectations are low trust me
we will sing to them my own parents had
anything but low expectations for me and
my sister okay so they didn&#39;t tell us to
become doctors or lawyers or anything
like that but my dad did read to us
about Aristotle and pioneer germ
fighters when lots of other kids were
hearing the wheels on the bus go round
and round well we heard that one too but
pioneer germ Fighters totally rules I
love to write from the age of four and
when I was six my mom bought me my own
laptop equipped with Microsoft Word
thank you Bill Gates and thank you mom I
wrote over 300 short stories on that
little laptop and I wanted to get
published instead of just scoffing at
this heresy that kid won to get
published or saying wait until you&#39;re
older my parents were really supportive
many publishers were not quite so
encouraging one large children&#39;s
publisher ironically saying they didn&#39;t
work with children might want to
children&#39;s publisher not work with
children I don&#39;t know you kind of
alienating large client there
now one publisher action publishing was
willing to take that leap and trust me
and listen to what I had to say they
published my first book flying fingers
you see it here and from there on it&#39;s
gone speaking at hundreds of schools
keynote and thousands of educators and
finally today speaking to you I
appreciate your attention today because
to show that you truly care you listen
but there&#39;s a problem with this rosy
picture of kids being so much better
than adults kids grow up and become
adults just like you or just like you
really the goal is not to turn kids into
your kind of adult but rather better
adults than you have been which may be a
little challenging consider your guys
credentials but the way progress happens
is because new generations and new eras
grow and develop and become better than
the previous ones it&#39;s the reason we&#39;re
not in the Dark Ages anymore no matter
your position or place in life it is
imperative to create opportunities for
children so that we can grow up to blow
you away
adults and fellow tedsters you need to
listen and learn from kids and trust us
and expect more from us
you must lend an ear today because we
are the leaders of tomorrow which means
we&#39;re going to be taking care of you in
your old and Sam Isle no just kidding
actually um no really we are going to be
the next generation the one who will
bring this world forward and in case you
don&#39;t think that this really has meaning
for you remember that cloning is
possible and that involves going through
childhood again in which case you&#39;ll
want to be heard just like my generation
now the world needs opportunities for
new leaders and new ideas kids need
opportunities to lead and succeed are
you ready to make the match because the
world&#39;s problems shouldn&#39;t be the human
family&#39;s heirloom thank you
