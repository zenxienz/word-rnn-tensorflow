I&#39;m going to talk about the power of a
word jihad to the vast majority of
practicing Muslims jihad is an internal
struggle for the faith it is a struggle
within struggle against vice sin
temptation lust greed it is a struggle
to try and live a life that is set by
the moral codes written in the Koran in
that original idea the concept of jihad
is as important to Muslims as the idea
of grace is to Christians it&#39;s a very
powerful word jihad if you look at it in
that respect and it desert there&#39;s a
certain almost mystical resonance to it
and that&#39;s the reason why for hundreds
of years Muslims everywhere have named
their children jihad their daughters as
much as their sons in the same way that
say Christians name their daughters
grace and Hindus my people named our
daughters bhakti which means in Sanskrit
spiritual worship but they&#39;ve always
been in Islam a small group a minority
who believe that jihad is not only an
internal struggle but also an external
struggle against forces that would
threaten the faith or the faithful and
some of these people believe that in
that struggle it is sometimes okay to
take up arms and so the thousands of
young Muslim men who flocked to
Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight
against the Soviet occupation of a
Muslim country in their minds they were
fighting a jihad they were doing jihad
and they named themselves the Mujahideen
which is a word that comes from the same
route as jihad and we forget this now
but back then the Mujahideen was
celebrated in this country in America we
thought of them as as holy warriors who
were taking the good fight to the
ungodly calm
honest America gave them weapons gave
them money gave them support
encouragement but within that group a
tiny small group of minority within a
minority within a minority were coming
up with a new dangerous conception of
jihad and in time this group would come
to be led by Osama bin Laden and he
refined the idea his idea of jihad was a
global war of terror primarily targeted
at the far enemy of the Crusaders from
the West against America and the things
he did in the pursuit of this jihad was
so horrendous so monstrous and add such
great impact that his definition was the
one that stuck not just here in the West
we didn&#39;t know any better we didn&#39;t
pause pause to ask we just assumed that
if this insane man and his psychopathic
followers were calling what they did
jihad then that&#39;s what you had must mean
but it wasn&#39;t just us even in the Muslim
world his definition of jihad began to
gain acceptance a year ago I was in
Tunis and I met the the mom of a very
small mosque an old man 15 years ago he
named his granddaughter jihad after the
old meaning he hoped that a name like
that would inspire her to live a
spiritual life he told me that after 911
he began to have second thoughts he
worried that if he called her by that
name especially outdoors outside in
public he might be seen as endorsing bin
Laden&#39;s idea of jihad on Fridays in his
mosque he gave sermons trying to reclaim
the meaning of the word but his
congregants the people who came to his
mosque they had seen the videos they had
seen pictures of the planes going into
the towers at towers coming down there
heard bin Laden say that that was jihad
claimed victory for it and so the older
mom worried that his words were falling
on deaf ears no one was paying attention
he
wrong some people were paying attention
but for the wrong reasons the United
States at this point was putting
pressure on all its Arab allies
including Tunisia to stamp out extremism
in their societies and this Imam found
himself suddenly in the crosshairs of
the Tunisian intelligence service they&#39;d
never paid him any attention before old
man small mosque but now they began to
pay visits and sometimes they would drag
him in for question and always the same
question why did you name your daughter
your granddaughter jihad why do you keep
using the word jihad in your friday
sermons do you hate Americans what is
your connection bersama bin Laden so to
the Tunisian intelligence agencies and
organizations like it all over the Arab
world jihad equal extremism bin Laden&#39;s
definition had become institutionalized
that was the power of that word that he
was able to do and it filled the this
this old Imam it filled him with great
sadness he told me that off bin Laden&#39;s
many crimes this was in his mind one
that didn&#39;t get enough attention that he
took this word this beautiful idea he
didn&#39;t so much appropriate it as
kidnapped and debased it and corrupted
it and turned it into something that was
never meant to be and then persuaded all
of us that it always was a global jihad
but the good news is the good news is
that the global jihad is almost over
azman Laden defined it it was dying well
before he did and now it&#39;s on its last
legs opinion polls from all over the
Muslim world show that there is very
little interest among Muslims in a
global holy war against the West against
the the far enemy the supply of of young
men willing to fight and die for this
cause is dwindling supply of money just
as important more important perhaps a
supply of money to this activity is also
dwindling the
the wealthy fanatics who were previously
sponsoring this kind of activity are now
less generous what does that mean for us
in the West does it mean we can break
out the champagne wash our hands of it
disengage sleep easy at night no this
engagement is not an option because if
you let local jihad survive it becomes
international jihad and so there&#39;s now a
lot of different violent Jihad&#39;s all
over the world in Somalia in Mali in
Nigeria in in Iraq in Afghanistan
Pakistan their groups that claim to be
the inheritors of the legacy of Osama
bin Laden they use his rhetoric they
they even used the brand name he created
for his job so there is now an al-qaeda
in the islamic maghreb there&#39;s an
al-qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula there
is an al-qaeda in Mesopotamia there are
other groups in Nigeria Boko Haram in in
Somalia al-shabaab and they all pay
homage to Osama bin Laden but if you
look closely they are not fighting a
global jihad they&#39;re fighting battles
over much narrower issues usually it has
to do with ethnicity or race or
sectarianism or it&#39;s a power struggle
more often than not it&#39;s a power
struggle in one country or even a small
region within one country occasionally
they will go across the border from iraq
to syria from nigeria to a sorry from
mali to algeria from somalia to Kenya
but they are not fighting a global jihad
against some far enemy but that doesn&#39;t
mean that we can relax I was in Yemen
recently where it&#39;s the home of the last
al-qaeda franchise that still aspires to
attack America attack the West it&#39;s
old-school al-qaeda you may remember
that these guys they&#39;re the ones who try
to send the underwear bomber here and
they were using the internet to try
instigate violence among American
Muslims but they have been distracted
recently last year they took control
over a portion of southern Yemen and ran
it Taliban style and then the Yemeni
military got its act together and
ordinary people rose up against these
guys and drove them up and since then
most of their activities most of their
attacks have been directed at Yemenis so
I think we&#39;ve come to a point now where
we can say that just like all politics
all jihad is local but that&#39;s still not
reason for us to disengage because we&#39;ve
seen that movie before in Afghanistan
when those Mujahideen defeated the
Soviet Union we disengaged and even
before the fist had gone out of our
celebratory champagne the Taliban had
taken over in Kabul and we said local
jihad not our problem and then the
Taliban gave the keys of Kandahar to
Osama bin Laden he made it our problem
local jihad if you ignore it becomes
global jihad again a good news is that
it doesn&#39;t have to be we know how to
fight it now we have the tools we have
the know-how and we can take the lessons
we learned from the fight against global
jihad the victory against global jihad
and apply those to local jail what are
those lessons we know who killed bin
Laden SEAL Team six do we know do we
understand who killed bin Laden ISM who
ended the global jihad there lie the
answers to this to the solution to local
jail who killed bin Laden ism let&#39;s
start with bin Laden himself he probably
thought 911 was his greatest achievement
in reality it was the beginning of the
end for him he killed 3,000 innocent
people and that filled the Muslim world
with horror and revulsion and what that
meant was that his idea of jihad could
never become mainstream he condemned
himself to operating on the
Unitech fringes of his own community 911
didn&#39;t empower him it doomed who killed
bin Laden ISM abu musab zarqawi killed
him he was the especially sadistic head
of al-qaeda in Iraq who sent hundreds of
suicide bombers to attack non-americans
but Iraqis Muslims Sunni as well as
shiites any claim that al Qaeda had to
being protectors of Islam against the
Western Crusaders was drown in the blood
of Iraqi Muslims who killed osama bin
laden the SEAL Team six who killed bin
Laden ISM al Jazeera did al Jazeera and
half a dozen other satellite news
stations in Arabic because they
circumvented the old state-owned
television stations in a lot of these
countries which were designed to keep
information from people al Jazeera
brought information to them showed them
what was being said and done in the name
of their religion exposed the hypocrisy
of Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda and
allowed them gave them the information
that allowed them to come to their own
conclusions who killed bin Laden ISM the
arab spring day because it showed a way
for young muslims to bring about change
in a manner that osama bin laden with
his limited imagination could never have
conceived who defeated the global jihad
the american military did the american
soldiers did with their allies fighting
in faraway battle fields and perhaps a
time will come when they get the
rightful credit for so all these factors
and many more besides we don&#39;t even
fully understand some of them yet these
came together to defeat a monstrosity as
big as bin Laden ISM the global jihad
you needed this group effort now not all
of these things will work in local jihad
the American military is not going to
march into Nigeria to
on Boko Haram and it&#39;s unlikely that
seal team six will rappel into the homes
of Al Shabaab&#39;s leaders and take them
out but many of these other factors that
were in play are now even stronger than
before half the work is already done we
don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel the
notion of violent jihad in which more
Muslims are killed than any other kind
of people is already thoroughly
discredited we don&#39;t have to go back to
have satellite television and the
Internet are informing and empowering
young Muslims in exciting new ways and
the Arab Spring has produced governments
many of them Islamist government who
know that for their own
self-preservation they need to take on
the extremists in their midst we don&#39;t
need to persuade them we do need to help
them because they haven&#39;t really come to
this place before the good news again is
that a lot of the things they need we
already have and we are very good at
giving economic assistance not just
money but expertise technology know how
private investment fair terms of tre
medicine education technical support for
training for their police forces to
become more effective for their
anti-terror forces to become more
efficient we&#39;ve got plenty of these
things some of the other things that
they need we&#39;re not very good at giving
maybe nobody is time patience subtle tea
understanding these are harder to give I
live in New York now just this week
posters have gone up in subway stations
in New York that describe jihadis savage
but
in all the many years that I have
covered the Middle East I have never
been as optimistic as I am today that
the gap between the Muslim world and the
West is narrowing fast and one of the
many reasons for my optimism is that
because I know there are millions
hundreds of millions of people Muslims
like that old Imam in Tunis who are
reclaiming this word and restoring it to
its original beautiful purpose bin Laden
is dead bin Laden ISM has been defeated
his definition of jihad can now be
expunged but that jihad we can say
goodbye good riddance to the real jihad
we can say welcome back good luck thank
you
