this daily starts I was at a friend&#39;s
house and she had on her shelf a copy of
the DSM manual which is the manual of
mental disorders it lists every known
mental disorder and it used to be back
in the 50s a very slim pamphlet and then
it got bigger and bigger and bigger and
now it&#39;s 886 pages long and it lists
currently 374 mental disorders so I was
leafing through it wondering if I had
any mental disorders and it turns out
I&#39;ve got 12
I&#39;ve got generalized anxiety disorder
which is a given
I&#39;ve got nightmare disorder which is
categorized if you have recurrent dreams
of being pursued or declared to failure
and all my dreams involve people chasing
me down the street going you&#39;re a
failure
I&#39;ve got parent-child relation or
problems which I blame my parents for
I&#39;m kidding I&#39;m not kidding I&#39;m kidding
and I&#39;ve got malingering and I think
it&#39;s actually quite rare to have both
malingering and generalized anxiety
disorder because malingering tends to
make me feel very anxious anyway I was
looking through this book wondering if I
was much crazier than I thought I was or
maybe it&#39;s not a good idea to diagnose
yourself with a mental disorder if
you&#39;re not a trained professional
or maybe the psychiatry profession has a
kind of strange desire to label what&#39;s
essentially normal human behavior as a
mental disorder I didn&#39;t know which of
these things was true but I thought it
was kind of interesting and I thought
maybe I should meet a critic of
Psychiatry to get their view which is
how I ended up having lunch with the
Scientologists and it was a man called
Brian who runs a crack team of
Scientologists who were determined to
destroy psychiatry wherever it lies
there called the CCHR and I said to him
can I can you prove to me psychiatry is
a pseudoscience that can&#39;t be trusted
and I said yes we can prove it to you
and I said how and he said we can
introduce you to Tony and I said who&#39;s
Tony and he said Tony&#39;s in Broadmoor now
broad bor√•s Broadmoor Hospital it used
to be known as the
more asylum for the criminally insane
that&#39;s where they send that serial
killers and the people who can&#39;t help
themselves and I said too bad more what
to toady do but he said hardly anything
he beats someone up or something
and he decided to fake madness to get
out of a prison sentence but he faked it
too well and now he&#39;s stuck in Broadmoor
and nobody will believe he&#39;s sane do you
want us to try and get you into
Broadmoor to beat Tony so I said yes
please
so I got the train to Broadmoor I began
to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton
Park which about is what dogs also do
when anxious they yawn uncontrollably
and we got to learn more I got taken
through gate after gate after gate after
gate into the Wellness Center which is
where you get to meet the patients it
looks like a giant Hampton Inn it&#39;s all
beech and pine and calming colors in the
only bold colors are the Reds of the
panic buttons
and the patient started drifting in
and they were quite overweight and
wearing sweat pants and quite docile
looking and Brian the Scientologists
whispered to me that medicated which to
the Scientologists is not the worst evil
in the world but I&#39;m figured as from the
good idea and then Brian said here&#39;s
Tony and a man was walking in and he
wasn&#39;t overweight he was in very good
physical shape and he wasn&#39;t wearing
sweat pants he was wearing a pinstripe
suit and he had his arm outstretched
like someone on the apprentice he looked
like a man who wanted to wear an outfit
that would convince me that he was very
sane and he sat down and I said so is it
true that you faked UI in here and he
said yep yep absolutely I beat someone
up when I was 17 and I was in prison
awaiting trial and my cellmate said to
me you know we have to do fake madness
tell him you&#39;re mad you&#39;ll get sent to
some cushy hospital nurses or bring your
pizzas we love you on PlayStation so
what how did you do it so we&#39;ll ask to
see the prison psychiatrist and I just
seen a film called crash in which people
get sexual pleasure from crushing cars
into walls so I said to the psychiatrist
I get sexual pleasure from crushing cars
into walls and I said what else he said
oh yeah I told the psychiatrist that I
wanted to watch women as they died
because it would make me feel more
normal and I said where&#39;d you get out
from he&#39;s all from a biography of Ted
Bundy that they had to the prison
library anyway faked madness - well he
said and it didn&#39;t send him some cushy
hospital they sent him to Broadmoor and
the minute he got there said it one look
at the place asked to see the
psychiatrist said there&#39;s been a
terrible misunderstanding I&#39;m not
mentally ill I said how long have you
been here for he said well if I just
done my time in prison for the original
crime I&#39;d have got five years I&#39;ve been
in Broadmoor for 12 years Tony said that
it&#39;s a lot harder to convince people
you&#39;re sane than it is to convince him
you&#39;re crazy
he&#39;s I thought the best way to seem
normal would be to talk to people
normally about normal things like
football or what&#39;s on TV I subscribed to
New Scientist and recently had an
article about the US Army was trailing
bumblebees to sniff out explosives so I
said to a nurse did you know that the US
Army&#39;s joining bumblebees to sniff out
explosives when I read my medical notes
I saw they&#39;d written believes these can
sniff out explosives
he said you know they&#39;re always looking
out for non-verbal clues to my mental
state but how do you sit in a sane way
how do you cross your legs in the same
way it&#39;s just impossible
no one totally said that to me I thought
to myself am I sitting like a journalist
am i crossing my legs like a journalist
he said you know I&#39;ve got the Stockwell
strangler on one side of me and I&#39;ve got
the tiptoe through the tulips rapist on
the other side of me so I tend to stay
in my room a lot because I find them
quite frightening and they take Dad as a
sign of madness they say it proves that
I&#39;m aloof and grandiose so only in
Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out
with serial killers via side of madness
anyway seem completely normal to me but
what did I though what I&#39;ve got home I
emailed his punished and honestly made
and I said what&#39;s the story and he said
yep we accept that toady faked madness
to get out of a prison sentence because
his hallucinations that had seemed quite
cliched to begin with just vanished the
minute he got to Broadmoor however we
have assessed him and we&#39;ve determined
that what he is is a psychopath and in
fact faking madness is exactly the kind
of cunning and manipulative act of a
psychopath so on the checklist coming
manipulative so faking your brain going
wrong is evidence that your brain has
gone wrong and I spoke to other experts
and they said the pinstripe suit classic
psychopath speaks to items 1 and 2 on
the checklist glibness superficial charm
a grandiose sense of self-worth I said
well I said the one who hang out with
the the other patients classic
psychopathic speaks to grandiosity had
also lack of empathy so all the things
that has seemed most normal about Tony
was evidence according to his clinician
that he was mad in this new way he was a
psychopath and his clinician said to me
if you want to know more about
Psychopaths you can go on a psychopath
spotting course than by Robert hare who
invented the psychopathy checklist so I
did I went on a Psychopaths bottle
course and I am now a certified
and I have to say extremely adept
psychopath spotter so here&#39;s the
statistics one in a hundred regular
people is a psychopath so there&#39;s 1500
people in this room 15 of you are
psychopaths
although that figure rises to four
percent of CEOs and business leaders oh
I think there&#39;s a very good chance is
about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room
it could be carnage by the end of the
night has said the reason why is because
capitalism at its most ruthless rewards
psychopathic behavior the lack of
empathy the glibness
cunning manipulative in fact capitalism
perhaps at its most remorseless is a
physical manifestation of psychopathy
it&#39;s like a form of psychopathy that&#39;s
come down to affect us all the hair said
to me you know what forget about some
guy at Broadmoor who may or may not of
faked madness who cares that&#39;s not a big
story the big story he&#39;s at his
corporate psychopathy you want to go and
interview yourself some corporate
Psychopaths so I gave it a try wrote to
the Enron people I said could I covered
it for you and prison to find out if
your psychopaths and they didn&#39;t reply
so I changed tack I emailed chainsaw al
Dunlap the asset stripper from the 1990s
he would come into failing businesses
and close down 30% of the workforce just
turn American towns into ghost towns and
I emailed him and I said I believe you
may have a very special brain anomaly
that makes you special and interested in
the predatory spirit and fearless can I
come and interview you about your
special brain anomaly and he said come
on over so I went to our deluxe Grand
Florida mansion it was filled with
sculptures of predatory animals there
were lions and tigers he was taking me
through the garden there were fowl
Kern&#39;s and Eagles in the same to be over
they&#39;ve got sharks and what you say
missing that less effeminate way you&#39;ve
got more sharks and you&#39;ve got Tigers
was like Narnia
and then we went into his kitchen
now our Dunlap would be bought in to say
failing companies he closed down 30% of
the workforce and he quite often fire
people with a joke that for instance one
famous story about him somebody came up
to him and said I&#39;ve just bought myself
a new car and he said well you may have
a new car but I&#39;ll tell you what you
don&#39;t have a job so in his kitchen he
was standing there with his wife Judy
and his bodyguard Shourd and I said you
know how I said in my email that you
might have a special brain anomaly that
makes you special but he said he has an
amazing theory it&#39;s like Star Trek
you&#39;re going where no man has gone
before and I said well some
psychologists might say that this makes
you
daddy said what and I said it&#39;s like the
person I said I&#39;ve got a listed
psychopathic traits in my pocket can I
go through them with you
and he looked intrigued despite himself
but he said okay go on that&#39;s it okay
grandiose sense of self-worth which I
have to say would have been hard for him
to deny because he was standing
underneath a giant or your painting of
himself he said well you&#39;ve got to
believe in you and I said manipulative
he said that&#39;s leadership
and I said shallow effect an inability
to experience a range of emotions he
said who wants to be weighed down by
some nonsense emotions so he was going
down the psychopathy checklist basically
turning it into who moved my cheese
but I did notice something happening to
me that hours without Dunlap whenever he
said anything to me that was cut and
normal like he said no to juvenile
delinquency he said he got accepted into
West Point and they don&#39;t let
delinquents in West Point ease have no
too many short to marital relationships
he&#39;s only ever been married twice
admittedly his first wife cited him had
divorce papers but he wants threatened
her with a knife and said he always
wondered what human flesh tasted like
but people say stupid things to each
other in bad marriages in the heat of an
argument at his second marriage has
lasted 41 years so whenever he said
anything to me that just seemed kind of
non psychopathic I thought to myself
well I&#39;m not going to put bad in the
book and then I realized that becoming a
psychopath spotter had kind of turned me
a little bit psychopathic so I was
desperate to shove him in a box marked
psychopath I was desperate to define him
by his maddest edges and I realized oh
my god this is what I&#39;ve been doing for
20 years it&#39;s what all journalists do we
travel across the world with our
notepads in our hands and we wait for
the gems and the gems are always the
outermost aspects of our interviewees
personality we stitch them together like
medieval monks and we leave the normal
stuff on the floor and you know this is
a country that overdiagnosis certain
mental disorders hugely childhood
bipolar children as young as four are
being labeled bipolar because they have
temper tantrums which scores them high
on their bipolar checklist when I got
back to London
Tony phoned me
he said why don&#39;t you been returning my
calls I said why they say that you&#39;re a
psychopath and I said not a psychopath
said you know what one of the items on
the checklist is lack of remorse but
another item on the checklist is cutting
manipulative so when you say you feel
remorse for your crime they say typical
of the psychopaths to cunningly say he
feels remorse what he doesn&#39;t is like
witchcraft they turn everything upside
down he said I&#39;ve got a tribunal coming
up when you come to it so I said okay so
I went to his tribunal and after 14
years in Broadmoor let him go they
decided that he shouldn&#39;t be held
indefinitely because he scores high on a
checklist that might mean that he would
has a greater than average chance of
recidivism so they let him go and
outside in the corridor he said to me
you know what John everyone&#39;s a bit
psychopathic he said you are I am well
obviously I am I said what are you gonna
do now he said I&#39;m going to go to
Belgium because there&#39;s a woman there
that I fancy that she&#39;s married so I
would have to get a splitter from her
husband
anyway that was two years ago and that&#39;s
where my book ended and for the last 20
months everything was fine
nothing bad happened he was living with
a girl outside London he was according
to Brian the Scientologist making up for
lost time which I know sounds ominous
but isn&#39;t necessarily ominous
unfortunately after 20 months he did go
back to jail for a month he got into
Africa in a bar he called it and you&#39;re
going to jail for a month which I know
is bad but at least a month implies that
it&#39;s whatever the frak are wolves wasn&#39;t
too bad
and then he phoned me and you know what
I think it&#39;s right that Tony is out
because you shouldn&#39;t define people by
their maddest edges and what Tony is is
a
he&#39;s a semi psychopath he&#39;s a gray area
in a world that doesn&#39;t like grey areas
but the grey areas are where you find
the complexity
that&#39;s where you found the humanity
that&#39;s where you find the truth
and Tony said to me John
could I buy you a drink in the bath to
sort of thank you for everything you&#39;ve
done for me and I didn&#39;t go what would
you have done
thank you
