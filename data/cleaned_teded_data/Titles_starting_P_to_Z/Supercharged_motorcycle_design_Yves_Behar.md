the beginning of any collaboration
starts with a conversation and I would
like to to share with you that some of
the bits of the conversation that we
started with I grew up in a log cabin in
Washington State with too much time in
my hands and in scenic Switzerland for
me I always had a passion for
alternative vehicles this is a land
yacht racing across the desert in Nevada
combination of windsurfing and skiing
into this invention there and I also had
an interest in dangerous inventions this
is a hundred thousand volt Tesla coil
that I built in my my bedroom much to
the dismay of my mother to the dismay of
my mother this is dangerous
teenage fashion right there and I
brought this all together as passion
with alternative energy and raced a
solar car across Australia also the US
and Japan so wind power solar power we
had a lot to talk about we had a lot
that got us excited so we decided to do
a special project together to combine
engineering and design and really make a
fully integrated product something
beautiful we made a baby can you bring
out our baby
this baby is fully electric goes 150
miles an hour
it&#39;s a twice the range of any electric
motorcycle really the exciting thing
about a motorcycle is just the the
beautiful integration of engineering and
design it&#39;s got an amazing user
experience I was a wonderful working
with Yves Behar came up with our name
and logo we&#39;re mission motors and we&#39;ve
only got three minutes but we could talk
about it for hours thank you
Thank You Ted and thank you
