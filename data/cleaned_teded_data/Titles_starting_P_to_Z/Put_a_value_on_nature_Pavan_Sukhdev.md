I&#39;m here to talk to you about the
economic invisibility of nature the bad
news is that mother nature&#39;s back office
isn&#39;t quite working yet so those
invoices don&#39;t get issued but we need to
do something about this problem I began
my life as as a markets professional and
continued to take an interest but most
of my recent effort has been looking at
the value of what comes to human beings
from nature and which doesnt get priced
by markets a project called teeb was
started in 2007 and it was launched by a
group of environment ministers of the g8
plus 5 and their basic inspiration was a
stern review of lord stern they asked
themselves a question if economics could
make such a convincing case for early
action on climate change well why can&#39;t
the same be done for conservation why
can&#39;t an equivalent case be made for
nature and the answer is yeah it can but
it&#39;s not that straightforward
biodiversity the living fabric of this
planet is not a gas it exists in many
layers ecosystem species and genes
across many scales international
national local community and doing for
nature what Lord stern and esteemed it
for climate is not that easy and yet we
began we began the project with an
interim report which quickly pulled
together a lot of information that had
been collected on the subject by many
many researchers and amongst our
compiled the results was the startling
revelation that in fact we were losing
natural capital the benefits that flow
from nature to us we were losing it at
an extraordinary rate in fact of the
order of 2 to 4 trillion dollars worth
of natural capital this came out in 2008
which was of course around the time that
the banking crisis had shown that we had
lost financial capital of the order of
two and a half trillion dollars so this
was comparable in size to that kind of
loss we then have gone on since to
present for international community for
months for local governments and for
businesses and for people for you and me
a whole slew of reports which were
presented at the UN last year which
address the economic invisibility of
nature and describe what can be done to
solve it what is this about a picture
that you&#39;re familiar with the Amazon
rainforest it&#39;s a massive store of
carbon it&#39;s an amazing store of
biodiversity but what people don&#39;t
really know is this also it&#39;s rain
factory because the northeastern trade
winds as they go over the Amazonas
effectively gather in the water vapor
something like 20 billion tons per day
or water vapor is sucked up by the
northeastern trade winds and eventually
precipitates in the form of rain across
the La Plata Basin this rainfall cycle
this rainfall factory effectively feeds
an agricultural economy of the order of
240 billion dollars worth in Latin
America but the question arises okay so
how much and do Uruguay Paraguay
Argentina and indeed the state of mato
grosso in Brazil pay for that vital
input to that economy to the state of
amazonas which produces that rainfall
and the answer is zilch exactly zero
that&#39;s the economic invisibility of
nature that can&#39;t keep going on because
economic incentives and disincentives
are very powerful economics has become
the currency of policy and unless we
address this invisibility we are going
to get the results that we are seeing
which is a gradual degradation and loss
of this valuable natural asset it&#39;s not
just about the amazonas or indeed about
rainforest no matter what level you look
at whether it&#39;s at the ecosystem level
or at the species level or the genetic
level we see the same problem again and
again so rainfall cycle and water
regulation by rainforest at an ecosystem
level at the species level it&#39;s been
estimated that insect based pollination
bees pollinating fruit and so on is
something like 190 billion dollars worth
that&#39;s something like an eight percent
of the total agricultural output
globally completely passes below the
radar screen when did Abby actually ever
give you an invoice for that matter if
you look at the genetic level sixty
percent of medicines were prospected
will found first as Moloch
use in a rainforest or arif once again
most of that doesn&#39;t get paid and that
brings me to another aspect of this
which is to whom should this get paid
that genetic material probably belonged
if it could belong to anyone to a local
community of poor people who parted with
the knowledge that helped the
researchers to find the molecule which
then became the medicine they were the
ones that didn&#39;t get paid and if you
look at the species level you saw about
fish today the depletion of ocean
fisheries is so significant that
effectively it is affecting the ability
of the poor the artisanal fisher folk
and those who fish for their own
livelihoods to feed their families
something like a billion people depend
on fish the quantity of fish in the
oceans a billion people depend on fish
for their main source for animal protein
and at this rate at which we are losing
fish it is a human problem of enormous
dimensions a health problem of a kind
that we haven&#39;t seen before and finally
at the ecosystem level whether it&#39;s
flood prevention or drought control
provided by the forests or whether it is
the ability of poor farmers to go out
and gather leaf litter for their cattle
and goats so whether it&#39;s the ability of
their wives to go in and collect fuel
wood from the forest it is actually the
poor who depend most on these ecosystem
services we did estimates in our in our
study that for countries like Brazil
India and Indonesia even though
ecosystem services these benefits that
flow from nature&#39;s to humanity for free
they&#39;re not very big in percentage terms
of GDP two four eight ten fifteen
percent but in these countries if we
measure how much they&#39;re worth to the
poor the answers are more like
forty-five percent seventy-five percent
ninety percent that&#39;s the difference
because these are important benefits for
the poor and you can&#39;t really have a
proper model for development if at the
same time you are destroying or allowing
the degradation of the very asset the
most important asset which is your
development asset that is ecological
infrastructure how bad can things get
well here&#39;s a picture of something
called the mean species abundance it&#39;s
basically a measure of how many Tigers
toad sticks or whatever on average of
biomass of various species around the
green represents the percentage if it&#39;s
dark green it&#39;s like 80 to 100
and if it&#39;s yellow it&#39;s forty to sixty
percent and these are percentages versus
the original state so to speak the pre
industrial area 1750 I&#39;m going to show
you how business as usual will affect
this and just watch the change in colors
in India China Europe sub-saharan Africa
as we move on and consume global biomass
at a rate which is actually not going to
be able to sustain us see that again the
only places that remain green and that&#39;s
not good news is in fact places like the
Gobi Desert like the tundra and like
Sahara that doesn&#39;t help because there
were very few species and volume of
biomass there in the first place this is
the challenge the reason this is
happening boils down in my mind to one
basic problem which is our inability to
perceive the difference between public
benefits and private profits we tend to
constantly ignore public wealth simply
because it is in the Commonwealth it&#39;s
it&#39;s common goods and here&#39;s an example
from Thailand where we found that
because the value of a mangrove is not
that much it&#39;s about six hundred dollars
over the life of nine years that this
has been measured compared to its value
as a shrimp farm which is the more like
nine thousand six hundred dollars there
has been a gradual trend to deplete the
mangroves and convert them to shrimp
farms but of course if you look at what
exactly those profits are almost eight
thousand of those dollars are in fact
subsidies so you compare the two sides
of the coin and you find that it&#39;s more
like 1200 versus 600 that&#39;s not that hot
but on the other hand if you start
measuring how much would it actually
cost to restore the land of the shrimp
farm back to productive use once salt
deposition in chemical deposition has
actually had its effects that answer is
low like twelve thousand dollars of
course and if you see the benefits of
the mangrove in terms of the storm
protection and cyclone protection that
you get and in terms of the fisheries
the nurse fish in nurseries that provide
fish for the poor that answer is more
like eleven thousand dollars so now look
at the different lens if you look at the
lens of public wealth as against the
lens of private profits you get a
completely different answer which is
clearly conservation makes more sense
and not destruction
so is this just a story from South talin
sorry this is a global story and here&#39;s
what the same calculation looks like
which was done recently well I see
recency over the last 10 years by a
group called true cost and they
calculated for the top three thousand
corporations what are the externalities
in other words what are the costs of
doing business as usual this is not
illegal stuff this is basically business
as usual which causes climate changing
emissions which have an economic cost it
causes pollutants being issued which
have an economic cost health costs and
so on use of fresh water if you drill
water to make coke near the village farm
that&#39;s not illegal but yes it costs the
community can we stop this and how I
think the first point to make is that we
need to recognize natural capital
basically the stuff of life is natural
capital and we need to recognize that
and build that into our systems when we
measure GDP as a measure of economic
performance at the national level we
don&#39;t include our biggest asset at the
country level when we measure corporate
performances we don&#39;t include our
impacts on nature and on what our
business costs society that has to stop
in fact this was what really inspired my
interest in this space I began a project
way back called the green accounting
project that was in the in early 2000
when India was going gung-ho about GDP
growth as the means forward looking at
China with its stellar growths of eight
nine ten percent and wondering why can&#39;t
we do the same and a few friends of mine
and I decided this doesn&#39;t make sense
this is going to create more cost to
society and more losses so we decided to
do a massive set of calculations and
started producing green accounts were in
the United States that&#39;s how my interest
began and went to the team project
calculating this at the national level
is one thing and it has begun and the
World Bank has acknowledged this and
they&#39;ve started the project called waves
wealth accounting and valuation of
ecosystem services but calculating this
at the next level that means at the sec
that the business sector level is
important and actually we&#39;ve done this
with the T project we&#39;ve done this for a
very difficult case which was for
deforestation in China this is important
because in China in 1997 the Yellow
River actually went dry for nine months
causing severe loss of agricultural
output and pain and loss to society just
a year later the Yangtze flooded causing
something like five thousand five
hundred deaths so clearly there was a
problem with deforestation it was
associated largely with the construct
industry and the Chinese government
responded sensibly and placed the ban on
felling but retrospective on 40 years
shows that if we had accounted for these
costs the costs of loss of topsoil the
cost of loss of waterways the lost
productivity the loss to local
communities as a result of all these
factors desertification and so on those
costs are almost twice as much as the
market price of timber so in fact the
price of timber in the raging
marketplace or to have been three times
what it was had it reflected the true
pain and the cost to the society within
China of course after the event one can
be wise the way to do this is to do it
on a company basis to take leadership
forward and to do it for as many
important sectors which have a cost and
to disclose these answers someone wants
to ask me who is better or worse is it
Unilever as a PNG when it comes to their
impact on rainforests in Indonesia and I
couldn&#39;t answer because neither of these
companies good do they are and
professionals or they are do not
calculate or disclose their
externalities but if we look at
companies like Puma York incites their
CEO and chairman once challenged we had
a function saying that he&#39;s going to
implement my project before I finish it
well I think we kind of did it at the
same time but he&#39;s done it he&#39;s
basically worked out the cost to Puma
Puma has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover
three hundred million dollars of profits
two hundred million dollars after tax 94
million dollars of externalities costs
to business now that&#39;s not a happy
situation for them but they have the
confidence and the courage to come
forward and say here&#39;s what we are
measuring we are measuring it because we
know that you cannot manage what you do
not measure that&#39;s an example I think
for us to look at and for us to draw
comfort from if more companies did this
and if more sectors engage this has
sectors you could have analysts business
analyst and you could have people like
us and consumers and NGOs actually look
and compare the social performance of
companies today we can&#39;t yet do that but
i think the path is laid out this can be
done and i&#39;m delighted that the
institute of chartered accountants in
the UK has already set up a coalition to
do this an international coalition the
other favorite if you like solution for
me is the creation of green carbon
markets and by the way these are my
favorites externalities calculation and
green carbon markets teeb has more than
it doesn&#39;t separate groups of solutions
including protected area valuation and
payments for ecosystem services and eco
certification and you name it but these
are the favorites what&#39;s green carbon
today what we have is basically a brown
carbon market place it&#39;s about energy
emissions the European Union ETS is the
main marketplace it&#39;s not doing too well
we&#39;ve over issued a bit like inflation
you over issue currency you get what you
see the declining prices but that&#39;s all
about energy and industry but what we
are missing out is also some other
emissions like black carbon that is suit
what we&#39;re also missing is blue carbon
which by the way is the largest tour of
carbon more than fifty five percent
thankfully the flux in other words the
flow of emissions from the ocean to the
atmosphere and vice versa is more or
less balanced in fact what&#39;s being
absorbed is something like 25 or percent
of our emissions which then leads to
acidification or lower alkalinity in
oceans more of that in a minute and
finally there&#39;s deforestation and
there&#39;s emission of methane from
agriculture green carbon which is the
deforestation and agricultural emissions
and blue carbon together comprise
twenty-five percent of our emissions we
have the means already in our hands
through a structure through a mechanism
called red plus a scheme for the reduced
emissions from deforestation and forest
degradation and already no way has
contributed a billion dollars each
towards Indonesia and Brazil to
implement this Red Cross game so we
actually have some movement forward but
the thing is to do a lot more of that
will this solve the problem will
economic solve everything well I&#39;m
afraid not there is an area that is the
oceans coral reefs as you can see they
cut across the entire globe all the way
from Micronesia across Indonesia
Malaysia India Madagascar and to the
rest of the Caribbean these red dots
these red areas basically provide the
food and livelihood for more than half a
billion people so that&#39;s almost an
eighth of society and the sad thing is
that as these color reefs are lost and
scientists tell us that any level of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above
350 parts per million is too dangerous
for the survival of these reefs we are
not only risking the extinction of the
entire coral species the warm water
corals we are not only risking
fourth of all fish species which are in
the oceans but we are risking the very
lives and livelihoods of more than 500
million people who live in the
developing world in poor countries so in
selecting targets of 450 parts per
million and selecting two degrees at the
climate negotiations what we have done
is we&#39;ve made an ethical choice we&#39;ve
actually kind of made an ethical choice
in society to not have coral reefs well
what I would say to you in parting is
that we may have done that let&#39;s think
about it and what it means but please
let&#39;s not do more of that because mother
nature only has that much in ecological
infrastructure and that much natural
capital I don&#39;t think we can afford too
much of such ethical choices thank
you
