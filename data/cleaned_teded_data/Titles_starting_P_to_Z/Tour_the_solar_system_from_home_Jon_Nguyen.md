as a kid I was fascinated with all
things air and space I would watch Nova
on PBS our school would show Bill Nye
the Science Guy when I was when I was in
elementary school my next-door neighbor
he gave me a book for my birthday it was
an astronomy book and I pored over that
thing for hours on end and it was a
combination of all these things that
inspired me to pursue space exploration
as my own personal dream and part of
that dream was I always wanted to just
fly around the solar system and visit
different planets and visit moons and
spacecraft well a number of years later
I graduated from UCLA and I found myself
at NASA working for the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and there our team was
challenged to create a 3d visualization
of the solar system and today I want to
show you what we&#39;ve done so far now the
kicker is everything I&#39;m about to do
here you can do at home because we built
this for the public for you guys to use
so what you&#39;re looking at right now is
the earth you can see United States and
California and San Diego and you can use
the mouse or the keyboard to spend
things around now this isn&#39;t new anyone
who&#39;s used Google Earth has seen this
before but one thing we like to say in
our group is we do the opposite of
Google Earth Google Earth goes from this
view down to your backyard we go from
this view out to the Stars so the earth
is cool but what we really want to show
how the spacecraft so I&#39;m gonna bring
the interface back up and now you&#39;re
looking at a number of satellites
orbiting the Earth these are a number of
our science base earth orbiters we
haven&#39;t included military satellites and
weather satellites and communication
satellites or reconnaissance satellites
if we did it would be a complete mess
because there&#39;s a lot of stuff out there
and the cool thing is we actually
created 3d models for a number of these
spacecraft so if you want to visit any
of these all you need to do is double
click on them so I&#39;m gonna find
the International Space Station
double-click and it&#39;ll take us all the
way down to the ISS and now you&#39;re
riding along with the ISS where it is
right now and the other cool thing is
not only can we move the camera around
we can also control time so I can slide
this jog dial here to shuttle time
forward and now we can see what a sunset
on the ISS would look like and they get
one every 90 minutes all right so what
about the rest of it well I can click on
this home button over here and that&#39;ll
take us up to the inner solar system and
now we&#39;re looking at the rest of the
solar system you can see there&#39;s Saturn
Jupiter and while we&#39;re here I want to
point out something it&#39;s actually pretty
busy here we have the Mars Science
Laboratory on its way to Mars just
launched last weekend here we have Juno
on its cruise to Jupiter there we have
Don orbiting Vesta and we have over here
a New Horizons I&#39;m a straight shot to
Pluto and I mentioned this because this
is a strange public perception that NASA
is dead that the Space Shuttle stopped
flying and all of a sudden there&#39;s no
more spacecraft out there well a lot of
what NASA does is robotic exploration
and we have a lot of spacecraft out
there granted we&#39;re not sending humans
up at the moment well at least with
their owns with their own launch
vehicles but NASA is far from dead and
one of the reasons why we write a
program like this is that people realize
that there&#39;s so many other things that
we&#39;re doing anyway while we&#39;re here
again if you want to visit anything all
you need to do is double click so I&#39;m
just going to double click on Vesta and
here we have Don orbiting Vesta and this
is happening right now I&#39;m going to
double click on Uranus and we can see
Uranus rotating on its side along with
its moons you can see how it&#39;s tilted
about 989 degrees and just being able to
visit different places and go through
different times we have data from 1950
to 25th
the grant thing we don&#39;t have everything
in between because some of the data is
hard to get just being able to visit
places in different times you can
explore everything you can explore this
for hours literally hours on end but I
want to show you one thing in particular
so I&#39;m going to open up the destination
tab spacecraft outer planet missions
Voyager 1 and I&#39;m gonna bring up the
Titan flyby so now we&#39;ve gone back in
time we&#39;re now riding along with Voyager
1 the date here is November 11th 1980
there&#39;s a funny thing going on here it
doesn&#39;t look like anything&#39;s going on
it looks like I&#39;ve paused the program
it&#39;s actually running at real rate right
now 1 second per second and in fact
Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I
think it&#39;s 38,000 miles per hour it only
looks like nothing&#39;s moving because well
Saturn here is 700 thousand miles away
and Titan here is four to five thousand
miles away it&#39;s just the vastness of
space makes it look like nothing&#39;s
happening but to make it more
interesting I&#39;m gonna speed up time and
we can watch as Voyager one flies by
Titan which is a hazy moon of Saturn it
actually has a very thick atmosphere and
I&#39;m gonna recenter the camera on Saturn
here I&#39;m gonna pull out and I want to
show you
Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn but
there&#39;s a point to be major with the 3d
visualization like this we cannot only
just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn
there&#39;s a whole story to tell here it
even better because it&#39;s an interactive
application you can tell the story for
yourself if you want to pause it you can
pause it if you want to keep going if
you want to change the camera or you can
do that and because of that I can show
you that Voyager 1 doesn&#39;t just fly by
Saturn it actually flies underneath
Saturn
now what happens is as it flies
underneath Saturn suddenly grabs it
gravitationally and flings it up and out
of the solar system so if I just keep
letting this go you can see Voyager 1
fly up like that and in fact I&#39;m gonna
go back to the solar system I&#39;m going to
go back to today now and I want to show
you where Voyager 1 is right there above
way above the solar system way beyond
our solar system and here&#39;s a thing now
you know how it got there now you know
why and to me that&#39;s the point of this
program you can manipulate it yourself
you can fly around yourself and you can
learn for yourself let you know the
theme today is the world in your grasp
well we&#39;re trying to give you the solar
system in your grasp and we hope once
it&#39;s there you&#39;ll be able to learn for
yourself what we&#39;ve done out there and
what we&#39;re about to do and my personal
dream is for kids to take this and
explore and see the wonders out there
and be inspired as I was as a kid to
pursue STEM education and to pursue a
dream in space exploration thank you
