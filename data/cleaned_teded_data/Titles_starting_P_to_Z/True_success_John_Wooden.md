I coined my own definite definition of
success in 1934 when I was teaching at a
high school in South Bend Indiana being
a little bit disappointed and delusioned
perhaps by the way parents of the
youngsters in my English classes
expected their youngsters to get an A or
B they thought a C was alright for the
neighbors children because the neighbors
children all average but they weren&#39;t
satisfied by their own would make the
teacher feel that they had failed or the
youngsters failed and that&#39;s not right
the good Lord and His infinite wisdom
didn&#39;t create us all equal as far as
intelligent concerned any more than we
could for size appearance not everybody
could earn an A or B and I didn&#39;t like
that way of judging and and I did know
how the alumni of various schools back
in the 30s judged
coaches and athletic teams if you won
them all and you were considered to be
reasonably successful not completely
because I found out we had a number of
years of UCLA where we did it was a game
but it seemed that we didn&#39;t win each
individual game with the margin the some
of our alumni had predicted and quite
frequently I
quite frequently I really felt that they
had backed up their predictions in a
more materialistic manner but I was true
back in their 30s so I understood that
so but I didn&#39;t like it I didn&#39;t agree
with it and I wanted to come up with
something that I hope could make me a
better teacher and give the youngsters
under my supervision whether it be in
athletics or in the English classroom
something which to aspire other than
just a higher mark in the classroom or
more points in some athletic contests
and I thought about that for quite a
spell and I wanted to come up with my
own definition I thought that might help
and I knew how mr. Webster defined it as
the accumulation of material possessions
or the attainment of position of power
prestige or something of that sort
worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my
opinion not necessarily indicative of
success so I want to come up something
of my own and I recall that I was raised
on a small farm in southern Indiana and
dad tried to teach me of my brothers
that you should never try to be better
than someone else I&#39;m sure at the time
he did that I didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t well
somewhere I guess in the hidden recesses
of mind it popped out years later never
tried to be better than someone else
always learned from others and never
cease trying to be the best you could be
that&#39;s under your control and if you get
too engrossed involved and concerned in
regard to the things over which you have
no control it will adversely affect the
things over which you have control then
I ran across a simple verse that said at
God&#39;s footstool to confess the poor soul
knelt and bowed his head I failed he
cried the master said now didst I best
that is success from those things and
one other perhaps I coined my own
definition of success which is peace of
mind attained only through self
satisfaction in knowing you made the
effort to do the best of which you&#39;re
capable I believe that&#39;s true if you
make the effort do the best and put your
cape on trying to improve the situation
that exists for you I think that&#39;s
success and I don&#39;t think others can
judge that I think it&#39;s like character
and reputation your reputation is what
you&#39;re perceived to be your character is
what you really are and I think the
character is much more important than
what you are perceived to be and hope
north be good but they don&#39;t necessarily
be the same well that was my idea that
what I was going to try to get across to
the youngsters I ran across other things
I love to teach and he was mentioned by
the previous speaker that that I enjoyed
poetry and I devil in it a bit in love
and there are some things that help me
and he be better than it would have been
I know no one ought to be you know what
it should be but I think I&#39;m better than
it would have been if I hadn&#39;t run
across certain things and one was it
just a little verse that said no no
written word no spoken plea can teach
our youth what they should be nor all
the books on all the shelves is what the
teachers are themselves that made an
impression on me in the 1930s in and I
tried to use that more or less in my
teaching whether it be in sports or
whether it be getting the English
classroom and I I love poetry and all we
had an interest in that and somehow and
maybe it&#39;s because Dad and used to read
to us at night the coal oil lamp we
didn&#39;t have electricity in our farm home
and they had to read poetry to us so I
always liked it and about the same time
that I ran across this one verse I ran
across another one that someone asked a
lady teacher why she taught and she
after some time she said she want to
think about that then she came up and
said they asked me why I teach and I
reply where could I find such splendid
company there sits a statesman strong
unbiased wise another leader Webster
silver-tongued a doctor sits beside him
whose quick steady hand may mend a bone
or stem the life Bloods flow and there a
builder couple drives the arch of that
church she builds within that Minister
may speak the Word of God and lead
assembling school to touch the Christ
and all about a gathering of teachers
farmers Merchants labors those who work
on voting build and plan and pray and
praying to a great tomorrow and let me
say I may not see the church or hear the
word or eat the food their hands make
aroma yet again I may and later I may
say I knew him once and he was weak or
strong or bold
proud or gay I knew him once but then he
was a boy they asked me why I teach and
I reply where could I find such splendid
company and I believe the teaching
profession that&#39;s true you have so many
youngsters and I gotta think my
youngsters UCLA 30 some attorneys 11
dentist in doctors have many many
teachers and in other professions and
that gives you a great deal of pleasure
to see them go on I always tried to make
the youngsters feel that they&#39;re there
to get an education number one
basketball the second was it playing
their way and they do need a little time
for social activities but you let social
activities take a little precedence over
the other two and you&#39;re not going to
have any very long so that was the ideas
that I tried to get across to the
youngsters under my supervision
I had three rules pretty much that I
stuck with practically all the time I&#39;d
learned these prior to coming to UCLA
and I decided they were very important
one was never be late never be late
later on I had I said certain things
that I had the players if we&#39;re leaving
to someone they had to be neat and clean
there was a time when I
I made them wear jackets and shirts and
ties but then I saw our Chancellor
coming school and longer in the denims
and and turtlenecks and I thought it was
not right for me to keep this other so I
let him just add to be neat and clean
and I had one of my one of my greatest
players that you probably heard of Bill
Walton he came and gets the bus who were
leaving for somewhere and play and he
wasn&#39;t clean neat so I I would let him
go he couldn&#39;t get on the bus he had to
go home and and and get cleaned up to
get to the airport to forget so I was a
stickler for that I believed in that I
believe in time very important I believe
you should be on time but I felt a
practice for example we start on time we
close on time the youngsters didn&#39;t have
to feel that we&#39;re going to keep them
over when I speak in coaching clinics I
often tell young coaches in the coaching
clinics more less there&#39;ll be the
younger coaches getting in and the
profession that and most of our young
you know and probably newly married
and I tell them don&#39;t run practices late
because you&#39;ll go home in a bad mood and
then that&#39;s not good for a young married
man to go home in a bad mood when you
get older when you get older to make a
difference but so I did believe on time
I believe starting on time not believe
closing on time and another one I had
was not one word to profanity one word
to profanity and you you out of here for
the day if I see it in a game you&#39;re
going to come out and sit on the bench
and the third one was never criticize a
teammate I didn&#39;t want that I used tell
him I was paid to do that that&#39;s my job
I&#39;m paid to do it pitifully poor but I
am paid to do not like the coaches today
for gracious sakes know they&#39;re in there
it&#39;s a little different than it was in
my day but those are three things that I
stuck with pretty closely all the time
and those actually came from my dad and
that&#39;s what he tried to teach you me and
my brothers at one time I came up with a
pyramid eventually that I&#39;m not going to
do I have the time to go on that but up
that to help me I think become a better
teacher and this is something like this
and I had blocks in the period and the
cornerstones being industrious and
enthusiasm working hard and enjoying
what you&#39;re doing coming up to the apex
according to my definition of success
and right into the top faith in patience
and I say to you and whatever in doing
you must be patient you have to have
patience too we want things to happen to
what we talk about our youth being
impatient a lot and they are they won&#39;t
change everything they think I&#39;ll change
this progress and we get a little older
we&#39;re sort of let things go and we
forget that there is no progress without
change so you must have patience and I
believe that we must have faith I
believe that we must believe really
believe now Jesus not just give a word
service believe that things will work
out as they should
providing we do what we should I think
our tendency has to hope that things
will turn out the way we want them to so
much of the time but we don&#39;t do the
things that are necessary to make those
things become reality
I&#39;ve worked on this for some 14 years
and I think it helped me become a better
teacher but it all involved around that
original definition of success you know
a number of years ago there was a major
league baseball umpire by the name of
George Moriarty and he spelt Moriarty
with only one eye has that I&#39;ve never
seen that before but he did and big big
baseball players there they&#39;re very
perceptive about those things and they
noticed he had only one eye and his name
and you&#39;d be surprised how many also
told him that Devin&#39;s one more than his
head at various times now but he wrote
something that I think he did what I
tried to do in this pyramid he called it
the road ahead or the road behind and he
said sometimes I think the fates must
grin as we denounce them and insist the
only reason we can&#39;t win is the face
themselves amidst yet their lives on the
ancient claim we win or lose within
ourselves the shining trophies on
ourselves can never win tomorrow&#39;s game
you and I know deeper down there&#39;s
always a chance to win the crown but
when we fail to give our best we simply
haven&#39;t met the test of giving all and
saving none until the game is really won
I&#39;m showing what is meant by grit are
playing through another&#39;s quip I&#39;m
playing through not letting up it&#39;s
bearing down that wins the cap now
dreaming there&#39;s a goal ahead of hoping
when our dreams are dead our praying
when our hopes are fled yet losing it&#39;s
not afraid to fall
if bravery we have given all for who can
ask more of a man than giving all within
his span giving all it seems to me is
not so far from victory
and so the facer seldom wrong no matter
how they twist and whine it&#39;s you and I
who make our fates we open up or close
the gates on the road ahead near the
road behind reminds me of another set of
threes that my dad tried to get across
just no wine don&#39;t complain don&#39;t make
excuses you get out there and whatever
you do and do it the best you&#39;re
building
no one can do more than that I tried to
get across to that my punish don&#39;t tell
you never heard me mention winning never
mention winning my idea is that you can
lose when you outscore somebody in a
game and you can win when you&#39;re
outscored I&#39;ve felt that way on certain
occasions
various times and I just wanted to be
able to be able to hold their head up
after a game I guess is saying that when
when a game is over and you see somebody
they didn&#39;t know the outcome I hope they
couldn&#39;t tell by your actions whether
you are scored an important about
pointed out score jus and that&#39;s what
really matters if you make your effort
to do the best you can regularly there
is also being about what they should to
be not necessarily what you would want
them to be but they&#39;ll be about what
they should and only you will know
whether you can do that and that&#39;s what
I wanted from them more than anything
else and as time went by and I learned
more about other things I think it
worked a little better as far as the
results but I want to thank the score of
a game to me the byproduct of these
other things and not be in themself I
believe it was and one great philosopher
said no I know there&#39;s Cervantes serve
and he said the journey is better than
the end and and I like that I think that
is yeah it&#39;s getting there sometimes
when you get there that&#39;s almost self
that down but it&#39;s getting there that&#39;s
the fun I like to as the basketball
coach you usually I liked our practices
to be the journey and that the game
would be the end the end result I&#39;d like
to have a sit in the stands and then
watch the players play and see whether
I&#39;d done a decent job during the week on
there again it&#39;s getting the players to
get that self-satisfaction knowing that
they&#39;ve made the effort to do the best
job of which they are capable sometimes
I&#39;m asked who is the best player I had
over the best teams I can never answer
that as far as the individual to
concerned I like to I was asked one time
about that I said suppose that you in
some way could could make the perfect
player what would you want and I said
well I&#39;d want one knew why he was a UCLA
and to get an education there was a good
student really knew why he was there in
the first place
but I want when they can play - I don&#39;t
want to realize that the defense usually
wins championships and will work hard on
defense and but I&#39;d want one to play
offense - I won&#39;t even to be unselfish
and and we look for the pass first and
not shoot all time and I don&#39;t run the
could pass and would pass I&#39;ve had some
that I&#39;ve had some that could and
wouldn&#39;t and I&#39;ve had some that wouldn&#39;t
could you say you couldn&#39;t tell your
challenge so I&#39;m on that and I wanted
him to be able to shoot from the outside
and I want to be able to be good inside
- I don&#39;t want to be able to be able to
rebound well at both ends - and why not
just take someone like Keith Wilkes and
let it go at that
he had the qualifications and not the
only one but he was one that I used in
that particular category because I think
he he made the effort to become the best
every couple I mentioned in my book they
call me coach to players that gave me
great satisfaction that came as closest
I think anyone I ever had to reach their
full potential one was Conrad Burke and
one was Doug Macintosh when I saw them
as freshmen on our Freshman team we
didn&#39;t have freshmen couldn&#39;t play
varsity when I got I thought and I
thought oh gracious if these two players
either one of them they&#39;re different
years but I thought about each one of
the time he was there who he ever makes
the bark at varsity
our varsity must be pretty miserable if
he&#39;s good to make her good enough to
make it and you know one of them was a
starting player for a season and a half
and the other was up his next year he
played 32 minutes and national
championship game did a tremendous for
us and the next year he was a starting
starting player on national championship
team and here I thought you&#39;d never play
a minute what it was so those are the
things that that give you a great joy
and great satisfaction to see one
neither one of those youngsters could
shoot very well but they had outstanding
shooting percentages because he didn&#39;t
didn&#39;t force it and you know one could
jump very well but they got kept good
position and so they did well rebounding
they remembered that that every shot was
taken they assumed it&#39;d be missed I&#39;ve
had two men that stand around wait to
see if it&#39;s missed then they
once you late somebody else is in there
hit him and they weren&#39;t very quick but
they put a good petition kept in good
balance and so they they pretty pretty
good defense for us so they had
qualities that they came close to as
close to reaching possibly their full
potential as any players I ever had so I
consider them as to be as successful as
a as a Lewis Alcindor or a Bill Walton
or in many of the others that we had
there was somehow standing up
outstanding players have I rambled
enough I heard that when he makes his
appearance I supposed shut up
