we&#39;re going to go on and dive to the
deep sea and anyone that&#39;s pad that
lovely opportunity knows that for about
two-and-a-half hours on the way down
it&#39;s a perfectly positively pitch-black
world and we used to see the most
mysterious animals out the window that
you couldn&#39;t describe these blinking
lights a world of bioluminescence like
fireflies dr. Edith Witter she&#39;s now at
the ocean research and conservation
Association was able to come up with a
camera that could capture some of these
incredible animals and that&#39;s what
you&#39;re seeing here on the screen
that&#39;s all bioluminescence like I said
just like fireflies
there&#39;s a flying turkey under a tree I
don&#39;t geologist by training but I love
that and you see some of the some of the
bioluminescence they used to avoid being
eaten some they used to attract prey but
all of it from an artistic point of view
is just positively amazing and a lot of
what goes on inside there&#39;s a fish with
glowing eyes pulsating eyes some some of
the colors are designed to hypnotize
these lovely patterns and then this last
one one of my favorites is pinwheel
design just absolutely amazing every
single dive that&#39;s the unknown world and
today we&#39;ve only explored about 3
percent 3 percent of what&#39;s out in the
ocean already we found the world&#39;s
highest mountains world&#39;s deepest
valleys underwater Lakes underwater
waterfalls a lot of that we shared with
you from the stage and in a place where
we thought no life at all we find more
life we think and diversity and density
than the tropical rainforest which tells
us that we don&#39;t know much about this
planet at all there&#39;s still 97% and
neither that 97% is empty or just full
of surprises but I want to jump up to
shallow water now and look at some
creatures that are positively amazing
the cephalopods head foot as a kid I
knew them as calamari mostly foot this
is an octopus this is a work of dr.
Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological
lab and just fascinating how cephalopods
can with their eyes incredible eyes
sense their surrounding look at light
look at patterns here&#39;s an octopus
moving across the reef finds a spot to
settle down curls up and then disappears
into the background tough thing to do
in the next bit we&#39;re going to see a
couple squid these are squid now males
when they fight if they&#39;re really
aggressive they turn white and these two
males are fighting they do it by
bouncing their butts together which is
an interesting concept now here&#39;s a male
on the left to the female on the right
and now the male has managed to split
his color a coloration so the female
only always sees the kinder gentler
squid in him and the male&#39;s of yeah okay
we&#39;re going to see it again let&#39;s take a
look at it again watch the coloration
white on the right brown on the left he
takes a step back so he&#39;s keeping off
the other males by splitting his body
and comes up on the other side bingo I&#39;m
told that&#39;s not just a squid phenomenon
with males but I don&#39;t know that&#39;s it
cuttlefish I love cuttlefish this is a
giant Australian cuttlefish and there he
is is droopy little eyes appear but they
could do pretty amazing things too here
we&#39;re going to see one backing into
crevice and and watches watches
tentacles you just pulls them in makes
them look just like LG disappears right
into the background positive amazing
here&#39;s two males fighting once again
they&#39;re smart enough these cephalopods
they know not to hurt each other but
look at the patterns that they can do
with their skin okay just an amazing
thing here&#39;s an octopus sometimes they
don&#39;t want to be seen when they move
because predators can see them and here
this is this guy actually can make
himself look like a rock and looking at
this environment can actually slide
across the bottom using the waves in the
shadows so we can&#39;t be seen he just
blends right into the his motion blends
right into the background
the moving rock trick so we&#39;re learning
lots new from the shallow water still
exploring that deep learning lots from
the shallow water as a good reason why I
mean the shallow water is full of
predators here&#39;s a barracuda and if
you&#39;re an octopus or a cephalopod you
need to really understand how to use
your surroundings to hide in the next
scene you&#39;re going to see a nice coral
bottom and you see that an octopus would
stand out very easily there if you
couldn&#39;t use your camouflage use your
skin to change color and texture because
some algae in the foreground and an
octopus
in that amazing now Roger spooked him so
itsy took off the cloud of ink lands and
when he lands the octopus says I&#39;ve been
seeing best thing to do is get as big as
I can get that big brown makes his eye
spot very big so he&#39;s bluffing let&#39;s do
it backwards I thought he was joking
when he first showed it so I thought was
all graphics so here here it is in
Reverse watch the skin color watch the
skin texture just an amazing animal can
change color and texture to match the
surroundings watch them blend right into
this LG one two three now he&#39;s gone and
so am I thank you very much
I do both
