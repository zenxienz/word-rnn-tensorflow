so how many of you have ever gotten
behind the wheel of a car when you
really shouldn&#39;t have been driving maybe
you&#39;re out on the road for a long day
and you just wanted to get home you&#39;re
tired but you felt you could drive a few
more miles maybe you thought I&#39;ve had
less to drink than everybody else I
should be the one to go home or maybe
your mind was just entirely elsewhere
does this sound familiar to you now in
those situations wouldn&#39;t it be great if
there was a button on your dashboard
that you could push and the car would
get you home safely now that&#39;s been the
promise of the self-driving car the
autonomous vehicle and it&#39;s been the
dream since at least 19 39 when General
Motors showcased this idea there
futurama booth at the World&#39;s Fair now
it&#39;s been one of those dreams that&#39;s
always seemed about 20 years in the
future now two weeks ago that dream took
a step forward when the state of Nevada
granted Google&#39;s self-driving car the
very first license for an autonomous
vehicle clearly establishing that it&#39;s
legal for them to test it on the roads
in Nevada now california is considering
similar legislation and this would make
sure that the autonomous car is not one
of those things that has to stay in
vegas
now in my lab at Stanford we&#39;ve been
working on autonomous cars too but with
a slightly different spin on things you
see we&#39;ve been developing robotic race
cars cars that can actually push
themselves to the very limits of
physical performance now why would we
want to do such a thing well there&#39;s two
really good reasons for this first we
believe that before people turn over
control to an autonomous car that
autonomous car should be at least as
good as the very best human drivers now
if you&#39;re like me and the other seventy
percent of the population who know that
we are above average drivers you
understand that&#39;s a very high bar
there&#39;s another reason as well just like
race car drivers can use all of the
friction between the tire and the road
all of the cars capabilities to go as
fast as possible we want to use all of
those capabilities to avoid any accident
we can now you may push the car to the
limits not because you&#39;re driving too
fast but because you&#39;d hit an icy patch
of Road conditions have changed in those
situations we want a car that is capable
enough to avoid any accident that can
physically be avoided I must confess
there&#39;s kind of a third motivation as
well you see I have a passion for racing
in the past I&#39;ve been a race car owner a
crew chief and a driving coach although
maybe not at the level that you&#39;re
currently expecting one of the things
we&#39;ve developed in the lab we&#39;ve
developed several vehicles is what we
believe is the world&#39;s first
autonomously drifting car it&#39;s another
one of those categories where maybe
there&#39;s not a lot of competition
but this is p1 it&#39;s an entirely student
built electric vehicle which through
using its rear-wheel drive and front
wheel steer by wire can drift around
corners it can get sideways like a rally
car driver always able to take the
tightest curb even on slippery
unchanging surfaces never spinning out
we&#39;ve also worked with Volkswagen Oracle
on Shelley an autonomous race car that
has raced at 150 miles an hour through
the Bonneville Salt Flats gone around
Thunderhill Raceway Park in the Sun the
wind and the rain and navigated the 153
turns and 12.4 miles of the Pikes Peak
Hill Climb route in Colorado with nobody
at the wheel
I guess it goes without saying we&#39;ve had
a lot of fun doing this but in fact
there&#39;s something else that we&#39;ve
developed in the process of developing
these autonomous cars we have developed
a tremendous appreciation for the
capabilities of human race car drivers
as we&#39;ve looked at the question of how
well do these cars performed we wanted
to compare them to our human
counterparts and we discovered their
human counterparts are amazing now we
can take a map of a racetrack we can
take a mathematical model of a car and
with some iteration we can actually find
the fastest way around that track we
line that up with data that we record
from a professional driver and the
resemblance is absolutely remarkable yes
there are subtle differences here but
the human race car driver is able to go
out and drive an amazingly fast line
without the benefit of an algorithm that
compares the trade-off between going as
fast as possible in this corner and
shaving a little bit of time off of the
straight over here not only that they&#39;re
able to do it lap after lap after lap
they&#39;re able to go out and consistently
do this pushing the car to limits every
single time it&#39;s extraordinary to watch
you put them in a new car and after a
few laps they found the fastest line in
that car and they&#39;re off to the races it
really makes you think we&#39;d love to know
what&#39;s going on inside their brain so as
researchers that&#39;s what we decided to
find out we decided to instrument not
only the car but also the race car
driver to try to get a glimpse into what
was going on in their head as they were
doing this now this is dr. Lena harbert
applying electrodes to the head of John
Morton John Morton is a former can a man
EMSA driver who is also a class champion
limahl fantastic driver and very willing
to put up with graduate students and
this sort of research
she&#39;s putting electrodes on his head so
that we can monitor the electrical
activity in John&#39;s brain as he races
around the track now clearly we&#39;re not
going to put a couple of electrodes on
his head and understand exactly what all
of his thoughts are on the track however
neuro scientists have identified certain
patterns that let us tease out some very
important aspects of this for instance
the resting brain tends to generate a
lot of alpha waves in contrast theta
waves are associated with a lot of
cognitive activity like visual
processing things where the driver is
thinking quite a bit now we can measure
this and we can look at the relative
power between the theta waves and the
alpha waves this gives us a measure of
mental workload how much the driver is
actually challenged cognitively at any
point along the track now we wanted to
see if we could actually record this on
the track so we headed down south to
Laguna Seca we&#39;re going to take as a
legendary Raceway about halfway between
Salinas and Monterey it has a curve
there called the corkscrew now the
corkscrew is a chicane followed by a
quick right-handed turn as the road
drops three stories now the strategy for
driving this has explained to me was you
aim for the bush in the distance and as
the road falls away you realize it was
actually the top of a tree all right so
thanks to the revs program in Stanford
we were able to take John there and put
him behind the wheel of a 1960 Porsche
abarth Carrera life is way too short for
boring cars so here you see John on the
track he&#39;s going up the hill Oh somebody
like that and you can see actually his
mental workload measuring here in the
red bar you can see his actions as he
approaches now watch he has to downshift
and then he has to turn left look for
the tree and down not surprisingly you
can see this is a pretty challenging
task you can see his mental workload
spike as he goes through this as you
would expect with something that
requires this level of complexity but
what&#39;s really interesting is to look at
areas to the track where his mental
workload doesn&#39;t increase I&#39;m going to
take you around out of the other side of
the track turn three John&#39;s going to go
into that corner of the rear end of the
car is going to begin to slide out he&#39;s
going to have to correct for that with
steering so watch as John
this here watch the mental workload and
watch the steering the car begins to
slide out traumatic maneuver to correct
it and no change whatsoever in the
mental workload not a challenging task
in fact entirely reflexive now our data
processing on this is still preliminary
but it really seems that these
phenomenal feats that the race car
drivers are performing our instinctive
they are things that they have simply
learned to do it requires very little
mental workload for them to perform
these amazing feats and their actions
are fantastic this is exactly what you
want to do on the steering wheel to
catch the car in this situation now this
has given us tremendous insight and
inspiration for our own autonomous
vehicles we started to ask the question
can we make them a little less
algorithmic and a little more intuitive
can we take this reflexive action that
we see from the very best race car
drivers introduce it to our cars and
maybe even into a system that could get
on your car in the future that would
take us a long step along the road to
autonomous vehicles that drive as well
as the best humans but it&#39;s made us
think a little bit more deeply as well
do we want something more from our car
than to simply be a chauffeur do we want
our car to perhaps be a partner a coach
someone that can use their understanding
of the situation to help us reach our
potential can in fact the technology not
simply replace humans but allow us to
reach the level of reflex and intuition
that we&#39;re all capable of so as we move
forward into this technological future I
want you just pause and think of that
for a moment what is the ideal balance
of human and machine and as we think
about that let&#39;s take inspiration from
the absolutely amazing capabilities of
the human body and the human mind thank
