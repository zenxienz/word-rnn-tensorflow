imagine if you could record your life
everything you said everything you did
available in a perfect memory store at
your fingertips so you could go back and
find memorable moments and relive them
or sift through traces of time and
discover patterns in your own life that
previously had gone undiscovered well
that&#39;s exactly the journey that my
family began five and a half years ago
this is my wife and collaborator rupal
and on this day at this moment we walked
into the house with their first child
our beautiful baby boy and we walked
into a house with a very special home
video recording system okay
this moment and thousands of other
moments special for us were captured in
our home because in every room in the
house if you looked up you&#39;d see a
camera and a microphone and if you look
down you get this bird&#39;s-eye view of the
room here&#39;s our living room the baby
bedroom kitchen dining room and the rest
of the house and all of these fed into a
disk array that was designed for a
continuous capture so here we are flying
through a day in our home as we move
from sunlit morning through incandescent
evening and finally lights out for the
day over the course of three years we
recorded eight to ten hours a day
amassing roughly a quarter million hours
of multitrack audio and video so you&#39;re
looking at a piece of what is by far the
largest home video collection ever made
and what this data represents for our
family at a personal level the the
impact has already been immense and
we&#39;re still learning its value countless
moments of unsolicited natural moments
not posed moments are captured there and
we&#39;re starting to learn how to discover
them and find them but there&#39;s also a
scientific reason that drove this
project which was to use this kind of
natural longitudinal data to understand
the process of how a child learns
language that child being my son and so
with many privacy provisions put in
place to protect everyone who is
recorded in the data we made elements of
the data available to my trusted
research team at MIT so we could start
teasing apart patterns in this massive
data set trying to understand the
influence of social environments on
language acquisition so we&#39;re looking
here at one of the first things we
started to do this is my wife and I
cooking breakfast in the kitchen and as
we move through space and through time a
very everyday pattern of life in the
kitchen in order to convert this opaque
90 thousand hours of video into
something we can start to see we use
motion analysis to pull out as we move
through space and through time what we
call space-time worms and this has
become a part of our toolkit for being
able to look and see where the
activities are in the data and with it
trace the patterns of in particular
where my son moved throughout the home
so we could focus our transcription
efforts all the speech environment
around my son all the words that he
heard for myself my wife our nanny and
over time the words he began to produce
so with that technology and that data
and the ability to with mission
assistance transcribed speech we&#39;ve now
transcribed well over seven million
words of our home transcripts and with
that let me take you now for a first
tour into the data so you&#39;ve all I&#39;m
sure see
time-lapse videos where a flower will
blossom as you accelerate time I&#39;d like
you to now experience the blossoming of
a speech form my son soon after his
first birthday would say Gaga to mean
water and over the course the next half
year he slowly learned to approximate
the proper adult form water so we&#39;re
going to cruise through half a year in
about 40 seconds
no video here so you can focus on the
sound the acoustics of a new kind of
trajectory
so he didn&#39;t just learn water over the
course of the 24 months the first two
years that we really focused on this is
a map of every word he learned in
chronological order and because we have
full transcripts we&#39;ve identified each
of the 503 words that he learned to
produce by his second birthday he was an
early talker and so we started to
analyze why why were certain words born
before others this is one of the first
results that came out of our study a
little over a year ago that really
surprised us the way to interpret this
apparently simple graph is on the
vertical is an indication of how complex
caregiver utterances are based on the
length of utterances and the vertical
axis is time and all of the data we
aligned based on the following idea
every time my son would learn a word we
would trace back and look at all of the
language he heard that contain that word
and we would plot the relative length of
the utterances and what we found was
this curious phenomena that caregiver
speech would systematically dip to a
minimum
making language as simple as possible
and then slowly ascend back up in
complexity and the amazing thing was
that the fat bounce that dip lined up
almost precisely with when each word was
born word after word systematically so
it appears that all three primary
caregivers myself my wife and our nanny
were systematically and I would think
subconsciously restructuring our
language to meet him at the moment of
the birth of a word and bring him gently
into more complex language and the
implications of this there are many but
one I just want to point out is that
there must be amazing feedback loops
it&#39;s not of course my son is learning
from his linguistic environment but the
environment is learning from him that
environment people are in these type
feedback loops and creating a kind of
scaffolding that has not been noticed
until now but that&#39;s looking at the
speech context what about the visual
context we&#39;re now looking at think of
this as a dollhouse cutaway of the of
our
we&#39;ve taken those circular fisheye lens
cameras and we&#39;ve done some optical
correction and then we can bring it into
a three dimensional life so welcome to
my home this is a moment one moment
captured across multiple cameras the
reason we did this is to create the
ultimate memory machine where you can go
back and interactively fly around and
then breathe video life into this system
what I&#39;m going to do is give you an
accelerated view of 30 minutes again of
just life in the living room that&#39;s me
and my son on the floor and there&#39;s
video analytics that are tracking our
movements my son is leaving red ink
I&#39;m leaving green ink we&#39;re now on the
couch looking out through the window at
cars passing by and finally my son
playing in a walking toy by himself
now we freeze the action 30 minutes we
turn time into the vertical axis and we
open up for a view of these interaction
traces we&#39;ve just left behind and we see
these amazing structures these little
knots of two colors of thread we call
social hotspots the spiral thread we
call a solo hotspot and we think that
these affect the way languages learn
what we&#39;d like to do is start
understanding the interaction between
these patterns and the language that my
son is exposed to to see if we can
predict how the structure of when words
are heard affects when they&#39;re learned
so in other words the relationship
between words and what they&#39;re about in
the world so here&#39;s how we&#39;re
approaching this in this video again my
son is being traced out he&#39;s leaving red
ink behind and there&#39;s our nanny by the
door your mother
all right she offers water and off go
the two worms over to the kitchen to get
water and what we&#39;ve done is use the
word water to tag that moment that bit
of activity and now we take the power of
data and take every time my son ever
heard the word water and the context he
saw it in and we use it to penetrate
through the video and find every
activity trace that Co occurred with the
instance of water and what this data
leaves in its wake is a landscape we
call these word scapes this is the word
scape for the word water and you can see
most of the action is in the kitchen
that&#39;s where those big Peaks are over to
the left and just for contrast we can do
this with any word we can take the word
by as in goodbye
and we&#39;re now sumed in over the entrance
to the house and we look and we find as
you&#39;d expect a contrast in the landscape
where the word by occurs much more in a
structured way so we&#39;re using these
structures to start predicting the order
of language acquisition and that&#39;s
sauron going work now in my lab which
we&#39;re peering into now at MIT this is at
the Media Lab this has become my
favorite way of video graphing just
about any space three of the key people
in this project fill up the camp Ronny
cubot and Brandon Roy are pictured here
Phillip has been a close collaborator
and all the visualizations you&#39;re seeing
and Michael Fleischman was another PhD
student in my lab who worked with me on
this home video analysis and he made the
following observation that just the way
that we&#39;re analyzing how language
connects to events which provide common
ground for language that same idea we
can take out of your home Deb and we can
apply it to the world of public media
and so our effort took an unexpected
turn
think of mass media as providing common
ground and you have the recipe for
taking this idea to a whole new place
we&#39;ve started analyzing television
content using this same principles
analyzing event structure of a TV signal
episodes of shows commercials all of the
components that make up the event
structure we&#39;re now with satellite
dishes pulling in and analyzing a good
part of all the TV we watched in the
United States and you don&#39;t have to now
go in instrument living rooms with
microphones to get people&#39;s
conversations you just tuned into
publicly available social media feeds so
we&#39;re pulling in about 3 billion
comments a month and then the magic
happens you have the event structure the
common ground that the words are about
coming out of the television feeds
you&#39;ve got the conversations that are
about that those topics and through
semantic analysis and this is actually
real data you&#39;re looking at from our
data are processing each yellow line is
showing a link being made between a
comment in the wild and a piece of event
structure coming out of the television
signal and the same idea now can be
built up and we get this word scape
except now words are not assembled in my
living room instead the context the
common ground the activities are the
content on television that&#39;s driving the
conversations and so what we&#39;re seeing
here these skyscrapers now are
commentary that are linked to content on
television same concept but looking at
communication dynamics in a different
very different sphere so fundamentally
rather than for example measuring
content based on how many people are
watching this gives us the basic data
for looking at engagement properties of
content and just like we can look at
feedback cycles and dynamics in you know
in a family we can now open up the same
concepts and look at much larger groups
of people this is a subset of data from
our database just 50 thousand out of
several million and the social graph
that connects them through publicly
available sources and if you put them on
one plane a second plane is where the
content lives so we have the programs
and the the sporting events and the
commercials and all of the link
structures that tie them together make a
Content graph
and then the important third dimension
each of the links that you&#39;re seeing
rendered here is an actual connection
made between something someone said and
a piece of content and there are again
now tens of millions of these links that
give us the connective tissue of social
graphs and how they relate to content
and we can now start to probe the
structure in interesting ways so if we
for example trace the path of one piece
of content that drives someone to
comment on it and then we follower that
comment goes and look at the entire
social graph that becomes activated and
then trace back to see the relationship
between that social graph and content
very interesting structure becomes
visible we call this a co-viewing clique
a virtual living room if you will and
there are fascinating dynamics at play
it&#39;s not one-way a piece of content an
event causes someone to talk they talk
to other people that drives TuneIn
behavior back into mass media and you
have these cycles that drive the overall
behavior another example very different
another actual person in our database
and we&#39;re finding at least hundreds if
not thousands of these we&#39;ve given this
person a name this is a pro amateur or
pro a media critic who has this high
fan-out race a lot of people are
following this person very influential
and they have a propensity to talk about
what&#39;s on TV so this person is a key
link in connecting mass media and social
media together one last example when
this data sometimes it&#39;s actually a
piece of content that is special so if
we go and look at this piece of content
President Obama&#39;s State of the Union
address from just a few weeks ago and
look at what we find in in the same data
set at the same scale the engagement
properties of this piece of content are
truly remarkable a nation exploding in
conversation in real time in response to
what&#39;s on on the broadcast and of course
through all of these lines are flowing
unstructured language we can x-ray and
get a real-time
pulse of a nation real-time sense of the
social reactions in the different
circuits in the social graph being
activated by content so to summarize the
idea is this as our world becomes
increasingly instrumented and we have
the capabilities to collect and connect
the dots between what people are saying
in the context they&#39;re saying and what&#39;s
emerging is an ability to see new social
structures and dynamics that have
previously not been seen it&#39;s like
building a microscope or telescope and
revealing new structures about our own
behavior around communication and I
think the implications here are profound
whether it&#39;s for science for commerce
for government but perhaps most of all
for us as individuals and so just to
return to my son
when I was preparing this talk he was
looking over my shoulder and I showed
him the clips I was going to show to you
today and I asked him for permission
granted and and then I went on to
reflect isn&#39;t it amazing
this entire database all these
recordings I&#39;m going to hand up to you
and to your sister who arrived two years
later and you guys are gonna be able to
go back and re-experience moments that
you could never with your biological
memory possibly remember the way you can
now and he was quiet for a moment I
thought one of my thinking is he&#39;s five
years old he does is not going to
understand this and just as I was having
that thought he looked up at me and said
so that when I grow up I can show this
to my kids and I thought wow this is
this is powerful stuff so I want to
leave you with one last memorable moment
from our family this is our the first
time our son took more than two steps at
once captured on film and I really want
you to focus on something as I take you
through it&#39;s a cluttered environments
it&#39;s natural life my mother&#39;s in the
kitchen cooking and of all places in the
hallway I realize he&#39;s about to do it
but to take more than two steps and so
you hear me encouraging him realizing
what&#39;s happening
then the magic happens listen very
carefully about three steps in he
realizes something magic is happening
and the most amazing feedback loop of
all kicks in and he takes a breath in
and he whispers Wow and instinctively I
echo I echo back the same so let&#39;s fly
back in time to that memorable moment he
do it boy do it nice walking
when I think about succeeding in
business I think there&#39;s a couple of
considerations first and foremost is
teamwork today&#39;s problems are just too
complicated to be solved as an
individual and the opportunity to work
with others collaboratively where you
can build on each other&#39;s ideas I think
is particularly important I think a
second area that&#39;s quite important is
the understanding of different
disciplines it is critical that one be
an expert in your major but it is
absolutely essential that you have the
ability to understand where other
disciplines the input from other
disciplines and be able to incorporate
that to make effective decisions and
then last but not least we are in a
global business community and so the
opportunity to understand cultures
different cultures around the world to
be able to incorporate some of the
learning from those cultures and to
incorporate that into your business
decisions is essential to success I have
three degrees from Cornell so I&#39;d say
just about everything that has prepared
me came from Cornell and I am indebted
to the University for that experience
but as I think particularly about my
business school career I think the
exposure to a variety of disciplines the
wealth of resources across the
university
we&#39;re exceptionally helpful
