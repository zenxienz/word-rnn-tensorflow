I want to talk about what we learn from
conservatives and I&#39;m at a stage in life
where I&#39;m yearning for my old days so I
want to confess to you that when I was a
kid indeed I was a conservative I was a
young Republican a teenage Republic and
a leader in the teenage republicans
indeed I was the youngest member of any
delegation in the nineteen eighty
convention that elected Ronald Reagan to
be the Republican nominee for president
now I know what you&#39;re thinking you&#39;re
thinking that&#39;s not what the Internet&#39;s
say you&#39;re thinking Wikipedia doesn&#39;t
say this fact and indeed this is just
one of the examples of the junk that
flows across the tubes in these
internets here wikipedia reports that
this guy this former congressman from
erie pennsylvania was at the age of
twenty one of the youngest people at the
republican national convention but it&#39;s
just not true indeed it drives me so
nuts let me just change this little
friend
all right okay so perfect speaker
Lawrence Lessig right okay hey finally
truth will be brought here okay see
right it&#39;s done it&#39;s almost done here we
go youngest Republic okay we&#39;re finished
that&#39;s it please save this great hugger
and Wikipedia is fixed finally ok but no
this is really besides the point but the
thing I want you to think about when we
think about conservatives not so much
this issue of the 1980 convention the
thing to think about is this they go to
church oh yeah you know I mean a lot of
people go to church I&#39;m not talking
about that only conservatives go to
church and I&#39;m not talking about the god
thing I don&#39;t want to get into that you
know that&#39;s not my point they go to
church by which I mean they do lots of
things for free for each other they hold
potluck dinners indeed they sell books
about potluck dinners they serve food to
poor people they share they give they
give away for free and it&#39;s the very
same people leading Wall Street firms
who on sunday show up and share and not
only food right these very same people
are strong believers in lots of context
in the limits on the markets they are in
many important places against markets
indeed they like all of us celebrate
this kind of relationship and they&#39;re
very keen that we don&#39;t let money drop
into that relationship else it turns
into something like this they want to
regulate us those conservatives to stop
us from allowing the market to spread in
those places because they understand
there are places for the market and
places where the market should not exist
where we should be free to enjoy the
fellowship
of others they recognize both of these
things have to live together and second
great thing about conservatives they get
a ecology right it was the first great
Republican president of the 20th century
who taught us about environmental
thinking Teddy Roosevelt they first
taught us about ecologies in the context
of natural resources and then they began
to teach us in the context of innovation
economics they understand in that
context free they understand free is an
important essential part of the cultural
ecology as well that&#39;s the thing I want
you to think about that now I know you
don&#39;t believe me really here so here&#39;s
exhibit number one I want to share with
you my latest hero Julian Sanchez a
libertarian who works at the for many
people evil Cato Institute ok so Julian
made this video he&#39;s a terrible producer
of videos but it&#39;s great content I&#39;m
gonna give you a little bit of it so
here he is beginning I wanted to make an
observation about the way remix culture
seems to be evolved so when he judges he
begins to tell us about these three days
this is fantastic Brad pack remix sad to
this which requires spread virally
hugely successful and then two people
from Brooklyn saw it they decided they
wanted to do the same
and then of course people from San
Francisco saw it in San Francisco&#39;s
thought they had to do the same as well
so simple
they&#39;re beautiful but this libertarian
has some important lessons he wants us
to learn from this here&#39;s lesson number
one there&#39;s obviously also something
really deeply great about this they&#39;re
acting in the sense that they&#39;re
emulating the original mashup as the guy
you shot it obviously has a strong I and
some experience with video editing but
this is also basically just a group of
friends having an authentic social
moment and screwing around together it
should feel familiar I&#39;m kind of
resonating for anyone who&#39;s at a
sing-along or dance party with a group
of good friends or so that&#39;s importantly
different from the earlier videos we
looked at because here remix isn&#39;t just
about an individual doing something
alone in his basement it becomes an
active social creativity and it&#39;s not
just that it yields a different kind of
product at the end is it potentially it
changes the way we relate to each other
all of our normal social interactions
become a kind of invitation to this sort
of collective expression it&#39;s our real
social lives themselves that are
transmuted into art and so that I
pristine Rotarian draws from these two
points one remix is about individuals
using our shared culture as a kind of
language to communicate something to an
audience stage to social remix is really
about using it to mediate people&#39;s
relationships with each other first
within each video the brat pack
characters are used as a kind of
template for performing the social
reality of each group but there&#39;s also a
dialogue between the videos where once
the basic structure is established it
becomes a kind of platform for
articulating the similarities and
differences between the groups social
and physical worlds and then there&#39;s for
me the critical key to what Julian has
to say copyright policy isn&#39;t just about
how to incentivize the production of a
certain kind of artistic commodity it&#39;s
about what level of control we&#39;re going
to permit to
be exercised over our social realities
social realities that are now inevitably
permeated by pop culture I think it&#39;s
important that we keep these two
different kinds of public goods in mind
if we&#39;re only focused on how to maximize
the supply of one I think we risk
suppressing this different and richer
and in some ways maybe even more
important right bingo point freedom
needs this opportunity to both have the
commercial success of the great
commercial works and the opportunity to
build this different kind of culture and
for that to happen you need ideas like
fair used to be central and protected to
enable this kind of innovation as this
libertarian tells us between these two
creative cultures a commercial and a
sharing culture the point is they he
here gets that culture now my concern is
we dems too often not so much right
think for example about this great
company in the good old days when this
Republican ran that company their
greatest work was work that built on the
past right all of the great disney works
where works that took works that were in
the public domain and remixed them or
wait until they entered to the public
domain to remix them to celebrate this
addon remix creativity indeed Mickey
Mouse himself of course as Steamboat
Willie is a remix of the then very
dominant very popular steamboat bill by
Buster Keaton this man was a remixer
extraordinary he is the celebration and
ideal of exactly this kind of creativity
but then the company passes in through
this dark stage to this democrat wildly
different this is the mastermind behind
the eventual passage of what we call the
Sonny Bono copyright term extension act
extending the term of existing
copyrights by 20 years so that no one
could do to Disney what Disney
did to the Brothers Grimm now when we
tried to challenge this going to the
Supreme Court getting the supreme court
the bunch of conservatives there if we
could get them to wake up to this to
strike it down we had the assistance of
Nobel Prize winners including this
right-wing Nobel Prize winner Milton
Friedman who said he would join our
brief only if the word no-brainer was in
the brief somewhere but apparently no
brains existed in this place when
Democrats passed and signed this bill
into law now tiny little quibble of a
footnote Sonny Bono you might say was a
Republican but I don&#39;t buy it this guy
is my a couple of thing okay our second
example think about this cultural hero
icon on the Left creator of this
character look at the site that he built
Star Wars mashup inviting people to come
and use their creative energy to produce
a new generation of attention towards
this extraordinarily important cultural
icon read the license the license for
these remixers assigns all of the rights
to the remix back to Lucas the mash-up
is owned by Lucas indeed anything you
add to the mashup music you might add
Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right to
exploit that for free there is no
creator here to be recognized a creator
doesn&#39;t have any rights the Creator is a
sharecropper in this story and we should
remember who employ the sharecroppers
the Democrats right so the point is the
Republicans here recognize that there&#39;s
a certain need of ownership our respect
for ownership the respect we should give
to the Creator the remixer the owner the
property owner the copyright owner of
this extraordinarily powerful stuff and
not a generation of sharecroppers now I
think there are lessons we should learn
here lessons about openness our lives
are sharing activities at least in part
even for the head of Goldman Sachs
at least in part and for that sharing
activity to happen we have to have well
protected spaces of fair use that&#39;s
number one number two the psychology of
sharing needs freedom within which to
create freedom which means without
permission from anyone the ability to
create and number three we need to
respect the Creator the creator of these
remixes through rights that are directly
tied to them now this explains the right
wing nonprofit creativecommons actually
it&#39;s not a right wing plan profit but of
course let me just tie it here the
Creative Commons which is offering
authors this simple way to mark their
content with the freedoms they intended
to carry so that we go from a all rights
reserved world to a some rights reserved
world so that people can know the
freedoms they have attached to the
content building and creating on the
basis of this creative copyrighted work
these tools that we built enable this
sharing in part through licenses that
make it clear and a freedom to create
without requiring permission first
because the permission has already been
granted and a respect for the creator
because it builds upon a copyright the
Creator happs licensed freely and it
explains the vast right-wing conspiracy
that&#39;s obviously developed around these
licenses as now more than 350 million
digital objects are out there licensed
freely in this way now that picture of
an ecology of creativity the picture of
an ecology of balanced creativity is
that the ecology of creativity we have
right now well as you all know not many
of us believe we do I tripped on the
reality of this ecology of creativity
just last week I created a video which
was based on a wire side chat that I had
given and I uploaded it to YouTube I
then got this email from YouTube weirdly
notifying me that there was content in
that owned by the mysterious w
mg that matched their content ID I
didn&#39;t think much about it and then on
Twitter somebody said to me your talk on
youtube was dmca age was that your
purpose imagining that I had this deep
conspiracy to reveal the obvious flaws
in the DMCA answer no I didn&#39;t even
think about it but then I went to the
site and all of the audio in my site had
been silenced my whole 45 minute video
had been silenced because they were
snippets in that video a video about
fair use that included warner music
group music now interestingly they still
sold ads for that music if you play the
silent video you can still buy the music
but you couldn&#39;t hear anything because
it had been silenced so I did what the
current regime says I must do to be free
to use YouTube to talk about fair use I
went to this site and I had to answer
these questions and then in an
extraordinarily Bart Simpson like
juvenile way you&#39;ve actually got to type
out these words and get them rights to
research your freedom to speak and I
felt like I was in third grade again I
will not put tax on the teachers chair i
will not good taxing the teachers share
via c is absurd it is outrageous it is
extraordinary perversion of the system
of freedom we should be encouraging and
the question I ask you is who&#39;s fighting
it well interestingly in the last
presidential election who was the number
one active opponents of this system of
regulation in online speech John McCain
letter after letter attacking YouTube&#39;s
refusal to be more respectful of fair
use but they&#39;re extraordinary notice and
takedown system that led his campaign so
many times to be thrown off the internet
now that was a story of me then my good
old days of right-wing lunacy let me
come back to now now when I&#39;m a live a
leftist I&#39;m certainly left-handed so at
least a lefty and I wonder can we
on the left expect to build this ecology
of freedom now in a world where we know
the extraordinary powerful influences
against it we&#39;re even icons of the left
like this entertain and push bills that
would effectively ban the requirement of
open access for government-funded
research the president who has supported
a process that secretly negotiates
agreements which effectively lock us
into the insane system of DNS dmca that
we have adopted and likely lockets down
a path of three strikes you&#39;re out then
of course the rest of the world are
increasingly adopting not a single
example of reform has been produced yet
and we&#39;re not going to see this change
in this system anytime soon so here&#39;s
the lessons of openness that I think we
need to learn openness is a commitment
to a certain set of values we need to
speak of those values the value of
freedom it&#39;s a value of community it&#39;s a
value of the limits in regulation it&#39;s a
value respecting the Creator now if we
can learn those values from at least
some influences on the right if we can
take them and incorporate them maybe we
could do a little trade we learn those
values on the left and maybe they&#39;ll do
health care or global warming
legislation or something on the right
anyway please join me in teaching these
values thank you very much
