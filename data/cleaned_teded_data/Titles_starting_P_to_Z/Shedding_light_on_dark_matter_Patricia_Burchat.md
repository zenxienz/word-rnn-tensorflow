as a particle physicist I study the
elementary particles and how they
interact on the most fundamental level
for most of my research career I&#39;ve been
using accelerators such as the electron
accelerator at Stanford University just
up the road to study things on the
smallest scale but more recently I&#39;ve
been turning my attention to the
universe on the largest scale because as
I&#39;ll explain to you the questions on the
smallest and the largest scale are
actually very connected so I&#39;m going to
tell you about our 21st century view of
the universe what it&#39;s made of and what
the big questions in the physical
sciences are at least some of the big
questions so recently we have realized
that the ordinary matter in the universe
and by ordinary matter
I mean you okay me the planets the Stars
the galaxies the ordinary matter makes
up only a few percent of the content of
the universe
almost a quarter approximately a quarter
of the matter in the universe is stuff
that&#39;s invisible by invisible I mean it
doesn&#39;t absorb in the electromagnetic
spectrum it doesn&#39;t emit in the
electromagnetic spectrum it doesn&#39;t
reflect it doesn&#39;t interact with the
electromagnetic spectrum which is what
we use to detect things doesn&#39;t interact
at all so how do we know it&#39;s there we
know it&#39;s there by its gravitational
effects in fact this dark matter
dominates the gravitational effects in
the universe on a large scale and I&#39;ll
be telling you about the evidence for
that what about the rest of the pie the
rest of the pie is a very mysterious
substance called dark energy more about
that later okay so for now let&#39;s turn to
the evidence for dark matter in these
galaxies especially in a spiral galaxy
like this most of the mass of the stars
is concentrated in the middle of the
galaxy this huge mass of all these stars
keeps stars in circular orbits in the
galaxy so we have these stars going
around in circles like this as you can
imagine even if you know though physics
this should be intuitive okay that stars
that are closer to the mass in the
middle will be rotating at a higher
speed than those that are further out
here okay so what you would expect is
that if you measured the orbital speed
of the star
that they should be slower on the edges
than on the inside in other words if we
measured speed as a function of distance
this is the only time I&#39;m going to show
a graph okay we would expect that it
goes down as the distance increases from
the center of the galaxy when those
measurements are made instead what we
find is that the speed is basically
constant as a function of distance if
it&#39;s constant that means that the stars
out here are feeling the gravitational
effects of matter that we do not see in
fact this galaxy and every other galaxy
appears to be embedded in a cloud of
this invisible dark matter and this
cloud of matter is much more spherical
than the galaxies themselves and it
extends over much what wider range than
the galaxy so we see the galaxy and
fixate on that but it&#39;s actually a cloud
of dark matter that&#39;s dominating the
structure and the dynamics of this
galaxy galaxies themselves are not
strewn randomly in space they tend to
cluster and this is an example of a very
actually famous cluster the Coma Cluster
and there are thousands of galaxies in
this cluster they&#39;re the white fuzzy
elliptical things here so these galaxy
clusters we take a snapshot now we take
a snapshot in a decade it&#39;ll look
identical but these galaxies are
actually moving at extremely high speeds
they&#39;re moving around in this
gravitational potential well of this
cluster okay so all these galaxies are
moving we can measure the speeds of
these galaxies their orbital velocities
and figure out how much mass is in this
cluster and again what we find is that
there is much more mass there than can
be accounted for by the galaxies that we
see or if we look in other parts of the
electromagnetic spectrum we see that
there&#39;s a lot of gas in this cluster as
well but that cannot account for the
mass either in fact there appears to be
about ten times as much mass here in the
form of this invisible or dark matter as
there is in the ordinary matter okay
it would be nice if we could see this
dark matter a little bit more directly
I&#39;m just putting this big blue blob on
there okay to try to remind you that
it&#39;s there can we see it more visually
yes we can and so let me lead you
through how we can do this so here is an
observer it could be an eye could be a
telescope and suppose there&#39;s a galaxy
out here in the universe
how do we see that galaxy a ray of light
leaves the galaxy and travels through
the universe for perhaps billions of
years before it enters the telescope or
your eye now how do we deduce where the
galaxy is what we deduce it by the
direction that the Ray is traveling as
it enters our eye right we say the ray
of light came this way the galaxy must
be there okay now suppose I put in the
middle a cluster of galaxies and don&#39;t
forget the dark matter okay now if we
consider a different ray of light one
going off like this
we now need to take into account what
Einstein predicted when he developed
general relativity and that was that the
gravitational field due to mass will
deflect not only the trajectory of
particles but will deflect light itself
so this light ray will not continue in a
straight line but would rather band and
could end up going into our eye where
will this observer see the galaxy you
can respond up right we extrapolate
backwards and say the galaxy is up here
is there any other ray of light that
could make it into the observers eye
from that galaxy yes great I see people
going down like this so a ray of light
could go down be bent up into the
observers eye and the observer sees a
ray of light here now take into account
the fact that we live in a
three-dimensional universe okay three
dimensional space are there any other
rays of light that could make it into
the eye yes the Rays would lie on a I
like to say yeah on a account so there&#39;s
a whole way of light rays of light on a
cone that will all be bent by that
cluster and make it into the observers
eye if there&#39;s a cone of light coming
into my eye what do I see a circle a
ring it&#39;s called an Einstein ring
Einstein predicted that okay now it&#39;ll
only be a perfect ring if the source the
deflector and the eyeball in this case
are all in a perfectly straight line if
they&#39;re slightly skewed we&#39;ll see a
different image now you can do an
experiment tonight over the reception
okay to figure out what that image will
look like because it turns out that
there is a kind of lens that we can
devise that has the right shape to
produce
this kind of effect we call this
gravitational lensing and so this is
your instrument okay but ignore the top
part it&#39;s the base that I want you to
concentrate okay so actually at home
whenever we break a wineglass I save the
bottom take it over to the machine shop
we shave it off and I have a little
gravitational lens okay so it&#39;s got the
right shape to produce the lensing and
so the next thing you need to do in your
experiment is I grab a napkin I grabbed
a piece of graph paper I&#39;m a physicist
so a napkin draw a little model galaxy
in the middle and now put the lens over
the galaxy and what you&#39;ll find is that
you will see a ring an Einstein ring now
move the base off to the side and the
ring will split up into arcs okay and
you can put it on top of any image on
the graph paper you can see how the the
lines on the graph paper have been
distorted and again this is a kind of an
accurate model of what happens with the
gravitational lensing okay
so the question is do we see this in the
sky do we see arcs in the sky when we
look at say a cluster of galaxies and
the answer is yes and so here&#39;s an image
from the Hubble Space Telescope many of
the images you are seeing earlier from
the Hubble Space Telescope well first of
all the golden shaped galaxies those are
the galaxies in the cluster they&#39;re the
ones that are embedded in that sea of
dark matter that are causing the bending
of the light to cause these optical
illusions or mirages practically of the
background galaxies so the streaks that
you see all these streaks are actually
distorted images of galaxies that are
much further away so what we can do then
is based on how much distortion we see
in those images we can calculate how
much mass there must be in this cluster
and it&#39;s an enormous amount of mass and
also you can tell by eye by looking at
this that these arcs are not centered on
individual galaxies they are centered on
some more spread-out structure and that
is the dark matter that is being that is
in which the cluster is embedded okay so
this is the closest you can get to kind
of seeing at least the effects of the
dark matter with your naked eye okay so
a quick review then okay to say that
you&#39;re following so the evidence that we
have that a quarter of the universe is
dark
this gravitationally attracting stuff is
that galaxies the speeds with which
stars orbit and galaxies is much too
large it must be embedded in dark matter
the speed with which galaxies within
clusters are orbiting is much too large
it must be embedded in dark matter and
we see these gravitational lensing
effects these distortions that say that
again
clusters are embedded in dark matter ok
so now let&#39;s turn to dark energy so to
understand the evidence for dark energy
we need to discuss something that
Stephen Hawking referred to in the
previous session and that is the fact
that space itself is expanding so if we
imagine a section of our infinite
universe ok and so I&#39;ve put down four
spiral galaxies ok and imagine that you
put down a set of tape measures okay so
every line on here corresponds to a tape
measure horizontal or vertical for
measuring where things are if you could
do this
what you would find that with each
passing day each passing year each
passing billions of years okay the
distance between galaxies is getting
greater and it&#39;s not because galaxies
are moving away from each other through
space they&#39;re not necessarily moving
through space they are moving away from
each other because space itself is
getting bigger okay that&#39;s what the
expansion of the universe or space means
so they&#39;re moving further apart
now and what Stephen Hawking mentioned
as well is that after the Big Bang space
expanded at a very rapid rate
but because gravitationally attracting
matter is embedded in this space it
tends to slow down the expansion of the
space okay
so the expansion slows down with time so
in the last century okay people debated
about whether this expansion of space
would continue forever whether it would
slow down you know will be slowing down
but continue forever slowed down and
stopped asymptotically stopped or slowed
down stop and then reverse so it&#39;s start
to contract again so a little over a
decade ago two groups of business
astronomers set out to measure the rate
at which the expansion of space was
slowing down okay by how much less is
expanding today compared to say a couple
billion years ago the startling answer
to this question okay from these
experiments was that space is expanding
at a faster rate today than it was a few
billion years ago okay so the expansion
of space is actually speeding up this
was a completely surprising result there
is no persuasive theoretical argument
for why this should happen okay no one
was predicting ahead of time this is
what&#39;s going to be found it was the
opposite of what was expected so we need
something to be able to explain that now
it turns out in the mathematics you can
put it in as a term that&#39;s an energy but
it&#39;s a completely different type of
energy from anything we&#39;ve ever seen
before we call it dark energy and it has
this effect of causing space to expand
but we don&#39;t have a good motivation for
putting it in there at this point okay
so it&#39;s really unexplained as to why we
need to put it in now so at this point
then what I want to really emphasize to
you is that first of all dark matter and
dark energy are completely different
things okay
there are really two mysteries out there
as to what makes up most of the universe
and they have very different effects
dark matter because it gravitationally
attracts it tends to encourage the
growth of structure
okay so clusters of galaxies will tend
to form because of all this
gravitational attraction dark energy on
the other hand is putting more and more
space between the galaxies makes it the
gravitational attraction between them
decrease and so it impedes the growth of
structure so by looking at things like
clusters of galaxies and how they their
number density how many there are as a
function of time we can learn about how
dark matter and dark energy compete
against each other in structure forming
in terms of dark matter I said that we
don&#39;t have any you know really
persuasive argument for dark energy do
we have anything for dark matter and the
answer is yes we have well-motivated
candidates for the dark matter
now what do I mean by what well
motivated I mean that we have on
mathematically consistent theories that
were actually introduced to explain a
completely different phenomenon okay
things that I haven&#39;t even talked about
that each predict the existence of a
very weakly interacting new particle so
this is exactly what you want in physics
where a prediction comes out of a
mathematically consistent theory that
was actually developed for something
else but we don&#39;t know if either of
those are actually the Dark Matter
candidate okay one or both who knows or
it could be something completely
different
now we look for these dark matter
particles because after all they are
here in the room okay and they didn&#39;t
come in the door they just pass through
anything they can come through the
building through the earth there so
non-interacting so one way to look for
them is to build detectors that are
extremely sensitive to a dark matter
particle coming through and bumping it
so a crystal that will ring if that
happens so one of my colleagues up the
road and his collaborators have built
such a detector and they&#39;ve put it deep
down in an iron mine in Minnesota okay
deep under the ground in fact in the
last couple of days announced the most
sensitive results so far they haven&#39;t
seen anything okay
but it puts limits on what the mass and
the interaction strength of these dark
matter particles are there&#39;s going to be
a satellite telescope launched later
this year and it will look towards the
middle of the galaxy to see if we can
see dark matter particles annihilating
and producing gamma rays that could be
detected with this the Large Hadron
Collider a particle physics accelerator
that will be turning on later this year
it is possible that dark matter
particles might be produced at the Large
Hadron Collider now because they are so
non interactive they will actually
escape the detector so their signature
will be missing energy okay now
unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of new
physics whose signature could be missing
energy so it&#39;ll be hard to tell the
difference and finally for future
endeavors
there are telescopes being designed
specifically to address the questions of
dark matter and dark energy ground-based
telescope and there are three
space-based telescopes they&#39;re in
competition right now to be launched to
investigate dark matter and dark and
so in terms of the big questions what is
dark matter what is dark energy big
questions facing physics and I&#39;m sure
you have lots of questions which I very
much look forward to addressing over the
next 72 hours while I&#39;m here okay thank
