we are today talking about moral
persuasion what is moral and immoral in
trying to change people&#39;s behaviors by
using technology and using design and I
don&#39;t know what you expect but when I
was thinking about that issue I early on
realized what I&#39;m not able to give you
or answers I&#39;m not able to tell you what
is moral immoral because we&#39;re living in
a pluralist society my values can be
radically different from your values
which means that what i consider moral
or immoral based on that might not
necessarily be what you consider moral
or immoral but i also realized that
there is one thing that i could give you
and that is what this guy behind me gave
the world socrates it is questions what
I can do and what it would like to do
with you is give you like that initial
question a set of questions to figure
out for yourself layer by layer like
peeling an onion getting at the core of
what you believe is moral or immoral
Persian and I&#39;d like to do that with a
couple of examples of technologies where
people have used game elements to get
people to do things so that&#39;s the first
very simple a very obvious question I
would like to give you what are your
intentions if you are designing some and
obviously intentions are not the only
thing so here is another example for
long these applications there are a
couple of these kinds of eco dashboards
right now so dashboards built into cars
which try to motivate you to drive more
fuel-efficient Lee this here is Nissan&#39;s
my leave where you&#39;re driving behavior
is compared with the driving behavior
other people so you can compete for who
drives around the most fuel-efficient
Lee and these things are very effective
it turns out so effective that they
motivate people to engage it unsafe
driving behaviors like not stopping on a
redhead life because that way you have
to stop and restart the engine and that
would use quite some fuel right wouldn&#39;t
it so despite this being a very you know
well intended application obviously
there is a side effect to that and
here&#39;s another example for one of these
side effect commendable a site that
allows parents to give their kids little
badges for doing the things that parents
want their kids to do like tying their
shoes right and first of all that
sounded very nice very benign well
intended but it turns out if you look
into research on people&#39;s mindset that
caring about outcomes caring about
public recognitions caring about these
kinds of public tokens of recognitions
is not necessarily very helpful for your
long-term psychological well-being it&#39;s
better if you care about learning
something it&#39;s better when you care
about yourself then what how you appear
in front of other people so that kind of
motivational tool that is used actually
in and of itself has a long-term side
effect in that every time we use a
technology that uses something like
public recognition or status we&#39;re
actually positively endorsing this as a
good and a normal thing to care about
that way possibly having a detrimental
effect on the long-term psychological
well-being of our cells as a culture so
that&#39;s a second very obvious question
what are the effects of what you&#39;re
doing the effects that you&#39;re having
with the device like less fuel as well
as the effects of the actual tools
you&#39;re using to get people to do things
public recognition now is that all
intention in fact well there are some
technologies which obviously combine
both both good long-term and short-term
effects and a positive intention like
Fred Stutzman&#39;s freedom where the whole
point of that application is well you
know we are usually so bombarded with
with class and request by other people
with this device you can shut off the
internet connectivity of your PC of
choice for a preset amount of time to
actually get some work done and I think
most of us will agree well that&#39;s
something well intended and also has
good consequences right in the words of
Michelle Foucault it is a technology of
the south it is a technology that
empowers the individual to determine its
own life course to shape itself but the
problem is as 40 points out that every
technology of the self has a technology
of domination as its flip side as you
see in today&#39;s of modern liberal
democracies the society the state not
only allows us to determine our self to
shape our selves it also do
of us it demands that we optimize
ourselves that we can stroll ourselves
that we self-managed continuously
because that&#39;s the only way in which
such a liberal society works these
technologies want to stay us in want us
to stay in the game that society has
device for us they want us to fit in
even better they want us to optimize
ourselves to fit in now I don&#39;t say that
is necessarily a bad thing I just think
that this example points us to a general
realization and that is no matter what
technology or design you look at it even
something we consider as well intended
and as good in its effects like fruit
Stutzman&#39;s freedom comes with certain
values embedded in it and we can
question these values we can question is
it a good thing that all of us
continuously self optimize our selves to
fit better into that society or to give
you another example what about a piece
of persuasive technology that convinces
a Muslim women to wear their head
scarves is that a good or a bad
technology in its intentions or in its
effects well that basically depends on
the kind of values that you bring to
bear to make these kinds of judgments so
that&#39;s a third question what values do
you use to judge and speaking of values
I&#39;ve noticed that in a discussion about
moral persuasion online and when I
talking with people more often than not
there is a weird bias and that bias is
that we&#39;re asking is this or that still
ethical is it still permissible we&#39;re
asking things like is this Oxfam
donation form where the regular monthly
donation is the preset default and
people maybe without intending it or
that way kind of encouraged or notched
into giving a regular donation instead
of a one-time donation is that still
permissible is it still ethical we&#39;re
fishing at the low end but in fact that
question is it still ethical it&#39;s just
one way of looking at athletes because
if you look at the beginning of ethics
in an in Western culture you see a very
different idea of what ethics also could
be for Aristotle for Aristotle ethics
was not about the question
is that still good or is it bad ethics
was about the question of how to live
live well and he put that in the word
arrÃªtez which we from the latin
translators virtue but really it means
excellence it means living up to your
own full potential as a human being and
that is an idea that i think paul
richard canon nicely put in a recent
acid way said products of vivid
arguments about how we should live our
lives right our designs are not ethical
or unethical in that they&#39;re amusing
ethical or unethical unethical means of
persuading us they have a moral
component just in the kind of vision in
the aspiration of the good life that
they present to us and if you look into
the designed environment around us with
that kind of lens asking what is the
vision of the good life that our
products are designed present to us then
you often get the shivers because of how
little we expect of each other then of
how little we actually seem to expect of
our life and what the good life looks
like so that&#39;s a fourth question I&#39;d
like to leave you with what vision of
the good life do your designs convey and
speaking of design you notice that I
already sort of broaden the discussion
because it&#39;s not just persuasive
technology that we&#39;re talking about here
it&#39;s any piece of design that we put out
here in the world I don&#39;t know whether
you know the great communication
researcher pol vet Slovak who back in
the 60s made the argument we cannot not
communicate right even if we choose to
be silent we chose to be silent we&#39;re
communicating something by choosing to
be silent and in the same way that we
cannot not communicate we cannot not
persuade whatever we do or refrain from
doing whatever we put out there as a
piece of design into the world has a
persuasive component it tries to affect
people it puts a certain vision of the
good life out there in front of us which
is what pitiful for bake the Dutch
philosopher of Technology says right no
matter whether we as designers intended
or not we materialize morality we make
certain things harder and easier
to do we organize the existence of
people we put a certain vision of what
good or bad or normal or usual is in
front of people by everything we put out
there in the world even something as
innocuous as a set of school chairs is a
persuasive technology because it
presents and materializes a certain
vision of the good life a good life in
which teaching and learning and
listening is about one person teaching
the others listening in which is about
learning is done well sitting in which
you learn for yourself in which you&#39;re
not supposed to change these rules
because the chairs are fixed to the
ground and even something as innocuous
as a single design trip like this one by
arne occup ssin is a persuasive
technology because again it communicates
an idea of the good life a good life a
life that you say you as a designer
consent to by saying in a good life
goods are produced as sustainably or
unsustainably is this chair right
workers are treated as well or as badly
as the workers which we did that built
that chair good life is a life where
design is important because somebody
obviously took the time and spent the
money for that kind of well-designed
chair what tradition is important
because this is a traditional classic
and someone cared about this and where
there is something as conspicuous
consumption where it is okay and
normally it is spend a humongous amount
of money on such a chair to signal to
other people what your social status is
so these are the kinds of layers the
kind of questions I wanted to lead you
through today the question of what are
the intentions that you bring to bear
when you&#39;re designing something what are
the effects intended and unintended that
you&#39;re having what are the values you
using to judge those what are the
virtues the aspirations that you&#39;re
actually expressing in that and how does
that apply not just to persuasive
technology but to everything you design
do we stop there I don&#39;t think so I
think that all of these things are
eventually informed by the core of all
of this and this is nothing but life
itself why when the question of what the
good life is informs everything that we
design should we
stop at design and not ask ourselves how
does it apply to our own life why should
the lamb or the house be an art object
but not our life as michel foucault puts
it just to give you a practical example
of Buster Benson this is Buster setting
up a pull-up machine at the office of
this new startup habit labs where
they&#39;re trying to build up other
applications like health month for
people and why is he building up the
thing like this well here is the set of
axioms that have it laughs Buster
startup put up for themselves on how
they wanted to work together as a team
when they&#39;re building these applications
set of moral principles they set
themselves for working together and one
of them being we take care of our own
health and manager of our own burnout
because ultimately how can you ask
yourselves and how can you find an
answer on what vision of the good life
you want to convey and create with your
designs without asking the question what
vision of the good life do you yourself
want to live and with that I thank
