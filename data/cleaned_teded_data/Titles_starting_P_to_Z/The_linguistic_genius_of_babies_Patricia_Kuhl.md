I want you to take a look at this baby
what you&#39;re drawn to are her eyes and
the skin you love to touch but today I&#39;m
going to talk to you about something you
can&#39;t see what&#39;s going on up in that
little brain of hers the modern tools of
neuroscience are demonstrating to us
that what&#39;s going on up there is nothing
short of rocket science and what we&#39;re
learning is going to shed some light on
what the romantic writers and poets
described as the celestial openness of
the child&#39;s mind what we see here is a
mother in India and she&#39;s speaking coral
which is a newly discovered language and
she&#39;s talking to her baby what this
mother and the eight hundred people who
speak coral in the world understand that
it to preserve this language they need
to speak it to the babies and therein
lies a critical puzzle why is it that
you can&#39;t preserve a language by
speaking to you and I to the adults well
it&#39;s got to do with your brain what we
see here is that language has a critical
period for learning the way to read this
slide is to look at your age on the
horizontal axis we&#39;ve done that and
you&#39;ll see on the vertical your skill at
acquiring a second language the babies
and children are geniuses until they
turn seven and then there&#39;s a systematic
decline after puberty we fall off the
map no scientists dispute this curve but
laboratories all over the world are
trying to figure out why it works this
way work in my lab is focused on the
first critical period in development and
that is the period in which babies try
to master which sounds are used in their
language we think by studying how the
sounds are learned we&#39;ll have a model
for the rest of language and perhaps for
critical periods that may exist in
childhood for social emotional and
cognitive development so we&#39;ve been
studying the babies using a technique
that we&#39;re using all over the world and
the sounds of all languages the baby
sits on a
slap and we train them to turn their
heads when a sound changes like from A
to E if they do so that the appropriate
time the black box lights up and a panda
bear pounds a drum a six-month or adores
the task what have we learned well
babies all over the world are what I
like what I like to describe as citizens
of the world they can discriminate all
the sounds of all languages no matter
what country we&#39;re testing and what
language we&#39;re using and that&#39;s
remarkable because you and I can&#39;t do
that
we&#39;re culture-bound listeners we can
discriminate the sounds of our own
language but not those of foreign
languages so the question arises when do
those citizens of the world turn into
the language bound listeners that we are
and the answer before their first
birthdays what you see here is
performance on that head turn tasks for
babies tested in Tokyo and in the United
States here in Seattle as they listen to
raw and law sounds important to English
but not to Japanese so at six to eight
months the babies are totally equivalent
two months later something incredible
occurs the babies in the United States
are getting a lot better
babies in Japan are getting a lot worse
but both of those groups of babies are
preparing for exactly the language that
they are going to learn so the question
is what&#39;s happening during this critical
two-month period this is the critical
period for sound development but what&#39;s
going on up there so there are two
things going on the first is that the
babies are listening intently to us and
they&#39;re taking statistics as they listen
to us talk they&#39;re taking statistics so
listen to two mothers speaking motherese
the universal language we use when we
talk to kids first in English and then
in Japanese ah I love your big blue eyes
so pretty and nice Wow you know Thai
royal minute so stick it in could I uh
me during the production of speech when
babies listen what they&#39;re doing is
taking statistics on the language that
they hear and those distributions grow
and what we&#39;ve learned is
that babies are sensitive to the
statistics and the statistics of
Japanese and English are very very
different English has a lot of ours and
ELLs the distribution shows and the
distribution of Japanese is totally
different where we see a group of
intermediate sounds which is known as
the Japanese are so babies absorb the
statistics of the language and it
changes their brains it changes them
from the citizens of the world to the
culture bound listeners that we are but
we as adults are no longer absorbing
those statistics we&#39;re governed by the
representations in memory that were
formed early in development so what
we&#39;re seeing here is changing our models
of what the critical period is about
we&#39;re arguing from a mathematical
standpoint that the learning of language
material may slow down when our
distributions stabilized it&#39;s raising
lots of questions about bilingual people
bilinguals must keep two sets of
statistics in mind at once and flip
between them one after the other
depending on who they&#39;re speaking to so
we asked ourselves can the babies take
statistics on a brand new language and
we tested this by exposing American
babies who&#39;d never heard a second
language to Mandarin for the first time
during the critical period we knew that
when monolinguals were tested in Taipei
in Seattle on the Mandarin sounds they
showed the same pattern six eight months
they&#39;re totally equivalent two months
later something incredible happens but
the Taiwanese babies are getting better
not the American babies what we did was
expose American babies during this
period to Mandarin it was like having
mandarin relatives come and visit for a
month and move into your house and talk
to the babies for 12 sessions here&#39;s
what it looked like in the laboratory so
Xiao Xiang chichi that said &#39;i know the
Bujinkan me into the tin trip
they said attention don&#39;t shine me
hey a chair tied up
yeah so what have we done to their
little brains wait
we had to run a control group to make
sure that just coming into the
laboratory didn&#39;t improve your Mandarin
skills so a group of babies came in and
listen to English and we can see from
the graph that exposure to English
didn&#39;t improve their Mandarin but look
what happened to the babies exposed to
Mandarin for 12 sessions they were as
good as the babies in Taiwan who&#39;d been
listening for 10 and a half months what
it demonstrated is that babies take
statistics on a new language whatever
you put in front of them they&#39;ll take
statistics on but we wondered what role
the human being played in this learning
exercise so we ran another group of
babies in which the kids were get the
same dosage the same 12 sessions but
over a television set and another group
of babies who had just audio exposure
and looked at a teddy bear on the screen
what did we do to their brains what you
see here is the audio result no learning
whatsoever and the video result no
learning whatsoever it takes a human
being for babies to take their
statistics the social brain is
controlling when the babies are taking
their statistics we want to get inside
the brain and see this thing happening
as babies are in front of televisions as
opposed to in front of human beings
thankfully we have a new machine Magneto
and cephalo grafite to do this it looks
like a hairdryer from Mars but it&#39;s
completely safe completely non-invasive
and silent we&#39;re looking at millimetre
accuracy with regard to spatial and
millisecond accuracy using three hundred
and six squids these are superconducting
quantum interference devices to pick up
the magnetic fields that change as we do
our thinking we&#39;re the first in the
world to record babies in an emmy jima
sheen while they are
so this is little Emma she&#39;s a six month
er and she&#39;s listening to various
languages in the earphones that are in
her ears you can see she can move around
we&#39;re tracking her head with little
pellets in a cap so she&#39;s free to move
completely unconstrained it&#39;s a
technical tour de force what are we
seeing we&#39;re seeing the baby brain as
the way as the baby here is a word in
her language the auditory area is light
up and then subsequently areas
surrounding it that we think are related
to coherence getting the brain
coordinated with its different areas and
causality one brain area causing another
to activate we are embarking on a grand
and golden age of knowledge about
child&#39;s brain development we&#39;re going to
be able to see a child&#39;s brain as they
experience an emotion as they learn to
speak and read as they solve a math
problem as they have an idea and we&#39;re
going to be able to invent brain based
interventions for children who have
difficulty learning just as the poets
and writers described we&#39;re going to be
able to see I think that wondrous
openness utter and complete openness of
the mind of a child
in investigating the child&#39;s brain we&#39;re
going to uncover deep truths about what
it means to be human and in the process
we may be able to help keep our own
minds open to learning for our entire
lives thank you
you
