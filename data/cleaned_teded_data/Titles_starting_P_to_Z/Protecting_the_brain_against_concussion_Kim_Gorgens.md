so a funny thing happened on my way to
becoming a brilliant world-class
neuropsychologist I had a baby and
that&#39;s not to say I ever went on to
become a brilliant world-class
neuropsychologist sorry Ted ah but I did
go on to be a reasonably astute arguably
world-class worrier one of my
girlfriend&#39;s in graduate school Murray
said can I figured it out it&#39;s not that
you&#39;re more neurotic than everyone else
it&#39;s just that you&#39;re more honest about
how neurotic you are so in the spirit of
full disclosure I brought some pictures
to share oh I&#39;ll just say July
for safety water wheeze an inch of water
and then finally all suited up for the
90 minute drive to Copper Mountain so uh
you could get kind of a feel for this so
my baby Vander is 8 years old now and
despite being cursed with my athletic
inability he plays soccer he&#39;s
interested in playing football he wants
to learn how to ride a unicycle so why
would I worry because this is what I do
this is what I teach it&#39;s what I study
it&#39;s what I treat and I know that kids
get concussed every year in fact more
than 4 million people sustained a
concussion every year and these data are
just among kids under 14 who were seen
in emergency rooms and so when kids
sustained a concussion we talk about
them getting dinged or getting their
bell rung but what is it that we&#39;re
really talking about let&#39;s take a look
all right
Starsky and Hutch arguably yes ah so a
car accident 40 miles an hour into a
fixed barrier 35 G&#39;s a heavyweight boxer
punches you straight in the face 58 G&#39;s
in case you missed it well look again
so look to the right-hand side of the
screen would you say how many G&#39;s closed
72 would it be crazy to know a hundred
and three G&#39;s the average concussive
impact is 95 G&#39;s now when the kid on the
right doesn&#39;t get up right we know
they&#39;ve had a concussion but how about
the kid on the left or the athlete that
leaves the field of play how do we know
if he or she has sustained a concussion
how do we know that legislation that
would require they&#39;d be pulled from play
cleared for return to play applies to
them the definition of concussion
doesn&#39;t actually require a loss of
consciousness it requires only a change
in consciousness and that can be anyone
or a number of symptoms including
feeling foggy feeling dizzy hearing a
ringing in your ear being more impulsive
or hostile than usual so given all of
that and given how darn neurotic I am
how do I get any sleep at all because I
know our brains are resilient they&#39;re
designed to recover from an injury if
god forbid any of us left here tonight
and sustained a concussion
most of us would go on to fully recover
inside of a couple hours to a couple of
weeks but kids are more vulnerable to
brain injury in fact high school
athletes are three times more likely to
sustain catastrophic injuries relative
even to their college age peers and it
takes them longer to return to a
symptom-free baseline after that first
injury their risk for second injury is
exponentially greater from there their
risk for third injury greater still and
so on and here&#39;s the really alarming
part we don&#39;t fully understand the
long-term impact of multi
injuries you guys may be familiar with
this research is coming out of the NFL
in a nutshell this research suggests
that among retired NFL players with
three or more career concussions the
incidents of early onset dementing
disease is much greater than it is for
the general population so you&#39;ve all
seen that New York Times you&#39;ve seen it
what you may not be familiar with is
that this research was spearheaded by
NFL wives who said isn&#39;t it weird that
my 46 year old husband is forever losing
his keys isn&#39;t it weird that my 47 year
old husband is forever losing the car
isn&#39;t it weird that my 48 year old
has-been is forever losing his way home
in the car from the driveway so I may
have forgotten to mention that my son is
an only child so it&#39;s gonna be really
important that he be able to drive me
around someday so ah how do we guarantee
the safety of our kids how can we 100%
guarantee the safety of our kids let me
tell you what I&#39;ve come up with
if only my boys right there and he&#39;s
like she&#39;s not kidding
she&#39;s totally not kidding so uh in all
seriousness should my kid play football
should your kid play football I don&#39;t
know but I do know there are three
things you can do
the first study up you have to be
familiar with the issues we&#39;re talking
about today
there are some great resources out there
the CDC has a program heads up ATS at
CDC gov
is specific to concussion and kids the
second is a resource I&#39;m personally
really proud of we&#39;ve just rolled this
out in the last couple months Co kids
with brain injury this is a great
resource for student athletes teachers
parents professionals athletic and
coaching staff it&#39;s a great place to
start if you have questions the second
thing is speak up just two weeks ago a
bill introduced by Senator kefalas that
would have required athletes kids under
18 to wear a helmet when they&#39;re riding
their bike died in committee it died in
large part because it lacked constituent
buy-in it lacked stakeholder traction
now I&#39;m not here to tell you what kind
of legislation you should or shouldn&#39;t
support but I am gonna tell you that if
it matters to you your legislators need
to know that speak up also with coaching
staff ask about what kind of protective
equipment is available what&#39;s the budget
for protective equipment how old is it
may be offered a spearhead a fundraiser
to buy new gear which brings us to suit
up wear a helmet the only way to prevent
a bad outcome is to prevent that first
injury from happening recently one of my
graduate students Tom Tom said Kim I&#39;ve
decided to wear bike helmet way to class
and Tom knows that that little bit of
foam and a bike helmet can reduce the
g-force of impact by half now I thought
that it was because I have this too
compelling helmet crusade right this
epiphany of Tom&#39;s as it turns out it
occurred to Tom that a twenty dollar
helmet is a good way to protect a
hundred thousand dollar graduate
education so should Vander play football
I can&#39;t say no but I can guarantee that
every time he leaves the house that kids
wearing a helmet like to the car or at
school
so whether athletes scholar
overprotected kid neurotic mom or
otherwise here&#39;s my baby Vander
reminding you to mind your matter
you
