I want to start on us slightly somber
note 2007 five years ago my wife gets
diagnosed with breast cancer stage to be
now looking back the most harrowing part
of that experience was not just the
hospital visit these are very painful
for my wife understandably sell it is
not even the initial shock of knowing
that she had breast cancer just 39 years
old absolutely no history of cancer in
her family the most horrifying and
agonizing part of the whole experience
was we were making decisions after
decisions of her decisions that were
being thrust upon us should it be a
master to me should it be a lobectomy
should it be a more aggressive form of
treatment given that it was staged to be
with all the side effects or should it
be a less aggressive form of treatment
and these were being pressed upon us by
the doctors now you can ask this
question why would the doctors doing
this now a simplistic answer would be
the doctors are doing this because you
know they want to protect themselves
legally I think that is too simplistic
these are well-meaning doctors some of
them have gone on to become very good
friends they probably simply following
the wisdom that has come down the ages
this adage that when you&#39;re making
decisions especially decisions of
importance it&#39;s best to be in charge
it&#39;s best to be in control it&#39;s best to
be in the driver&#39;s seat and we were
certainly in the driver&#39;s seat making
all these decisions so let me tell you
some of you are being there it&#39;s the
most agonizing and harrowing experience
which got me thinking said is there any
validity to this this whole adage that
when you&#39;re making decisions it&#39;s best
to take the driver&#39;s seat be in charge
be in control or are there context where
we&#39;re far better off taking the
passenger seat and have someone else
drive for example a trusted financial
advisor could be a trusted dr. exactly
and since I was I study human
decision-making I said I&#39;m going to run
some studies to find some answers and
I&#39;m going to share one of these studies
with you today so imagine that all of
you are participant
in this study I&#39;m going to tell you that
what you&#39;re going to do in the study is
you&#39;re going to drink a cup of tea if
you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;ll tell you why
in a few seconds from now you are going
to solve a series of puzzles and i&#39;m
going to show you examples of these
puzzles in momentarily and the more
puzzles you solve the greater the
chances that you win some prizes now
what do you have to consume the deep why
because it makes a lot of sense in order
to solve these puzzles effectively if
you think about it your mind needs to be
in two states simultaneously right it
needs to be alert for which caffeine is
very good simultaneously it needs to be
calm not agitated calm for which
chamomile is very good now comes the
between-subject design the a be designed
the a/b testing so what I&#39;m going to do
is randomly assign you to one of two
groups so imagine that there&#39;s an
imaginary line out here so everyone here
will be group a everyone out here would
be Group B now for you folks what I&#39;m
going to do is I&#39;m going to show you
these two teas and I&#39;m asking you I can
go ahead and ask you to choose your team
so you can choose which your tea you
want where you doesn&#39;t write what is
your metal state ok I&#39;m going to chose
the caffeinated tea i&#39;m going to choose
the combatives you&#39;re going to be in
charge you&#39;re going to be in control
you&#39;re going to be in the tribal see you
folks i&#39;m going to show you these two
teas but you don&#39;t have a choice i&#39;m
going to give you one of these two teas
and keep in mind i&#39;m going to pick one
of these duties at random for you and
you know that so if you think about it
this is an extreme case scenario because
the real world whenever you are taking
the passenger seat very often the driver
is going to be someone you trust an
expert etc so there&#39;s an extreme case
scenario now you&#39;re all going to consume
the T so imagine that you&#39;re taking the
tree now we&#39;ll wait for you to finish
the tea will give you another five
minutes for the ingredient to have its
effects now you&#39;re going to have 30
minutes to solve 15 puzzles here&#39;s an
example of the puzzle you&#39;re going to
solve anyone in the audience want to
take a stab
whoa okay that&#39;s cool yeah so what we do
if we had you who will get the answer as
far as a participant we would have
calibrated the difficulty level of the
puzzles to your expertise because we
want these puzzles to be difficult these
are tricky puzzles because your first
instinct is to say chillin and then
you&#39;ll have to unstick yourself right so
these have been calibrated to your level
of expertise because we want this to be
difficult and tell you why momentarily
now here&#39;s our example anyone&#39;s much
more difficult yeah Wow okay so yeah so
this is again difficult you&#39;ll say
camber then you have to go make her and
all that and then you can unstuck
yourself okay so you have 30 minutes now
to solve these 15 puzzles now the
question we are asking here is in terms
of the outcome and comes with a number
of puzzles solved will you in the
driver&#39;s seat end up solving more
puzzles because you are in control you
could decide which T you would choose or
would you be better off in terms of the
number of puzzles solved and
systematically what we will shell across
a series of studies is that you the
passengers even though the tea was
picked for you at random we&#39;ll end up
solving more puzzles than you the
drivers will also observe another thing
and that is you folks not near solving
for your puzzles you&#39;re also putting
less juice into the task less effort
you&#39;re less persistent and so on how do
we know that but we have to objective
measures one is what is a time on
average or taking in attempting to solve
these puzzles you will spend less time
compared to you second you have 30
minutes to solve this are you taking the
entire 30 minutes are you giving up
before the 30 minutes elapsed you will
be more likely to give up before the 30
minute elapses come at you so you&#39;re
putting in less juice and therefore the
outcome fewer puzzles solved that now
brings us now do why does this happen
right and under what situations when
would we see this pattern of results
where the passenger is going to show
better more favorable outcomes
do the driver it all has to do with when
you face what I call the income it&#39;s an
acronym that stands for the nature of
the feedback you&#39;re getting after you
made the decision so if you think about
it in this particular puzzles pass it
could happen in investing in the stock
market very volatile out there it could
be in a medical situation the feedback
here is immediate you know the feedback
for the in solving the puzzles are not
right second it is negative they
remember the deck was stacked against
you in terms of the difficulty level of
these puzzles but this can happen in the
medical domain for example very early on
the treatment things are negative the
feedback before things become positive
right there happen in the stock market
volatile stock market getting the
negative feedback it is also immediate
and the feedback in all these cases as
concrete it&#39;s not ambiguous you know if
you solve the puzzles are not now the
added one apart from this immediacy
negative this concreteness now you have
a sense of agency you were responsible
for your decision so what do you do you
focus on the foregone option you say you
know what I should have chosen the other
key
that casts your decision in doubt
reduces the confidence you have the
decidua this is the confidence you have
in the performance performance in terms
of solving the puzzles and therefore
less juice into the task fewer puzzles
solve less favorable outcomes come back
to you folks and this can happen in the
medical domain if you think about it
right a patient of the driver&#39;s seat for
example unless Jews which means you know
you know keeping herself or himself less
physically fit physically active to
hasten the recovery process which is
what is often advocated you probably
wouldn&#39;t do that and therefore there are
times when you&#39;re facing the Inca when
the feedback there&#39;s going to be
immediate negative concrete and you have
the sense of agency where you&#39;re far
better off taking the passenger seat and
how someone else drive now I started off
on the somber note I want to finish up
on a more upbeat note it has now been
five years slightly more than five years
and the good news thank God is that is
the cancer is still in remission so it
all ends well but one thing I didn&#39;t
mention was that very early on into her
treatment my wife and I decided that we
will take the passenger seat and that
made so much of a difference in terms of
the peace of mind that came with that we
could focus on her recovery we let the
doctors make all the decisions take the
driver&#39;s seat thank
