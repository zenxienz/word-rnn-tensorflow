good morning I would like to discuss
with you your place in space now I&#39;m not
going to talk about black holes are
going to be no multiverses there will
not even be plunk time I&#39;m talking about
fundamental astronomy that lets us know
where we are in the cosmos our story
begins on earth many people you know are
from Earth including my father now my
father was in law school in 1940 I don&#39;t
want to shock anybody over here but he
didn&#39;t really like it
so he got a summer job working for the
US Navy on earth on Wake Island now Wake
Island is in the middle of Pacific Ocean
nowhere so my dad was working for a
contractor building an airstrip which is
still there on Wake Island and they had
a great time so this is the greatest
summer job you ever had but then in the
late fall of 1941 December 7th Wake
Island was bombed same day as Pearl
Harbor and many other Pacific Ocean
targets my father and his comrades
fought back for two weeks and they shot
down at least two Japanese bombers every
day for two weeks but they the Japanese
Navy eventually showed up with foe
Atilla many ships and they captured
everybody on Christmas Eve my dad wrote
in his diary saddest day of my life
while they were taken to China some
place and my dad was in prison camp for
almost four years 44 months longer than
anyone else from the United States and
he had very dark skies at night they had
no electricity and the Japanese military
confiscated all their jewelry and
watches and so on so they had no way to
tell time so the family myth is my dad
would tell time by sticking a shovel
handle in the dirt and watching the
shadow he watched the shadows of sticks
and apparently they would tell the guard
what day it was
when it was time to eat lunch and he was
also the family myth able to infer when
you know the time of year they&#39;re able
to figure out their latitude so this guy
who my dad said wasn&#39;t even this tall
was able to crawl through a vent in this
train car and get back to the east coast
of China and make it all the way to the
United States and tell everybody what
happened because these guys essentially
disappeared I mean I don&#39;t know why they
didn&#39;t tweet where they were just or use
Facebook but eventually the deal is my
dad lived through it and he got back to
the states he married his college
sweetheart Here I am along with my older
brother and sister and through all this
my father became fascinated with
sundials so yes he created the well
known sand dial which you take to the
beach so you don&#39;t have to get sand in
your watch Oh everybody needs one
believe me and then he wrote articles
for the Washington DC area newspapers
and he eventually wrote a book about
sundials and that&#39;s when he was given a
lifetime membership in the North
American sundial Society anybody now
ecology does tell you there&#39;s a lot of
CFO&#39;s who chief financial officers a lot
of operating there&#39;s a lot of
accountants and you know how the
accountants can party that is crazy yeah
well let me tell you when you&#39;re with
the sundial people it is nuts man I mean
everybody&#39;s
it&#39;s moving look it&#39;s moving so so I of
course was a rebellious teenager and so
on but I did notice that last summer I
brought out one of the old sand aisles
it seemed to still work just fine and
someone I know converted a conventional
pizza box into a polar sundial now this
might be evidence of a Saudi sundial
obsessive disorder but I&#39;m fine now I&#39;m
fine
I could quit if I wanted I just don&#39;t
want to that&#39;s all so I got invited to a
meeting many years ago at Cornell
University and they had this thing this
is the test pattern for the cameras that
were going to Mars this is the
photometric calibration target and I
think you can see their color coupons
that you get the colors right and there
are three gray rings of different values
and so they were casting a shadow with
this little metal post so you could look
at the color of the Martian sky now if
you look at the at a shadow on earth
with something very white you&#39;ll see
it&#39;s blue just a little bit from the
Earth&#39;s sky some in this meeting and I
go you guys we got to turn the
photometric calibration target into a
sundial and they&#39;re looking at me know
you guys would be cool we can reckon
time on another world it&#39;ll be like
speaking Klingon except it&#39;ll be real
and so the head guy Steve Squyres said
okay so my friends there are two
sundials on Mars while we&#39;re here so
here&#39;s what I want you to do when you go
to Mars next time and you&#39;re standing
there you got to take some food and
water at 687 Earth days you will see the
Sun make this pattern through the sky as
the year goes on if you do it on earth
you will see this pattern that&#39;s I
started on the second of March
it&#39;ll go north and this pattern is
called the analemma
the NLM is own Latin word that means the
pedestal of a
dial so what I want you guys to do is to
build one of these and so what we have
done if you go to our website Planetary
org will find the instructions for
laying out the lines and getting the
hours right for your sundial anywhere in
the world you can furnish it anything
that&#39;s not on the dial to tell time is
it&#39;s furniture you can furnish it we
hear some sailboats and anchors and
here&#39;s the traditional latitude and
longitude and it&#39;s a ping-pong ball is
the gnomon because ping-pong balls are
available anywhere in the world so we
did this back in 2004 when the Spirit
and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars
and people all over the world built
these but those days webcams were kind
of a hassle this year we&#39;re hoping it
will be really cool so here&#39;s I&#39;m
telling you almost everybody has
observed the Sun go up and down as the
year goes on in the sky very few of us
have heard the word analemma
yet we all depend on it you go to office
supply stores you get your calendars
with the kittens and the puppies and the
firefighters with no shirts on and all
of that is figured out we had a leap day
this year all of that is figured out by
knowing intimately our relationship to
the Sun knowing intimately our place in
space so I submit to you my friends if
you take the time you can dare I say it
change the world thank you all very much
thank you
