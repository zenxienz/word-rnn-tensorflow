alright so like all good stories this
starts a long long time ago when there
was basically nothing so here is a
complete picture of the universe about
14 not billion years ago all energy is
concentrated into a single point of
energy for some reason it explodes and
you begin to get these things so you&#39;re
now about 14 billion years under this
and these things expand and expand and
expand into these giant galaxies and you
get trillions of them and within these
galaxies you get these enormous dust
clouds and I want you to pay particular
attention to the three little prongs in
the center of this picture if you take a
close up of those they look like this
and what you&#39;re looking at is columns of
dust where there&#39;s so much dust by the
way the scale of this is a trillion
vertical miles and what&#39;s happening is
there&#39;s so much dust it comes together
and it fuses that ignites a
thermonuclear reaction and so what
you&#39;re watching is the birth of stars
these are stars being born out of here
when enough stars come out they create a
galaxy this one happens to be a
particularly important galaxy because
you are here and as you take a close-up
of this galaxy you find a relatively
normal not particularly interesting
start by the way you&#39;re now about
two-thirds of the way into this story so
this star doesn&#39;t even appear until
about two thirds away in this story and
then what happens is there&#39;s enough dust
left over that it doesn&#39;t ignite into a
star it becomes a planet and this is
about a little over four billion years
ago and soon thereafter there&#39;s enough
material left over that you get a
primordial soup and that creates life
and life starts to expand and expand and
expand until it goes couplet
now the really strange thing is life
goes kaput not once not twice but five
times so almost all life on earth is
wiped out about five times and as you&#39;re
thinking about that what happens is you
get more and more complexity more and
more stuff to build new things with and
we don&#39;t appear until about ninety-nine
point nine six percent of the time into
this story just to put ourselves in our
ancestors in perspective so within that
context there&#39;s two theories of the case
as to why we&#39;re all here the first
theory of the case is that&#39;s all she
wrote right under that theory we are the
be-all and end-all of all creation and
the reason for trillions of galaxies six
dillians of planets is to create
something that looks like that and
something that looks like that and
that&#39;s the purpose of the universe and
then it flatlines it doesn&#39;t get any
better
the only question you might want to ask
yourself is could that be just mildly
arrogant and if it is and particularly
given the fact that we came very close
to extinction there were only about
2,000 of our species left a few more
weeks without rain we would have never
seen any of these
so maybe you have to think about a
second theory if the first one isn&#39;t
good enough second theory is could we
upgrade well why would one ask a
question like that because there have
been at least 29 upgrades so far of
humanoids so it turns out that we have
upgraded we&#39;ve upgraded time and again
and again and it turns out that we keep
discovering upgrades we found this one
last year we found another one last
month and as you&#39;re thinking about this
you might also ask the question so why a
single human species wouldn&#39;t it be
really odd if you went to Africa and
Asia and Antarctica and found exactly
the same bird particularly given that we
coexisted at the same time with at least
eight other versions of humanoid at the
same time on this planet so the normal
state of affairs is not to have just a
homo sapiens the normal state of affairs
is to have various versions of humans
walking around and if that is the normal
state of affairs then you might ask
yourself all right so if we wanted to
create something else how big does a
mutation have to be well svante paabo
has the answer the difference between
humans in the and earth all is point
zero zero four percent of gene code
that&#39;s how big the difference is one
species to another this explains most
contemporary political debates
but as you&#39;re thinking about this one of
the interesting things is how small
these mutations are and where they take
place difference human and earth all is
sperm and testes smell and skin and
those are the specific genes that differ
from one to the other so very small
changes can have a big impact and as
you&#39;re thinking about this we&#39;re
continuing to mutate so about 10,000
years ago by the Black Sea we had one
mutation in one gene which led to blue
eyes and this is continuing and
continuing and continuing and as it
continues one of the things that&#39;s going
to happen this year is we&#39;re going to
discover the first 10,000 human genomes
because it&#39;s gotten cheap enough to do
the gene sequencing and when we find
these we may find differences and by the
way this is not a debate that we&#39;re
ready for because we have really misused
the science in this in the 1920s we
thought there were major differences
between people that was partly based on
Francis Galton&#39;s work he was Darwin&#39;s
cousin but the US the Carnegie Institute
Stanford oh no American neurological
association took this really far that
got exported and was really miss used in
fact it lets some absolute horrendous
treatment of human beings so since the
1940s we&#39;ve been saying there are no
differences we are all identical we&#39;re
going to know what year end of that is
true and as we think about that we&#39;re
actually beginning to find things like
do you have an ace gee why would that
matter because nobody&#39;s ever climbed an
8,000 meter peak without oxygen that
doesn&#39;t have an H gene and if you want
to get more specific about a 577 our
genotype well it turns out that every
male Olympic power athlete ever tested
carries at least one of these variants
if that is true it leads to some very
complicated questions for the London
Olympics three options do you want the
Olympics to be a showcase for really
hard-working mutants
option number two why don&#39;t we play it
like golf or sailing because you have
one and you don&#39;t have 1 i&#39;ll give you a
tenth of a second head start version
number three because this is a naturally
occurring gene and you&#39;ve got it and you
didn&#39;t pick the right parents you get
the right to upgrade three different
options if these differences are the
difference between olympic medal and a
non-olympic mountain and it turns out
that as we discover these things we
human beings really like to change how
we look how we act what our bodies do
and we had about 10.2 million plastic
surgery the united states except that
with the technologies that are coming
online today today&#39;s Corrections
deletions augmentations and enhancements
are going to seem like child&#39;s play you
already saw the work by Tony etawah on
Ted but this ability to start filling
things like inkjet cartridges with cells
or allowing us to print skin organs and
a whole series of other body parts and
as these technologies go forward you
know you keep seeing this you keep
seeing us you keep seeing things two
thousand human genome sequence and it
seems like nothing&#39;s happening until it
does and we may just be in some of these
weeks and as you&#39;re thinking about you
know these two guys sequencing the human
genome in two thousand and the public
project sequencing the human genome in
two thousand then you don&#39;t hear a lot
till you hear about an experiment last
year in China where they take skin cells
from this mouse put four chemicals on it
turn those skin cells into stem cells
what the stem cells grow and create a
full copy of that Mouse that&#39;s a big
deal
because in essence what it means is you
can take a cell which is a pluripotent
stem cell which is like a skier at the
top of a mountain and those two skiers
become too pluripotent stem cells 4 8 16
and then it gets so crowded after 16
divisions that those cells have to
differentiate so they go down one side
of the mountain they go down another and
as they pick that these become bone and
then they pick another Road and these
become platelets and these became
macrophages and these become T cells but
it&#39;s really hard once you ski down to
get back up unless of course if you have
a ski lift and what those four chemicals
do is they take any cell and take it way
back up the mountain so it can become
any body part and as you think of that
what it means is potentially you can
rebuild a full copy of any organism out
of any one of its cells that turns out
to be a big deal because now you can
take not just mouse cells but you can
take human skin cells and turn them into
human stem cells and then what they did
in October is they took skin cells turn
them into stem cells and begin to turn
that into liver cells so in theory you
could grow any organ from any one of
your cells here&#39;s a second experiment if
you could photocopy your body maybe you
also want to take your mind and one of
the things you saw at Ted about a year
and a half ago was this guy and he gave
a wonderful technical talk using
professor at MIT but in essence what he
said is you can take retroviruses which
get inside brain cells of mice you can
tag them with proteins that light up
when you light them and you can map the
exact pathways when a mouse sees feels
touches remembers loves and then you can
take a fiber optic cable and light up
some of the same things
and by the way as you do this you can
image it in two colors which means you
can download this information as binary
code directly into a computer so what&#39;s
the bottom line on that it&#39;s not
completely inconceivable that someday
you&#39;ll be able to download your own
memories maybe into a new body and maybe
you can upload other people&#39;s memories
as well and this might have just one or
two small ethical political moral
implications just a thought here&#39;s the
kind of questions that are becoming
interesting questions for philosophers
for governing people for economists for
scientists because these technologies
are moving really quickly and as you
think about it let me close with an
example of the brain the first place
where you would expect to see enormous
evolutionary pressure today both because
of the inputs which are becoming massive
and because of the plasticity of the
organ is the brain do we have any
evidence that that is happening well
let&#39;s take a look at something like
autism incidents per thousand here&#39;s
what it looks like in two thousand
here&#39;s what it looks like in 2002-2006
2008 here&#39;s the increase in less than a
decade and we still don&#39;t know why this
is happening what we do know is
potentially the brain is reacting a
hyper reactive hyperplastic way and
creating individuals that are like this
and this is only one of the conditions
that&#39;s out there you&#39;ve also got people
who are extraordinarily smart people who
can remember everything they&#39;ve seen in
their lives people have got synesthesia
people got schizophrenia got all kinds
of stuff going on out there and we still
don&#39;t understand how and why this is
happening but one question you might
want to ask is are we seeing a rapid
evolution of the brain and of how we
process data because when you think of
how much data is coming into our brains
we&#39;re trying to take in as much
data in a day as people used to take it
in a lifetime and as you&#39;re thinking
about this there&#39;s four theories as to
why this might be going on plus a whole
series of others I don&#39;t have a good
answer there really needs to be more
research on these one option is a fast
food fetish there is beginning to be
some evidence that obesity and diet have
something to do with gene modifications
which may or may not have an impact on
how the brain of an infant works a
second option is the sexy geek option
these conditions are highly rare but
what&#39;s beginning to happen is because
these geeks are all getting together
because they are highly qualified for
computer programming and it is highly
remunerated as well as other very
detail-oriented tasks that they are
concentrating geographically and finding
like-minded mates so this is the sort of
mating hypothesis of these genes
reinforcing one another in these
structures the third is is too much
information we&#39;re trying to process so
much stuff that some people get
synesthetic and just have huge pipes and
remember everything other people get
hyper sensitive the amount of
information other people react with
various psychological conditions or
reactions to this information or maybe
it&#39;s chemicals but when you see an
increase of that order of magnitude in a
condition either you&#39;re not measuring it
right or there&#39;s something going on very
quickly and it may be evolution in real
time here&#39;s the bottom line what I think
we are doing is we&#39;re transitioning as a
species and I didn&#39;t think this when
Steve Collins and I started writing
together I think we&#39;re transitioning
into a home level udhas that for better
or worse is not just a hominid this
conscious of his or her environment it&#39;s
a hominid that&#39;s beginning to directly
and deliberately control
evolution of its own species of bacteria
of plants of animals and I think that&#39;s
such an order of magnitude change that
your grandkids or your great grand kids
may be a species very different from you
thank you very much
you
