Me, myself, and I.
You may be tempted to use 
these words interchangeably
because they all refer to the same thing,
but in fact, each one has a specific role
in a sentence.
&quot;I&quot; is a subject pronoun,
&quot;me&quot; is an object pronoun,
and &quot;myself&quot; is a reflexive
or intensive pronoun.
So what does that reveal about
where each word belongs?
Let&#39;s start with the difference
between subject and object.
Imagine the subject 
as the actor in a sentence
and the object as the word
that is acted upon.
&quot;I invited her but she invited me.&quot;
The object can also be 
the object of a preposition.
&quot;She danced around me, 
while he shimmied up to me.&quot;
In some languages, like Latin and Russian,
most nouns have different forms
that distinguish subjects from objects.
However, in English, 
that&#39;s only true of pronouns.
But so long as you know how to distinguish
subjects from objects,
you can figure out what belongs where.
And when you encounter 
a more complicated sentence,
say one that involves 
multiple subjects or objects,
and you&#39;re not sure 
whether to use &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me,&quot;
just temporarily eliminate 
the other person,
and once again distinguish 
subject from object.
Here&#39;s another.
You wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;Me heard gossip,&quot;
but sub in &quot;I&quot; and you&#39;re good to go.
Then what about &quot;myself?&quot;
This grand character is often substituted
for &quot;me&quot; and &quot;I&quot;
because it seems more impressive.
&quot;Please tell Jack or myself&quot; 
may sound elegant,
but in fact, &quot;me&quot; 
is the right pronoun here.
So where should you use &quot;myself&quot;?
In its function as a reflexive pronoun,
&quot;myself&quot; only works 
if it&#39;s the object of a sentence
whose subject is &quot;I.&quot;
&quot;I consider myself the most important
pronoun at this year&#39;s party.&quot;
&quot;Myself&quot; can also add emphasis
as an intensive pronoun.
&quot;I, myself, have heard others agree.&quot;
The sentence works without it,
but that extra pronoun gives it oomph.
To check if &quot;myself&quot; belongs 
in a sentence,
simply ensure that there&#39;s also an &quot;I&quot;
that it&#39;s reflecting or intensifying.
So that&#39;s &quot;me,&quot; &quot;myself,&quot; and &quot;I,&quot;
ever ready to represent 
you, yourself, and you.
