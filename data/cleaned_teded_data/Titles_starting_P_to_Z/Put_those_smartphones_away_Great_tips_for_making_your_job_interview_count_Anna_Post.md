you
manners
you&#39;ve got job interview etiquette out
there you&#39;ve got internship interview
etiquette out there and you all might be
thinking why are we here today to talk
at all about etiquette for job
interviews well when you think about it
an interview is a conversation with
somebody that might just be the most
life-changing conversation you ever have
so no pressure right it&#39;s okay
couple of reasons why I do think that
this is really important number one this
is something that can really set you
apart from the crowd and we all know
that there&#39;s a lot of job applicants out
there right now number two it&#39;s expected
of you interviewers are going to be
looking for the things we&#39;re about to
talk about and frankly none of these
things we&#39;re going to talk about should
be a reason that you don&#39;t get a job for
which you have experience and
qualifications to do and lastly it&#39;s a
really great chance to show the respect
and the interest and the appreciation
you have for the opportunity to
interview so there&#39;s six things that I
want all of you to know today about
interview etiquette so here we go number
one prepare prepare more than you think
you need to do okay and prepare outloud
by the way this might sound kind of
silly but you&#39;re going to do this in the
shower when you&#39;re walking the dog maybe
when you&#39;re in the car you can do this
with a friend practice hearing yourself
say things out loud like your strengths
or maybe answering questions that you
think you might be asked in an interview
this is going to get you comfortable
hearing yourself say this kind of stuff
out loud and that comfort is going to
translate into confidence when you&#39;re
actually in the interview okay so number
two dress up a notch okay a notch from
what well it&#39;s not always about being
really fancy you want to be appropriate
to whoever you&#39;re visiting so if you
don&#39;t know it&#39;s okay to call a
receptionist or Human Resources HR and
find out what the normal attire is the
place you&#39;re going in to is a great way
to show that you value the culture that
you&#39;re entering into number three be on
time no big shocker
right I heard a story about a guy really
qualified candidate at a major tax
company and he was nine minutes late for
his interview and I know that number was
nine because that&#39;s how much this
company cared about timeliness I&#39;ll tell
you something he didn&#39;t get the job he
walked in and the interview sounded like
this we really wanted to hire you but we
just can&#39;t you were late we&#39;re sorry
here&#39;s the thing I think it&#39;s a great
idea when you go in for a job or
internship interview to do a dry run
find out how long that commute will take
you to get there so that you know number
four the handshake okay now you guys
have all done handshakes I know that so
you know that eye contact is really
important way to show acknowledgement
recognition and confidence you smile so
that you look at ease so that you are
welcoming the handshake itself right you
want a really complete handshake
none of this sort of limp fish stuff
that leaves you wanting to wipe your
hands off afterwards some people talk
about having a really strong handshake
right which you don&#39;t want though is
that crushing handshake here nobody
wants that nobody likes getting one of
those either then there&#39;s my favorite I
call this one the glad-hand right this
is when you shake somebody&#39;s hand and
you&#39;re like yeah nice to meet you
and you&#39;re using both of them that&#39;s for
the politicians skip that one now
there&#39;s something that you might not
know about handshakes though and I want
you all to do this with me right now and
that is to stand up so everybody in the
audience or if you&#39;re at home you can do
this there stand up
beautiful you do that absolutely
beautifully this is one of the best ways
that you can show your respect you&#39;re
meeting somebody at their eye level this
is fantastic you guys can sit down again
beautifully done number five this is
about your smartphone or your cell phone
or anything else that you&#39;ve got with
you I love mine you love yours but in
the interview you&#39;re going to want to
put them away it&#39;s like they don&#39;t even
exist don&#39;t want to see it don&#39;t want to
hear it why here&#39;s the deal you know I
like to know the reason why somebody&#39;s
asking me to do something and here it is
giving our full attention to somebody
and our interviewer deserves that is one
of the best ways that we can show our
respect for that person when you divide
that attention or
distracted away by a device it
diminishes the respect that you&#39;re
paying to them I think that&#39;s why people
really feel this one this is a big one
for people number six
thank you notes all right how many
people here raise your hands I&#39;ve ever
written a handwritten thank-you note
before awesome I knew it all right now
of those of you out there who have
already interviewed for a job or an
internship how many of you written a
handwritten note for that opportunity
this is a fantastic chance to really
shine this is a great opportunity now
here&#39;s the thing I&#39;m not just about
handwritten notes I&#39;m all for email -
that&#39;s great so you can send one of each
your email is going to sound like this I
just dropped a note in the mail I wanted
to thank you right away for the
opportunity to interview you&#39;ll probably
say a couple things about you know
something unique to the interview maybe
a little follow up these don&#39;t have to
be really long they don&#39;t have to be
identical either they can be kind of
close but don&#39;t copy them and send one
to each person that you met with in the
interview so those are the six things
that I want you to know about job
interviews to prepare more than you
think and to prepare out loud to dress
up a notch to be on time to have a great
handshake that you stand up for to have
your cell phone away not a distraction
and just send thank you afterwards
handwritten and email to everybody that
you meet with but here&#39;s the thing it
can sometimes also be about nerves so
before you go in do this with me right
now really big smile I learned this
trick when I started speaking and it&#39;s a
great one to put you at ease so I want
to thank you guys all and wish you a lot
of success
you
