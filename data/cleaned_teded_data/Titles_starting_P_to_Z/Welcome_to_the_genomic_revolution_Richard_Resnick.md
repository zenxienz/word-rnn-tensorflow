ladies and gentlemen I present to you
the human genome chromosome one top left
bottom right are the sex chromosomes
women have two copies of that big X
chromosome men have the X and of course
that small copy of the Y sorry boys but
it&#39;s just a tiny little thing that makes
you different so if you zoom in on this
genome then what you see of course is
this double helix structure the code
alive spelled out with these for
biochemical letters or we call them
bases write AC G&amp;T how many are there in
the human genome three billion is that a
big number well everybody can throw
around big numbers but in fact if I were
to place one base on each pixel of this
1280 x 800 resolution screen we would
need 3,000 screens to take a look at the
genome so it&#39;s really quite big and
perhaps because of its size a group of
people all by the way with Y chromosomes
decided that they would want to sequence
it
and so 15 years actually in about four
billion dollars later the genome was
sequenced and published in 2003 the
final version was published and they
keep working on it that was all done on
a machine it looks like this costs about
a dollar for each base very slow way of
doing it well folks I&#39;m here to tell you
that the world has completely changed
and none of you know about it so now
what we do is we take a genome we make
maybe 50 copies of it we cut all those
copies up into little 50 base reads and
then we sequence them massively parallel
and then we bring that into software and
we reassemble it and we tell you what
the story is and so just to give you a
picture of what this looks like the
Human Genome Project three Giga bases
right one run on one of these modern
machines 200 giga bases in a week and
that 200 is going to change to 600 this
summer and there&#39;s no sign of this pay
slowing so the price of a base to
sequence a base has fallen a hundred
million times that&#39;s the equivalent of
you filling up your car with gas in 1998
waiting until 2011 and now you can drive
to Jupiter and back twice
world population PC placements the
archive of all the medical literature
Moore&#39;s Law the old way of sequencing
and here&#39;s all the new stuff guys this
is a log scale you don&#39;t typically see
lines that go up like that right so the
worldwide capacity to sequence human
genomes is something like fifty to a
hundred thousand human genomes this year
and we know this based on the machines
that are being placed this is expected
to double triple or maybe quadruple year
over year for the foreseeable future in
fact there&#39;s one lab in particular that
represents twenty percent of all that
capacity it&#39;s called the Beijing
genomics Institute the Chinese are
absolutely winning this race to the new
moon by the way what does it mean for
medicine so women aged 37 she presents
with stage 2 estrogen receptor positive
breast cancer she is treated with
surgery chemotherapy and radiation she
goes home two years later she comes back
with stage 3c ovarian cancer
unfortunately treated again with surgery
and chemotherapy comes back three years
later at age 42 with more ovarian cancer
more chemotherapy six months later she
comes back with acute myeloid leukemia
she goes into respiratory failure and
dies eight days later so first the way
in which this woman was treated in as
little as 10 years will look like
bloodletting and it&#39;s because of people
like my colleague rick wilson at the
genome institute at Washington
University who decided to take a look at
this woman post-mortem any sequence he
took skin cells healthy skin and
cancerous bone marrow and he sequenced
the whole genome to both of them right
in a couple weeks no big deal right and
then he compared those two genomes and
software and what he found among other
things was a deletion a 2,000 base
deletion across three billion bases
right in a particular gene called tp53
if you have this deleterious mutation in
this gene your ninety percent likely to
get cancer in your life so unfortunately
this doesn&#39;t help this woman but it does
have severe a profound if you will
implications to her family right I mean
if they have the same mutation and they
get this genetic tests and they
understand it then they can go and get
regular screens and they can
cancer early and potentially live a
significantly longer life let me
introduce you now to the beery twins
diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age
of two their mom is a very brave woman
who didn&#39;t believe it the symptoms
weren&#39;t matching up and through some
heroic efforts and a lot of internet
searching she was able to convince the
medical community that in fact they had
something else what they had was dopa
responsive dystonia and so they were
given l-dopa and their symptoms did
improve but they weren&#39;t totally
asymptomatic significant problems
remained turns out the gentleman in this
picture is a guy named Joe beery who was
lucky enough to be the CIO of a company
called life technologies they&#39;re one of
the two companies that makes these
massive whole genome sequencing tools
and so what he did was he got his kids
sequenced and what they found was a
series of mutations in a gene called SPR
which is responsible for producing
serotonin among other things so on top
of l-dopa they gave these kids a
serotonin precursor drug and they&#39;re
effectively normal now guys this would
never have happened without whole genome
sequencing and at the time this was a
few years ago will cost a hundred
thousand today it&#39;s ten thousand next
year at 2000 the year after its one
hundred give or take a year that&#39;s how
fast this is moving so here&#39;s little
nick likes batman and squirt guns and
turns out nick shows up at the
children&#39;s hospital with this distended
belly like a famine victim and it&#39;s not
that he&#39;s not eating it&#39;s that when he
eats his intestine basically opens up
and feces spill out into his gut so a
hundred surgeries later right he looks
at his mom and says mom please pray for
me I&#39;m in so much pain his pediatrician
happens to have a background in clinical
genetics and he has no idea what&#39;s going
on but he says let&#39;s get this kid&#39;s
genome sequence and what they find is a
single point mutation in a gene
responsible for controlling program cell
death so the theory is that he&#39;s having
some immunological reaction to what&#39;s
going on to the food essentially right
and that&#39;s a natural reaction which
causes some programmed cell death but
the gene that regulates that down is
broken and so this informs among other
things of course a treatment for bone
marrow transplant which he undertakes
and after nine months of grueling
recovery he&#39;s now eating steak with a
one sauce the prospect of using the
genome as a universal diagnostic is upon
us today today it&#39;s here and what it
means for all of us
is that everybody in this room could
live in extra 5 10 20 years just because
of this one thing which is a fantastic
story unless you think about humanity&#39;s
footprint on the planet and our ability
to keep up food production so it turns
out at the very same technology is also
being used to grow new lines of corn
wheat soy bean and other crops that are
highly tolerant of drought a flood of
paths and pesticides now look as long as
we continue to increase the population
we&#39;re going to have to continue to grow
and eat genetically modified foods and
that&#39;s the only position that I&#39;ll take
today unless there&#39;s anybody in the
audience that would like to volunteer to
stop eating none not one this is a
typewriter a staple of every desktop for
decades right and in fact the typewriter
was essentially deleted by this thing
and then more general versions of word
processors came about but ultimately it
was a disruption on top of a disruption
it was Bob Metcalfe inventing the
ethernet and the connection of all these
computers that fundamentally changed
everything right and suddenly we had
Netscape and we had yahoo and we had
indeed the entire com bubble not to
worry though that was quickly rescued by
the ipod Facebook and indeed Angry Birds
look this is where we are today this is
the genomic revolution today this is
where we are okay so what I&#39;d like for
you to consider is what does it mean
when these dots don&#39;t represent the
individual basis of your genome but the
connected genomes all across the planet
so I just recently had to buy life
insurance and I was required to answer a
I have never had a genetic test be I&#39;ve
had one here you go and see I&#39;ve had one
and I&#39;m not telling thankfully I was
able to answer a and I say that honestly
in case my life insurance agent is
listening but what would have happened
if I had said C consumer applications
for genomics they will flourish you want
to see whether you&#39;re genetically
compatible with your girlfriend sure DNA
sequencing on your iPhone there&#39;s an app
for that personalized genomic massage
anyone there&#39;s already a lab today that
tests for allele 334 of the AVP are one
gene the so called cheating gene so
anybody who&#39;s who&#39;s here today with your
significant other just turn over to them
and swab their mouth sent it to the lab
and you&#39;ll know for sure do you really
want to elect a president whose genome
suggests cardiomyopathy now think of it
it&#39;s 2016 and the leading candidate
releases not only her four years of back
tax returns but also her personal genome
and it looks really good and then she
challenges all of her competitors to do
the same do you think that&#39;s not going
to happen you think it would help John
McCain
how many people in the audience have the
last name Resnick like me raise your
hand anybody nobody typically there&#39;s
one or two so my father&#39;s father is one
of 10 Resnick brothers I&#39;ll hated each
other right and they all move to
different parts of the planet and so
it&#39;s likely that I&#39;m related to every
Resnick that I ever meet but I don&#39;t
know so imagine if my genome were
de-identified sitting in software right
and a third cousins genome was also
sitting there and there was software
that could compare these two and make
these associations not hard to imagine
my company on software that does this
right now and so imagine one more thing
that that software is able to ask both
parties for mutual consent would you be
willing to meet your third cousin and if
we both say yes voila welcome to
chromosomally linkedin right now this is
probably a good thing right a bigger
clan gatherings and so on but maybe it&#39;s
a bad thing as well how many fathers in
the room raise your hands okay so it
just turns experts think that one to
three percent of you are not actually
the father of your child look
these genomes these 23 chromosomes they
don&#39;t in any way represent the quality
of our relationships or the nature of
our society at least not yet and like
any new technology it&#39;s really in
humanity&#39;s hands to wield it for the
betterment of mankind or not and so I
urge you all to wake up and to tune in
and to influence the genomic revolution
that&#39;s happening all around you thank
you
