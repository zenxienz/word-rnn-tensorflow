so since I was here last no.6 we
discovered that global climate change is
turning out to be a pretty serious issue
so we covered that fairly extensively in
skeptic magazine we investigate all
kinds of scientific and quasi scientific
controversies but it turns out we don&#39;t
really have to worry about any of this
because the world&#39;s gonna end in 2012
another update you will call excite
introduced you guys to the Quadro
tracker it&#39;s a like a water dowsing
device it&#39;s just a hollow piece of
plastic with an antenna that swivels
around and you walk around and it points
to things like if you&#39;re looking for
marijuana and students lockers it&#39;ll you
know like point right to some somebody
I&#39;m sorry this particular one that was
given to me
finds golf balls especially if you&#39;re at
a golf course and you check under enough
bushes well under the category of what&#39;s
the harm of silly stuff like this this
device the a de 651 was sold to the
Iraqi government for forty thousand
dollars apiece it&#39;s just like this one
completely worthless in which it
allegedly worked by electrostatic
magnetic ion attraction which translates
to pseudo scientific baloney would be
the nice word which you string together
a bunch of words that sound good but it
does absolutely nothing in this case
allowing a trespass points allowing
people to go through because your little
tracker device said they were okay
actually cost lives so there is a danger
to pseudoscience and believing in this
sort of thing so what I want to talk
about today is belief I want to believe
and and you do too and in fact I think
my thesis here is that belief is the
natural state of things it is the
default option we just believe we
believe all sorts of things belief is
natural disbelief skepticism science is
not natural it&#39;s it&#39;s more difficult
it&#39;s uncomfortable to not believe things
so like Fox Mulder on x-files who wants
to believe in UFOs what we all do and
the reason for that is because we are
we have a belief engine in our brains
essentially we are pattern-seeking
primates we connect the dots a is
connected to B B is connected to C and
sometimes they really is connected to B
and that&#39;s called association learning
we find patterns we make those
connections whether it&#39;s Pavlov&#39;s dog
here associating the sound of the Bell
with the food and then he celebrates to
the sound of the Bell or whether it&#39;s
thus Canarian rat and which he&#39;s having
an association between his behavior and
a reward for it and therefore he repeats
the behavior in fact what Skinner
discovered is that if you put a pigeon
in a box like this and he has to press
one of these two keys and he tries to
figure out what the pattern is and you
give them a little reward in the hopper
box there if you just randomly assign
rewards such that there is no pattern
they will figure out any kind of pattern
and whatever they were doing just before
they got the reward they repeat that
particular pattern sometimes it was even
spinning around twice counterclockwise
once clockwise and peck the key twice
and that&#39;s called superstition and that
I&#39;m afraid we will always have with us I
call this process pattern issah T that
is the tendency to find meaningful
patterns in both meaningful and
meaningless noise when we do this
process we make two types of errors a
type 1 error or false positive is
believing a pattern is real when it&#39;s
not our second type of error is a false
negative a type 2 error is not believing
a pattern is real when it is so let&#39;s do
a thought experiment you are a hominid 3
million years ago walking on the plains
of Africa your name is Lucy ok and and
you hear a rustle in the grass is it a
dangerous predator is that just the wind
your next decision could be the most
important one of your life well if you
think that the rustle in the grass is is
a dangerous predator and it turns out
it&#39;s just the wind you&#39;ve made an error
in cognition you made a type 1 error
false positive but no harm you just move
away you&#39;re more cautious you&#39;re more
vigilant on the other hand if you
believe that the rustle in the grass is
just the wind and it turns out it&#39;s a
dangerous predator your lunch you&#39;ve
just won a Darwin Award you&#39;ve been
taken out of the gene pool now the
problem here is that pattern issah T&#39;s
will occur whenever the
cost of making a type 1 error is less
than the cost of making a type 2 error
this is the only equation in the talk by
the way we have a pattern detection
problem that is assessing the difference
between a type 1 and a type 2 error is
highly problematic especially in
split-second life-and-death situations
so the default position is just believe
all patterns are real all Russell&#39;s in
the grass are dangerous predators and
not just the wind and so I think that we
evolved there was a natural selection
for the propensity for our belief
engines are pattern-seeking brain
processes to always find meaningful
patterns and infuse them with these sort
of predatory or intentional agencies
that I&#39;ll come back to so for example
what do you see here
it&#39;s a horse head that&#39;s right it looks
like a horse must be a horse that&#39;s a
pattern and is it really a horse or is
it more like a frog see our pattern
detection device which is appears to be
located in the anterior cingulate cortex
it&#39;s our little sort of detection device
there can be easily fooled and this is
the problem for example what do you see
here yes of course it&#39;s a cow
once I primed the brain it&#39;s called
cognitive priming once I prime the brain
to see it it pops back out again
even without the pattern that I&#39;ve
imposed on it and what do you see here
some people see a Dalmatian dog yes
there it is and there&#39;s the prime so
when I go back without the prime your
brain already has the model so you can
see it again what do you see here planet
Saturn yes that&#39;s good how about here
just shout out anything you see
that&#39;s a good audience Chris because
there&#39;s nothing in this well allegedly
there&#39;s nothing this is an experiment
done by Jennifer whitson at at UT Austin
on corporate environments and whether
uncertain feelings of uncertainty and
out of control makes people see illusory
patterns that is almost everybody sees
the planet Saturn people that are put in
a condition of a feeling out of control
are more likely to see something in this
which is allegedly patternless in other
words the propensity to feel these are
find these patterns goes up when there&#39;s
a lack of control for example baseball
players are notoriously superstitious
when they&#39;re batting but not so much
when they&#39;re fielding because fielder&#39;s
her successful ninety to ninety-five
percent of the time the best batters
fail seven out of ten times so their
superstitions their pattern issah tees
are all associated with feelings of lack
of control and so forth what do you see
in this particular one here in this
field anybody see a object there there
actually is something here but it&#39;s
degraded while you&#39;re thinking about
that this was an experiment done by
Susan Blackmore a psychologist in
England who showed subjects this
degraded image and then ran a
correlation between their scores on an
ESP test how much do they believe in the
paranormal supernatural angels and and
so forth and those who scored high on
the ESP scale tended to see I only see
more patterns in the degraded images but
incorrect patterns here is what you show
subjects the fish is degraded 20% 50%
and then the one I showed you 70 percent
a similar experiment was done by another
British psychologist named Peter Berger
who found significantly more patterns
meaningful patterns were received I
perceived on the right hemisphere via
the left visual field and the left
hemisphere so if you present subjects
the image is such that it&#39;s going to end
up on the right hemisphere instead of
the left then they&#39;re more likely to see
patterns than if you&#39;ve put it on the
left hemisphere our right hemisphere
appears to be where a lot of this
pattern issah T occurs so what we&#39;re
trying to do is bore into the brain to
see where all this happens Berger and
his colleague Christine Moore gave
subjects Aldo
but l-dopa is a drug as you know given
for treating parkinson&#39;s disease which
is related to a decrease in dopamine
l-dopa increases dopamine an increase of
dopamine cause subjects to see more
patterns than those that did not receive
the dopamine so dopamine appears to be
the drug associated with pattern isset
II in fact neuroleptic drugs that are
used to eliminate psychotic behavior
things like paranoia delusions and
hallucinations
these are pattern isset EES they&#39;re
incorrect patterns or false positives or
type 1 errors and if you give them drugs
that are a&#39;dope Amin antagonists they go
away that as you decrease the amount of
dopamine and their tendency to see
patterns like that decreases on the
other hand and feta means like in
cocaine our dopamine agonist they
increase the amount of dopamine so
you&#39;re more likely to be feeling a
euphoric state creativity find more
patterns in fact I saw Robin Williams
recently talked about how he he was
thought he was much funnier when he was
doing cocaine when he had that issue
than that now so perhaps more dopamine
is related to more creativity dopamine I
think changes our signal-to-noise ratio
that is how accurate we are in finding
patterns if it&#39;s too low you&#39;re more
likely to make too many type 2 errors
you missed the real patterns you don&#39;t
want to be too skeptical if you&#39;re too
skeptical you miss the really
interesting good ideas just right you&#39;re
creative and yet you don&#39;t fall for too
much baloney too high and maybe you see
patterns everywhere every time somebody
looks at you you think people are
staring at you you think people are
talking about you and if you go too far
on that that&#39;s just simply labelled as
madness it&#39;s a distinction perhaps we
might make between two Nobel laureates
Richard Feinman and John Nash one sees
maybe just the right number of patterns
to win a Nobel Prize the other one also
but maybe too many patterns and we then
call that schizophrenia so the
signal-to-noise ratio then presents us
with a pattern detection problem and of
course you all know exactly what this is
right and what pattern do you see here
again I&#39;m putting your anterior
cingulate cortex to the test here
causing you conflicting pattern
detection &#39;z you know of course this is
via uno shoes these are sandals
pretty sexy feet I must say maybe a
little Photoshop and of course the
ambiguous figures that seem to flip-flop
back and forth turns out what you&#39;re
thinking about a lot influences what you
tend to see you know and you see the
lamp here I know because if lights on
here
of course thanks to the environmentalist
movement we&#39;re all sensitive to the
plight of marine mammals so what you see
in this in this particular ambiguous
figures of course the Dolphins right you
see a dolphin here and and there&#39;s a
dolphin and there&#39;s a dolphin this is a
dot that&#39;s a dolphin tail there guys if
if we can give you conflicting data
again your ACC is going to be going into
hyperdrive if you look down here it&#39;s
fine if you look up here then you get
conflicting data and then we have to
flip the image for you to see that it&#39;s
a setup the impossible cradle lusion
it&#39;s easy to fool the brain and 2d so
you say oh come on trimmer anybody can
do that a psych 101 text with a illusion
like that well here&#39;s the late great
Jerry Andrus is impossible create
illusion in 3d in which Jerry is
standing inside the impossible crate and
he was kind enough to post this and give
us the reveal of course camera angle is
everything the photographer is over
there and this board appears to overlap
with this one and this one at that one
and so on but even when I take it away
the illusion is so powerful because of
how our brains are wired to find those
certain kinds of patterns this is a
fairly new one that throws us off
because of the conflicting patterns of
comparing this angle with that angle in
fact it&#39;s the exact same picture side by
side so what you&#39;re doing is comparing
that angle instead of with this one but
with that one and so your brain is
fooled yet again your pattern detection
devices are fooled faces are easy to see
because we have an additional evolved
facial recognition software in our
temporal lobes here are some faces on
the side of a rock I&#39;m actually not even
sure if this is this might be Photoshop
but anyway the point is still made which
one of these looks odd to you in a quick
reaction which one looks odd
the one on the left okay I&#39;ll rotate it
so it&#39;ll be the one on the right and you
are correct fairly famous illusion was
first done with Margaret Thatcher now
they trade up to politicians every time
well why is this happening well we know
exactly where it happens in the temporal
lobe right the cross is sort of above
your ear there in a little structure
called the fusiform gyrus and there&#39;s
two types of cells that do this that
record facial features either globally
or specifically these large rapid-firing
cells first look at the general face so
you recognize Obama immediately and then
you notice something quite a little bit
odd about the eyes in the mouth
especially when they&#39;re upside down
you&#39;re engaging that general facial
recognition software there now I said
back in our little thought experiment
you&#39;re a hominid walking on the plains
of Africa is it just the wind or a
dangerous predator what&#39;s the difference
between those well a wind is inanimate a
dangerous predator is an intentional
agent and I call this process agent
isset II that is the tendency to infuse
patterns with meaning and tension and
agency often invisible beings from the
top down this is an idea that we got
from a fellow tedster here Dan Dennett
who talked about and taking the
intentional stance so it&#39;s a type of
that expanded to explain I think a lot
of different things soul spirits ghosts
gods demons angels aliens intelligent
designers government conspiracists and
all manner of invisible agents with
power and intention or believed to haunt
our world and control our lives I think
it&#39;s the basis of animism and polytheism
and monotheism it&#39;s the belief that
aliens are somehow more advanced than us
more moral than us and the narratives
always are that they&#39;re coming here to
save us and rescue us from on high the
intelligent designer is always portrayed
as this super intelligent moral being
that comes down to design life even the
idea that government can rescue us
that&#39;s no longer the wave of the future
but that is I think a type of agent
isset II they&#39;re projecting somebody up
there big and powerful will come rescue
us and this is also I think the basis of
conspiracy theories there&#39;s somebody
hiding behind they&#39;re pulling the
strings whether it&#39;s the Illuminati or
the Bilderbergers but this is a pattern
detection problem isn&#39;t it some patterns
are real and some are not was JFK
assassinated by a conspiracy or by a
lone assassin well if you
oh there there&#39;s people there on any
given day like when I went there here
showing me where the different shooters
were my favorite one was he was in the
manhole and he popped out at the last
second took that shot but of course
Lincoln was assassinated by conspiracy
so we can&#39;t just uniformly dismiss all
patterns like that because let&#39;s face it
some patterns are real some conspiracies
really are true explains a lot maybe at
9/11 as a conspiracy theory it is a
conspiracy we did a whole issue on it 19
members of al-qaeda plotting to fly
planes into buildings constitutes a
conspiracy but that&#39;s not what the 9/11
truthers think they think it was an
inside job by the Bush administration
well that&#39;s a whole nother lecture but
you know we know that 9/11 was not
orchestrated by the Bush administration
because it worked
so we are natural-born duelists our
agent isset e process sums from the fact
that we can enjoy movies like these
because we can imagine an essence
continuing on we know that if you
stimulate the temporal lobe you can
produce a feeling of out-of-body
experiences near-death experiences which
you can do by just touching an electrode
to the temporal lobe there or you can do
it through loss of consciousness by
accelerating in a centrifuge you get a
hypoxia or a lower oxygen and the brain
then senses that there&#39;s a out-of-body
experience you can use which I did went
out and did Michael Persinger is God
helmet that bombard your temporal lobes
with electromagnetic waves and you get a
sense of out-of-body experience so I&#39;m
going to I&#39;m gonna end here with a short
video clip that sort of brings all this
together it&#39;s just a minute and a half
it ties together all this into the power
of expectation and the power of belief
go ahead and roll it this is the venue
they chose for their fake auditions for
an advert for lip balm we&#39;re hoping that
we can use part of this international
commercial alright and this is a test on
some lip balms that we have over here
and these are our models they&#39;re gonna
help us return max
and we have a leading brand would you
have any problem kissing our models
today
think that was fine
is a blind test I&#39;m going to ask you two
to go ahead and put a blindfold on okay
now can you see anything hold up so you
can&#39;t even see down it&#39;s completely
blind now right okay
now what I&#39;m going to be looking for in
this test is
and maybe if you can discern any flavor
have you ever done a kiss intestine
okay I&#39;m gonna ask you to pucker up
pucker up big and lean in just a little
bit okay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay how does that feel
thank you very much they do thanks
thanks
