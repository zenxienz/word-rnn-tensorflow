so great honor to be here it&#39;s a great
honor to be talking about cities talking
about the future of cities it&#39;s great to
be here as a mayor I really do believe
that mayor&#39;s have the political position
to really change people lives that steps
the place to be and it&#39;s great to be
here as the mayor of Rio Rio is a
beautiful city a violent place special
place actually you look into a guy that
has the best job in the world and I
really wanted to share you a very
special moment of my life and the
history of the city of Rio and now
ladies and gentlemen the envelope
contained the result
to announce that the games of the 31st
Olympiad awarded to the city of Rio de
canela okay that&#39;s very touching very
emotional but it was not easy to get
there actually was a very hard challenge
we had to beat the European monarchy
this is say one Carlos king of Spain we
had to beat the power for Japanese with
all their technology we had to be the
most powerful man in the world defending
his own city so it was not easy at all
and actually this last guy here said a
phrase a few years ago that I think fits
perfectly to the situation of real
winning the Olympic bid I mean we really
showed that yes we can and I really this
is the reason I came here tonight i mean
i came in i just showed to tell you that
things can be done that you don&#39;t have
always to be rich or powerful to get
things on the way that cities are a
great challenge it&#39;s a difficult task to
deal with cities but with some original
ways of getting things done with some
basic commandments you can really get
cities to be a great great place to live
i watch all to imagine real I mean you
probably fool thing about a city full of
energy a vibrant city full of green and
nobody showed that better than carlos
saldanha last year&#39;s real
this is incredible
Oh
okay some parts of real I pretty much
like that but it&#39;s not like that
everywhere we like every big city in the
world we got lots of people pollution
cars concrete lots of concrete these
pictures i&#39;m showing here they are some
pictures from modulator it&#39;s like the
heart of the suburb in rio and i want to
use an example of real that we&#39;re doing
madrid in this region to see what we
should think it&#39;s our first commandment
so every time you see a concrete jungle
like that what you got to do is find
open spaces if you don&#39;t have open
spaces you got to go there at open
spaces so go inside this open spaces and
make that people can get inside can use
that spaces this is going to be the
third largest park in real I June this
year it&#39;s going to be a place where
people can meet where you can put nature
the temperature is going to drop 23
degrees centigrade so the first
commandment I want to leave your
tinnitus city of the future has to be
environmentally friendly every time you
think of a city you gotta think green
you got a fing green and green so moving
to our second commandment that I wanted
to show you let&#39;s think that cities are
made of people I mean lots of people
together cities a packed with people so
how do you do you move these people
around when you have 3.5 billion people
living in cities by 2050 it&#39;s going to
be 60 million people so every time you
think about moving these people around
you think about high-capacity
transportation but there is a problem
high-capacity transportation means
spending lots and lots of money so what
I&#39;m going to show here is something that
was already presented in Ted by the
former mayor of Curitiba you created
that a city in Brazil Jamie Lana and
it&#39;s something that we&#39;re doing again
lots in real it&#39;s the BRT the bus rapid
transit so you get a bus the simple bus
that everybody knows you transform it
inside as a train car you separate lanes
dedicated lanes the contractors they
don&#39;t like that you don&#39;t have to dig
deep down on the ground you can build
nice stations this is actually a station
that we&#39;re doing real
again you don&#39;t have to dig deep down on
the ground to make a station like that
the station you have the sink on for the
same features as a subway station the
kilometer of these costs a tenth of a
subway so spending much less money and
doing it much faster you can really
change the way people move this is a map
of real all the lines the color lines
you see there it&#39;s our high-capacity
transportation network in this present
time today we only carry eighteen
percent of our population in
high-capacity transportation with the
BRTS we are doing again cheapest and
fastest way we&#39;re going to move to
sixty-three percent of the population
being carried by high-capacity
transportation so remember what I said
you don&#39;t always have to be rich or
powerful to get things done you can find
the regional ways to get things done so
the second commandment I want to leave
here tonight is a city of the future has
to deal with mobility and integration of
its people moving to the third
commandment and this is the most
controversial one has to do with the
favelas the slums whatever you call it
there are different names all over the
world but at the point we want to make
your tinnitus favelas are not always a
problem I mean favelas can sometimes
really be a solution if you deal with
them if you put public policy inside the
favelas let me just show a map of Rio
again Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants
more than twenty percent 1.4 million
live in the favelas all these red spots
are favela so you see they&#39;re spread all
over the city this is a typical view of
a favela in rio I mean you see the
contrast between the rich and poor so I
want to make two points here tonight
about favelas the first one is you can
change from what I call a visual circle
to a virtual circle but what you got to
do to get that is you got to go inside
the favelas bring in the basic services
mainly education and health with high
quality i&#39;m going to give fast example
here this was an old beauty in a favela
in rio culinary denominator
that we just transformed into a primary
school I mean with high quality this is
a primary assistant in health that we
build inside a favela again with high
quality we call it Family Clinic so the
first point is that bring basic services
inside the favelas with high quality the
second point I want to make about the
favela sees you gotta open spaces in the
favela bring infrastructure to the
favelas to the slums wherever you are I
mean Rio has the aim by 2022 by volt
it&#39;s favelas completely urbanized
another example this was completely
packed with house and then we build this
what we call a knowledge square this is
a place with high technology where the
kids that live in a poor house next to
this place can go inside and have access
to all technology we even build a
theater there 3d movie and this is the
kind of change you can get for that so
then by the end of the day you get
something better than a TED Prize which
is this great life from a kid that lived
in the favela so the third commandment I
want to live here tonight is a city of
the future has to be socially integrated
you cannot deal with the city if it
starts socially integrated but moving to
our fourth commandment I really wouldn&#39;t
be here tonight I mean between november
and may 30 is completely packed we just
had last week carnival it was great it
was lots of fun we have New Year&#39;s Eves
like two million people in Copacabana
beach we have problems I mean we find
floods tropical rains at this time of
the year you can imagine how people get
happy with me watching this kind of
scenes we have problems with the
tropical rains almost every year we have
this landslide which are terrible but
the reason I could come here it&#39;s
because of that this was something that
we do that with IBM that&#39;s a little bit
more than a year old it&#39;s what we call
the operation center of real and I
wanted to show that I can govern my city
using technology from here from long
beach so I got your last Titanic know
everything we got to speak now to the
operations center this is also a Leo his
secretary of urban affair
so it&#39;s all good to be there with you
I&#39;ve already told it to people that we
have tropical rain this time of the year
so how&#39;s the weather he real now whether
it&#39;s fine we had a fair weather today
let me catch you our weather satellite
radar you see just a little bit of
moisture around the city absolutely no
problem in the cheat in terms of weather
today and in the next few days ok how&#39;s
the traffic I mean with this time of
year again lots of traffic jam people
get married aamir so how&#39;s the traffic
tonight well traffic tonight is fine let
me get you one of our budgets what about
8,000 versus arrived transmission
enzymes are real for you mr. mayor you
see the streets are clear now it&#39;s 11pm
in real locking of concern in terms of
traffic I&#39;ll get to you now the
incidence of the day we have heavy
traffic since early in the morning and
in the rush hour in the afternoon but
nothing of be concerned we are below
average in terms of traffic incidents in
the city ok so you show you how some
public services these are the cars
absolutely good to me let me get you the
fleet of our waste collection but this
is live transmissions we have gps is in
all of our trucks and you can see them
working in all parts of the city waste
collection on times public service is
working well ok let&#39;s audio thank you
very much it was great to have you here
we&#39;re going to move so they can make a
conclusion ok so dope files displays no
paperwork no distance 24-7 working so
the fourth commandment i want to share
you here tonight is city of the future
has to use technology to be present i
mean i don&#39;t need to be there anymore to
know and to administrate the sea but
everything that i said it tonight are
the commandments are means a ways for us
to govern cities I mean invest in
infrastructure invests in the green open
parks open spaces integrate socially use
technology but by the end of the day
when we talk about cities we talk about
gathering of people and we cannot see
that as a problem that is fantastic if
there&#39;s three
my five billion now it&#39;s going to be six
billion then it&#39;s going to be 10 billion
that is great that means that we&#39;re
going to have 10 billion minds working
together 10 billion talents together so
a city of the future I really do believe
that it&#39;s a city that cares about its
citizens integrate socially its citizens
a city of the future is a city that can
never let anyone out of this great party
which are cities thank you very much
