everything I do and everything I do
professionally my life has been shaped
by seven years of work as a young man in
africa from 1971 290 77 a look young but
I&#39;m not I worked in Zambia keenya Ivory
Coast algeria somalia in projects of
technical cooperation with african
countries i worked for an Italian NGO
and every single project that we set up
in Africa failed and I was destroyed I
thought age 21 that we Italians were
good people and we were doing good work
in Africa instead everything we touched
we killed
our first project the one that has
inspired my first book ripples from the
Zambezi was a project where we Italians
decided to teach Zambian people how to
grow food so we arrived there with
Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this
absolutely magnificent valley going down
to the Zambezi River and we took the
local people how to grow Italian
tomatoes and zucchini in and of course
the local people had absolutely no
interest in doing that so we pay them to
come and work and sometimes they would
show up and we were amazed that the
local people in such fertile valley
would not have any agriculture and but
instead of asking them how come they
were not growing anything we simply said
thank God we here just in the nick of
time to save the tambien people from
starvation and of course everything in
Africa grew beautifully and we had this
magnificent tomatoes in Italy 80 matter
will grow to this size in Zambia to this
size and we could not believe and we
were telling the jumpiest look how easy
agriculture is when the tomatoes were
nice and ripe and red organized some 200
hippos que mat√≥ from the river and they
ate everything
and we say to the zambian my god the
hippos and that lambda said yes that&#39;s
why we have no agriculture here why
didn&#39;t you tell us you never asked I
thought was only us Italians blundering
around Africa but then I saw what the
Americans were doing what the English
were doing what the French were doing
and after seeing what they were doing I
became quite proud of our project in
Zambia because you see at least we fed
the hippos you should see the rubbish
you should see the rubbish that we have
bestowed on unsuspecting African people
you want to read the book read dead aid
by the missa mayo Zambian woman
economists the book was published in
2009 we Western donor country have given
the African continent two trillion
dollars American in the last 50 years
I&#39;m not going to tell you the damage
that the money is done just go and read
her book read reader from an African
woman the damage that we have done we
Western people are imperialist
colonialist missionaries and there are
only two ways we deal with people we are
the patronize them or we are
paternalistic the two words come from
the Latin root pattern which means
father but they mean two different
things but Anna listed I tricked anybody
from a different culture as if they were
my children I love you so much
patronizing I treat everybody from
another culture as if they were my
servant that&#39;s why the white people in
Africa are called wanna boss I was given
a slap in the face reading a book small
is beautiful written by Schumacher
who said above all in economic
development if people do not wish to be
helped leave them alone this should be
the first principle of aid the first
principle of aid is respect this morning
the gentleman who opened this conference
they stick on the floor and say can we
can you imagine a city that is not
neo-colonial I decided when I was 27
years old to only respond to people and
I invented the system called enterprise
facilitation where you never initiate
anything you never motivate anybody but
you become a servant of the local
passion the servant of local people who
have a dream to become a better person
so what you do you shut up you never
arrived in a community with any ideas
and you sit with the local people we
don&#39;t work from offices we meet at the
cafe we meet at the pub we have zero
infrastructure and what we do we become
friends and we find out what that person
wants to do the most important thing is
passion you can give somebody an idea if
that person doesn&#39;t want to do it what
are you going to do the passion that the
person has for her own growth is the
most important thing the passion that
that man has for his own personal growth
is the most important thing and then we
help them to go and find the knowledge
because nobody in the world can succeed
alone the person with the idea may not
have the knowledge but the knowledge is
available so years and years ago I had
this idea why don&#39;t we for once instead
of arriving in a community to tell
people were to do why don&#39;t for once
listen to them but not in community
meetings let me tell you a secret there
is a problem with community meetings
entrepreneurs never come and they never
tell you at them in a public meeting
what they want to do with their own
money what opportunity they have
identified so planning has this blind
spot the smartest people in your
community you don&#39;t even know because
they don&#39;t come to your public meetings
what we do we work one-on-one and to
work one-on-one you have to create a
social infrastructure that doesn&#39;t exist
you have to create a new profession the
profession is the family doctor of
enterprise the family doctor business
who sits with you in your house at your
kitchen table at the cafe and helps you
find the resources to transform your
passion into a way to make a living I
started this as a tryout in in esperance
in Western Australia I was doing PhD at
the time trying to go away from this
patronizing bullshit that we arrived and
tell you what to do and so what I did in
esperance that first year was to just
walk the streets and in the fin in three
days I had my first client and I helped
his first guy who was smoking fish from
a garage was a Maori guy and I helped
him to sell to the restaurant in Perth
to get organized and then the fisherman
came to me to say you the guy who helped
Maury can you help us and I helped his
five fishermen to work together and get
this beautiful tuna not to the cannery
in Albany for sixty cents a kilo but we
find a way
to take the fish for sushi to Japan for
fifteen dollars a kilo and the farmers
came to talk to me say have you help
them can you help us in a year had 27
projects going on and the government
came to see me to say how can you do
that how can you and I said I do
something very very very difficult I
shut up and listen to them so so the
government says do it again we done in
300 communities around the world we have
out to start 40,000 businesses there is
a new generation of entrepreneurs who
are dying of Solitude Peter Drucker one
of the greatest management consultants
in history&#39;s died aged 96 few years ago
Peter draaga was a professor of
philosophy before become involved in
business and this is what Peter Drucker
says planning is actually incompatible
with an entrepreneurial society and
economy planning is the kiss of death of
entrepreneurship so now you&#39;re
rebuilding Christchurch without knowing
what the smartest people in Christchurch
you want to do with their own money and
their own energy you have to learn how
to get these people to come and talk to
you you have to offer them
confidentiality privacy you have to be
fantastic at helping them and then they
will come and they will come in droves
in a community of 10,000 people we get
200 clients can you imagine a community
of 400,000 people the intelligence and
the passion which presentation if you
uploaded the most this morning local
passionate people that&#39;s who you have
uploaded so what I&#39;m saying is that
entrepreneurship is where it&#39;s at we at
the end or the first Industrial
Revolution non-renewable fossil fuels
manufacturing and all of a sudden we
have system which are not sustainable
the internal combustion engine is not
sustainable free and we&#39;re maintaining
thix is not sustainable what we have to
look at is that how we feed cure educate
transport you know communicate for seven
billion people in a sustainable way the
technologies do not exist to do that who
is going to invent the technology for
the Green Revolution universities forget
about it government forget about it
would be entrepreneurs and they doing it
now there&#39;s a lovely story that are
ready now in a futurist magazine many
many years ago there was a group of
experts who were invited to discuss the
future of the city of New York in 1860
and in 1860 this group of people came
together and they all speculated about
what would happen to a city of New York
in 100 years and the conclusion was
unanimous the city of New York would not
exist in 100 years why because they look
at the curb I said if the population
keeps growing at this rate to move the
population of New York around they would
have needed 6 million horses and then
manure created by six million also would
be impossible to deal with there was
already drowning in mineira so 1860 they
are seeing these dirty technology it is
going to choke the life out of New York
so what happens in 40 years time in ear
1900 in the United States of America
they were 1001 car manufacturing
companies 1001 they idea of a funny
different technology
absolutely taken over and there were
tiny tiny little factories in back
waters dearborn michigan henry ford
however there is a secret to work with
entrepreneurs first you have to offer
them confidentiality otherwise no they
don&#39;t come and talk to you then you have
to talk offer them absolutely dedicated
in passionate service to them and then
you have to tell them the truth about
entrepreneurship the smallest company
the biggest company has to be capable
doing three things beautifully the
product that you want to sell has to be
fantastic you have to have met fantastic
marketing and you have have tremendous
financial management guess what we have
never met a single human being in the
world who can make it sell it a look
after the money doesn&#39;t exist this
person has never been born we&#39;ve done
the research and we have looked at the
100 iconic companies of the world
Carnegie Westinghouse Edison&#39;s Ford all
the new companies Google Yahoo there&#39;s
only one thing that all this successful
company in the world have in common only
once none was started by one person now
we teach entrepreneurship to 16 years
old in Northumberland and we start the
class by giving them the first two pages
of Richard Branson autobiography and the
task of the 16 years old is it to
underline in the first two pages of
Richard Branson autobiography how many
times Richard uses the word I and how
many times use of the word we never the
word I and the word we 32 times he
wasn&#39;t alone when he started nobody
started a company alone
no one so we can create a community
where we have facilitators who come from
a small business background sitting in
cafes in bars and are your dedicated
buddies who will go to you what somebody
did for this gentleman who talked about
you know this attic somebody who will
say to you what do you need what can you
do can you make it okay can you sell it
can you look after the money oh no I
cannot do this would you like me to find
you somebody we activate communities we
have groups of volunteers supporting the
enterprise facilitator to help you to
find resources and people and we have
discovered that the miracle of the
intelligence of local people is such
that you can change the culture and the
economy of this community just by
capturing the passion the energy and
imagination of your own people thank
you
