I don&#39;t know why but I&#39;m continually
amazed to think that two and a half
billion of us around the world are
connected to each other through the
internet and that at any point in time
more than thirty percent of the world&#39;s
population can go online to learn to
create and to share and the amount of
time each of us suspending doing all of
this is also continuing to grow a recent
study showed that the young generation
alone is spending over eight hours a day
online is the parent of a nine-year-old
girl that number seems awfully low but
just as the Internet has opened up the
world for each and every one of us it
has also opened up each and every one of
us to the world and increasingly the
price we&#39;re being asked to pay for all
of this connectedness is our privacy
today what many of us would love to
believe is that the Internet is a
private place it&#39;s not and with every
click of the mouse and every touch of
the screen we are like Hansel and Gretel
leaving breadcrumbs of our personal
information everywhere we travel through
the digital woods we are leaving our
birthdays our places of residence our
interests and preferences our
relationships our financial histories
and on and on it goes now don&#39;t get me
wrong I&#39;m not for one minute suggesting
that sharing data is a bad thing in fact
when I know the data that&#39;s being shared
and I&#39;m asked explicitly for my consent
I want some sites to understand my
habits it helps them suggest books for
me to read or movies for my family to
watch for friends for us to connect with
but when I don&#39;t know and what I haven&#39;t
been asked that&#39;s when the problem
arises it&#39;s a phenomenon on the internet
today called behavioral tracking and it
is very big business in fact there&#39;s an
entire industry formed around following
us through the digital woods and
compiling a profile on each of us and
when all of that data is held they can
do almost whatever they want with it
this is an area today that has very few
regulations
even fewer rules except for some of the
recent announcements here in the United
States and Europe it&#39;s an area of
consumer protection that&#39;s almost
entirely naked so let me expose this
lurking industry a little bit further
the visualization you see forming behind
me is called collusion and it&#39;s an
experimental browser add-on that you can
install in your firefox browser that
helps you see where your web data is
going and who&#39;s tracking you the red
dots you see up there our sites that are
behavioral tracking that I have not
navigated to but are following me the
blue dots are the sites that I&#39;ve
actually navigated directly to and the
gray dots our sites that are also
tracking me but I have no idea who they
are all of them are connected as you can
see to form a picture of me on the web
and this is my profile so let me go from
an example to something very specific
and personal I installed collusion in my
own laptop two weeks ago and I let it
follow me around for what was a pretty
typical day now like most of you I
actually start my day going online and
checking email I then go to a new site
look for some headlines and in this
particular case I happen to like one of
them on the merits of music literacy in
schools and I shared it over a social
network our daughter then joined us at
the breakfast table and I asked her is
there an emphasis on music literacy in
your school and she of course naturally
as a nine-year-old looked at me and said
quizzically what&#39;s literacy so I center
online of course to look it up now let
me stop here we are not even two bites
into breakfast and there are already
nearly 25 sites that are tracking me I
have navigated to a total of four so let
me fast-forward through the rest of my
day I go to work I check email I log on
to a few more social sites I blog I
checked more news reports I share some
of those news reports I go look at some
videos pretty typical day in this case
actually fairly pedantic and at the end
of the day as my day winds down look at
my profile the red dots have exploded
the gray dots have grown exponentially
all in all there&#39;s over a hundred and
fifty sites that are now tracking my
personal information most all of them
without my consent I look at this
picture and it freaks me out this is
nothing I am being stalked across the
web and why is this happening pretty
simple it&#39;s huge business the revenue of
the top handful of companies in this
space is over thirty nine billion
dollars today and as adults we are
certainly not alone at the same time I
installed my own collusion profile
installed one for my daughter and on one
single Saturday morning over two hours
on the Internet here&#39;s her collusion
profile this is a nine-year-old girl
navigating to principally children&#39;s
sites I move from this from freaked out
to enrage this is no longer me being a
tech pioneer or a privacy advocate this
is me being a parent imagine in the
physical world if somebody followed our
children around with a camera and a
notebook and recorded their every
movement I can tell you there isn&#39;t a
person in this room that would sit idly
by we&#39;d take action it may not be good
action but we would take action we can&#39;t
sit idly by here either this is
happening today privacy is not an option
and it shouldn&#39;t be the price we accept
for just getting on the internet our
voices matter and our actions matter
even more today we&#39;ve launched collusion
you can download it install it in
Firefox to see who is tracking you
across the web and following you through
the digital woods going forward all of
our voices need to be heard because what
we don&#39;t know can actually hurt us
because the memory of the Internet is
forever we are being watched it&#39;s now
time for us to watch the Watchers thank
you
