now I want to talk about my
investigations into what technology
means in our lives not just our
immediate life but in the cosmic sense
in a kind of a long history of the world
and and our place in the world what is
this stuff what what is the significance
and so I want to kind of go through my
little story of what I found out and one
of the first things I started to
investigate was the history of the name
of Technology and in the United States
or as a state of the union address given
by every presidents that since 1790 then
each one of those is really kind of
summing up the most important things for
the United States at that time if you
search for the word technology it was
not used until nineteen fifty two so
technology was sort of absent from
everybody thinking until nineteen fifty
two which happened to be the year of my
birth and obviously technology had
existed before then but we weren&#39;t aware
of it and so it was sort of awakening of
this force in our life I actually did
research to find out the first use of
the word technology and was in 1829 and
it was invented by a guy who was
starting a curriculum of course they
bring together all the kinds of arts and
crafts and Industry and he called it
technology and that&#39;s the very first use
of the word so what is the stuff that
we&#39;re all consumed by and bothered by
Allan K calls the technology is anything
that was invented after you were born
which is sort of the idea that we
normally have of biotechnology is it&#39;s
all that&#39;s new stuff it&#39;s not roads or
penicillin or factory tires it&#39;s it&#39;s
the new stuff my friend Danny Hillis as
a kind of a similar one this
technology&#39;s anything doesn&#39;t work yet
which is again a sense that it&#39;s all new
but we know that it&#39;s just not new it&#39;s
it actually goes way back and what I
want to suggest as it goes along way
back so another way to think about
technology what it means is to imagine a
world without technology if we were to
eliminate
every single bit of technology in the
world today and I mean everything from
blades to scrapers to cloth we as a
species would not live very long we die
by the billions and very quickly the
Wolves would get us we would be
defenseless we would be unable to grow
enough food or finding our food even the
hunter-gatherers use some elementary
tools and so with they have minimal
technology but they have some technology
and those if we study those
hunter-gatherer tribes and the
Neanderthal which are very similar to
early man we find out a very curious
thing about this world without
technology and this is a kind of a curve
of their average age there are no
Neanderthal fossils that are older than
40 years old that we&#39;ve ever found so
and the average age of most of these
hundred or gather tribes is 20 to 30
there are very few young infants because
they die a high mortality rate and
there&#39;s very few old people so the
profile servier your average San
Francisco neighborhood a lot of young
people if you go there you say hey
everybody&#39;s really healthy that&#39;s
because they&#39;re all young the same thing
is with the hunter-gatherer tribes and
early man is is is that you didn&#39;t live
beyond the age of 30 so it was a world
without grandparents and grandparents
are very important because they are the
transmitter of cultural evolution and
information imagine a world and
basically everybody was 20 to 30 years
old how much learning can you do you
can&#39;t do very much learning in your own
life it&#39;s so short and there&#39;s nobody to
pass on what you do learn so that&#39;s one
aspect it was a very short life but at
the same time anthropologists know that
most hunter-gatherer tribes as the world
without very little technology actually
did not spend very long time gathering
the food that they needed three to six
hours a day some anthropologists calls
that the original affluent society
because they&#39;d banker hours basically so
it was possible to to to get enough food
but when the scarcity came when the
highs and lows and the droughts came
then people went into starvation and
that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t live very long so
what technology brought through the very
simple tools like these stone tools here
even something as small as this the
early bands of humans were actually able
to eliminate to extinction about 250
megafauna animals in North America when
they first arrived 10,000 years ago so
long before industrial age we&#39;ve been
affecting the planet on a global scale
with just a small amount of technology
the other thing that the early man then
it was fire and fire was used to clear
out and again affected the ecology of
grass and whole continents and was used
in cooking it enabled us to actually eat
all kinds of things it was sort of in a
certain sense and McLuhan sense an
external stomach in a sense that it was
cooking food that we could not otherwise
and if we don&#39;t have fire we actually
could not live our bites have adapted to
these new diets are bites have changed
in the last 10,000 years so what a
little bit of technology humans went
from a small band of 10,000 or so the
same number of Neanderthals everywhere
and we suddenly exploded dimension of
language around 50,000 years ago the
number of humans exploded and very
quickly became the dominant species on
the planet and they migrated into the
rest of the world at two kilometers per
year until within several tens of
thousands of years we occupied every
single watershed on the planet and
became the most dominant species with a
very small amount of technology and even
at that time with the introduction of
Agriculture 8,000 10,000 years ago we
start to see climate change so climate
change is not a new thing what&#39;s new is
just the degree it was even during the
agricultural age there was climate
change and so already small amounts of
technology we&#39;re transforming the world
and what this means and where I&#39;m going
is is that technology has become the
most powerful force in the world all the
things that we see today that are
changing our lives we can always trace
back to the introduction of some new
technology so it&#39;s a force that is the
most powerful force that has been
unleashed on this planet and it&#39;s such a
degree that I think that it&#39;s become our
what who we are in fact our humanity and
everything that we think about ourselves
is something that we&#39;ve invented so
we&#39;ve invented ourselves of all the
animals that we
domesticated the most important animal
we&#39;ve domesticated has been us okay so
humanity is our greatest invention but
of course we&#39;re not done yet we are
still inventing and this is what
technology is allowing us to do it&#39;s a
continually to reinvent ourselves it&#39;s a
very very strong force i call this
entire thing us humans as our technology
everything that we&#39;ve made gadgets in
our lives we call that the Technium
that&#39;s this world I debt working
definition of technologies anything that
useful that a human mind makes it&#39;s not
just hammers and gadgets like laptops
but it&#39;s also law and of course cities
are ways to make things more useful to
us while it&#39;s something that comes from
our mind it&#39;s also has his roots deeply
into the cosmos it goes back the origins
and roots of technology go back to the
Big Bang in this way in that they are
part of this self-organizing thread that
starts at the Big Bang and goes through
galaxies and stars into life and to us
and the three major phases of the early
universe was energy when the dominant
force was energy then it became the
dominant force as it cool became matter
and then with the vention of life four
billion years ago the dominant force in
our neighborhood became information
that&#39;s what life is this information
process that was restructuring and
making new order so those energy matter
Einstein showed were equivalent and now
new Sciences of quantum computing show
that entropy and information and matter
and energy are all interrelated so it&#39;s
one long continuum you put energy into a
the right kind of system and outcomes
wasted heat entropy and extra B which is
order it&#39;s the increasing order so where
does this order come from its roots go
way back we actually don&#39;t know but we
do know that the self-organization trend
throughout the universe is long and it
began with things like galaxies they
maintain their order for billions of
years SARS are basically nuclear fission
machines that self organize and self
sustained themselves for billions of
years this order against the extra p of
the world and flowers and plants are
same thing extended and technology is
basically an extension of life so one
trend that we notice and all those
things is that the amount of energy per
gram per second that close to this is
actually increasing the amount of energy
is increasing through this little
sequence and that the amount of energy
per gram per second that flows through
life is actually greater than a star
because of the Stars long length a long
life span the energy density in life is
actually higher than a star and the
energy density that we&#39;ve seen the
greatest if anywhere in the universe is
actually in a PC chip there&#39;s more
energy flowing through per gram per
second than anything that we have any
other experience with and so what I
would suggest is that if you want to see
where technology is going we continue
that trajectory and we say that was
going to become more energy-dense that&#39;s
where it&#39;s going and so what I&#39;ve done
is I&#39;ve taken the same kinds of things
and looked at other aspects of
evolutionary life and say what are the
general trends in evolutionary life and
there are things moving towards greater
complexity moving towards greater
diversity moving towards greater
specialization sentence ubiquity and
most important evolvability those very
same things are also present in
technology that&#39;s where technology is
going in fact technology is accelerating
all the aspects of life we can see that
happening just as there&#39;s diversity in
life there&#39;s more diversity and things
we make things in life start off being
general cell and they become specialized
of tissue cells your muscle brain cells
and same thing happens with say a hammer
which is general first and becomes more
specific so I would like to say that
while there are six kingdoms of life we
can think of technology basically as a
seventh kingdom of life it&#39;s the
granting off from the human form but
technology has its own agenda like
anything like life itself for instance
right now three quarters of the energy
that we use is actually used to feed the
Technium itself in transportation it&#39;s
not to move us is to move the stuff that
we make or buy I use the word want
technology wants this is a robot that
wants to plug itself in to get more
power your cat wants more
food a bacterium which has no
consciousness at all wants to move
towards light is an urge and technology
has an urge at the same time he wants to
give us things and what it gives us is
basically progress you can take all
kinds of curves and they&#39;re all pointing
up there&#39;s really no dispute about
progress if we discount the cost of that
and that&#39;s the thing that bothers most
people is that progress is really real
but we wonder in question whether the
environmental cost of it I did a survey
the number of species of artifacts in my
house and there&#39;s six thousand other
people have come up with 10,000 when
King Henry of England died he had 18,000
things in his house but that was entire
wealth of England so and with that
entire wealth of England King Henry
could not buy any antibiotics he could
not buy refrigeration could not buy a
trip of a thousand miles whereas this
rickshaw wallah India could save up and
buy antibiotics and he could buy
refrigeration he could buy things that
King Henry in his all&#39;s well that can
ever buy that&#39;s what progress is about
so technologies selfish technologies
generous that conflict that tension will
be with us forever that sometimes it
wants to do what it wants to do and
sometimes it going to do things for us
we have confusion about what we should
think about a new technology right now
the default position about when a new
technology comes along as we people talk
about the precautionary principle which
is very common in Europe which says
basically don&#39;t do anything when you
mean a new technology stop until we can
be proven that there&#39;s no harm I think
that is really leads nowhere but a
better way is to what I call proaction
airy principle which is you engage with
technology you try it out you obviously
do with the pro action airy
precautionary principle suggest you try
to anticipate it but after anticipating
it you constantly assess it not just
once but eternally and when it diverts
from what you want we prioritize risk we
evaluate not just the new stuff but the
old stuff we fix it but most importantly
relocated and what I mean by that is
that we find a new job for it nuclear
energy efficient is really bad idea
for bombs but it may be a pretty good
idea relocated into sustainable nuclear
energy for electricity instead of
burning coal when we have a bad idea the
response to a bad idea is not no ideas
it&#39;s not to stop thinking the response
to a bad idea like say tungsten light
bulb is a better idea okay so better
ideas is really always the response to
technology that we don&#39;t like it&#39;s
basically take better technology and
actually in a certain sense technology
is the kind of a method for generating
better ideas if you can think about it
that way so maybe spraying DDT on crops
is a really bad idea but DDT sprayed on
local homes there&#39;s nothing better to
eliminate malaria besides insect DDT
impregnated mosquito nets but that&#39;s a
really good idea that&#39;s a good job for
technology so our job is humans this is
her parent our mind children to find
them good friends to find them a good
job and so every technology is sort of a
creative force looking for the right job
that&#39;s actually my son right here there
are no bad technologies just like
there&#39;s no bad children children we
don&#39;t say children are neutral children
are positive we just have to find them
the right place and so what technology
gives us over the long term over the
sort of extended evolution from the
beginning of time through the mention of
of plants and animals and evolution of
life evolution of brains what that is
constantly giving us is increasing
differences it&#39;s increasing diversity
it&#39;s increasing options it&#39;s increasing
choices opportunities possibilities and
Freedoms that&#39;s what we get from
technology all the time that&#39;s why
people leave villages and go into cities
because they are always gravitating
towards increased choices and
possibilities and there and we are aware
of the price we pay a price for that but
we are aware of it and generally we will
pay the price for increased freedoms
choices and opportunities even
technology wants clean water its
technology diametrically opposed to
nature because technology is an
extension of life it&#39;s in
Carol and aligned with the same things
that life wants so that I think
technology loves biology if we allow it
to great movement that is starting
billions of years ago is moving through
us and it continues to go and our choice
so to speak in technology is really to
align ourselves with this force much
greater than ourselves so technology is
more than just the stuff in your pocket
it&#39;s more than just gadgets it&#39;s more
than just things that people in bed it&#39;s
actually part of a very long story a
great story that began billions of years
ago is moving through us as self
organization and we&#39;re extending
accelerating it and we can be part of it
by lining the technology that we make
with it and I really appreciate your
attention today thank you
