I&#39;m a brain scientist and as a brain
scientist I&#39;m actually interested in how
the brain learns and I&#39;m specially
interested in the possibility of making
our brains smarter better and faster
this is in this context I&#39;m going to
tell you about videogames when we say
videogame most of you think about
children it&#39;s true 90% of children do
play video games but let&#39;s be frank when
the kids are in bed who is in front of
the PlayStation most view the average
age of a gamer is 33 years old not 8
years old and in fact if we look at the
projected M graphics a video game play
the video game players of tomorrow are
older adults so video games is pervasive
throughout our society it is clearly
here to stay it has an amazing impact on
our everyday life consider these
statistics released by Activision after
one month of release of the game call of
duty black ops it had been played for
68,000 years worldwide right would any
of you complain if this was a case about
doing linear algebra so where are we
asking the lab is how can we leverage
that power now I want to step back a bit
I know most of you have had experience
of coming back home and finding your
kids playing these kind of games the
name of the game is to get after your
enemies don&#39;t be bad guys before they
get to you right and I&#39;m almost sure
most of your thought oh come on can&#39;t
you do something more intelligent than
shooting at zombies I&#39;d like you to put
this kind of knee-jerk reaction in the
context of what you would have thought
if you had found your girl playing suit
cool or your boy reading Shakespeare
right most parents would find that great
well I&#39;m not going to tell you that
playing video games days in and days out
is actually good for your health it&#39;s
not and binging is never good but I&#39;m
going to argue that in reasonable doses
actually the very game I showed you at
the beginning those action-packed
shooter games have quite powerful
effects and positive effects on many
different aspects of our behavior
there&#39;s not one week that goes without
some major headlines in the media about
whether video games are good or bad for
you right you all bombarded with that I
like to put this kind of Friday night
bar discussion aside and get you to
actually step into the lab what we do in
the lab is actually measure directly in
a quantitative fashion what is the
impact of video games on the brain and
so I&#39;m going to take a few examples from
our work one first saying that I&#39;m sure
you all have heard is the fact that too
much screen time makes your eyesight
worse that&#39;s a statement about vision
there may be vision scientists among you
we actually know how to test that
statement we can step in into the lab
and measure how good your vision is well
I guess what people that don&#39;t play a
lot of action games that don&#39;t actually
turn a lot of time in front of screens
have normal or what we call corrected to
normal vision that&#39;s okay the issues
what happens with these guys that
actually indulge into playing video
games like five hours per week 10 hours
per week 15 hours per week by that
statement their vision should be really
bad right guess what the vision is
really really good it&#39;s better than
those that don&#39;t play it&#39;s better in two
different ways the first way that they
actually able to resolve small detail in
the context of clutter though that means
being able to read the fine print on
prescription rather than using magnifier
glasses you can actually do it with just
your eyesight the other way that they
are bad
is actually being able to resolve
different levels of gray imagine you&#39;re
driving in the fog that makes a
difference between seeing the car in
front of you and avoiding the accident
or getting into an accident so we&#39;re
actually leveraging that work to develop
games for patients with low vision and
to have an impact on retraining their
brain to see better clearly when it
comes to action video games screen time
doesn&#39;t make your eyesight worse another
saying that I&#39;m sure you have all heard
around video games lead to attention
problem and greater distractibility okay
we know how to measure attention in the
lab I&#39;m actually going to give you an
example of how we do so I&#39;m going to ask
you to participate so you&#39;re going to
have to actually play the game with me
going to show you colored words I want
you to shout out the color of the ink
right so this is a first example orange
good green red yellow red yellow good
you got my point right you&#39;re getting
better but it&#39;s hard why is it hard
because I introduced a conflict between
the word itself and its color how good
your attention is determines actually
how fast resolve that conflict so the
young guys here at the top of their game
probably liked it a little better than
some of us that are older while we can
show that when you do this kind of task
with people that know a lot of action
games actually resolve the conflict
faster so clearly playing those action
games doesn&#39;t need to attentional
problems actually those actual video
game players have many other advantage
in terms of attention and one aspect of
attention which is also improved for the
better is our ability to track objects
around in the world this is something we
use all the time when you&#39;re driving
you&#39;re tracking keeping track of the
cars around you you&#39;re also keeping
track of the pedestrian the running dog
and that&#39;s how
you can actually be safe driving right
in a lab we get people to come to the
lab sit in front of a computer screen
and we give them little tasks that I&#39;m
going to get you to do again you&#39;re
going to see yellow happy faces
and a few sad blue faces these are
children in the schoolyard in Geneva
during recess during the winter most
kids are happy it&#39;s actually recess but
if your kids are sad in blue because
they&#39;ve forgotten that coat everybody
begins to move around and your task is
to keep track of whoo how to code at the
beginning and who didn&#39;t so I&#39;m just
going to show you an example where there
is only one sad kid it&#39;s easy because
you can actually track it with your eyes
you can track again track and then when
it stops and there&#39;s a question mark and
I ask you that this kid had a code or
not with it yellow initially or blue
I hear you yellow goods the most of you
have a brain I&#39;m now going to ask you to
do the task but now with a little more
challenging task they&#39;re going to be
three of them that are blue don&#39;t move
your eyes please don&#39;t know guys
keep your eyes fixated and expand pull
your attention that&#39;s the only way you
can actually do it if you move your eyes
you&#39;re doomed
yellow blue good so your typical normal
young adult can have a span of about
three or four objects of attention
that&#39;s what we just did your actual
video game player has a span of about
six to seven objects of attention which
is what is shown in this video here
that&#39;s for you guys action video game
player no more challenging right yellow
blue blue we have some people that are
serious out there yeah good so in the
same way that we actually see the
effects of video games on people&#39;s
behavior we can use brain imaging and
look at the impact of video game on the
brain and we do find many changes but
the main changes are actually to the
brain networks that control attention so
one part is a pyro cortex which is very
well known to control the orientation of
attention the other one is a frontal
lobe which controls how we sustain
attention
and another one is the enter your
singlet which controls how we are locate
and regulate attention and resolve
conflict now when we do brain imaging we
find that all three of these networks
are actually much more efficient in
people that play action games this
actually leads me to rather
counterintuitive finding in the
literature about technology in the brain
you all know about multitasking you all
have been faulty of multitasking when
you&#39;re driving and you pick up your
cellphone
bad idea very bad idea why because as
your tension shift to your cellphone you
are actually losing the capacity to
react swiftly to the car breaking in
front of you and so you&#39;re much more
likely to get engaged into a car
accident now we can measure that kind of
skills in the lab we obviously don&#39;t ask
people to drive around and see how many
car accidents they have that would be a
little costly proposition but we design
tasks on the computer where we can
measure to the millisecond accuracy how
good they are at switching from one task
to another when we do that we actually
find that people that play a lot of
action games are really really good
this switch really fast very swiftly
they pay a very small cost now I&#39;d like
you to remember that result and put it
in the context of another group of
Technology users a group which is
actually much revered by society which
are people that engage in multimedia
tasking what is not immediate asking is
the fact that most of us most of our
children are engaged in to listening to
music at the same time as a doing search
on the web at the same time a the
chatting on Facebook with their friends
that&#39;s a multimedia Tasker there was a
first study done by colleagues at
Stanford and then we replicated that
showed that those people that identify
as being high multimedia Tasker are
absolutely abysmal and multitasking when
we measure them in the lab they&#39;re
really bad right so this kind of results
really makes two main point the first
one that not all media
we&#39;re equal you can&#39;t compare the effect
of multimedia tasking and the effect of
playing action games have totally
different effects on different aspects
of cognition perception and attention
even within video games I&#39;m telling you
right now about these action-packed
videogames different video games have a
different effect on your brains so we
actually need to step into the lab and
really measure what is the effect of
each video game the other lesson is that
general wisdom carries no weight I show
that to you already like we looked at
the fact that despite a lot of screen
times those action gamers have a lot a
very good vision etc here what was
really striking is that these
undergraduates that actually report
engaging a lot of high multimedia
tasking are convinced the aced test so
you show them their data you show them
their bad and like not possible you know
they have this sort of gut feeling that
really they&#39;re doing really really good
that&#39;s another argument for why we need
to step into the lab and really measure
the impact of technology on the brain
now in a sense when we think about the
effect of video games on the brain it&#39;s
very similar back to the effect of wine
beyond the health there are some very
poor use of wine there are some very
poor use of video games but when
consumed in reasonable doses and at the
right age wine can be very good for
health there are actually specific
molecules that have been identified in
red wine as leading to greater life
expectancy so it&#39;s the same way like
those action video games have a number
of ingredients that are actually really
powerful for brain plasticity learning
attention vision etc and so we need and
we&#39;re working on understanding what are
those active ingredients so that we can
really then leverage them to deliver
better games either for education or
rehabilitation of patients now because
we&#39;re interested in having an impact for
education or reputation of patients
we&#39;re actually not that interested in
how those of you that shoes to play
video games for many hours on hand
perform I&#39;m much more interested in
taking any of you and showing that part
by forcing you to play an actual game I
can actually change your vision for the
better whether you want to play that
action game or not right that&#39;s a point
of rehabilitation or education most of
the kids don&#39;t go to schools saying
great you know two hours of math so
that&#39;s really the crux of the research
and to do that we need to go one more
step the one more step is to do training
studies so let me illustrate that step
with a task which is called mental
rotation mental rotation is a task where
I&#39;m going to ask you and again you&#39;re
going to do the task to look at this
shape study it it&#39;s a target shape and
I&#39;m going to present you four different
shapes one of these four different
shapes is actually a rotated version of
this shape I want you to tell me which
one the first one second one third one
or fourth one okay I&#39;ll help you fourth
one one more get those brains working
come on that&#39;s our target shape third
good this is hard right like the reason
I asked you to do that is because you
really fill your brain cringing right
doesn&#39;t really feel like playing a
mindless
action video games well while we doing
these training studies as people come to
the lab they do tasks like this one we
then force them to play ten hours of
action games they don&#39;t let ten hours of
action game in a row they do distributed
practice so little shots of 40 minutes
if several days over a period of two
weeks then once they are done with the
training they come back a few days later
and they are tested again on a similar
type of mental rotation task so this is
work from colleague in Toronto where
they showed is that initially you know
subjects perform where they&#39;re expected
to perform given their age after two
weeks of training on action video games
they actually perform better
and the improvement is still there five
months after having done the training
that&#39;s really really important why
because I told you we want to use these
games for education or for ability ssin
we need to have effects that are going
to be long-lasting now at this point a
number of you are probably wondering
well what are you waiting for pudding on
the market a game that would be good for
the attention of my grandmother and that
she would actually enjoy or again that
would be great to rehabilitate the
vision of my grandson who has amblyopia
for example well we&#39;re working on it but
here is a challenge there are brain
scientists like me that are beginning to
understand what are the good ingredients
in games to promote positive effects
that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to call the
broccoli side of the equation there is
an entertainment software industry which
is extremely deft at coming up with
appealing products that you can&#39;t resist
that&#39;s a chocolate side of the equation
the issues we need to put the two
together and it&#39;s a little bit like with
food who really wants to eat
chocolate-covered broccoli none of you
and you probably have had that feeling
right picking up an education game and
so filling mmm it&#39;s not really fun it&#39;s
not really engaging so what we need is
really a new brand of chocolate a brand
of chocolate that is irresistible that
you really want to play but that has all
the ingredients the Gouda gradients that
are extracted from the broccoli that you
can&#39;t recognize but are still working on
your brains and we&#39;re working on it but
it takes to come and to get together
brain scientists people that work in the
entertainment software industry and
publishers so these are not people that
usually meet every day but it&#39;s actually
doable and we are on the right track I
like to leave you with that thought and
thank you for your attention
