when I was nine years old I went off to
summer camp for the first time and my
mother packed me his suitcase full of
books which to me seemed like a
perfectly natural thing to do because in
my family reading was the primary group
activity and this might sound antisocial
to you but for us it was really just a
different way of being social
you had the animal warmth of your family
sitting right next to you but you were
also free to go roaming around the
Adventureland inside your own mind and I
had this idea that camp was going to be
just like this but better I had a vision
of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily
reading books and their matching
nightgowns camp was more like a keg
party without any alcohol and on the
very first day our counselor gathered us
all together and she taught us a cheer
that she said we would be doing every
day for the rest of the summer to
instill camp spirit and it went like
this
our owd ie that&#39;s the way we spell rowdy
rowdy rowdy
let&#39;s get rowdy yeah so I couldn&#39;t
figure out for the life of me why we
were supposed to be so rowdy or why we
had to spell this word incorrectly
but I recited the cheer I recited the
cheer along with everybody else I did my
best and I just waited for the time that
I could go off and read my books but the
first time that I took my book out of my
suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk
came up to me and she asked me why are
you being so mellow mellow of course
being the exact opposite of our owd ie
and then the second time I tried it the
counselor came up to me he was a
concerned expression on her face and she
repeated the point about camp spirit and
said we should all really work very hard
to be outgoing and so I put my books
away back in their suitcase and I put
them under my bed and there they stayed
for the rest of the summer and I felt
kind of guilty about this I felt as if
the books needed me somehow and they
were calling out to me and I was
forsaking them but I did forsake them
and I didn&#39;t open that suitcase again
until I was back home with my family at
the end of the summer now I tell you
this story about summer camp I could
have told you fifty others just like it
all the times that I got the message
that somehow my quiet and introverted
style of being was not necessarily the
right way to go and that I should be
trying to pass as more of an extrovert
and I always sense deep down that this
was wrong and that introverts were
pretty excellent just as they were but
for years I denied this intuition and so
I became a Wall Street lawyer of all
things instead of the writer that I had
always longed to be partly because I
needed to prove to myself that I could
be bold and assertive too and I was
always going off to crowded bars when I
really would have preferred to just have
a nice dinner with friends
and I made these self negating choices
so reflexively but I wasn&#39;t even aware
that I was making them now this is what
many introverts to you and it&#39;s our loss
for sure but it is also our colleagues
loss and our community&#39;s loss and at the
risk of sounding grandiose it is the
world&#39;s loss because when it comes to
creativity and to leadership we need
introverts doing what they do best a
third to a half of the population are
introverts a third to a half so that&#39;s
one out of every two or three people you
know so even if you are an extrovert you
self you know I&#39;m talking about your
co-workers and your spouses and your
children and the person sitting right
next to you right now all of them
subject to this bias that is pretty deep
and real in our society we all
internalize it from a very early age
without even having a language for what
we&#39;re doing now to see the bias clearly
you need to understand what introversion
is and it&#39;s different from being shy
shyness is about fear of social judgment
introversion is more about how do you
respond to stimulation including social
stimulation so extroverts really crave
large amounts of stimulation
whereas introverts feel at their most
alive and their most switched on and
they&#39;re most capable when they&#39;re in
quieter more low-key environments not
all the time you know these things are
an absolute but a lot of the time so the
key then to maximizing our talents is
for us all to put ourselves in the zone
of stimulation that is right for us but
now here&#39;s where the bias comes in our
most important institutions our schools
and our workplaces they are designed
mostly for extroverts and for extroverts
need for lots of stimulation and also we
are living through this belief system we
have a belief system right now that I
call the new groupthink which holds that
all creativity and all productivity
comes from a very oddly gregarious place
so if you picture the typical classroom
nowadays when I was going to school we
sat in rows you know we thought in rows
of desks like this and we did most of
our work pretty autonomously but
nowadays your typical classroom has pods
of desks - four or five or six or seven
kids all facing each other and kids are
working in countless group assignments
even in subjects like math and creative
writing which you would think would
depend on solo flights of thought kids
are now expected to act as committee
members and for the kids who prefer to
go off by themselves or just to work
alone those kids are seen as outliers
often or worse as problem cases and the
vast majority of teachers reports
believing that the ideal student is an
extrovert as opposed to an introvert
even though introverts actually get
better grades and are more knowledgeable
according to according to research
okay same thing is true in our
workplaces we now most of us work in
open-plan offices without walls where we
are subject to the constant noise and
gaze of our co-workers and when it comes
to leadership introverts are routinely
passed over for leadership positions
even though introverts tend to be very
careful much less likely to take
outsides risks which is something we
might all favor nowadays and an
interesting research by Adam grant at
the Wharton School has found that
introverted leaders often deliver better
outcomes than extroverts to you because
when they are managing proactive
employees they&#39;re much more likely to
let those employees run with their ideas
whereas an extrovert can quite
unwittingly get so excited about about
things that they&#39;re putting their own
stamp on things and other people&#39;s ideas
might not as easily then bubble up to
the surface now in fact some of our
transformative leaders in history have
been introverts I&#39;ll give you some
examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks
Gandhi all these people described
themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and
even shy and they all took the spotlight
even though every bone in their bodies
was telling them not to and this turns
out to have a special power all its own
because people could feel that these
leaders were at the helm not because
they enjoyed directing others and not
out of the pleasure of being looked at
they were there because they had no
choice because they were driven to do
what they thought was right now I think
at this point it&#39;s important for me to
say that I actually love extroverts I
always like to say some of my best
friends are extroverts including my
beloved husband and we all fall at
different points of course along the
introvert extrovert spectrum you know
even Carl Jung the psychologist who
first popularized these terms said that
there&#39;s no such thing as a pure
introvert or a pure extrovert
he said that such a man would be an
Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all
and some people fall smack in the middle
of the introvert extrovert spectrum and
we call these people ambiverts and I
often think that they have the best of
all worlds but many of us do recognize
ourselves as one type or the other and
what I&#39;m saying is that culturally we
need a much better balance we mean we
need more of a yin and yang between
these two types
now this is especially important when it
comes to creativity into productivity
because when psychologists look at the
lives have the most creative people what
they find are people who are very good
at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas
but who also have a serious streak of
introversion in them and this is because
solitude is a crucial ingredient often
to creativity so Darwin knew he took
long walks alone in the woods and
emphatically turned down dinner party
invitations see you dork I sell better
known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of
his amazing creations in a lonely
belltower office that he had in the back
of his house in La Jolla California and
he was actually afraid to meet the young
children who read his books for fear
that they were expecting him to be this
kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure
and would be disappointed with his more
reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented
the first Apple computer sitting alone
in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where
he was working at the time and he says
that he never would have become such an
expert in the first place had he not
been too introverted to leave the house
when he was growing up now
of course this does not mean that we
should all stop collaborating and Kayson
point is Steve Wozniak famously coming
together with Steve Jobs to start Apple
Computer but it does mean that solitude
matters and that for some people it is
the air that they breathe and in fact we
have known for centuries about the
transcendent power of solitude it&#39;s only
recently that we&#39;ve strangely begun to
forget it if you look at most of the
world&#39;s major religions you will find
seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad
seekers who are going off by themselves
alone to the wilderness where they then
have profound epiphanies and revelations
that they then bring back to the rest of
the community
so no wilderness no revelations this is
no surprise though if you look at the
insights of contemporary psychology you
know it turns out that we can&#39;t even be
in a group of people without
instinctively mirroring and mimicking
their opinions even about seemingly
personal and visceral things like who
you&#39;re attracted to
you will start aping the beliefs of the
people around you without even realizing
that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing and groups
famously follow the opinions of the most
dominant or charismatic person in the
room even though there&#39;s zero
correlation between being the best
talker and having the best ideas I mean
zero so you might be following the
person with the best ideas but you might
not and do you really want to leave it
up to chance much better for everybody
to go off by themselves generate their
own ideas freed from the distortions of
group dynamics and then come together as
a team to talk some through in a will
manage environment and take it from
there now if all this is true then why
are we getting it so wrong why are we
setting up our schools this way in our
workplaces and why are we making these
introverts feel so guilty about wanting
to just go off by themselves some of the
time
one answer lies deep in our cultural
history Western societies and in
particular the US have always favored
the man of action over the man of
contemplation and man of contemplation
but in the you know in America&#39;s early
days we lived in what historians call a
culture of character where we still at
that point valued people for their inner
selves and their moral rectitude and if
you look at the self-help books from
this era as they all had titles with
things like character the grandest thing
in the world and they featured role
models like Abraham Lincoln who was
praised for being modest and unassuming
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who
does not offend by superiority but then
we hit the twentieth century and we
entered a new culture that historians
call the culture of personality you know
what happened is we had evolved from an
agricultural economy to a world of big
business and so suddenly people are
moving from small towns to the cities
and instead of working alongside people
they&#39;ve known all their lives now they
are having to prove themselves at a
crowd of strangers
so quite understandably quality is like
magnetism and charisma suddenly come to
seem really important I&#39;m sure enough
the self-help books change to meet these
new needs and they start to have names
like how to win friends and influence
people and they feature as their role
models really great sales
so that&#39;s the world we&#39;re living in
today that&#39;s our cultural inheritance
now none of this is to say that social
skills are unimportant and I&#39;m also not
calling for the abolishing of teamwork
at all you know the same religions who
send their sages off to lonely
mountaintops also teach us love and
trust and the problems that we are
facing today and fields like science and
in economics are so vast and so complex
that we are going to need armies of
people coming together to solve them
working together but I am saying that
the more freedom that we give introverts
to be themselves the more likely that
they are to come up with their own
unique solutions to these problems so
now I&#39;d like to share with you what&#39;s in
my suitcase today guess what books have
a suitcase full of books
here&#39;s Margaret Atwood cat&#39;s-eye here&#39;s
a novel by Milan Kundera
and here&#39;s the guide of the perplexed by
Maimonides but these are not exactly my
books I brought these books with me
because they were written by my
grandfather&#39;s favorite authors my
grandfather was a rabbi and he was a
widower who lived alone in a small
apartment in Brooklyn that was my
favorite place in the world when I was
growing up partly because it was filled
with his very gentle very courtly
presence and partly because it was
filled with books I mean literally every
table every chair in this apartment had
yielded its original function to now
serve as a surface for swaying stacks of
books just like the rest of my family my
grandfather&#39;s favorite thing to do in
the world was to read but he also loved
his congregation and you could feel this
love in the sermons that he gave every
week for the 62 years that he was a
rabbi he would take the fruits of each
week&#39;s reading and he would weave these
intricate tapestries of ancient and
humanist thought and people would come
from all over to hear him speak but
here&#39;s the thing about my grandfather
underneath his ceremonial role he was
really modest and really
introverted so much so that when he
delivered these sermons he had trouble
making eye contact with a very same
congregation that he had been speaking
to you for 62 years and even away from
the podium when you called him to say
hello he would often end the
conversation prematurely for fear that
he was taking up too much of your time
but when he died at the age of 94 the
police had to close down the streets of
his neighborhood to accommodate the
crowd of people who came out to mourn
him and so these days I try to learn
from my grandfather&#39;s example in my own
way so I just published a book about
introversion and it took me about seven
years to write and for me that seven
years was like total bliss because you
know I was reading I was writing I was
thinking I was researching it was my
version of my grandfather&#39;s hours a day
alone in his library but now all of a
sudden my job is very different and my
job is to be out here talking about it
talking about introversion
and that&#39;s a lot harder for me because
as honored as I am to be here with all
of you right now this is not my natural
milieu so I prepared for moments like
these as best I could I spent the last
year practicing public speaking every
chance I could get and I called this my
year of speaking dangerously and that
actually helped a lot but I&#39;ll tell you
what helps even more is my sense my
belief my hope that when it comes to our
attitudes to introversion and to quiet
and to solitude we truly are poised on
the brink of dramatic change I mean we
are and so I am going to leave you now
with three calls for action for those
who share this vision number one stop
the madness for constant group work just
stop it
thank you and I want to be clear about
what I&#39;m saying because I believe our
offices should be encouraging casual
chatty cafe style types of interactions
you know the kind where people come
together and serendipitously have an
exchange of ideas that is great that&#39;s
great for introverts and it&#39;s great for
extroverts but we need much more privacy
and much more freedom much more autonomy
at work school same thing we need to be
teaching kids to work together for sure
but we also need to be teaching them how
to work on their own this is especially
important for extroverted children too
they need to work on their own because
that is where deep thought comes from in
part okay number two go to the
wilderness be like Buddha have your own
revelations I&#39;m not saying that we all
have to now go off and build our own
cabins in the woods and never talk to
each other again but I am saying that we
could all stand to unplug and get inside
our own heads a little more often number
three take a good look at what&#39;s inside
your own suitcase and why you put it
there so extroverts maybe your suitcases
are also full of books or maybe they&#39;re
full of champagne glasses or skydiving
equipment whatever it is I hope you take
these things out every chance you get at
grace us with your energy and your joy
but introverts you being you you
probably have the impulse to guard very
carefully what&#39;s inside your own
suitcase and that&#39;s okay but
occasionally just occasionally I hope
you will open up your suitcases for
other people to see because the world
needs you and it needs the things you
carry so I wish you the best of all
possible journeys and the courage to
speak softly thank you very much
thank you
you
