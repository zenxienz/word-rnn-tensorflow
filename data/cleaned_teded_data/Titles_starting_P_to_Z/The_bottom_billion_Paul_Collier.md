so can we dare to be optimistic
well the thesis of the bottom billion is
that a billion people have been stopped
living in economies that have been
stagnant for 40 years and hence
diverging from the rest of mankind and
so the real question to pose is not can
we be optimistic it&#39;s how can we give
credible hope to that billion people
that to my mind is the fundamental
challenge now of development what I&#39;m
going to offer you is a recipe a
combination of the two forces that
change the world for good which is the
Alliance of compassion and then lighten
self-interest compassion because a
billion people are living in societies
that have not offered credible hope that
is a human tragedy enlightened
self-interest because if that economic
divergence continues for another forty
years combined with social integration
globally it will build a nightmare for
our children we need compassion to get
ourselves started an enlightened
self-interest to get ourselves serious
that&#39;s the Alliance that changes the
world so what does it mean to get
serious about providing hope for the
bottom billion what can we actually do
well a good guide is to think what did
we do last time the rich world got
serious about developing another region
of the world that gives us turns out
quite a good clue
except you have to go back quite a long
time the last time the rich world got
serious about developing another region
was in the late 1940s the rich world was
you America and the region that needed
to be developed was my world Europe that
was post-war Europe why did America get
serious it wasn&#39;t just compassion for
Europe though there was that it was you
knew you had to because in the late
nineteen forties country after country
in Central Europe was falling into the
Soviet bloc and so you knew you&#39;d no
choice Europe had to be dragged into
economic development so what did you do
last time you got serious well yes you
had a big aid program thank you very
much that was marshal aid we need to do
it again aid is part of the solution but
what else did you do
well you tore up your trade policy and
totally reversed it before the war
America had been highly protectionist
after the war you open your markets to
Europe you dragged Europe into the then
global economy which was your economy
and you institutionalize that trade
liberalisation through founding the
general agreement of tariffs and trade
so total reversal of trade policy did
you do anything else yes you totally
reversed your security policy before the
war your security policy had been
isolationist after the war you tear that
up you put a hundred thousand troops in
Europe for over 40 years
so total reversal of security policy
anything else yes you tear up the
eleventh commandment
national sovereignty before the war you
treated national sovereignty as so
sacrosanct that you weren&#39;t even willing
to join the League of Nations after the
war
you found the United Nations you found
the organisation for economic
operation and development you found the
IMF you encouraged Europe to create the
European community all systems for
mutual governance support that is still
the waterfront of effective policies aid
trade security governance of course the
details of policy are going to be
different because the challenge is
different it&#39;s not rebuilding Europe
it&#39;s with reversing the divergence of
the bottom billion so that they actually
catch up is that easier or harder we
need to be at least as serious as we
were there now today I&#39;m going to take
just one of those four I&#39;m going to take
the one that sounds the weakest the one
that&#39;s just motherhood and apple pie
governance mutual systems of support for
governance and I&#39;m going to show you one
idea in how we could do something to
strengthen governance and I&#39;m going to
show you that that is enormous ly
important now the opportunity we&#39;re
going to look to is is a genuine basis
for optimism about the bottom billion
and that is the commodity booms the
commodity booms are pumping
unprecedented amounts of money into many
they are not all of the countries of the
bottom billion partly they&#39;re pumping
money in because commodity prices are
high
but it&#39;s not just that there&#39;s also a
range of new discoveries
Uganda&#39;s just discovered oil and about
the most disastrous location on earth
Ghana&#39;s discovered oil Guinea has got a
huge new exploit exploitation of iron
ore coming out of ground so mass of new
discoveries between them these new
revenue flows draw
aid just to give you one at one example
and Golar alone is getting fifty billion
dollars a year in oil revenue the entire
aid flows to the sixty countries of the
bottom billion last year
with thirty four billion so the the the
flow of resources from the commodity
booms to the bottom billion are without
precedent so there&#39;s the optimism
question is how is it going to help
their development it&#39;s a huge
opportunity for transformational
development will it be taken so here
comes a bit of science and this is a bit
of science I&#39;ve done since the bottom
billion so it&#39;s new I&#39;ve looked to see
what is the relationship between higher
commodity prices of exports and the
growth of commodity exporting countries
and I&#39;ve not globally I&#39;ve taken all the
countries in the world for the last
forty years and look to see what the
relationship is and the short run so the
first five to seven years is just great
in fact it&#39;s hunky-dory everything goes
up to get more money because he terms a
trade will improve but also that drives
up output across the board so GDP goes
up a lot fantastic
that&#39;s the short-run and how about a
long-run come back fifteen years later
well the short-run it&#39;s hunky-dory
that the long run it&#39;s Humpty Dumpty you
go up in the short run but then most
societies historically have ended up
worse than if they&#39;d had Nobles at all
that is not a forecast about how
commodity prices go it&#39;s a forecast of
the consequences the long-term
consequences for growth of an increase
in prices so what goes wrong why is
there this resource curses is called
and again I looked at that and it turns
out that the critical issue is the level
of governance the initial level of
economic
and when there is all spoons accrue in
fact if you&#39;ve got good enough
governance there is no resource boom you
go up in the short term and then you go
up even more in the long term that&#39;s no
way the richest country in Europe it&#39;s
Australia it&#39;s Canada the resource curse
is entirely confined to countries below
a threshold of governance they still go
up in the short run that&#39;s what we&#39;re
seeing across the bottom billion at the
moment the best growth rates they&#39;ve had
ever and the question is whether the
short run will persist with bad
governance historically over the last 40
years it hasn&#39;t countries like Nigeria
which are worse off than if they&#39;d never
had oil so there&#39;s a threshold level
above which you go up in the long term
below which you go down just a benchmark
that threshold it&#39;s about the governance
level of Portugal in the mid-1980s so
the question is are the bottom billion
above or below that threshold now
there&#39;s one big change since the
commodity booms of the 1970s and that is
the spread of democracy so I thought
well maybe that is the thing which is
transformed governance in the bottom
billion maybe we can be more optimistic
because of the spread of democracy so I
looked democracy does have significant
effects and unfortunately their adverse
democracies make even more of a mess of
these resorts films than autocracies at
that stage I just wanted to abandon the
research but
it turns out that democracy is a little
bit more complicated than that because
through two distinct aspects of
democracy
there&#39;s electoral competition which
disturbance how you acquire power and
the checks and balances which determine
how you use power it turns out that
electoral competition is the thing
that&#39;s doing the damage with democracy
where are strong checks and balances
make resource problems good and so what
the countries of the bottom billion need
is very strong checks and balances they
haven&#39;t got them they got instant
democracy in the 1990s elections without
checks and balances how can we help
improve governance and introduce checks
and balances in all the societies of the
bottom billion there are intense
struggles to do just that
the simple proposal is that we should
have some international standards which
will be voluntary but which would spell
out the key decision points the need to
be taken in order for to harness these
resource revenues we know these
international standards work because
we&#39;ve already got one it&#39;s called the
extractive industries transparency
initiative that is the very simple idea
that governments should report to their
citizens
what revenues they have no sooner was it
proposed than reformers in Nigeria
adopted it pushed it had published the
revenues in the paper
Nigerian newspaper circulation spiked
people wanted to know what their
government was getting in terms of
revenue so we know it works
what would the content be of these
international standards I can&#39;t go
through all of them but I&#39;ll give you an
example the first is how to take the
resources out of the ground the economic
process is taking the resources out of
the ground and putting assets on top of
the ground and the first step in that is
selling the rights to resource
extraction you know how rights resource
extraction are being sold at the moment
how they&#39;ve been sold over the last
14 years a company flies in does a deal
with a minister and that&#39;s great for the
company and it&#39;s quite often great for
the minister and it&#39;s not great for the
country there&#39;s a very simple
institutional technology which can
transform that and it&#39;s called verified
auctions the public agency with the
greatest expertise on earth is of course
the Treasury that is the British
Treasury and the British Treasury
decided that it would sell the rights to
third generation mobile phones by
working out what those rights were worth
now it worked out they were worth two
billion pounds just in time a set of
economists got there and said why not
try an auction it&#39;ll reveal the value it
went for twenty billion pounds through
auction if the British Treasury can be
out by a factor of ten think what the
Ministry of Finance in Sierra Leone is
going to be like when I put that from
the president of Sierra Leone the next
day yes the World Bank descend on the
team to give expertise on how to conduct
auctions there are five such decision
points each one needs an international
standard if we could do it we would
change the world we would be helping the
Reformers in these societies who are
struggling for change that our modest
role we cannot change these societies
but we can help the people in these
societies who are struggling and usually
failing because the odds are so stacked
against them and yet we&#39;ve not got these
rules if you think about it the cost of
promulgating international rules is SIL
CH nothing why on earth are they not
there I realized the reason they&#39;re not
there is that until we have a critical
mass of informed citizens in our own
societies politicians will get away with
gestures the
that unless we have an informed society
what politicians do especially in
relation to Africa is gestures things
that look good but don&#39;t work and so I
realized we had to go through the
business of building an informed
citizenry that&#39;s why I broke all the
professional rules of conduct for an
economist and I wrote an economics book
that you could read on a beach however I
have to say the process of communication
does not come naturally to me this is
why I on this stage but it&#39;s alarming
right I grew up in a culture of
self-effacement and my wife showed me a
blog comment on one of my last talks and
the blog comment said Collier is not
charismatic
but his arguments are compelling if
if you agree with that sentiment and if
you agree that we need a critical mass
of informed citizenry you will realize
that I need you please become
ambassadors thank
you
