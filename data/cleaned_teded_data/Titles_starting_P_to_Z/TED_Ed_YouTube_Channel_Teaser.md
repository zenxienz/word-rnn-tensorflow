Right now, somewhere out there,
an educator is delivering
a mind-altering lesson to their class.
I want to engage your brains in this.

Chris Anderson: I tried to get
my head around how vast our Earth is.

Logan Smalley: The lesson only reaches
the students in that room.
What would happen if we captured it?
It&#39;s a toothed wheel.

LS: What if pro animators
and visualization artists
could bring that lesson to life?

CA: It&#39;s a common object
that literally fits one million Earths.
It&#39;s got a bunch of notches
and a bunch of teeth.
This was Fizeau&#39;s solution --

LS: When that lesson lands,
curiosity is ignited.

CA: It seems impossibly big.

AS: Something interesting happens.

CA: In the great scheme
of things, it&#39;s a pinprick.

AS: A door closes on the light beam
that&#39;s coming back to his eye.

LS: Then that group of students
is one thought closer
to being what every teacher

hopes their students will become:
a lifelong learner.

AS: Based on the distance
between the two stations --

CA: The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull.

AS: He calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value.

CA: The more you know,
the more amazing the world seems.

That&#39;s the central mission of TED-Ed:
to capture and to amplify
the voice of the world&#39;s
greatest teachers.
He does this in 1849.

CA: It&#39;s the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions,
that pull us forward.
So stay curious.
