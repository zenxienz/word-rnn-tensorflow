so this game is very simple all you have
to do is read what you see right so I&#39;m
going to count you so we do it all to it
all do it together okay one two three
amazing what about this one one two
three all right one two three
if you were Portuguese all right how
about this one one two three
what are you reading there are no words
there I said read what you&#39;re seeing
right literary says what are eating
right that&#39;s what you should have said
right why is this is because perception
is grounded in our experience right the
brain takes meaningless information and
makes meaning out of it which means we
never see what&#39;s there we never see
information we only ever see what was
useful to see in the past right which
means when it comes to perception we&#39;re
all like this frog all right it&#39;s
getting information as general behavior
that&#39;s useful
and sometimes when things don&#39;t go our
way we get a little bit annoyed right
but we&#39;re talking about perception here
right and perception underpins
everything we think we know we believe
our hopes our dreams the clothes we wear
falling in love everything begins with
perception now if perception is grounded
in our history it means we&#39;re only ever
responding according to what we&#39;ve done
before but that creates a tremendous
problem because how can we ever see
differently now I want to tell you a
story about seeing differently and all
new perceptions begin in the same way
they begin with a question the problem
with questions is they create
uncertainty now uncertainty is a very
bad thing its evolutionary a bad thing
if you&#39;re not sure that&#39;s a predator
it&#39;s too late okay even seasickness is a
consequence of uncertainty right if you
go down below in a boat your inner ears
are telling you removing your eyes
because it&#39;s moving in register with a
boat say I&#39;m standing still your brain
cannot deal with the uncertainty of that
information and it gets ill the question
why is one of the most dangerous things
you can do because it takes you into
uncertainty and yet the iron is the only
way we can ever do anything new is to
step into that space so how can we ever
do anything new well fortunately
evolution has given us an answer right
and it enables us to address even the
most difficult of questions the best
questions are the ones that create the
most uncertainty the ones that question
the things we think to be true already
right it&#39;s easy to ask questions about
how did life begin or what extends
beyond the universe but the question
what you think to be true already is
really stepping into that space so what
is evolutions answer to the problem of
uncertainty it&#39;s playing now play is not
simply a process experts until in play
will tell you that actually it&#39;s a way
of being play is one of the only human
endeavors where uncertainty is actually
celebrated
and certainly is what makes play fun
right it&#39;s adaptable to change right it
opens possibility and it&#39;s cooperative
it&#39;s actually how we do our social
bonding and it&#39;s intrinsically motivated
what that means is that we play to play
plays its own reward now if you look at
these five ways of being these are the
exact same ways of being you need in
order to be a good scientist science is
not defined by the methods section of a
paper it&#39;s actually a way of being which
is here and this is true for anything
that is creative so if you add rules to
play you have a game that&#39;s actually
what an experiment is so armed with
these two ideas that science is a way of
being and experiments are play we asked
can anyone become a scientist and who
better to ask than 25 8 to 10 year old
children because they&#39;re experts in play
so i took my be arena down to a small
school in devon and the aim of this was
to not just get the kids to see science
differently but through the process of
science to see themselves differently
right the first step was to ask a
question now i should say that we didn&#39;t
get funding for this study because that
scientists said small children could
make useful contribution to science and
the teacher said kids couldn&#39;t do it so
we did it anyway right of course so here
are some of the questions I put them in
small print so you wouldn&#39;t bother
reading it point is that five of the
questions that the kids came up with or
actually the basis of science
publication the last five to 15 years
right so they were asking questions that
were significant to expert scientists
now here i want to share the stage with
someone quite special right she was one
of the young people was involved in a
study and she&#39;s now one of the youngest
published scientists in the world right
she will now once she comes onto stage
will be the youngest person to ever
speak it Ted right now science and
asking questions about courage now she
is the personification of courage
because she&#39;s going to stand up here and
talk to you all so Amy would you please
come up
so Amy&#39;s going to help me tell the story
what we call the black cotton bees
project and first he&#39;s going to tell you
the question that they came up with so
go ahead Amy thank you babe we thought
those easy to see the link between
humans and apes in the way that we think
because we look like but we wondered if
there&#39;s a possible link with other
animals it&#39;d be amazing if humans and
these thought similar since they seem so
different from us so we asked a few mins
of bees myself complex problems in the
same way really who owns a note of bees
can also adapt themselves to new
situations using previous learn rules
and conditions so what if bees can think
like us well it&#39;d be amazing since we&#39;re
talking about insect with only 1 million
brain cells but actually makes a lot of
sense they should because beers like us
connect and as a good foul regardless of
the time of day the light the weather or
from any angle approaching from so next
step was to design an experiment which
is a game so the kids went off and they
designed this experiment and so that
will gain and so Amy can you tell us
what the game was in the puzzle that you
set the bees the puzzle we came up with
wasn&#39;t if then we&#39;ll we has to be stolen
not just to go to a certain color but to
a certain color flower only when it&#39;s in
a certain pattern there were only
rewarded if they went to the yellow
flowers if the yellow flowers was
surrounded by the blue or if the blue
flowers was surrounded by the yellow now
there&#39;s a number of different rules the
bezel Lance of the suppose oh the
interesting question is which what was
really exciting about this project was
we and Bo had no idea whether it was
work it&#39;s completely new and no one had
done before including adults
including the teachers and that was
really hard for the teachers it&#39;s easy
for a scientist score and not have a
clue what he&#39;s doing because that&#39;s what
we do in the lab but for a teacher not
to know what&#39;s going to happen at the
end of the day so much of the credit
goes to Dave Strudwick who is the
collaborator on this project ok so I&#39;m
not going to go through the whole
details of the study because actually
you can read it read about it but the
next step is observation so here are
some of the students doing the
observations the recording the data of
where the bees fly so you need to try
can you help me I do what good scientist
says that right right so we&#39;ve got our
observations we&#39;ve got our data they do
the simple mathematics averaging etc etc
and now we want to share that&#39;s the next
step so we&#39;re going to write this up and
try to submit this for publication right
so we have to write it up so we go of
course to the pub all right the one on
the left is mine okay now I tell them a
paper has four different sections and
introduction of methods a results a
discussion the introduction says what&#39;s
the question in why methods what did you
do results what was an observation and
the discussion is who cares right that&#39;s
a science paper basically so the kids
give me the words right I put it into a
narrative which means that this paper is
written in kids speak it&#39;s not run by me
is written by Amy and the other students
in the class as a consequence the
science paper begins once upon a time
the results section it says training
phase the puzzle done right and the
methods it says then we put the bees
into the fridge and maybe pie smiley
face right this is a science paper we&#39;re
going to try to get it published so
here&#39;s the title page we have a number
of authors they&#39;re all the ones in bold
are eight to ten years old the first
author is black on primary school
because the forever reference it would
be black Walton at all and not when
individuals so we submit it to a public
access journal and it says this said
many things but it said this I&#39;m afraid
the paper fails our initial quality
control checks in several different ways
in others it starts off was by the time
the figures in crayon etc so we decided
we&#39;ll get it reviewed so I send it to
Dale Purvis who&#39;s the National Academy
of Science when a leading neuro
scientists in the world and he says this
is the most original scientific paper
I&#39;ve ever read and it certainly deserves
wide exposure Larry and Maloney expert
envision says the papers magnificent the
work would be publishable if done by
adults so what do we do we send it back
to the editor they say no so we asked
Larry and Natalie to hempel to write a
commentary situating the findings for
scientists right putting in the
references and we submit it to biology
letters and there it was reviewed by
five independent referees and it was
published okay
it took four months to do the science
two years to get it published typical
science actually right so this makes Amy
and her friends the youngest published
scientists in the world what was the
feedback like well it was published two
days before Christmas downloaded 30,000
times in the first day right it was
editor&#39;s choice in science which is a
top science magazine it&#39;s forever freely
accessible by biology versus only paper
that will ever be freely accessible by
this journal last year was the second
most downloaded paper by biology letters
and the feedback from not just
scientists and teachers but the public
as well and I&#39;ll just read one I have
red black cotton bees recently I don&#39;t
have words to explain exactly how I&#39;m
feeling right now what you guys have
done is real true and amazing curiosity
interest innocence and zeal are the most
basic most important things to do
science who else can have these
qualities more than children please
congratulate your children&#39;s team from
my side so I&#39;d like to conclude with a
physical metaphor can I do it on you oh
yeah come on yeah yeah okay now science
is about taking risks so this is a
credible risk right for me not for him
right because we&#39;ve only done this once
before
and you like technology right all right
so this is the myself this is a pity me
of technology right okay now okay now
we&#39;re going to do a little demonstration
right you have to close your eyes and
you have to point where you hear me
clapping alright okay how about if
everyone over there shouts one two three
really now open your eyes we&#39;ll do it
one more time everyone over there shout
where&#39;s the sound coming from
thank you very much what&#39;s the point the
point is what science does for us right
we normally walk through life responding
but if we ever want to do anything
differently has to step into uncertainty
when he opened his eyes he was able to
see the world in a new way that&#39;s what
science offers us it offers the
possibility to step on uncertainty
through the process of play right now
true science education I think should be
about giving people a voice and enabling
to express that voice so I&#39;ve asked Amy
to be the last voice in this short story
so Amy this project was really exciting
for me because it brought the process of
discovery to life they show me that
anyone and I mean anyone has a potential
to discover something new I let a small
question coming into a big discovery
change in a way a person thinks about
something can be easy or hard it all
depends in the way the person feels
about change it changes way I thought
about science was surprisingly easy once
you&#39;ve played the games and then started
to think about the puzzle I then
realized that science isn&#39;t just a
boring subject and that anyone can
discover something new you just need an
opportunity my opportunity came in form
of both and the black autumn be project
thanks
