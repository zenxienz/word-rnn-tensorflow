so I&#39;m going to talk about work
specifically why people can&#39;t seem to
get work done at work which is a problem
we all kind of have let&#39;s sort of start
at the beginning so we have companies
and nonprofits and charities and all
these groups that have employees or
volunteers of some sort and they expect
these people who work for them to do
great work
I would hope at least at least good work
let&#39;s hopefully at least it&#39;s good work
hopefully great work and so what they
typically do is they decide that all
these people need to come together in
one place to do that work so a company
or a charity or organization of any kind
they typically unless you&#39;re you&#39;re
working in Africa if you&#39;re really lucky
to do that most people have to go to an
office every day and so these companies
they build offices they go out and they
buy a building or they rent a building
or they leave some space and they fill
the space with stuff they fill it with
tables or desks chairs computer
equipment software internet access maybe
a fridge maybe a few other things and
they expect their employees or their
volunteers to come to that location
every day to do great work it seems like
it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to ask that
however if you actually talk to people
and even question yourself and you ask
yourself where do you really want to go
when you really need to get something
done you&#39;ll find out that people don&#39;t
say what businesses think they would say
if you ask people the question where do
you really need to go we need to get
something done typically get three
different kinds of answers one is kind
of a place or location or room another
one is a a moving object and a third is
a time so here&#39;s some examples when I
ask people I&#39;ve been asking people this
question for about ten years I ask them
where do you go when you really need to
get something done I&#39;ll hear things like
the porch the deck the kitchen I&#39;ll hear
things like an extra room in the house
the basement the coffee shop the library
and then you&#39;ll hear things like the
Train a plane
car so the commute and then you&#39;ll hear
people say well it doesn&#39;t really matter
where I am as long as it&#39;s really early
in the morning or really late at night
or on the weekends you almost never hear
someone say the office but businesses
are spending all this money on this
place called the office and they&#39;re
making people go to it all the time and
people don&#39;t do work in the office what
is that about
like why is that why is that happening
and what you find out is if you dig a
little bit deeper you find out that
people this is what happens people go to
work and they&#39;re basically trading in
their workday for a series of work
moments that&#39;s what happens at the
office you don&#39;t have a workday anymore
you have work moments it&#39;s like the
front door of the office is like a
Cuisinart and you walk in and your day
is shredded to bits because you have 15
minutes here and 30 minutes there and
then something else happens and you&#39;re
pulled off your work and you&#39;ve got to
do something else and you have 20
minutes then it&#39;s lunch then you have
something else to do and you got 15
minutes and someone pulls you aside and
ask you this question and before you

know what it&#39;s like it&#39;s 5:00 p.m. right
and you look back on your day and you
realize that you didn&#39;t get anything
done right I mean we&#39;ve all been through
this we probably been through it we&#39;re
probably went through it yesterday or
the day before the day before that you
look back on your day and you&#39;re like I
got nothing done today I was at work i
sat at my desk I used my expensive
computer
I used the software they told me to use
I went to these meetings I was asked to
go to I did these conference calls I did
all this stuff but I didn&#39;t actually do
anything I just did tax I didn&#39;t
actually get meaningful work done and
what you what you find is that
especially with creative people
designers programmers writers engineers
thinkers that people really need long
stretches of uninterrupted time to get
something done you cannot ask somebody
to be creative in 15 minutes and really
think about a problem you might have a
quick idea but to be in deep thought
about a problem and really consider a
problem carefully you need long
stretches of uninterrupted time and even
though the work day is typically eight
hours how many people here have ever had
eight hours of themselves at the office
about seven hours six five
for when&#39;s the last time you had three
hours to yourself at the office two
hours one maybe very very few people
actually have long stretches of under up
to time at an office and this is why
people choose to do work at home or they
might go to the office but they might go
to the office really early in the day or
late at night when no one&#39;s around or
they stick around whenever after
everyone&#39;s left or they go in on the
weekends or they get work done on the
plane or they get work done in the car
on the train because there are no
distractions now there are different
kinds of distractions but there aren&#39;t
the really bad kind of distractions
which I&#39;ll talk about in just a minute
and this sort of whole phenomenon of
having like short bursts of time to get
things done reminds me of another thing
that doesn&#39;t work when you&#39;re
interrupted and that is sleep I think
that sleep and work are very closely
related and it&#39;s not just that you can
work while you&#39;re sleeping and you can
sleep while you&#39;re working that&#39;s not
really what I mean I&#39;m talking
specifically about the fact that sleep
and work are phase based or stage based
events so sleep is about sleep phases or
stages some people call them different
things there&#39;s five of them and in order
to get to the really deep ones they&#39;re
really meaningful ones you have to go
through the early ones and if you&#39;re
interrupted while you&#39;re going through
the early ones so if you know someone
bumps you in bed or there&#39;s a sound or
whatever happens you don&#39;t just pick up
where you left off if you&#39;re interrupted
and woken up you have to start again so
you have to go back a few phases and
start again and what ends up happening
sometimes you might have days like this

where you wake up at 8:00 in the morning

or 7:00 in the morning or whenever you
get up and you&#39;re like man I didn&#39;t
really sleep very well I did the sleep
thing I went to bed I laid down but I
didn&#39;t really sleep because sleep is not
people say you go to sleep but you
really don&#39;t go to sleep you go towards
sleep it just takes a while you got to
go through these phases and stuff and if
you&#39;re interrupted you don&#39;t sleep well
so how do we expect what does anyone
here expect someone to sleep well if
they&#39;re interrupted all night I don&#39;t
think anyone would say yes why do we
expect people to work well if they&#39;re
being interrupted all day at the office
how can we possibly expect people to do
their job if they&#39;re going to the office
to be interrupted that doesn&#39;t really
seem like it makes a lot of sense to me
so what are these interruptions that
happen at the
that don&#39;t happen other places because
in other places you can have
interruptions like you can have you know
the TV or you know you could go for a
walk or there&#39;s a fridge downstairs or
you&#39;ve got your own couch or whatever
you want to do and if you talk to
certain managers they&#39;ll tell you that
they don&#39;t want their employees to work
at home because of these distractions
you know they&#39;ll also say that sometimes
they&#39;ll also say well if I can&#39;t see the
person how do I know they&#39;re working
which is ridiculous of course but that&#39;s
one of the excuses that managers give
and I&#39;m one of these managers I
understand like I I know how this goes
we all have to improve on this sort of
thing but often times they&#39;ll cite
distractions I can&#39;t let someone work at
home to watch TV they&#39;ll do this other
thing
it turns out that those aren&#39;t the
things that are really distracting
because those are voluntary distractions
you decide when you want to be
distracted by the TV you decide when you
want to turn something on you decide
when you want to go downstairs or go for
a walk at the office most of the
interruptions and distractions that
really cause people not to get worked on
are involuntary so let&#39;s go through a
couple of those now managers and bosses
will often have you think that the real
distractions at work are things like
Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and
other websites and in fact they&#39;ll go so
far as to actually ban these sites at
work some of you may work at places
where you can&#39;t get to these certain
sites I mean is this China what the hell
is going on here you can&#39;t go to a
website at work and that&#39;s the problem
that&#39;s why people are getting work done
because they&#39;re going to Facebook and
they&#39;re going to Twitter that&#39;s kind of
ridiculous it&#39;s a total decoy and you
know today&#39;s Facebook and Twitter and
YouTube these things are just modern-day
smoke breaks no one cared about letting
people take a smoke break for fifteen
minutes ten years ago so why is everyone
care about someone going to Facebook
here and their Twitter here and their
YouTube here and there those aren&#39;t the
real problems in the office the real
problems are what I like to call the mms
the managers and the meetings those are
the real problems in the modern office
today and this is why things don&#39;t get
done at work it&#39;s because of the MMS now
what&#39;s interesting is if you listen to
all the places that people talk about
doing work like at home or in the car or
on a plane or late at night or early in
the morning
you don&#39;t find managers and meetings you
find a lot of other distractions but you
don&#39;t find managers in meetings so these
are the things that you don&#39;t find
elsewhere but you do find at the office
and managers are basically people whose
job it is is to interrupt people that&#39;s
pretty much what managers are for
they&#39;re for interrupting people they
don&#39;t really do the work so they have to
make sure everyone else is doing the
work which is an interruption and and we
have a lot of managers in the world now
and there&#39;s a lot of people in the world
now and there&#39;s a lot of interruptions
in the world now because of these
managers they have to check-in hey how&#39;s
it going show me what&#39;s up I know this
is the sort of thing and they keep
interrupting you at the wrong time while
you&#39;re trying to actually do something
that they&#39;re paying you to do they tend
to interrupt you that&#39;s kind of bad but
what&#39;s even worse is the thing that
managers do most of all which is called
meetings and meetings are just toxic
terrible poisonous things during the day
at work we all know this to be true and
you would never see a spontaneous
meeting called by employees it doesn&#39;t
work that way it&#39;s like the manager
calls the meeting so the employees can
all come together and it&#39;s an incredibly
disruptive thing to do to people is to
say hey look we&#39;re going to bring ten
people together right now and have a
meeting I don&#39;t care what you&#39;re doing
just you&#39;ve got to stop doing what
you&#39;re doing so you can have this
meeting they what are the chances that
all ten people are ready to stop what if
they&#39;re thinking about something
important or if they&#39;re doing important
work all of a sudden you&#39;re be telling
them they have to stop doing that to do
something else so they go into a meeting
room they get together and they talk
about stuff that doesn&#39;t really matter
usually because meetings aren&#39;t work
meetings are places to go talk about
things you&#39;re supposed to be doing later
but meetings also procreate so one
meeting tends to lead to another meeting
intensively to another meeting there&#39;s
often too many people in the meetings
and they&#39;re very very expensive to the
organization companies often think of a
one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting
but that&#39;s not true unless there&#39;s only
one person in that meeting there are ten
people in the meeting it&#39;s a 10 hour
meeting it&#39;s not a one-hour meeting it&#39;s
10 hours of productivity taken from the
rusty organization to have this one
one-hour meeting which probably should
have been handled by two or three people
talking for a few minutes but instead
there&#39;s a long scheduled meeting because
meetings are scheduled the way software
works
is in like increments of 15 minutes or
30 minutes or an hour you don&#39;t schedule
an eight-hour meeting with Outlook you
can&#39;t I don&#39;t know if you can you go 15
minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or
an hour and so we tend to fill these
times up when things should really go
really quickly so meetings and managers
are two major problems in businesses
today especially in offices these things
don&#39;t exist outside of the office so I
have some suggestions to kind of remedy
the situation
what can managers do enlightened
managers hopefully what can they do to
make the office a better place for
people to work so it&#39;s not the last
resort but it&#39;s the first resort it&#39;s
that people start to say when I really
want to get stuff done I go to the
office because the offices are well
equipped everything should be there for
them to do their work but they don&#39;t
want to go there right now so how do we
change that I have three suggestions
I&#39;ll share with you guys about three
minutes so that that will fit perfectly
we&#39;ve all heard of like you know the the
the casual Friday thing I don&#39;t know if
people still do that but how about no
talk Thursdays how about pick one third
just one Thursday once a month and cut
that day in half and just say the
afternoon I&#39;ll make it really easy for
you so just the afternoon one Thursday
the first Thursday of the month just the
afternoon nobody in the office can talk
to each other just silence that&#39;s it and
what you&#39;ll find is that a tremendous
amount of work actually gets done when
no one talks to each other this is when
people actually get stuff done is when
no one&#39;s bothering them when no one&#39;s
interrupting them and you can give
someone like giving someone four hours
of uninterrupted time is the best gift
you can give anybody at work it&#39;s better
than a computer it&#39;s better than a new
monitor it&#39;s better than new software or
whatever people typically use give you
them four hours of quiet time at the
office is going to be incredibly
valuable and if you try that I think
you&#39;ll find that you agree and maybe
hopefully you can do it more often so
maybe it&#39;s every other week or every
week once a week
afternoons don&#39;t look and talk to each
other that&#39;s something that you&#39;ll find
will really really work another thing
you can try is switching from active
communication and collaboration which is
like face-to-face stuff tapping people
on the shoulder saying hi to them having
meetings and replace that with more
passive models of communication using
things like email instant messaging or
collaboration products things
that now some people might say emails
really distracting and Iams really
distracting and these other things are
really distracting but they&#39;re
distracting at a time of your own choice
and your own choosing you can quit the
email app you can&#39;t quit your boss you
can quit I am you can&#39;t hide your
manager right you can put these things
away and then you can be interrupted on
your own schedule at your own time when
you&#39;re available when you&#39;re ready to go
again because work like sleep happens in
phases so you&#39;re going to be kind of
going up and doing some work and you&#39;re
going to come down from that work and
then maybe it&#39;s time to check that email
check that I am and there are very very
few things that are that urgent that
need to happen need to be answered right
this second so if you&#39;re a manager start
encouraging people to use more things
like I am and email and other things
that someone else can put away and then
get back to you on their own schedule
and the last suggestion I have is that
if you do have a meeting coming up if
you are if you have the power just
cancel it just cancel that next meeting
with the today&#39;s Friday so Monday
usually people have meetings on Monday
just don&#39;t have it now I don&#39;t mean like
move it I mean just erase it from memory
it&#39;s gone and you&#39;ll find out that
everything will be just fine like all
these discussions and decisions you
thought you had to make at this one time

at 9:00 a.m. on Monday just forget about
them and things will be just fine people
have a more open morning they can
actually think and you&#39;ll find out that
maybe all these things you thought you
had to do you don&#39;t actually have to do
so those are just three quick
suggestions I want to give you guys to
think about this and I hope that some of
these ideas were at least provocative
enough for managers and bosses and
business owners and organizers and and
people who are in charge of other people
to think about laying off a little bit
and giving people some more time to get
some work done and I think it&#39;ll all pay
off in the end so thanks for listening
you
