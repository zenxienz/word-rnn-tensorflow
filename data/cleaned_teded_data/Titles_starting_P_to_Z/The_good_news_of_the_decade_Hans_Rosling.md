we are here today because United Nations
have defined goals for the progress of
countries they&#39;re called Millennium
Development Goals and the reason I
really like these goals is that there
are eight of them and by specifying
eight different goals the United Nations
have said that there are so many things
needed to change in a country in order
to get a good life for people look here
you have to end poverty education gender
child and maternal health control
infections protect the environment and
get the good global links between
nations in every aspects from aid to
trade there&#39;s a second reason I like
these Development Goals and that is
because each and every one is measured
take child mortality the aim here is to
reduce child mortality with two thirds
from 1990 to 2000 and 50s that&#39;s a 4%
reduction per year and and and this with
measuring that&#39;s what make the
difference between political talking
like this and really going for the
important thing a better life for people
and what I&#39;m so happy about with this is
that we have already documented that
there are many countries in Asia in
Middle East in Latin America and East
Europe that is reducing with this rate
and even mighty Brazil is going down
with five percent per year and Turkey
with seven percent per year so there&#39;s
good news but then I hear people saying
there is no progress in Africa and
there&#39;s not even statistics in Africa to
know what is happening I&#39;ll prove them
wrong on both parts count with me to the
wonderful world of statistic I bring you
to the webpage child mortality dot or
you know where you can dag deaths in
children below five years of age for all
countries it&#39;s done by UN specialists
you know and I will take Kenya&#39;s an
example here you see the data don&#39;t
panic now don&#39;t panic you know I&#39;ll help
you through this it looks you know nasty
like in in college when you did like
statistics man but
but first thing when you see dots like
this you have to ask yourself from where
do the data come what is the origin of
the data is it so that in Kenya there
are doctors and other specialists who
write the death certificate at the death
of the child and it&#39;s sent to the
Statistical Office no low-income
countries like Kenya still don&#39;t have
that level of organization it exists but
it&#39;s not complete because so many deaths
occur in the home with the family and
it&#39;s not registered so what we rely on
is not incomplete system we have
interviews we have surveys and it is
highly professional female interviewers
who sit down for one hour with a woman
and Oscar about birth history how many
children did you have order your life if
they died at what age and what year and
then this is done in a representative
sample of thousands of women in the
country and put together in what used to
be called a demographic Health Survey
report but these surveys are costly so
they can only be done with three to five
years interval but they have good
quality so this is this is limitation
and all these colored lines here are
results each color is one serving but
that&#39;s too complicated for today so I&#39;d
simplified for you and I give you one
average point for each survey this was
1977 1988 1992 97 and 2002 and when when
the expert in the UN have got these
service in place in their database then
they use advanced mathematical formulas
to produce a trend line and trend line
and the trend line looks like this see
here is the best fit they can get at
this point but watch out they continue
the line beyond the last point out into
nothing and they estimated that 2008
Kenya had a child mortality of 128 and I
was sad because we could see this this
reversal in Kenya with an increased
child mortality in the 90s it was so
tragic but in June I got to mail in my
inbox from demographic Health Survey and
it showed
news from Kenya I was so happy this was
the estimate of the new survey then it
just took another three months for you
and to get it into their server and on
Friday we got the new trend line it was
down here is it did not
isn&#39;t it nice yeah I was actually on
Friday sitting in front of my computer
and I saw that the death rate fall from
128 to 84 yes that morning you know so
we celebrated but now when you have this
trend line how do we measure progress
I&#39;m going into some details here because
you can do it like this they start 1992
the measure to 2009 they say 0.9% no
progress that&#39;s unfair as a professor I
think I have the right to propose
something differently I would say at
least do this ten years is enough to
follow the trend it&#39;s to two surveys and
you can see what&#39;s happening now they
have 2.4% had I been in the Ministry of
Health in Kenya I may have joined these
two punch so what I&#39;m telling you is
that we know the child mortality we have
a decent temp it coming into some tricky
things then when we are measuring MDGs
and the reason here for Africa is
especially important because 90s was a
bad decade not only in Kenya but across
Africa the HIV epidemic peak that was
resistant for the old malaria drugs
until we got the new drugs we got later
the mosquito netting and there were
socio-economic problems which are now
being solved at the much better scale so
look at the average here this is the
average for all of sub-saharan Africa
and UN says it&#39;s a reduction with 1.8%
now this sounds a little theoretical but
it&#39;s not so theoretically you know these
economists they love money they want
more and more of it they want it to grow
so they calculate the percent annual
growth rate of economy we in public
health we hate child debt
so we want less and less and less of
child deaths so we recalculate the
percent reduction per year but it&#39;s sort
of the same percentage if your economy
grow with 4% you ought to reduce child
mortality with 4% if it&#39;s used well and
people are really involved and can get
the use of the resources in the way they
want so so is this fair now to measure
this over 19 years and
economists would never do that I have
just divided into two period in the 90s
only 1.2 percent only 1.2 percent
whereas now second gear is like Africa
had first gear
now they go into second gear but even
this is not a fair representation of
Africa because it&#39;s an average it&#39;s an
average speed of reduction in Africa and
look here when I take you into my bubble
graphs
still here child F per 1000 on that axis
here we have year and I&#39;m now giving you
a wider picture than the MDG I start 50
years ago when Africa celebrated
independence in most countries I give
you Congo which was high gone are lower
and Kenya even lower and what has
happened over the year since there here
we go
you can see with independence literacy
improved you know and vaccination
started smallpox was eradicated hygiene
was improved and things got better but
then in the eighties watch out here
congra got into civil war and they
leveled off here Ghana got very helpful
this was the backlash in Kenya and go on
a bypass but then Kenyan gonna go down
together
still the standstill in Hong Kong that&#39;s
why we are today you can see it doesn&#39;t
make sense to make an average of this
serie improvement and this very fast
improvement time has come to stop
thinking about sub-saharan Africa as one
place that their countries are so
different and they married to be
recognized in the same way as we don&#39;t
talk about Europe as one place I can
tell you that the economy in Greece and
Sweden are very different everyone knows
that and they are judged each country on
how they are doing you know so so let me
show the why the picture my country
Sweden 1800 we were up there what the
strange personality disorder we must
have counting the children so
meticulously in spite of a high child
death rate it&#39;s very strange it&#39;s sort
of embarrassing but we had that habit in
Sweden you know that we counted all the
child that&#39;s even if we didn&#39;t do
anything about it
and then you see these are feminine
years this was bad years and people got
fed up with reading my own sisters moved
to the United States you know and
eventually soon they started to get
better and better here and here we got
better education and we got health
service and and child mortality came
though we never had the war Sweden was
in peace all this time
but look the rate of lowering in Sweden
was not fast Sweden achieved a low child
mortality because we started early
we had primary school actually starting
1842 and then you get that wonderful
effect when we got female literacy one
generation later you have to realize
that the investments we do in progress
or long-term investment is not about
just five years it&#39;s long term
investments and and and and Sweden never
eat Millennium Development Goal rate 3.1
percent when I calculate so we are off
track that what Sweden is but we don&#39;t
talk about it so much and we want others
to be better than we were and indeed
others have been better let me show you
Thailand see what the success story in
Thailand from the 1960s how they went
down here and reached almost the same
child mortality levels of Sweden and
I&#39;ll give you another story Egypt the
most hint and glorious success in public
health he just was up here 1960 higher
than Congo the Nile Delta was a misery
for children with diarrheal disease you
know and and malaria and a lot of
problem and then they got the Aswan Dam
they got electricity in the homes they
increased education they got primary
health care and down they went you know
and they got safer water they eradicated
malaria and isn&#39;t it a success story
Millennium Development Goal rates for
child mortality is fully possible and
the good thing is that Ghana today is
going with the same rate as Egypt it as
it fastest you know Kenya is now
speeding up here we have a problem we
have a severe problem in countries which
are at a standstill
now let me now bring you to a wider
picture a wider picture of child
mortality I&#39;m going to show you the
relation between child mortality on this
axis here the
axis here is child mortality and here I
have the family size the relation
between child mortality and family size
1 2 3 4 children per woman six seven
eight children per woman this is once
again 1960 50 years ago each bubble is a
country the color you can see the
continent the dark blue here is
sub-saharan Africa you know and the size
of the bubble is the population and
these are the so-called developing
countries they had high or very high
child mortality and family size six to
eight and and and the ones over there
they were the so called Western
countries they had low child mortality
and small families what has happened
what I want you now is to see with your
own eyes the relation between falling
child mortality and decreasing family
size I just want not have any has to see
that for yourself this is what happened
now I start the world here we come down
with their educational smallpox better
education you know health service it got
on the air China comes Indian to the
Western box here you know and here
Brazil is in the West of all India&#39;s
approach&#39; the first African country is
coming into the Western ball and we get
a lot of new neighbors welcome to a
decent life come on we want everyone
down here this is the vision we have
isn&#39;t it and look now the African the
first African countries here are coming
in there we are today there is no such
thing as a Western world and developing
world this is the this is the report
from UN which came out on Friday it&#39;s
very good levels and trends in child
mortality except this time this cake is
very bad it&#39;s the categorization of
countries it labels developing countries
I can read from the listed developing
countries Republic of Korea South Korea
now they get some zoom how can they be
developing countries they have here
Singapore that the lowest child
mortality in the world is Singapore they
bypass Swede and five years ago and they
are labeled developing country they have
here guitar it&#39;s a richest country in
the world without Jazeera how the heck
could they be developing country this is
prep the rest here is good the rest is
good we have to have a modern concept
which fit to the data you know and we
have to realize that we are all going to
live into this down to here what is the
importance now with the relations here
look even if we look in Africa these are
the African countries you can clearly
see the relation with falling child
mortality and decreasing family size
even within Africa it&#39;s very clear that
this is what happens and a very
important piece of research came out on
Friday from the Institute of Health
metrics and evaluation in Seattle
showing that almost 50 percent of the
fall in child mortality can be
attributed to female education that is
when we got get girls in school we will
get an impact 15 to 20 years later which
is a secular trend which is very strong
that&#39;s why we must have that long-term
perspective but we must measure the
impact over ten years period it&#39;s fully
possible to get child mortality down in
all of these countries and to get them
down into the corner why we all would
like to live together and of course
lowering child mortality is a matter or
actor most important from humanitarian
aspects it&#39;s a decent life for children
we are talking about but it is also a
strategic investment in the future of
all mankind because it&#39;s about the
environment we will not be able to
manage the environment and avoid the
terrible climate crisis if we don&#39;t
stabilize the world population let&#39;s be
clear about that
and the way to do that that is to get
child mortality down get access to
family planning and behind that a drive
of female education and that is fully
possible let&#39;s do it thank you very much
you
