in this talk today I want to present a
different idea for why invest in early
child education makes sense as a public
investment it&#39;s a different idea because
usually when people talk about early
childhood programs they talk about all
the wonderful benefits for participants
in terms of in you know forum
participants in preschool they have
better k12 test scores better look
better adult earnings now that&#39;s all
very important but what I want to talk
about is what preschool does for state
economies and for promoting state
economic development and that&#39;s
absolutely crucial because if we&#39;re
going to get increased investment in
early childhood programs we need to
interest state governments in this the
federal government has a lot on its
plate and state governments going to
have to step up so we have to appeal to
them to legislators in the state
government and turn to something
understand that they have to promote the
economic development of their state
economy now by promoting economic
development I don&#39;t mean anything
magical all I mean is is that early
childhood education can bring more and
better jobs to a state and can thereby
promote higher per capita earnings for
the state&#39;s residents now I think it&#39;s
fair to say that when people think about
state and local economic development
they don&#39;t generally think first about
what they&#39;re doing about childcare and
early childhood programs I know this
i&#39;ve spent most my career researching
these programs I&#39;ve talked to a lot of
directors to state economic development
agencies about these issues a lot of
legislators about these issues when
legislators and others think about
economic development what they first of
all think about or business tax
incentives property tax abatements job
creation tax credits you know there are
a million of these programs all over the
place so for example States compete very
vigorously to attract
new auto plants or expanded auto plants
handle all kinds of business tax breaks
now those programs can make sense if
they in fact induce new location
decisions and the way they can make
sense this by creating more and better
jobs they raise employment rates raise
per capita earnings of state residents
so there is a benefit to state residents
that corresponds to the cost that
they&#39;re paying by pay for these business
tax breaks my argument is essentially
that early childhood programs can do
exactly the same thing create more and
better jobs but in a different way it&#39;s
a somewhat more indirect way these
programs can promote more and better
jobs by you build at you and you invest
in high-quality preschool it develops
the skills of your local workforce if
enough of them stick around and in turn
that higher quality local workforce will
be a key driver of creating jobs and
creating higher earnings per cap in the
local community now let me turn some
numbers on this okay if you look at the
research evidence that&#39;s extensive on
how much early childhood programs affect
the educational attainment wages and
skills of former participants in
preschool as adults you take those
knowing effects you take how many of
those folks will be expected to stick
around the state or local economy and
not move out and you take research on
how much skills drive job creation you
will conclude from these three separate
lines of research that for every dollar
invest in early childhood programs the
per capita earnings of state residents
go up by two dollars and seventy-eight
cents so that&#39;s a three-to-one return
now you can get much higher returns of
up to 16 to 1 if you include anti-crime
benefits if you include benefits to
former preschool participants who move
to some other state but there&#39;s a good
reason for focusing on these three
dollars because this is salient and
important to state legislators and state
policymakers and this
states are going to have to act so there
is this key benefit that is relevant to
state policymakers in terms of economic
development now one objection you often
hear or maybe don&#39;t hear it because
people are too polite to say it is why
should I pay more taxes to invest in
other people&#39;s children what&#39;s in it for
me and the trouble with that objection
it reflects a total misunderstanding of
how much local economies involved
everyone being interdependent
specifically the interdependence II here
is is that there are huge spill overs of
skills that when others people&#39;s
children get more Skills that actually
increases the prosperity of everyone
including people whose skills don&#39;t
change so for example numerous research
studies are shown if you look at what
really drives the growth rate of
metropolitan areas it&#39;s not so much low
taxes low cost low wages it&#39;s the skills
of the area particularly the proxy for
skills that people use this percentage
of college graduates in the area so when
you look for example at metropolitan
areas such as the Boston area
Minneapolis st. Paul Silicon Valley
these areas are not doing well
economically because they&#39;re low cost I
know if you ever tried to buy a house in
Silicon Valley is not exactly a low-cost
proposition they are growing because
they have high levels of skills so when
we invest in other people&#39;s children and
build up those skills we increase the
overall job growth of a metro area as
another example if we look at what
determines an individual&#39;s wages and we
do statistical exploration of that what
determines wages we know that
individuals wages will depend in part on
that individuals education for example
whether an
they have a college degree one of the
very interesting facts is that in
addition we find that even once we hold
constant statistically the effect of
your own education the education of
everyone else in your much politan area
also affects your wages so specifically
if you stick in you hold constant your
education you stick in percentage of
college graduates in your metro area you
will find that as a significant positive
effect on your wages without changing
your education at all in fact this
effect is so strong that when someone
gets a college degree the spillover
effects of this on the wages of others
in the metropolitan area are actually
greater than the direct effects so if
someone gets a college degree their
lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount
over seven hundred thousand dollars
there&#39;s an effect on everyone else in
the metro area by of driving up the
percentage college graduates in the
metro area and if you add that up it&#39;s a
small effect for each person but if you
add that up across all the people in the
metro area you actually get that the
increase in wages for everyone else in
the metropolitan area adds up to almost
a million dollars that&#39;s actually
greater than the direct benefits of the
person choosing to get education now
what&#39;s going on here what can explain
these huge spillover effects of
education let&#39;s think about this way I
can be the most skilled person in the
world but if everyone else at my firm
lack skills my employer is going to find
it more difficult to introduce new
technology new production techniques so
as a result my employers going to be
less productive they will not be able to
afford to pay me as good wages even if
everyone at my firm has good skills if
the workers at the suppliers to my firm
do not have good skills my firm is going
to be less competitive competing in
national international markets and again
the firm is less competitive will not be
able to pay as good wages and then
particularly in high-tech businesses in
high-tech businesses they&#39;re constantly
stealing ideas and workers from
other businesses so clearly the
productivity of firms in Silicon Valley
has a lot to do with the skills then
only at the workers at their firm but
the workers at all the other firms in
the metro area so as a result that you
know if we can invest in other people&#39;s
children through preschool and other
early childhood programs that are high
quality we not only help those children
we help everyone in the metropolitan
area gain in wages and we&#39;ll have the
metropolitan area gain and job growth
another objection you sometimes hear to
invest in early childhood programs is
concern about people moving out so I you
know you know maybe Ohio is thinking
about investing in more preschool
education for children in Columbus Ohio
but they&#39;re worried these little
Buckeyes well for some strange reason
beside the moved ann arbor michigan and
become Wolverines and maybe michigan
will be thinking about investing in
preschool in ann arbor michigan and be
worried these little Wolverines will end
up moving ohio on becoming Buckeyes and
so they&#39;ll both under-invest because
everyone&#39;s going to move out well you
know the reality is you look at the data
Americans aren&#39;t as hypermobile as
people sometimes assume the data is that
over sixty percent of americans spend
most of their working careers in the
state they were born in over sixty
percent that percentage does not vary
much from state to state it doesn&#39;t very
much with the state of the state&#39;s
economy whether it&#39;s depressed or
booming it doesn&#39;t very much overtime so
the reality is if you invest in kids
they will stay or at least enough of
them will stay that it will pay off for
your state economy okay so to sum up
there is a lot of research evidence that
early childhood programs if running a
high quality way payoff and higher adult
skills there&#39;s a lot of research
evidence that those folks will stick
around the state economy and there&#39;s a
lot of evidence that having more workers
with higher skills in your local
economy pays off in higher wages and job
growth your local economy and if you
calculate the numbers for each dollar we
get about three dollars back and
benefits for the state economy so in my
opinion the research evidence is
compelling and the logic of this is
compelling so what are the barriers to
getting it done well one obvious barrier
is cost so if you look at what it would
cost if every state government invested
in universal preschool at age for
full-day preschool at age 4 the total
annual national cost would be roughly 30
billion dollars so 30 billion dollars a
lot of money on the other hand if you
reflect on that the US population is
over 300 million we&#39;re talking about an
amount of money that amounts to a
hundred dollars per capita okay a
hundred dollars per capita per person is
something that any state government can
afford to do it&#39;s just a simple matter
of political will to do it and of course
as I mentioned this cost has
corresponding benefits I mentioned
there&#39;s a multiplier of about three 2.78
for the state economy in terms of over
80 billion extra earnings and if we want
to translate that from just billions of
dollars or something that might mean
something what we&#39;re talking about is
that for the average low-income kid that
would increase earnings by about ten
percent over their whole career just
doing the preschool not improving k12 or
anything else after that not doing
anything with calls tuition or access
just directly improving preschool and we
would get five percent higher earnings
for middle-class kids so this is a
investment that pays off in very
concrete terms for a broad range of
income groups in the state&#39;s population
and produces large and tangible benefits
now that&#39;s one barrier I actually think
the more profound barrier is the
long-term nature of the benefits from
early childhood programs so the argument
I&#39;m
a keen as is that we&#39;re increasing the
quality of our local workforce and
thereby increasing economic development
obviously if we have a preschool with
four-year-olds we&#39;re not sending these
kids out of the age 5 to work in the
sweatshops right you know so at least I
hope not so you know we&#39;re talking about
a investment that in terms of impacts in
the state economy is not going to really
pay off for 15 or 20 years and of course
America is notorious for being a short
term or in a society now one response
you can make you this nice someone&#39;s
have done this in talks is people can
talk about there are benefits for these
programs in reducing special adding
remedial education costs there are
benefits parents care about preschool
maybe we&#39;ll get some migration effects
from parents seeking good preschool and
I think those are true but in some sense
they&#39;re missing the point ultimately
this is something we&#39;re investing now
for the future and so what I want to
leave you with is what I think is the
ultimate question I mean I&#39;m an
economist but this is ultimately not a
economic question it&#39;s a moral question
are we willing as Americans or we as a
society still capable of making the
political choice to sacrifice now by
paying more taxes in order to improve
the long-term future of not only our
kids but our community are we still
capable of that as a country and that&#39;s
something that each and every citizen
voter needs to ask themselves is that
something that you are still invested in
that you still believe in the notion of
investment that is the notion of
investment you sacrifice now for return
later so so I think the research
evidence on the benefits of early
childhood programs for the local economy
is extremely strong however the moral
and political choice is still up to us
as citizens
and as voters thank you very much
you
