thank you so much it&#39;s really scary to
be here among the smartest of the smart
I&#39;m here to tell you a few tales of
passion there is a Jewish saying that I
love what is truer than truth answer the
story I&#39;m a storyteller I want to convey
something that is truer than truth about
our common humanity
all stories interest me and some haunt
me until I end up writing them certain
themes keep coming up justice loyalty
violence death political and social
issues freedom I am aware of the mystery
around us so I write about coincidences
premonitions emotions dreams the power
of nature magic in the last 20 years I
have published a few books but I have
lived in anonymity until February of
2006 when I carried the Olympic flag in
the Winter Olympics in Italy that made
me a celebrity now people recognize me
in Macy&#39;s and my grandchildren think
that I&#39;m cool allow me to tell you about
my four minutes of fame one of the
organizers of the Olympic ceremony of
the opening ceremony called me and said
that I had been selected to be one of
the flag bearers I replied that surely
this was a case of mistaken identity
because I&#39;m as far as you can get from
being an athlete actually I wasn&#39;t even
sure that I could go around the stadium
without a walker
I was told that this was no laughing
matter this would be the first time that
only women would carry the Olympic flag
five women representing five continents
and three Olympic gold medal winners my
first question was naturally what was I
going to wear a uniform she said and
asked for my measurements my
measurements I had a vision of myself in
a fluffy anorak looking like the
Michelin Man by the middle of February I
found myself in Turin where enthusiastic
crowds cheered when any of the 80
Olympic teams was in the street those
athletes had sacrificed everything to
compete in the games they all deserve to
win
but there&#39;s the element of luck a speck
of snow an inch of ice the force of the
wind can determine the result of a race
or a game however what matters most more
than training or luck is the heart only
a fearless undetermined heart will get
the gold medal it is all about passion
the streets of Turin were covered with
red posters announcing the slogan of the
Olympics passion lives here isn&#39;t it
always true heart is what drives us and
determines our fate that is what I need
for my characters in my books a
passionate heart
I need Mavericks dissidents adventurers
outsiders and rebels who ask questions
bend the rules and take risks people
like all of you in this room nice people
with common sense
do not make interesting characters they
only make good former spouses
in the green room of the stadium I made
the other flag bearers three athletes
and the actresses Susan Sarandon
and Sophia Loren also two women with
passionate hearts
Wangari Maathai the Nobel Prize winner
from Kenya who has planted 30 million
trees and by doing so she has changed
the soil the weather and in some in some
places in Africa and of course the
economic conditions in many villages and
Somaly Mam a Cambodian activist who
fights passionately against child
prostitution when she was 14 years old
her grandfather sold her to a brothel
she told us of little girls raped by men
who believed that having sex with a very
young virgin will cure them from aids
and of brothels where children are
forced to receive by 15 clients per day
and if they rebel they are tortured with
electricity in the green room I received
my uniform it was not the kind of outfit
that I normally wear but it was far from
the Michelin Man suit that I had
anticipated
not bad really I look like a
refrigerator but so did most of the flag
bearers except Sophia Loren the
universal symbol of beauty and passion
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great
she&#39;s sexy slim and tall with a deep tan
now hunka how can you have a deep tan
and have no wrinkles I don&#39;t know
when asked in a TV interview how could
she look so good she replied posture my
back is always straight and I don&#39;t make
all people&#39;s noises
so there you have some free advice from
one of the most beautiful women on earth
no grunting no coughing no wheezing no
talking to yourselves no farting what
she didn&#39;t say that exactly
at some point around midnight we were
summoned to the wings of the stadium and
the loudspeakers announced the Olympic
Flag and the music started by the way
the same music that starts here they re
damaged Sophia Loren was right in front
of me she&#39;s a foot taller than I am not
counting the poofy hair she walked
elegantly like a giraffe on the African
savannah holding the flag on her
shoulder I jogged behind on my tiptoes
holding my the flag on my extended arm
so that my head was actually under the
damn flag all the cameras were of course
on Sophia that was fortunate for me
because in most press four or I appear
to although often between Sophia&#39;s legs
a place where most men would love to be
the best four minutes of my entire life
were those in the Olympic Stadium my
husband is offended when I say this
although I&#39;ve explained to him that what
we do in private usually takes less than
four minutes so you shouldn&#39;t take it
personally I have all the press
clippings of those four magnificent
minutes because I don&#39;t want to forget
them when old age destroys my brain
cells I want to carry in my heart
forever the key word of the Olympics
passion so here&#39;s a tale of passion the
year is 1998 the place is a prison camp
for Tutsi refugees in Congo by the way
80% of all refugees and displaced people
in the world are women and girls we can
call this place in Congo a death camp
because those who are not killed will
die of disease or starvation the
protagonists of these of this story are
a young woman rose my pendo and her
children she&#39;s pregnant
and a widow soldiers have forced to
watch as her husband was tortured and
killed somehow she manages to keep her
seven children alive and a few months
later she gives birth to premature twins
two tiny little boys she cuts the
umbilical cord with a stick and ties it
with her own hair she names the twins
after the camp&#39;s commanders to gain
their favor and feeds them with black
tea because her milk cannot sustain them
when the soldiers burst in her cell to
rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold
of her and refuses to let go even when
they hold a gun to her head somehow the
family survives for 16 months and then
by extraordinary luck and the passionate
heart of a young American man Sasha shun
off she manages the who manages to put
her in a US rescue plane Rose my pendo
and her nine children end up in Phoenix
Arizona where they are now living and
thriving
my pendo in Saheed Swahili means great
love the protagonists of my books are
strong and passionate women like Rose my
pendo I don&#39;t make them up there&#39;s no
need for that I look around and I see
them everywhere I have worked with women
and for women all my life I know them
well I was born in ancient times at the
end of the world
they patriarchal Catholic and
conservative family no wonder that by
age 5 I was a raging feminist although
the term had not reached Sheila yet so
nobody knew what the heck was wrong with
me I would soon find out that there was
a high price to pay for my freedom and
for questioning the patriarchy but I was
happy to pay it because for every blow
that I received I was able to deliver to
once when my daughter Paola was in her
20s she said to me that feminism was
dated that I should move on we had a
memorable fight feminism is dated yes
for privileged women like my daughter
and all of us here today but not for
most of our sisters in the rest of the
world who are still forced into
premature marriage prostitution forced
labor they have children that they don&#39;t
want or they cannot feed they have no
control over their bodies or their lives
they have no education and no freedom
they are raped beaten up and sometimes
killed with impunity for most Western
young women of today being called the
feminists is an insult feminism has
never been sexy but let me assure you
that it never stopped me from flirting
and I have seldom suffered from lack of
men
feminism is not dead by no means it has
evolved if you don&#39;t like the term
change it for God&#39;s sake call it
Aphrodite of Venus of bimbo whatever you
want the name doesn&#39;t matter as long as
we understand what it is about and we
support it so here&#39;s another tale of
passion and this is a sad one the place
is a small women&#39;s clinic in a village
in Bangladesh the years 2005 jenny is a
young american dental hygienist who has
gone to the clinic as a volunteer during
her three-week vacation she&#39;s prepared
to clean teeth but when she gets there
she finds out that there are no doctors
no dentists and the clinic is just a hut
full of flies outside there is a line of
women who have waited several hours to
be treated the first patient is in
excruciating pain because she has
several rotten molars jenny realizes
that the only solution is to pull out
the bad teeth she is not licensed for
that she has never done it she risks a
lot and she&#39;s terrified she doesn&#39;t even
have the proper instruments but
fortunately she has brought some
novocaine jenny has a brave and
passionate heart she murmurs a prayer
and she goes ahead with the operation at
the end the relieved patient kisses her
hands that day the hygienist pulls out
many more teeth the next morning when
she comes again to the so called clinic
her first patient is waiting for her
with her husband the woman&#39;s face looks
like a watermelon it is so swollen that
you can&#39;t even see the eyes the husband
furious threatens to kill the American
jenny is horrified at what she has done
but then the translator explains that
the patient&#39;s condition has nothing to
do with the operation the day before her
husband beat her up because she was not
home in time to prepare dinner for him
millions of women live like this today
they are the poorest of the poor
although women do two thirds of the
world&#39;s labor they own less than one
percent of the world&#39;s assets they are
paid less than men for the same work if
they&#39;re paid at all and they remain
vulnerable because they have no economic
independence and they are constantly
threatened by exploitation violence and
abuse it is a fact that giving women
education work the ability to control
their own income inherit and own
property benefits the society
if a woman is empowered her children and
her family will be better off if
families prosper the village prospers
and eventually so does the whole country
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in
Kenya she talks with the women and
explains that the land is barren because
they have cut and sold the trees she
gets the women to plant new trees and
water them drop by drop in a matter of
five or six years they have a forest the
soil is enriched and the village is
saved the poorest and most backward
societies are always those that put
women down yet this obvious truth is
ignored by governments and also by
philanthropy for every dollar given to a
women&#39;s program 20 dollars are given to
men&#39;s programs women are 51 percent of
humankind empowering them will change
everything more than technology and
design and entertainment I can promise
you that women working together linked
informed and educated can bring peace
and prosperity to this forsaken planet
in any War today most of the casualties
are civilians mainly women and children
they are collateral damage men run the
world and look at the mess we have what
kind of world do we want this is a
fundamental question that most of us are
asking does it make sense to participate
in the existing World Order we want a
world where life is preserved and the
quality of life is enriched for
everybody not only for the privileged in
January I saw an exhibit of Fernando
Botero Spain tings at the UC Berkeley
library no museum or gallery in the
United States except for the New York
gallery that carries both arrows work
has dared to show the paintings because
the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison
there are huge paintings of torture and
abuse of power in the voluminous Botero
style I have not been able to get those
images out of my mind or my heart what I
fear most is power with impunity
I fear abuse of power and the power to
abuse in our species the alpha males
define reality and force the rest of the
pack to accept that reality and follow
the rules the rules change all the time
but they always benefit them and in this
case the trickle-down effect which does
not work in economics works perfectly
abuse trickles down from the top of the
ladder to the bottom women and children
especially the poor are at the bottom
even the most destitute of men have
someone they can abuse a woman or a
child I&#39;m fed up with the power that if
you exert over the many through gender
income race and class I think that the
time is right to make fundamental
changes in our civilization but for real
change we need feminine energy in the
management of the world we need a
critical number of women in positions of
power and we need to nurture the
feminine energy in men I&#39;m talking about
men with young minds of course old guys
are hopeless we have to wait for them to
die off
yes I would love to have Sophia Loren&#39;s
long legs and legendary breasts but
given a choice I would rather have the
warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai Somaly
Mam Jenny and Rose my pendo I want to
make this world good not better but to
make it good why not
it is possible look around in this room
all this knowledge energy talent and
technology let&#39;s get off our Fannie&#39;s
roll up our sleeves and get to work
passionately in creating an almost
perfect world thank
what does a machine know about itself
can it know when it needs to be repaired
and when it doesn&#39;t in industries like
manufacturing and energy they&#39;re using
predictive analytics to detect signs of
trouble helping some companies save
millions on maintenance because machines
seek help before they&#39;re broken and
don&#39;t when they&#39;re not that&#39;s what I&#39;m
working on I&#39;m an IBM er let&#39;s build a
smarter planet
