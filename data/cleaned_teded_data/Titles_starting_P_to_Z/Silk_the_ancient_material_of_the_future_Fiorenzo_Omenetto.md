thank you and thrilled thrilled to be
here I&#39;m going to talk about a new old
material that still continues to amaze
us and that my impact the way we think
about material science high-technology
and maybe along the way also do some
stuff for medicine and for global health
and help reforestation so that&#39;s kind of
a bold statement I&#39;ll tell you a little
bit more this material actually has some
traits that make it seem almost too good
to be true it&#39;s sustainable it&#39;s a
sustainable material that is processed
all in water and at room temperature and
it&#39;s biodegradable with a clock so you
can watch it dissolve instantaneously in
a glass of water and have it stable for
years it&#39;s edible its implantable in the
human body without causing any commune
response it actually gets reintegrated
in the body and its technological so it
can do things like micro electronics and
maybe photonics you and the material
look something like this in fact this
this material you see is clear and
transparent this is the components of
this material are just water and protein
so this material is is silk and so it&#39;s
kind of different from what we&#39;re used
to thinking about it&#39;s okay and so the
question is how do you reinvent
something that has been around for five
millennia the process of discovery
generally is inspired by nature and so
we marvel at silkworm the silkworm that
you see here spinning its fiber and the
so current does a remarkable thing uses
these two ingredients protein and water
that are in its gland to make a material
that is exceptionally tough for
protection so comparable to technical
fibers like like Kevlar and so in the
reverse engineering process that we know
about and that we&#39;re familiar with in
for for the textile industry the textile
industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and
then weaves glamorous things we want to
know how you go from water and protein
to this liquid Kevlar and to this
natural Kevlar so or so the inside is is
is how do you actually reverse engineer
this and go from cocoon to gland and get
water and protein that is your starting
material and this is an insight that
came about two decades ago for
from a person that I&#39;m very very
fortunate to work with David Kaplan and
so we get the starting material and so
the starting material is back to the
basic building block and then we use
this to do a variety of things like for
example that films and we take advantage
of something that is very simple the
recipe to make those films is is to take
advantage of the fact that proteins are
extremely smart at what they do they
find their way to self-assemble so the
recipe is simple you take the silk
solution you pour it and you wait for
the protein to self-assemble and then
you detach the protein you get this film
as the proteins find each other as the
water evaporates but I mentioned that
the film is also technological and so
what does that mean it means that that
you can you can interface it with some
of the things that are typical of
technology like like micro electronics
and and nanoscale technology and the
image of the DVD here is just to
illustrate a point that the silk silk
follows very very subtle topographies of
the surface which means that it can
replicate features on the nano scale so
it would be able to replicate the
information that is on that is on the
DVD and we can store information this
film of water and proteins so we tried
something out and we wrote a message and
a piece of silk which is right here and
the message is over there and much like
in the DVD you can read it out optically
and this requires a stable hand so this
is what I decided to do it on stage in
front of a thousand people and so so let
me see so as you see the the film going
transparently through there and then
[Music]
and the most remarkable feat is that my
hand actually stayed still long enough
to do that so once you have once you
have these these these attributes of
this material then you can do you can do
a lot of things it&#39;s actually not
limited to films and so the material can
assume a lot of former so then you kind
of go a little crazy and so you do
various optical components where you do
Micro prism arrays like the ones that
you have you know the reflective tape
that you have on your running shoes or
you can do beautiful things that if if
the camera can capture you can make you
can add a third dimensionality to to the
film and if the angle is right you can
actually see a hologram appear in this
film of silk but you can do other things
you can imagine that maybe you can use a
pure protein to guide light and so we&#39;ve
made optical fibers and and but silk is
versatile and it kind of goes beyond
optics and so you can think of different
formats so for instance if you&#39;re afraid
of going to the doctor and getting slept
with and you know we do micro needle
arrays what you see there on the screen
is a human hair superimposed on the
needles made of silk just to give you a
sense of size you can do bigger things
you can do gears and nuts and bolts that
you can buy at Whole Foods and and the
gears work in water as well so to think
of alternative mechanical parts and
maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if
you need something strong to replace
peripheral veins for example or maybe an
entire bone and so you have here a
little example of a small skull and we
call mini Yorick but you can do things
like cups for example and so if you add
a little bit of gold if you added a
little bit of semiconductors you could
do sensors that stick on the surfaces of
foods you can do electronic pieces that
fold and wrap or you know if your
fashion for some silk LED tattoos
so there&#39;s versatility in as you see in
the material formats that you can that
you can do with that with silk but there
are still some unique traits I mean why
would you want to do all these things
and so for real now you mentioned it
briefly at the beginning the protein is
biodegradable and biocompatible and you
see here a picture of a tissue section
and so what does that mean that it&#39;s the
display degrade on my own
you can implant it in the body without
needing to retrieve what is implanted
which means that all the devices that
you that you&#39;ve seen before and all the
formats in principle can can be
implanted and and disappear and what you
see there in that tissue section in fact
as you see that reflector tape so much
like you&#39;re seen at night by a car then
the ideas that you can see if you
illuminate tissue you can see deeper
parts of tissue because there&#39;s that
reflective tape there that is that a
silk and you see there it gets
reintegrated and tissue and
reintegration in the human body is not
the only thing but reintegration in the
environment is important so you have a
clock you have protein and now a silk
cup like this can be thrown away without
guilt and unlike unlike the polystyrene
cups that that unfortunately fill our
landfills every day it&#39;s edible so you
can do smart packaging around food that
you can cook with the food it doesn&#39;t
taste good so I&#39;m gonna need some help
with that
but probably the most remarkable thing
is that it comes full circle silk during
its self-assembly process it acts like a
cocoon for biological matter and so if
you change the recipe and you add things
when you&#39;re poor so you add things to
your liquid silk solution where these
things are enzymes or antibodies or
vaccines then the the self-assembly
process preserves the biological
function of these dopants so it makes
the materials that environmentally
active and an interactive so that screw
that you thought about beforehand can
actually be used to screw a bone
together fracture bone together and
deliver drugs at the same time while
your bone is healing for example or or
you could put drugs in your wallet and
not in your fridge so we&#39;ve made a silk
card with penicillin in it and we stored
penicillin at sixty degrees C so at 140
degrees Fahrenheit for two months
without loss of efficacy of the
penicillin and so that could be
that could be potentially a good
alternative to solar power refrigerated
camels and and of course there&#39;s no use
in storage if you can&#39;t use and so there
is this other unique material trait that
that these materials have in that they
were programmability degradable and so
and so what you see there is the
difference in the top is you have a film
that has been programmed not to degrade
and in the bottom of film that has been
programmed to degrade in water and what
you see is that the film and the bottom
releases what is inside it so it allows
for the recovery of what we&#39;ve stored
before and so this allows for control
delivery of drugs and for for
reintegration and the environment and
all of these formats that you&#39;ve seen so
the threat of discovery that we have
really is a threat we&#39;re impassionate
with this idea that whatever you want to
do whether you want to replace a vein or
a bone or maybe be more sustainable in
microelectronics perhaps drink a coffee
in a cup and throw it away without guilt
maybe carry your drugs in your pocket
deliver them inside your body or deliver
them across the desert the answer may be
in a thread of silk thank you
