let me tell you it has been a fantastic
month for deception
and I&#39;m not even talking about the
American presidential race we have a
high profile journalist caught for
plagiarism a young superstar writer who
is booking involves so many made-up
quotes that they&#39;ve pulled it from the
shelves a New York Times expose on fake
book reviews it&#39;s been fantastic now of
course not all deception hits the news
much of the deception is every day in
fact a lot of research shows that we all
lie once or twice a day as Dave

suggested so it&#39;s about 6:30 now suggest
that most of us should&#39;ve lied let&#39;s
take a look at Winnipeg how many of you
in the last 24 hours think back have
told a little fib or a big one
how many have told a little lie out
there all right good
these are all the liars make sure you
pay attention to them know that look
there&#39;s about 2/3 of you the other third
didn&#39;t lie or perhaps forgot or you&#39;re
lying to me about your line which is
very very devious
this fits with a lot of the research
which suggests that line is very
pervasive it&#39;s this pervasiveness
combined with the centrality to what it
means to be a human the fact that we can
tell the truth or make something up that
has fascinated people throughout history
here we have Diogenes with his Lantern
does anybody know what he was looking
for a single honest man and he died
without finding one back in Greece and
we have Confucius in the East who is
really concerned with sincerity not only
that you walked the walk or talk the
talk but you believed in what you were
doing you believed in your principles
now my first professional encounter with
deception is a little bit later than
these guys a couple thousand years I was
a customs officer for Canada back in the
mid 90s yeah I was defending Canada&#39;s
borders you may think that&#39;s a weapon
right there
in fact that&#39;s a stamp
I used a stamp to defend Canada&#39;s
borders very Canadian of me I learned a
lot about deception while doing my duty
here in Customs one of which was that
most of what I thought I knew about
deception was wrong and I&#39;ll tell you
about some of that tonight but even
since just 1995-96 the way we
communicate has been completely
transformed we email we text we Skype we
Facebook it&#39;s insane almost every aspect
of human communication has been changed
and of course that&#39;s had an impact on
deception let me tell you a little bit
about a couple of new deceptions we&#39;ve
been tracking and documenting they&#39;re
called the butler the sock puppet and
the Chinese water army it sounds a
little bit like a weird book but
actually they&#39;re all new types of lies
let&#39;s start with the butler&#39;s here&#39;s an
example of one on my way anybody ever
written on my way then you&#39;ve also lied
we&#39;re never on our way we&#39;re thinking
about going on our way here&#39;s another
one sorry I didn&#39;t respond to you
earlier my battery was dead your battery
wasn&#39;t dead you weren&#39;t in a dead zone
you just didn&#39;t want to respond to that
person that time here&#39;s the last when
you&#39;re talking to somebody and you say
oh sorry I got work got to go but really
you&#39;re just bored you want to talk to
somebody else
each of these is about a relationship
and this is a 24/7 connected world once
you get my cell phone number you can
literally be in touch with me 24 hours a
day and so these lies are being used by
people to create a buffer like the
butler used to do between us and the
connections to everybody else but
they&#39;re very special they use ambiguity
that comes from using technology you
don&#39;t know where I am or what I&#39;m doing
or who I&#39;m with and they&#39;re aimed at
protecting the relationships these
aren&#39;t just people being jerks these are
people that are saying look I don&#39;t want
to talk to you now or I didn&#39;t want to
talk to you then but I still care about
you our relationship is still important
now the sock puppet on the other hand is
a totally different animal the sock
puppet isn&#39;t about ambiguity per se it&#39;s
about identity let me give you a very
recent example as in like last week
here&#39;s RJ Ellery bestseller author in
Britain
here&#39;s one of his best-selling books
here&#39;s a reviewer online on Amazon my
favorite by Nicodemus Jones is whatever
else it might do it will touch your soul
and of course you might suspect that
Nicodemus Jones is r.j. Ellery he wrote
very very positive reviews about himself
surprise surprise
now this pucked sock puppet stuff isn&#39;t
actually that new Walt Whitman also did
this back in the day before there was
internet technology sock puppet becomes
interesting when we get to scale which
is the domain of the Chinese water army
Chinese water army refers to thousands
of people in China that are paid small
amounts of money to produce content it
could be reviews it could be propaganda
the government hires these people
companies hire them all over the place
in North America we call this astroturf
II and after surfing is very common now
there&#39;s a lot of concerns about it we
see this especially with product reviews
book we&#39;ve used everything from hotels
to whether that toaster is a good
toaster or not now look at these three
reviews or these three types of
deception I think the Internet is really
making us a deceptive species especially
when you think about the astroturf where
we can see deception brought up to scale
but actually what I&#39;ve been finding is
very different from that now let&#39;s put
aside the online anonymous sex chat
rooms which I&#39;m sure none of you have
been in I can assure you there&#39;s
deception there and let&#39;s put aside the
Nigerian prince who&#39;s emailed you about
getting the 43 million out of the
country let&#39;s forget about that guy too
let&#39;s focus on the conversations between
our friends and our family and our
co-workers and our loved ones those are
the conversations that really matter
what does technology do to deception
with those folks here&#39;s a couple of
studies one of the things one of the
studies we do are called diary studies
in which we ask people to record all of
their conversations all their lives for
seven days and what we can do then is
calculate how many lies took place per
conversation within a medium and the
finding that we get that surprises
people the most is that email is the
most honest of those three media and it
really throws
people for a loop because we think well
there&#39;s no nonverbal cues so why don&#39;t
you lie more the phone
in contrast the most lives again and
again and again we see the phone is the
device that people lie on the most and
perhaps because of the butler lie
ambiguity as I was telling you about
this tends to be very different from
what people expect
what about resumes we did a study in
which we had people apply for a job and
they could apply for a job either with a
traditional paper resume or on LinkedIn
which is a social networking site like
Facebook but for professionals involves
the same information as a resume and
what we found too many people surprised
was it those LinkedIn resumes were more
honest on the things that mattered to
employers like your responsibilities or
your skills your previous job how about
Facebook itself you know we always think
that hey they&#39;re these idealized
versions people are just showing the
best things that happen their lives I
thought that many times my friends no
way they can be that cool and have that
bit of a life well one study tested this
by examining people&#39;s personalities they
had four good friends of a person judge
their personality then they had
strangers many strangers judge the
person&#39;s personality just from Facebook
and what they found was those judgments
of personality were pretty much
identical highly correlated meaning that
Facebook profiles really do reflect our
actual personality all right well what
about online dating I mean that&#39;s a
pretty deceptive space I&#39;m sure you all
have friends that have used online
dating and they would tell you about
that guy that had no hair when he came
or the woman that didn&#39;t look at all
like her photo well we were really
interested in it and so what we did is
we brought people online daters into the
lab and then we measured them we got
their height up against the wall we put
them on a scale got their weight ladies
love that and then we actually got their
drivers license to get their age and
what we found was very very interesting
here&#39;s an example of the men and the
height along the bottom is how tall they
said they were in their profile along
the y-axis the up vertical access is how
tall they actually were that diagonal
line is the truth line if they&#39;re dots
on it they were telling exactly the
truth as you see most of the little dots
are below the line what it means is all
the
as relying about their height in fact
they lied about their height about nine
tenths of an inch what we say in the lab
as strong rounding up you get to five
eight and one-tenth and boom five nine
but what&#39;s really important here is look
at all those dots they are clustering
pretty close to truth what we found was
eighty percent of our participants did
indeed lie on one of those dimensions
but they always lied by a little bit one
of the reasons is pretty simple if you
go to a date a coffee date and you&#39;re
completely different than what you said
game over alright so people lied
frequently but they lied subtly not too
much they were constrained well what
explains all these things what explains
the fact that despite our intuitions
mine included a lot of online
communication technologically mediated
communication is more honest than
face-to-face that really is strange how
do we explain this well to do that one
thing is we can look at the deception
detection literature it&#39;s a very old
literature by now it&#39;s it&#39;s coming up on
50 years it&#39;s been reviewed many times
there&#39;s been thousands of trials
hundreds of studies and there&#39;s some
really compelling findings the first is
we&#39;re really bad at detecting deception
really bad fifty-four percent accuracy
on average when you have to tell
somebody that just said a statement is
lying or not that&#39;s really bad
why is it so bad well it has to do with
Pinocchio&#39;s nose if I were to ask you
guys what do you rely on when you&#39;re
looking at somebody you want to find out
if they&#39;re lying
what cue do you pay attention to most of
you would say that one of the cues you
look at is the eyes the eyes are the
window the soul and you&#39;re not alone
around the world almost every culture
when the top cues is eyes but the
research over the last 50 years says
there&#39;s actually no reliable cue to
deception which blew me away and it&#39;s
one of the hard lessons I learned when I
was a customs officer the eyes do not
tell us whether somebody&#39;s lying or not
some situations yes high stakes maybe
their pupils dilate their pitch goes up
their body movements change a little bit
but not all the time not for everybody
it&#39;s not reliable strange the other
thing is that just because you can&#39;t see
me doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m going to lie
it&#39;s common sense but one important
finding is that we live for a reason we
lie to protect ourselves or for our own
gain or for somebody else&#39;s gain so
there are some pathological liars but
they make up a tiny portion of the of
the population we lie for a reason just
because people can&#39;t see us doesn&#39;t mean
we&#39;re going to necessarily lie but I
think there&#39;s actually something much
more interesting and fundamental going
on here the next big thing for me the
next big idea we can find by going way
back in history to the origins of
language most linguists agree that we
started speaking somewhere between fifty
thousand a hundred thousand years ago
that&#39;s a long time ago a lot of humans
have lived since then we&#39;ve been talking
I guess about fires and caves and
saber-toothed Tigers I don&#39;t know what
they talked about but they were doing a
lot of talking and that get said there&#39;s
a lot of humans evolving speaking about
a hundred billion people in fact what&#39;s
important though is that writing only
emerged about 5000 years ago so what
that means is that all the people before
there was any writing every word that
they ever said every utterance
disappeared no trace evanescent gone so
we&#39;ve been evolving to talk in a way in
which there is no record in fact even
the next big change to writing was only
500 years ago now with the printing
press which is very recent our past and
literacy rates remained incredibly low
right up until World War two so even the
people of the last two millennia most of
the words they ever said disappeared
let&#39;s turn to now the networked age how
many of you have recorded something
today anybody do any writing today did
anybody write a word it looks like
almost every single person here recorded
something in this room right now we&#39;ve
probably recorded more than almost all
of human pre ancient history that is
crazy we&#39;re entering this amazing period
of flux in human evolution where we&#39;ve
evolved to speak in a way in which our
words disappear but we&#39;re in an
environment
where we&#39;re recording everything in fact
I think in the very near future it&#39;s not
just what we write that will be recorded
everything we do will be recorded what
does that mean what&#39;s the next big idea
from that well as a social scientist
this is the most amazing thing I have
ever even dreamed of now I can look at
all those words that used to for
millennia disappear I can look at lies
that before we&#39;re said and then gone
remember those astroturfing
reviews that we were talking about
before well when they write a fake
review they have to post it somewhere
and it&#39;s left behind for us so one thing
that we did I&#39;ll give you an example of
looking at the language is we paid
people to write some fake reviews one of
these reviews is fake the person never
was at the James hotel the other review
is real the person stayed there now your
task now is to decide which review is
fake I&#39;ll give you a moment to read
through them but I want everybody to
raise their hand at some point remember
I study deception I can tell if you
don&#39;t raise your hand all right how many
of you believe that a is the fake all
right very good about half and how many
of you think that B is all right
slightly more for B excellent
here&#39;s the answer B is a fake well done
second group you dominated the first
group you&#39;re actually a little bit
unusual every time we demonstrate this
it&#39;s usually about a 50/50 split which
fits with the research 54% maybe people
here in Winnipeg are more suspicious and
better at figuring it out there&#39;s cold
hard winters I love it all right so why
do I care about this well what I can do
now with my colleagues in computer
science is we can create computer
algorithms that can analyze the
linguistic traces of deception let me
highlight a couple of things here in the
fake review the first is that Liars tend
to think about narrative they make up a
story who and and what happened and
that&#39;s what happened here our fake
reviewers talked about who they
with and what they were doing they also
used the first person singular I weigh
more than the people to actually stay
there they were inserting themselves
into the hotel review kind of trying to
convince you were there
in contrast the people that wrote the
reviews that were actually there
their bodies were actually entered the
physical space they talked a lot more
about spatial information they said how
big the bathroom was or they said you
know here&#39;s how far shopping is from the
hotel now you guys did pretty well most
people perform a chance of this task our
computer algorithm is very accurate much
more accurate than then humans can be
and it&#39;s not going to be acted all the
time this isn&#39;t a deception detection
machine to tell if your girlfriend&#39;s
lying to you on text messaging we
believe that every lie now every type of
lie
fake hotel reviews fake shoe reviews
your girlfriend cheating on you with
text messaging those are all different
lies they&#39;re gonna have different
patterns of language but because
everything is recorded now we can look
at all of those kinds of lines now as I
said as a social scientist this is
wonderful it&#39;s transformational we&#39;re
going to be able to learn so much more
about human thought and expression about
everything from love to attitudes
because everything is being recorded now
but what does it mean for the average
citizen what does it mean for us in our
lives
let&#39;s forget deception for a bit one of
the big ideas I believe is that we&#39;re
leaving these huge traces behind my
inbox and outbox for email is massive
and I never look at it I write all the
time but I never look at my at my record
at my trace and I think we&#39;re going to
see a lot more of that where we can
reflect on who we are by looking at what
we wrote what we said what we did now if
we bring it back the deception there&#39;s a
couple to take away things here first
line online can be very dangerous
right not only are you leaving a record
for yourself on your machine but you&#39;re
leaving a record on the person that that
you were lying to and you&#39;re also
leaving them around for me to analyze
with some computer algorithms so by all
means go ahead and do that that&#39;s good
but when it comes to line and what we
want to do with our lives I think we can
go back to Diogenes and Confucius and
they were less concerned about whether
to lie or not to lie and more concerned
about being true to the self I think
this is really important now when you
are about to say or do something we can
think do I want this to be part of my
legacy part of my personal record
because in the digital age we live in
now in the networked age we are all
leaving a record thank you so much for
your time and good luck with your record
