I am my writer writing books is my
profession but it&#39;s more than that of
course it is also my great lifelong love
and fascination and I don&#39;t expect that
that&#39;s ever going to change
but that said something kind of peculiar
has happened recently in my life and in
my career which has caused me to have to
sort of recalibrate my whole
relationship with this work and the
peculiar thing is that I recently wrote
this book this memoir called Eat Pray
Love which decidedly unlike any of my
previous books went out in the world for
some reason and became this big mega
sensation international bestseller thing
the result of which is that everywhere I
go now people treat me like I&#39;m doomed
seriously doomed doomed like they come
up to me now like all worried and they
say aren&#39;t you afraid aren&#39;t you afraid
you&#39;re never going to be able to top
that aren&#39;t you afraid you&#39;re going to
keep writing for your whole life and
you&#39;re never again going to create a
book that anybody in the world cares
about at all
ever again so that&#39;s reassuring
you know um but it would be worse except
for that I happen to remember that over
20 years ago when I first started
telling people when I was a teenager
that I wanted to be a writer I was met
with this same kind of sort of
fear-based reaction and people would say
aren&#39;t you afraid you&#39;re never going to
have any success aren&#39;t you afraid the
humiliation of rejection will kill you
aren&#39;t you afraid that you&#39;re going to
work your whole life at this craft and
nothing&#39;s ever going to come of it
you&#39;re going to die on a scrap heap of
broken dreams with your mouth filled
with bitter ash of failure
like that you know and the answer short
answer to all those questions is yes
yes I&#39;m afraid of all those things and I
always have been and I&#39;m afraid of many
many more things besides that you know
people can&#39;t even guess at like seaweed
and and other things that are scary but
when it comes to writing the the thing
that I&#39;ve been sort of thinking about
lately and wondering about lately is why
you know is it rational is it logical
that anybody should be expected to be
afraid of the work that they feel they
were put on this earth to do you know
and what is it specifically about
creative ventures this seems to make us
really nervous about each other&#39;s mental
health in a way that other careers kind
of don&#39;t do you know like my dad for
example was a chemical engineer and I
don&#39;t recall once in his 40 years of
Chemical Engineering anybody asking him
if he was afraid to be a chemical
engineer you know it just didn&#39;t come
like get chemical engineering block John
you know how&#39;s it going and it just
didn&#39;t come up like that you know but to
be fair right chemical engineers as a
group you know haven&#39;t really earned a
reputation over the centuries for being
alcoholic manic-depressives and we
writers you know we kind of do have that
reputation and not not just writers but
creative people across all genres it
seems have this reputation for being
enormous Lee mentally unstable and you
know all you have to do is look at the
very grim death count in the twentieth
century alone of really magnificent
creative minds who died young and often
at their own hands you know and even the
ones who didn&#39;t literally commit suicide
seemed to be really undone by their
gifts you know Norman Mailer just before
he died last interview he said every one
of my books has killed me a little more
an extraordinary statement to make about
your life&#39;s work you know but we don&#39;t
even blink when we hear somebody say
this because we&#39;ve heard that kind of
stuff for so long and somehow we&#39;ve
completely internalized and accepted
collectively this notion that creativity
and suffering are somehow inherently
linked and that artistry in the end will
always ultimate
we lead to anguish and the question that
I want to ask everybody here today is
are you guys all cool with that idea
like are you comfortable with that
because you look at it even from an inch
away and you know I&#39;m not at all
comfortable with that assumption I think
it&#39;s odious and I also think it&#39;s
dangerous and I don&#39;t want to see it
perpetuated into the next century I
think better if we encourage you know
our great creative minds to live you
know and and I definitely know that in
in my case in my situation it would be
very dangerous for me to start sort of
leaking down that dark path of
assumption you know particularly given
the circumstance that I&#39;m in right now
in my career which is you know like
check it out I&#39;m pretty young I&#39;m only
about 40 years old I still have maybe
another four decades of work left in me
and it&#39;s exceedingly likely that
anything I write from this point forward
is going to be judged by the world as
the work that came after the freakish
success of my last book right I should
just put it bluntly because we&#39;re all
sort of friends here now it&#39;s
exceedingly likely that my greatest
success is behind me you know I&#39;m so
Jesus what a thought you know like
that&#39;s the kind of thought that could
lead a person to start drinking gin at

9:00 o&#39;clock in the morning and you know
I don&#39;t want to go there you know I
would prefer to keep doing this work
that I love and so the question becomes
how you know and and so it seems to me
upon a lot of reflection that that the
way that I have to work now in order to
continue writing is that I have to
create some sort of protective
psychological construct right I have to
sort of find some way to have a safe
distance you know between me as I am
writing and my very natural anxiety
about what the reaction to that writing
is going to be from now on and and as
I&#39;ve been looking over the last year for
like models for how to do that I&#39;ve been
sort of looking across time and I&#39;ve
been trying to find like other societies
to see if they might have had better and
saner ideas than we have about how to
help creative people sort of manage the
inherent emotional risks of creativity
and that search has led me to ancient
Greece and ancient Rome so stay with me
because it does
around back but ancient Greece and
ancient Rome people did not happen to
believe that creativity came from human
beings back then
okay people believed that creativity was
this divine attendant spirit that came
to human beings from some distant and
unknowable source for a distant and
unknowable reasons the Greeks famously
called these divine attendant spirits of
creativity Damons Socrates famously
believed that he had a daemon who spoke
wisdom to him from afar the Romans had
the same idea but they called that sort
of disembodied creative spirit a genius
which is great because the Romans did
not actually think that a genius was a
particularly clever individual they
believed that a genius was the sort of
magical divine entity who was believed
to literally live in the walls of an
artist&#39;s studio kind of like Dobby the
house-elf and who would come out and
sort of invisibly assist the artists
with their work and would shape the
outcome of that work so brilliant there
it is right there that distance that I&#39;m
talking about that psychological
construct to protect you from the
results of your work you know and
everyone knew that this is how it
functioned right so the ancient artist
was protected from certain things like
for example too much narcissism right if
your work was brilliant couldn&#39;t take
all the credit for it everybody knew you
had this like disembodied genius who had
helped you if your work bombed not
entirely your fault you know everyone
knew your genius was kind of lame and
this is how people thought about
creativity in the West for a really long
time and then the Renaissance came and
everything changed and we had this big
idea and the big idea was let&#39;s put the
individual human being at the center of
the universe right above all gods and
mysteries and there&#39;s no more room for
like mystical creatures who take
dictation from the divine and it&#39;s the
beginning of rational humanism and
people started to believe that
creativity came completely from the self
of the individual and for the first time
in history you start to hear people
referring to this or that artist as
being a genius
rather than having a genius and I got to
tell you I think that was a huge error
you know I think that allowing somebody
like one mere person
to believe that he or she is like the
vessel you know like the font and the
essence and the source of all divine
creative unknowable eternal mystery is
just like a smidge too much
responsibility to put on one fragile
human psyche it&#39;s like asking somebody
to swallow the Sun you know it&#39;s just
completely warps and distorts egos and
it creates all these unmanageable
expectations about performance and I
think the pressure of that has been
killing off our artists for the last 500
years and if this is true and I think it
is true the question becomes you know
what now you know can we do this
differently maybe go back to some more
ancient understanding about the
relationship between humans and the
creative mystery maybe not you know like
maybe we can&#39;t just erase 500 years of
rational humanistic thought and
118-minute speech and there&#39;s probably
people in this audience who would raise
like really legitimate scientific
suspicions about the notion of basically
fairies who follow people around like
rubbing fairy juice on their projects
and stuff like I am not probably going
to bring you all along with me on this
but the question that I kind of want to
pose is you know why not why not think
about it this way because it makes as
much sense as anything else I have ever
heard in terms of explaining the utter
maddening capriciousness of the creative
process a process which as anybody who
has ever tried to make something which
is to say as basically everyone here
knows does not always behave rationally
and in fact can sometimes feel downright
paranormal I had this encounter recently
where I met the extraordinary American
poet Ruth Stone who&#39;s now in her 90s but
she&#39;s been a poet her entire life and
she told me that when she was growing up
in rural Virginia she would be out
working in the fields and she said she
would like feel and hear a poem coming
at her from over the landscape and she
said it was like a thunderous Train of
air and it would come barreling down at
her over the landscape and when she felt
it coming because it would like shake
the earth under her feet she knew that
she had only one thing to do at that
point and that was to in her words
like hell and she would like run like
hell to the house and she&#39;d be getting
chased by his poem and the whole deal
was that she had to get to a piece of
paper and a pencil fast enough so that
when it thundered through her she could
collect it and grab it on the page and
other times she wouldn&#39;t be fast enough
so she&#39;d be like running and running and
running and the she wouldn&#39;t get to the
house and the poem would like barrel
through her and she would miss it and
she said it would continue on across the
landscape looking as she put it for
another poet and and then there were
these times this is the piece I never
forgot she said that there were moments
when she would almost miss it right so
she&#39;s like running into the house and
she&#39;s looking for the paper and the poem
passes through her and she grabs a
pencil just as it&#39;s going through her
and then she said it was like she would
reach out with her other hand and she
would catch it she&#39;d catch the poem by
its tail and she would pull it backwards
into her body as she was transcribing on
the page and in these instances the poem
would come up on the page perfect and
intact but backwards from the last word
to the first so when I heard that I was
like that&#39;s
it&#39;s not at all what my creative process
I&#39;m not the pipeline you know like I&#39;m a
mule and the way that I have to work is
that I have to get up at the same time
every day and like sweat and labor and
like barrel through it really awkwardly
but even I in my mule ish Ness even I
have brushed up against that thing you
know at times and I would imagine that a
lot of you have to you know like even I
have had work or ideas come through me
from a source that I honestly cannot
identify and what is that thing and how
are we to relate to it in a way that
will not make us lose our minds but in
fact might actually keep us saying and
for me the best contemporary example
that I have of how to do that is the
musician Tom Waits who I got to
interview several years ago on a
magazine assignment and we were talking
about this and you know you you know Tom
I mean for most of his life he was
pretty much the embodiment of the
tormented contemporary modern artist you
know like trying to control and manage
and dominate these sort of
uncontrollable creative impulses you
know that were totally internalized but
then he got older and he got calmer and
one day he was driving on the freeway in
Los Angeles he told me and this is when
it all changed for him and and he&#39;s like
speeding along and all of a sudden he
hears this little fragment of melody you
know that comes into his head as
inspiration often comes elusive and
tantalizing and he wants it you know
it&#39;s gorgeous and and he longs for it
but he has no way to get it he doesn&#39;t
have a piece of paper he doesn&#39;t have a
pencil he doesn&#39;t have a tape recorder
so he starts to feel all that old
anxiety start to rise in him like I&#39;m
gonna lose this thing you know I&#39;m gonna
be haunted by this song forever and I&#39;m
not good enough and I can&#39;t do it and
instead of panicking he just stopped he
just stopped that whole mental process
and he did something completely novel he
just looked up at the sky and he said
excuse me can you not see that I&#39;m
driving
do I look like I can write down a song
right now you know if you really want to
exist come back at a more opportune
moment when I can take care of you
otherwise go bother somebody else today
go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and
his whole work process changed after
that not the work the work was still
often times as dark as ever you know but
the process and the heavy anxiety around
it was released when he took the Jeannie
the genius out of him where it was
causing nothing but trouble and released
it kind of back where it came from and
realized that this didn&#39;t have to be
this internalized tormented thing it
could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre
collaboration kind of conversation
between Tom and the strange external
thing that was not quite Tom so when I
heard that story it started to shift a
little bit the way that I worked to and
it already saved me once this idea it
saved me when I was in the middle of
writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into
one of those sort of pits of despair
that we all fall into when we&#39;re working
on something and it&#39;s not coming and you
start to think this is going to be a
disaster there&#39;s going to be the worst
book ever written not just bad but the
worst book ever written and and I
started to think I should just dump this
project you know but then I remembered
Tom talking to the open air and I tried
it so I just lifted my face up from the
manuscript and I directed my comments to
an empty corner of the room and I said
aloud
listen you thing you and I both know
that if this book isn&#39;t brilliant that
is not entirely my fault right because
you can see that I am putting everything
I have into this you know I don&#39;t have
any more than this so if you wanted to
be better then you got to show up and do
your part of the deal
okay but if you don&#39;t do that you know
what the hell with it I&#39;m going to keep
writing anyway because that&#39;s my job and
I would please like the record to
reflect today that I showed up for my
part of the job
because in the end it&#39;s like this okay
centuries ago in the deserts of North
Africa people used to gather for these
moonlight dances of sacred dance and
music that would go on for hours and
hours until dawn and they were always
magnificent because the dancers were
professionals and they were terrific
right but every once in a while very
rarely something would happen and one of
these performers would actually become
transcendent and I know you know what
I&#39;m talking about because I know you&#39;ve
all seen at some point in your life a
performance like this you know and it
was like time would stop and the dancer
would step through some kind of portal
and he wasn&#39;t doing anything different
than he had ever done you know a
thousand nights before but everything
would align and all of a sudden he would
no longer appear to be nearly human you
know he would be like lit from within
and lit from below and all like lit up
on fire with divinity and when this
happened
back then people knew it for what it was
you know they called it by its name they
would put their hands together and they
would start to chant allah-allah Allah
God God God that&#39;s God you know curious
historical footnote when the Moors
invaded southern Spain they took this
custom with them and the pronunciation
changed over the centuries from Allah
Allah Allah to allay Olleh Olleh which
you still here in bullfights and in
flamenco dances in Spain when a
performer has done something impossible
and magic Allah Allah Allah Allah
Magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there
it is a glimpse of God which is great
because we need that but the tricky bit
comes the next morning right for the
dancer himself when he wakes up and

discovers that it&#39;s Tuesday 11:00 a.m.
and he&#39;s no longer a glimpse of God he&#39;s
just an aging mortal with really bad
knees and you know maybe he&#39;s never
going to ascend to that height again and
maybe nobody will ever chant God&#39;s name
again as he spins and what is he then to
do with the rest of his life this is
hard this is one of the most painful
reconciliations to make in a creative
life
you know but maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be
quite so full of anguish if you never
happened to believe in the first place
that the most extraordinary aspects of
your being came from you but maybe if
you just believe that they were unload
to you you know from some unimaginable
source for some exquisite portion of
your life to be passed along when you&#39;re
finished with somebody else and you know
if we think about it this way it starts
to change everything you know this is
how I&#39;ve started to think and this is
certainly how I was thinking about it in
the last few months you know as I&#39;ve
been working on the book that will soon
be published as the dangerously
frightening Lee over anticipated
follow-up to my freakish success and and
and what I have to sort of keep telling
myself when I get really psyched out
about that is don&#39;t be afraid don&#39;t be
daunted just do your job
continue to show up for your piece of it
whatever that might be if your job is to
dance do your dance if the divine
cockeyed genius assigned to your case
decides to let some sort of wonderment
be glimpsed for just one moment through
your efforts than Olay and if not do
your dance anyhow and they lay to you
nonetheless I believe this and I feel
like we must teach it Olay to you
nonetheless just for having the sheer
human love and stubbornness to keep
showing up thank you
