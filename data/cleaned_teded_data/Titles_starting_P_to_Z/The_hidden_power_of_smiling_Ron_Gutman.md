when I was a child I always wanted to be
a superhero I wanted to save the world
and then make everyone happy but I knew
that I&#39;d need superpowers to make my
dreams come true so I used to embark on
this imaginary journey to find
intergalactic objects from planet
Krypton which was out of fun but didn&#39;t
yield much result when I grew up and
realized that science fiction was not a
good source for superpowers I decided
instead to embark on a journey of real
science to find a more useful truth I
started my journey in California with a
UC Berkeley 30 year longitudinal study
that examined the photos of student in
an old yearbook and try to measure their
success and well-being throughout their
life by measuring their students smiles
researchers were able to predict how
fulfilling and long-lasting a subject
marriage will be how else you would
score in standardized tests of
well-being and how inspiring she would
be to others in another yearbook I
stumbled upon Barry Obama&#39;s picture when
I first saw his picture I thought that
his superpowers came from his super
color but now I know it was all in his
smile
another aha moment came from a 2010
Wayne State University research project
that looked into pre 1950s baseball
cards of major league players the
researchers found that the span of a
player&#39;s smile could actually predict
the span of his life players who didn&#39;t
smile in their pictures live an average
of only 72 point nine years where
players with beaming smiles lived an
average of almost 80 years the good news
is that we&#39;re actually born smiling
using 3d ultrasound technology we can
now see the developing babies appear to
smile even in the womb when they&#39;re born
babies continue to smile initially
mostly in their sleep and even blind
babies smile to the sound of the human
voice smiling is one of the most basic
biologically uniformed expressions of
all humans
in studies he conducted in Papua New
Guinea Paul Ekman the word most renowned
researcher on facial expression found
that even members of the furry tribe who
were completely disconnected from
Western culture and also known for their
unusual cannibalism rituals attributed
smile to descriptions of situation the
same way you and I would so from Papua
New Guinea to Hollywood on the way to
Modern Art in Beijing we smile often and
you smile to express joy and
satisfaction how many people here in
this room smile more than 20 times per
day raise your hand if you do oh wow
outside of this room more than a third
of us smiled more than 20 times per day
whereas less than 14 percent of us smile
less than five
in fact those with the most amazing
superpowers are actually children who
smile as many as 400 times per day I
think ever wonder why being around
children who smile so frequently make
you smile very often a recent study at
Uppsala University in Sweden found that
it&#39;s very difficult to frown when
looking at someone who smiles you asked
why because smiling is evolutionary
contagious and it suppresses the control
we usually have on our facial muscles
mimicking a smile and experiencing it
physically helped us understand whether
our smile is fake or real so we can
understand the emotional state of the
smiler
in a recent mimicking study at the
University of clermont-ferrand
in France subjects were asked to
determine whether a smile was real or
fake while holding a pencil in their
mouth to repress smiling muscles without
a pencil subjects were excellent judges
but with a pencil in their mouth when
they could not mimic the smile they saw
their judgment was impaired in addition
to theorizing on evolution in the Origin
of Species Charles Darwin also wrote the
facial feedback response theory his
theory states that the act of smiling
itself
actually makes us feel better rather
than smiling being merely a result of
feeling good in his study Darwin
actually started the French neurologist
Julian Bhushan who used electric jolt to
facial muscles to induce and stimulate
swells please don&#39;t try this at home
in a related German study researchers
used fMRI imaging to measure brain
activity before and after injecting
Botox to suppress smiling muscles the
findings supported Darwin&#39;s theory but
by showing that facial feedback modifies
the neural processing of emotional
content in the brain in a way that helps
us feel better when we smile smiling
stimulates our brain reward mechanism in
a way that even chocolate how well
regarded pleasure inducer cannot match
British researchers found that one smile
can generate the same level of brain
stimulation as up to two thousand bars
of chocolate
wait the same study found the smiling is
as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000
pounds turning in cash that&#39;s like 25
grand a smile it&#39;s not bad and think
about this way twenty five thousand
times four hundred quite a few kids out
there feel like Mark Zuckerberg everyday
and unlike lots of chocolate lots of
smiling can actually make you healthier
smiling can help reduce the level of
stress enhancing hormones like cortisol
and adrenaline and dopamine increased
the level of mood enhancing hormones
like endorphin and reduce overall blood
pressure and if that&#39;s not enough
smiling can actually make you look good
in the eyes of others a recent study at
Penn State University found that when
you smile you don&#39;t only appear to be
more likeable and courteous but you
actually appear to be more competent so
whenever you want to look great and
competent reduce your stress or improve
your marriage or feel as if you just had
a whole stack of high-quality chocolate
without incurring the calorie cost as if
you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old
jacket you hadn&#39;t worn for ages or
whenever you want to tap into a
superpower that will help you and
everyone around you live a longer
healthier happier life smile
you
