suppose the two American friends are
traveling together in Italy they go to
see Michelangelo&#39;s David and when they
finally come face to face with the
Statue they both free is dead in their
tracks the first guy will call them Adam
is transfixed by the beauty of the
perfect human form second guy will call
them Bill is transfixed by embarrassment
it&#39;s staring at the thing they&#39;re in the
in the center so here&#39;s my question for
you which one of these two guys was more
likely to voted for George Bush which
for Al Gore I don&#39;t need to show a hands
because we all have the same political
stereotypes we all know that it&#39;s that
it&#39;s Bill and in this case the
stereotype corresponds to a reality it
really is a fact that liberals are much
higher than conservatives on a major
personality trait called openness to
experience people are high on openness
to experience just crave novelty variety
diversity new ideas travel people low on
it like things that are familiar that
are that are safe and dependable if you
know about this trait you can understand
a lot of puzzles about human behavior
you can understand why artists are so
different from accountants you can
actually predict what kinds of books
they like to read what kinds of places
they like to travel to and what kinds of
food they like to eat once you
understand this trait you can understand
why anybody would eat at Applebee&#39;s but
not anybody that you know
this trade also tells us a lot about
politics the the main researcher of this
trait Robert McCrae says that open
individuals have an affinity for liberal
progressive left-wing political views
they like a society which is open and
changing whereas closed individuals
prefer conservative traditional
right-wing views this trade also tells
us a lot about the kinds of groups
people join so here&#39;s the description of
a group I found on the web what kinds of
people would join a global community
welcoming people from every discipline
and culture who seek a deeper
understanding of the world and who hope
to turn that understanding into a better
future for us all this is from some guy
named Ted well let&#39;s see now if open is
predict who becomes liberal and openness
predicts who becomes a tedster then
might we predict that most tedsters are
liberal let&#39;s find out I&#39;m going to ask
you to raise your hand
whether you are liberal left of center
on social issues we&#39;re talking about
primarily or conservative and I&#39;ll give
a third option because I know there
number of libertarians in the audience
so right now please raise your head down
in the simulcast rooms - let&#39;s let
everybody see who&#39;s here please raise
your hand if you would say that you are
liberal or left-of-center please raise
your hand high right now okay please
raise your hand if you&#39;d say you&#39;re
libertarian okay about a two dozen and
please raise your hand if you say you a
right of center or conservative one two
three four five about eight or ten okay
this is a bit of a problem because if
our goal is to understand the world to
seek a deeper understanding of the world
our general lack of moral diversity here
is going to make it harder because when
people all share values when people all
share morals they become a team and once
you engage the psychology of teams it
shuts down open minded thinking we when
the liberal team loses as it did in 2004
and as it almost did in 2000 we comfort
ourselves we try to explain why half of
America voted for the other team we
think they must be blinded by religion
or by simple stupidity
so so if you think if you think that
half of America votes Republican because
they are blinded in this way then my
message to you is that you&#39;re trapped in
a moral matrix and a particular moral
matrix and by the matrix I mean
literally the matrix like the movie The
Matrix but I&#39;m here today to give you a
choice you can either take the blue pill
and stick to your comforting delusions
or you can take the red pill learn some
moral psychology and step outside the
moral matrix now because I know okay I
assume that answers my question I was
going to ask you which one you pick but
no need you&#39;re all high in openness to
experience and besides it looks like it
might even taste good and you&#39;re all a
cure so anyway let&#39;s go with the red
pill let&#39;s take let&#39;s study some moral
psychology and see where it takes us
let&#39;s start at the beginning what is
morality and where does it come from the
worst idea in all of psychology is the
idea that the mind is a blank slate at
birth developmental psychology has shown
that kids come into the world already
knowing so much about the physical and
social worlds and programmed to make it
really easy for them to learn certain
things the hard to learn others the best
definition of an anus I&#39;ve ever seen
this just clarifies so many things for
me it&#39;s from the brain scientist Gary
Marcus he says the initial organization
of the brain does not depend that much
on experience nature provides a first
draft which experience then revises
built in doesn&#39;t mean on malleable it
means organized in advance of experience
ok so what&#39;s on the first draft of the
moral mind to find out my my colleague
Craig Joseph and I read through the
literature on anthropology on cultural
variation and morality and also on
evolutionary psychology looking for
matches what are the sorts of things
that people talk about across
disciplines that you find across
cultures and even across species we
found five five best matches which we
call the founded the five foundations of
morality
the first one is harm care we&#39;re all
mammals here we all have a lot of neural
and hormonal programming that makes us
really bond with others care for others
feel compassion for others especially
the weak and vulnerable gives us very
strong feelings about those who cause
harm this Moeller foundation underlies
about 70% of the moral statements have
heard here at Ted the second foundation
is fairness reciprocity there&#39;s actually
ambiguous evidence as to whether you
find reciprocity another animal
but the evidence for people could not be
clearer this Norman Rockwell painting is
called the golden rule and we heard
about this from Karen Armstrong of
course is the foundation of so many
religions that second foundation
underlies the other 30% of the moral
statements I&#39;ve heard here at Ted third
foundation is in-group loyalty you do
find groups in the animal kingdom you do
find cooperative groups but these groups
are always either very small or they&#39;re
all siblings it&#39;s only among humans that
you find very large groups that people
are able to cooperate join together into
groups but in this case groups that are
united to fight other groups this
probably comes from our long history of
tribal living of tribal psychology and
this tribal psychology is so deeply
pleasurable that even when we don&#39;t have
tribes we&#39;d go ahead and make them
because it&#39;s fun sports is to war as
pornography is to sex we get to exercise
are some ancient ancient drives the the
fourth foundation is authority respect
here you see submissive gestures from
two members are very closely related
species but Authority in humans is is
not so closely based on on power and
brutality as it is in other primates
it&#39;s based on more voluntary deference
and even elements of love at times the
fifth foundation is purity sanctity this
painting is called the allegory of
chastity but purity is not just about
suppressing female sexuality
it&#39;s about any kind of ideology any kind
of idea that tells you that you can
attain virtue by controlling what you do
with your body by controlling what you
put into your body and while the
political right may moralize sex much
more the political left is really doing
a lot of it with food food is becoming
extremely moralized nowadays a lot of it
is ideas about purity about what you&#39;re
willing to touch or put into your body I
believe these are the five best
candidates for what&#39;s written on the
first draft of the moral mind I think
this is what we come with is a
preparedness to learn all of these
things but as my son max grows up in a
liberal college town how is this first
draft going to get revised and how will
it end up being different from a kid
born sixty miles south of us in
Lynchburg Virginia
to think about cultural variation let&#39;s
try a different metaphor if there really
are five systems at work in the mind
five sources of intuitions and emotions
then we can think of the moral mind as
being like one of those audio equalizer
that has five channels where you can set
it to a different setting on every
channel and my colleagues Brian Nozik
and Jesse Graham and I
made a questionnaire which we put up on
the web at www.americanoutback.net
the blue line shows you people&#39;s
responses on the average of all the harm
questions so as you see people care
about harm and care issues they give
high endorsement of these sorts of
statements all across the board but as
you also see liberals care about a
little more than conservatives line
slopes down same story for fairness but
look at the other three lines for
liberals the scores are very low
liberals are basically saying no this is
not morality in-group Authority this
stuff has nothing to do with morality I
reject it but as people get more
conservative the values rise we could
say that liberals have a kind of a two
channel or two foundation morality
conservatives have more of a five
Foundation or five channel morality we
find this in every country we look at
here&#39;s the data for 1,100 Canadians I&#39;ll
just flip through a few other slides the
UK Australia New Zealand Western Europe
Eastern Europe Latin America the Middle
East the East Asia and South Asia notice
also that on all these graphs the slope
is steeper on in-group Authority purity
which shows that within any country the
disagreement isn&#39;t over harm and
fairness everybody I mean we debate over
what&#39;s fair but everybody agrees that
harm and fairness matter moral moral
arguments within cultures are especially
about issues of in-group Authority
purity this effect is so robust that we
find it no matter how we ask the
question in one recent study we asked
people to suppose you&#39;re about to get a
dog you picked a particular breed you
learn some new information about the
breed suppose you learn that this
particular breed is independent minded
relates to its owner as a friends and an
equal well if you&#39;re a liberal you say
hey that&#39;s great because liberals like
to say fetch please
but if you&#39;re conservative that&#39;s not so
attractive if you&#39;re conservative and
you learn that a dog is extremely loyal
to its home and family and doesn&#39;t warm
up quickly to strangers for conservative
well loyalty is good dogs ought to be
loyal but to a liberal it sounds like
this dog is running for the Republican
nomination so you might say okay there
are these differences between liberals
and service but what makes those three
other foundations moral aren&#39;t those
just the foundations of xenophobia and
authoritarianism and Puritanism what
makes them moral the answer I think is
contained in this incredible triptych
from Hieronymus Bosch the Garden of
Earthly Delights in the first panel we
see the moment of creation they all is
ordered all as beautiful all the people
and animals are doing what they&#39;re
supposed to be doing where they&#39;re
supposed to be but then given the way of
the world things change we get every
person doing whatever he wants with
every aperture of every other person in
every other animal some of you might
recognize this as the 60s but the 60s
inevitably gives way to the 70s where
the cuttings of the aperture has heard a
little bit more of course Bosch called
this hell so this this triptych these
three panels portray the timeless truth
that order tends to decay the truth of
social entropy but less do you think
this is just some part of the Christian
imagination where Christians have this
weird problem with pleasure here&#39;s the
same story the same progression told in
a paper that was published in Nature a
few years ago in which Ernst Affair and
Simon&#39;s actor had people play a commons
dilemma game in which you give people
money and then on each round of the game
they can put money into a common pot and
then the experimenter doubles what&#39;s in
there and then it&#39;s all divided among
the player so it&#39;s a really nice analog
for all sorts of environmental issues
where we&#39;re asking people to make the
sacrifice and they themselves don&#39;t
really benefit from their own sacrifice
but you read one everybody else&#39;s
sacrifice but everybody has a temptation
to freeride and what happens is that at
first people start off reasonably
cooperative this is all played
anonymously on the first round
people give about half of the money that
they can but they quickly see you know
what other people aren&#39;t doing so much
so I don&#39;t want to be a sucker
I&#39;m not going to cooperate and so
cooperation quickly decays from
reasonably good down to close to zero
but then and here&#39;s the trick if they
Aaron Kaptur said on the seventh round
they told people you know what new rule
if you want to give some of your own
money to punish people who aren&#39;t
contributing you can do that and as soon
as people heard about the punishment
issue going on cooperation shoots up it
shoots up and it keeps going up there&#39;s
a lot of research showing that to solve
cooperative problems it really helps
it&#39;s not enough to just appeal to
people&#39;s good motives it really helps to
have some sort of punishment even if
it&#39;s just shame or embarrassment or
gossip you need some sort of punishment
to bring people when they&#39;re in large
groups to cooperate there&#39;s even some
recent research suggesting that religion
be priming God making people think about
God often some situations leads to more
cooperative more pro-social behavior
some people think that religion is an
adaptation evolved both by cultural and
biological evolution to make groups to
cohere in part for the purpose of
trusting each other and then being more
effective at competing with other groups
I think that&#39;s probably right although
this is a controversial issue but I&#39;m
particularly interested in religion in
the origin of religion and in what it
does to us and for us because I think
that the greatest wonder in the world is
not the Grand Canyon the Grand Canyon is
really simple it&#39;s just a lot of rock
and then a lot of water and wind and a
lot of time and you get the Grand Canyon
it&#39;s not that complicated this is what&#39;s
really complicated that there were
people living in places like the Grand
Canyon cooperating with each other or on
the savannahs of Africa or on the frozen
shores of Alaska and then some of these
villages grew into the mighty cities of
Babylon and Rome and Tenochtitlan how
did this happen this is an absolute
miracle much harder to explain than the
Grand Canyon the answer I think is that
they used every tool in the toolbox it
took all of our moral psychology to
create these cooperative groups yes you
do need to be concerned about harm you
do need a psychologist Asst but it
really helps to organize a group if you
can have subgroups and if those
subgroups have some internal structure
and if you have some ideology that tells
people to suppress their carnality to
pursue higher nobler ends and now we get
to the crux of the disagreement between
liberals and conservatives because
liberals reject three of these
foundations they say no let&#39;s celebrate
diversity not common in group membership
they say let&#39;s question Authority and
they say keep your laws off my body
liberals have very noble motives for
doing this traditional Authority
traditional morality can be quite
repressive and restrictive to those at
the bottom to women to people who don&#39;t
fit in
so liberal speak for the weak and
oppressed they want change in justice
even at the risk of chaos that this guy
shirt says stop bitching start a
revolution if you&#39;re high an openness to
experience revolution is good it&#39;s
change it&#39;s fun conservatives on the
other hand speak for institutions and
traditions they want order even at some
cost to those at the bottom the great
conservative insight is that orders
really hard to achieve it&#39;s really
precious and it&#39;s really easy to lose so
as Edmund Burke said the restraints on
men as well as their liberties are to be
reckoned among their rights this was
after the chaos of the French Revolution
so once you see this once you see that
liberals and conservatives both have
something to contribute that they form a
balance on unchanged versus stability
then I think the way is open to step
outside the moral matrix this is the
great insight that all the Asian
religions have attained think about yin
and yang yin and yang aren&#39;t enemies yin
and yang don&#39;t hate each other yin and
yang are both necessary like night and
day for the functioning of the world if
I&#39;m the same thing in Hinduism there are
many high gods in Hinduism
two of them are Vishnu the preserver
Shiva the destroyer this image actually
is both of those gods sharing the same
body you have the markings of Vishnu on
the left so we could think of ish nu as
the conservative God you have the
markings of Shiva on the right
Shiva&#39;s liberal God and they work
together you find the same thing in
Buddhism these two stanzas contain I
think the deepest insights that have
ever been attained into moral psychology
from the Zen master sense on if you want
the truth - stand clear before you never
be for or against the struggle between
for and against is the minds worst
disease now unfortunately it&#39;s a disease
that has been caught by many of the
world&#39;s leaders but before you feel
superior to George Bush before you throw
a stone ask yourself do you accept this
do you accept
stepping out of the battle of good and
evil can you be not for or against
anything so what&#39;s the point what should
you do well if you take the greatest
insights from ancient Asian philosophies
and religions and you combine them with
the latest research on moral psychology
I think you come to these conclusions
that are righteous minds were designed
by evolution to unite us into teams to
divide us against other teams and then
to blind us to the truth so what should
you do am I telling you to not strive am
I
telling you to embrace sense on and stop
stop with a struggle for and against no
absolutely not I&#39;m not saying that this
is an amazing group of people who are
doing so much using so much of their
their talent their brilliance their
energy their money to make the world a
better place to fight to fight wrongs to
solve problems but as we learn from
Samantha power in here in her story
about Sergio Vieira de Mayo you can&#39;t
just go charging in saying you&#39;re wrong
and I&#39;m right because as we just heard
everybody thinks they are right a lot of
the problems we have to solve our
problems that requires to change other
people and if you want to change other
people a much better way to do it is to
first understand who we are understand
our moral psychology understand that we
all think we&#39;re right and then step out
even if it&#39;s just for a moment
step out check in with sense on step out
of the moral matrix just try to see it
as a struggle playing out in which
everybody does think they&#39;re right
everybody at least has some reasons even
if you disagree with them everybody has
some reasons for what they&#39;re doing step
out if you do that that&#39;s the essential
move to cultivate moral humility to get
yourself out of this self-righteousness
which is the normal human condition
think about the Dalai Lama think about
the enormous moral authority of the
Dalai Lama and it comes from his moral
humility so I think the point the point
of my talk and I think the point of the
point of Ted is that this is a group
that is passionately engaged in the
pursuit of changing the world for the
better
people here are passionately engaged in
trying to make the world a better place
but there is also a passionate
commitment to the truth so I think that
it the answer is to use that passionate
commitment for to the truth to try to
turn it into a better future for us all
thank you
you
