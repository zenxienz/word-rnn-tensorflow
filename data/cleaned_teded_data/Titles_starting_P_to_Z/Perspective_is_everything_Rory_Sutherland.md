what you have here is an electronic
cigarette it&#39;s something that since it
was invented a year or two ago has given
me untold happiness a little bit of it I
think is the nicotine but there&#39;s
something much bigger than that which is
ever since in the UK they banned smoking
in public places I&#39;ve never enjoyed a
drinks party ever again and the reason I
only worked out just the other day which
is when you go to a drinks party new
stand up and you hold a glass of red
wine and you talked endlessly to people
you don&#39;t actually want to spend all the
time talking it&#39;s really really tiring
sometimes you just want to stand there
silently alone with your thoughts
sometimes you just want to stand in the
corner and stare out of the window now
the problem is when you can&#39;t smoke if
you stand and stare out of the window on
your own you&#39;re an anti-social
friendless idiot
if you stand and stare out of the window
on your own with a cigarette you&#39;re a
 philosopher
so the power of reframing things cannot
be overstated what we have is exactly
the same thing the same activity but one
of them makes you feel great and the
other one with just a small change of
posture makes you feel terrible I think
one of the problems with classical
economics is is absolutely preoccupied
with reality and reality isn&#39;t a
particularly good guide to human
happiness why for example a pensioners
much happier than the young unemployed
both of them after all are in exactly
the same state of life you both have too
much time on your hands and not much
money but pensioners are reportedly very
very happy whereas the unemployed are
extraordinarily unhappy and depressed
the reason I think is that the
pensioners believe they&#39;ve chosen to be
pensioners whereas the young unemployed
feel it&#39;s been thrust upon them in
England the upper middle classes have
actually solved this problem perfectly
because they&#39;ve rebranded unemployment
if you&#39;re an upper middle class English
person you call unemployment a year off
and that&#39;s because having a son who&#39;s
unemployed in Manchester is really quite
embarrassing but having a son who&#39;s
unemployed in Thailand is really viewed
as quite an accomplishment but actually
the power to rebrand things to
understand that actually our experiences
costs things don&#39;t actually much depend
on what they really are but on how we
view them I genuinely think can&#39;t be
overstated there&#39;s an experiment I think
Daniel pink refers to where you put two
dogs in a box and the box has an
electric floor every now and then an
electric shock is applied to the floor
which pains the dogs the only difference
is one of the dogs has a small button in
its half of the box and when it nuzzles
the button the electric shock stops the
other dog doesn&#39;t have the button it&#39;s
exposed to exactly the same level of
pain as the dog in the first box but it
has no control over the circumstances
generally the first dog can be
relatively content the second dog lapses
into complete depression the
circumstances of our lives may actually
matter less to our happiness the sense
of control we feel over our lives it&#39;s
an interesting question we ask the
question the whole debate in the Western
world is about the level of Taxation but
I think there&#39;s another debate to be
asked which is the level of control we
have over our tax money that what cost
us 10 pounds in one context can be a
curse what costs us 10 pounds in a
different context we may actually
welcome it paid 20,000 pounds in tax
towards health and you&#39;re merely feeling
a mug pay 20,000 pounds to endow a
hospital ward and you&#39;re called a
philanthropist I probably the wrong
country to talk about willingness to pay
tax
so uh I&#39;ll give you one in return how
you frame things really matters do you
call it the bailout of Greece or the
bailout of a lot of stupid banks which
lent to Greece because they are actually
the same thing what you call them
actually affects how you react to them
viscerally and morally I think
psychological value is great to be
absurd honest one of my great friends a
professor kann nicht chater who is the
professor of decision sciences in London
believes that we should spend far less
time looking into humanity&#39;s hidden
depths and spend much more time
exploring the hidden shallows I think
that&#39;s true actually I think impressions
have an insane effect on what we think
and what we do but what we don&#39;t have is
a really good model of human psychology
these pre-cana man perhaps we didn&#39;t
have a really good model of human
psychology to put alongside models of
engineering of neoclassical economics so
people who believed in psychological
solutions didn&#39;t have a model we didn&#39;t
have a framework this is what Warren
Buffett&#39;s business partner Charlie
Munger calls a latticework on which to
hang your ideas engineers economists
classical economists all had a very very
robust existing lattice work on which
practically every idea could be hung we
merely had a collection of random
individual insights without an overall
model and what that means is that in
looking at solutions we&#39;ve probably
given too much priority to what I call
technical engineering solutions
newtonian solutions and not nearly
enough to the psychological ones you
know my example of the Eurostar six
million pounds spent to reduce the
journey time between Paris and London by
about 40 minutes for naught point 0 1
percent of this money you could have put
Wi-Fi on the trains which wouldn&#39;t have
reduced the duration of the journey but
would have improved its enjoyment and
its usefulness far more for maybe ten
percent of the money you could have paid
all of the world&#39;s top male and female
supermodels to walk up and down the
Train handing out free Chateau Petrus
to all the passengers you&#39;d still have 5
million pounds in change and people
would ask for the trains to be slowed
down why were we not given the chance to
solve that problem psychologically I
think it&#39;s because there&#39;s an imbalance
in a symmetry in the way we treat
creative emotionally driven
psychological ideas versus the way we
treat rational numerical spreadsheet
driven ideas if you&#39;re a creative person
I think quite rightly you have to share
all your ideas for approval with people
much more rational new you have to go in
and you have to have a cost-benefit
analysis of feasibility study and ROI
study and so forth and I think that&#39;s
probably right but this does not apply
the other way around people who have an
existing framework and economic
framework and engineering framework feel
that actually logic is its own answer
what they don&#39;t say is well the numbers
all seem to add up but before I present
this idea I&#39;ll go and shared some really
crazy people to see if they can come up
with something better and so we
artificially I think prioritize what I&#39;d
call mechanistic ideas / psychological
ideas an example of a great
psychological are there the single best
improvement in passenger satisfaction on
the London Underground per pound spent
came when they didn&#39;t add any extra
trains nor change the frequency of the
trains they put dot matrix display
boards on the platforms because the
nature of a weight is not just dependent
on its numerical quality its duration
but on the level of uncertainty you
experience during that weight waiting
seven minutes for a train with a
countdown clock is less frustrating and
irritating than waiting four minutes
knuckle biting going when&#39;s this train
gonna damn well arrive here&#39;s a
beautiful example of a psychological
solution deployed in career red traffic
lights have a countdown delay it&#39;s
proven to reduce the accident rate in
experiments why because Road range in
patients and general irritation are
massively reduced when you can actually
see the time you have to wait in China
not really understanding the principle
behind this they applied the same
principle to green traffic lights
which isn&#39;t a great idea your 200 yards
away you realize you&#39;ve got five seconds
to go you floor it
the Koreans very assiduously did test
both the accident rate goes down when
you apply this red traffic lights it
goes up when you apply it to green
traffic lights this is all I&#39;m asking
for really in human decision-making is
the consideration of these three things
I&#39;m not asking for the complete primacy
of one over the other I&#39;m merely saying
that when you solve problems usually
look at all three of these equally and
you should seek as far as possible to
find solutions which sit in the sweet
spot in the middle if you actually look
at a great business you&#39;ll nearly always
see all of these three things coming
into play really really successful
businesses Google is a great great
technological success but it&#39;s also a
brick based on a very good psychological
insight people believe something that
only does one thing is better at that
thing than something that does that
thing and something else it&#39;s an innate
thing called gold Aleutian air let
fischbach has written a paper about this
everybody else at the time Google more
or less was trying to be a portal yes
there&#39;s a search function but you also
have weather sports scores bits of news
google understood that if you&#39;re just a
search engine people assume you&#39;re a
very very good search engine all of you
know this actually from when you go in
to buy a television and in the shabbier
end of the row of flat-screen TVs you
can see are these rather despise things
called combined TV and DVD players and
we have no knowledge whatsoever of the
quality of those things but we look at a
combined TV and DVD player and we go
yeah it&#39;s probably a bit of a crap telly
and a bit rubbish as a DVD player so we
walk out of the shops with one of each
Google is as much a psychological
success as it is a technological one I
propose that we can use psychology to
solve problems that we didn&#39;t even
realize with problems at all this is my
suggestion for getting people to finish
their course of antibiotics don&#39;t give
them 24 white pills give them 18 white
pills and six blue ones and tell them to
take the white pills first and then take
the blue ones it&#39;s called chunking the
likelihood that people will get to the
end is much greater when there is a
milestone somewhere in the middle what
are the great mistakes I think of
economics is it fails to understand that
what something is whether it&#39;s
retirement and in
alignment cost is a function not only of
its amount but also its meaning this is
a tell crossing in Britain quite often
queues happen at the tolls sometimes you
get very very severe Hughes you can
apply the same principle actually if you
like to the security lanes in airports
what would happen if you can actually
pay twice as much money to cross the
bridge but go through a lane that&#39;s an
express lane it&#39;s not an unreasonable
thing to do it&#39;s and economically
efficient thing to do time means more to
some people than others if you&#39;re
waiting trying to get to a job interview
you&#39;d patently pay a couple of pounds
more to go through the the fast lane if
you&#39;re on the way to visit your
mother-in-law you&#39;d probably prefer
you&#39;d probably prefer to stay on the
left the only problem is if you
introduce this economically efficient
solution people hate it because they
think you&#39;re deliberately creating
delays at the bridge in order to
maximize your revenue and why on earth
should I pay to subsidize your
incompetents on the other hand change
the frame slightly and create charitable
yield management so the extra money you
go goes not to the bridge company it
goes to charity and the mental
willingness to pay completely changes
you have a relatively economically
efficient solution but one that actually
meets with public approval and even a
small degree of affection rather than
being seen as bastardy so where
economists make the fundamental mistake
is they think that money is money
actually my pain experienced in paying
five pounds is not just proportionate to
the amount but where I think that money
is going and I think understanding that
could revolutionize tax policy it could
revolutionize the public services it
could actually change things quite
significantly here&#39;s a guy you all need
to study he&#39;s not stream school
economist who was first active in the
first half of the 20th century in Vienna
what was interesting about the Austrian
school is they actually grew up
alongside Freud and so they&#39;re
predominantly interested in psychology
they believed that there was a
discipline called proxy ology which is a
prior discipline to the study of
economics proxy ology is the study of
human choice action
and decision making I think they&#39;re
right I think the danger we have in
today&#39;s world is we have the study of
economics considers itself to be a prior
discipline to the study of human
psychology but as Charlie Munger says if
economics isn&#39;t behavioral I don&#39;t know
what the hell is von Mises interestingly
believes economics is just a subset of
psychology I think he&#39;d refers to
economics is the study of human proxy
ology under conditions of scarcity but
von Mises among many other things I
think uses an analogy which is probably
the best justification and explanation
for the value of marketing the value of
perceived value and the fact that we
should actually treat it as being
absolutely equivalent to any other kind
of value we tend all of us even those of
us who work in marketing to think of
value in two ways there&#39;s the real value
which is when you make something in a
factory or provider service and then
it&#39;s a kind of dubious value which you
create by changing the way people look
at things von Mises completely rejected
this distinction and he used this
following analogy he said he referred
actually to some strange economist
called the French physiocrats who
believed that only true value was what
you extracted from the land so if you&#39;re
a shepherd or a quarry man or a farmer
you created true value if however you
bought some wool from the shepherd and
charged the premium for converting it
into a hat you weren&#39;t actually creating
value you were exploiting the shepherd
now for me to say that modern economists
make exactly the same mistake with
regard to advertising and marketing he
says if you run a restaurant there is no
healthy distinction to be made between
the value you create by cooking the food
and the value you create by sweeping the
floor one of them crates perhaps the
primary product the thing we think we&#39;re
paying for the other one creates a
context within which we can enjoy and
appreciate that product and the idea
that one of them should actually have
priority over the other is fundamentally
wrong try this quick thought experiment
imagine a restaurant that serves
michelin-starred food but actually where
the restaurant smells of sewage and
there&#39;s human feces on the floor
the best thing you can do there to
create value is not actually to improve
the food still further it&#39;s to get rid
of the smell and clean up the floor and
it&#39;s vital we understand this if that
seems like a sort of strange abstruse
thing in the UK the post office had a
ninety-eight percent success rate at
delivering first-class mail the next day
they decided this wasn&#39;t good enough and
they wanted to get it up to 99 the
effort to do that almost broke the
organization if at the same time you&#39;ve
gone and ask people what percentage of
first-class mail arrives the next day
the average answer would have been 50 or
the modal answer would have been fifty
to sixty percent now if your perceptions
much worse than your reality what on
earth you doing trying to change the
reality that&#39;s like trying to improve
the food in a restaurant that stinks
what you need to do is first of all tell
people that ninety eight percent of mail
gets there the first step that the next
day first-class mail that&#39;s pretty good
I would argue in Britain there&#39;s a much
better frame of reference which is to
tell people that more first-class mail
arrives the next day in the UK than in
Germany it was generally in Britain if
you want to make us happy about
something just tell us we do it better
than the German
choose your frame of reference and the
perceived value and therefore the actual
value is completely transformed has to
be selection of the Germans that the
Germans of the French are doing a
brilliant job of creating a united
Europe the only thing they didn&#39;t expect
is there uniting Europe through a shared
mild hatred of the French and Germans
but I&#39;m British that&#39;s the way we like
it what you&#39;ll also notice is that in
any case our perception is leaky we
can&#39;t tell the difference between the
quality of the food and the environment
in which we consume it all of you will
have seen this phenomenon if you have
your car washed or valid when you drive
away your car feels as if it drives
better and the reason for this unless my
car Vallot mysteriously is changing the
oil and performing work which i&#39;m not
paying in for and unaware of is because
perception is in any case leaky
analgesics that are branded are more
effective at reducing pain than
analgesics that are not branded I don&#39;t
just mean through a reported pain
reduction actual measured pain reduction
and so perception actually is leaky in
any case so if you do something that&#39;s
perceptually bad in one respect you can
damage the other thank you very much
