imagine a big explosion as you climb
through 3000 feet
imagine a Plane full of smoke imagine an
engine going clock clock clock clock
sounds scary well had a unique seat that
day I was sitting in 1d I was the only
one who could talk to the flight
attendants so I looked at them right
away and they said no problem we
probably hit some birds the pilot had
already turned the plane around and we
weren&#39;t that far you could see Manhattan
two minutes later three things happen at
the same time the pilot lines up the
plane with the Hudson River it&#39;s usually
not the route he turns off the engines
now imagine being on a plane with no
sound and then he says three words as
unemotional three words have I&#39;ve ever
heard he says brace for impact
I didn&#39;t have to talk to the flight
attendant anymore I could see in her
eyes it was terror life was over and I
want to share with you three things I
learn about myself that they I learned
that it all changes in an instant we
have this bucket list we have these
things we want to do in life and I
thought about all the people I wanted to
reach out that I didn&#39;t all the fences I
wanted am in all the experiences I
wanted to had and I never did as I
thought about that later on I came up
with the same which is I collect bat
wines because if the wine is ready and
the person is there I&#39;m opening I no
longer want to postpone anything in life
in that urgency that purpose has really
changed my life the second thing I
learned that day and this is as we clear
the George Washington Bridge which was
by not a lot
I thought about wow I really feel one
real regret I&#39;ve lived a good life in my
own humanity and mistakes I&#39;ve tried to
get better at everything I tried but in
my humanity
I also allow my ego to get in and I
regretted the time I wasted and things
that did not matter with people that
matter I thought about my relationship
with my wife with my friends with people
and after as I reflected on that I
decided to eliminate negative energy
from my life not perfect a lot better
I&#39;ve not had a fight with my wife in two
years it feels great
I no longer trying to be right I choose
to be happy the third thing I learned
and this is as your mental clock starts
going 15 14 13 you can see the water
coming I&#39;m saying please blow up right I
don&#39;t want this thing to break in 20
pieces like you&#39;ve seen in those
documentaries and as we&#39;re coming down I
had a sense of wow dying is not scary
it&#39;s almost like we&#39;ve been preparing
for our whole lives but it was very sad
I didn&#39;t want to go I love my life and
that sadness really framed in one
thought which is I only wish for one
thing I only wish I could see my kids
grow up about a month later I was in a
performance by my daughter first grader
not much artistic talent yet
and I&#39;m balling I&#39;m crying like a little
kid and he made all the sense in the
world to me I realize at that point by
connecting those two dots that the only
thing that matters in my life is being a
great dad
above all above all the only goal I have
in life is to be a good dad I was given
the gift of a miracle of not dying that
day I was given another gift which was
to be able to see into the future and
come back and live differently I
challenge you guys that are flying today
imagine the same thing happens on your
plane and please don&#39;t
but imagine and how would you change
what would you get done that you&#39;re
waiting to get done because you think
you&#39;ll be here forever how would you
change your relationships and the
negative energy in them and more than
anything are you being the best parent
you can thank
you
