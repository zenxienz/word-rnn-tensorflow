Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful
to be on board one of these things.
(Engine roars)
It&#39;s an entirely different perspective.
You&#39;re not looking up at the universe.
You and the Earth are going
through the Universe together.

Fabien Cousteau: I think the oceans
still hold quite a few secrets,
but if we&#39;re to explore
the final frontier on this planet,
we need to live there.
[Journeyed around the world.]

Vincent Moon: I felt the need to travel
and to discover some other music,
to explore the world,
and actually it was also this idea
of nomadic cinema that I had in mind.

Daria van den Bercken: Recently, I flew
over a crowd of thousands of people
in Brazil, playing music
by George Frideric Handel.
I also drove along
the streets of Amsterdam.
I fell in love with the music,
and I wanted to share it
with as many people as possible.

Ben Saunders: It was a journey,
an expedition in Antarctica,
the coldest, windiest, driest,
and highest-altitude continent on Earth.
[And even traveled back in time.]

Allan Adams: Keep looking
further and further,
and then finally you see
a faint, fading afterglow,
and it&#39;s the afterglow of the Big Bang.
[We took bold steps forward.]

Hugh Herr: We the people need not
accept our limitations,
but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.
[Helped medicine get personal.]

Leana Wen: When doctors
are willing to step off our pedestals,
take off our white coats
and show our patients who we are
and what medicine is all about,
that&#39;s when we begin to overcome
the sickness of fear.
That&#39;s when we establish trust.

Manu Prakash: It starts
with a single sheet of paper.
What you see here
is all the possible components
to build a functional, bright-field
and fluorescence microscope.

Jorge Soto: Catching cancer early
is basically the closest thing we have
to a silver-bullet cure against it,
and that is why my team and I
have decided to begin this journey,
to try to make cancer detection
at the early stages
easier, cheaper, smarter,
and more accessible.
[We re-examined power.]

Eric Liu: The problem we face today,
here in America in particular,
but all around the world,
is that far too many people
are profoundly illiterate in power.

Pia Mancini: If Internet
is the new printing press,
then what is democracy
for the Internet era?

Jeremy Heimans: Let&#39;s for a second
talk about what new power isn&#39;t.
New power is not your Facebook page.
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad.
I assure you that his Facebook page
has not embraced
the power of participation.
[Re-defined success.]

Simon Anholt: We don&#39;t admire countries
primarily because they&#39;re rich,
because they&#39;re powerful, successful,
modern, or technologically advanced.
We primarily admire countries
that are good.

Michael Green: GDP is a tool
to help us measure economic performance.
It&#39;s not a measure of our well-being.
[Reckoned with rising inequality.]

Nick Hanauer: No free
and open society can long sustain
this kind of rising economic inequality.
It has never happened.
There are no examples.
You show me a highly unequal society,
and I will show you
a police state or an uprising.

Thomas Piketty: When inequality
gets too extreme,
then it becomes useless for growth.

Charmian Gooch: My wish is for us to know
who owns and controls companies
so that they can no longer be used
anonymously against the public good.
[Wrestled with the power of big data.]

Kenneth Cukier: We have to be the master
of this technology, not its servant.
We are just at the outset
of the big data era.

Jennifer Golbeck:
By liking that Facebook page,
or by sharing this piece
of personal information,
you&#39;ve now improved my ability to predict
whether you&#39;re using drugs
or whether you get along well
in the workplace.

Anne Milgram: I wanted
to introduce data and analytics
and rigorous statistical
analysis into our work.
In short, I wanted
to moneyball criminal justice.
[And debated the right to privacy.]

Glenn Greenwald: The United States
and its partners,
unbeknownst to the entire world,
has converted the Internet
into an unprecedented zone
of mass, indiscriminate surveillance.

Richard Ledgett: This is not NSA
running off and doing its own things.
This is a legitimate activity
of the United States foreign government
that was agreed to by all the branches.

Edward Snowden: We don&#39;t have to give up
our privacy to have good government.

Keren Elazari: I think we need hackers,
and in fact, they just might be
the immune system for the information age.
[We empathized with those who suffer.]

Melissa Fleming: Every day, 32,000 people
will be forcibly displaced
from their homes.

Kimberley Motley:
And what justness means to me,
it&#39;s using laws for their
intended purpose, to protect.

Eman Mohammed: My work is not
meant to hide the scars of war
but to show the full frame
of unseen stories of Gazans.

Sebastian Junger: I&#39;ve been
covering wars for almost 20 years,
and one of the remarkable things
is how many soldiers
find themselves missing it.

Kevin Briggs: In my experience,
it&#39;s not just the talking that you do,
but the listening.
Listen to understand.
[Recognized creativity
as a constant pursuit.]

Sting: Day after day, you face
a blank page and nothing&#39;s coming,
and those days turn to weeks
and weeks to months,
and pretty soon, those months have turned
into years with very little to show.

Mark Ronson: You have to take
an element of those things
and bring something fresh and new to it.

Sarah Lewis: Mastery is about
sacrificing for your craft
and not for the sake
of crafting your career.

Elizabeth Gilbert: The only trick
is that you&#39;ve got to identify
the best, worthiest thing
that you love most,
and then build your house
right on top of it
and don&#39;t budge from it.
[We watched language evolve.]

Jamila Lyiscott:
Let there be no confusion
Let there be no hesitation
This is not a promotion of ignorance
This is a linguistic celebration

Jill Shargaa: Webster&#39;s dictionary
defines the word &quot;awesome&quot;
as fear mingled with
admiration or reverence.
With that in mind,
was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?

Anne Curzan: Multi-slacking
is the act of having
multiple windows up on your screen
so it looks like you&#39;re working when
you&#39;re actually goofing around on the web.

(Laughter)

[We saw the future.]

Nicholas Negroponte: So my prediction is
that we are going to ingest information.
You&#39;re going to swallow
a pill and know English.
You&#39;re going to swallow
a pill and know Shakespeare.
[And most importantly
we saw the best versions of ourselves.]

Dan Gilbert: Human beings
are works in progress
that mistakenly think they&#39;re finished.

Isabel Allende: &quot;Tell me,
what is it that you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?&quot;
Me, I intend to live passionately.

Ziauddin Yousafzai: People ask me,
what special is in my mentorship
which has made Malala so bold
and so courageous and poised.
I tell them, don&#39;t ask me what I did.
Ask me what I did not do.
I did not clip her wings.

Zak Ebrahim: Violence isn&#39;t inherent
in one&#39;s religion or race.
I choose to use my experience
to fight back against terrorism,
against the bigotry.

Mellody Hobson: I think it&#39;s time
for us to be comfortable
with the uncomfortable
conversation about race.
We cannot afford to be color blind.
We have to be color brave.

Geena Rocero: My deepest truth
allowed me to accept who I am. Will you?

Shaka Senghor: So what I&#39;m asking today
is that you envision a world
where men and women
aren&#39;t held hostage to their past,
where misdeeds and mistakes don&#39;t
define you for the rest of your life.

Maysoon Zayid: I gotta tell you,
I got 99 problems and palsy is just one.
If there was an Oppression Olympics,
I would win the gold medal.
I&#39;m Palestinian, Muslim,
I&#39;m female, I&#39;m disabled,
and I live in New Jersey.

(Laughter)
 
(Applause)


Gabby Giffords: Be a leader.
Set an example.
Be passionate.
Be courageous. Be your best.

Andrew Solomon:
Forge meaning, build identity,
and then invite the world
to share your joy.
