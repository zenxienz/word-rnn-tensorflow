For the last five years,
I have documented the lives
of teenage mothers in Latin America.
I started with a series of photographs
about the moment of birth
in my country, Uruguay.

I am the son of a teenage mother
and my sister became
a teenage mother when she was 16.
I began exploring the theme
to better understand
myself and my origins.
In developing countries,
7.3 million girls under the age of 18
give birth each year.
Projections suggest
that the teen pregnancy rate
in Latin America
will be the highest in the world
for the next 80 years.
In Mexico, almost one in two
sexually active adolescents
get pregnant between the ages
of 12 to 19 years old.
Teenage pregnancy
is not just about young pregnancies.
It is about gender violence,
physical, symbolic, psychological
and economic violence.
Girls who become pregnant
before they are 18
rarely achieve an adequate
standard of living.
The pattern of poverty
and limited access
to education and health care
are a common thread
among teen pregnancies.
If a girl in Latin America
gets pregnant before she is 16,
the risk of maternal death
increases fourfold
over a woman in their 20s.
And somehow, in spite of all this,
motherhood also imparts a status
and a respect to the adolescent
in her community.
Her child becomes her life project.
A high percentage of girls
under the age of 18 are single mothers,
as was my mother.
When I was learning to be a parent,
I began to focus on the relationship
between father and child,
a subject rarely given much attention.
I wanted to highlight the ways
in which we need
to educate boys differently
without turning them into macho men.
In some cases, families
send boys to school but not girls.
The persistence of teen pregnancy
heightened the gender equity gap
and the continued existence
of traditional roles.
If we were to allow
equal opportunities to girls,
they could gain independence.
Educating girls is key
to breaking cycles of teen pregnancies.
Girls getting pregnant
between the ages of 10 to 14
are an extremely vulnerable population,
and they can be easy prey
for men twice their age.
There are many cases of violence,
incest and sexual abuse
perpetrated against this group.
This is Gloria.
She became a teen mother at the age of 12,
a result of the ongoing
abuse by her father,
who was also raping Gloria&#39;s two sisters,
ages 8 and 16.
In this portrait,
she has butterflies in her hair,
symbols of resurrection.
For me, it&#39;s extremely important
to portray this mother with dignity.
Pregnancies among girls
younger than 15 is a growing trend,
not only in Latin America,
but many developing
countries in the world.
Our region is marred
by bad social and cultural inequalities,
and teen pregnancy
further increases this divide.
I am committing
to being part of the solution
by making work that implicitly
and emphatically
calls for human rights for girls.
The day life projects
for boys and girls become similar,
teenage pregnancy will decrease.
Thank you.
