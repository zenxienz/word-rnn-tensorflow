Tommy Mizzone: Tonight we&#39;re going to play you two songs.
We&#39;re three brothers from New Jersey,
and the funny thing is that,
believe it or not, we are hooked on bluegrass
and we&#39;re excited to play it for you tonight.
(Music)

(Applause)


TM: Thank you, thank you.

(Applause)


Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
I&#39;m Robbie Mizzone. I&#39;m 13, and I play the fiddle.
This is my brother, Jonny. He&#39;s 10, and he plays the banjo.
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother, Tommy.

(Applause)

We call ourselves the Sleepy Man Banjo Boys.
