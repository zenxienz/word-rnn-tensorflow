A few years ago,
I got one of those spam emails.
And it managed
to get through my spam filter.
I&#39;m not quite sure how,
but it turned up in my inbox,
and it was from a guy
called Solomon Odonkoh.

(Laughter)

I know.

(Laughter)


It went like this:
it said, &quot;Hello James Veitch,
I have an interesting business proposal
I want to share with you, Solomon.&quot;
Now, my hand was kind of hovering
on the delete button, right?
I was looking at my phone.
I thought, I could just delete this.
Or I could do what I think
we&#39;ve all always wanted to do.

(Laughter)

And I said, &quot;Solomon,
Your email intrigues me.&quot;

(Laughter)


(Applause)

And the game was afoot.
He said, &quot;Dear James Veitch,
We shall be shipping Gold to you.&quot;

(Laughter)

&quot;You will earn 10%
of any gold you distributes.&quot;

(Laughter)

So I knew I was dealing
with a professional.

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;How much is it worth?&quot;
He said, &quot;We will start
with smaller quantity,&quot; --
I was like, aww --
and then he said, &quot;of 25 kgs.

(Laughter)

The worth should be about $2.5 million.&quot;
I said, &quot;Solomon, if we&#39;re
going to do it, let&#39;s go big.

(Applause)

I can handle it.
How much gold do you have?&quot;

(Laughter)

He said, &quot;It is not a matter
of how much gold I have,
what matters is
your capability of handling.
We can start with 50 kgs
as trial shipment.&quot;
I said, &quot;50 kgs?
There&#39;s no point doing this at all
unless you&#39;re shipping
at least a metric ton.&quot;

(Laughter)


(Applause)

He said, &quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;I&#39;m a hedge fund
executive bank manager.&quot;

(Laughter)

This isn&#39;t the first time
I&#39;ve shipped bullion, my friend,
no no no.
Then I started to panic.
I was like, &quot;Where are you based?&quot;
I don&#39;t know about you,
but I think if we&#39;re going
via the postal service,
it ought to be signed for.
That&#39;s a lot of gold.&quot;
He said, &quot;It will not be easy
to convince my company
to do larger quantity shipment.&quot;
I said, &quot;Solomon, I&#39;m completely
with you on this one.
I&#39;m putting together a visual for you
to take into the board meeting.
Hold tight.&quot;

(Laughter)

This is what I sent Solomon.

(Laughter)


(Applause)

I don&#39;t know if we have
any statisticians in the house,
but there&#39;s definitely something going on.

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;Solomon, attached to this email
you&#39;ll find a helpful chart.
I&#39;ve had one of my assistants
run the numbers.

(Laughter)

We&#39;re ready for shipping
as much gold as possible.&quot;
There&#39;s always a moment where they try
to tug your heartstrings,
and this was it for Solomon.
He said, &quot;I will be so much happy
if the deal goes well,
because I&#39;m going to get
a very good commission as well.&quot;
And I said, &quot;That&#39;s amazing,
What are you going to spend your cut on?&quot;
And he said, &quot;On RealEstate,
what about you?&quot;
I thought about it for a long time.
And I said, &quot;One word;
Hummus.&quot;

(Laughter)

&quot;It&#39;s going places.

(Laughter)

I was in Sainsbury&#39;s the other day
and there were like
30 different varieties.
Also you can cut up carrots,
and you can dip them.
Have you ever done that, Solomon?&quot;

(Laughter)

He said, &quot;I have to go bed now.&quot;

(Laughter)


(Applause)

&quot;Till morrow.
Have sweet dream.&quot;
I didn&#39;t know what to say!
I said, &quot;Bonsoir
my golden nugget, bonsoir.&quot;

(Laughter)

Guys, you have to understand,
this had been going for, like, weeks,
albeit hitherto the greatest
weeks of my life,
but I had to knock it on the head.
It was getting a bit out of hand.
Friends were saying, &quot;James,
do you want to come for a drink?&quot;
I was like, &quot;I can&#39;t, I&#39;m expecting
an email about some gold.&quot;
So I figured I had
to knock it on the head.
I had to take it
to a ridiculous conclusion.
So I concocted a plan.
I said, &quot;Solomon,
I&#39;m concerned about security.
When we email each other,
we need to use a code.&quot;
And he agreed.

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;Solomon, I spent all night
coming up with this code
we need to use

in all further correspondence:

Lawyer: Gummy Bear.

Bank: Cream Egg.

Legal: Fizzy Cola Bottle.

Claim: Peanut M&amp;Ms.

Documents: Jelly Beans.

Western Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard.&quot;

(Laughter)

I knew these were all words
they use, right?
I said, &quot;Please call me Kitkat
in all further correspondence.&quot;

(Laughter)

I didn&#39;t hear back.
I thought, I&#39;ve gone too far.
I&#39;ve gone too far.
So I had to backpedal a little.
I said, &quot;Solomon, Is the deal still on?
KitKat.&quot;

(Laughter)

Because you have to be consistent.
Then I did get an email back from him.
He said, &quot;The Business is on
and I am trying to blah blah blah ...&quot;
I said, &quot;Dude, you have to use the code!&quot;
What followed is the greatest email
I&#39;ve ever received.

(Laughter)

I&#39;m not joking, this is what
turned up in my inbox.
This was a good day.
&quot;The business is on.
I am trying to raise the balance
for the Gummy Bear --

(Laughter)

so he can submit all the needed
Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans
to the Creme Egg,
for the Peanut M&amp;Ms process to start.

(Laughter)

Send 1,500 pounds
via a Giant Gummy Lizard.&quot;

(Applause)

And that was so much fun, right,

that it got me thinking:
like, what would happen if I just spent
as much time as could
replying to as many
scam emails as I could?
And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing
for three years
on your behalf.

(Laughter)


(Applause)

Crazy stuff happens when you start
replying to scam emails.
It&#39;s really difficult,
and I highly recommend we do it.
I don&#39;t think what I&#39;m doing is mean.
There are a lot of people
who do mean things to scammers.
All I&#39;m doing is wasting their time.
And I think any time
they&#39;re spending with me
is time they&#39;re not spending
scamming vulnerable adults
out of their savings, right?
And if you&#39;re going to do this --
and I highly recommend you do --
get yourself a pseudonymous email address.
Don&#39;t use your own email address.
That&#39;s what I was doing at the start
and it was a nightmare.
I&#39;d wake up in the morning
and have a thousand emails
about penis enlargements,
only one of which
was a legitimate response --

(Laughter)

to a medical question I had.
But I&#39;ll tell you what, though, guys,

I&#39;ll tell you what: any day is a good day,
any day is a good day
if you receive an email

that begins like this:

(Laughter)

&quot;I AM WINNIE MANDELA,
THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA
THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT.&quot;
I was like, oh! -- that Winnie Mandela.

(Laughter)

I know so many.
&quot;I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS
OUT OF THE COUNTRY
BECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND
NELSON MANDELA&#39;S HEALTH CONDITION.&quot;
Let that sink in.
She sent me this, which is hysterical.

(Laughter)

And this.
And this looks fairly legitimate,
this is a letter of authorization.
But to be honest, if there&#39;s nothing
written on it, it&#39;s just a shape!

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;Winnie,
I&#39;m really sorry to hear of this.
Given that Nelson died three months ago,
I&#39;d describe his health condition
as fairly serious.&quot;

(Laughter)

That&#39;s the worst health condition
you can have, not being alive.
She said, &quot;KINDLY COMPLY
WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.
ONE LOVE.&quot;

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY.&quot;

(Laughter)


(Applause)

She said, &quot;MY BANKER WILL NEED
TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE.&quot;

(Laughter)

I said, &quot;no problemo.
I SHOT THE SHERIFF.&quot;
[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ]

(Laughter)

Thank you.

(Applause)
