[The must-watch TED Talks of 2016]

[Sam Harris: Can we build AI
without losing control over it?]
At a certain point,
we will build machines
that are smarter than we are.
And once we have machines
that are smarter than we are,
they will begin to improve themselves.
We&#39;re in the process
of building some sort of god.
Now would be a good time
to make sure it&#39;s a god we can live with.

[Jennifer Kahn: Gene editing
can wipe out mosquitoes forever]
Gene drives have risks,
and those need to be discussed.
But malaria exists now
and kills 1,000 people a day.
Remember that.
It can be frightening to act,
but sometimes, not acting is worse.

[Jamila Raqib: The secret
to effective nonviolent resistance]
We&#39;re not going to end war
by telling people
that violence is morally wrong.
Instead, we must offer them a tool
that&#39;s at least as powerful
and as effective as violence.

[Alexander Betts: Here&#39;s how
we can fix the refugee system]
Rather than seeing refugees
as inevitably dependent
upon humanitarian assistance,
we need to provide them
with opportunities for human flourishing.

[Adam Foss: A prosecutor&#39;s vision for justice]
Every day, thousands of times a day,
prosecutors around the United States
wield power so great
that it can bring about catastrophe
as quickly as it can bring about
opportunity, intervention, support
and yes, even love.

[Dalia Mogahed: What do you think
when you look at me?]
What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who say,
&quot;We are better than that?&quot;

[Tim Urban: Inside the mind
of a procrastinator]
Both brains have a Rational
Decision-Maker in them,
but the procrastinator&#39;s brain
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
Now, what does this mean
for the procrastinator?
Well, it means everything&#39;s fine,
until this happens.

[Allan Adams: The discovery
of gravitational waves]
Two black holes,
the densest thing in the universe,
one with a mass of 29 Suns
and one with a mass of 36 Suns,
whirling around each other
100 times per second before they collide.
And we know it because we heard it.

[Kenneth Lacovara: Hunting for dinosaurs
showed me our place in the universe]
Why study the ancient past?
Because it gives us perspective.
The dinosaurs died
in the world&#39;s fifth mass extinction,
snuffed out in a cosmic accident
through no fault of their own.
They didn&#39;t have a choice.
We, on the other hand, do have a choice.

[Camille A. Brown: The visual
history of social dance]
Why do we dance?
To move, to let loose, to express.
Why do we dance together?
To heal, to remember,

to say: &quot;We speak a common language.
We exist, and we are free.&quot;
