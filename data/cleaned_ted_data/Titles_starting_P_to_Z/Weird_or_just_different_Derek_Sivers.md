So, imagine you&#39;re standing on a street anywhere in America
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,
&quot;Excuse me, what is the name of this block?&quot;
And you say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that&#39;s Elm Street.
This is 26th, that&#39;s 27th.&quot;
He says, &quot;OK, but what is the name of that block?&quot;
You say, &quot;Well, blocks don&#39;t have names.
Streets have names; blocks are just the
unnamed spaces in between streets.&quot;
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.
So, now imagine you&#39;re standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,
you turn to a person next to you and say,
&quot;Excuse me, what is the name of this street?&quot;
They say, &quot;Oh, well that&#39;s Block 17 and this is Block 16.&quot;
And you say, &quot;OK, but what is the name of this street?&quot;
And they say, &quot;Well, streets don&#39;t have names.
Blocks have names.
Just look at Google Maps here. There&#39;s Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All of these blocks have names,
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.
And you say then, &quot;OK, then how do you know your home address?&quot;
He said, &quot;Well, easy, this is District Eight.
There&#39;s Block 17, house number one.&quot;
You say, &quot;OK, but walking around the neighborhood,
I noticed that the house numbers don&#39;t go in order.&quot;
He says, &quot;Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.
The second house ever built is house number two.
Third is house number three. It&#39;s easy. It&#39;s obvious.&quot;
So, I love that sometimes we need to
go to the opposite side of the world
to realize assumptions we didn&#39;t even know we had,
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.
So, for example, there are doctors in China
who believe that it&#39;s their job to keep you healthy.
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,
and when you&#39;re sick you don&#39;t have to pay them because they failed
at their job. They get rich when you&#39;re healthy, not sick.

In most music, we think of the &quot;one&quot;

as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.
But in West African music, the &quot;one&quot;
is thought of as the end of the phrase,
like the period at the end of a sentence.

So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:
two, three, four, one.
And this map is also accurate.

(Laughter)

There&#39;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,
the opposite is also true.
So, let&#39;s never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,
that the opposite may also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
