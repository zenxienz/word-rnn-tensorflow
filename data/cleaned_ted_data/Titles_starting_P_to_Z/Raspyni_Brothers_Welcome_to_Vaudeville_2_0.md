Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.

Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak
as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...

DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;
it&#39;s something we just kind of learned for this,
so we&#39;re going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?

BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!
Nice show. Man, that was good!

DH: Thank you.

BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.
You actually just did that. 
(Laughter)

That&#39;s the kind of extra effort that&#39;s gotten us where we are today ...

DH: All right, let&#39;s show them something special.

BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...

TED is about invention, let&#39;s be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.

BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props
he has invented and working on.
Right now, Dan&#39;s going to show something he actually invented.

DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,
right after I saw another juggler do it.

BF: Shut up. 
(Laughter)


DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.

(Laughter)


(Applause)

Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It&#39;s not a showstopper
but it certainly slows it down.

BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)

BF: Oh, Daniel.

(Applause)


DH: One more? (Drum roll)
Perfect. (Drum roll)
Perfect. (Drum roll)

BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.

(Applause)


I&#39;m now pushing my luck: I&#39;m skipping right to six cups.
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control
over three with my right hand. (Drum roll)

BF: Also three with his left.

DH: Perfect.

(Laughter)

And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try
or should I miss once on purpose? 
(Laughter)


BF: First try? Once on purpose?

(Audience: Once on purpose!)

DH: How about if I try first and then decide?

BF: Good idea. 
(Laughter)
 Let&#39;s leave that. We&#39;ll leave that door open.

(Laughter)
 
(Applause)


DH: He&#39;s looking at me.

BF: That&#39;s all right, he does that. All right.

DH: Oh! It&#39;s time for Richard&#39;s help. 
(Laughter)

Oh, good. All right.

BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,
it&#39;s kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous
with Richard. And we&#39;ve always done something with the bullwhips
in our act. It&#39;s funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.
And then we thought, &quot;How stupid.&quot;

DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?

BF: I think that&#39;s the next session.

DH: Next session?

BF: Yeah. And so we&#39;ve actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.

DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)
Oh, sorry. 
(Laughter)


DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)

BF: OK, sorry.

DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.

Richard Wurman: Can I say something?

BF: Sure.

RW: In all past years I&#39;ve rehearsed with them,
the things that have happened to me --
I have no idea what&#39;s going to happen and that&#39;s the truth.

DH: All right, please stand here in front ...
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.

(Laughter)


BF: No, come stay up with him.
Dan used to actually hold them but now he&#39;s got you for protection.
It&#39;s kind of neat. OK.

(Laughter)


DH: Wow, you&#39;ve been working out.

BF: No, shut up!

(Laughter)

Having a little bit of Richard time. That&#39;s nice, that&#39;s good.
OK, here we go.
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...

DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.
There you go.

(Laughter)

OK.
OK, hold on.

RW: Hmmm.

(Laughter)


DH: First one.

BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.

(Laughter)


DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?

(Laughter)

What happened there?

BF: I think we were just outside.

DH: I don&#39;t get it. 
(Applause)


(Laughter)


DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.

RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don&#39;t hold me that hard.

BF: Here we go, I&#39;m taking it. (Balloon pops) 
(Applause)


DH: One more, one more.

BF: We&#39;ve got one more we&#39;re going to do.

RW: Do I get to hold them?

BF: You don&#39;t want to hold these, trust me.

DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?

(Laughter)


BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It&#39;s very cool.

(Laughter)


(Applause)


(Laughter)

One more try. Man, I don&#39;t want to get too close.

(Laughter)

Could you just push that?

(Applause)


DH: Wow! Boy!

BF: That&#39;s cool. I always wanted to try that.

(Laughter)


DH: Let&#39;s jump this way, though.
Now, we risked Richard&#39;s life, it&#39;s only fair we risk our own lives.
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.
And if that wasn&#39;t enough, and judging by your response, it&#39;s not ...

(Laughter)


DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.

DH: True. Barry ...

BF: I&#39;m going to run up behind him.

DH: Leap over my shoulder.

BF: Up and over his shoulders.

DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...

(Laughter)

Still juggling. 
(Laughter)

Impossible, you say?

BF: Incredible, you say?

DH: Why bother, you say?

BF: Here we go.

DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?

BF: This guy, this guy invented air.

DH: I think so, that&#39;s right.
Even the pencil.

BF: He invented the pencil.

DH: All right, we&#39;ll do this trick, but please remember
it took us over 10 years to perfect.

BF: Ten years to perfect, which you&#39;re about to see.

DH: It&#39;s not that difficult, we just don&#39;t like to practice that much.

BF: No, it&#39;s a hassle. Traveling too much.
Actually, we will take a second to prove --
this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.

DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal
up onto the stage?

(Laughter)

Or a virgin for a sacrifice?

BF: Anything?

DH: Where&#39;s Gloria? 
(Laughter)


BF: No, she&#39;s got ... farm animal.

DH: Do you have a small farm animal?
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.

BF: Over the top, over the top.

DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?

BF: Yeah, it&#39;s all right.

DH: Do you feel everything&#39;s OK? The atmosphere, the ...

BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.

DH: Everything up here&#39;s OK?

BF: Yeah.

DH: Then here we go.

BF: This one&#39;s a little ... Who&#39;s doing the lights? Could you
point that a little more directly
into my eyeballs? Is that possible? 
(Laughter)
 I can still see a little.

DH: And turn up the intensity; we&#39;re still pink in the middle.
We went too far. 
(Laughter)


BF: Yeah, it&#39;s too far. It&#39;s too much of a visual.
The design of the body is a whole different thing.

DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.

DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence)
May we have it a bit louder?

(Laughter)


BF: They&#39;re a good crew! Whoa!

DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.

BF: We&#39;re going on.

DH: All right, we&#39;ll try again.

BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.

DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.

BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.

DH: Whenever you&#39;re ready.

BF: There we go!

(Applause)


All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!
Somebody dance! Come on!

(Applause)

Wow, wow, OK, stop.
Weird, no one dances. We&#39;re two guys doing this. 
(Laughter)

I think that&#39;s uncomfortable for everyone.

DH: The French judge ...

BF: One more quick thing.

DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.

(Laughter)


BF: Well, you know ...

DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.

DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.

BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read
that we&#39;ve won two world juggling championships.
And believe it or not, you don&#39;t win juggling champions
for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.
We&#39;re going to show you right now
an excerpt from a routine that we used
to wipe out the other juggling team competition.

DH: That&#39;s right.

BF: Good.

DH: I know what you&#39;re thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.

(Laughter)


BF: Juggling&#39;s got a bad rap.

DH: But wait, Barry, there&#39;s still one more club lying there by my foot.
And look, it has a twin!

BF: Shut up. 
(Laughter)


DH: There&#39;s still one more by my foot.
What do you want me to do with it?

BF: Richard you tell him, it&#39;s your last year. 
(Laughter)


DH: That&#39;s a pretty good setup, Richard.

BF: Yeah, it&#39;s a good setup. That&#39;s a big setup.

DH: You can&#39;t get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.

BF: Nice.

DH: I got that --
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.

BF: Nice.

DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.

BF: It&#39;s progress, that&#39;s the thing.

(Laughter)


DH: How about that? I&#39;ll do it again.
Oh wait, it&#39;s on your side, Barry.
And it&#39;s awfully windy over there.

BF: It is, it&#39;s weird. You wouldn&#39;t think
it would affect half the stage, but it is. It&#39;s weird.

Watch this: what I&#39;m going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.

DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!
Oh, look how it lies there.
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can&#39;t do?

(Laughter)

You are my hero. You&#39;re my Jim Shea, Jr.
Too much Olympics.

BF: From my foot, I&#39;ll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.

DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?
What gem of knowledge?
What pearl of wisdom?
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?
Is that your final answer?

BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.

DH: I do, I do.

BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.

DH: We will juggle seven.

BF: From six to seven. DH: That&#39;s a world&#39;s record. BF: Really? DH: For us.

BF: Yes.

DH: Whenever you&#39;re ready there, big guy.
Put your tongue away, Barry.

BF: Oh, oh, whoa.

(Applause)


DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.
Because now, to make this twice as difficult,
we&#39;ll juggle the seven clubs back ...

BF: Seven-club juggling.

DH: ... to back.

BF: Thank you, that&#39;s it.

BF: Thank you guys!

DH: Thank you very much!
