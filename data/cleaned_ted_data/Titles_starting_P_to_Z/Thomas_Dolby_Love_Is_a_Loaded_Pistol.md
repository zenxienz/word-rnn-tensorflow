I&#39;ve been playing TED for nearly a decade,
and I&#39;ve very rarely played
any new songs of my own.
And that was largely because there weren&#39;t any.

(Laughter)

So I&#39;ve been busy with a couple of projects,

and one of them was this:
The Nutmeg.
A 1930s ship&#39;s lifeboat,
which I&#39;ve been restoring in the garden
of my beach house in England.
And, so now,
when the polar ice caps melt,
my recording studio will rise up like an ark,
and I&#39;ll float off into the drowned world
like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.
During the day,
the Nutmeg collects energy
from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,
and from a 450 watt turbine
up the mast.
So that when it gets dark,
I&#39;ve got plenty of power.
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,
and I work on new songs.
I&#39;d like to play to you guys,
if you&#39;re willing to be the first audience to hear it.

(Applause)

It&#39;s about Billie Holiday.
And it appears that,
some night in 1947
she left her physical space
and was missing all night,
until she reappeared in the morning.
But I know where she was.
She was with me on my lifeboat.
And she was hot.
(Music)
♫ Billie crept softly ♫
♫ into my waking arms ♫
♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫
♫ Strange fruit for ♫
♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫
♫ Panic at the stage door ♫
♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫
♫ &quot;Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL&quot; ♫
♫ Must have left the building ♫
♫ body and soul ♫
♫ On a creaky ♫
♫ piano stool tonight ♫
♫ as the moon is my ♫
♫ only witness ♫
♫ She was breathing ♫
♫ in my ear ♫
♫ &quot;This time it&#39;s love&quot; ♫
♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫
♫ By daybreak she&#39;s gone ♫
♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫
♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫
♫ See in the new age ♫
♫ alone ♫
♫ Stay with me ♫
♫ again tonight ♫
♫ Billie, time, ♫
♫ time is a wily trickster ♫
♫ Still an echo ♫
♫ in my heart says, ♫
♫ &quot;This time it&#39;s love&quot; ♫

(Applause)
