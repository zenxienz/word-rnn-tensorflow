(Applause)

Thank you. Ooh, I&#39;m like, &quot;Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now.&quot; 
(Laughter)

Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is
people scream out, &quot;What&#39;s she doing?!&quot;
I&#39;ll play at these rock shows, be on stage
standing completely still, and they&#39;re like,
&quot;What&#39;s she doing?! What&#39;s she doing?!&quot;
And then I&#39;ll kind of be like -- (Vvvwow!) -- and then they&#39;re like, &quot;Whoa!&quot;

(Laughter)

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re trying to figure out,
&quot;Well, how does this thing work?&quot;
Well, what I&#39;m doing is
controlling the pitch with my left hand.
See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets --
(Portamento) --
and you can get it really low.
And with this hand I&#39;m controlling the volume,
so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.
(Tones)
So basically, with both of your hands
you&#39;re controlling pitch and volume and kind of
trying to create the illusion that you&#39;re doing separate notes,
when really it&#39;s continuously going ...
(Flourish ... Beep)

(Laughter)


Sometimes I startle myself: I&#39;ll forget that I have it on,
and I&#39;ll lean over to pick up something,
and then it goes like -- (Blip) -- &quot;Oh!&quot;
And it&#39;s like a funny sound effect that follows you around
if you don&#39;t turn the thing off.

(Laughter)

Maybe we&#39;ll go into the next tune,
because I totally lost where this is going.

We&#39;re going to do a song by David Mash called &quot;Listen: the Words Are Gone,&quot;
and maybe I&#39;ll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax.
(Music)

(Applause)

So, I&#39;m trying to think of some of the questions
that are commonly asked; there are so many.
And ... Well, I guess I could tell you
a little of the history of the theremin.
It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, LÃ©on Theremin
-- he also was a musician besides an inventor --
he came up with the idea for making the theremin,
I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.
And there&#39;d be that sound in the signal -- it&#39;s like (Screeching) --
and he thought, &quot;Oh, what if I could control that sound
and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it.&quot;
And so somehow through developing that,
he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now.
And a lot of times, even kids nowadays,
they&#39;ll make reference to a theremin by going, &quot;Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,&quot;
because in the &#39;50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies,
that sound that&#39;s like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

(Laughter)

It&#39;s kind of a funny, goofy sound to do.
And sometimes if I have too much coffee,
then my vibrato gets out of hand.
You&#39;re really sensitive to your body and its functions
when you&#39;re behind this thing.
You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.
It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing --
because you&#39;re fighting so hard to keep the balance
with what you&#39;re playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time
you don&#39;t want to focus so much on being in tune all the time;
you want to be feeling the music.
And then also, you&#39;re trying to stay very, very, very still
because little movements with other parts of your body
will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you&#39;re holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) --
and breathing will make it ...

(Laughter)

If I pass out on the next song ...

(Laughter)

I think of it almost like
like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware
of every little crazy thing your body is doing,
or just aware of what you don&#39;t want it to be doing
while you&#39;re playing; you don&#39;t want to have any sudden movements.
And if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like,
&quot;Here, have some drinks on us!&quot;
And it&#39;s like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m about to go on soon;
I don&#39;t want to be like -- (Teetering tones) -- you know?&quot;
It really does reflect the mood that you&#39;re in also,
if you&#39;re ...
it&#39;s similar to being a vocalist, except
instead of it coming out of your throat,
you&#39;re controlling it just in the air
and you don&#39;t really have a point of reference;
you&#39;re always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.
You just have to always adjust to what&#39;s happening
and realize you&#39;ll have bummer notes come here and there
and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on,
or else you&#39;ll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me.
I think we will play another tune now.
I&#39;m going to do &quot;Lush Life.&quot; It&#39;s one of my favorite tunes to play.
(Music)
