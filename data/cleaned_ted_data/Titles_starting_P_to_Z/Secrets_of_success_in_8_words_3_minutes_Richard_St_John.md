This is really a two-hour presentation
I give to high school students,
cut down to three minutes.
And it all started one day
on a plane, on my way to TED,
seven years ago.
And in the seat next to me
was a high school student, a teenager,
and she came from a really poor family.
And she wanted to make
something of her life,
and she asked me a simple little question.
She said, &quot;What leads to success?&quot;
And I felt really badly,
because I couldn&#39;t give her a good answer.
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.
And I think, jeez, I&#39;m in the middle
of a room of successful people!
So why don&#39;t I ask them
what helped them succeed,
and pass it on to kids?
So here we are, seven years,
500 interviews later,
and I&#39;m going to tell you
what really leads to success
and makes TEDsters tick.
And the first thing is passion.
Freeman Thomas says,
&quot;I&#39;m driven by my passion.&quot;
TEDsters do it for love;
they don&#39;t do it for money.
Carol Coletta says, &quot;I would pay
someone to do what I do.&quot;

And the interesting thing is:
if you do it for love,
the money comes anyway.
Work! Rupert Murdoch said
to me, &quot;It&#39;s all hard work.
Nothing comes easily.
But I have a lot of fun.&quot;
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!

(Laughter)

TEDsters do have fun working.
And they work hard.
I figured, they&#39;re not workaholics.
They&#39;re workafrolics.

(Laughter)

Good!

(Applause)

Alex Garden says, &quot;To be successful,
put your nose down in something
and get damn good at it.&quot;
There&#39;s no magic;
it&#39;s practice, practice, practice.
And it&#39;s focus.
Norman Jewison said to me,
&quot;I think it all has to do
with focusing yourself on one thing.&quot;
And push!
David Gallo says, &quot;Push yourself.
Physically, mentally,
you&#39;ve got to push, push, push.&quot;
You&#39;ve got to push through shyness
and self-doubt.
Goldie Hawn says,
&quot;I always had self-doubts.
I wasn&#39;t good enough;
I wasn&#39;t smart enough.
I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it.&quot;
Now it&#39;s not always easy to push yourself,
and that&#39;s why they invented mothers.

(Laughter)


(Applause)

Frank Gehry said to me,
&quot;My mother pushed me.&quot;

(Laughter)

Serve!
Sherwin Nuland says,
&quot;It was a privilege to serve as a doctor.&quot;
A lot of kids want to be millionaires.

The first thing I say is:
&quot;OK, well you can&#39;t serve yourself;
you&#39;ve got to serve others
something of value.
Because that&#39;s the way
people really get rich.&quot;
Ideas!

TEDster Bill Gates says, &quot;I had an idea:
founding the first micro-computer
software company.&quot;
I&#39;d say it was a pretty good idea.
And there&#39;s no magic to creativity
in coming up with ideas --
it&#39;s just doing some very simple things.
And I give lots of evidence.
Persist!
Joe Kraus says,
&quot;Persistence is the number
one reason for our success.&quot;
You&#39;ve got to persist through failure.
You&#39;ve got to persist through crap!
Which of course means &quot;Criticism,
Rejection, Assholes and Pressure.&quot;

(Laughter)


So, the answer to this question is simple:
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.

(Laughter)

Or failing that, do
the eight things -- and trust me,
these are the big eight things
that lead to success.
Thank you TEDsters
for all your interviews!

(Applause)
