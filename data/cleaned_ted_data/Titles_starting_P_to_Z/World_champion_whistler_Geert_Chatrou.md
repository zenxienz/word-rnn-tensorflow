Thank you.

Thank you very much.
That was whistling.
I&#39;m trying to do this in English.
What is a chubby,
curly-haired guy from Holland --
why is he whistling?
Well actually, I&#39;ve been whistling
since the age of four, about four.
My dad was always whistling
around the house,
and I just thought that&#39;s part
of communication in my family.
So I whistled along with him.
And actually, until I was 34,
I always annoyed and irritated
people with whistling,
because, to be honest,
my whistling is a kind
of deviant behavior.
I whistled alone,
I whistled in the classroom,
I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere.
And I also whistled
at a Christmas Eve party
with my family-in-law.
And they had some, in my opinion,
terrible Christmas music.
And when I hear music that I don&#39;t like,
I try to make it better.

(Laughter)

So when &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer&quot; -- you know it?
(Whistling)
But it can also sound like this.
(Whistling)
But during a Christmas party --
at dinner, actually -- it&#39;s very annoying.
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times,
&quot;Please stop whistling.&quot;
And I just couldn&#39;t.
And at one point --
and I had some wine,
I have to admit that --
at one point I said,
&quot;If there was a contest, I would join.&quot;
And two weeks later,

I received a text message:
&quot;You&#39;re going to America.&quot;

(Laughter)

So, OK, I&#39;m going to America.
I would love to, but why?
So I immediately called her up, of course.
She googled, and she found
this World Whistling Championship
in America, of course.

(Laughter)

She didn&#39;t expect me to go there.
And I would have lost my face.
I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s correct English.
But the Dutch people here
will understand what I mean.

(Laughter)

I lost my face.

(Applause)

And she thought, &quot;He will never go there.&quot;
But actually, I did.
So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina,
southeast of the United States,
and I entered the world of whistling.
And I also entered the World Championship,
and I won there, in 2004.

(Applause)

That was great fun, of course.
And to defend my title --
like judokas do and sportsmen --
I thought, well let&#39;s go back in 2005 --
and I won again.

(Laughter)

Then I couldn&#39;t participate
for a few years.
And in 2008, I entered again
in Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.
So what happened now
is I&#39;m standing here in Rotterdam,
in the beautiful city, on a big stage,
and I&#39;m talking about whistling.
And actually, I earn my money
whistling, at the moment.
So I quit my day job as a nurse.

(Applause)

And I try to live my dream --
well, actually, it was never my dream,
but it sounds so good.

(Laughter)

OK, I&#39;m not the only one whistling here.
You say, &quot;Huh, what do you mean?&quot;
Well actually, you are going
to whistle along.

And then always the same thing happens:
people are watching each other
and think, &quot;Oh, my God.
Why? Can I go away?&quot;
No, you can&#39;t.

(Laughter)

Actually, it&#39;s very simple.
The track that I will whistle
is called &quot;FÃªte de la Belle.&quot;
It&#39;s about 80 minutes long.

(Laughter)

No, no, no. It&#39;s four minutes long.
And I want to first rehearse
with you your whistling.
Yes, so I whistle the tone.
(Whistling)

(Laughter)

Sorry, I forgot one thing --
you whistle the same tone as me.

(Laughter)

I heard a wide variety of tones.
(Geert Chatrou and audience whistling)
(Whistling ends)
This is very promising.

(Laughter)

This is very promising.
I&#39;ll ask the technicians
to start the music.
And if it&#39;s started,
I just point where you whistle along,
and we will see what happens.

(Laughter)

Oh, I&#39;m so sorry, technicians.

(Laughter)

I&#39;m so used to that.

(Laughter)

I start it myself.

(Laughter)

OK, here it is.

(Laughter)

(Music)
(Whistling)
(Whistling ends)
(Music)
OK.
(Whistling)
It&#39;s easy, isn&#39;t it?
(Whistling)
Now comes the solo,
I propose I do that myself, OK?
(Music)
(Whistling)

(Applause)
