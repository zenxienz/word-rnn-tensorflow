The theme of my talk today is,
&quot;Be an artist, right now.&quot;
Most people, when this subject is brought up,

get tense and resist it:
&quot;Art doesn&#39;t feed me, and right now I&#39;m busy.
I have to go to school, get a job,
send my kids to lessons ... &quot;
You think, &quot;I&#39;m too busy. I don&#39;t have time for art.&quot;
There are hundreds of reasons why we can&#39;t be artists right now.
Don&#39;t they just pop into your head?
There are so many reasons why we can&#39;t be,
indeed, we&#39;re not sure why we should be.
We don&#39;t know why we should be artists,
but we have many reasons why we can&#39;t be.
Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted
or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
And some of you may think you&#39;ve strayed too far from art.
Well you might have, but I don&#39;t think so.
This is the theme of my talk today.
We are all born artists.
If you have kids, you know what I mean.
Almost everything kids do is art.
They draw with crayons on the wall.
They dance to Son Dam Bi&#39;s dance on TV,
but you can&#39;t even call it Son Dam Bi&#39;s dance -- it becomes the kids&#39; own dance.
So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,
and because they practice such art all day long,
people honestly get a little tired around kids.
Kids will sometimes perform monodramas --
playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
And some kids, when they get a bit older,
start to lie.
Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
They&#39;re shocked.
&quot;Now you&#39;re showing your true colors,&quot; Mom says. She thinks, &quot;Why does he take after his dad?&quot;
She questions him, &quot;What kind of a person are you going to be?&quot;
But you shouldn&#39;t worry.
The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
They are talking about things they didn&#39;t see.
It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s a wonderful moment.
Parents should celebrate.
&quot;Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!&quot;
All right! It calls for celebration.
For example, a kid says, &quot;Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home.&quot;
Then a typical mom responds, &quot;Stop that nonsense.&quot;

Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:
&quot;Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?
Where did you meet it?&quot; &quot;Um, in front of the supermarket.&quot;
When you have a conversation like this,
the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
Soon, a story develops.
Of course this is an infantile story,
but thinking up one sentence after the next
is the same thing a professional writer like me does.
In essence, they are not different.
Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert&#39;s novels,
&quot;Flaubert did not write a novel.
He merely connected one sentence after another.
The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert&#39;s novel.&quot;
That&#39;s right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,
then, without violating the scope of the first one,
writing the next sentence.
And you continue to make connections.

Take a look at this sentence:
&quot;One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.&quot;
Yes, it&#39;s the first sentence of Franz Kafka&#39;s &quot;The Metamorphosis.&quot;
Writing such an unjustifiable sentence
and continuing in order to justify it,
Kafka&#39;s work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
Kafka did not show his work to his father.
He was not on good terms with his father.
On his own, he wrote these sentences.
Had he shown his father, &quot;My boy has finally lost it,&quot; he would&#39;ve thought.
And that&#39;s right. Art is about going a little nuts
and justifying the next sentence,
which is not much different from what a kid does.
A kid who has just started to lie
is taking the first step as a storyteller.
Kids do art.
They don&#39;t get tired and they have fun doing it.
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.
But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,
making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,
but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
But parents tell them,
&quot;It will all be washed away by the waves.&quot;
In other words, it&#39;s useless.
There&#39;s no need.
But kids don&#39;t mind.
They have fun in the moment
and they keep playing in the sand.
Kids don&#39;t do it because someone told them to.
They aren&#39;t told by their boss
or anyone, they just do it.
When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,
many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,
or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.
Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
They talk about these kinds of experiences.
You must have had such a moment.
In that moment, art makes you happy
because it&#39;s not work.
Work doesn&#39;t make you happy, does it? Mostly it&#39;s tough.
The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
It&#39;s a bit mischievous, actually.
&quot;Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired.&quot;
Right? Why would work tire us if it&#39;s in our nature?
Playing doesn&#39;t tire us.
We can play all night long.
If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
Why? Because it&#39;s tiring and we feel fatigue.
But kids, usually they do art for fun. It&#39;s playing.
They don&#39;t draw to sell the work to a client
or play the piano to earn money for the family.
Of course, there were kids who had to.
You know this gentleman, right?
He had to tour around Europe to support his family --
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart --
but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.
Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework
and of course they take piano or ballet lessons,
but they aren&#39;t fun anymore.
You&#39;re told to do it and there&#39;s competition. How can it be fun?
If you&#39;re in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,
you&#39;ll surely get in trouble with your mom.
Besides,
if you continue to act like an artist as you get older,
you&#39;ll increasingly feel pressure --
people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.

Here&#39;s my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
I was trying my best, and my teacher came around
and asked me, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m drawing diligently,&quot; I said.
&quot;Why are you using only black?&quot;
Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
And I explained,
&quot;It&#39;s a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch.&quot;
Then my teacher said,
&quot;Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling.&quot;
Or so I wished.
&quot;Now you&#39;ll get it, you rascal!&quot; was the response. 
(Laughter)

&quot;You&#39;ll get it!&quot; he said.
You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,
but I was coloring everything in black,
so he dragged me out of the group.
There were a lot of girls there as well,
so I was utterly mortified.
None of my explanations or excuses were heard,
and I really got it big time.
If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,
&quot;Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,
but he has a gift for making up stories,&quot; and he would have encouraged me.
But such a teacher is seldom found.
Later, I grew up and went to Europe&#39;s galleries --
I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.
Look what I found. 
(Laughter)

Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished
and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
Look at this. Doesn&#39;t it look just like wallpaper?
Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn&#39;t explained by a lame story like mine.
No crows are brought up.
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.
Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century
is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --
essentially the same as I did.
Of course, my work was very amateur,
but let&#39;s turn to more famous examples.
This is Picasso&#39;s.
He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it &quot;Bull&#39;s Head.&quot; Sounds convincing, right?
Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called &quot;Fountain&quot;.
That was Duchamp.
So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --
that&#39;s indeed what contemporary art is all about.
Picasso even made the statement,
&quot;I draw not what I see but what I think.&quot;
Yes, it means I didn&#39;t have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.
Unfortunately, the little artists within us
are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
They get locked in.
That&#39;s our tragedy.
So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
Our artistic desire doesn&#39;t go away.
We want to express, to reveal ourselves,
but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing
&quot;She&#39;s Gone&quot; or &quot;Hotel California,&quot;
miming the guitar riffs.
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
Some people turn into rockers like this.
Or some people dance in clubs.
People who would have enjoyed telling stories
end up trolling on the Internet all night long.
That&#39;s how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.
Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids
playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
They go, &quot;Don&#39;t touch it. Daddy will do it for you.&quot;
The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,
but the dad alone builds castles.
This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
You know the song &quot;I would love to be on TV&quot;? Why would we love it?
TV is full of people who do what we wished to do,
but never got to.
They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.
So we start to envy them.
We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
&quot;He just can&#39;t act.&quot; &quot;You call that singing? She can&#39;t hit the notes.&quot;
We easily say these sorts of things.
We get jealous, not because we&#39;re evil,
but because we have little artists pent up inside us.
That&#39;s what I think.
What should we do then?
Yes, that&#39;s right.
Right now, we need to start our own art.
Right this minute, we can turn off TV,
log off the Internet,
get up and start to do something.
Where I teach students in drama school,
there&#39;s a course called Dramatics.
In this course, all students must put on a play.
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.
They can write the play, for example,
and the writers may work on stage art.
Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,
but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.

I have another experience:
In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
I have students like you in the class -- many who don&#39;t major in writing.
Some major in art or music and think they can&#39;t write.
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.

It can be a simple theme:
Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.

There&#39;s one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!
I walk around and encourage them,
&quot;Come on, come on!&quot; They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.
They only get to think for the first five minutes.
The reason I make them write like crazy is because
when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,
the artistic devil creeps in.
This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons

why you can&#39;t write:
&quot;People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!
What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!&quot;
It will say a lot of things.
You have to run fast so the devil can&#39;t catch up.
The really good writing I&#39;ve seen in my class
was not from the assignments with a long deadline,
but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did
in front of me with a pencil.
The students go into a kind of trance.
After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they&#39;re writing.
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.

So I can say this:
It&#39;s not the hundreds of reasons why one can&#39;t be an artist,
but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
Why we cannot be something is not important.
Most artists became artists because of the one reason.
When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,
enemies appear on the outside.
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. 
(Laughter)

Sometimes they look like our spouses,
but they are not your parents or spouses.
They are devils. Devils.
They came to Earth briefly transformed
to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.
And they have a magic question.
When we say, &quot;I think I&#39;ll try acting. There&#39;s a drama school in the community center,&quot; or
&quot;I&#39;d like to learn Italian songs,&quot; they ask, &quot;Oh, yeah? A play? What for?&quot;
The magic question is, &quot;What for?&quot;
But art is not for anything.
Art is the ultimate goal.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
So in response to such a pragmatic question,
we need to be bold.
&quot;Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,&quot;
is what you should say. &quot;I&#39;ll just go ahead and do it anyway.&quot;
The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,
at least one of which is an artist.
Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,
and in front of me I saw something related to a play.
So I asked the driver, &quot;What is this?&quot;
He said it was his profile. &quot;Then what are you?&quot; I asked. &quot;An actor,&quot; he said.
He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, &quot;What roles do you usually play?&quot;
He proudly said he played King Lear.
King Lear.
&quot;Who is it that can tell me who I am?&quot; -- a great line from King Lear.
That&#39;s the world I dream of.
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,
secretly or publicly performing their own arts.
In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.
The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport

and a reporter asked her a typical question:
&quot;What do you have to do to become a great dancer?
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?&quot;
Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.
In 1990, she was asked this question.

And here&#39;s what she answered:
&quot;Just do it.&quot;
Wow. I was touched.
Only those three words and she left the airport. That&#39;s it.
So what should we do now?
Let&#39;s be artists, right now. Right away. How?
Just do it!
Thank you.

(Applause)
