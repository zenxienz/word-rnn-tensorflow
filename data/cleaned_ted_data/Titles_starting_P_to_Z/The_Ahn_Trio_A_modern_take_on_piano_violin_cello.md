Thank you so much.
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen,
sharing our music with you.
What an exciting and inspiring event.
What you just heard is &quot;Skylife&quot; by David Balakrishnan.
We want to play you one more selection.
It&#39;s by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.
And we talk about different ideas --
he had this idea
that he thought music should be from the heart.
This was in the middle of the 20th century
when music from the heart, beautiful music,
wasn&#39;t the most popular thing in the classical music world.
It was more atonal and twelve-tone.
And he insisted on beautiful music.
So this is &quot;Oblivion&quot; by Astor Piazzolla.
Thank you.
