This song is one of Thomas&#39; favorites,
called &quot;What You Do with What You&#39;ve Got.&quot;
♫ You must know someone like him ♫
♫ He was tall and strong and lean ♫
♫ With a body like a greyhound ♫
♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫
♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫
♫ grew twisted around itself ♫
♫ Till almost everything he did ♫
♫ brought pain to someone else ♫
♫ It&#39;s not just what you&#39;re born with ♫
♫ It&#39;s what you choose to bear ♫
♫ It&#39;s not how big your share is ♫
♫ It&#39;s how much you can share ♫
♫ It&#39;s not the fights you dreamed of ♫
♫ It&#39;s those you really fought ♫
♫ It&#39;s not what you&#39;ve been given ♫
♫ It&#39;s what you do with what you&#39;ve got ♫
♫ What&#39;s the use of two strong legs ♫
♫ if you only run away? ♫
♫ And what&#39;s the use of the finest voice ♫
♫ if you&#39;ve nothing good to say? ♫
♫ What&#39;s the use of strength and muscle ♫
♫ if you only push and shove? ♫
♫ And what&#39;s the use of two good ears ♫
♫ if you can&#39;t hear those you love? ♫
♫ What&#39;s the use of two strong legs ♫
♫ if you only run away? ♫
♫ And what&#39;s the use of the finest voice ♫
♫ if you&#39;ve nothing good to say? ♫
♫ What&#39;s the use of strength and muscle ♫
♫ if you only push and shove? ♫
♫ And what&#39;s the use of two good ears ♫
♫ if you can&#39;t hear those you love? ♫
♫ Between those who use their neighbors ♫
♫ and those who use the cane ♫
♫ Between those in constant power ♫
♫ and those in constant pain ♫
♫ Between those who run to glory ♫
♫ and those who cannot run ♫
♫ Tell me which ones are the cripples ♫
♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫
♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫
♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫

(Applause)
 Thank you very much.
