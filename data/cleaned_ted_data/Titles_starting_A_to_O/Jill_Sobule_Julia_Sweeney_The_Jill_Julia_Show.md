♫ I first saw you and I got so shy. ♫
♫ You see, I was a little paranoid &#39;cause I might have been high. ♫
♫ And I hadn&#39;t done that in ages and I won&#39;t do that again. ♫
♫ But that&#39;s another story. ♫
♫ Loved you forever and I&#39;ve been a big fan, ♫
♫ the one-woman shows, I even rented &quot;Pat.&quot; ♫
♫ I got enough nerve to come up to you, ♫
♫ but little did I know one year later we&#39;d be doing this show. ♫

♫ I sing. Julia Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

♫ Sobule: Sometimes it works. Sweeney: Sometimes it doesn&#39;t. ♫

♫ Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

♫ Sweeney: At a conference in Monterey next to the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫
♫ I first saw you and I wasn&#39;t so shy. ♫
I made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was
ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox, and Wendy
and I wanted you to do the theme song.
And then the pilot didn&#39;t go and I was so sad,
but I kept remaining a fan of yours.
And then when I went through that big, horrible breakup with Carl
and I couldn&#39;t get off the couch, I listened to your song,
♫ &quot;Now That I Don&#39;t Have You,&quot; ♫ over and over and over and over again.
And I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re here and that I&#39;m meeting you here at TED.
And also, I can&#39;t believe that we&#39;re eating sushi
in front of the fish tank,
which, personally, I think is really inappropriate.

(Laughter)


(Applause)

And little did I know that one year later ... ♫ we&#39;d be doing this show. ♫

♫ Sobule: I sing. Sweeney: I tell stories. Together: The Jill and Julia Show. ♫

Sobule: Hey, they asked us back! Sweeney: Can you stand it?!

♫ Together: The Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia, the Jill and Julia Show. ♫

♫ Sobule: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫
♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫
♫ Why are all our heroes so imperfect? ♫
♫ Statue in the park has lost his crown. ♫

♫ William Faulkner, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Mmm.

♫ Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: I know.

♫ And that guy, &quot;Seven Years in Tibet,&quot; turned out to be a Nazi. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah.

♫ Founding fathers all had slaves. ♫ Sweeney: I know.

♫ The explorers slaughtered the braves. ♫ Sweeney: Horribly.

♫ Sobule: The Old Testament God can be so petty. ♫

Sweeney: Don&#39;t get me started on that. 
(Laughter)


♫ Sobule: Paul McCartney, jealous of John, even more so now that he&#39;s gone. ♫
♫ Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie. ♫

♫ Pablo Picasso, cruel to his wives. ♫ Sweeney: Horrible.

♫ Sobule: My favorite poets took their own lives. ♫
♫ Orson Welles peaked at twenty-five, below before our eyes. ♫
♫ And he sold bad wine. ♫

♫ Together: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? Yeah ♫
♫ Why do they always bring me down? ♫

♫ Sobule: Heard Babe Ruth was full of malice. ♫ Sweeney: Oh.

♫ Lewis Carroll I&#39;m sure did Alice. ♫ Sweeney: What?!

♫ Plato in the cave with those very young boys. ♫ Sweeney: Ooh...

♫ Sobule: Hillary supported the war. ♫

♫ Sweeney: Even Thomas Friedman supported the war. ♫ 
(Laughter)


♫ Sobule: Colin Powell turned out to be ... Together: ... such a pussy. ♫ 
(Laughter)
 
(Applause)


♫ Sobule: William Faulkner, drunk and depressed, ♫

♫ Tennessee Williams, drunk and depressed. ♫ Sweeney: Yeah.

♫ Sobule: Take it, Julia. ♫

Sweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine.
I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I&#39;m home in Spokane
visiting my mother. And to my mother,
Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope,
which is actually saying something because she&#39;s a devout Catholic.
Anyway, I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness,
I like her weight issues,
I like how she&#39;s transformed talk television,
I like how she&#39;s brought reading back to America --
but there was something that happened the last two weeks

that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment:
it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.
And that was that she did two entire shows
promoting that movie &quot;The Secret.&quot;
Do you guys know about that movie &quot;The Secret&quot;?
It makes &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know&quot; seem like a doctoral dissertation
from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that&#39;s how bad it is.
It makes &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; seem like &quot;War and Peace.&quot;
That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.
And the basic idea is
that there&#39;s this law of attraction, and
your thoughts have this vibrating energy
that goes out into the universe
and then you attract good things to happen to you.
On a scientific basis, it&#39;s more than just &quot;Power of Positive Thinking&quot; --
it has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,
it&#39;s because you&#39;ve just been thinking negative thoughts.
Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she&#39;s promoting it.
And all I&#39;m saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann
would go on Oprah
and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.
So that&#39;s what I have to say.

(Laughter)
