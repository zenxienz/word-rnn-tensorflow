Chris Anderson: You guys were amazing.
That&#39;s amazing.

(Applause)

You just don&#39;t hear that every day.

(Laughter)

Usman, the official story is that
you learned to play the guitar
by watching Jimmy Page on YouTube.

Usman Riaz: Yes, that was the first one. And then I --
That was the first thing I learned,
and then I started progressing to other things.
And I started watching Kaki King a lot,
and she would always cite Preston Reed as a big influence,
so then I started watching his videos,
and it&#39;s very surreal right now to be --

(Laughter)


(Applause)


CA: Was that piece just now,
that was one of his songs that you learned, or how did that happen?

UR: I&#39;d never learned it before,
but he told me that we would be playing that on stage,
so I was familiar with it, so that&#39;s why I had so much more fun learning it.
And it finally happened, so ...

(Laughter)


CA: Preston, from your point of view,
I mean, you invented this like 20 years ago, right?
How does it feel to see someone like this
come along taking your art and doing so much with it?

Preston Reed: It&#39;s mind-blowing,
and I feel really proud, really honored.
And he&#39;s a wonderful musician, so it&#39;s cool.

(Laughter)


CA: I guess, I don&#39;t think there is like a one-minute other piece you guys can do?
Can you? Do you jam? Do you have anything else?

PR: We haven&#39;t prepared anything.

CA: There isn&#39;t. I&#39;ll tell you what.
If you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
and you have another 30 or 40 seconds,
and we just see that, I just think --
I can feel it. We want to hear a little more.
And if it goes horribly wrong, no worries.
