I&#39;m here to show you
how something you can&#39;t see can be so much fun to look at.
You&#39;re about to experience a new, available
and exciting technology that&#39;s going to make us rethink
how we waterproof our lives.
What I have here is a cinder block
that we&#39;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray
that can be applied to almost any material.
It&#39;s called Ultra-Ever Dry,
and when you apply it to any material,
it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.
So this is a cinder block, uncoated,
and you can see that it&#39;s porous, it absorbs water.
Not anymore.
Porous, nonporous.
So what&#39;s superhydrophobic?
Superhydrophobic is how we measure
a drop of water on a surface.
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,
and if it&#39;s really round, it&#39;s superhydrophobic.
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump
to about 90 degrees.
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.
But what you&#39;re seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,
and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.
So as part of the demonstration,
what I have is a pair of gloves,
and we&#39;ve coated one of the gloves
with the nanotechnology coating,
and let&#39;s see if you can tell which one,
and I&#39;ll give you a hint.
Did you guess the one that was dry?
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,
what&#39;s occurred is that we&#39;re able to now
look at atoms and molecules and actually control them
for great benefits.
And we&#39;re talking really small here.
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,
and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,
and to put some scale to that,
if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,
and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,
you&#39;d be the width of a human hair.
So very small, but very useful.
And it&#39;s not just water that this works with.
It&#39;s a lot of water-based materials like concrete,
water-based paint,
mud,
and also some refined oils as well.
You can see the difference.
Moving onto the next demonstration,
we&#39;ve taken a pane of glass and we&#39;ve coated the outside of it,
we&#39;ve framed it with the nanotechnology coating,
and we&#39;re going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,
and you&#39;re going to see, it&#39;s going to spread out on glass
like you&#39;d normally think it would,
except when it hits the coating, it stops,
and I can&#39;t even coax it to leave.
It&#39;s that afraid of the water.

(Applause)

So what&#39;s going on here? What&#39;s happening?
Well, the surface of the spray coating
is actually filled with nanoparticles
that form a very rough and craggly surface.
You&#39;d think it&#39;d be smooth, but it&#39;s actually not.
And it has billions of interstitial spaces,
and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,
reach up and grab the air molecules,
and cover the surface with air.
It&#39;s an umbrella of air all across it,
and that layer of air is what the water hits,
the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.
So if I put this inside this water here,
you can see a silver reflective coating around it,
and that silver reflective coating
is the layer of air that&#39;s protecting the water
from touching the paddle, and it&#39;s dry.
So what are the applications?
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says,
&quot;Oh, I could use it for this and this and this.&quot;
The applications in a general sense
could be anything that&#39;s anti-wetting.
We&#39;ve certainly seen that today.
It could be anything that&#39;s anti-icing,
because if you don&#39;t have water, you don&#39;t have ice.
It could be anti-corrosion.
No water, no corrosion.
It could be anti-bacterial.
Without water, the bacteria won&#39;t survive.
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.
So imagine how something like this
could help revolutionize your field of work.
And I&#39;m going to leave you with one last demonstration,
but before I do that, I would like to say thank you,
and think small.

(Applause)

It&#39;s going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

Chris Anderson: You guys didn&#39;t hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? 
(Laughter)

[Two minutes later...]
He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.
It&#39;s happening!

(Applause)
