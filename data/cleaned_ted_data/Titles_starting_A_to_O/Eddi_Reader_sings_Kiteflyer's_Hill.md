This is about a place in London
called Kiteflyer&#39;s Hill
where I used to go and spend hours
going &quot;When is he coming back? When is he coming back?&quot;
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I&#39;ve got over.
But this is &quot;Kiteflyer&#39;s Hill.&quot;
It&#39;s a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,
actually, for me.
Boo Hewerdine, Thomas Dolby,
thank you very much for inviting me. It&#39;s been a blessing singing for you.
Thank you very much.
♫ Do you remember when we used to go ♫
♫ up to Kiteflyer&#39;s Hill? ♫
♫ Those summer nights, so still ♫
♫ with all of the city beneath us ♫
♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫
♫ before cruel and foolish words ♫
♫ were cruelly and foolishly said ♫
♫ Some nights I think of you ♫
♫ and then I go up ♫
♫ on Kiteflyer&#39;s Hill ♫
♫ wrapped up against the winter chill ♫
♫ And somewhere in the city beneath me ♫
♫ you lie asleep in your bed ♫
♫ and I wonder if ever just briefly ♫
♫ do I creep in your dreams now and then ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ My wild summer love ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫
♫ And do you think of me sometimes ♫
♫ up on Kiteflyer&#39;s Hill? ♫
♫ Oh, I pray you one day will ♫
♫ We won&#39;t say a word ♫
♫ We won&#39;t need them ♫
♫ Sometimes silence is best ♫
♫ We&#39;ll just stand in the still of the evening ♫
♫ and whisper farewell to loneliness ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ My wild summer love ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ Do you think of me sometimes? ♫
♫ And do you ever make that climb? ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ My wild summer love ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ Have the years been kind? ♫
♫ And do you ever make that climb ♫
♫ up on Kiteflyer&#39;s Hill? Kiteflyer&#39;s ... ♫
♫ [French] ♫
♫ Where are you? Where are you now? ♫
♫ Where are you now? ♫
♫ Kiteflyer&#39;s ... ♫

(Applause)

Gracias. Thank you very much.
