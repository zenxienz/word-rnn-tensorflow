I haven&#39;t told many people this,
but in my head, I&#39;ve got
thousands of secret worlds all going on
all at the same time.
I am also autistic.
People tend to diagnose autism
with really specific 
check-box descriptions,
but in reality, it&#39;s a whole
variation as to what we&#39;re like.
For instance, my little brother,
he&#39;s very severely autistic.
He&#39;s nonverbal. He can&#39;t talk at all.
But I love to talk.
People often associate autism
with liking maths and 
science and nothing else,
but I know so many autistic people
who love being creative.
But that is a stereotype,
and the stereotypes of things
are often, if not always, wrong.
For instance, a lot of people
think autism and think 
&quot;Rain Man&quot; immediately.
That&#39;s the common belief,
that every single autistic 
person is Dustin Hoffman,
and that&#39;s not true.
But that&#39;s not just with 
autistic people, either.
I&#39;ve seen it with LGBTQ people,
with women, with POC people.
People are so afraid of variety
that they try to fit everything 
into a tiny little box
with really specific labels.
This is something that actually

happened to me in real life:
I googled &quot;autistic people are ...&quot;
and it comes up with suggestions
as to what you&#39;re going to type.
I googled &quot;autistic people are ...&quot;
and the top result was &quot;demons.&quot;
That is the first thing that people think
when they think autism.
They know.

(Laughter)

One of the things I can do 
because I&#39;m autistic —
it&#39;s an ability rather than a disability —
is I&#39;ve got a very, very vivid imagination.
Let me explain it to you a bit.
It&#39;s like I&#39;m walking in two 
worlds most of the time.
There&#39;s the real world, 
the world that we all share,
and there&#39;s the world in my mind,
and the world in my mind 
is often so much more real
than the real world.
Like, it&#39;s very easy for 
me to let my mind loose
because I don&#39;t try and fit 
myself into a tiny little box.
That&#39;s one of the best 
things about being autistic.
You don&#39;t have the urge to do that.
You find what you want to do,
you find a way to do it, 
and you get on with it.
If I was trying to fit myself into a box,
I wouldn&#39;t be here, I 
wouldn&#39;t have achieved
half the things that I have now.
There are problems, though.
There are problems with being autistic,
and there are problems with
having too much imagination.
School can be a problem in general,
but having also to explain to a teacher
on a daily basis
that their lesson is inexplicably dull
and you are secretly taking refuge
in a world inside your head in 
which you are not in that lesson,
that adds to your list of problems.

(Laughter)

Also, when my imagination takes hold,
my body takes on a life of its own.
When something very exciting
happens in my inner world,
I&#39;ve just got to run.
I&#39;ve got to rock backwards and forwards,
or sometimes scream.
This gives me so much energy,
and I&#39;ve got to have an 
outlet for all that energy.
But I&#39;ve done that ever 
since I was a child,
ever since I was a tiny little girl.
And my parents thought it was 
cute, so they didn&#39;t bring it up,
but when I got into school,
they didn&#39;t really agree that it was cute.
It can be that people 
don&#39;t want to be friends
with the girl that starts 
screaming in an algebra lesson.
And this doesn&#39;t normally 
happen in this day and age,
but it can be that people don&#39;t want 
to be friends with the autistic girl.
It can be that people 
don&#39;t want to associate
with anyone who won&#39;t 
or can&#39;t fit themselves
into a box that&#39;s labeled normal.
But that&#39;s fine with me,
because it sorts the wheat from the chaff,
and I can find which people 
are genuine and true
and I can pick these people as my friends.
But if you think about it, what is normal?
What does it mean?
Imagine if that was the best 
compliment you ever received.
&quot;Wow, you are really normal.&quot;

(Laughter)

But compliments are,
&quot;you are extraordinary&quot;
or &quot;you step outside the box.&quot;
It&#39;s &quot;you&#39;re amazing.&quot;
So if people want to be these things,
why are so many people 
striving to be normal?
Why are people pouring their 
brilliant individual light into a mold?
People are so afraid of variety 
that they try and force everyone,
even people who don&#39;t want 
to or can&#39;t, to become normal.
There are camps for LGBTQ people
or autistic people to try and 
make them this &quot;normal,&quot;
and that&#39;s terrifying that people 
would do that in this day and age.
All in all, I wouldn&#39;t trade my autism
and my imagination for the world.
Because I am autistic,
I&#39;ve presented documentaries to the BBC,
I&#39;m in the midst of writing a book,
I&#39;m doing this — this is fantastic —
and one of the best 
things that I&#39;ve achieved,
that I consider to have achieved,
is I&#39;ve found ways of communicating
with my little brother and sister,
who as I&#39;ve said are nonverbal. 
They can&#39;t speak.
And people would often write
off someone who&#39;s nonverbal,
but that&#39;s silly, because 
my little brother and sister
are the best siblings that 
you could ever hope for.
They&#39;re just the best, 
and I love them so much
and I care about them 
more than anything else.

I&#39;m going to leave you with one question:
If we can&#39;t get inside the person&#39;s minds,
no matter if they&#39;re autistic or not,
instead of punishing anything
that strays from normal,
why not celebrate uniqueness
and cheer every time someone
unleashes their imagination?
Thank you.

(Applause)
