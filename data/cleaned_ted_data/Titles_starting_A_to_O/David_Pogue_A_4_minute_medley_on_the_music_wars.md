Ladies and gentlemen,
the history of music and television on the Internet
in three minutes.
A TED medley --
a TEDley.
♫ It&#39;s nine o&#39; clock on a Saturday ♫
♫ The record store&#39;s closed for the night ♫
♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫
♫ And soon I am feelin&#39; all right ♫
♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫
♫ With one dollar pricing that rocks ♫
♫ I can type in the track and get album names back ♫
♫ While still in my PJs and socks ♫
♫ Sell us a song, you&#39;re the music man ♫
♫ My iPod&#39;s still got 10 gigs to go ♫
♫ Yes, we might prefer more compatibility ♫
♫ But Steve likes to run the whole show ♫
♫ I heard &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; was great last night ♫
♫ But I had a bad piece of cod ♫
♫ As I threw up my meal, I thought, &quot;It&#39;s no big deal&quot; ♫
♫ I&#39;ll watch it tonight on my &#39;Pod ♫
♫ And now all of the networks are joining in ♫
♫ Two bucks a show without ads ♫
♫ It&#39;s a business those guys always wanted to try ♫
♫ But only Steve Jobs had the &#39;nads ♫
♫ They say we&#39;re young, don&#39;t watch TV ♫
♫ They say the Internet is all we see ♫
♫ But that&#39;s not true; they&#39;ve got it wrong ♫
♫ See, all our shows are just two minutes long ♫
♫ Hey ♫
♫ I got YouTube ♫
♫ I got YouTube ♫
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America --
the RIAA!
♫ Young man, you were surfin&#39; along ♫
♫ And then, young man, you downloaded a song ♫
♫ And then, dumb man, copied it to your &#39;Pod ♫
♫ Then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫
♫ You&#39;ve just been sued by the R-I-A-A ♫
♫ You&#39;ve just been screwed by the R-I-A-A ♫
♫ Their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫
♫ And there&#39;d better not be a next time ♫
♫ They&#39;ve lost their minds at the R-I-A-A ♫
♫ Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A ♫
♫ You&#39;re depriving the bands ♫
♫ You are learning to steal ♫
♫ You can&#39;t do whatever you feel ♫
♫ CD sales have dropped every year ♫
♫ They&#39;re not greedy, they&#39;re just quaking with fear ♫
♫ Yes indeedy, what if their end is near ♫
♫ And we download all our music ♫
♫ Yeah, that would piss off the R-I-A-A ♫
♫ No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A ♫
♫ What a way to make friends ♫
♫ It&#39;s a plan that can&#39;t fail ♫
♫ All your customers off to jail ♫
♫ Who&#39;ll be next for the R-I-A-A? ♫
♫ What else is vexing the R-I-A-A? ♫
♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫
♫ Maybe humming along ♫
♫ Maybe mocking &#39;em in a song ♫
