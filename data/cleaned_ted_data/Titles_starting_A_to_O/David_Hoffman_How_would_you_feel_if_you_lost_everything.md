I had a fire nine days ago.

My archive:
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,
all my books, my dad&#39;s books, my photographs.
I&#39;d collected --
I was a collector, major, big-time.
It&#39;s gone.
I just looked at it,
and I didn&#39;t know what to do.
I mean, this was --
was I my things?
I always live in the present -- I love the present.
I cherish the future.
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,
like, you&#39;ve got to make something good out of something bad.
You&#39;ve got to make something good out of something bad.
This was bad! Man, I was --
I cough. I was sick.
That&#39;s my camera lens. The first one --
the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.
That&#39;s my feature film. &quot;King, Murray&quot;
won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --
the only print I had.
That&#39;s my papers.
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.
&quot;You&#39;ve got to make something good out of something bad,&quot;
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.
By the way, that&#39;s &quot;Sputnik.&quot; I ran it last year.
&quot;Sputnik&quot; was downtown, the negative. It wasn&#39;t touched.
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,
which opens in New York in two weeks
downtown.
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, &quot;Come dig.&quot;
That&#39;s me at my desk.
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.
You know -- all the stuff.
That&#39;s my daughter, Jean.
She came. She&#39;s a nurse in San Francisco.
&quot;Dig it up,&quot; I said. &quot;Pieces.
I want pieces. Bits and pieces.&quot;

I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,
which I&#39;m just starting to work on -- my next project.
That&#39;s my sister. She took care of pictures,
because I was a big collector of snapshot photography
that I believed said a lot.
And those are some of the pictures that --
something was good about the burnt pictures.
I didn&#39;t know. I looked at that --
I said, &quot;Wow, is that better than the --&quot;
That&#39;s my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.
It&#39;s the only copy I had. Pieces of it.
Idea about women.
So I started to say, &quot;Hey, man, you are too much!
You could cry about this.&quot; I really didn&#39;t.
I just instead said,
&quot;I&#39;m going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... &quot;
And I appreciate this moment
to come up on this stage with so many people
who&#39;ve already given me so much solace,

and just say to TEDsters:
I&#39;m proud of me. That I take something bad,
I turn it, and I&#39;m going to make something good out of this,
all these pieces.
That&#39;s Arthur Leipzig&#39;s original photograph I loved.
I was a big record collector --
the records didn&#39;t make it. Boy, I tell you,
film burns. Film burns.
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.
The negatives are gone.
That&#39;s my father&#39;s letter to me, telling me to
marry the woman I first married when I was 20.
That&#39;s my daughter and me.
She&#39;s still there. She&#39;s there this morning, actually.
That&#39;s my house.
My family&#39;s living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.
That&#39;s my wife, Heidi,
who didn&#39;t take it as well as I did.
My children, Davey and Henry.
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.
So, my message to you folks,
from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance
to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.
I came to live it, and I am living it.
That&#39;s my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,
just 35 miles from here.
Thank you everybody.

(Applause)
