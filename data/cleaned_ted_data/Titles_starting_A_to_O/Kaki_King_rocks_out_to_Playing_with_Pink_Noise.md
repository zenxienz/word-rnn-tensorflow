I was thinking about my place in the universe,
and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,
when I was a child.
And I thought that if time could reach
forwards and backwards infinitely,
doesn&#39;t that mean that
every point in time is really infinitely small,
and therefore somewhat meaningless.
So we don&#39;t really have a place in the universe,
as far as on a time line.
But nothing else does either.
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment
that&#39;s ever happened, including this moment right now.
And so therefore this music you&#39;re about to hear
is maybe the most important music
you&#39;ll ever hear in your life.

(Applause)

Thank you.

(Applause)

For those of you who I&#39;ll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards,
you could please refrain from saying,
&quot;Oh my god, you&#39;re so much shorter in real life.&quot;

(Laughter)

Because it&#39;s like the stage is an optical illusion,
for some reason.

(Laughter)

Somewhat like the curving of the universe.
I don&#39;t know what it is. I get asked in interviews a lot,
&quot;My god, you&#39;re guitars are so gigantic!&quot;

(Laughter)

&quot;You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars.&quot;

(Laughter)


(Applause)

Thank you very much.
