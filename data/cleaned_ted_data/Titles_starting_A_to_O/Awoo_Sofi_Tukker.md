Sophie Hawley-Weld: OK,
you don&#39;t have to stand up,
but ...
we can see you really clearly --

(Laughter)

So you have to dance with us.
And we have this, like,
choreographed dance thing
that we&#39;re about to do --

Betta Lemme: Really easy.

SHW: And we&#39;re going to flick
our wrists like this,
and you&#39;re going to do it with us.
And you can also stand up.
(Music)
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
Awoo!
I know I did not raise a wrist
I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
Awoo!

BL: (Speaks) There you go!
(Music)

SHW: We have another one coming up.
It&#39;s a little finger-pointing dance.
(Music)
The people sitting down,
I want to see your fingers pointing.
Yeah!
(Sings) I know I did not raise a wrist
(Both sing) I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
Aaaa ...

(Applause)

Awoo!
(Music)
(Clapping to the beat)
(Music)
Aaaa ...

SHW: (Speaks) Alright, hand flick.
(Both sing) I know
I did not raise a wrist
I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
I know I did not raise a wrist
I know I did not capture it
It came, it came,
it went, it went
It conquered quick
I was there and then I quit
(Music)

Tucker Halpern: You guys are way more fun
than I thought you&#39;d be.

(Laughter)

(Music)
Awoo!

(Applause)


SHW: Thank you so much.

(Applause)
