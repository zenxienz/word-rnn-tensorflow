My name is Joshua Walters.
I&#39;m a performer.
(Beatboxing)

(Laughter)


(Applause)

But as far as being a performer,
I&#39;m also diagnosed
bipolar.
I reframe that as a positive
because the crazier I get onstage,
the more entertaining I become.
When I was 16 in San Francisco,
I had my breakthrough manic episode
in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.
Maybe you thought that was scary,
but actually there&#39;s no amount of drugs you can take
that can get you as high
as if you think you&#39;re Jesus Christ.

(Laughter)

I was sent to a place,
a psych ward,
and in the psych ward,
everyone is doing their own one-man show.

(Laughter)

There&#39;s no audience like this
to justify their rehearsal time.
They&#39;re just practicing.
One day they&#39;ll get here.
Now when I got out,
I was diagnosed
and I was given medications
by a psychiatrist.
&quot;Okay, Josh, why don&#39;t we give you some --
why don&#39;t we give you some Zyprexa.
Okay? Mmhmm?
At least that&#39;s what it says on my pen.&quot;

(Laughter)

Some of you are in the field, I can see.
I can feel your noise.
The first half of high school
was the struggle of the manic episode,
and the second half
was the overmedications of these drugs,
where I was sleeping through high school.
The second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class.
When I got out
I had a choice.
I could either deny
my mental illness
or embrace
my mental skillness.
(Bugle sound)
There&#39;s a movement going on right now
to reframe mental illness as a positive --
at least the hypomanic edge part of it.
Now if you don&#39;t know what hypomania is,
it&#39;s like an engine that&#39;s out of control,
maybe a Ferrari engine, with no breaks.
Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,
have that creative edge,
if you know what I&#39;m talking about.
You&#39;re driven to do something
that everyone has told you is impossible.
And there&#39;s a book -- John Gartner.
John Gartner wrote this book called &quot;The Hypomanic Edge&quot;
in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner and Steve Jobs
and all these business minds
have this edge to compete.
A different book was written not too long ago
in the mid-90s
called &quot;Touched With Fire&quot; by Kay Redfield Jamison
in which it was looked at in a creative sense
in which Mozart and Beethoven and Van Gogh
all have this manic depression that they were suffering with.
Some of them committed suicide.
So it wasn&#39;t all
the good side of the illness.
Now recently,
there&#39;s been development in this field.
And there was an article written in the New York Times,
September 2010,

that stated:
&quot;Just Manic Enough.&quot;
Just be manic enough
in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs
that have this kind of spectrum --
you know what I&#39;m talking about --
not maybe full bipolar,
but they&#39;re in the bipolar spectrum --
where on one side,
maybe you think you&#39;re Jesus,
and on the other side
maybe they just make you a lot of money.

(Laughter)

Your call. Your call.
And everyone&#39;s somewhere in the middle.
Everyone&#39;s somewhere in the middle.
So maybe, you know,
there&#39;s no such thing
as crazy,
and being diagnosed with a mental illness
doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re crazy.
But maybe it just means
you&#39;re more sensitive
to what most people can&#39;t see
or feel.
Maybe no one&#39;s really crazy.
Everyone is just a little bit mad.
How much
depends on where you fall in the spectrum.
How much
depends on how lucky you are.
Thank you.

(Applause)
