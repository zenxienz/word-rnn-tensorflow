You know, what I do is write for children,
and I&#39;m probably America&#39;s
most widely read children&#39;s author, in fact.
And I always tell people
that I don&#39;t want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,
and no one has ever chose farmer.
I&#39;m here today to talk to you
about circles and epiphanies.
And you know, an epiphany
is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.
You&#39;ve just got to go around the block
to see it as an epiphany.
That&#39;s a painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.
It&#39;s the kind of complicated circle
that I&#39;m going to tell you about.
My circle began back in the &#39;60s
in high school in Stow, Ohio
where I was the class queer.
I was the guy beaten up bloody
every week in the boys&#39; room,
until one teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom
in the teachers&#39; lounge.
She did it in secret.
She did it for three years.
And I had to get out of town.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,
and I ended up in San Francisco, California --
met a lover --
and back in the &#39;80s, found it necessary
to begin work on AIDS organizations.
About three or four years ago,
I got a phone call in the middle of the night
from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,
who said, &quot;I need to see you.
I&#39;m disappointed
that we never got to know each other as adults.
Could you please come to Ohio,
and please bring that man
that I know you have found by now.
And I should mention
that I have pancreatic cancer,
and I&#39;d like you to please
be quick about this.&quot;
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,
and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.
We found her one, we got her there,
and we took care of her
and watched over her family,
because it was necessary.
It&#39;s something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult
got to know me,
she turned into a box of ashes
and was placed in my hands.
And what had happened
was the circle had closed,
it had become a circle --
and that epiphany I talked about
presented itself.
The epiphany is
that death is a part of life.
She saved my life;
I and my partner saved hers.
And you know, that part of life needs everything
that the rest of life does.
It needs truth and beauty,
and I&#39;m so happy it&#39;s been mentioned so much here today.
It also needs --
it needs dignity,
love and pleasure,
and it&#39;s our job to hand those things out.
Thank you.

(Applause)
