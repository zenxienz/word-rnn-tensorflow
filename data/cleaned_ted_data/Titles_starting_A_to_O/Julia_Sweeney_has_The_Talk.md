I have a daughter, Mulan.
And when she was eight, last year,
she was doing a report for school
or she had some homework about frogs.
And we were at this restaurant,
and she said, &quot;So, basically,
frogs lay eggs
and the eggs turn into tadpoles,
and tadpoles turn into frogs.&quot;
And I said, &quot;Yeah. You know, I&#39;m not really up on my frog reproduction that much.
It&#39;s the females, I think, that lay the eggs,
and then the males fertilize them.
And then they become tadpoles and frogs.&quot;
And she says, &quot;What? Only the females have eggs?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;
And she goes, &quot;And what&#39;s this fertilizing?&quot;
So I kind of said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s this extra ingredient,
you know, that you need
to create a new frog
from the mom and dad frog.&quot; 
(Laughter)

And she said, &quot;Oh, so is that true for humans too?&quot;
And I thought, &quot;Okay, here we go.&quot;
I didn&#39;t know it would happen so quick, at eight.
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,
and all I could remember was,
&quot;Only answer the question they&#39;re asking.
Don&#39;t give any more information.&quot; 
(Laughter)

So I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
And she said, &quot;And where do, um,
where do human women,
like, where do women lay their eggs?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Well,
funny you should ask. 
(Laughter)

We have evolved to have our own pond.
We have our very own pond inside our bodies.
And we lay our eggs there,
we don&#39;t have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.
It&#39;s our own pond. And that&#39;s how it happens.&quot;
And she goes, &quot;Then how do they get fertilized?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Well,
Men, through their penis,
they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.
And you go through the woman&#39;s vagina.&quot;
And so we&#39;re just eating, and her jaw just drops,
and she goes, &quot;Mom!
Like, where you go to the bathroom?&quot;
And I said, &quot;I know.
I know.&quot;

(Laughter)

That&#39;s how we evolved. It does seem odd.
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant
right next to an amusement park ...
Bad zoning, but ...&quot; 
(Laughter)

She&#39;s like, &quot;What?&quot; And she goes, &quot;But Mom,
but men and women can&#39;t ever see each other naked, Mom.
So how could that ever happen?&quot;
And then I go, &quot;Well,&quot; and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.
&quot;Human males and females
develop a special bond,
and when they&#39;re much older, much, much older than you,
and they have a very special feeling,
then they can be naked together.&quot;
And she said, &quot;Mom,
have you done this before?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
And she said, &quot;But Mom, you can&#39;t have kids.&quot;
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can&#39;t have kids.
And I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;
And she said, &quot;Well, you don&#39;t have to do that again.&quot;
And I said, &quot;...&quot;
And then she said, &quot;But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?
Like, how do they know that&#39;s the time?
Mom, does the man just say,
&#39;Is now the time to take off my pants?&#39;&quot;

(Laughter)

And I said, &quot;Yes.&quot;

(Laughter)

&quot;That is exactly right.
That&#39;s exactly how it happens.&quot;
So we&#39;re driving home and she&#39;s looking out the window, and she goes,
&quot;Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,
like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Oh, no. Humans are so private.
Oh ...&quot;
And then she goes, &quot;What if there was like a party,
and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,
and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?
Would that ever happen?&quot;
And I said, &quot;Oh, no, no.
That&#39;s not how we do it.&quot;
Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,
&quot;Mom, how do cats do it?&quot;
And I go, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s the same. It&#39;s basically the same.&quot;
And then she got all caught up in the legs. &quot;But how would the legs go, Mom?
I don&#39;t understand the legs.&quot;
She goes, &quot;Mom, everyone can&#39;t do the splits.&quot;
And I go, &quot;I know, but the legs ...&quot;
and I&#39;m probably like, &quot;The legs get worked out.&quot;
And she goes, &quot;But I just can&#39;t understand it.&quot;
So I go, &quot;You know, why don&#39;t we go on the Internet,
and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia.&quot; 
(Laughter)

So we go online, and we put in &quot;cats mating.&quot;
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there&#39;s many cats mating videos.
And we watched them and I&#39;m so thankful,
because she&#39;s just like, &quot;Wow! This is so amazing.&quot;
She goes, &quot;What about dogs?&quot;
So we put in dogs mating, and,
you know, we&#39;re watching it, and she&#39;s totally absorbed.
And then she goes, &quot;Mom,
do you think they would have, on the Internet,
any humans mating?&quot;

(Laughter)

And then I realized that
I had taken my little eight year old&#39;s hand,
and taken her right into Internet porn. 
(Laughter)

And I looked into this
trusting, loving face,
and I said,
&quot;Oh, no.
That would never happen.&quot;
Thank you.

(Applause)

Thank you.

(Applause)

Thank you. I&#39;m so happy to be here.
