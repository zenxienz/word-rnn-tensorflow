Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.

Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.
We&#39;re so excited to be here.
It&#39;s such an honor.
Like he said, we&#39;re
three brothers from New Jersey --
you know, the bluegrass
capital of the world.

(Laughter)

We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,
and we fell in love with it.
We hope you guys will too.
This next song is an original
we wrote called &quot;Time Lapse,&quot;
and it will probably live up to its name.

TM: Thank you very much.

RM: I&#39;m just going to take
a second to introduce the band.
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.

(Applause)

On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.

(Applause)

He&#39;s also our brother.
And I&#39;m Robbie, and I&#39;m 14,
and I play the fiddle.

(Applause)

As you can see, we decided
to make it hard on ourselves,
and we chose to play three songs
in three different keys.
(Tuning)
Yeah. I&#39;m also going to explain,
a lot of people want to know
where we got the name
&quot;Sleepy Man Banjo Boys&quot; from.
So, it started when Jonny was little,
and he first started the banjo,
he would play on his back
with his eyes closed,
and we&#39;d say it looked
like he was sleeping.
So you can probably piece
the rest together.

TM: We can&#39;t really figure out the reason.
It might have been
that it weighs about a million pounds.
