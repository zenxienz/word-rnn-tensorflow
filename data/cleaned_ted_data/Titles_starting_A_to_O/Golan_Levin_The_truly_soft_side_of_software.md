Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,
only to find out that you&#39;re a performance artist.

(Laughter)

I&#39;m also a software engineer,
and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.
And I think the main thing that I&#39;m interested in
is trying to find a way of
making the computer into a personal mode of expression.
And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,

and in a way those are my bane:
I think there&#39;s a great homogenizing force
that software imposes on people and limits the way they think
about what&#39;s possible on the computer.
Of course, it&#39;s also a great liberating force that makes possible,
you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more
than what most people think, and my art has just been about
trying to find a personal way of using the computer,
and so I end up writing software to do that.
Chris has asked me to do a short performance,
and so I&#39;m going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --
to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment
to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.
Thank you.

(Applause)

We&#39;ve got about a minute left.
I&#39;d just like to show a clip from a most recent project.
I did a performance with two singers
who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;
we repeated it in England.
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them
with a large screen.
We used a computer vision tracking system
in order to know where they were.
And since we know where their heads are,
and we have a wireless mic on them
that we&#39;re processing the sound from,
we&#39;re able to create visualizations
which are linked very tightly to what they&#39;re doing with their speech.
This will take about 30 seconds or so.
He&#39;s making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.
Well, suffice it to say it&#39;s not all like that, but that&#39;s part of it.
Thanks very much. There&#39;s always lots more.
I&#39;m overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you&#39;re in New York,
you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,
and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.
And with that, I think I should give up the stage,
so, thank you so much.
