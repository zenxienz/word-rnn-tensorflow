So I was trained to become a gymnast
for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.
When I was in the first grade, the government
wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,
all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, &quot;No.&quot;
My parents wanted me to become
an engineer like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,

they firmly believed there&#39;s only one sure way to happiness:
a safe and well-paid job.
It is not important if I like the job or not.
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer.
That is me playing my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start training young
to learn acrobatics,
so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I even wrote to the school principal
and the host of a radio show.
But no adults liked the idea.
No adults believed I was serious.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids,
just as powerless as I was.
So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained.
My dream would never come true.
I was afraid that for the rest of my life
some second-class happiness
would be the best I could hope for.
But that&#39;s so unfair.
So I was determined to find another calling.
Nobody around to teach me? Fine.
I turned to books.
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice
from this book by a family of writers and musicians.[&quot;Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei&quot;]
I found my role model of an independent woman
when Confucian tradition requires obedience.[&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;]
And I learned to be efficient from this book.[&quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;]
And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.
[&quot;Complete Works of Sanmao&quot; (aka Echo Chan)] [&quot;Lessons From History&quot; by Nan Huaijin]
I came to the U.S. in 1995,
so which books did I read here first?
Books banned in China, of course.
&quot;The Good Earth&quot; is about Chinese peasant life.
That&#39;s just not convenient for propaganda. Got it.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.

(Laughter)

That&#39;s a topic for a different day.

But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany:
&quot;You shall honor your father and mother.&quot;
&quot;Honor,&quot; I said. &quot;That&#39;s so different,
and better, than obey.&quot;
So it becomes my tool to climb out
of this Confucian guilt trap
and to restart my relationship with my parents.
Encountering a new culture also started my habit
of comparative reading.
It offers many insights.
For example, I found this map out of place at first
because this is what Chinese students grew up with.
It had never occurred to me,
China doesn&#39;t have to be at the center of the world.
A map actually carries somebody&#39;s view.
Comparative reading actually is nothing new.
It&#39;s a standard practice in the academic world.
There are even research fields
such as comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast gives scholars
a more complete understanding of a topic.
So I thought, well, if comparative reading
works for research, why not do it in daily life too?
So I started reading books in pairs.
So they can be about people --
[&quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; by Walter Isaacson][&quot;John Adams&quot; by David McCullough] --
who are involved in the same event,
or friends with shared experiences.

[&quot;Personal History&quot; by Katharine Graham][&quot;The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,&quot; by Alice Schroeder]
I also compare the same stories in different genres -- 
(Laughter)


[Holy Bible: King James Version][&quot;Lamb&quot; by Chrisopher Moore] --
or similar stories from different cultures,
as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.[&quot;The Power of Myth&quot; by Joseph Campbell]
For example, both the Christ and the Buddha
went through three temptations.
For the Christ, the temptations
are economic, political and spiritual.

For the Buddha, they are all psychological:
lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
So if you know a foreign language, it&#39;s also fun
to read your favorite books in two languages.

Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain.
For example, it&#39;s through translation that I realized
&quot;happiness&quot; in Chinese literally means &quot;fast joy.&quot; Huh!
&quot;Bride&quot; in Chinese literally means &quot;new mother.&quot; Uh-oh.

(Laughter)

Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people
of the past and the present.
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again.
Having a dream shattered really is nothing
compared to what many others have suffered.
I have come to believe that coming true
is not the only purpose of a dream.
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch
with where dreams come from,
where passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a shattered dream can do that for you.
So because of books, I&#39;m here today,
happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity,
most of the time.
So may books be always with you.
Thank you.

(Applause)

Thank you. 
(Applause)

Thank you.
