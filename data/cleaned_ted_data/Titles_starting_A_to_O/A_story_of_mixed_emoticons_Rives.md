This means, &quot;I&#39;m smiling.&quot;
So does that.
This means &quot;mouse.&quot;
&quot;Cat.&quot;
Here we have a story.
The start of the story, where this means guy,
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.
Here&#39;s where it happens.
These are when.
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.
She wears it every day.
It&#39;s not considered vintage --
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.
Look at her posture; it&#39;s remarkable.
That&#39;s because she dances.
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,
&quot;Honestly, geez, what are my chances?&quot;

(Laughter)

And he could say, &quot;Oh my God!&quot;
or &quot;I heart you!&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m laughing out loud.&quot;
&quot;I want to give you a hug.&quot;
But he comes up with that, you know.
He tells her, &quot;I&#39;d like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug.&quot;

(Laughter)

Put a crab inside it.
Add some water.
Seven different salts.
He means he&#39;s got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,
but just panhandle at the ocean.
He says, &quot;You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz.&quot;
And the girl goes, &quot;Wha&#39;?&quot;
So, the guy replies, &quot;Yeah, I know, I know.
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.
At least, that&#39;s how it seems.
I&#39;m like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.
Right now, talking to you, I&#39;m not even really a guy.
I&#39;m a monkey --

(Laughter)
 --
blowing kisses
at a butterfly.
But I&#39;m still suggesting you and I should meet.
First, soon, and then a lot.
I&#39;m thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,
but I&#39;ll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.
Hell, ponytail alone.
I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.
I got a pencil you can borrow.
You can put it in your phone.&quot;
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.
She just says, &quot;No thank you.&quot;
You know?
[ &quot;i don&#39;t need 2 write it down.&quot; ]

(Applause)
