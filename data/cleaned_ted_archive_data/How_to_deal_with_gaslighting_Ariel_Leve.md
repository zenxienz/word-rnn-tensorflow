right now the world is experiencing what
I experienced everyday as a child there
is chaos there is confusion everything
is upside-down reality is being
cancelled and nothing means anything
the term gaslighting refers to when
someone manipulates you into questioning
your own sanity it&#39;s a term we are
hearing a lot of right now and it&#39;s a
term I&#39;m very familiar with people are
perhaps confused with how to manage and
cope with the situation now for I can
help when I was in my mid-thirties I had
a meeting with my editor and it was my
first major journalism assignment for
the Sunday Times Magazine I&#39;d gone to
meet him for a drink and I was feeling
hopeful I was feeling like things might
work out and as I was leaving another
writer arrived this writer
recognized me from when I was a child
and he said are you so and so&#39;s daughter
and I replied yes
and he&#39;d been a guest at one of my
mother&#39;s dinner parties
after I left this meeting my editor told
me that he had said how I always
wondered how that little girl would
survive
I had thought her only chances were
suicide or murder when he told me this
line I felt validation because here was
this person who had actually witnessed
what I knew to be true and it confirmed
what I knew
so he had said two options suicide or
murder why would he say that
and what does this have to do with gas
lighting I grew up in an environment
that from the outside seemed privileged
and envied Abel
my mother was a very glamorous poet and
an artist and they were always very
interesting people around he was a
bohemian world
she loved entertaining and there would
be raucous parties on weeknights I would
be in my bed trying to go to sleep and I
would be woken up with drunken laughter
and noise outside the bedroom and
sometimes these people would come into
my room to escape from the crowd and
they would sit and they would smoke and
they would use the bathroom and other
times they would get up in my nightgown
and open the door and shout desperately
please can people be quiet it&#39;s a school
night I have to go to sleep I have to
get up tomorrow
my mother would reply Ariel come join
the party
or she would say after the belly dancer
everyone will go home it was total
bombardment so the following morning
what would happen is I would confront
her about the situation and it was as
though this disruption had never
happened what I thought had happened I
was being told had not happened and that
I was making a big deal out of nothing
if I confronted her with the fact they
were batted away I was sprayed with
words of adoration and words of contempt
you&#39;re stupid idiot and I wish you had
never been born when I confronted her
about having said this to me I was told
I was making it up and that it was a lie
so it wasn&#39;t just that my reality was
canceled but my perceptions of real
ality were overwritten and one of the
most insidious things about gaslighting
is the denial of reality being denied
what you have seen with your own eyes
and you know to be true being denied an
experience that you have had and you
know is real for me the erasure of the
abuse was worse than the abuse so it can
make you crazy but you are not crazy
I developed four strategies they helped
me and at the time I didn&#39;t even know
they were strategies so in these
uncertain times I&#39;m going to share them
with you and maybe they can help you to
number one is to remain defiant when I
was little girl I wrote a story about
running away from home and when my
mother saw the story she said it wasn&#39;t
true and demanded I change it and I
didn&#39;t change it I actually yelled out I
am not changing my story I&#39;m not this
defiance was key because I was trusting
my version of reality and not allowing
it to be altered on demand this anger
protected me I knew what I knew and it
couldn&#39;t be erased so the person
gaslighting you will often try to bully
you but being defiant is something that
does not make you difficult it&#39;s being
resilient now recognize that you will
never get accountability in my late
twenties I tried to confront the truth
about what happened in my childhood I
was sitting with my mother in a Japanese
restaurant
and I said the words child abuse for the
first time out loud I said it playfully
so she didn&#39;t feel like it was an attack
on her and immediately her response was
what about mommy abuse nobody ever talks
about that so what I learned in that
moment was that she would never be able
to take accountability for her actions
she would never get it she would never
say oh you&#39;re right you have a point
and that acknowledgement was not in the
cards asserting myself was not just
useful but it was harmful because the
person gaslighting you will never be
able to respond to logic or reason and
so if you think that you can apply logic
and reason you&#39;re going to feel let down
with this recognition you are no longer
powerless letting go of the wish for it
to be different this is a big one for me
because the wish for it to be different
is very powerful it inoculate cyou to
the tumult it allows you to continue to
believe that logic and reason will
prevail and after a particularly bad
episode my mother would reassure me that
it would never happen again
it would happen again promises were
broken and I realized that I could not
rely on her word with gaslighting the
person gaslighting you makes you feel as
though the ground is always shifting
beneath your feet and that you have no
center of gravity you want things to
make sense but they won&#39;t engaging with
someone who is gaslighting you means you
will never feel heard so what&#39;s the
solution
you stop engaging
you put yourself first number four would
be to develop a healthy detachment I had
to develop coping mechanisms when I was
a child the back and forth and the push
and pull of affection was emotional
whiplash you&#39;re wonderful you&#39;re
horrible I love you I hate you I had to
protect myself by believing that nothing
meant anything so if you can&#39;t invest in
anything the other person says what
happens well when you grow up there&#39;s a
price for me what had been adaptive as a
child became maladaptive as an adult so
trusting was very difficult
I was always needing verification I
became vigilant about clarity there was
no room for misunderstanding and there
was no margin for error
somebody asked me once what are you
looking for in a relationship and I
replied certainty I needed certainty in
an uncertain world but we live in an
uncertain world and so there has to be a
way to find balance detaching from
gaslighting does not mean total
detachment
it means distinguishing between the
world of the gas lighter and the real
world so you can let people have their
alternative facts you&#39;ll stick to
reality so if the only options for me
were suicide or murder how did I survive
well there was actually a third option
writing it down this was my way of
making sense of the chaos by organizing
it on the page this
spent this was real weather the writing
was published or not it was something
that had to be written to say what
needed to be said to validate my reality
even if it was disavowed which it was it
was testimony ironically it was my
mother who passed on to me the tools
that I needed in order to survive
because she always championed freedom of
speech through writing and by telling my
story it was and continues to be an act
of redemption thank you
