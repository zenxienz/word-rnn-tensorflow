so this picture was taken a civil
Mountain in South Africa and that was
one of the hardest things that I&#39;ve ever
done I had to overcome my fear of
heights and I had to push myself to do
some things that I would never out I
would not otherwise have done and
through it all I knew that I couldn&#39;t
look down because it I did out freeze
but when I got to the top it was worth
it
the picture is a symbol for my journey
in discovering my purpose as a social
entrepreneur seven years ago I was a
software engineer working for one of the
largest companies in the world building
social networking software for large
organizations the work I did was
important but I wasn&#39;t fulfilled I knew
I had to do something different so I
quit my job and I applied for an MBA as
a way to change careers and I got into
MIT and I started learning about people
living at the base of the pyramid people
in places like Legos I mean probably
Gaussian I was born here I went to
school here I was raised here Lagos is
the best city in the world yeah that&#39;s
for sure
I mean who wouldn&#39;t love Legos it&#39;s
electric but it was really tough for me
because the Legos that I love so much
had millions and millions of people
living at the base of the pyramid that
were really struggling I remember when I
watch the BBC documentary welcome to
Lagos and I couldn&#39;t look away because
even though had been living in Lagos I
didn&#39;t realize how bad some people
really had it so I knew that I had to do
something about it and along the line we
cycle as what started we cycle gets
people to collect recyclable waste from
their communities in exchange for points
which they can then redeem for household
items electronics and even cash the
waste is then processed and sold to
large-scale with cyclists
the households are basically been
engaged to clean up the communities in
order to improve their lives when I left
MIT I came to Nigeria I faced a lot of
doubts because people didn&#39;t understand
my obsession with whisks they couldn&#39;t
get it but when they saw how passionate
I was and how I was able to get people
to support me it quickly became very
supportive it&#39;s really tough being a
social entrepreneur we&#39;ve had issues
with money there were times when we
couldn&#39;t make payroll there were times
when our subscribers of our subscribers
didn&#39;t support us because they felt the
winner getting enough reward and we had
to figure out a business model we have
to figure out the most efficient way to
transport waste we have to devise a
system for teaching people how to
recycle on a large scale and we have to
be sustainable and we went from a point
where we were 100% reliant on grants
through a point where now over 80% of
our revenue is from the waste that we
collect and thank you and we&#39;re not
making investments that make us
profitable so this is a recycle it&#39;s
come a long way and it still has a long
way to go
we have people can&#39;t expect the
government to do everything they just
can&#39;t they can&#39;t they need support and
social entrepreneurs provide that
support recyclers have been very
fortunate to have the support of the
Lego state government because they&#39;ve
been very instrumental in helping us
achieve our goals
social entrepreneurship has been the
most rewarding thing I&#39;ve ever done I
gave up a fancy job where I could have
made a lot of money for a life of
meaning social entrepreneurship is
infectious and I&#39;ve seen many people
going down that path because the real
how much they have to gain thank you
