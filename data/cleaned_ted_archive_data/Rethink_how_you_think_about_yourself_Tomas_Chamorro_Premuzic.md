so I grew up in Argentina which means I
always had a problem with confidence my
problem is I have too much of it and in
Argentina this is quite common we have
charming tendency to think that we are
the greatest country in the world even
though our nation has been declining for
about 100 years we are according to some
economic standards the only perpetually
devolving nation in the world and to
cope with this or maintain or delusion
we also have the highest concentration
of psychoanalysts per capita in the
world and if you don&#39;t want to spend
your life in therapy you can do what I
did which is you become a psychologist
yourself so I&#39;ve always been interested
in the relationship between confidence
how smart you think you are and
competence how smart you actually are
and for about 10 years I&#39;ve been
conducting studies relating people&#39;s
self perceived abilities with their
actual abilities not just in Argentina
but in about 40 different countries and
the surprising fact is that there is a
very weak relationship between
competence and confidence not because
most people are overly modest or
under-confident but because the vast
majority of people think they&#39;re better
than they actually are
so overconfidence is one of the most
pervasive biases in human thought and if
you read popular psychology textbooks or
are in to the self-help industry you
will know that there are two individual
advantages of being overconfident number
one it does feel good to think you&#39;re
great
even if you&#39;re deluded number two that
delusion can help you fool other people
and yet there is a dark side of
overconfidence that is hardly ever
emphasized for example overconfidence
explains why some people are much more
likely to have traffic accidents where
their drivers cyclists or pedestrians
why some people gamble and are into
compulsive pathological levels of
gambling and why we have financial
gambling cases and such as the last
Melton which are caused not just by
greedy investment bankers but also
overconfident consumers who overestimate
their ability to pay back their loans
and mortgages or wreak on fidence is
also behind major health threats so and
it explains why smokers drinkers drug
users illegal or legal and compulsive
eaters are in denial about their
addictions and overestimate their
ability to quit or underestimate the
potential harmful effects that these
addictions might have on them even when
they&#39;re aware of them they think it will
happen to other people not to themselves
and finally overconfidence also fosters
and promotes a narcissistic culture a
narcissistic society where we commonly
mistake confidence by competence which
is why in any domain or profession of
expertise there are so many charlatans
in business
why arrogant and psychopathic employees
are commonly promoted to managerial
levels why we have not enough women in
charge because there are more modest and
more under confidence yes
it&#39;s true it&#39;s a fact and also why so
many people especially teenagers are
obsessed with being famous just for the
sake of being famous and spent so much
time worshipping those who worship
themselves and why some of you might
spend so much time updating your
Facebook status hoping that others like
what you&#39;re doing and you know luckily
they can&#39;t dislike it they can only like
it so what&#39;s the solution and I want to
finish on a negative note which which
really is for your benefit and for our
benefit collect the benefit maybe it&#39;s
better to see the glass as half empty
and not enough has been said emphasizing
the positive power of negative thinking
there are key adaptational benefits to
your insecurities and to low confidence
for example low confidence is a threat
detection on detection signal that tells
you that you shouldn&#39;t be doing
something you know if you hear a little
inner voice that tells you you shouldn&#39;t
do something consider yourself lucky
maybe you should pay attention to it at
the same time the reason why so many
people suffer from having low
self-concept is because this signal is
emphasizing a discrepancy between the
person you want to be and the person you
think you are and so what you should do
about it
is try to reduce that discrepancy or
that gap between confidence and
competence by working hard not by
reading self-help books that tell you
that you shouldn&#39;t worry about your
self-esteem that you&#39;re great no matter
what other people think of you
and finally low confidence and
insecurities are key to keep us modest
humble and there are many advantages to
modesty it keeps us attentive to
negative feedback which means that we
are more coachable it also stops us from
being complacent and it also make us
makes us more likeable and this is
coming from a recovering Argentine so
the message is clear
a less confident world would be a better
world thank you very much
