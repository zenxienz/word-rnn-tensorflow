the first time I heard the word ignition
used in a
we profound way was in a very remote
African village 20 years ago my brother
Dave and I traveled to a place called
missile Molly village we went there to
live with the community and work with
them to build a school when we arrived
this is the school that they had about
150 kids attending only 12 of them girls
we sat down with the community we
explained if you&#39;re willing to do all
the labor contribute the labor to build
this school and if you&#39;re willing to
send your daughters to school and equal
numbers with your sons we can build a
new school they were all in we got busy
digging the foundation this guy Stephen
was on the work site every single day he
became my best friend in the village he
had my back all the time he also became
my mentor progress was going along
really well until my brother Dave
collapsed from malaria and almost died
eight days later I had 104-degree fever
I had malaria I went down I collapse
lost consciousness by the grace of God
my brother was able to drag me into one
of two hospitals that they had in the
country at the time when I came out of
it a couple of days later the doctor
looked at me and he said two more hours
away from this hospital and you would
have been dead luckily I was back on my
feet in about three or four days my
brother Dave had to come back to the
states to recover when I went back to
missile Molly village though I looked
around and I saw these community members
and I realized when they contract
malaria they do not have a near-death
experience they die why did I survive
and they don&#39;t extreme poverty they
don&#39;t have the twenty-dollar hospital
fee they don&#39;t have money for medicine
they don&#39;t have two bucks for a mosquito
net I was overwhelmed and I wanted to
get out of there but then I realized if
we could build this school then they
could break that cycle of extreme
poverty through education so I hung
round two weeks late or something
beautiful happen Stephens wife had their
first little baby first child Ruthie and
I held Ruthie in my arms I was enjoying
the moment until Stephen looked at me
and he said we&#39;re going to get that
school bill right man I was terrified
people around me were dying and I was
pretty sure that we weren&#39;t going to be
able to build that school the only thing
I was certain of was that Stephen was
never going to quit all this happened 20
years ago since then we have built more
than 500 schools around the world from
Haiti to Nepal to Malawi in three other
countries in Africa but did we get that
school built in missile Molly village we
did when I left the village or 150 kids
attending that new school but I was
lucky to get out of there with my life
so I never went back I was there not
long ago in Malawi with this team of
kids from the South Bronx I decided
after 20 years I needed to go and see
what happened to the community into that
school when I arrived I was devastated
our construction supervisor and his
entire family died from AIDS the chief
of the village when I was there he died
from AIDS I was paralyzed I couldn&#39;t
even walk but then the community came to
welcome me and lift me up and celebrate
but i can&#39;t find Stephen I&#39;m still
looking for Stephen I don&#39;t know what
happened to Stephen after half an hour I
realized that Stephen didn&#39;t make it
either and just as soon as my heart
started to sink he emerged from the
crowd smiling and alive I will never
forget what Stephen gave me in my moment
of fear he gave me the courage to keep
going I will never forget that right
after we met he led me to the center of
the ville
which I was stunned I was stunned
because I didn&#39;t know which school we
build instead of one school in 150 kids
there are five schools and a thousand
kids attending school every day 533 of
them are girls it&#39;s amazing but that I
had asked Steven about Ruthie&#39;s a little
baby where is Ruthie is she still with
us too many babies in Malawi don&#39;t
survive Steven smiled introduced me to
his beautiful 20 year old daughter and
then he was beaming with pride when he
explained that Ruthie attended that
school that we built she attended all
five of those schools and he lowered his
voice I could barely hear me it&#39;s
whispering she said you know I&#39;m an
illiterate man I can&#39;t even write my own
name but Russia became a teacher and she
will lift up my family&#39;s name forever
and then he looked at me and he used
that word he said you are the ignition
and I thought about that the definition
the act of starting a fire so an engine
begins to work I shook my head I look
back at Steven I said no you are the
ignition you lit that fire 20 years ago
and now Ruthie is the ignition an
education is a fire that nobody can
extinguish there are now eighty-one
thousand children parents and
grandparents attending these schools
every single day they built those
schools with their own hands they are
starting fires I learned from Steven
that if we are willing to confront our
fears if we have the courage to confront
our fears we can lead much bigger lives
so i invite you to decide what you&#39;re
passionate about confront your fears if
you&#39;ve got them and light a fire it is a
flame that nobody can put
thank you very much
