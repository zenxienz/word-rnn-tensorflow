ladies and gentlemen introducing Dinka
Dinka the captain that&#39;s about to take
African television by storm
me Bianca she be thinking in captain
Adrian scientists and she travels across
all of Africa with her friend
temple and together they use science to
save the day in the pilot episode we
follow Gingka and temple to a farm in
Uganda crops are dying there because
what are no day gingka this inca can we
fix it we can fix it shop shop you can
temple come construct better irrigation
system and just like that last day water
yay that&#39;s not all
stay tuned kids for next week&#39;s episode
good morning or afternoon people of Lake
up and thank you so much for having me
here today and for being here as well my
name is Madhubala&#39;s Madiba
I am a self-taught visual artist and in
my artistic practice I use themes of
games and play to describe social and
development concepts that interest me
and also within the Nigerian context I
should say that I consider myself to be
something of a lifelong learner this is
probably a title I&#39;ve taken a little too
literally because in the last decade or
so I&#39;ve received degrees in engineering
economics and education and about three
years ago
hahaha Nigeria I know and about three
years ago to the greatest shock of my
parents I left all of that to become a
full-time visual artist but it&#39;s in
three years and I think they&#39;re okay now
so they&#39;re fine now
back to you in kata thinker the animated
that I described earlier took place in
2012 it was the first month of my
graduate program at Harvard and as a
shop on Nigerian Gil
I was already pitching and looking for
an endorsement for my cartoon idea that
day I pitched these sketches that you
see here to my professor if there was
anyone who can land me my own TV deal it
was that guy this was my shot and so I
rounded off with the tagline
he would remember Dinka Dinka we can fix
it we can fix it then came time for his
feedback the professor started with a
compliment about young cows hair and to
his surprise my drawing ability then he
got really serious material ah let&#39;s
take the best-case scenario which is
that your show ends up being massively
successful and you inspire millions of
children to become scientists when they
grow older let me ask you something will
Nigeria in about 15 years or so have the
jobs to provide for young cows fans who
by then we&#39;ll be young adults and
turning into the workforce what are the
research institutions like with the
teachers and the policymakers supports
or acts against these efforts mmm I
guess I hadn&#39;t really thought of it that
way it turns out there are many other
players to consider in 2014
drawing from the professor&#39;s earlier
remarks I built a game installation
called the peoples algorithms well I&#39;m
constructing it here but I built the
game called the peoples algorithm to
illustrate the multi-faceted challenges
in the Nigerian education system the
game invites players to walk into a
larger-than-life rubik&#39;s cube as you see
here there&#39;s a monopoly like game on the
floor you pick a roll student teacher or
policymaker let me show you what happens
if you decide to play as a student this
was actually something that took place
in the car beer now that I went to last
May and this little girl helps me model
the game and you&#39;re about to see it
she&#39;s playing as a student so if you
pick a green dice you&#39;re playing as a
student if you pick a red one you&#39;re
playing as a teacher and if you pick a
blue dice you&#39;re playing as a
policymaker this little girl decided to
play as a student she throws the dice
right let&#39;s say she lands on a three so
she takes three steps and then there&#39;s a
massive coin above her head and she
spins that coin it&#39;s landed on heads
she&#39;s trying to get into university
she&#39;s had to take the job in exam three
times and she&#39;s failed for three
consecutive years
I&#39;m sure anybody here who has been
through the education system probably
has watched or actually even experienced
these challenges so the game tells her
to take three steps back okay and which
represents really in life and in the
game a big delay in the young girl&#39;s
life so she rolls the game again and
this time she lands on an intervention
category and in this category the game
is prompting her the game is prompting
her to provide a solution to one of the
questions that I&#39;m asking the question
that I&#39;m asking is that there are 11.5
million young children that are not in
primary school and they&#39;re supposed to
be in primary school how do we get them
in so she has a choice of a B C or D I
will tell you what the options are but
she just has to choose and then she
rolls the dice and continues now this
all looks like child&#39;s play but we are
actually while we&#39;re playing this game
gambling with the fate of our nation the
people&#39;s algorithm became the subject of
homework assignments when it was
exhibited at the Dakar BIA now for
contemporary art last May in Senegal
miss how does your game solve problems
of Education in Nigeria a young girl
asks other kids scratch their heads
unsatisfied that my game does not
provide a clear route to win so how do
we win that&#39;s the big question but my
game provides choices not answers you
know I&#39;ll be the first to admit that my
game probably sounds a tad bit
depressing and so in my recent works I&#39;m
doing something that looks a little bit
more hopeful led by the desire to see
all of us parents teachers students
policymakers alike working together
I&#39;m currently painting these
synchronized swimmers in the paintings
each person here is playing their parts
to the benefit of a structured system
it&#39;s beautiful
and it makes me smile it&#39;s by no means
easy and so I&#39;ve burnt little holes as
you can see the black holes I actually
burn this with fire to depict
the swimmers struggle and also
their resilience and like I said I do
burn these on purpose and I say this to
clarify because I traveled out of the
country once with my with my burnt
paperwork&#39;s and one of the customs
officials at Abuja took them out and
looked at them and to his utter
bewilderment says ah I see fire catch
your walk yes on purpose so I have to
get this picture I was like no one&#39;s
gonna believe me if I tell them this
story it did happen and this is because
you know the customs officials doing
their job at the airport so needless to
say I never did get that TV deal but I
often think of gin cos the thinker and
my youthful optimism is renewed as I
continue to work on my synchronized
swimmers I&#39;m reminded that these figures
here working together dispel the myths
that black people can&#39;t swim it allows
me to imagine new possibilities to
structure an education system that
creates hopefully for Nigeria future
winners at its core I do believe that
that is the power of art good people of
Lagos keep swimming and let us play we
can fix it we can fix it thank you
[Applause]
