god I&#39;ve done something to my ear thing
where&#39;s the ear guy I&#39;m here it is okay
here I am oh okay um I love coming here
and it&#39;s always such a huge experience
when I come and I feel so lucky that I
get to do this um but this is basically
my experience at Ted and it happens
every time I&#39;m listening to a talk and I
get so overwhelmed by what the speakers
talking about and I feel so caught up in
the passion that he or she is talking
about and then they&#39;re describing how
they got caught up and their passion and
it&#39;s transferring to me and I realize
that our brains are in sync and I&#39;m
getting all you know verklempt and I
think I&#39;m gonna cry and then I think I
have to stop everything I&#39;m doing and
get involved with this person&#39;s passion
and my life has changed and just how
they&#39;re telling me how their life was
James now my life has changed and this
is the greatest thing ever and then at
the end I jump to my feet and I clap and
I wipe away a tear and then literally
three hours later I&#39;m in the lunch line
and I&#39;m thinking now who&#39;s that guy
he&#39;s the one guy and then my husband
will say that&#39;s the barbershop doctor
guy or that&#39;s the global citizen
anti-poverty guy and I go yeah well that
was the morning session and it&#39;s there&#39;s
something that&#39;s so horrible about it I
don&#39;t know what their well the way to
solve it I mean because I think we
probably all feel the same way and it&#39;s
not like I feel like we can only really
we&#39;ve just got to be a month long and we
just have one talk a day and then just
go lay in the fetal position or
something right because it&#39;s too much
it&#39;s such a roller coaster
okay then the other thing is when we got
here it wasn&#39;t immediately often obvious
where the gift basket because work and
my husband said so I wonder what&#39;s in
the gift basket and I was like oh I am
sure that Ted has realized that people
don&#39;t want stuff anymore I mean people
are over stuff we&#39;re all trying to
minimalize our live we&#39;re all trying to
not care about things and finally I
think it was kind of going that way ted
has realized that we just don&#39;t want a
big bag of stuff because that&#39;s just
another bag of stuff in the world and I
don&#39;t want it and then like one second
later this moon comes up and said here&#39;s
your gift basin we were like God what we
went in the room we got to pick it was
so exciting and I couldn&#39;t believe how
quickly I was going oh I want that I
only get to pick one
at the idea that you know we people pay
a lot of money to come here the
excitement over the $200 apples gives
certificates it was like I can make it
back
that can&#39;t be a lot of money to you but
I do was going to underdogs I had
ordered my shoes by the end of that day
and they were delivered the next day at
my home my mother told me and I loved it
okay so let&#39;s just go through the
conference a few things that I thought
about okay so this the conference
started out okay so the 10 year old
Indian girl came out and I thought oh my
god she is so cute she is so cute she is
too cute and then she was saying these
wonderful things and she was so perfect
she was really perfect she was too
perfect and then I thought oh my god
this is the TEDx prize artificial
intelligence winner she is a robot
we are the Turing test and I see through
it then I saw her around later she seems
quite nice okay um okay Ben Astro teller
I don&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t explain his
name right away I like I could barely
hear what he was saying like Astro
teller Astro teller like what&#39;s he
predestined to be the head of Google X
or I mean it sounds like a like a
Bitcoin cash dispenser or something like
he&#39;s like Astro teller what a great name
okay
okay so first one we&#39;re seeing the big
balloons in the air I thought they were
like huge condoms that were gonna be
flying through the air drying but then I
I thought you know to deliver maybe
condoms to the people of Mongolia or
something like I was sort of confused in
person and I was like oh no it&#39;s just so
that they can deliver the Internet to
faraway places like Mongolia so they can
download porn because we now back to the
world needs okay and I&#39;m a little
worried I just hope the air traffic
controller are not on strike still I&#39;m a
little out of date what&#39;s in news
because there&#39;s gonna be so many things
flying in the stratosphere there the
dirigible he&#39;s come up with that are
gonna have the wind machines
I was frightening okay oh the air B&amp;B
guy you guys I&#39;m I love how a guy who
had a mysterious night with a sexy
strange man who was going off to the
Peace Corps that the experience was so
profound and maybe embarrassing he had
to explain it all by creating a 1
billion dollar company
how can I explain this
oh my god I just want to say on the side
I stayed in eight but Airbnb is I&#39;m so
excited about Airbnb and I do love
Airbnb I think it&#39;s really
transformative like over is I really
think it&#39;s a huge game-changer
I stayed at eight in 2013 over a
six-month period from a tree house in
Hawaii to I I went crazy on Airbnb I
couldn&#39;t get off air B&amp;B so I did these
eight places to stay the most wild one
was that um tree house in Hawaii which I
realized there are other beings that
love treehouses bugs it was filled with
bugs but that was okay um and I but I
did love it I love the whole Airbnb
thing I met all these people and in the
end I the real results that I just
realized how much I love hotels I front
desk and someone different there in the
morning oh okay
baby all right okay now oh I&#39;ve just
written these notes skinny world poverty
guy okay that guy what&#39;s one of the guys
that I got so upset I loved his vision
and I loved that he had such a concrete
way of dealing with the poverty and when
he started husband leave over and said
he looks hungry I thought oh my god I
love this guy so much and I&#39;m so happy
that he is so thin as we should all be
but I was really he was then because I
thought oh my god when he was in that
hunt and they were passing out those
those cups of porridge if it was a
really heavy person it would have been
so much worse than that
oh my god who does me I feel like oh I&#39;m
going to die now okay so I just that&#39;s
oh that&#39;s my bit for that I just loved
that he&#39;s skinny okay okay oh yeah the
guy oh oh
ooh BRR okay I thought he was gonna tell
us the true story of why they had to
change the logo because I suspect that
that big you mean something like I want
to fuck your mother an Indonesian or
something like that and people were
driving around there&#39;s more to that logo
change story
okay um oh and then that lovely guy last
night who came up and started his little
talk and then he sat down and we stood
up and then he didn&#39;t had a meltdown and
I felt so bad for him because I have so
been there but I can think we can help
them because that neuroscientist who
works with PTSD is here in the house and
then have calming lavender sent over em
okay I must go for this type but I was
so in love with linus torvalds
i love him so much and he helped my
marriage a million percent this week
that&#39;s probably the greatest takeaway of
the week because when I met my husband
and he showed me a picture of his office
it looked the same way and I was like
how can you not have a picture up like
how can you not have anything and so
when he showed his office I was nudging
my husband saying oh my god that&#39;s like
you and I thought he&#39;d might tell a
story about how he started out so sad
and playing and then we were gonna see
the after no he thing he took away the
walking desk the one thing in that
office that was sort of interesting he
took away um but I loved it and every oh
you know what I loved about him is that
he just really knew so much about him
itself and he created this job that was
right for his personality and it really
helped me of my marriage because I am
more the visionary type I&#39;m like my
husband doesn&#39;t even want to talk about
like a summer driving trip like okay
where should we go in the summer and
he&#39;s like this drawer doesn&#39;t pull out
right and then he&#39;s all about the
pothole when they&#39;re all in front of him
and it really it drives me so crazy I
just want to kill him half the time but
now no because of Linus so thank you if
you&#39;re still here okay
the astronomer oh the alien civilization
and astronomer wasn&#39;t that so wild okay
this is what I thought instead of them
thinking that might be big solar panels
in the sky over that planet what if it&#39;s
just big advertisements we don&#39;t know
what that civilization is right maybe
the key to developing an advanced
civilization is really just down to
advertising and it&#39;s just the entire sky
now okay I&#39;m going on all right
um oh my god the virtual reality thing I
thought was so incredible I loved it so
much actually I was we were one of the
people who got the New York Times thing
and my husband Oh so Madison thing when
that came in the mail in the New York
Times you didn&#39;t think it was so great I
watched all those before and I was like
I know I guess I had to be in the room I
had to be with all of us watching that
virtual reality but it really was so
fantastic and then what was so disarming
was that woman at the end it was so
close and she was so much closer than
you would ever be to somebody that you
didn&#39;t know and it was so um unnerving
and then it was you could just really
look at her and I thought oh my god the
porn industry is gonna go through the
biggest boom
maybe not funny but it&#39;s true just watch
I&#39;m saying that okay now I kept thinking
okay we had shonda rhimes here and
norman lear these big TV producers I
feel like the procrastinator guys should
have we should make a TV show come on
we&#39;ve got the talent here in the room
the procrastinator and the
procrastinator is that what he called
himself I feel like I&#39;m sort of a semi
procrastinator I&#39;m in the middle of it
but I could see them having a show
together and they could have to live
together and you could have funny things
or they&#39;re saying let&#39;s clean the living
room no I need to think about it a
little more oh and then that made me
think of the real TV show I want to
pitch to you guys it&#39;s me the copy
editor of The New Yorker lady and the
design lady with the great Louise Brooks
haircut in the fantastic dress and we&#39;re
like the Golden Girls and we&#39;re in New
York and we all live together and we
only have people from Ted come over to
our house so Mike we&#39;d be getting ready
for a party or we could have little
arguments about our names on the address
I would put commas between our aim and
then the copy editor woman to take know
it has to be semicolons and then the
design lady would say no it&#39;s gotta be
slashes because that looks so much
better and then we went through a party
and that doctor little the science and
personality guy would come over and we&#39;d
say there&#39;s about to be a party and he&#39;d
say no I&#39;m an introvert I&#39;m an introvert
and then we&#39;d have to go put him in the
back room and then maybe the French
mathematician with the beautiful cravat
and the mysterious spider pin which he
told me he does not divulge why he wears
it
he comes over and we have little
discussions of why he wears that spider
pin maybe it&#39;s because he snares women
with his mesmerizing gaze and then kills
them or something I don&#39;t know
and then maybe John McWhorter the
language guy comes over and he&#39;s telling
us more about how great it is to learn
languages because of how it feels in
your mouth to say the words which oh I
love that so much and then we could have
like body ever I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;d
like rolling around in my mouth
some jokes like that okay and the chess
woman could come over and oh this is my
favorite line of all Ted to give
checkmate is always fun oh my god
and we make we have a lot of laughs with
her and then finally we find her in the
back bedroom actually having sex with a
check and we realize when she comes out
I never have sex with Slovakian never
come on I come from sitcoms people all
right then the vegetable guy comes out
of the kitchen with a bunch of clarinets
made of our carrots that we were trying
to sell then okay maybe this is bad but
I feel like the guy who loves free
market capitalism from the conservative
think tank rings a doorbell and we all
go everybody be quiet okay that&#39;s how I
have people but I love being here thank
you so much
thank you thank you Superman for helping
me thank you
