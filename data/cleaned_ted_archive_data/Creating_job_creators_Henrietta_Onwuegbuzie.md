we all say entrepreneurship is the
engine of economic growth for both
developing and developed countries yet
75 to 80 percent of those who graduate
for my educational institutions
feel as startups and another 8% of the
of the ones who survive feel after the
first three years if they survive the
first three years every year thousands
of graduates enter the job market and
can&#39;t find jobs yet and in addition to
this our society has not only increasing
youth unemployment which is aggravated
by technology which helps more people do
more in less time but also we have a
situation where we have rising poverty
even when there&#39;s economic growth
because we practice what I term
predatory capitalism where we all focus
on how to make more for ourselves and
everyone else what about the context our
created environments now in spite of
these problems which are destroying our
society we find ourselves in
institutions that focus on job
eligibility in other words program
students in with a job-seeking mentality
when we should be producing job creators
who are providing solutions to improve
society and for this reason I choose to
develop not just entrepreneurs but
entrepreneurs I referred to as impact
driven entrepreneurs entrepreneurs who
make money from solving problems and as
a result are able to change society so
they are for-profit to the social
purpose these are the entrepreneurs who
are the true engines of growth in any
economy these are the sort of
entrepreneurs Africa and indeed the rest
of the world need needs in addition to
this research has shown that
entrepreneurs who seek to make impacts
beside beyond financial returns also
make more money than those who just
focus on making money from doing
business
to illustrate this I&#39;m going to share
two examples from my MBA classes
this is oka a students who in 2013
started
Nigeria&#39;s only online retail furniture
store
I usually also teach them that you don&#39;t
need a lot of money to start a business
so I give them on purpose very little
capital and I say to them no matter how
much you have you add nothing to it $30
which then was 5000 naira and Bucca I
didn&#39;t even use the five thousand lire
he used what he had he could develop a
website he could develop websites so he
develops one for roadside artisans who
would otherwise depend on working
customers to buy from them at very low
prices now with his platform he created
access to wider market for these
roadside artisans who make good very
good quality furniture so that people
like you and I from the comfort of our
offices can actually find good furniture
at more affordable prices and get them
delivered to us you didn&#39;t have to pay
online when he started you could pay on
delivery and today he serves customers
not just in Lagos but all over Nigeria
and his biggest customer segment happens
to be Nigerians in the Diaspora who are
building at home and before would have
to depend on brothers or sisters or
relatives to help them buy the furniture
to furnish the homes they&#39;re building
back home now hooker today makes well
over six hundred thousand dollars which
is 120 million naira if you use the
rates the exchange rates when he started
and I think he&#39;s putting much more money
than any of his classmates who got cushy
jobs in fancy firms when they finished
from the NBA those are pictures of some
other artisans he helped many of whom
today the way apprentice when he started
but today are now full-blown owners of
carpentry furniture workshops and are
also employing others so over 60 people
have been pulled out of poverty since
oka started because as the man grows he
engages more people and these people
also earn enough my second example is
high wall so I wall started a business
tag
impact stifled initiative which was
meant to impact 500 people again
remember all she had was 5000 iron which
forces them to be very creative and so
the first thing she did was buying some
accessories to grow the amount of money
and then she got enough materials so I
Nabal her train five girls she went to
the public school and spoke to the
teachers asking for five most indigent
students who she could train and empower
to make accessories using local fabric
today she supplies well-known stores
like Terra culture with these lovely
accessories and those girls can now
continue the education in school because
they have a means of livelihood they
supply for her and they also make the
same supplies for other people and earn
money from doing this these accessories
are also being exported abroad and so we
have high wall with just 5,000 naira
impacting many lives these girls were
actually on the verge of leaving school
because their parents couldn&#39;t afford to
keep them in school and today they&#39;re
breadwinners for the entire family and
so I&#39;d like to end by saying it&#39;s not so
difficult to achieve prosperity if we
are able to develop entrepreneurs who
solve problems or meet needs using
profitable business models who create
wealth or create shared prosperity and
will create a better society and a
better world thank you
you
