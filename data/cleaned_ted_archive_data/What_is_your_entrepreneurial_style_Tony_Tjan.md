entrepreneurship for traits and one
truth let me start with a question
what really drives you more important
than any other quality the
self-awareness that allows us stance
this question this self-awareness that
allows us to better understand our
motivations our biases why we succeed
and why we fail if I had one Ted wish it
would be that me we the world could be
more self-aware now there are many ways
to become more self-aware you can
journal you can ask friends for feedback
but you can also become more self-aware
through the power and language of a
framework and today I&#39;m here to share an
entrepreneur know thyself framework
around self-awareness and it cuts across
these four traits first heart second
smarts guts and then luck now before
going in defining each of those traits
let me just spend a minute explaining
how we arrived at this philosophy over
the past three years my colleagues have
traveled around to have conversations
and interviews with hundreds of
entrepreneurs some of you are here in
the audience with those interviews were
able to develop a more formalized
entrepreneurial aptitude test it&#39;s sort
of myers-briggs of entrepreneurship or
what we call e now in this test we ask a
series of trade-off questions is your
success driven more by your brilliance
or your boldness your passion or people
skills and in each case you see there&#39;s
no one right or wrong choice you are
forced to make a trade-off between two
great answers all of you can try a
sample of this test at hsg Elcom or in
our book park smarts guts and luck it
only takes about five minutes now what
did we find we found first and foremost
there is no one singular recipe for
entrepreneurial success people want a
recipe people want to connect the dots
strategy people want a cookbook a
playbook but there is no one
your answer instead people have a
baseline across all four traits of heart
smarts guts and luck you do need a
threshold level but what&#39;s most
important and tying it back to that
concept of self-awareness is that all of
us tend to be driven by one or two
dominant drivers now many of you out
there especially in this audience I&#39;m
sure is saying no no no I am dominant
across all four I&#39;m going to take your
test and prove you wrong I am heart
driven I&#39;m smart sure but I&#39;m guts
trumpet and I also have luck well if you
get that off your survey please come see
me and bring your purple unicorn with
you so which one are you I&#39;m going to
define each and think on a relative
basis to your peers which of these
traits resonates most with you let&#39;s
begin with heart zero Dreams of Sushi
who&#39;s seen this film an incredible movie
if you haven&#39;t and you get nothing else
out of Ted you or my talk today write
down that movie jiro Dreams of Sushi
I&#39;ll give you that as a great
recommendation what zero does what zero
does is he exemplifies the heart driven
entrepreneur founder the heart driven
entrepreneur founder and by the way
winner in our survey we found that 65%
of these founders were heart dominant
they have three underlying elements
first purpose and passion in the case of
Jareau a singular unwavering commitment
towards that pursuit of perfection in
sushi that calling allows for the
concept of agape what the greeks called
a sacrificial type of love the
relationship that&#39;s like a maternal
instinct of an entrepreneur founder with
his or her child which is their venture
and that agape together with that
purpose and passion leads to nuance a
clear distinction between entrepreneurs
who are really good and those that are
exceptional is the ability to express
nuance those that have seen the movie
Jiro have remembered the scenes of him
massaging the octopus for 30 minutes
as he preps it the delivery of sushi at
exactly body temperature the hand
toasting of seaweed Fanning over open
charcoal flames these types of
entrepreneurs these Jarosz of the world
these are entrepreneurs who are the
wives of the world not the what and it&#39;s
because they are heart driven and they
have why we found something fairly
remarkable out of our sample base who
have now we have thousands of people who
have taken us on from lab to test is
that seventy percent of businesses that
have had a successful exit or IPO did
not start with a formal business plan
they started with that place we call
hard now what about smarts though we
have an audience here that has a
multiplicity of degrees and we build GPA
track records smarts is so much more
than book IQ smarts of course book IQ
can help but in and of itself it is
neither necessary nor sufficient the
type of smarts that really matters are
those that can see the big picture those
people that can look at the everyday
ordinay the snail and find a Fibonacci
miss nale those that can see a seemingly
unrelated constellation of things and
find a constellation of meaning smarts
is ultimately about pattern recognition
contextualized intelligence are you
smart driven now let&#39;s go to guts those
of you who are guts driven you are the
action-oriented you are the doers you&#39;re
in that rare category of about 12 to 15%
of our survey population that has more
Dunn&#39;s than two deuce
now guts is manifested in two ways in
the Sprint and in the marathon the
Sprint is about that moment of truth
where you have the guts to initiate your
arm gets stuck in a mountain what are
you going to do in that moment of truth
and the second way guts manifests itself
is overtime entrepreneurship is a
marathon do you have the persistence the
resilience the endurance to last and
ultimately when you do and you succeed
do you have the guts to evolve now let&#39;s
do that fourth quality luck most of us
think of luck as something that&#39;s
fatalistic a byproduct of chance heads
or tails
a 50-50 percent probability of being
right
that&#39;s all luck is but luck is something
much more we have all heard the phrase
people make their own luck people create
their own luck but what does that really
mean and how do you do it three ways 25%
of those in our sample base were luck
domina it was a very surprising finding
that we had and what they had in common
were these three qualities more so than
anything humility I by the way was not
luck dominant humility this was a
population subpopulation in our sample
that really understood limitations and
believed that they did not know very
much that most things that they do is
the result of others and a higher fire
belief system luck is much more about an
attitude what we call a lucky attitude
just much more about a viewpoint and
disposition on yourself and on the
relationships you have
it starts with humility humility allows
you to have intellectual curiosity this
voracious appetite to experience what&#39;s
new and novel and also an intellectual
curiosity that makes you more of a
question asker than someone trying to
always answer the question and finally
optimism this third trait is the energy
that realizes the lucky attitude and
that optimism goes like this it&#39;s when
someone next tells you an idea see if
you can wait to think about every reason
why it might work before allowing a
single thought in your mind why it won&#39;t
work this characterizes the luck
dominant entrepreneur now why care why
care if your heart driven smart driven
guts driven or luck driven for reasons
no your superpower strength versus your
kryptonite second your decision-making
biases by knowing your biases you know
your weakness third future speed bumps
the heart driven entrepreneur is going
to have a different issue at the scale
up point then a smarts got the person
and vice versa and last team selection
find a complement of folks not people
just like you but those four factors
pale in relation to the one truth I want
to leave you with and that one truth is
this it is that self-awareness is the
foundation for everything but it gives
us the potential for what we call self
congruence and self congruent is when
you are in that state where you are
living in the truest expression of who
you are and it&#39;s when you are in that
state when you do what you say when you
say what you think when you think what
you feel how you feel is who you are
thank you
