hi everybody my name is Ali Kanta
I&#39;m born in a Gambia Gambia is a small
little country in West Africa probably
one of the smallest country in the
continent
I came to Congo about 25 years ago and I
married in Congo and half my kids India
fear at that time is called the year
during the leadership of the famous
president called Mobutu Sese Seko I&#39;ve
been doing business in Congo of the year
which is mainly trading I buy coffee in
Congo process it I have two factories in
the east and Kinshasa export it to
London and I fly to London
flew to London and traded in the market
bought robusta and Arabica years after
then there is another civil war came in
Congo before the father Kabila came in
was a very difficult time the economic
was just going down and nobody have
interests beside the major mining
companies which is the Belgium group and
Congolese group called jakkuman
during the war I&#39;m going to show you the
country for so you can see the Imai the
country for the how big the country is
about 60 million this is the last census
date Tecla year before the election
which I personally believe Congo today
should be around 75 million people
because some of the rural area I don&#39;t
think the guys they can discern sirs
money to get to them down Congo is the
third biggest country in Africa after
Sudan and Algeria it has the 60%
forestry reserve of the continent and
second after Amazon
in Brazil you can see where Kinshasa is
and the back hongo which is next to DC
point and Lumumba she Katanga region
where I mean the mineral capital I would
say was one of the biggest deposit of
gold copper and so on in this country
when the father kabila came to power
after so many years of civil war in
Congo there was only about 10,000
fixed-line in DRC sorry 15,000
fixed-line in DRC and 10,000 analog
which was built by a US company with
some Congolese and US partnership
entrepreneur during those days you have
only probably Mobutu&#39;s bodyguard the
ministers and wealthy business people
foreign exchange you can see the
currency there was not trust in the
banking system during those time because
when you put your money deposit in the
bank you could not withdraw because when
you need since you have $10 in the bank
and you make a check you go to the bank
they cannot pay you so you have a trade
on the side that will give you maybe $5
and take your check and manage it some
somehow he has the most beautiful
country you can see the Congo River
the fishermen doing the fishing around
this area this is where this is the
rural Airport because we have about four
airport in the country there is no
infrastructure like Road no railroad
only between Kansas and Matadi and
mainly
those are the main cargo from upside the
world coming through Matadi we do have
during a fantasy partner with Rwanda or
you have had things coming through
Tanzania across Uganda Rwanda come to
Kinshasa so and also Tanganyika River
the goose come to to Congo so I&#39;m going
to talk about my venture which is my
company called Congolese wireless
network we&#39;ve previewed a CW when father
Kabila took over the Congo his fall
speak to the nation he said to build the
infrastructure the law and order legal
system in the country in order to
attract outside investors and
communication telecommunication two days
after that speech I call a friend of
mine to axe him do you know the minister
of telecom he said yes and here&#39;s a
banker today&#39;s in the u.s. living there
he said yes I come from the same state
with him and it took me to introduce me
to the minister and I met his Excellency
and we have a chart about
telecommunication in the country and I
asked him the procedure hard to get the
license that I would like to have a life
in in Congo for telecom well here is I
have no experience no pyro information
before on telecommunication but as a
businessman I see you need only not for
my business but the millions of
Congolese for communication outside I
see it sometime I go to the post office
I will stay for five hour just waiting
to call somebody out of the country
to past the connection they&#39;ve been down
there people go and sleep in front of
the post office in order to get
telephone connection so the minister
listen to me after the meeting and I
left and he walked me to the door he
said to me mr. Conti do you know to
build a network it&#39;s lot of money but I
didn&#39;t have the idea and I asked him
your excellency if the government award
middle Eisen
I will build a network and from there on
I went through colorful accent do you
have or know anybody who in be telecom
industry or defenders he was in u.s. he
said to me yes I do a front end banner
who live in Paris I have to put a
feasibility study for the government I
called these gentlemen and talked to him
about my project and he said that he&#39;s
interested and two three days after he
flew to Kinshasa and join me and I
called the minister we went to meet the
minister and he asked several fractions
to get the data of Congo did
telecommunication teledensity in the
country we went to the Central Bank
chair he get chance to meet the governor
of central bank who was a former city
banker which was a big help for us and
give him all the details and the
information so from there on he flew
back to Paris and came with the proposal
three less than three week presented
government after the ministerial meeting
the minister called me to deposit
hundred thousand that they approved my
application then there will be two gsm
network in the country so we paid a
hundred thousand now I am expected to
get a GSM license
three weeks after he called me he said
no you have to pay additional two
hundred thousand a month also he said
you have to put eight million dollar
fertilizing then I went to the minister
I said to him please look the country&#39;s
in a war and no one gonna paid ten
million he said what will be the best
price I say go back to the cabinet and
give my proposal two million fertilising
finally the government agreed to a
million and give me one year to build
the network all over the country I
couldn&#39;t raise thumps everywhere I go
from I have C major political insurance
corporation Belcher
do you name it we couldn&#39;t get no
funding here as times go on I have to
meet the deadline and I went back to the
minister to extend the deadline to give
us more time and which he was very
helpful to do so when that I get that
deadline I went back to Nortel this and
that work cannot sell he said that there
is a system called pick a node which
will cost you two million because every
vendor need 110 percent guarantee for
Congo no insurance no banks even the
locals don&#39;t want to invest in the
country here I flew to Paris
amid the president of the not-self with
my lawyer we decide to go with Moshe
but saying so I have to cooperate a
company in the United State in Delaware
by my lawyer called African Wireless and
have 60% of my company to be owned by
African Wireless so that it be much
easier for me to raise funding
and with him we have few people
afterward when I made did not tell guys
mid with them in Paris they can give me
this four thousand subscriber a network
to be built with five cell side and they
need mic deposit in cash total amount is
- they need 1.5 was the only saving I
have and I asked my wife he say go for
it and I filthy Perry and I gave the
check 1.5 million to defy them of
not-self
and signing that contract was a big
party just like number of people here
and the president when we sign he took a
glass of champagne
I said no I&#39;ll take what because I&#39;ll
take some pain the day that we do the
narration I&#39;m going to show it
integration briefly here sorry
denigration will completely on my name
that the underlayment of my colleague I
take this opportunity to thank you and
welcome you here today for the opening
of our network songul is valid network
beautiful gsm network in Republic
Democratic ensemble
okay I&#39;m gonna go briefly the time don&#39;t
let me so this was the first opening GSM
in Congo it was 4,000 the capacity if I
do 2,000 I get good quality but the day
we like we have 35,000 people line up to
get phone and we were selling that phone
for for 350 dollars
we have no billing no criticism no
satellite link nothing so doing so the
drama now to raise funding for Congo I
have moved all over the world trying to
look F major government in Western
Europe South African government
everywhere in Congo as outside was
impossible to raise funds nor shall
finally see that there is a huge
potential what they can do to give me a
switch that will take about 20,000
that&#39;s which you did install it we have
35,000 connected then we look for the
prepaid billing satellite link in u.s.
when we bought these satellite links and
a prepaid machine nobody would like to
leave massachusett to come to Congo
because the State Department bound it
traveling to Congo
we finally gradually things change we
get guys coming to Congo and we put the
prepaid system in DRC we launched the
false GSM network which you have seen
down from there on after 2 years we&#39;re
struggling and have the personal
sacrifice on salaries because I couldn&#39;t
pay them but one thing what I told them
this company don&#39;t belong to me
it belong to all of us I might not be
able to paid you today and let&#39;s work
out something
BBD who is sitting among you guys here
what cut with the personnel they take 25
percent salary 75 we went till whenever
we can make it so doing so we build the
network together in those days --is
after years and years the war start in
Congo all over the place and the war
came back they have the four governments
for five different political parties
those for political parties become for
vice-president and making as millennium
two years after that
Vodacom and many other networks contact
me and join a partnership deal in Congo
from 30000 when we joined with Vodacom
estimate my company with 30,000
subscriber was about 75 million dollar
we take maybe about I took about 10
million to pay other local expensive
personnel the rest to inject in the
company as my capital and change the
infrastructure name to Vodacom Congo
I returned 49% and water come have 51%
yes and you know you told us some some
amazing stories on the on the phone
about the rollout in some of the areas
of Congo affected by the war and I want
to make sure you have time to get to
that because that&#39;s an amazing yeah
amazing thing you did yes for challenge
rolling this out yes we we have to take
initiative to open della between the
government and the five rebel group in
the country one one sir we launched in
Congo the population want to call other
part of the cities or a part of the
country was impossible so what we did to
talk to the government so that we be
able to talk to the rebel leaders which
we did we met some of them in South
Africa through to the
different channel they agreed they said
you have to pedal Isen we said now we
have only one license that we paid with
the government finally the first one
allowed us was Gomer when we put the
sell-side in Goma then jean-pierre Bemba
the one you here recently call us in
this not part we built we went there we
put silk sell cider so all the for rebel
invite us to put network to extend the
capacity there so the population the
government the rebel we all start to
speak to each other so I think a DSM in
India tea have changed dynamic our
presence and what we have did there have
opened the way all over and the
president today use that as an
instrument to go to track investors
outside that if you see what water come
did in Congo why not you come into coma
so when I thought it the teledensity was
almost as I said 20,000 today a country
of 60 million we have about 6 million
subscribers my network have 3 million
subscribers and we are connecting our
network connecting 1.5 to 2 million a
year not going and iam others investors
and companies that turned you down
what&#39;s the estimated value now of this
company of those well well it is as I
said I have old friends in us who joined
with me they want to exit because of
their age
the company was estimated not about
Montego about 1.6 1.7 billion net and
which is 500 US dollar net for subscribe
you
