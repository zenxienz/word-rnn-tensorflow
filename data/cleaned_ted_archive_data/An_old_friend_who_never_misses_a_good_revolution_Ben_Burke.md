oh hello fellows and friends are you all
enjoying your very special day I
certainly hope so because if you&#39;re not
there&#39;s probably something wrong with
you and you should get that checked out
I did and I&#39;m so much better for it so
I&#39;m going to take this moment right now
time this very specified preordained
amount of time to talk about an old
friend certainly an old friend of mine
from way back a friend of all of ours a
destructive friend admittedly deservedly
I&#39;d be the first to admit and yet
there&#39;s just something about them you
know so this calls for some Colin
response I need your help very short oh
good you&#39;re enthused one word I&#39;ll say
it once each time and then we&#39;ll all say
it together this poem is called old
friend or it could be called ode to
Jeremy England the MIT kids or could be
called the golden hammer and the
revolutions toolbox but probably not how
about old friend who never misses a good
revolution
what keeps the whole world spinning what
fills the trees up with trimmings what
keeps the darkness from winning 55 who&#39;s
the angel with a sword and it&#39;s half the
demon that deftly turn sand into crystal
what roars and then whistles flows
through the heart of every woman and man
I from the far reaches of space to the
palm of your hand from the center of
heavens own system to the place where
you currently stand itself down from the
sky it gives shape to the land you can&#39;t
look at in the eyes and yet it&#39;s where
all things began fine yes fire takes a
thing that&#39;s gone solid a thing that is
sleeping settled in forum it breaks it
apart freeze up its elements released to
the skies and a storm of delight sends
them back into the world and makes the
morning from the night takes the world
as it is then breaks a molecule like a
twig turning rocks into liquid the
liquids the gases make spirits of all
things turns tears into laughter what
came before what will follow us after
we&#39;re gone what keeps us huddled
together as time marches on fire by
now it can take many forms such as anger
or briefs it can burn down the whole
forest just to turn over a new leaf it
can mean what you can&#39;t say and breathe
life where words fail it can bathe the
world and cover when the face of the
land grows pale so for those who float
upon the wind those curled up in the
dark of night those who&#39;ve lost
themselves and tunnels those held back
yet cannot fight what will fuse these
beings together take a world of wrong
and make it right looking forwards one
brilliant thing for many make them all
hold each other tight what is taught
this time and time again we all deserve
to be burning bright Phi Phi ah thank
you
[Applause]
