this is a Edward Edwards going to help
me tell this story aren&#39;t you little guy
that&#39;s right
so yeah winging it
I kind of live for winging it something
I&#39;ve been really kind of hit me just the
other day it&#39;s happening right now which
is exciting
um flying by the seat of your pants I
I realize I live for those moments
though I&#39;ve also prepared for today you
know Tom but I&#39;m a showman of various
kinds of all kinds of shows in all kinds
of places this is a new one I&#39;m always
trying to find a way to make the
unexpected happen in the show and I kind
of came about that through working with
trash which is my other great love
something I do on my own kind of a
meditative thing these are some of my
orphans made of orphans from my home for
creepy things everybody needs a place in
this world this is Sally I also have a
puppet troupe so I got tired of doing it
so I&#39;m making things that do it for me
so surprises even just little ones
inside this guy little bird in there
he&#39;s cute
inside this one I like so like peep
shows things that move but all through
working with what I&#39;ve got
I always need something to to start with
I like I like problems and I like
solving them and I like you know making
just even a little bit of magic happen
with something I like to lead like to
show how how that got to happen even
when I&#39;m doing shows it&#39;s always like
putting on the show is part of the show
so working with what you got with trash
is also a way that I co-founded the
theater company stars and garters feeder
company good-looking group
me and my friend Jenny joke Kristen were
just writing a show started very simple
we had 12 poems about the constellations
and no auditions we just had friends
would come up and say you know hey you
guys write in the show I want to be in
it okay then some would say but I&#39;m not
a performer I don&#39;t act you know we&#39;d
say well all right we always got this
sexy librarian thing going on and some
pretty tough to beat and we&#39;ll just
write in a sexy librarian character
looks perfect
you&#39;ll be the ship librarian that&#39;s
hilarious
oh you could be the narrator that&#39;s
perfect you know and then someone else
would come up and I&#39;d say you know I&#39;ve
got a I&#39;ve got a lot of bands and I
really want to be in the show but now
it&#39;s time to memorize lines man so he&#39;d
say okay that&#39;s fine you&#39;re mute yeah
but we&#39;ll make you speak through your
instruments and you&#39;ll do live sound
effects on stage yeah next question so
what we ended up with was the show
there&#39;s really weird and fun it was so
much fun to do the favorite show
favorite show of mine have done a couple
hundred of all different kinds but
people loved it people would come back
and see it two or three times it&#39;s like
silly ridiculous you know a song filled
fun show
it was great things really changed me
though when I did this project out of
the swimming cities v and 30 other
artists from all over the country put
together raft made rafts out of trash
and remoted them down the Hudson River
into New York City and good shows along
the way I got to play another ship
captain I keep playing ship captains I
don&#39;t know why now I love ships and then
we took them apart we shipped in to
Slovenia put them back together went
across the Adriatic Sea and went into
Venice and we did a show there and I
that I directed and this changed
everything for me because the theater
was gone it was just the show and
the show kept going on and on so like it
is right now
point being boats are a great place to
know what you&#39;re you know how to get
done which you need to get done with
only what you&#39;ve got which is a kind of
a credo that I live by and the points I
just want to make is that we we spent a
lot of time trying to get things that we
think that we want and a lot of times we
don&#39;t really know what we want we get it
and it turns out it&#39;s not we wanted and
what I&#39;ve found is that working in this
way gets me something that that I end up
that I love and at least makes for a
better story which really is all you
have in the end isn&#39;t that right Edward
what you wrote a poem about it that&#39;s so
unexpected and we&#39;ll be quick here
please don&#39;t wash away the story for us
all that I have left else you leave me
with this body piled up atop this mess
it&#39;s true I&#39;ve done some things poorly
but I wrote in here on this horse at
least it was a pleasant visit and I left
an exquisite corpse thank you
[Applause]
