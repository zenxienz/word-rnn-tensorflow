I bring you the Ted globe now I&#39;m
guessing that everyone in this room can
find the three most populous countries
in the world that would be obviously
China India in the United States but how
about the fourth most populous country
in the world
Indonesia home to 250 million people who
knows where it is

thanks for my collars from TEDx 2x4
filming that it&#39;s really hard to
disagree with Indonesian business in Jon
reality when he says Indonesia is the
biggest invisible thing on the planet
and I want to turn my metaphorical lens
on it and try and make it a bit more
visible which is kind of cheeky because
obviously I&#39;m not even Indonesian but I
do have a long history with the country
so I work there was a journalist for a
few years in the late 80s and early 90s
and then I went back a decade later and
I worked for four years with the
Ministry of Health trying to help them
figure out as an epidemiologist what was
going on with their HIV epidemics and I
traveled a lot and I became completely
entranced with the country so much so
that a couple of years ago I packed in
my job and embarked on this 22,000
kilometers Earnie around some of the
least visited parts of Indonesia I was
on cargo boats motor bikes and buses and
what I found was absolutely dizzying so
up here you have a chair which was
described by Marco Polo in 1290 as the
first Mohammedan community in Southeast
Asia and it still calls itself very
proudly the veranda of Mecca and it&#39;s
populated largely by traders with very
hour of features and etc if you travel a
distance from equivalent of London to
Tehran you pass
13400 other islands 360 ethnic groups
700 languages and you end up in
Indonesian Papua which is home to black
skin Melanesians who are agriculturists
so the Indonesian national motto is very
similar to the u.s. national motto unity
and diversity and the diversity is
pretty clear but one of the reasons that
I wanted to undertake this journey was
to try and figure out where the unity
came from and I was over here
in a denaro one morning waiting for a
boat to take me across to the
neighboring island and there were a
bunch of market women they&#39;re taking
their salt fish across and they were
having an incredibly heated conversation

obviously about me but truthfully 6:30
a.m. is not my best time of day and they
were also speaking in Bhutanese which
ones I didn&#39;t speak and so I was kind of
zoning out until one of them actually
like hooked me on the nose and then I
had to engage and she said oh if they
confused because we can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re
Javanese or if you&#39;re Western and they
think you&#39;re Javanese because the way
you speak and because of the way you
dress but I think you&#39;re Western because
of your pointy nose and of course I
laughed but actually I thought wow
that&#39;s pretty amazing that people close
to the geographical center of Indonesia
think that someone who&#39;s from the most
populous island the Java is just as
foreign as someone who&#39;s from London and
that&#39;s not actually all that surprising
because for most of human history this
whole sweep of islands has been a
collection of different Sultanate
Kingdom systems
yeah the Dutch were there as economic
colonists sailing around those waters
for around three hundred and fifty years
but in as much as they ruled anywhere
outside of Java they did it mostly
through those local potentates so no big
surprise that people have very strong
local local loyalties now there was
reading a concept of nation until the
founding father sakano imposed it when
he declared independence in 1945 and
that declare declaration of independence
reads in its entirety We the People
declare the independence of the Republic
of Indonesia matters relating to the
transfer of power etc will be worked out
carefully and as soon as possible that&#39;s
it fairly longer than a tweet so what
sakano and his successor Suharto who
between them ruled for 55 years
it was they tried to impose some unity
and they did it was too uniformed armies
one was the military which had a
presence down to the village level
across the archipelago and the other was
the army of bureaucrats who were very
very strongly
centered in Jakarta here and it was a
very centralized structure and that
worked for a while but of course you&#39;ve
got all these different ethnic groups
there&#39;s all these different interests
and so after a while the pressures built
up and also had to step down in 1998 and
there was a period of chaos there was a
lot of conflicts some of it was there
was a lot of Atlantic terrorism and some
people thought that the country might
even break apart but in fact instead it
reinvented itself as probably the most
successful Democratic success story of
the earliest of the early 21st century
and that&#39;s particularly remarkable in
some eyes because Indonesia is the
largest muslim-majority nation on the
planet and obviously some people think
that Islam and democracy don&#39;t mix
terribly well so how did they do that I
think it&#39;s because they entrenched
democracy in a radical decentralization
that actually mirrors what what has been
with the pre-colonial structure which
was of separates Ultimates and kingdoms
and etc and that&#39;s allowed
I believe Indonesia to negotiate some of
its differences it&#39;s many many
differences and I want as an example
just to talk about two of them so old
Indonesia versus new Indonesia and Islam
versus multi-faith Indonesia now all the
world versus new worlds Indonesians are
actually living in different centuries
all at the same time so jerk answer is
hyper-modern tweets more than any other
city on the planet there are 70 million
Facebook users across the country there
are 80 million people living without
electricity and some people living in
some fairly ancient traditions so
example I was I was invited to a party
by a friend
her sister-in-law was giving a party and
we got all dressed up in our best chairs
and we went to the market and bought a
present and then we went down it was
very very busy this party and she&#39;s
threads me through and introduces me to
her sister-in-law who&#39;s sitting quietly
receiving gasps very quietly in fact
because she&#39;s been dead for eight days
and this is her funeral party and many
house are going to die today
now when the village isn&#39;t covered with
sacrificial Buffalo it looks like this
and obviously you can&#39;t have the same
building code for something like this in
West timber as you have for something
like this in Jakarta now in the societal
years that was problematic because used
to have this one-size-fits-all approach
to government but because of these new
democratic sultana&#39;s you&#39;re able to do
something that&#39;s much more nuanced and
have much more locally appropriate
regulations so another example comes
from whale hunting I there are two
villages in Indonesia to my knowledge
that hunt whales and one of them is la
maleta which is over here and on this
beach strewn about with whale bones
people launched their rickety wooden
boats as they have for at least 600
years to our knowledge and they go with
bamboo harpoons and hunt for whales and
I went out with them one day and there
was a hole in the boat and there was a
hole in the baler as well which is
inconvenient we&#39;ve forgotten to take an
anchor and on top of that I was the only
person on the boat who was not high I
drunk so truthfully we weren&#39;t that much
of a threat to the cetacean population
but they do catch whales on average
between 12 and 8 and 12 a year and
that&#39;s enough to feed the village for a
year when they dry it and cook it up in
this filthy spew and it&#39;s also enough to
enrage foreign NGOs who make emotive
YouTube videos about whale slaughter and
call for boycotts of Indonesian tuna now
llama Lera doesn&#39;t even fish for tuna
but other parts of Indonesia do it&#39;s a
big industry so Jakarta feels that it
has to have a regulation so it rushes
out a ban on whale hunting
and in the old days in the Suharto days
that would have got that would have got
passed down through the hierarchy to the
to Carter appointed district head and he
would have tried to impose it but now of
course the district head is appointed
directly by the local electorate and
what that means is that when he tries to
impose a law like this everyone goes to
his office protest and it&#39;s quietly
shelved
socha Carter is making laws for the
modern social activist globalized
YouTube Indonesia and local governments
are managing to modify those for the
life of our forefathers type Indonesia
and actually it works pretty well now
the Islam versus multi facing is
slightly more complex Indonesia acts so
they&#39;re two hundred and ten million of
the two hundred and fifty million
Indonesians are Muslim but it was never
an Islamic state that was highly
contested around independence but the
Constitution in the end guarantees
freedom of religion so there are many
religions including that&#39;s the blood of
a chicken in which my future entry in
his entrails my future was red
so there&#39;s but but at times of economic
meltdown there tends to be a resurgence
in Islamic extremism and I&#39;m sure many
of you will remember the most
distressing recent example which was a
bombing of Bali nightclub in 2002 in
which 200 odd people died now we haven&#39;t
actually seen many incidents like that
since 2002 which is when the radical
decentralization started to take place
and I think that that&#39;s because you now
have a situation where people up in the
veranda of Mecca for example can make
Sharia laws locally without it affecting
or scaring the Christians who live over
here for example in Ambon so it&#39;s a way
of defusing tensions but there&#39;s
something else going on as well which is
that Islamic extremism has been
Indonesian eyes now I learned this in
q Lily CD gay bar in North Jakarta where
I was doing some HIV research about 10
years ago and and this bunch of leather
jacket thugs came in and my slightly
naive study team thought they were just
clubbers and started waving syringes at
them and trying to sign them up for HIV
test and they turned tail and fled and I
went back to the to the club a couple of
years later just to say hi to the
manager or Aris and we were sitting in

her office maybe 2:00 in the morning and
this guy comes up he&#39;s all out of breath
and it is there hear the effe ear here
now the FAA is the Islamic Defenders
Front and they defend Islamic morality
by smashing up bars and clubs so this
was actually pretty scary for Ares who
was the cucumber she just reaches in her
drawer takes out this fat envelope and
the guy comes in and he&#39;s got his scott
would happen a scraggly beard in his
long white robe he was a lot of
salam-o-alaikum Inge and then she hands
over the envelope and she leaves I look
at her and I say hey these guys are just
as bad as the leather jacket his thugs
ever were and she looks at me Ron a bit
simple and says Elizabeth they&#39;re not as
bad as those guys they are those guys
it&#39;s the same guys but now by dressing
up an Islamic kid the police don&#39;t get
on their case so much so it turns out
that extremism is something like many
things in Indonesia that you can solve
with a fat envelope now this has
actually been reflected in the in the
political process also where the
mainstream party there was a party
formed in 2002 called the Pekka eff and
they were modeled explicitly on egypt&#39;s
Muslim Brotherhood and like the Muslim
Brotherhood they did very good work for
poor communities and became very popular
very rapidly and two years later they
won seven percent of the national vote
never was like oh my god Islamization
through the ballot box but in fact it
turns out that in Indonesia that can&#39;t
happen because if you want to be part of
this new democratic process in this
hyper diverse nation you have to play
ball with
everyone so the government at the time
wanted the Bekaa in their cabinet so
they gave them some cabinet posts
including the Minister of Agriculture
and the paper is wanting to cement their
relationships with all the other parties
started generously to dole out beef
import licenses which was completely
illegal so now the head of the pig ass
is in jail and no one talks anymore
about Islamic extremism through the
ballot box and these sorts of hyper
democratic but but very patronage based
networks are actually a very good way of
defusing potential conflict in this
diverse nation now Indonesia had an
election just a little while ago and it
was very highly contested the winner was
someone who represents a new generation
that come up through this decentralized
system who represents meritocracy and
public service but he&#39;s ranged against a
parliament which is still controlled by
the old guard and I don&#39;t have to tell
any Americans who are watching this what
happens when you have a popular
reformist president who is beholden to a
sclerotic and obstructionist legislature
so the the infighting has already begun
and it&#39;s actually a little bit ugly but
the fighting has not and in a country
that is so diverse and that&#39;s only been
democratic for 15 years
that&#39;s actually pretty miraculous and so
I would say you know I came in
arrogantly saying I want to make
Indonesia more visible but in fact
Indonesia has none of the coos of
Thailand
none of the political assassinations of
the Philippines none of the monolithic
policies of Singapore and arguably
Malaysia
none of the suppression of public
dissent of the Arab world the reason
that you don&#39;t know about it is because
it&#39;s not producing any of the political
chaos that keeps countries on the front
page and I would say actually that if
invisibility is the price of democratic
success long may it remain invisible
thank you
and if you mentioned at the at the end
the election of the new president Joko
Widodo and and the fact that is too
fragile this this transition and indeed
just two days ago the outgoing president
his party actually impediment basically
stripped away some of the rights to
elect local mayors and regional leaders
how&#39;s it playing out it kind of
contradicts what you just said it does
I&#39;m still quite optimistic because
Indonesians have a phenomenal talent for
compromising for muddling through at the
moment this really is a reaction of the
old guard against this threat that is
posed by this very democratic system
because this very democratic system is
actually producing politicians who
answer to the electorate and I think
we&#39;ve heard a lot in a few days about
how last few days about how electorates
actually don&#39;t feel that they are
represented adequately and this actually
has provided some representation but
there&#39;s a great disconnect between the
center Jakarta and the periphery and
this decentralization was a way of
dealing with that I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll
get away with rolling it back because
there is such a strong feeling now of
this is my right so Indonesians have
have developed a sense of democratic
rights in a very very short space of
time and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you
did read more about it on your front
pages in the next couple of months
because I think people will fight to
defend those rights but once they&#39;re
defended I think the democracy will be
consolidated just just a curiosity I
read your book Indonesia etc which
refers to the etc in the Declaration of
Independence and you barely make any
mention of the internationals Westerners
nor which is Bali
why so because it&#39;s the Indonesia that
Western has already no they don&#39;t need
me to tell them about it okay thank you
very much thank you
you
