go back the jolly giant you see in the
middle is my friend Chris since meeting
him on the first day of last week we
become very close friends couple years
after we graduated I got the phone call
that you would never want to get instead
of his jolly self Chris had a tumble in
his voice What&#39;s Wrong asked Jimmy chris
said I have cancer I didn&#39;t know how to
respond get into what to do we just
tried our best over the next year&#39;s as
Chris went through chemotherapy
radiation stem cell transplant he felt
violent valiantly against all the
obstacles four years later unfortunately
he passed away short 27 years the
staffing is Chris&#39;s story is not unique
in a country like the United States is
expected that one in two of the
population will get cancer in their
lifetimes the World Health
Organization&#39;s his cancer has one of the
greatest global risk knowing things like
that I&#39;ve devoted myself to cancer
research have an opportunity to study in
some of the world&#39;s leading medical
schools and done research and some of
the leading institutions but that
question still haunting that
conversation
so for the non-expert I have for the non
experts what are ways that they can
become advocates for their own families
without having getting an MD and a PhD
I&#39;ve distilled some of that my thoughts
into a simple mnemonic the four DS of
defeating cancer the first d is DNA
sequencing since we&#39;ve sequence the
human genome we&#39;re now being able to
sequence cancers and a death has never
been known before since our
groundbreaking work at Johns Hopkins and
some of the work Washington University
now we can sequence genomes of cancers
of tumors of patients on a regular basis
some of the top universities are doing
that now that can actually affect
greatly what the drugs you take and your
outcome for example we had a patient
come in at our school there was a woman
with finally climate cancer she honored
she ran other drugs there was nothing we
could do in addition to that for
counselors genome was sequenced we found
out actually one of her jeans pointed to
a new drug that&#39;s used for kids with the
kids with leukemia it was used and
cancer if the tumor melted away and two
years later she&#39;s still in doing well so
number one d DNA sequencing it&#39;s
important for cancer the second D is
doctors plural it&#39;s very very important
for you not only to find a good cancer
doctor but define cancer doctors because
no cancer doctor is the ultimate is the
ultimate expert always get a second or
third opinion for example the Susan G
Komen Foundation did a study a while
back looking at the cases of breast
cancer and woman and found that up to
four percent of the diagnoses were done
eral erroneously they estimated about a
hundred thousand women in the US why are
they walking on the street with
unnecessary surgeries or with cancer
that&#39;s not being treated in addition
there&#39;s been studies done for example by
the Veterans Hospital in the u.s. saying
that with the same surgery for
pancreatic cancer in experience there
have four times the mortality rate as
experienced surgeons so do yourself a
favor then what&#39;s up with one find
multiple doctors and get experts the
third D is drug trials unfortunately
oftentimes because of the therapies that
we have currently patience ran out of
drugs very very quickly but the key is
not to stop there there are tens if not
hundreds of thousands of drug trials
currently happening testing some of the
latest drugs for the least side effects
has ever been seen before and
unfortunately only 5% of passage cancer
patients enter into clinical trials well
not all clinical trials can save lives
and have a amazing dramatic outcome
finding the right trial may mean the
difference between life and death for
example one of my friends she had a
tumor of the gut and she was able to
have someone look through all the
clinical trials and found a specific
trial that just might work for her over
ten years later it&#39;s been a decade and
she is still with us from no drugs to
now still with us today so the third D
is drug trials don&#39;t give up then
continue to fight there the last D is
discovering even after you&#39;ve exhausted
the best doctors to this DNA sequencing
the best drug trials there is still hope
some of the scientists of today are just
engaging in some of the groundbreaking
discoveries and finding new modalities
of treating cancer that was never
possible before instead of drugs and
small molecules they&#39;re using biologics
to be able to attack cancer at a source
for example this is there&#39;s a method
called me no therapy so scientists today
can train your own immune system to be
able to attack cancer one of my
collaborators and aged one of the
pioneers for this area has been using it
for advanced in melanoma and we&#39;ve been
able to see patients with advanced
melanoma all over literally see the
tumors melt away and now this method has
been used for multiple cancer types
in addition to using your own immune
system what&#39;s also being a scientist
have also been able to train also back
here and also viruses engineering them
so they attacked only the cancer and not
the rest of the body there&#39;s great
excitement and this is one of the golden
ages of cancer discovery so sporty is B
is discovering so this brings we making
me back to Chris it&#39;s very fitting that
I&#39;m telling you this because one of the
quizzes genes growing up the East Coast
and was to see the Pacific Ocean one of
the last journey that we took together
one of the big adventures is traveling
to Vancouver and since peak of the
Pacific Ocean and I remember sitting
with him on the beach looking at a
sunset sunset similar to this and it
silence the silence was in the awkward
silence that I didn&#39;t know what to do
but it was a comfortable silence but
being a shy asian that I am I didn&#39;t
know how to really express my emotions
then and today I&#39;m excited to say that
you know what I want to sort of to tell
her tell him now you know so Chris even
though they haven&#39;t been able to tell in
person you&#39;re an inspiration to us all
to everyone who&#39;s fought cancer or is
fighting cancer will have lost people
let&#39;s continue fighting your heroes
thank you very much
[Applause]
