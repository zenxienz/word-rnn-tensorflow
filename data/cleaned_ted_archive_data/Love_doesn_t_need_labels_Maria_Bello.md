I am so nervous right now my heart&#39;s
beating a million miles a minute you
would think you have a label of me as an
actor so I&#39;m the I&#39;m the least person
you would expect to be nervous probably
but that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to talk to you
about today is the idea of labels label
labels we give ourselves and labels that
we give other people my questioning of
this started when I was on my knees I
fell to my knees in agony and I grabbed
the black rosary beads that my mentor
father Ray Jackson had given me and I
started saying the Hail Mary over and
over again after several emergency room
visits and a hospital stay I found out
that the pain was coming from a parasite
that was eating me alive from the inside
out through my months of recovery I
decided to read the hundreds of journals
that I had beneath my bed that I&#39;ve been
keeping since I was a kid and instead of
coming away with some definitive answer
of who I was I just came away with more
questions who was that girl the 13 year
old girl writing love poems in an old
green beat-up notebook covered in hearts
and who was that 30 something year old
that was still writing love poems in
journals covered with hearts about these
people partners in my life these people
that I thought were my soul mates
this made me question the idea of who
was my partner and what did that mean to
me and did I even have a partner I mean
who is your partner think about that for
a second and you&#39;re most likely response
do you even have a partner if not do you
want a partner I can give you sort of an
answer to this with some statistics
knowing that almost half of you in this
room are in committed sexual
relationships so you probably imagine
one particular man or woman as your
partner the other half of you this
ingles you might be thinking well I&#39;ve
been dating this person for a year and
they haven&#39;t committed yet so maybe I&#39;m
a big fat loser and I don&#39;t have a
partner let&#39;s face it in our current
social construct the label of partner
usually means the person you&#39;re having
sex with or the person that you are
supposed to be having sex with my my
questioning labels in that journey also
began during a conversation with my son
almost two years ago we were hanging out
in our house in Venice California that&#39;s
him
Jackson and he asked me this question
mom are you in love with anyone right
now I knew this was coming
I&#39;ve been anticipating and dreading it
for months I knew that my answer and his
response would have an impact on our
lives for a very long time I was in love
with the woman who was my best friend
who was like a godmother to my son
how and when would I tell him I finally
took a deep breath and said it clear
there was this long pause as I watched
to see what he would do and suddenly a
big smile came over his face and he said
mom whether you&#39;re lesbian gay bi
transgender or whatever
love is love shout it out to the world
so so that really that simple phrase
began my journey of questioning all of
these labels particularly the ones of
sexuality partnership and love was I
good girl or a bad girl I started asking
these questions of myself I especially
starting with the one who is your
partner for so many years I considered
my partner the person I was having sex
with I would be obsessed with them
completely and then completely connected
to them and felt completely disconnected
from them when we had broken up and I
thought oh my god now I don&#39;t have a
partner
this graph that you see here and when I
take an analytical approach to the I see
the error of my ways the heart
represents the two months I was in a
relationship with my prince charming and
I had sex with him exactly two times I
think the the tears represent the next
year and a half that I spent obsessing
over my partner my soulmate
this dude I&#39;m sure you can relate to
that I was so stuck in this idea that a
partner had to be that someone I was
having sex with that I didn&#39;t see all of
the partners around me it wasn&#39;t till I
woke up from an operation trying to
remove that parasite that I had this
revelation I saw five people standing by
my bedside my mother my brother my son&#39;s
dad my son and Claire and in that moment
I knew a little bit more of what my son
meant when he said whatever love is love
I realized that I had put this idea of
partners in the box but these were my
real partners who I would walk with
through my whole life and looking back I
thought oh I&#39;ve had so many partners and
I didn&#39;t know they were my partners I
didn&#39;t call them that at least my best
friend at Villanova University was a
Catholic priest named father ray Jackson
he gave me the black rosary beads before
he died he was the one that I had lunch
with every day at the cafeteria where my
grandma worked
he was the one whose arms I fell into
and I thought my mom was dying of cancer
he was the guy who enlightened me about
all these great writers and thinkers in
the world so wasn&#39;t he my partner at the
time I have two friends who are sisters
they have raised a daughter together for
15 years
aren&#39;t they partners when people ask me
how long my son&#39;s dad and I were
together I say were still together we
will always be together because we raise
a son together the next label that I had
to tear apart was about my sexuality the
question the answer that I also gave
Jackson that I was with a woman was was
confusing as well because now I&#39;m asking
myself okay so am i LGB definitely not T
straight and what did that mean I I&#39;ve
been engaged to several men now I&#39;m
going to commit a relationship with a
woman when the modern love article came
out I wrote a modern love article for
the New York Times
everyone tried to put me in a sexual
identity box
and I did not know which one I belong to
and it was I wish I had known then that
Facebook added more than 50 gender
identity labels okay 50 including
cisgender this woman trans man intersex
sis sis sis sis sis wait till you look
up sis many of us are sissies I&#39;ll tell
you that I&#39;ve looked these up and I&#39;m at
least 15 of them I can assure you you
are at least four and that wasn&#39;t
inclusive enough Facebook then now let&#39;s
you fill in the gender of your choice so
pretty soon LGBT is going to be LGBT
ABCDE QRS D and the rest of the alphabet
so I&#39;d like to shorten it and I call
myself oh whatever
this is the definition of web whatever
used to emphasize a lack of restriction
in referring to anything
or amount no matter what so since I&#39;m
not interested in giving myself or
anyone else restricting them with a
certain label I&#39;ve decided that I&#39;m or
whatever
now the third label that I had to deal
with uh this was a big one considering
that I grew up Catholic okay
I&#39;m gonna tell you something I&#39;m not
very proud of I had an affair with a
married man for two and a half years I
hurt people I loved he hurt people he
loved and that wasn&#39;t great but did that
make me a bad girl because part of it
was really great
I mean they like illicit phone calls and
the romantic emails and the sexy texts
and I felt a desire like I have never
desired before and considering that
about a quarter of you in this room have
either had affairs are having affairs
have been with someone or with someone
who is having an affair or has had an
affair makes me think that I&#39;m not the
only one who feels this way Democrats
have affairs
Republicans have affairs though it&#39;s
hard to admit someone said that all but
two of our presidents have had affairs
beginning with George Washington
can you imagine George Washington the
bad boy with the wooden teeth and the
great wig and all that stuff and it&#39;s
not only limited to men women have
affairs Marie Curie okay
Marie Curie the Nobel Prize winner in
chemistry and physics
she had a duel fought over her because
she was having an affair with a married
man Marie was a bad girl but you know
who is even a battered girl Eleanor
Roosevelt okay she she was on the
forefront of the human rights movement
and here she is not only having an
affair but having an affair with a woman
and the baddest girl of all my 65 year
old neighbor growing up in Conshohocken
Pennsylvania mrs. fee Renzi who
is having an affair with the Irish guy
who only dry-cleaning business up the
street from us so it&#39;s not just limited
to the famous either these three
questions started me on this journey of
not only looking at those labels but
looking at all of these labels in my
life and how they fit me now or they
didn&#39;t fit me was I still Catholic
because I believe in marriage equality
and a woman&#39;s right to choose can I take
that labels too
was I good enough mom because I spent so
much time on film sets but I didn&#39;t make
cookies for my son every day after
school was I Cinderella because I was
looking for my prince charming my whole
life I loved that photo Junior Prom get
the red shoes with the red yes I started
to redefine the label of partnership
sexuality and love in general you know
in the end I just think we should all
continue to ask questions about the
labels that we give ourselves about who
we are who we want to be who we love who
our Sheriff we who we share our lives
with I certainly at this point in my
life want to get rid of those labels
that hold me back
and my hope for you is that you will get
rid of the labels that hold you back and
take on the ones and create ones that
empower you I feel very very blessed
very blessed and honored indeed that
this started unraveling for me I feel
that if we keep questioning if I keep
questioning I will learn more about
myself learn more about my partners
learn more about the worlds experience
in general and get rid of any
preconceived notion about Who I am or
who any of you are so I&#39;d like to meet
every single one of you because
none of you have labels thank you very
much cheers thank you
hi hi wow that was a beautiful talk and
I want to know so much more later on all
the juicy details over drinks but I had
a couple of questions for you it really
brought up the labeling and then also
the shaming that happens I went about
people&#39;s personal lives and the
relationships that they have
specifically when there are failures
that I put in quotes and those
relationships and I was wondering what
advice do you have for young women and
girls who are being slut-shamed in their
schools and communities that is a great
question I was just at my son&#39;s soccer
game the other day in downtown LA and I
went into the women&#39;s room and it was
scrolled on the wall slut-shaming is
outdated I&#39;m using on the wall as I was
being that was right in front of me so I
think that the more that we talk about
it like we talk about labels now the
more that we will get away from defining
ourselves and other women like that
wonderful and I think the other thing
that I found really interesting about
your talk to was that you talked about
how this happens in all aspects of
different people&#39;s lives what do you
think each of us can do to eliminate
this stigma or release people from this
sort of judgment you know for me at the
end of the day as I said it&#39;s about
empowering labels and what that means
for you and the only labels you should
have are the ones you give yourself you
know someone can stand here and say oh
she&#39;s african-american because you have
dark skin
well in fact Claire my girlfriend is
fourth generation african-american and
happens to have white skin you might not
even relate to the idea that you&#39;re
african-american so I&#39;m starting to
investigate all of these labels and I&#39;m
finding it very exciting well I find it
really exciting too and I&#39;m so grateful
for your talk thank you so much thank
you thank you all thank you
