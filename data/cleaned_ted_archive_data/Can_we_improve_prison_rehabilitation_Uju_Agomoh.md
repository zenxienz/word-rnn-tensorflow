I&#39;m going to talk to you about prisoners
ex prisoners and their rehabilitation
imagine somebody would be wondering why
talk about these kind the people
imagining somebody will say really at
this kind of platform when we haven&#39;t
thought enough about those who are
outside the prisons
you may have thought they deserve it you
may have thought they should be locked
up and clear away the key I also used to
think that way until 1990 something
happened that changed the course of my
life I had the opportunity to learn a
little bit more about those we lock up
in the various police cells and the
various detention centers and prisons in
this country and by the way there are
about 19 institutions that have the
ability to detain persons in Nigeria at
the age of 24 in 1994 I decided that it
was enough to just read about these
things feel bad about them that I can at
least make some contribution it may be
modest it may be little but at least let
me do something so I started the
organization prisoners rehabilitation on
west reaction flour in 1994 16 December
1993
I wasn&#39;t with it but I saw the change
because of my life what would be the
right so that gave me a new sense of
awakening a new sense of consciousness
I found that contrary to my previous
perception the doors who find imprison
there are some that I innocent I found
that there were some guy were just there
because they are poor there is nobody
who could speak for them up on their
behalf I found that there was some who
were there just because they were
powerless they knew nobody they had no
context I find that there were some of
them who had little or no education
little or no jobs little or no family
ties poor communication skills I found
out there were some of them who had
brand into drug abuse and misuse I find
out also there were some who had been
battered as children sexually abused it
was I see these were indeed those who
the communities and indeed the society
have made once the where it&#39;s not only
about Nigeria in 20 2011 I had the
opportunity of doing research in 69
prisons quad across Kenya Zambia Burundi
Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda
and the stories were two different paths
the nuances and variations may be of
different levels but the stories are not
too far from what I have judged the
strike so the question I want to ask you
my dear sister this moment it&#39;s really
why should we begin to talk about
rehabilitation of those who will find in
prison it actually speaks to the fact
that it can&#39;t be you it can actually be
somebody your brother your sister your
father your mother it can be indeed and
I&#39;m telling you this of a truth it can
be anybody else
you can&#39;t indeed be anybody so the
notion my pleas have been our brothers
keepers and being and sisters keepers
the notion of at least given something
back the notion
of at least trying to make sure that
those you find in prisons you process in
such a way that when they come out they
will not have you offend again lies at
the heart of the whole concept of
rehabilitation to ensure that the whole
problem where we have over sixty percent
of the persons who will find in prisons
bring out of prison are coming back
because they have you offended making
sure that is stopped or at least reduce
to the nearest minimum in Nigeria there
are about two hundred and twenty four
prisons eighty five satellite lock ups
and the stories is also not different
across from one to another in Nigeria
you have a system where over seventy
percent of those who are in prisons are
indeed awaiting trial presence you may
think it&#39;s not a problem but when I tell
you that some of them save ten years or
more in those situation you can
understand so we need to help them so
that they don&#39;t be your friend we need
to have them because the people who they
are you have been in prison affects
their family their children their our
spouses we need to also think about
community safety because everyone you
see in prison one day unless he dies in
prison is going to come up so you may
not like them but please if you like
yourself you need to talk about
community security safety do I also need
to remind you about the whole notion of
development do you know about how much
this country spend in ceding prisoners
recently this reading was increased to
about swati&#39;s naira fidelity prisoner
now think about what it is so even if
you take 67,000 persons across 365 days
you know what that means
many of the people you find in prison
over 80% are still in their productive
years and you shout about what you can
do to help your nation become better
there&#39;s a lot a lot of things we can do
we can look at how we spend less in
prison how we can put money into
Community Corrections how we can ensure
that rather than spend money you have
these people do something else to
contribute to this fight you and I can
help break the shackles of your efendim
behavior you and I can help stop persons
coming into the prison in the first
instance
you and I can make a difference on a
final note I want to say to you whatever
it is that you feel passionate about
whatever you&#39;re serious is that you feel
so angry about you can do something and
there are stories I can tell you I can
tell you about collectors who was in
prison for 24 years because he was
mentally you this family could not feed
clearly could not pay for his drugs and
therefore they felt to avoid stigma do
could lock him up I can tell you about
the story of Felix orbital after we met
we met him in djibouti prison we had him
he worked with the organization to their
SELEX has a wife with five children and
they doing well done there are many do
you know there are not as lucky as
glitches to get out after 24 years they
may die there are many that are not as
lucky as Felix but from this moment you
can say what can I do you can do
something to stop somebody from even
committing offense in the first instance
giving them jobs identifying the areas
of risk you can do something by helping
those who are in prison have a new sense
of life in the sense of belonging what I
did in education in spiritual modeling
in rehabilitation of different kinds
including in vocational training you can
ask a private entrepreneur give
something back even in those places you
can also assist profit because at this
moment provides that not a youth
rehabilitation and employment village
village that can be said for thinning is
realized I can at least be there for
people to help them create jobs so that
they don&#39;t go into crime if you like
that can be very help those who have
family members in the prison so that
they have somebody to follow bactin it
relates I can welcome those who are
coming out of prison and make them
better let&#39;s start from the areas where
we have phase of control there are many
areas you have a space of control on
this issue you can start and you can
start today
Oh
