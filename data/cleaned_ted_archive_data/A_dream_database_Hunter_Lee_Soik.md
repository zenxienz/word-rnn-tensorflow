hello how is everybody Pat actually
contacted me on Twitter like really fast
and I give her my number and she&#39;d call
me right away so i have to thank Pat for
being here okay well everyone stand up
really quick I just want to do a quick
thing so this idea just stretch it out
right we&#39;ve been sitting got some lunch
okay so if you did not sleep last night
have a seat okay Wow alright if you did
not sleep see me I have a really awesome
travel pillow I promise I&#39;ll give it to
you okay if you slept one hour last
night and have a seat two hours three
hours four hours five hours five we&#39;re
losing a lot of people six more seven
eight is anyone still standing nine
awesome 10 10 okay awesome big big round
of applause for you that&#39;s great also
see me I have something special for you
too okay so last thing okay raise your
hand if you had a dream last night now
keep your hand raised if you can
remember it oh wow that&#39;s awesome okay
find me I have something special for you
guys too hahaha but we&#39;ve done is we can
we can take audio files and we can 3d
print them into things so while 3d print
your dreams just find me okay so I&#39;ve
always been very excited about dreaming
this idea that for one third of our
lives our bodies are suspended and our
conscious minds are free from the limits
reality so everyone on the planet dreams
three to five dreams for night in ninety
five percent of all those rooms are
forgotten in the first five minutes of
waking up so what if we create a space
for these dreams to self-organize and go
through information about our
consciousness you know that voice in
your head that lets you know you exist
actually I let you know that you&#39;re in
this room right now your consciousness
right there so we&#39;re proposing to create
the largest stream database in the world
and create a space for these dreams of
self-organized we&#39;re going to pick up or
Freud and Jung laughs off
and we leverage the 60-plus years of
technology that&#39;s put Rovers on Mars and
super computers in our pockets so a
little bittle bit about me see this
works all right so I spent 12 years
aggressively working in the fashion
industry I was not sleeping at all I
would average about 35 hours a night for
consistently 12 years I took my first
vacation 12 years to this place here
this is true Mexico it is beautiful the
beach there is so nice essentially you
have this like Mayan ruin on one side
and on the other side you have this
biosphere that&#39;s protected and I&#39;m
preserved so I guess it Tulum Mexico I
check into my hotel it&#39;s a tuesday i go
to sleep at four pm i wake up at six pm
accepted 6 p.m. on wednesday i did
essentially slept 26 hours i hadn&#39;t
slept that much since probably like the
fourth grade I think so I was in Tulum
for 22 days I slept more than I was
awake and I would have these really epic
dreams and they were fantastic the thing
about these dreams that I they would be
gone as soon as I woke up so I searched
the App Store and I wanted to find an
application which I could kind of put
this put these dreams because I thought
if I would just go back to my regular
job or my regular work then there would
just literally be washed away so i went
to the app store there was nothing
really that that was that amazing
everything really basic and we&#39;d been
doing a lot of work in fashion so I&#39;m
like well we could probably build
something that had the user experience
and user interface that we&#39;re used to
you know and I thought if I can build
iPad applications for sell McCartney
maybe maybe I can build this right so we
assembled a team of sleep scientists
from Harvard Berkeley and MIT and we are
cognitive neuroscientist we&#39;re
neuropsychologists and more
technologists who are really interested
in bringing this into the real world in
our idea is called oh here&#39;s all the
people there often yeah six th DS
Harvard Medical School MIT just often
people i hope everyone meet some one day
that really
okay so ninety-five percent of all
dreams are forgotten in the first five
minutes of waking up we believe that
modern alarm clocks destroy dreams
because they rip you through it&#39;s called
your hip no topics sleep state and this
is a state between sleeping and waking
so we&#39;ve created an escalated alarm that
gradually pulls you through your
hypnopompic sleep state it is ready to
record when you turn off the arm so you
literally turn off the alarm you can
speak or text your dream into the
application if you do audio will
transcribe into text and then we&#39;ll pull
out the key words from there we&#39;ll push
the whole dream to Big Data cloud so we
can anonymously organize the goal of
data to identify major themes and trends
so yeah I&#39;ll riot cool so I live in New
York and I unfortunately lost my
apartment in hurricane sandy and uh I i
went there and there was literally four
feet of like water stains when i walked
in apartments crazy anyway so that it
got me thinking like you know what like
was there an increase of rainy weather
dreams before Hurricane sandy or like
I&#39;ve how does barometric pressure effect
dreams or like what the dream is
different from people who lost the house
and didn&#39;t lose the house just going to
speed forward to hear a little bit yeah
over the dreams different from people
who lost the house and didn&#39;t lose the
house so then I&#39;m thinking about like
what if you dreamt about a white horse
last night and then we could say like
this is the seventh white horse dream
you had but of this year and then we
could say like you are one of seven
thousand people who had a white horse
dream and then we can create this little
kind of community of people that can
then communicate about that and say I
can figure out what that white horse
dream meant to them so Carl Jung is
amazing he thinks that that we&#39;re all
kind of connected in the certain way and
we&#39;re really excited
yeah so the Japanese sweep the lease but
do they dream the lease or what do women
at Ted dream about or with their kids in
Sao Paulo dream about we think this is a
huge data set that&#39;s literally being
forgotten every night so i&#39;ll leave you
with this final thought and its idea
from from john lennon and what he says
is a dream we dream alone is only a
dream a dream we dream together can be a
reality so thank you very much
[Applause]
