thank you the effects of aerobic
exercise on our physical well-being are
known but what about aerobics for
cognition and creativity so I&#39;m a serial
entrepreneur I created the LeapFrog
LeapPad the Livescribe smartpen which I
debuted at Ted and now I found in
affluence we make eye interaction
technology now our team that I fluence
does a process a tool we&#39;ve created tool
that improves our engagement our energy
and our creativity
during sedentary meetings so here&#39;s the
research aerobics indeed does improve
cognition learning memory creativity and
energy so what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve
created a tool called an IC be an
increased cognition break what this
means is we use very simple idea we
break during a meeting at 30-minute
intervals for 60 seconds of physical
activity to increase your heart rate an
IC B so here is a picture of a card we
created a card an IC B card that is a
description a problem a problem
statement a solution and on the back
there activities so today we&#39;re going to
do our inaugural Ted ICB so I&#39;d like
everyone if you would to stand up and
we&#39;ll kick off a timer momentarily if
you&#39;re at Whistler please stand up as
well if you&#39;re watching by video please
stand up you have permission to do this
I&#39;d recommend we&#39;ve checked out the
space you can do air squats which means
moving up and down we do them virtually
we have video conferences and we&#39;re
gonna kick off the timer and go now
let&#39;s go
see how far you can go what you&#39;ll find
and we found we give we gave ICB cards
to our board members and at first they
looked askance and then they did it and
they liked it and they realized at the
end of 60 seconds the meeting flow
continues it&#39;s incredible good what we
also found is that stress if you have a
tension in a meeting prior to doing your
ICB at the end of 60 seconds it&#39;s gone
it stops it really works keep breathing
keep breathing we go keep your back in
move hands out that&#39;s good if you were
in the row you could do push-ups or
sit-ups as well but we&#39;ll do that and
the Press says sitting is the new
smoking so we&#39;re doing something good
here okay then again if you if you&#39;re
watching by video you have permission
you can do this give yourself permission
so we&#39;ve made the art and the text for
ICB cards available and we hope at the
end of this you&#39;re not too sore tomorrow
you think that this is an idea worth
spreading
