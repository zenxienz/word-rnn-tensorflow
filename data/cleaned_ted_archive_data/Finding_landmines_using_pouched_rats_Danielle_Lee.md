an estimated 15 to 20 thousand people
are killed or maimed by landmines each
year
landmines prevent construction of homes
roads schools and hospitals formerly
war-torn parts of Africa and Asia feel
the impact especially hard because
landmines denied access to farmland for
some of the neediest populations a
perfect yet unlikely hero in this story
is the African giant pouched rat native
to sub-saharan Africa the pouched rat is
adapted to the ecological conditions of
the areas is likely to be used the
relatively easy to care for they&#39;ll eat
almost anything and they live up to
eight years in 2000 an NGO named a Popo
began training pouch rats in Tanzania to
detect landmines in neighbouring
Mozambique a Popo has discovered and
destroyed 2,400 landmines returning over
6 million square meters of land to the
country trained very much like mine
detection dogs pouch rats are pouch rat
training begins soon after weaning
tethered to a line individuals are
clicker trained and received treats when
they encounter TNT scented tea eggs
training progresses over several months
from a shallow dirt floor to an open
field where deactivated mines are buried
replicating actual working conditions
walking systematically up and down the
field the pal tracks will scratch at the
ground to signal a find but they&#39;re too
light to date Nathe advices and the
advantage of the pouch rat over dogs is
that they don&#39;t attach to their handlers
this makes it easier to transform them
between trainers and deploy across
different countries yet unlike
dogs we don&#39;t fully understand their
biology that&#39;s for my research funded by
the US Department of Defense Army
Research Office comes in I conduct basic
research science in service of applied
research interests so the scientists who
design the training and breeding
protocols can streamline this process I
trap and follow pal tracks in awhile and
note their basic biology tons of
questions about this species have yet to
be asked of a solitary or group living
what&#39;s the reproductive cycle of females
when do they become sexually mature we
don&#39;t know exactly when we find these
answers we&#39;ll know about their mating
system how they raise their young and
how young grow into independence I also
conduct behavior tests in the lab and I
compared their behavioral responses to
the genetic profiles examining social
and exploratory behavior plus their
reactions to various unfamiliar
situations provides deep clues into the
behavioral tendencies of these potential
soldier rats just as the army test
soldiers to assign them the regiments
like infantry artillery this research
assesses individual pouch rats to
determine what type of work they&#39;re best
suited for clearing minds and open
fields or inspecting dark cargo freight
containers or perhaps one day inspecting
baggage in noisy airports but right now
in the future we could be breeding an
entirely new breed of domestic service
animal rodents but the problem is
they&#39;re incredibly hard to breed in
captivity right now this research will
tell us more about their breeding
behavior so that we can produce more
animals and do so reliably moreover it
takes 8 to 12 months to train an animal
and in the end some can be successfully
trained
many cannot imagine if we can take a
drop of blood from an animal at this age
and determine by looking at their
genetics based on the behavior tests
we&#39;ve done which training regimen
they&#39;ll best respond to that&#39;ll tell us
what we need to know in order to
determine which are the best explosives
detecting animals selectively breed
those individuals so that we can train
them faster and deploy them sooner so
that we can save more lives thank you
