imagine a world without cybercrime I&#39;m
here to share with you today a solution
to one of the fundamental security flaws
of the World Wide Web we&#39;ve all seen the
headlines hackers are growing more
sophisticated and the stakes are rising
cybercrime is now a multi-billion dollar
problem for nearly every industry the
invention of the world wide web was a
great leap forward in technology but the
flaw in its structure was that any user
in the world could potentially hack
anyone else did you know that nearly
every hacker is in a far distant
location from the authentic account
owner our analysis of 10,000 hack events
reveals that ninety-eight percent of the
time a hacker is in a different country
altogether so we asked ourselves why
should our private data be accessible
from Russia Pakistan or North Korea and
we had an epiphany we realized that if
we could reliably determine the location
of a user accessing an account and then
block or grant access in real time based
on user-defined acceptable locations we
would stop ninety-eight percent of those
attacks today everyone said that
couldn&#39;t be done since hackers can spoof
GPS coordinates and IP addresses they
can appear to be anywhere in the world
to beat them to win we needed a new
weapon in the war on cybercrime my
companies built exactly that and this is
the first time that we&#39;re announcing it
publicly we call it verified location
technology or VLT VLT is a tamper-proof
method of determining authentic user
location without relying on gps IP or
other sources of information that
hackers can spoof using a cloud based
algorithm VLT blocks and tracks hackers
as the
attempt to access private data online
every wireless device pings third-party
devices around it our method
triangulates user locations within 1,500
feet using a variety of secure
third-party systems third-party systems
11
couldn&#39;t pretty is it on okay couldn&#39;t
predict that using a ver we are system
uses a variety of secure third-party
systems that&#39;s that&#39;s the key here that
we&#39;re taking in location data from
sources beyond the hackers control
beyond the device everything ranging
from NFC beacons to telcos to ATMs and
it&#39;s through that kind of system that
we&#39;re able to provide security
guarantees that were never available
before this technology is already used
by law enforcement to track criminals
and terrorists but this method is
becoming available for the first time
for individuals and businesses to
protect themselves from cybercrime and
that&#39;s the key idea if you can
infallibly distinguish between user
locations and hacker locations you
strike a winning blow against hackers
everywhere thank
