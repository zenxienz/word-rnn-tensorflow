I&#39;m an archaeologist first it&#39;s been my
passion since I was in grade school and
I used to pass notes to my friends
written in hieroglyphs I&#39;m a cancer
survivor second at the age of 22 I was
diagnosed with the rare and aggressive
form of ovarian cancer but instead of
cancer being the end-all be-all it
became a catalyst it allowed my dreams
to blossom into an idea rooted firmly in
human biology culture and history and
let me tell you how that happened I was
an undergraduate studying archaeology at
Pacific Lutheran University I had just
finished months of chemotherapy my
second field season in the Valley of the
Kings
and another major surgery I was bald and
I was limping my mind was still fuzzy
with chemo brain but I still remember
the reactions of everyone on campus
Luc&#39;s of confusion fear sympathy pity
but what happened next is a testament to
the antisocial academic had become
instead of feeling self-conscious or
embarrassed by their reactions I thought
immediately well I wonder what sort of
reactions ancient Egyptians with cancer
got and then what happened I heard about
cancer in antiquity so I collected every
ancient medical text I could I compiled
the references to cancer and the
evidence was staggering cancer not only
existed in ancient societies but I had a
real presence in history physicians from
ancient Greece Rome year Greece Rome
Egypt and the Arab world all referenced
cancer as early as 1 1500 BCE and
archaeological evidence shows cancer in
human skeletal remains as early as 6000
BCE now there are bits and pieces of
research but there&#39;s no synthesis of the
data so I got together every medical
text I could and I looked into the
archaeological evidence of cancer and
database and I found 230 plus cases in
antiquity on six different continents
now when I sorted that data using
different variables I came across some
interesting patterns and here&#39;s one
example the older you are the more your
cells have a chance to reproduce and the
higher probability of those cells
mutating and becoming cancerous and
that&#39;s why we associate cancer with
older age today but in the past we&#39;re
finding that a high number of
middle-aged adults for developing cancer
and this raises some interesting
questions to answer questions like these
we need to be actively learning how
cancer changed in the past during big
impact events in history like the
Industrial Revolution and the use of
tobacco now are these changes reflected
in the ancient DNA and cellular
mutations like the BRCA mutation links
to breast cancer can be identified
biomarkers of the disease like the
ca-125 protein used to detect
ovarian and endometrial cancers today so
the field of paleontology is a small one
it&#39;s made up of a select few researchers
who&#39;ve given their limited time to a few
few case studies that&#39;s why a few
colleagues and I got together in 2012 to
put together the paleo oncology research
organization and if you think about it
the impressive advancement of cancer
research it&#39;s been based on a limited
amount of knowledge over the last 100
years or so but imagine if we had data
documenting cancer over thousands of
years it could reveal how and why it
manifests in some and not in others it
could tell us what biological cultural
and environmental factors influenced our
human tendency towards cancer and it
could help with the prevention and
treatment of cancer in the future now
the paleo oncology research organization
was formed as a collaborative union of
archaeologists historians clinical
oncologists and other scholars that have
come together to dig into the global
history of one of the world&#39;s most
prevalent
and tragic diseases today I&#39;m an
archaeologist first it&#39;s been my passion
since grade school when I used to pass
notes to my friends written in
hieroglyphs but by studying the past of
cancer we can understand disease today
I&#39;m a cancer survivor second and as a
survivor I intend to give voice to those
affected by cancer in the past so that
we can help those affected in the future
thank you very much
