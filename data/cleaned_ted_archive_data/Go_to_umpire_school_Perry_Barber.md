the question I&#39;m asked most frequently
when people find out that I&#39;m a baseball
umpire is why did you decide to become a
baseball umpire yeah there&#39;s a bit of a
disconnect people are curious and that&#39;s
a good thing
they&#39;re curious about how I got there
that&#39;s major league spring training with
the Mets with a crew of all women yes
the first time that ever happened in
Major League history very obscure in
Major League history but it won&#39;t be the
last if I have anything to say about it
people want to know how I got there
from here my twin sister and I were
international debutantes we went to
private school all-girls private school
here in New York after this episode I
went on to become a traveling troubadour
for ten years I wound up opening shows
for Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel I
was very lucky had a lot of fun I needed
some way to supplement my profligate
lifestyle so I went on a few quiz shows
and I was a jeopardy champion when I was
19 years old but all of that changed
when I fell in love with baseball and it
happened when I was 27 years old there
was very little in my background that
would have intimated baseball umpire and
I don&#39;t know if I would ever have
thought of doing it for myself if my
mother hadn&#39;t suggested it to me it was
my mother and of course when she did I
didn&#39;t immediately say that&#39;s a great
idea I&#39;m gonna do it no I thought she
was out of her mind
and the more I thought about it the more
it seemed like something intriguing and
challenging and I&#39;ve always been up for
a challenge so I started on powering
Little League and right away I realized
that there were very few other women out
there umpiring
even in Little League at that time there
was one woman up hiring in professional
baseball but right now there are none
the numbers have actually regressed
they&#39;ve gotten a lot worse and it&#39;s not
because there&#39;s active discrimination
anymore especially in professional
baseball because it&#39;s illegal but
there&#39;s a sense of inertia that the
people that could make a difference and
get women to go to the schools and get
them out into professional baseball
they&#39;re perfectly happy with the status
quo and they&#39;re not doing anything about
it and it&#39;s going to take somebody doing
something about it for that to happen
and that&#39;s my role now I&#39;m doing
something about it I&#39;m looking for women
to send to the schools because they are
the only conduits to professional
baseball you have to go to school you
have to place high enough in the class
of 200 students when I went to umpire
school in 1982 I made my twin sister go
with me because I didn&#39;t want to be the
only woman in the class of a hundred and
eighty men and that&#39;s usually the ratio
so getting women to the schools is my
mission if I have a mission now because
when I started on hiring it was not as a
political act I did not think when my
mother said this little league is
looking for umpires why don&#39;t you try
out I didn&#39;t think well you know I&#39;m a
feminist I&#39;m gonna burn my bra and go
out there and do it it had nothing to do
with that it was not political it was
just something that challenged me and I
quickly found out that it was fun the
branding of baseball umpiring has been
all wrong for a long time
umpiring is fun it&#39;s a very stimulating
zen-like thing to do to learn how to
stay composed in the middle of chaos to
learn how to communicate in a way that
will defuse a potentially violent
situation very important in umpiring how
to manage a game so that it will
continue even over the blips and bumps
that are bound to come up that it will
come up without deteriorating into total
chaos
these are very important skills
especially for girls girls and women and
not only are they important skills for
girls and women to learn but they&#39;re
important skills for us to use because
we have a lot of influence over the
lives of the people that we touch right
everybody&#39;s got a mother a sister a
daughter and aunt so I&#39;m looking for
women to send to umpire school I&#39;m
talking about umpiring and I can feel it
in this room you are all now interested
in umpiring yeah that&#39;s the purpose go
out and talk about it think about it in
a different way think about telling
women that you know I think you&#39;d make a
good umpire that&#39;s what my mother did I
never would have thought of it if she
hadn&#39;t done that and umpiring is so
important because it can change the
world you learn conflict resolution you
learn communication skills you learn how
to conduct yourself in a way that helps
other people conduct themselves better
and that can end Wars there&#39;s a ripple
effect from it from learning the skills
and umpiring in parts and that&#39;s what I
want to do and please talk about it
spread the message spread the word think
about doing it yourself there might be
the next major league umpire a woman
sitting right here in this room or
somebody that you know and that would be
the greatest thing and I if there&#39;s
anything that I enjoy about what I do
it&#39;s things like going into the bathroom
here and having a conversation with
Elizabeth who told me I never thought
about something like that but it seems
like it might be fun yes it is so go out
and have some fun
