I remove limb I&#39;m a feminist and I&#39;m
here to confuse you the conversation
about Muslim women is usually about head
scarves and hymens what&#39;s on our head or
not and what&#39;s in between our legs and
the price we pay for it
I lost confusion because I know that as
a Muslim woman my story is much more
than head scarves and hymens the story
I&#39;ll tell you today is just my story but
I assure you that there are millions of
Muslim women out there who will confuse
you just as well as I can for kick-ass
feminist icons I have a long history to
choose from
in the seventh century there&#39;s Khadija
the first Muslim and Prophet Muhammad&#39;s
first wife she was a rich divorcee a
businesswoman who owned her own business
she was 15 years older than him and she
proposed to him my fondness for younger
men has a precedent first wave feminism
you say I think of a Cairo train station
in 1923 where the feminists had a
Ferrari removed her face well and said
this is a thing of the past decades
before anyone was burning her bra and so
today she must be turning in her grave
as so many tried to full faith bailed on
women and actually want to have this
conversation I come from a long line of
strong women my paternal grandmother was
a teacher a furious smoker a fast Walker
and a supporter of a soccer team that
most of her children detested my
maternal grandmother who sexually racy
jokes outraged her children was pregnant
14 times 11 survived the eldest is my
mother who became the first woman in her
family to get a PhD and she has three
children I am the eldest of those
children and I have chosen to have no
children my young my mother&#39;s youngest
child is my sister who she had when she
was 42 and my sister now is studying for
her PhD and she is dying to have a baby
now all that so far confuses enough
people I was born in Egypt where I
belong to my country Sunni Muslim
majority
at the age of seven my parents moved us
to London where I learned to become a
minority but I also learned how little
was expected from Muslim women my
teachers would say so
did your father bring you here as if
we&#39;re all just following him around the
world and I would say no actually both
my parents are studying for their PhD
and they would be shocked that my mother
kept her maiden name
and I would say Muslim women keep their
maiden name
I loved confusing that at the age of 15
we moved to Saudi Arabia and my world
turned upside down I learned there was
more than one Islam they were the
Islamic home but my parents taught us at
equals my brother and I were brought up
as equals
but there was an a clam outside that was
very different that treated women like
children who needed men&#39;s permission to
do everything and I fell into a deep
depression because I didn&#39;t know where I
fit in between those differences two
main changes and two main lessons in
Saudi Arabia I began to wear a headscarf
and I became a feminist and the two were
not mutually exclusive but on the
bookshelves of my university I
discovered feminist Muslim women
scholars who nurtured my feminism I had
vowed never to read anything by Muslim
men again so there were all these Muslim
women helping me know that I&#39;m not the
walking embodiment of sin I returned to
Egypt and there I learned that Muslim
men were not the enemy especially the
young ones
now I&#39;m kidding but I discovered
you know I have a weakness for them but
I discovered lots of women and male
scholars who help nurture my feminism
and more changes this time about
headscarves and hymens
because I removed my head scoffs it no
doubt no longer represented the Muslim
woman that I was becoming but I became a
journalist who became obsessed with
female genital mutilation because it
smashed my heart to pieces to learn that
so many women in my extended family had
suffered from this practice now this
practice is nothing to do with religion
in Egypt muslims and christians practice
genital cutting it&#39;s nothing to do in
religion it&#39;s all about hymens because
it&#39;s about controlling women&#39;s sexuality
and to this day I fight FGM every day
the next big lesson came when I moved to
Israel as a Reuters correspondent and I
move there because I wanted to see
Israeli and Palestinians for myself my
big lesson there was that I became a
liberal Muslim because I was seen by
ultra-orthodox Jewish neighbors and they
reminded me of the ultra-orthodox OD
Muslims that I knew and I realized I
realized that orthodoxy is much kinder
to men than to women and so I became the
liberal Muslim next chapter in my life
is when I moved to the u.s. in 2000 I
married an American but it didn&#39;t last
very long
not because he&#39;s been American we just
didn&#39;t get along and so when we got
divorced I decided to move to New York
but I didn&#39;t want to just get on a plane
and start a new life five hours later
and so I did that most American of
things I got into my car and took a road
trip and I spent 18 days by myself
getting to know America now as a Muslim
I&#39;ve been to Mecca on pilgrimage but
this was my American pilgrimage and by
the time I got to New York City my
reward was a Muslim community of people
like me and and this was a year after
9/11 and together me and that Muslim
community experienced one of the most
moving moments in my life when an
American Muslim woman a scholar of Islam
called a menorah dude held the first led
the first mixed-gender public prayer I
prayed Friday prayer I prayed next to a
man without my headscarf and on my
period
sacrilege too many but I delight to me
in corner and Polaski was another moving
moment in my life when Muslim women and
men from around the world launched a
movement called misawa which is a it&#39;s
the Arabic word which means the Equality
and it is a global movement for equality
and justice in the Muslim family it was
my feminist dream come true one night a
young British Muslim woman said to me if
I have to choose between Islam and
feminism Islam will win and the very
next day a young Egyptian Muslim woman
said to me if I have to choose between
Islam and feminism feminism will win you
see I told you it was confusing and
that&#39;s what I love about it sometimes
the confusion is just about showing up
my sister-in-law for her - it&#39;s about
headscarf and hymens one of the rare
cases she is she wears a headscarf until
the gynecologists so it&#39;s very much
about head start behind music she for
the past five years was the only woman
OBGYN doctor in a tiny town in Ohio and
I would tell her you are the true jihadi
because every time your patients watch
Fox News and hear about their Muslims
and them a Rabb&#39;s
you are the antidote simply by being
there and this summer many of us showed
up to confuse people by going and
standing outside the Islamic community
center near Ground Zero that you know is
park51
one night
one afternoon rather a very conservative
right-wing cleric or pastor called
Bill Keller not the publisher of the New
York Times but will kill her another one
was railing and ranting about Muslim
women and do you know what your husband
can do to answer your religion I said
actually I&#39;m not married and I and I
love confusing him because we had six
women standing behind him holding signs
up saying peace love and tolerance and
he was pretending to care about me so I
loved confusing him especially when I
told him you know what Jesus loved me
too
and so now I say I fight the lazy
stereotypes of Muslim women and I fight
misogyny in my religion through two ways
I&#39;m no fool I love confusion but I know
that there are violations committed in
the name of Islam against women but
that&#39;s not my Islam and Islam belongs to
me too and this is an incredibly
exciting time to be a Muslim woman all
those kick-ass women I&#39;ve told you about
they&#39;re my heroes and so now I imagine
myself standing in a boxing ring and on
one side I&#39;ve got the misogynist who
pretend to be Muslims on the other side
I have people like Bill Keller who
pretend to care about me and I fight
them both but I&#39;m also a bumblebee
because I&#39;m a public speaker and I take
my pollen my ideas from one place to
another and hope that they will blossom
into wild and challenging orchards the
pollen might be sweet but I sting like a
bee because like Muhammad Ali I will not
hesitate to knock you out and confusion
is both my right and my left hook thank
you
