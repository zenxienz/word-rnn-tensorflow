thanks Bruno so how can artwork help us
understand more about the complexity of
data this isn&#39;t an ordinary vending
machine if the machine that dispenses
snacks not at the press of a button or
the drop of a coin but when it hears of
news of an economic downturn it was
invented by it was it was created by
artist any Harrison and she hacked the
machine to listen to BBC news feeds and
then should dispense a snack when
certain terms are heard it really came
to life in autumn 2012 when there was a
UK governmental budget announcement and
when the announcement came out there was
a lot of bad fiscal news and the machine
just went crazy started dumping snacks
out as quick as it could so much so that
we couldn&#39;t open the flap to get them
out so it was really lovely that this
machine was kind of empathizing with the
audience and it was saying I want to
give you food to help you through this
depressing news I&#39;m really interested in
this idea of artists as translators of
data turning data into something that is
their own language and I use later a lot
in my own artwork I&#39;ve used data from
the translation of the movement of fish
to create sound and animation like this
piece of work called the lake and I&#39;ve
used data from light level fluctuations
in Finland to create this flattened
movement in this work called lepidoptera
I&#39;ve also used data from migrating bird
patterns to create flocking movement in
these tiny teapots called teeth look so
I&#39;ve worked with day for a life as a
material I think it&#39;s really brilliant
because it&#39;s ubiquitous and its really
manipulatable and more often than not
it&#39;s free so last year I was asked very
lucky to be asked actually by the open
data Institute to curate and
commissioned a series of data-driven art
where
their new premises now the open data
institute was set up by Sir Tim
berners-lee and professional Shadbolt to
ask the question how can we create
knowledge for everyone through a culture
of open data and the works that we
selected work for the artists use data
in many different ways that one of the
things that most of them did was take
data and turn it into something physical
turn it into something tangible that we
could actually see and move it away from
the screen and take it into into the
real world a bit more so this work is
called the body it&#39;s fine art is called
stanza it&#39;s over two metres tall when
it&#39;s a physical 3d scan of the artists
body and it&#39;s full of different
electrical components that change
dynamically when it picks up the
emergent properties of the urban
landscape around the artists home so the
sensors that are driving this work are
light temperature and noise sensors and
what the work is asking is how can we
use environmental data and embody it in
ourselves how can we reflect the places
that we&#39;re going to or the places that
we&#39;ve come from this piece of work is by
artist Fabiola kenzie antinori and it&#39;s
called the obelisk and unlike the body
previously which is quite a personal
piece this looks like global data so
this this work is looking at lots of
different basis fees and it&#39;s looking
for terms that refer to crimes against
humanity such as war aggression or
genocide and this work aggregates all
that data and turns it into a flickering
rhythm and the work is constantly moving
and changing in this of kinetic light
wave and what this work tells us what
this work shows is that it&#39;s a beacon to
remind us that crimes against humanity
are being perpetrated every second of
every day and that the road to peace is
long difficult and urgent
so all of these artists including myself
and been using data as an art material
they&#39;ve been using a material that
reflects who we are and how we live in
real time without this data the art
would be static there wouldn&#39;t be the
dynamic connection that happens and by
doing this what they&#39;re doing is trying
to help us find connections in the
complexity that&#39;s out there they&#39;re
helping this move away from data that
might be overwhelming or you know
information that might be overloading us
and moving us into a place where we can
think about data with a more natural
curiosity so if any of you are thinking
why should my organization or my
government department open up my data
you know is it not enough that that
might help transparency that might lead
to a more democratization of knowledge
and plaques perhaps a reduction of
corruption you can think of it that
you&#39;ll create a helping artists to
create more material to do work but
allows us to connect with this data and
with ourselves in different ways thank
you
