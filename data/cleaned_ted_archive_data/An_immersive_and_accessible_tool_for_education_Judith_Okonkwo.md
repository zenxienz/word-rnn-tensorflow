good afternoon ladies and gentlemen so I
want to tell you about what it was like
for me growing up as a child here in
Nigeria does a story I would always hear
there&#39;s going to be electricity for all
in five years you know that one right
five years became ten years ten years
became 20 and then 30 and then guess
what a few years ago I came across a
newspaper from the 60s guess what the
headline was electricity for all in five
years so this is not about the dream the
Nigerian dream of getting rid of our
generators that has not yet been
achieved this will not be a talk about
broken promises or about a future that
we cannot create but it will be one
about creating the future and about one
of the tools that I believe will allow
us to do that virtual reality now you
hear virtual reality and you think
Nigeria with all that we&#39;ve got going on
but virtual reality is a tool that can
transport you quite literally to
anywhere in the world you would like to
go or allow you to create anything that
you can imagine anything at all let&#39;s
see a little bit of what VR can do
[Music]
[Music]
so as you can see in that virtual
environment
whatever you imagine you can create but
that&#39;s not all virtual reality can do I
mentioned it&#39;s transporting you the clip
that you see the still that you see up
above is from a 360 video of an Ebola
camp quite literally if you wanted to
experience one you could put on a VR
headset and be in the midst of people
dealing with the Ebola crisis that sort
of experience now like I said you don&#39;t
typically think of Nigeria when it comes
to virtual reality but things are
starting here in July last year a
virtual reality showcase and residency
was held at the CC hug in Yaba the heart
of Lagos is tech ecosystem over a
hundred people came to talk VR and to
try VR of this number more than eighty
percent had never tried Virtual Reality
before but they all left inspired and
some of what they said was imagine I can
travel anywhere I want in the world and
I don&#39;t need a visa and you know how
important that is
or imagine what this could do for
education and those are the things that
we would love for you to imagine going
on in November last year we had a
virtual reality hackathon also in Yaba
the teams were asked to create solutions
across three sectors education health
care and tourism the team that won the
team you see on the screen behind me
created an app that allows people to
learn how to code in the virtual
environment now to create this if you&#39;re
familiar with virtual reality and the
Samsung gear VR you know it&#39;s a seated
virtual experience where you mostly
interact with your eyes but they had fit
and attached something called the leap
motion to the device that allows you to
actually use your hands for guests your
based learning in the virtual space a
hack that is unique and not that it&#39;s
been shared and get help
the rest of the world to tap into that&#39;s
the kind of innovation that is beginning
with Nigerians we are pioneers at the
moment so what do we see virtual reality
becoming for us here we&#39;re very
passionate about virtual reality as a
tool for education in Nigeria imagine
this imagine that you&#39;re a child in one
of the internally displaced camps in
Nigeria
perhaps in the northeastern part of the
country you don&#39;t have a school you
might not have teachers certainly power
is not reliable all of these challenges
would make education something that you
could not count them but let&#39;s see if we
could get a VR kid to you what if you
could have a VR headset perhaps the
Google cardboard a VR headset made out
of cardboard mobile device driven VR
mobile broadband and solar charging
devices all of a sudden were able to
provide a learning solution for children
that can allow those young girls in the
picture behind me to be in a chemistry
lab if they wanted to go and visit the
pyramids of Egypt
literally ladies and gentlemen whatever
you can imagine whatever you want to
create or make possible virtual reality
is a tool that can allow this so I ask
you the future is yours to create what
will you do thank you
[Applause]
