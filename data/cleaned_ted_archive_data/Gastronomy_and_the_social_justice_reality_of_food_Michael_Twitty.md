Wow you see that little knuckleheaded
boy on the screen he was a weird kid
that kid was me which makes a really
great upbringing for a future black gay
Jewish culinary historian
and I&#39;m not making up the last part I
really am one the chocolate chosen so
this feels like a Bar Mitzvah to me at
any rate that that was my best friend on
the table that was the collegiate
Webster&#39;s dictionary which gave me my
first big word I was very proud of the
word was hermaphrodite but of course I
did actual kid things like like fast
food and cartoons and superhero
underwear and one time I got in trouble
for trying to boil water to make package
ramen with heated stones like it was the
Stone Age that&#39;s what you do when you&#39;re
gonna be a culinary historian you
experiment but you know something like a
lot of african-american children I grew
up not liking who I was I didn&#39;t like
soul food I didn&#39;t like being black for
most of my life I&#39;ve lived at the
intersection of the illusion of race and
a reality of food and I&#39;d like to tell
you today how I changed my address from
loathing to love and revolutionized my
approach to both for the past five
hundred years we have changed our
relationship we have changed our
relationship with race and food in
multiple ways we turn our relationship
with race to faster than our food
and that has been endemic of this
so-called Columbian era of exchange in
contribution which is full of
exploitation and oppression so how do we
solve that through culinary justice
here&#39;s the problem our tables are
impacted by the multiple ways that
racism has fed into our food system
from chronic diseases to culinary
appropriation now to be clear culinary
appropriation and culinary diffusion are
two different things but when you
exploit a people for their culinary
heritage take the best from them and
leave the rest
that&#39;s culinary appropriation the
solution to which lives in culinary
justice i define culinary justice as the
idea that oppressed peoples have the
right to not only be recognized for
their gastronomic contributions but they
have the right to their inherent value
to derive from them uplift and
empowerment so thirty-three years ago I
learned about this amazing people any
gourmet restaurant would love to have
teach them all about their food and
their food culture they practiced local
eating they ate organically they
sustainably foraged you know they
gathered they fished they hunted they
have practiced whole animal cuisine you
know who I&#39;m talking about you guessed
it them my ancestors the enslaved
Africans of the American South one side
my great-great-great grandmother Haddie
born a slave in Alabama the other side
my great-great great-grandfather Edward
born a slave in Virginia now what the
slaves have to teach us about food in
2016 their culinary knowledge has the
power to save lives to empower the
oppressed and restore financial and
cultural capital to people of color
living today to learn this tradition I
spent 10 years to become the first black
antebellum chef since the Civil War
I had to go to the old self which is not
very different from the new salva we&#39;ll
leave that alone
you know the place where flags the
statues don&#39;t come down without a fight
but the bottom line is I began a project
called the cooking gene yes I picked
cotton for 16 hours it sucks I began a
project called the cooking gene where I
explored my food and family routes
across the Old South and I thought if I
cooked for people if I actually had them
cook and argue and fight and not have a
kumbaya moment but actually work through
the differences we could actually come
up with something new and you know what
when you call your cuisine soul after
something metaphysical I figure it has
the power to transcend difference and
work its magic so our theme today here
is dream I can&#39;t think of a bigger dream
than dr. King&#39;s vision of the table of
brotherhood and it&#39;s not a metaphor I&#39;ve
actually seen it see that&#39;s one of four
remaining slave cabins on a historic
plantation North Carolina where in 2013
myself and group of other black
interpreters cooked a meal for 150
people of all different colors and
backgrounds and you know what the main
ingredient that day was mutual respect
we sat down with southern white folks as
cousins rather than combatants you know
what the ancestors who lived in those
cabins they could never have dreamed of
a day when they would be honored by a
group of people of different backgrounds
sitting together at the same table of
brotherhood so what message today is you
have to keep cooking and eating and
dreaming thank you
