I&#39;m happy to be here
to Vancouver not that long ago it looked
like this only 16,000 years ago we were
here in the middle of an ice the ice
sheet and Vancouver we were under 3,000
feet of ice it was flowing to the sea
Vancouver remained under water as the
ice began to melt and the land began to
emerge and about 10,000 years ago people
began to show up on this northwest coast
and they were hunters and they copied
the structure of animals to build
skeletal boats covered with skins and
about 5,000 years ago the rain forest as
we know it matured and people began to
build boats by removing wood until
nothing was left except a canoe and the
result was a civilization unlike
anything anywhere else on earth so in
Vancouver arrived here in 1792 there
were thousands of people living on this
Inlet yet only a trace of them remained
when British comedy became a colony of
England in 1858 this was only three
blocks away from here you can go to that
intersection today all the trees were
cleared from Vancouver but Stanley Park
was preserved and I arrived in vancouver
obsessed with kayaks at age 17 I thought
I&#39;d died and gone to heaven there with
kayaks on the two-dollar bills and my
hero was Richard Henry Dana who had left
Harvard and run away to sea at age 19 I
joined the crew of the dishonor quoi we
carried anything anywhere and there&#39;s 40
thousand islands on the British Columbia
coast we came here we would tie up here
in Cold Harbor to drink beer downtown we
carry charter parties up burrard inlet
to belcarra park where I ended up living
for 19 years starting with a small tree
house 95 feet up in a Douglas fir
I wasn&#39;t trying to save the rainforest
everybody thinks he&#39;s trying to say no
all I was trying to save was rent and I
lived there for three years looking out
through second arrows at that where we
are now Vancouver harbour it was living
in the forest canopy was an entirely
different world and tree Ranger nature&#39;s
way of digitizing time so this piece of
cedar from the treehouse spans five
hundred forty-four years in 1741 only
three inches ago the Russians arrived
surrounded by amphibious beings they
named Aleuts this kayaker they&#39;ve
labeled americanski and this particular
species of high-speed kayak soon went
extinct and I did what Stewart did I
tried to extract its DNA and bring it
back but you have to bring back breeding
pairs it&#39;s like the passenger pigeon or
the woolly mammoth you have to bring
back the flock or the herd so with the
help of many people I tried to bring
back the by dark of just the Russian for
kayak as a way of life not as a sport
and for a brief moment it worked and we
built the mother of all kayaks named
them out fair weather was 48 feet long
and it&#39;s still sitting on the beach at
belcarra Park just eight miles from here
out through the Narrows this is a relic
of the dream that one day a
human-powered civilization would return
to the northwest coast sort of a crazy
youthful dream so like me Richard Henry
Dana went back to Harvard became a
lawyer for the rest of his life but he
published the seaman&#39;s friend to help
the this or the mistreated seaman of the
19th century who hoisted the sales that
at that time powered the world and the
idea I want to leave you with thanks to
Stuart is the D extinction of commercial
sale this maybe next year it may be
100 years maybe in a thousand years but
commercial sale deserves to come back so
ninety percent of global trade is still
ocean freight even in the 19th century
the efficiency of sailing ships reached
60 percent because there&#39;s no
transmission losses the motion of the
atmosphere translates directly into the
movement of freight in the trade winds
it&#39;s easy to capture far more energy
than is needed to drive the ship and
through hybrid sail with onboard energy
storage it enables the redistribution of
wind in space as well as in time and
sail lost out to steam not over speed
but over scheduling and we can solve
that problem quite easily today so
imagine the entire planet as a single
wind turbine and the oceans are the
hydraulic bearing and the blades of the
turbine are a fleet of ships and that&#39;s
where we are here thank
