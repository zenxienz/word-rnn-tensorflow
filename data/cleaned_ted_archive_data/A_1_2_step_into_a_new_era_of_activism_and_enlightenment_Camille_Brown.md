when I was a baby I loved playing with
toys but my favorite toys were Lego
bricks when people asked me what I
wanted to be when I grew up I said I
want to be a Lego builder there was
nothing like it
putting the bricks together taking them
apart I remember when I was at my
grandparents house running up the stairs
turning on the TV to my favorite cartoon
the gummi bears and diving into my Legos
I had a system and a structure that
consisted of a choreographed routine to
the opening credits of the gummi bears
choreography and building have been at
the center of my life for as long as I
can remember and these are my building
blocks building blocks of perseverance
as a young dance student I was not
considered to have the ideal body so
when I got to college I had a very hard
time I called my mom and I told her I
was ready to transfer she said Camille
you just got there give it some time
find a focus so I decided to focus on my
dance composition classes and
Composition is where they teach you how
to make your own dances so there I was
building my blocks I realized that I
didn&#39;t have to wait for anyone to tell
me when I could dance I can do it
whenever I wanted I found my joy and my
mom and I never spoke of transferring
again building blocks of courage in 2013
I choreographed a work called mr. tall I
rants about african-american stereotypes
and I got pushed back why are you doing
this President Barack Obama is in the
White House we are in a post-racial
Society I knew that wasn&#39;t the case so I
started pulling out more current
stereotypes the thug the video vixen and
asking how are we perpetuating these
stereotypes
well the voices got quieter and quieter
but I&#39;m glad they spoke up because they
made me think about audience engagement
in the dance world audiences are not
conditioned to have a direct dialogue
about what they just saw
so I wanted to know what would happen
when the performers
the audience decompressed together we
are all coming at race from different
perceptions different background
information what happens when we&#39;re all
together and we&#39;re really honest about
how we&#39;re feeling about stereotypes so I
combine the dialogue with the
performance into one whole performance a
young girl 12 years old during that
dialogue session asked me how did you
overcome your freedom and I told her it
wasn&#39;t that freedom left it was that I
wasn&#39;t going to let anyone dictate what
stories I was going to tell or how I was
going to tell them I kept building my
blocks building blocks of realness as an
african-american female I live between
two tropes the angry black female and
the strong black female vulnerability
and joy are two narratives that I rarely
see so I have created a work called
black girl linguistic play that depicts
a carving out of a self-identity in
American society and along with that I
have created the initiative called black
girl spectrum which connects with
organizations to help empower women how
can we get them to build their own
dances I met with a group of young
students in New York City around 16 to
18 years old young black women and I
asked them when you hear the phrase
black girl what comes to mind
they said ignorant Ratched I even heard
pregnant at 17 well I was horrified and
I asked them is this how you think about
yourself and they said no this is how
the world sees us and I was so proud of
them because they were making a clear
distinction between perception and
reality but I was sad because we were
two totally different generations
feeling the same thing we were both
fighting for our humanity the next month
I went to a women&#39;s prison in Ohio the
african-american population of women is
growing rapidly in the prison systems
and if I&#39;m going to speak about black
girls I have to incorporate them in the
situation in the in the cut in the
conversation
so I came in there ready to empower them
but what happened they empowered me they
lifted me up and the thing that I was
surprised to see was their joy
regardless of their current situations
they weren&#39;t going to allow that to
dictate them who they were and they
taught me a lot about mental
incarceration versus physical
incarceration and I thought about my joy
who was i before the world defined me I
think about what I used to tell people
about being a Lego builder and in a
sense I am one I have created systems
and structures as a dancer choreographer
and community builder I have taken a lot
of person it has taken a lot of
perseverance courage and realness to
keep building my blocks but I have to
remember my joy I have to remember that
girl that was watching the gummi bears
and building her Legos because at my
core I am simply a girl that loves to
play thank you
