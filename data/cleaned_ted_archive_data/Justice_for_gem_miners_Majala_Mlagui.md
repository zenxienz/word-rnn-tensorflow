the story of precious stones diamonds
emeralds rubies and sapphires has been
told often most of us are aware of the
good the bad and the ugly blood diamonds
from the Congo conflict emeralds from
Colombia blood ruby from Burma a
globally recognized challenges within
the gemstone industry but little is
known and told of the colored gemstones
of adorn our day-to-day jewelry from
brilliant blue tanzanites Tomlin&#39;s that
reflects the yellows oranges and greens
of African sunsets and blushing pink
rhodolite garnet and even far less is
told of the gemstone miners and even far
less installed of the gemstone miners
ago two life-threatening extremes to
mine this beauties
six years ago i jumped into my first
mine which was about five minute walk
from my grandfather&#39;s house and six
years ago a stone named color change
garnet romanced me into the world of
precious mining stones and in the
iniquities of value that exists in the
industry allow me to take you on a
safari close to the heartland of the
sovereign national park home of the
mighty red elephant to a place called
tighter to better that is known to have
a wealth of colored gemstones the most
famous being the tsavorite green garnet
the journey of a colored gemstone can be
an eccentric and interesting thing what
can start off as an innocuous rural
activity such as digging for pit latrine
can lead to the discovery of a seam of
precious stones little and the rush of
mining activities that will make
millionaires of some and purpose of
others once a gemstone theme is found
some of the miners who roam the lands
looking for mineral rich areas will
settle in and look and start mining
sometimes for months and end with
limited access to water in hot
temperatures threatened by wild animals
and in some cases with crude manual
tools and low financial capital
once a colored gemstone pocket is found
there&#39;s usually a by a broker waiting to
buy the stones sometimes it&#39;s
exploitative ly low prices and using
questionable tactics such as plying the
miner with intoxicating substances to
reduce his negotiating capacity the
broker will then take the stone to the
nearest Maine town and there he&#39;ll sell
it to a dealer who may have connections
in Europe America or Asia two years ago
a community of miners came together with
a goal to mine in a unified manner with
political goodwill with political
goodwill assistance from a government
parastatal arm and the power of pooled
investment the efforts to mines are very
green Ghana to change the lives of many
miners and provided a source of income
for over 2,000 residents in this area
something that wouldn&#39;t have happened
with a large-scale mine and while
there&#39;s plenty of positive good things
happening on the ground there&#39;s still
work to be done but art is no
small-scale miners go through a number
of challenges the main three being
access to finance for more responsible
and efficient mining operations access
to markets to get fair value for the
minerals and knowledge and capacity to
be able to value add to the mined
product the global colored gemstone
industry is valued of about a 10 billion
dollars a year and while art is not
small-scale miners produce over 80% of
the global output they and the producing
countries rarely get to see a
commensurate percentage of the colored
gemstone value to try and change things
from the ground up I found it a social
enterprise called somani
which is a Swahili word meaning value we
work with stakeholders in the industry
to create an enabling environment
through addressing the mining policy and
regulatory frameworks sensitizing
artisanal miners on the value chain
as well as sourcing for accessible and
ethically driven markets for the colored
gemstones while while the whole more the
story is a bit challenging see if most
of us questions the provenance of the
colored gemstones on the jewelry that we
wear this wouldn&#39;t more jeweler&#39;s more
wholesalers gemstone buyers to be
conscious and responsible in the
interactions that they have with a
supply chain and this will hopefully
lead to a greater value of the benefit
of the chain a greater value of the
colored gemstones going back to the
miners who are mining this beautiful
colored gemstones thank you
