so I&#39;m a diet doctor which essentially
means when people hear what I do they
kind of cower over their plates and and
try to hide their french fries but don&#39;t
worry about it that&#39;s not what I do I
don&#39;t believe in wagging my finger and
telling you what you should eat and what
you shouldn&#39;t eat and quite frankly I
eat more french fries than most of you
anyway so please relax eat your food and
let&#39;s talk about something that&#39;s
important to all of us children one of
the most fascinating studies I&#39;ve ever
seen showed that more parents are
hesitant to talk to kids about weight
than talking about sex drugs and alcohol
combined my jaw hit the floor when I
first saw that just like many of you I
think it&#39;s because we never learned how
to do it I certainly didn&#39;t learn when I
became a parent and I definitely didn&#39;t
learn it in medical school so I got
together with a bunch of colleagues of
mine and we wrote a great resource on it
it&#39;s called the weigh-in guide and it
does just that it tells you how to talk
to kids about weight it&#39;s free it&#39;s a
great resource just google my name and
it&#39;ll come up download it take a look at
it I think it&#39;ll be a really interesting
read and really helpful for you if you
have kids or any loved one who may
struggle with in this area but I don&#39;t
think talking points are enough I want
to offer you four big-picture insights
that will help you think about this
issue and frame your your discussions
with kids about this first we live in a
society that essentially sets us up for
weight gain and poor health by default
the unhealthiest and highest calorie
foods are the cheapest foods they&#39;re the
most convenient foods they tend to be
the largest portion foods they&#39;re the
most heavily advertised foods they&#39;re
engineered to be the tastiest foods and
they&#39;re marketed to be the most fun
foods and kids are particularly
susceptible to all this they&#39;re
essentially sitting down
so this is why I donate so much of my
time to doing policy work and advocacy
work in this area if we can create
supportive environments that make it
just a little bit easier to be healthy
then everybody wins it&#39;s a really
important area to think about next
always think about health not appearance
this isn&#39;t a euphemism the outward
appearance of excess weight gain is a
red herring obesity is a health issue
studies show that kids with obesity have
at least as impaired quality of life as
kids with cancer it&#39;s partly because
when you have cancer people treat you
with the utmost of respect and love and
compassion when you have obesity often
people shame you and blame you and
ridicule you for the way that you look
it&#39;s absolutely heartbreaking so think
about that one as well it&#39;s really
important next always focus on behaviors
rather than weight having excess weight
isn&#39;t an actionable behavior it&#39;s a
result of many behaviors as well as our
biologies and our psychologies and our
environments and literally hundreds of
other things so telling someone to just
lose weight is essentially as nebulous
as telling someone who&#39;s depressed to
just cheer up it offers no therapeutic
leverage instead think about what I call
the ABG&#39;s should be ABCs if you squint a
little bit it&#39;ll work I just couldn&#39;t
come up with a see a actionable
behaviors talk to kids about things that
you can directly do like go for a bike
ride together or take a healthy cooking
class together be be specific telling
your child to go clean his room is not
nearly as productive as asking him to
put his shoes away and make his bed and
see get their input get them involved in
the decision-making process because it
builds their autonomy and buy-in
and finally think about baseball rather
than archery let me explain to you what
I mean by that archery is about accuracy
precision perfection
it&#39;s intense in baseball on the other
hand if you got a hit 30 percent of the
time you&#39;re an all-star Babe Ruth struck
out one in every seven times he came to
the plate and he&#39;s the best baseball
player that ever walked the face of the
earth we make more than 200 food
decisions every single day it&#39;s
paralyzing to think that you have to
always choose broccoli over bacon you
don&#39;t there&#39;s nothing beneficial about
doing that every single time it&#39;s not
possible so what we want to do is help
kids is help kids understand that
there&#39;s all sorts of ups and downs and
left&#39;s and rights and backs and fourths
and zigs and zags in weight management
as well as in life and help them build
an approach to navigate all those backs
and fourths without needing to be
perfect if we can do that we&#39;re doing so
much for them and and it&#39;s especially
important for us to remember that
ourselves what I see in the clinic over
and over and over again is parents who
love their kids so much and they&#39;re so
anxious about their kids weight in their
kids health that they overwhelm their
kids expecting them to be perfect with
every food decision and every time they
go out running or or anything like that
so this may be helpful to help you step
back from this the best evidence we have
for helping kids with health is helping
them get out of adolescents at the
healthiest weight possible and that
means that they don&#39;t have to do it
today they don&#39;t have to do it this
month maybe not even all this year it
means that we can help them make smart
slow tangible and reasonable steps
forward so that they can build a
platform for their lifelong health and
weight thank you very much
