I haven&#39;t always worn the burka growing
up I used to hate it I thought it was
oppressive and people would think I&#39;m so
religious that nobody would want to be
friends with me
so I was 17 and at my first term at this
modern liberal University in Dubai and I
was struggling with the issue of fitting
in I don&#39;t know who I was or what social
group did I fit into so you know I
looked around and I thought everybody
wanted to be part of the cool group so I
should do the same thing right except
those girls were really skinny and
dressed up like Paris Hilton on steroids
so I didn&#39;t have the time to get skinny
for obvious reasons and I just went for
the kill so I went for the clothes and I
remember sitting in a math class wearing
this top that I had bought the night
before and I&#39;m not going to give you
guys too many details but I can tell you
that a plunging neckline was involved
and I remember sitting in that classroom
and I&#39;m pulling it up uncomfortably and
just thinking you know I&#39;m trying so
hard and I was so unhappy and my parents
were unhappy at this weird odd dressing
sense of mind and you know I was nowhere
close to the to being cool and at that
time I think what was also happening was
my mother thought her daughter&#39;s going
to do some more weird so she
thought you know what you have to start
wearing the burka and I said oh my god I
hate it but then the thing is in our
family tradition my mother my
grandmother my aunts and many cousins
they all wear the burka and it&#39;s
something that&#39;s usually initiated at
the age of puberty but in my case my
folks were a little bit more lenient I
hated the burka but something very
strange happened I fell in love with it
took me a couple of years but I did I
felt bad it brought me closer to my
cultural heritage
it made me a lot more stronger and it
gave me a sense of power the burqa is a
very important part of my cultural
heritage my family&#39;s heritage the place
where I come from but the problem is
that my burqa episode was also happening
during the time of 9/11 so the media was
filled with all these words you know the
burqa and the hijab and the niqab and
what a lot of people don&#39;t understand is
that different the names of the veils
they all have different definitions in
different cultures but the broad
generalization is that the hijab is the
headscarf the niqab is the face veil and
a horse is not involved usually and the
burqa is the full body cover and it
comes with or without the veil so what
I&#39;m wearing right now is the burqa in my
cultural context
now the origins of a burqa are not in
Islam so it&#39;s not an exclusive Muslim
identity it&#39;s something that you know we
see it in a lot of different religions
as well the concept of covering the hair
or different kinds of veils we see it in
personality we see it in Hinduism we see
it in Judaism as well and lately we also
see it with hipsters and superheroes
now being split between Rajasthan the
place where I was born and Dubai where I
grew up and London where I now live it&#39;s
very interesting to observe the cultural
reaction to the Baraka in Dubai I am not
fashionable enough I don&#39;t do clingy
stuff and in India the burka is
associated with the Muslim minority
stereotype of illiteracy and poverty so
you know a lot of times when in India I
walk into this decent hotel or a
restaurant not even posh and I walk in
and I have people coming at me from
different directions saying do you even
know where you&#39;ve come to are you sure
you&#39;re in the right place and you know I
start speaking to them in English and
then they say oh okay so madam you&#39;re
not Indian right so you&#39;re from Saudi
Arabia and I look at them and I was like
no thank you I&#39;m fine and you see it&#39;s
not just the the cultural heritage that
the book about me closer to but it&#39;s
also the sense of power and this
confidence that it gave me the power to
choose and the confidence to to be
myself to to be the person who to
respect myself into the be to be the
person that I really am a lot of people
when we talk about the burqa always end
up bringing the bikini in as well but
the thing is each one of them have to be
viewed in their cultural context if you
come to my village or in any other
community for example where women will
and if you walked without the veil you
are going to attract unwanted an unkind
attention but if you will if oh my god
that&#39;s the Indian image if you fail it&#39;s
going to you become a part of the crowd
and it&#39;s easier for you to go out and
about the in the West the bikini isn&#39;t
the most provocative thing you can wear
and in my world the burka is not the
most conservative thing the true value
of the book and the bikini lies in the
fact that
woman should get to choose what she
wants to wear but all of this has really
helped me in making myself stronger when
it came to dealing with alienation and
stereotyping for example I was in London
and I get onto this public bus and I
come and sit next to this kid who must
be five or six years old and she gets up
and she says you I&#39;m not going to sit
next to these people but having said
that I&#39;m also guilty of this and I love
the story I was a couple of months back
in this Indian Airport and you know it&#39;s

3:00 in the morning really sleepy and in
this long immigration queue and you know
we&#39;re all standing there and all of a
sudden I see this guy a couple of steps
ahead of me and he&#39;s wearing the shabby
scarf but his little dirty bag but
holding a Koran in the other hand and
stood there and I panicked and I looked
around and I was like can nobody see
this guy is he not dangerous and that
moment being the only Muslim woman in a
burqa freaking out that another Muslim
guy was really not lost on me see each
of us men and women we all wrestle with
this balance of sartorial tensions do
you wear something that feels good on
you do I wear something that honors my
set of values even maybe my cultural
heritage or should I wear something that
conforms to other people&#39;s perceptions
I love the burqa I think it did great
for me yes I used to hate it but I
didn&#39;t dwell on the negative perceptions
I reimagined it to suit the vision of
the empowered woman that I wanted to
become and my invitation to all of you
is that the next time you guys meet
someone who wears a burka or a bikini or
maybe even Crocs you look at them
you I love props but you look at them
you pause and you remember that the
brunt of all your judgments and bias it
doesn&#39;t hit the it doesn&#39;t hit the cloth
it hits the human being behind it and a
lot of times it damages them and I truly
hope that we can all start by undoing
this unnecessary prejudice thank you
