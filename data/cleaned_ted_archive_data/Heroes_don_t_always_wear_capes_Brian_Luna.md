only a little depressing that that
yellow line kind of kind of sunk down a
little bit but we discussed it last
night and that turns out this because
you are just so blissfully happy happy
at the beginning of a relationship so
our next speaker has been an audience
member before that&#39;s how I first met him
and now he&#39;s here in the stage so this
could be you next year he he comes from
the same home state as I do from Texas
and he is here to share with us a deeply
personal story about growing up there
please welcome Brian Luna first day of
sixth grade got my clothes all laid out
every once in a while like Lance over
make sure they&#39;re still there now that
may seem a little paranoid unless you&#39;ve
lived on the south side of San Antonio
now if this was the south side now I
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if someone stole
that last sentence my dad&#39;s alarm goes
off and I grab the only two things he
was able to buy for me for that year
it&#39;s the 80s I shut out in my brand-new
pinstripe gray leather pants with enough
difference to make Michael Jackson go
down my dad drops me off of my grandma&#39;s
before school and this way he can go
looking for work now this is where I get
ready and buy get ready I mean do
everything I can to hide this head of
hair that may as well be a sombrero and
not just to the kids at school which my
grandma&#39;s well where did you get that
curly kinky hair
nothing many of us Nina head like a
sponge Greg Greg grandma says I had hair
like Jesus goofy though she met some
maintenance man hey sue so what could
God do a good guy
I creeped into the bathroom I sneak into
the bathroom Aqua Net nowhere
what&#39;s mouth and you better not be
playing with my mood
I&#39;m not bring on that sixth grade I
finally get to school at I don&#39;t know I
don&#39;t know if the Sun catches a glimpse
of one of my many zippers or what but
all of a sudden my pants become the
focal point of the entire classroom haha
hey check it out it looks like Kmart
threw up on you hey hey it looks like
Duran Duran began in Mexico hey you know
what our gardener got married in the
same outfit okay the ha ha like a little
imagination but they think they hurt the
most these this radical leather
camouflage I was hoping for now made me
a target especially since it wasn&#39;t real
leather
now the secret of my poverty belongs to
everyone around me a few months earlier
though I had every GI Joe and Superman
t-shirt out there I mean in other words
I had it all I just um I didn&#39;t know was
all stolen he&#39;s not a criminal okay yep
by definition he&#39;s a criminal but he&#39;s
not a villain he never took anything for
himself didn&#39;t have any fancy clothes
fancy jewelry and he wore the same metal
watch for the elastic band after dad got
arrested he couldn&#39;t find work lost our
apartment we&#39;re officially homeless
everything we own now fit inside two
grocery bags we ate out of a cooler and
we read comic books by flashlight and it
was at this time that I discovered the
scariest word in the English language
tomorrow
fear of tomorrow became my lullaby shame
became my shadow and I thought the only
way to protect myself what&#39;s the highs
my shame away two years go by my dad
comes home
you know I got some great news I got a
job that&#39;s great
yeah right it&#39;s turning 11 right by your
school we&#39;re all your same thing up
yeah and that shame crept up inside me
only this time it transformed itself
into rage I roamed through life looking
for fights hiding from my shame didn&#39;t
didn&#39;t help fighting getting others to
what else was there 3 a.m. one night I
can&#39;t sleep so I head to 7-eleven I see
my dad through the window and before I
could rethink the timing of it all he
sees me are you crazy what are you doing
out here this late dad I just wanted to
come by get in here right now right now
kids a day sit down I want to tell you
that I&#39;m sorry I know dad I&#39;m sorry
you&#39;re sorry
there you go ahead I interrupt you I
want to tell you that I&#39;m sorry for the
way things turned out you know
everything you missed out on so are you
had a dad that went to jail all your
other friends dads are out there and
they ask suits and you you got a dad
that works here
I know mijo I&#39;m not stupid I know okay
and I&#39;m sorry
I look around the 7-eleven place I&#39;ve
been ashamed of the man I&#39;ve been
ashamed of and I see a stack of comic
books by his desk that I know he&#39;s
bringing home to me so that in his eyes
I can learn from real heroes but in my
story heroes don&#39;t wear capes
my hero wears a smock and that metal
watch at the elastic band and forgotten
that while I was busy trying to forget
who I was that night was the first time
we ever talked about what we&#39;d gone
through the first time we&#39;d ever shined
a light on and by shining a light well
hell nobody could solve a problem in the
dark
maybe ninjas can I don&#39;t know what he
ninjas so I can&#39;t tell you I don&#39;t know
him but in that light I saw my dad
that&#39;s all myself now I didn&#39;t go to
school the next day and say hey my dad
works for 7-eleven in the life starts
right here ladies no I think I just done
I stopped hiding I stopped fighting and
eventually I even stopped putting mousse
in my hair if you&#39;re hiding or fighting
from your shame or if you&#39;re staying at
a friend&#39;s house tonight just so you can
eat shine a light on your story own it
share it
and let others know that outside these
impossible walls of our shame the air is
breathable and we don&#39;t ever have to be
afraid of tomorrow thank
[Applause]
