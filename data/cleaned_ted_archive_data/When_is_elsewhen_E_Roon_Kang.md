I was working on a project in Korea last
year
regarde festival which my studio was
providing designs for and because of the
fiscal distance between Seoul and New
York
we were having video conferences almost
every day and these calls I had to
happen in odd hours for everyone either
very early in the morning or very late
in the night and one of the main curator
of the event was my friend and
collaborator tha who was also based in
New York like myself working remotely
most of the time and one day we were
complaining we sat down and start
complaining about how our professional
lives were happening in odd hours as
well as our personal lives were
happening in what whereas our personal
lives were bound to New York&#39;s local
time which created our lives much more
complicated it was almost like we were
floating in someplace else in between
Seoul in New York and not completely
belong to either of those two places and
similarly in our perceptions these
conference calls were not happening in
New York or Seoul&#39;s local time but
possibly else when a unique time-space
that participants from both places
create and share momentarily time is
based on the movement to planet Earth
because we consider that as a constant
the speed of how the Earth rotates
itself and around the Sun and it&#39;s
convenient to think of time in this way
because it registers every event into a
single and linear metric system and it&#39;s
like an assembly line your phone calls
and email communications and just about
anything it&#39;s bound to this completely
linear framework and we rely on this to
define order and what&#39;s really
interesting about this linear experience
is that it has a very definite beginning
and an end time on a personal level is
unquestionably a finite resource you can
accumulate infinite amount of wealth but
you cannot have infinite life
and I think this is the motivation
behind every technological advancement
to maximize our use of time so that we
can do more things in less amount of
time and as a result the contemporary
world operates in terms of global
synchronization things happen in real
time and the semblance of simultaneity
is a defining characteristic of value
and it&#39;s a synonym to efficiency but as
a human being it&#39;s not uncommon to feel
detached from the real time when you&#39;re
jet-lagged and can&#39;t fall asleep in the
middle of the night or missing a subway
stop while daydreaming these happen when
you&#39;re by yourself not thinking
perfectly with the GMT the green each
mean time
and while Tien and I were having
conversations like this what we also
realized was that there&#39;s no such tool
available for us to measure these
personal perceptions of different times
these senses are essentially ephemeral
as soon as we look at your watch then
boom you&#39;re back in sync with the GMT so
what we wanted to try was to give form
to this personal and ephemeral senses by
conceiving a new measurement system that
could capture your personal senses then
perhaps we could create a time device
that would display your personal times
so that you can interact with it without
thinking back to the GMT then perhaps we
could think about the network of these
devices and think about how we negotiate
these personal times from person to
person
then perhaps we could create an
alternative time system a consensus time
the bottom-up approach towards deciding
what time it is now as opposed to the
top-down approach where we&#39;re basically
being told by the geopolitical standards
so in other words what we set out to do
was to create a completely new time zone
that is not based on the movement of
planet Earth but based on your personal
perceptions of time and for the past
year we have been conspiring on this
subject and
recently we just finished our latest
experiment in our Los Angeles County
Museum of Art which was also the very
first to use customized custom-made
hardware and software to capture the
participants personal movements and this
is the personal timekeeper it&#39;s a simple
plot with one button that displays your
personal time and it comes with the
little pamphlet that is describing what
is encouraged and discouraged while
using it for the day and we handed out
these devices to the participants and
then everyone gathered around in the
same place at the same time and we asked
them to close their eyes and press and
hold the button for a span of time that
they thought was a minute which could
actually be anywhere in between 30
seconds to 90 seconds and then from that
point on everyone&#39;s Clark would advance
in different speed depending on their
perceptual minute going faster or slower
and everyone wore these devices and they
they explore the museum and we asked
them to come back to the place where we

started by 3:30 p.m. which of course
would no longer be a single point in
time for everyone and while the
participants were experiencing this
detachment from the GMT for a few hours
we set up a website that displays their
personalized times along with their
markings of moments whatever period of
time that they thought was significant
to them and then using this using this
subjective history of personalized times
and their markings of moments we
initialized a roundtable discussion on
how we could possibly model a consensus
time or shared time space among
participants that they created together
so the thing that is interesting about
having a device that helps you measure
moments is it and then as soon as I
press the button it kind of made me more
attentive to what I was experiencing and
observing in that in that moment my
clock was really fast super super super
best so I decided just to try to do as
much things I could to know in order to
tries to see something like what time
are we supposed to be here you said
three o&#39;clock consensus time has to be
expressed in contemporary time units I
mean can we just call it like rainy
afternoon time what we normalize is the
waiting parameter but I don&#39;t need to be
synchronous everyone all the time if
you&#39;ve ever been in a relationship I
want to know when you&#39;re having a moment
you know because if there was a way of
just like stretching it or squeezing it
but in manipulating it so we can ease
back into so what if we&#39;re looking for
something that&#39;s not actually there no
so in the current model of GMT time
manifests as a single and uniform
backbone to everything that happens it&#39;s
the ultimate unit of measurement that
everyone has to share but I think we can
take back our ownership of our sense of
time as opposed to just simply giving in
to the conforming standards of time and
we can create a new logic for keeping
track of time
maybe we selectively synchronize our
personalised times with small number of
people like our friends and families and
co-workers from time to time and then
drift away
this idea of not conforming to the
standardized time could feel a little
far-fetched but it&#39;s a step towards
recognizing and respecting the vastly
different in beautiful ways of how we
all navigate through this complicated
world thank you
