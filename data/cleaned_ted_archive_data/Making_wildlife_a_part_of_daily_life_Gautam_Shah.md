so I&#39;m going to talk about games let&#39;s
go ahead and start by playing one all
you have to do is make the sound of the
animal that you see on the screen behind
you sound okay
[Applause]
all right very good so the correct sound
is at least that&#39;s what the tortoise in
my garden always seems to do you knew
these sounds instinctively right even
you&#39;ve known them since you were two and
they&#39;re probably the first sounds your
children will learn our childhoods
revolved around animals our toys our
books our music our movies they were all
associated with animals and whether it
be a cow or a lion animals touched our
hearts but as we grew up as we grew up
other things started to take our
attention whether it be sitcoms or video
games or boyfriends or girlfriends and
along the way here we are facing the
extinction of our natural world but
there&#39;s good news there&#39;s still evidence
that wildlife captures our imagination
movies like Zootopia and Jungle Book had
a hundred million viewers each 800
million people last year visited zoos
and who doesn&#39;t like a video of a
sneezing panda bear on YouTube
we&#39;re fascinated by wildlife and animals
but with so much competing for our time
we can only pay attention in short
bursts and short bursts don&#39;t have
lasting benefits my personal love affair
with wildlife started in Chicago of all
places I grew up in a woody suburb where
foxes and raccoons and deer would
fascinate my sister and I every day and
I never outgrew that it actually got to
the point where I started spending all
my holiday and all my salary seeking out
personal experiences with grizzly bears
or chimpanzees or penguins but it got to
a point where it all started to feel
very selfish these experiences were only
for me and animals were still dying I
didn&#39;t want to spend another 20 years
sitting behind a desk as an IT
consultant and taking these great
vacations
so I quit my perfectly good job and
decided to get into wildlife
conservation one of the first things I
learned was that there&#39;s two ways that
we currently use primarily to engage an
audience with wildlife the first is
traditional fundraising and the second
is ecotourism and both of these only
reach a limited audience either they
already converted or the small
percentage that can afford an experience
like this and meanwhile there&#39;s people
on the ground fighting tooth and nail to
save a Pangolin or save a bonobo or save
a southern right whale conservationists
are fighting really hard but let&#39;s face
it they&#39;re behind they&#39;re not catching
up and another world elephant day isn&#39;t
going to turn the tide if you&#39;re behind
you can&#39;t keep playing defense you have
to switch to offense and offense in this
case means aggressively competing for
your attention based on what your life
looks like it means finding ways for you
to want wildlife in your life not just
telling you that you have no other
choice the sectors that are the most
successful are the ones that have
people&#39;s attention every day we need the
same number of people to pay attention
to wildlife let&#39;s pay attention to TV or
politics or sports so I want to ask you
what would it take for you to every
morning first thing
reach for your mobile phone to find out
what&#39;s going on with elephants and
anteaters because if we can figure out
the incentives to make that happen
then maybe those elephants and anteaters
will compete with Game of Thrones and
Lionel Messi and Donald Trump as topics
at dinner time this is what&#39;s necessary
for wildlife conservation to take its
rightful place at the table as one of
the most important things in our life we
have an idea that&#39;s combining three
ingredients that we think could make
this happen
first is individual stories continuous
news about the deaths of anonymous
elephants thousands of miles away are
sad but they&#39;re too abstract it&#39;s
individuals too
whether they be human or animal to
capture people&#39;s attention just look at
how the world reacted to Cecil a lion
with a dramatic story and a name second
is a channel that already has people&#39;s
attention games two billion people spend
an average of six hours a week playing
games imagine or what if you could pay
attention to the life of manyara the
elephant in Tanzania but in a more
interactive way than enough than another
boring newsletter what if you could
compete against your friends on trying
to predict what manyara might do next
what if you could compete against
manyara to see who could take the most
steps and get the most fit what about
rather than searching through your home
city for a fictional Pokemon you are
searching for manyara games have a
negative connotation because they can
addictive just a small percentage of
those billions could get addicted to
wildlife
lastly we used real data as the final
ingredient what you&#39;re seeing here is
the actual movements of manyara the
elephant in Tanzania and because of
Technology there are literally thousands
of animals currently transmitting this
data we partner with the organizations
that are collecting it to bring these
stories to your mobile phone in the form
of games and we in turn take the revenue
from those games and give it back to
those organizations so games that use
GPS data to bring the stories of real
animals to your mobile phone and let you
play along could that combination get
you addicted to the life of manyara or
leuco the bear or Wilson the Jaguar
that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to find out it&#39;s
not the only way and it&#39;s by no means a
short success but there&#39;s no time left
to play defense we need to find this and
other ways to create 20 million
forty million a hundred million wildlife
addicts could you be one of them we&#39;re
currently developing these games and we
need your input so Google Internet of
elephants and let us know what you think
and let&#39;s all celebrate the life of
these animals and not just mourn their
death thank you
[Applause]
