hi there is so much data in science
today and much of it is beautiful like
this my favorite picture of the Orion
Nebula you can see behind me but in
astronomy in biology in particle physics
we&#39;re collecting data a lot faster and
faster all the time and some people say
that we&#39;re in a data deluge with
drowning in data but we&#39;re not we need
to embrace data we need to learn how to
handle it and one way to do that is mass
participation in science it&#39;s
crowdsourcing we break down the big
scientific questions into small
digestible things we can ask any member
of the public and the public has the
time the public spent 1.2 billion hours
playing angry birds last year if we can
harness some of that time and use it for
science we can do something amazing and
that&#39;s what we do at the Zooniverse we
make websites where we show people data
ask them questions about it and then we
get science done for us this started
with galaxies we need to understand the
shapes of galaxies to know the history
and the history of the universe but
computers cannot reliably tell us this
information and so in 2007 we took a
very large survey of galaxies we place
them on the web and we asked everyone to
help us look through them and tell us
what their shapes alike and it was a big
hit in just over a year 100,000 people
helped us classify a million galaxies
it&#39;s amazing it was such a big success
and it&#39;s still going several years later
it&#39;s called Galaxy Zoo by the way hey we
asked people lots of questions now we
use more data and they&#39;re still
contributing to science real papers all
the time and we&#39;ve expanded we&#39;re
helping other researchers to do their
work as well these images come from
snapshots Serengeti a project where we
ask people to look at data from
automated camera traps in Tanzania and
they have to tag any of up to about 50
different animal species and tell us
what the animals are doing something
computers cannot do but which is quite
good fun really it&#39;s animals on the
internet after all
and it&#39;s speeding up ecology for these
researchers they couldn&#39;t get through
this data we have increased their scale
similarly in medical research we have a
project called cell slider where we ask
people to look at a naanum eyes medical
research data and have to look for
patterns in the colors and shapes that
they see and this helps cancer
researchers investigate the nature and
consequences of breast cancer until done
in a web browser there are about 30 of
these projects in this universe but we
get something for free by doing this
which we didn&#39;t expect at first we don&#39;t
just get people&#39;s clicks and their time
we get their curiosity as well these
objects you see behind me a little green
peas as they were called by the users of
Galaxy Zoo who saw them in 2008 over and
over again while they were using the
site and began to discuss them and forum
online shared them they teamed up they
called themselves the Peace Corps they
look them up in online databases and
they learned more about these objects
than we were ever telling them they
realized they found something cool they
didn&#39;t know what it was and the first
time they came to us and encountered a
paid scientist in the whole endeavor was
to say we know he found something
interesting but what is it and we were
really happy to tell them they
discovered an entirely new type of
galaxies in the universe that had to be
seen by human eyes to be unusual but
once we know it&#39;s there we can find them
all this is amazing to me this is part
of the future of science mass
participation and involvement of
everybody we have a million people
participating in our projects now and
they&#39;re giving us their time and their
efforts and we&#39;re getting science done
faster we&#39;re doing it better and we&#39;re
opening the door to serendipitous
discoveries made with the help of the
whole world thank
you
