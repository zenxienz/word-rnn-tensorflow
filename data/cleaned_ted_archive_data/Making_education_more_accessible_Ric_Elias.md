I wasn&#39;t born in the United States I
moved here from Puerto Rico when I was
17 got a great education and eventually
started a company that now employs 1600
people I am living the American dream
let me tell you about my friend Roberto
Roberto is 20 years old and he wasn&#39;t
born in this country either he moved
here from Peru when he was a young kid
and Roberto dreams of living the
American dream
four years ago Roberto was graduating
from high school at the top of his class
but he wasn&#39;t going to college he was
destined to work in the same kitchen his
father works
that&#39;s because Roberto has a secret our
country is the only home he&#39;s ever known
yet we call him an alien he&#39;s never done
anything wrong yet
we call him Olivo because somewhere
along the way we decided that it was
okay for kids like Roberto to pay the
price for crimes they did not commit
imagine putting a kid in jail because
his or her parents robbed a bank while
they&#39;re sitting in the back of the car
that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing to these kids by
conservative measures there&#39;s 1.1
million undocumented students under the
age of 18 in our country today in less
than 5% of them will ever go to college
not because they don&#39;t want to but
because we made it nearly impossible for
them to do so
because if you&#39;re an undocumented
student in our country it&#39;s illegal for
you to attend public university in one
of these three states because if you&#39;re
an undocumented student in our country
you don&#39;t qualify for in-state tuition
in any of these 38 states
because if you&#39;re an undocumented
student in this country you don&#39;t
qualify for federal financial aid in any
state sadly if you&#39;re an undocumented
student your American Dream ends in
grade 12 what we&#39;ve been debating
immigration reform for the last 12 years
under the DREAM Act we have left
another million undocumented now young
adults fall through the cracks without
education and without hope but this is
not an immigration issue this is a human
rights issue because we have a gap in
our system a gap that keeps innocent
kids in poverty this year an additional
80,000 kids will age themselves into
that gap it&#39;s ironic because we pay for
this kids primary and secondary
education but then we cut them off
politics aside that&#39;s just bad business
this is what inspired us a group of
friends to form Golden Door scholars
it&#39;s a non-profit group that tries to
help undocumented kids go to college we
partnered with seven private
universities on a fifty-fifty basis so
their funds could go twice as far and in
one month with one local press release
we got 487 applications most of these
kids are all American in every measure
but one we met with we reviewed 487
applicants phone screen the top 40 and
met in person with the top 20 our goal
was select to select the top five but
that proved to be impossible
in August there&#39;s 17 kids there&#39;s 13
kids I&#39;m sorry we&#39;ll attend college for
the first time their future one in at
grade 12 in exchange for an education we
ask of them one thing that when they
achieved their success they agreed to
pay it forward for someone else in need
of education but every day since we have
since we decided on who was going to
college I have thought about a young
woman in Durham North Carolina named
Jackie Jackie was our final cut
Jackie&#39;s a 4.7 GPA Jackie is a volunteer
Duke&#39;s Children&#39;s Hospital Jackie&#39;s
doing everything right
everything I hope my kids do when they
are that age Jackie is not going to
college and there&#39;s something
fundamentally wrong when 20% of all
engineering and technology companies in
our country in the last 15 years
count with an immigrant founder yet we
made it make it nearly impossible for
Jackie for Roberto to become the next
Sergey Brin if you&#39;re wondering about
Roberto three and a half years ago my
wife and I decided to pay for his
education
this May he graduates from the
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
with degrees in computer science
chemistry and a might and a minor in
math thank you
[Applause]
