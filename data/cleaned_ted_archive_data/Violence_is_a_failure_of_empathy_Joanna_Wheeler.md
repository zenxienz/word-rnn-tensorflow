violence causes trauma all over the
world and I&#39;d like to talk to you about
how people telling their own stories can
stop violence in their lives and in the
lives of others most of us would prefer
not to think about violence most of the
time but for people who live in urban
slums for example they don&#39;t have this
option because violence is in every day
in your face
kind of reality maybe one of the reasons
that we don&#39;t like to think about it is
it&#39;s hard to see what can you contribute
to a solution when the scale of the
problem just seems so big dota is a
young man from a township in Cape Town
and he&#39;s smart and he&#39;s funny and he&#39;s
really articulate and he&#39;s also a former
gangster former drug addict and prison
inmates I&#39;d like to share with you the
story that in DotA told a couple of
months ago in DotA was raised by his
grandmother after he was abandoned by
his mother who was an alcoholic and he
loved his grandmother very much and when
she died he felt like he had lost the
only person in the world who cared for
him he ended up on the streets
robbing stabbing and eventually going to
prison and when he was in prison he
decided that he wanted to come out and
be someone that people trusted again and
so when he came out of prison he started
to work with spunky gender justice in
Cape Town going and speaking to small
groups of young men in his community
about how to stop violence now the
easiest thing for in dota would have
been to go straight back to his old life
because frankly he doesn&#39;t have very
many other opportunities but he&#39;s trying
to stick to his commitment commitment
even without knowing if his story is
going to have a
the ending so DotA&#39;s story is not about
the moment when he was in prison and he
decided to change and go to story is
about how he has to hold on to that
commitment every day even when it&#39;s hard
why doesn&#39;t Otis story matter the
current response to violence is bigger
bigger police forces bigger prisons
higher walls longer sentences stronger
militaries and these things they may
help but they&#39;re not enough and there&#39;s
something that&#39;s missing from this
solution for a lot of people in the
world violence comes from a place that
you least expect it it comes from a
friend a parent a police officer or a
lover and yet there are people like in
DotA who are willing to stand up to the
violence in their own lives and the
lives of others I work with stories I
help people to tell their own personal
stories using their creativity and their
experiences as a reference and then
using technology to amplify what they
have to say and once people have been
able to tell that story that powerful
story that they have they can tell it
over and over and in doing that they&#39;re
able to take hold of their own story and
change it and I&#39;ve worked with many
people around the world to do this and
I&#39;ve really learned a lot from them and
I want to share with you what are some
of the elements that help people to use
their stories to stop violence and the
first one is this it&#39;s space
when you live in a really violent
situation you don&#39;t have time to sit and
ponder the meaning of violence in your
life because you&#39;re too busy trying to
survive you&#39;re worried about the fact
that your roof is leaking and you don&#39;t
have enough money to buy food and you
need someone to watch your kids so that
you can go and get a job and what you
need is a safe space where you can take
a step back and look at your life
through a bigger perspective and try and
understand what that violence means to
you truly is a young woman from the
township in johannesburg and a friend of
mine and she was raised as a child and
after the rape her parents didn&#39;t want
to talk about it she didn&#39;t want to
think about it she was just supposed to
move on and it was years later in a
storytelling workshop when Trudy was
able to go back to that experience and
think about not just the rape but what
it had meant to her and what she could
do about it
and now to me helps other people to tell
their stories and she&#39;s really good at
it and she uses her experience of having
told her own story to help other people
to tell theirs and so when you&#39;re in
this safe space and you can tell your
story the second thing that you need is
recognition so you&#39;re sharing your story
and it&#39;s about something that&#39;s really
hard what you need is someone who&#39;s
sitting opposite you saying I see you I
hear you and you matter
it&#39;s that recognition that sense that
someone is acknowledging what your
experience has been it helps people to
be able to tell those stories now this
point goes far beyond just storytelling
if you think about violence in general
it&#39;s about a lack of empathy take for
examples of Balkans you have people
who&#39;ve been friends and neighbors for
years suddenly start killing each other
in really terrible ways and this was
partly about a failure of empathy it was
about no longer being able to see one
another as a mother a father a brother
or a sister and seeing them
ah and then and once you get us and then
divisions you can justify almost
anything and so what we need is to put
the entity back in and that means you
have to be able to connect to someone as
a person and this is what stories help
us to do because people in telling their
stories are putting themselves into the
story and that breaks down these kinds
of assumptions and it helps connect be
people beyond rhetoric and that&#39;s
element number three connections so when
you&#39;re telling your story about your
commitment try and stop violence the
fact that there are other people who
have that same commitment who are
willing to take the same kinds of risks
it makes it easier for you to do the
same and this is again a point that goes
way beyond storytelling we need to get
people from the favelas of Rio and the
townships of Cape Town and Ferguson
Missouri to be able to connect to one
another and I&#39;m talking about the direct
connection of people who are working at
the grassroots who really understand the
problems that they&#39;re trying to face and
it can be done in many ways it can
happen through online forums you visit
exchanges and workshops but what&#39;s
what&#39;s important is that it&#39;s about a
quality connection I was working with a
man named Sauron in Bosnia and he was a
soldier in the war and eventually became
a translator in the piece and I was
working with him on social projects and
we were doing a storytelling project in
Bosnia and it was for people to tell
their own stories of how they&#39;ve made a
change in their community and what has
been hard about that and at the end of
all of this
I asked Thorin you know what did you get
out of this work and what he said was
what he had gotten was the sense that
there was a whole nother world out there
of people who believe that they can make
a difference and are trying to make a
difference first in their lives and in
the
of others and that he could be connected
to them and that&#39;s what the storytelling
process can help people to do is to make
these connections so where does this
take us I&#39;ve been talking about the
elements that help people to stop
violence in their own lives but what
about in the lives of other people well
there&#39;s two that I&#39;d like to share with
you and the first one is about the small
seemingly very ordinary everyday types
of acts that are really needed to stop
violence so sometimes stopping violence
is like standing in front of a tank but
most of the time stopping violence is
about the small ordinary things that add
up to make a much bigger change and what
the storytelling process helps people to
do is to recognize what those things are
to see them differently it&#39;s about like
invisible threads that connect violence
into our lives so I was working with the
Mannings I&#39;ll see it from a favela here
in Rio and he&#39;s a community leader and a
brilliant music teacher and we were
watching two young boys who were playing
with model replica wooden replica guns
and they were having a gun battle over
the tops of some cars and he turned to
me and he said I tell their parents
don&#39;t let your kids play with those guns
because it isn&#39;t play it&#39;s practice and
in the context of the favela he&#39;s
absolutely right those would be real
guns shooting real bullets in a couple
of years at the most and so it was a
storytelling process that helps all
feared to be able to see that something
is innocent as children&#39;s games in the
street is exactly what needs to be
changed to get a solution to violence
but I think there&#39;s something else that
stories help us do which might be even
more important and that&#39;s about being
able to stand up for negotiation and
dialogue
so when everything is about to kick off
when the situation is about explode
explode what you need is someone who can
push pause who can get people to stop
and start talking when they&#39;re ready to
start shooting I was working with a
group of activists in Croatia which is
another township in South Africa and I
asked them how do you go out from your
Shack into your neighbours Shack and
stop a man who&#39;s about to beat up his
wife how do you do that and the answer
was we go in and we start talking and if
they kick us out we come back we talk to
them some more if they don&#39;t like it we
keep talking and in fact we keep talking
until we get them to listen and this is
what we need we need the people who can
take those kinds of risks who are able
to get the husband to sit down with the
wife to get the gangs and the police in
the same room to get governments and
terrorists to talk to one another so all
these elements are really important for
how people are able to stop violence in
their lives because in telling their
story what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re
taking hold of the narrative of who they
are and they&#39;re changing it and that&#39;s a
really powerful process I have seen
people use their stories to do really
amazing things I&#39;ve seen them tell their
friends and communities and families
things they were never able to speak
about before I&#39;ve seen them go to a
policymaker who just didn&#39;t want to
listen and cut through piles and stacks
of reports straight to that person&#39;s
heart and get them to pay attention I
have seen people use their stories to
get their governments to stop and listen
there&#39;s no guarantee with this approach
every person who tells their story is
not magically going to become an
activist although it would be nice
and there are plenty of people out there
who haven&#39;t had this opportunity who
really should and really do need to tell
their stories but I think that the
process of telling your story and spark
something powerful and stories can show
us a different kind of a way think how
different the responses of the
government of police departments of
crime prevention units peacekeeping
forces think how different it would be
if they really took this commitment that
people had to try and stop violence in
their lives and the lives of others
seriously so in Gerda and truly and
Thorin and all feared and many others
like them have had the courage to tell
their own stories and in doing that they
have rewritten a lot of how we see them
they have rewritten how they see
themselves and they have changed the
possibilities for what they can do it
may seem like a very small thing to
listen to their stories but I know them
and I can tell you it&#39;s not a small
thing at all it&#39;s actually really big
and in listening to these stories what&#39;s
happening is that we can recognize the
courage that they&#39;ve had we can
interrupt the cycle of violence we can
contribute to a solution thank you
