wilderness cannot be restored or
recreated only destroyed we are just
about to lose our last glimpses into
prehistory that connect us to Eternity
and remember a time before modern man
every year we pole ourselves across the
Okavango Delta in northern Botswana
these two hundred and twenty mile
research expeditions take a cuss take us
across a wilderness beyond comparison
visible from space the Okavango Delta is
the largest alluvial fan of its kind fed
by floodwaters from the mighty calving
goo basin the size of Texas the world&#39;s
largest undeveloped river catchment home
to the largest remaining population of
elephants on earth keystone populations
of lion leopard hyena wild dog giraffe
buffalo and cheetah depend on africa&#39;s
next unesco world heritage site but why
why do we risk our lives every year to
cross this remote wilderness were there
two reasons first to undertake and
completes the most comprehensive
biodiversity survey ever undertaken in
this remote wilderness we do this during
the receding floods when all wildlife is
concentrated onto the main channels we
are using this is the only way we can do
this over nine years we&#39;re doing this in
essence to benchmark US wilderness so
that we can notice any significant
changes in the future
should the catchment change second to
share the human experience in this
remote wilderness what began as an
expedition blog uploaded via satellite
has become a mission to convince people
millions of people around the world to
protect and preserve wilderness they
will never visit
the BAE people arrived in the mid-1700s
they&#39;re the custodians of the mother
Okavango they arrived with a
revolutionary new technology the mokoro
an 18-foot dugout canoe that would
forever change our human experience in
this remote wilderness the Iron Age had
arrived the digital revolution they&#39;re
still coming over ten years thousands of
miles purling with them across the
Okavango we were accepted as by AE River
Bushmen we can now navigate a secret
path into a remote wilderness known only
by them and us who know Makawao
by a gala there are no foreigners here
only by AE as by AE we enter that
wilderness barefoot unarmed with minimal
food rations and no possessions as
digital Bushmen we arrive with hundreds
of pounds of batteries solar panels
satellite dishes tablet computers apps
and modern technology in theory Okavango
org is an effort to reinvent the process
of surveying mapping exploring and most
importantly sharing these remote
wilderness areas with the world
immediate real-time access via an open
API to all of our research data to our
biometrics things like our heartbeats
what we&#39;re seeing what we&#39;re hearing our
comments directly involved scientists
data artists programmers school kids
around the world they can interact with
us that&#39;s all we share these experiences
this is a simulation of data being put
into our system and represented live
online we have unearthed ologists in
England going through our research
helping us publish very very quickly I
just imagined
following us as we go into a remote
wilderness and explored wilderness on
the other side of the world this is us
going down a crocodile-infested channel
all the water has gone dead animals in
the water dead crocodiles probably
killed by this one a 15-foot Nile
crocodile it was to turn around and come
back at us if they had ciliary
accelerated against the current we were
surrounded by the abundance of life our
Apple effort had not died on us this is
another crocodile trying to get away
this large crocodile is coming at us
thinking we&#39;re another one I pulled over
to the side brace for impact and
surrendered to the wilderness hard
stopping to say the least but a lesson
in what is important I dedicate my life
to the preservation of wilderness for my
son Jack wild boys thank you
