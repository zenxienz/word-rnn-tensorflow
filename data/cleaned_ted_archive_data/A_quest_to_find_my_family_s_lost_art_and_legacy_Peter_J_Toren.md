my father is a great storyteller when I
was growing up he loved to tell stories
about his family some true and some not
so true I think it was because he and
his brother were the only only members
of his family to survive the Holocaust
the last time my father saw his parents
was one week before the Nazis invaded
Poland on a train station in Brest lout
a city in eastern Germany at the time he
was 14 years old his brother was also
put on a Kindertransport but to England
and my father didn&#39;t see him for another
eight years apart from two photographs
that we have with my father with his
parents we have no other photographs and
no other physical possessions but that
is beginning to change and we are
learning a little bit more about my
family&#39;s history all because of art
looted by the Nazis probably my father&#39;s
favorite story was about his uncle uncle
David Friedman uncle David who owned
10,000 acres of sugar beets and had a
distillery my father described Uncle
David as a kindly yet imposing man who
powdered his head and like to give
lavish parties for German intellectuals
he also reputedly had the largest art
collection in Breslau all stolen by the
Nazis to me hearing these stories uncle
David was never a real person after all
nobody in our family had ever seen any
pictures of him and I certainly never
expected to get back any of the art in
the freedmen collection the possibility
that we may actually recover some of his
art first surfaced about four year four
or five years ago when we uncovered a
letter in nineteen written in 1939 to
the secretary of economics in Berlin the
letter listed items in the freedmen
collection including works by Gustav
Colbert Pierre Pizarro and other famous
painters it didn&#39;t list many of the
paintings by name however it did list a
painting called two riders on the beach
by the German
jewish impressionist max liebermann in
my father remembers the painting hanging
in the sunroom of uncle David&#39;s villa in
Breslau mainly mainly because he spent
hours there on Kristallnacht waiting for
his father to arrange the for sale of
the villa to a famous nazi nazi general
he was waiting there to bring my
grandfather his father warned closed
because he was being sent to a
concentration camp for the first time in
november of 2013 the prosecutor in
munich announced the seizure of 1,200
works of art from Cornelius Gurlitt
whose father Hildebrand was Hitler&#39;s
principal art dealer the office probably
would not have disclosed it but for a
whistleblower and it&#39;s likely that the
art net the prosecutor&#39;s office would
have simply returned the works to
Cornelius Gurlitt but for the
whistleblower to avoid any adverse
publicity the press conference in the
seizure were widely reported throughout
the world including on the front page of
the New York Times that featured a
photograph of two riders we immediately
claimed the work as belonging to us
despite the evidence we are forced my
firm was forced to bring suit against
the German government to force them to
return the painting to us since then we
have also uncovered additional
information about 54 other works of art
as belonging to David Friedman including
one the basket weavers that was sold by
the German auction house villa griesbach
on behalf of Cornelius Gurlitt sister
apparently without conducting much in
the way of due diligence unfortunately
not everybody has been supportive about
my family&#39;s quest to obtain the stolen
art some German newspapers have reported
that we were in it only for the money
because we sold the work so soon after
we got it back indeed the money was
substantial was over 2.5
five million dollars but the real reason
is much more mundane half of the work
half of the painting belonged to my
uncle&#39;s family and short of cutting the
painting in half and allowing each
family to keep one horse there was no
way we can no practical way we can keep
keep the painting what is really
remarkable about this story for my
family is that how it&#39;s offered for the
first time an understanding of my father
his family in his history before we
began the process his fat his history
was like a blank canvas but the freedmen
paintings tells story and that story
begins to tell the history of my family
something that I can tell my children
and something that my father could never
do for me now give you one small example
we were recently contacted by a 90 year
old woman who whose aunt worked for
Uncle David in breast Lao and what is
simply outstanding about it is this the
woman read about the story of the two
riders in the paper and she actually
remembers visiting uncle David in his in
his villa in Breslau before the war and
not only that she has photographs of
Uncle David in his and his daughter
Charlotte who&#39;s also killed by the by
the Nazis and she sent these photographs
to us and this is the first time that
anybody in our family has ever seen
photographs of Uncle David and in
Charlotte and what is even more amazing
is that uncle David looks almost exactly
like my father and he was blind in his
80s and my father my father is blind so
the coincidences are truly remarkable
and this is the story in our quest for
the stolen painting has really created
an opportunity for us and filled in a
canvas of my family&#39;s history that was
blank up until now and we will continue
our quest for more of the art so we can
fill in the remainder of my family
history thank you very much
