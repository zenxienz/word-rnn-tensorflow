gentle satire can you stand it um okay I
have my aunt Bonnie lives in Seattle
Washington and she spent like thirty
five years as an inner-city low-income
school psychologist in a high school and
she&#39;s the most wonderful person and I
just love her and we&#39;re really close and
every time I go to Ted she says when you
get in the car to go to the airport I
want you to call me and I just want to
hear it fresh from you I just want you
to tell me how it all was so when Chris
asked me to do this I realized that the
only way I could really do it was to
pretend that you were all my aunt Pawnee
and I would tell you how Ted went this
year I would start out and I would say
Oh Bonnie when Ted starts first of all I
just feel so happy because I am finally
among my people my people my people are
Nobel laureates and venture capitalists
and philanthropists and really high tech
people and professors of science at Ivy
League universities these are my people
finally I am with my peers
it is not those people I left back home
that husband who keeps bothering me to
get my receipts together so we can do
our taxes or my daughter who just wants
a ride to ballet class and some money no
these are my people Bonnie and I see
people here and it&#39;s like to me they&#39;re
like huge celebrities like I saw like I
just saw Matt Ridley on the first day
just walking by to me that it&#39;s like
seeing Brad Pitt I wanted to run up and
say the Red Queen the Red Queen is the
greatest book and it makes me so so
excited um the Ted the Ted thing started
the first guy he his name was Robert
Gordon and he came up and he had this
kind of long sad face really cute though
like kind of an impish sad monk kind of
look and apparently there&#39;s no more
growth growth is dead
we had no growth for 800 years then we
had a little spit of 150 years where we
had a lot of growth thing now apparently
Bonnie there&#39;s no growth so I&#39;m thinking
we should not go to Hawaii this year
like this it&#39;s terrible even though I&#39;m
not even I don&#39;t really understand
exactly why growth is so important but
it really seemed bad but then this other
guy came up from MIT and he said that is
totally wrong there&#39;s so much innovation
and there&#39;s gonna be so much more growth
in that I was so happy in the trip to
Hawaii was back on there&#39;s growth but
then he did say that because of machines
and robots and everything that the
blue-collar causes are going to collapse
and have nothing to do so that&#39;s a side
effect
then though then this guy came up I
think he was another MIT guy another one
of my peeps
and he had this huge robot it was this
giant robot and it had like a faith and
he showed us how this robot working in
collaboration with people is going to be
able to pick up things almost almost
pick up things with the help of the
person who&#39;s standing there sometimes
two people you might need so initially
the blue-collar workers will have more
jobs
and run fewer jobs oh my god
and then bono was there you know from
you two and he says he gets aroused by
fats that was very exciting for me to
think about I thought oh my god I could
really saddle up to him and say Oh bond
o ciock MC squared percentage of the
round and maybe he would oh the other
thing that bono did this is what I love
about Ted he tells you about a horrible
problem poverty in the world so then you
feel really bad then he tells you that
you&#39;re we&#39;re making all this incredible
progress towards ending poverty and then
he tells us that we are individually are
responsible for it yay so you find out
about a problem you find as being salt
and you&#39;re the solution to the problem
fantastic and there are so many great
scientists who were so excited about
their animals the squid lady there was a
lady who was so excited about squids she
goes to like a squid summit every year I
mean who knew that this kind of didn&#39;t
even existed and it really made me think
there needs to be more scientists like
her because she realized that the probe
that they were sending down into the
deep ocean that has the most horrific
sound that she played for us for like
thirty seconds it was so eerie
might not be the best way to drip fish
and her genius idea was to maybe not do
that and put a probe down there that
fish would like
um oh my god and speaking of my peeps
but on my first day when I got here I
met this woman who works with dolphins
she was working with dolphins in the
Bahamas for 28 years and I had seen the
documentary on PBS or something I don&#39;t
even remember what but I watched it and
so I knew exactly who she was and it was
so exciting and there she was just me
part of my tribe kind of the people I
hang with oh and there&#39;s this guy who
won the TED Prize
I&#39;m Sagada Mitra and he has gone around
the world and he just puts computers in
a hole in the wall and in places where
people don&#39;t even know English and kids
don&#39;t know anything and they just
learned neuroscience they just yeah he
gets grandmother&#39;s from England to just
say oh how did you do that
even though I have to say I think if I
put a computer in my daughter&#39;s room
who&#39;s 13 and she didn&#39;t know to computer
with I think she would look at it for a
very long time and then become aware
that she could see her reflection in it
and put on some lipstick and then lay
down so I don&#39;t know oh my god and also
Bonnie there are so many young scientist
genius scientists like there was this
kid who&#39;s like 11 who made a fusion he I
don&#39;t know which came for his fission or
fusion but he went into the garage and
he did this thing that is like
impossible and now he&#39;s gonna solve the
world&#39;s energy problems because he&#39;s
gonna build this nuclear reactor
underground and he uses like nuclear
reactor waste from other things that it
was so fantastic and then he came on the
next day and he had solved this problem
with pancreatic cancer or prostate
cancer and oh and then there was this
kid from Nairobi who figured out how to
save the cattle and save the lines and
they were so cute but then thank God
these two gorgeous young girls who were
in high school in Vancouver got up and
they found some bacteria that eats the
fail aids that are the terrible thing in
plastics and I think we&#39;re gonna get
together and Ted&#39;s gonna put some money
together and they can create a new race
of children together and I think the
girls should get to choose and it&#39;s not
just amongst those young boys I think we
should throw in the sleepy man banjo
band boys need to pick from there was
this guy Oh Bonnie okay there&#39;s this guy
he&#39;s like a saint
he&#39;s like a modern saint he&#39;s he&#39;s this
guy in Africa he goes undercover to the
most horrible horrible horrible places
he exposes the most incredible terrible
things in prisons and like you know
Hawaii knows who were getting their
parts if their arms dropped off and he
can&#39;t show the way he looks because he
has like a death warrant on him so he
came out wearing a plate of spaghetti on
his head
and it was so distracting to be watching
these horrible videos and then there&#39;s a
guy wearing two hats and I got so
worried for him part of me thought you
know I can help you with disguises if
you need a disguise
I am your gal and then he kept busy
couldn&#39;t really see he kept walking to
the edge of the stage and like started
getting so nervous I thought this guy
survived being in prisons his ins is he
survived and now he&#39;s gonna solve this
Asian guy attack
oh and then there&#39;s all these artists
there was this really great guy this he
had shaky hands and then he realized
that the shaky amp thing worked in his
favor and he created all this incredible
art and it was all about accepting your
limitations and he was so great and then
there was this other Chinese artist who
makes himself become invisible and all
these different situations and he was
great and then there was this other
woman who I think we&#39;re out of London I
think she&#39;s from China but she&#39;s like
this designer and she showed it first of
all she had the most fantastic shoes on
I&#39;ve ever seen anyone wear and secondly
she showed us these pictures of her
designs and I have to say Barney I have
become a communist because after seeing
those pictures of those children&#39;s rooms
I was so horrified that anyone would
design a room for children that the way
that it&#39;s just funny to me that it&#39;s
it&#39;s a Chinese person to turn me into a
communist and oh my god there&#39;s this guy
his name&#39;s Elon Musk I know it&#39;s not a
perfume I&#39;m wearing Elon Musk right now
anyway he he&#39;s like a perfect Ted person
because he&#39;s like you know he started by
I&#39;ve never even heard of so many of
these people and he you know started
PayPal and made a zillion dollars and
then he did Tesla what he&#39;s doing
electric cars and then he started like a
space you know a rocket ship and he
showed us the big achievement you can
make a rocket go off and then it comes
back down and we watched it it took a
very long time and we watched it and
everyone now can see my peeps understand
how hard that is and like if you showed
that in the regular population they&#39;d
think oh that just the rocket just came
back when I up and came back I guess
that&#39;s very hard you know and then there
was a guy who showed us this duck and
this duck died and then another duck
came up and started having sex with it I
guess this is like a common thing like
animals died and he was trying to do
these theories about it and mr. Duquette
oh this is the thing that really stuck
in my mount mind about the dead duck the
duck tried to have sex with the dead
duck the live duck had sex with the dead
for an hour and 15 minutes to me that
was the most astonishing part of that
entire thing what&#39;s not even and then I
can thinking there&#39;s some joke in there
 a duck dead duck I don&#39;t know what
it is but there&#39;s something there and
then I&#39;m finally oh oh I know oh my god
Bonnie Stuart brand okay Stuart brand is
this guy right he wants to bring these
species back to life and there&#39;s these
organizations that first of all Bonnie
I&#39;ve heard about I&#39;ve heard about
organizations you can&#39;t imagine like the
International Society of people who are
here voices Association that exists well
Stuart brand really is interested in
having these extinct species come back
and there&#39;s like societies like the
bring back the passenger pigeon Society
but house meetings and conferences
and he wants to bring back like the
passenger pigeon or like the woolly
mammoth and I was thinking really the
woolly mammoth I mean like where&#39;s the
woolly mammoth gonna go I mean maybe you
should start you know like a little
something a little easier maybe bring
back Leonard Skynyrd start with stings
trainee or maybe just the holders
catalog because you know we miss it we
miss it Oh Bonnie I wish you could have
been there all right thank you very much
[Applause]
