good afternoon everybody
I&#39;m a blogger I&#39;m from Madagascar and my
name is Rosa melena
so today I&#39;m gonna talk to you about
connection on blogging and on Madagascar
the island and the main continent so we
are plugging in French so we got the
connection with Global Voices Hutu in
translation of what we talking in
English and in France and doing the the
all good connection of the the issue so
what we talking on a blog so we I got no
I just free three minutes but I&#39;ll show
you some picture of what you talking and
the picture we talk themselves so this
is what the global dose is what about
war our community of plug-in that is my
country so is the world four largest
island in the in the world it&#39;s been
isolated from Africa over 100 million a
year so I have to go fast this one quick
the widget is a vegetation and animals
in Madagascar unique so me many species
in known when you say Madagascar then
people say oh it&#39;s going to be maybe to
be with you fool or something so I will
show you some picture of Madagascar this
is the lime lime stones each natural
placed Oracle stones they in the north
of Madagascar and this is our Manhattan
so this is all all them the milestones
so it&#39;s natural this is a worm our
Avenue so it&#39;s a baobab Avenue in South
of Madagascar so this is the sunset we
see on top of Madagascar this is our
animals this very place toric the unique
we can maybe can find them just only
Madagascar
then in sometimes the animals are unique
so of the gorillas see nothing there&#39;s
the lemurs then hundred percent houses
in Madagascar then lemurs then the last
find they just find this may be the the
new the new discover lemurs is a they
don√≠t
name of the man who&#39;s who found it it&#39;s
American and just translated in Malaga
so the why they call it the stars it
means good man then now the thing is
it&#39;s beautiful but when you see this you
think it&#39;s sunshine but now it&#39;s a it&#39;s
a blow it&#39;s blowing now in Madagascar so
people just burn it and don&#39;t have any
control of the the fire so if they they
just have the bicycle they even they can
this day they don&#39;t have fireman for
aeroplanes for stopping the the burn so
it&#39;s just going and be faster and all
the country so when you see when you
flame I mean Madagascar so you maybe
have a chance to see something like this
so is to burn from the plane then when
you see a view from the satellite so
they did I don&#39;t know if you see by if
you take it on an Ethernet we you see
the the real subtle satellite picture so
there is many many red the red light on
it so it&#39;s not the light the New Year
now first not all converted but it&#39;s
fired in the it&#39;s fire in Madagascar
then Madagascar 2,000 years ago was
green like this so 50 90 ball I don&#39;t
know but now if they just in this just a
little bit left of the rainforest
so the people they can do nothing about
it just watching and waiting until the
the fire stopping they they do it for
for growing the land and stabilizer the
liver I&#39;d lost my mobile what can I do
mean the the issue is the I&#39;m very happy
to be a part of this state as a fellow
but the thing is a I air many of our
brother who can solve the the problem in
Madagascar day I heard they can do the
so so so and solar energy I heard one
whose country in the water I had many of
our brother in Africa so I think we can
do it ourselves and don&#39;t leave
Madagascar we are we are part of Africa
thank you
[Applause]
