I&#39;m infatuated with this concept of
impossible
so infatuated that I have made it my
life&#39;s mission to make things not
impossible and the way that I go about
doing that is this mashup of Technology
and story technology from me my past
life as a producer was this space of
animation and design and graphics and
things that came out of a computer but
in a 3d way or a 2d way but now the
world that I play in now is technology
but it&#39;s technology for the sake of
humanity and what that means is how do
you take something and crack it open and
modify it and zip tie it or duct tape it
back together and maybe reprogram it in
a way so that it accomplishes a
fundamental social and human need and
the way that I go about doing that is
that once you create that then you make
it accessible to people right if you
make something that no one has access to
it then what&#39;s the point so then we try
to get that out there as much as we can
write the story side I look through this
lens called help one help many and what
this means is if I said to you guys
today who here wants to help me cure
hunger who here has a clue how to do
that you&#39;re like wow yeah um yeah you do
good let&#39;s talk after this that&#39;s big
right that&#39;s really really big but if I
said hey when I was coming in - it was
cold and there was a guy outside and he
looked hungry looked like he needed
something to eat let&#39;s everybody chip in
a buck everybody put a buck and a hat
and let&#39;s go buy the guy&#39;s sandwich now
we&#39;ve helped one person but maybe we put
in a couple bucks now we can buy a
couple sandwiches more sandwiches for
people and that&#39;s how it starts to
spread you help one person and then it
starts to spread them many so the lens
that I look through when any project
that I&#39;m about to take on I look through
this lens of who is the one who&#39;s the
one person I focus that story on that
can then help many many people so I&#39;m
out to dinner and a friend says hey you
got to check this guy out him
dr. Tom so I went home and I researched
him and what I found out about this guy
is he&#39;s this doctor in the Nuba
Mountains which is this area between
Sudan and South Sudan and he is the only
doctor within a 1,500 mile radius and he
literally does everything from deliver
babies to appendectomies if it&#39;s medical
he&#39;s the only guy who can do it and so
I&#39;m learning about this guy and later on
in the article it says you know the one
thing he hates to do is to perform
amputations which begs the question why
is he performing amputations and what I
learned is the area of the Nuba
Mountains especially the area where he
is in is constantly being bombarded by
President Bashir the current reigning
President of Sudan and what he does is
he runs this campaign of terror over the
public there and he bombs them with
rolling these 55-gallon drums filled
with jet fuel and shrapnel out of the
back of these big turbo prop planes all
right it&#39;s horrible they hit the ground
they make a crater shrapnel goes flying
everywhere and so if you&#39;re in that path
of the shrapnel not doing so good
so because of that there&#39;s foxholes
everywhere people will jump in into
caves but they&#39;ve been system and then
when the dust settles people come out
and they carry on about their day but
there was one particular amputation that
dr. Tom had to do and he talked about a
young boy named Daniel who was out
tending his family&#39;s goats and cows he
heard the bombers come and he was out in
the field so there&#39;s no place for
there&#39;s no foxhole to jump in and so he
wrapped his arms around a tree that was
closest to him the bomb went off not far
from him the tree protected his body
from the blast but that blew off his
arms and so I&#39;m reading this story I was
like oh and what got me is what he said
when he woke up he realized that he was
now an armless Sudanese boy and it&#39;s
hard enough to stay alive incident with
arms and he said if I could die I would
because now I&#39;m gonna be such a burden
to my family look everybody here has
experienced despair before but can you
imagine actually wanting to be dead
because you don&#39;t want to be a pain to
your parents
so I&#39;m reading this is all happening at
my kitchen counter and I&#39;m reading this
and just down the hallway these guys are
asleep right my guys and I couldn&#39;t
imagine them waking up with thats that
feeling of like I wish I was dead so I
have a process and my process is you
commit then you figure out how the heck
you&#39;re gonna pull it off and I read this
and I saw this about this young boy
named Daniel and I said I got to do
something I don&#39;t know what but I got to
do something so the way I work and the
way I kind of look for things is I start
to go wait a second
didn&#39;t I just I read something or I did
something about that and we had just
done an article about this carpenter
this brilliant carpenter in South Africa
accidentally cut his fingers off in a
table saw accident and he had the 3d
print fingers for himself and I&#39;m like
okay wait so if that guy&#39;s printing
fingers maybe we can kind of come over
and we could use that finger thing to
make an arm thing for Daniel maybe
there&#39;s something there so that&#39;s what I
call when you see things that are
tangential or relative to what your
problem is that&#39;s what I call morsels of
permission you look for little morsels
and bits and bobs here and you start to
pull those together and put them all
into a pile and that&#39;s your end solution
so I invited all these brilliant people
to my house people way smarter than
myself and we started to explore
different ways that we could make an arm
for Daniel and we play it around with
with different types of plastic we
played with 3d printing we played with
even balsa wood and the result of the
weekend was a gigantic failure nothing
worked
here&#39;s what kind of failure was a friend
of ours came over and she was missing a
left arm we printed her a right arm
that&#39;s kind of that gives you a taste
test of kind of how that weekend went so
I was going right I&#39;m going and Richard
the carpenter who had cut his fingers
off and actually generously come out to
help us and he said me I don&#39;t think you
should go i first of all you don&#39;t know
what you&#39;re getting yourself into
sedan is gnarly and you are gonna be a
big tall bald shining target walking
around and he goes and there&#39;s this
thing you don&#39;t have an arm there&#39;s that
thing - he said you&#39;re still going
aren&#39;t you and I said yeah I gotta go
I&#39;m going tickets are bought I&#39;m going
he goes all right I figured you&#39;d say
that so here&#39;s the deal why don&#39;t you
come to my place in South Africa I&#39;ll
teach you how to 3d print I&#39;ll teach you
everything that I know and then if
you&#39;re ready then off you go and I said
I deal so hopped in a plane I was
petrified because when I got on the
plane I didn&#39;t know how to 3d print I&#39;m
going to Sudan to make to make something
for this boy who I&#39;ve never met before
but I&#39;d never made it before but I&#39;m
getting on this plane so here we go
Geronimo I hop on I go to Richard&#39;s
place he teaches me everything and it
teaches me how to 3d print he teaches me
how to work with hands he teaches me how
to work with amputees and kind of the
details of of the fingers and and how
everything works and he teaches me and
so we&#39;re the guy here we go it&#39;s working
he shows me how to do it so I say
goodbye to his family I hopped on a
plane I land in Sudan that&#39;s not the
plane
otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be in front of you
right now I land in Sudan and the
organization that&#39;s with us take us over
to the dis little shed that they that we
called home and we just started to work
right we just started to work and we
kind of cleaned it up and started
getting set up and we started to print
and we started to make the mold of the
arm for Daniel and we started to to kind
of figure out how it would work and how
it would fit and I was nervous because
I&#39;m like I&#39;ve never done this before
home I got it you know there&#39;s a thing
in carpentry you measure measure twice
cut once I&#39;m measuring seven times in
cutting ones and we go through this
process and literally everything that
could go wrong did the you guys know how
3d printing works the filament was
actually it was so hot was melting to
itself before it got into the 3d printer
the bugs were dive-bombing the printer
and jamming up the printer everything
was gonna lecture s&#39;ti was surging
everything was going on but every day
we&#39;d wake up and there&#39;s Daniel he&#39;s
like what&#39;s up how&#39;s it going big shiny
tall guy and so we just kind of kept
pushing through it and then four days to
the day that I read the article about
dr. Tom we made an arm for Daniel and
Daniel fed himself for the first time in
two years
and thank you
and it was awesome it was awesome to
watch him be able to now have that
independence but we didn&#39;t show up just
to help Daniel right it&#39;s how do you
make this how do you make this bigger
how do you have many people so we didn&#39;t
have a lot of time left but we started
to teach some of the locals in his
village how to how to use these printers
and I I started to teach them and they
never seen a 3d printer before right and
we taught and we kind of pushed him
through all this stuff and I ended up
having to get on a plane to fly back to
Los Angeles and when I got on that plane
I&#39;m like I hope it works but I didn&#39;t
have enough time with them is it
actually going to work and I landed back
in Los Angeles and I got off the plane
took me four days to get back I landed
and I turned on my phone and dr. Tom and
sent me an email he said hey hope the
trip back wasn&#39;t too wasn&#39;t too bad but
you&#39;d be psyched to know while you&#39;re in
the air two more arms were made and I
was walk I&#39;m walking through LAX just
like dad yes people are kind of looking
at me as they&#39;re walking their kids in
their strollers by and the crazy thing
is that we ended up creating the world&#39;s
first 3d printing prosthetic laboratory
most arms cost 15 grand the Daniell arm
cost a hundred bucks right and it&#39;s
cheaper now and how did we pull it off
and why did we pull it off we found our
one right
we found our one so the question that I
asked you guys today in that concept of
of help one help many who&#39;s your one and
who is your Daniel so thank you guys
