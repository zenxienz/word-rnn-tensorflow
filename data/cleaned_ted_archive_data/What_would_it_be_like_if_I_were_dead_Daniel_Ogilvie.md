well inside when I was a child I
sometimes wondered what it would be like
to be dead I think that&#39;s why it was so
popular as a kid I mean fun to be around
imagine myself in in a in a coffin my
body lifeless and I was cold and I was
lonely I was desperately lonely I
wondered if that feeling would ever go
away so I asked a Sunday school teacher
what was about heaven he said you&#39;re
going to love it it&#39;s it&#39;s like a picnic
that goes on forever with your friends
and loved ones a backyard barbecue that
goes on forever and and that that image
didn&#39;t appeal to me much how long would
it take for me and my loved ones to get
on each other&#39;s nerves and so okay great
I I think maybe it was maybe four or
five hours into eternity and I would
have had it and and and and then what
well gradually I became suspicious
skeptical about the package of beliefs
that were being handed to me by my
family&#39;s religious community and I just
went on with life these thoughts came
back to me about 30 35 years later when
I my four-year-old daughter came
charging out of her bedroom down the
staircase she was only four years old at
the time and she was crying and through
her tears she said in front of her
mother and me I don&#39;t want to be a thing
that dies but I I don&#39;t want to be a
thing that dodge breaks your heart done
it
yes awfully young age to be confronting
the tragedy of life she was calling out
for help and I was tempted to tell her
to shut up and go to bed because I was
she made me a little nervous but but her
mother came to arrest you and she said
don&#39;t worry dear you have a long life
ahead of you and she gave her hug
miraculous her body just immediately
calmed down now I think in our country
and other religious territories around
the world a more likely response would
be don&#39;t worry dear God will take care
of you and that&#39;s one of many platforms
for later discussions about God the soul
and afterlife now you know you know the
story and that is as you for as you saw
your religious line that what profits
tell you to do that then you&#39;ll end up
in a good place you go into this kingdom
of heaven forever but if you assemble
along the way you might not get there
immediately but you&#39;ll get there
eventually and if any if you don&#39;t obey
the rules if you&#39;re unrepentant sinner
then you&#39;ll go to eternal damnation now
these are not taught to kids as ideas
you know these are facts this is the way
it is and and and when facts of that
magnitude are internalized there is
surrounded by their particular by
feelings the guard dogs of those
feelings and world views and begins to
sort the incoming mail so that views
compatible to that where the world views
they&#39;ll just stick they&#39;ll be looked at
for reassurance worldviews that tend to
undermine it or pushed aside ignored and
sometimes even attack a candidate for
that would be Darwin&#39;s theory of
evolution and in some cases tragically
it&#39;s science now I got I got interested
in this near the end of my career I&#39;m
not personality in social psychologists
and and fortunately I had a colleague
named Glenn Hamilton has a brain
scientist and we put together a course
on the topic of the causes and
consequences of solo hasta los feliz it
was an exciting course because it forced
us to open up don&#39;t go into history and
philosophy and areas of our own
psychology and put together an
interdisciplinary course we became a
almost a featured course at ruckus now
the course is finished my colleagues
retiring i&#39;ma Belton follow his
footsteps but we uncovered some really
interesting phenomenon and I want to
have the opportunity to keep these ideas
alive and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here keeping
these ideas alive this is a wonderful
venue for that a couple examples I want
to examples I want to give you is why is
it so easy for kids to accept and
understand a whole idea that there&#39;s a
soul and there&#39;s an afterlife well yet
to explain why they accept that they&#39;re
told to accept it but people who are in
charge of their survival so it has no no
choice but how do they understand it
this is interesting
the way they understand it is they
already suspect that something is going
to survive their death go back to me and
my coffin I said I was cold and that I
was lonely in other words sort of
intuited that my senses would continue
on and my emotions and I my thoughts
they would continue on now you say well
that&#39;s because you were weird fella well
it turns out I was in pretty good
company I&#39;m livid weird in other ways
but I but here&#39;s some research from the
lab of jesse bering in in ireland kids
are shown a little puppet show there&#39;s
my part as a mouse mouse is the field
mining its own business and a hungry
alligator comes by crunch crunch crunch
kids it&#39;s the mouth yet yes are you sure
yes it&#39;s all broken it&#39;s all chewed up
dozen else miss its mother yes there&#39;s a
mouse get cold at night yes does a mouse
get hungry yes even though they know
that the mouse mouse can&#39;t eat Paul
bloom that year university right
brilliantly about he talks about
children&#39;s natural dualism like
naturally separating physical things and
and and and psychological properties now
quickly to another level of thinking
though human beings have have this
incredible capacity to be two places at
the same time you know you&#39;ve already
done that you you know you&#39;re sitting
here and you&#39;re singing what I&#39;m going
to have once you see yourself out there
having much later tonight I&#39;m going to
take a flight back to to the east coast
and I can see my eye here I can see
myself getting on the airplane
and looking for the right seat and
getting it wrong and having to be moving
okay so I&#39;m there but I&#39;m now I&#39;m back
here that&#39;s how we get through the day
isn&#39;t it we&#39;re always thinking and
preparing for the next step
so I think that&#39;s what happened to my
daughter she was lying in bed thinking
about mental time travel her her
traveling self came went too far and
came back with the very bad news which
is good that it what it was age for so
this is when it developed we&#39;re not born
with its capacity the brain needs to
mature particularly the frontal lobe and
the prefrontal lobe and that system gets
connected with the visual system because
when you imagine yourself you actually
see yourself there once it&#39;s set to go
that age for that&#39;s that the good times
roll can imagine going to a birthday
party going to a playground and this
time are taking the big kids flawed
catching a game-winning touchdown pass
one hand being on text giving a TED talk
dying it&#39;s a shocker filled with dread
not with my daughter it was don&#39;t worry
here you&#39;re going to have a long life
ahead of you but you see how a soul
beliefs an afterlife is a more perfect
solution yes you&#39;re going to die but not
really because you&#39;re continuing on now
throughout history particularly our
ancient ancient ancestors religion was
good for us for good help them survive
because it got them the common believes
common rituals common initiations bonded
them to the tribe really important it
was not a good idea to walk out in the
savanna alone you need to have that
connected to your band or your tribe and
and then nature return the favor
by developing brains our brains that
allow us to be in two places at one time
to think ahead then to plan and then as
we came more and more organized in
mostly agricultural communities the
emergence of priesthood emergence of
rulers of chiefs who said you know you
not only need to behave yourself in this
particular way because this is the way
God wants you to do it or the Gotham to
do it they only make you a good member
of your tribe but also will allow you to
move into heaven and if you don&#39;t behave
yourself into hell no I I mentioned that
these are our long-standing beliefs once
they&#39;re installed whether you want it or
not they&#39;re still there they still have
an effect on what you think and what you
believe even though you&#39;re not even I&#39;ve
been aware of it now I ask you to do
what I ask my students to do and that is
sort of knowing that there&#39;s different
perspectives different views different
beliefs and I noticed that people with
different beliefs you know what they
don&#39;t like each other lots of wars are
fought fought over this issue or
justified that&#39;s a big concern for me
and so my solution to it might not
solution might approach to it is have
people my students and I asked you to
talk about what you were told to believe
about the soul when you were young stir
what you were too and have that
conversation with other people talk to
them about what is a what what did we
what we&#39;re taught to believe and in that
way we&#39;re revisiting something that we
learn years and years and go in
and still control us and it loosens up a
little bit you have different
perspectives gives us a broader
perspective and you may discover that
what you&#39;re told to believe no longer
fits what we know about the world to
encourage you to do that and you may
even be able to follow the lead of my
life who said she directed the
conversation to the joys the sorrows to
the beauty and the awesome opportunities
of this voice so engaged in this
conversation do it for me do it for
yourself and do it for the well-being of
our planet thank
