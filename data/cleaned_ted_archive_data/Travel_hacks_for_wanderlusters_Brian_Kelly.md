air travel these days is just not what
it used to be at least that&#39;s what I
constantly hear from friends and in the
mainstream media harsh stories of
crowded planes with surly flight
attendants making travel these days all
but unbearable I can&#39;t count how many
times I&#39;ve heard the phrase the golden
age of air travels behind us but is it
really I&#39;m here today to give you four
reasons you might want to consider
otherwise first off air travels cheap
fares have actually dropped 40% since
the industry was deregulated in the u.s.
in 1978 in 1955 it will cost you one
hundred and six dollars to fly JFK to
Los Angeles on TWA when adjusted for
inflation that&#39;s eight hundred and
ninety six dollars and did I mention
that that was an economy today you can
fly jet blues new business mint class
for five hundred and ninety nine dollars
on that same route and a live flatbed
with your own individually closable
suite secondly new technology makes air
travel faster connecting the globe like
never before
emirates will soon take home of the
world&#39;s longest flight dubai two aqua
new zealand non-stop an astonishing
eight thousand eight hundred and twenty
four miles and over seventeen hours in
the sky in 1960 that same journey would
have taken you five individual segments
over two days and with new composite air
airplanes it makes travel on your body
much much better and unlike in the
golden age of travel you don&#39;t have to
worry about sitting next to a
chain-smoker second air travel is also
much much safer than before in 1962
there were 42 accidents per million
takeoffs in 2014 there were just one and
I&#39;d also like to argue that air travel
these days is much more comfortable
which will go back to that last slide
now I&#39;ll admit airlines are packing
people into the economy cabins but I&#39;d
argue that since air fares are actually
dropping and air fares have been
unbundled you can now pay
for the space that you want or for
upgrades and in the front of the cabin
things are indisputably better last year
alone I took four showers at 40,000 feet
in the sky that&#39;s what you see there on
the right it&#39;s safe for work don&#39;t worry
and I wasn&#39;t paying tens of thousands of
dollars for these tickets in fact each
of those flights I spent less than $100
cash out of pocket by maximizing my
frequent flyer miles
so as the points guy I&#39;d be remiss not
to give you all three tips on how to do
the same now first things first
diversify even though they&#39;re called
loyalty programs sleep around a little
bit the airlines can and will change
these programs but there is still value
there but just like your investments you
want to diversify so when one program
makes a negative change you can leverage
a different program secondly and this is
a great tip is leverage partners so
airlines have Alliance partners and
other airline partners and often these
are the very best deals out there take
for example my flight home from Ted this
week I&#39;m flying Cathay Pacific&#39;s life
left business class for 25,000 American
airline miles and 39 bucks not bad for
two thousand dollar ticket the trick
here is that that flight never will show
on a a.com so never trust airline
websites even though it&#39;s 2016 and you
think these websites would work picking
up the phone and calling can yield the
very best results now when I actually
put in Vancouver to New York on a comm
it would have routed me through Chicago
doubling the amount of miles and time so
even in this day it makes sense to call
and see about partners now thirdly if
you&#39;re using cash you&#39;re losing cash
it&#39;s all about the credit cards these
days in 2016 more airline miles will be
created from credit cards spend then the
airlines will actually give for flying
so it&#39;s all about getting a good credit
card that gives you valuable miles you
pay off that bill in full every month so
you avoid the interest and you win by
maximizing everything you can on the
credit card in general miles are
currency I want you to think of them as
valuable so whether you&#39;re an
entrepreneur
your bottom line can improve researchers
your field possibilities brought in and
charities your global impact can
increase so to recap
air travel these days is cheaper faster
safer and more comfortable that sounds
like the Golden Age of air travel to me
thank you
