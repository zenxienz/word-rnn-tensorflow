I was 10 years old when I played in an
orchestra for the first time this wasn&#39;t
my elementary school orchestra this was
me with a bunch of high school kids I
had only been playing trumpet for about
two years when I had only been playing
trumpet for about two years and it was a
scariest thing I&#39;ve ever done in my life
my mom even had to sit next to me and
help me count my rest and rhythm so I
wouldn&#39;t mess up but I loved it I loved
playing in an orchestra there are 15
different instruments all playing at the
same time and although one of us could
play louder than the entire group it was
our responsibility to work with one
another and blend so we could best
communicate the emotional and musical
ideas of the composer growing up and a
big family of 10 and a low-income
neighborhood there are plenty of
opportunities for me to leave the path
of success my friends were making all
sorts of bad decisions that would change
their future trajectory but my parents
worked really hard to provide me with an
environment where I could grow and
thrive what made the difference for me
was music see music played at a really
really high level helps to build the
executive functioning skills and
character that one needs to turn
day-to-day stress into daily moments of
success by learning all of your skills
it helps you to expand your memory by
even observing the silence and music or
rest as we call them it builds
inhibitory control by perfecting your
technique it provides you opportunities
to also sharpen your level of focus and
to be able to do all of that with a
hundred other musicians playing at the
same time while focusing in on your
individual part that simply helps to
build more flexible attention and these
are all skills that you learn the moment
you begin playing music although I
wouldn&#39;t need my mom&#39;s help after that
first year playing in the Youth
Orchestra I would rely on her support
more and more as I grew interested in
becoming a professional musician
my musical mentor is in high school
helped to prepare me to enter the most
selective college in America the Curtis
Institute of music there with the full
tuition scholarship I was able to play
the staples of the orchestral and
chamber music repertoire with
world-renowned conductors and musicians
just about every week I even had the
opportunity to travel the world and play
in the best concert halls throughout to
Europe Asia and the Americas but the
more I went on that path to become a
professional musician I really lost
touch with what brought me to music in
the first place that connection with the
other musicians around me and of course
the profound connection that you can
have with the community so in my last
semester at Curtis dr. Jose Antonio
Abreu won the TED Prize and in his
speech it made me reflect about my
musical journey a year after that I
found myself in his office in Venezuela
preparing for a two-month tours of his
programs throughout the country and he
said something that made a really really
big impression upon me that culture for
the poor should not be a poor culture
that was a guiding philosophy of my
childhood and that would become the
guiding philosophy of play on Philly
this photo is one of our students
performing in Verizon Hall in
Philadelphia one of the finest concert
halls in the world and standing in front
of them is the music director of the
Berlin Philharmonic Sir Simon Rattle now
I&#39;ve had the chance to rehearse with
maestro rattle several times but I never
had the opportunity to perform with him
publicly
let alone perform for a sold-out
audience in verison hall so as I watched
our students perform I was thinking play
on Philly as a program that&#39;s not only
giving these kids exactly what I
received as a young kid but it&#39;s also
giving them lots of opportunities that
I&#39;ve yet to have so culture for the poor
should not be a poor culture it cannot
be a poor culture so that means that we
all
the responsibility of providing the best
instruments for the poorest kids we must
provide the best teachers for the most
vulnerable kids and continue to provide
the best musical opportunities for the
most marginalized kids and like my mom
did with me we need to sit next to every
single one of them and help them count
the rest and rhythms until they get it
thank you
so Stanford real quick you went through
the emotional and cognitive benefits of
the program but how does it affect
academic success so as we see in our
research comparing kids that spend the
same amount of time after school doing
academic tutoring where sports are at
your curriculars what we have seen is
that our kids are a letter grade ahead
in every academic subject and it goes
back to when you teach a kid to memorize
more information or focus for a longer
period of time control inhibition that
yes we see grades go up we see behavior
problems go down and that our kids 100
percent of them have gone on to college
and RFC&#39;s versus normal 60 low 60
percent for Philadelphia and about 20%
of those graduate from college so the
jury is still out on our kids getting
through but we think they&#39;re equipped
with the skills to get through college
thanks
