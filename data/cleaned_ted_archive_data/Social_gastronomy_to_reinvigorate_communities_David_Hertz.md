in 2004 I met with Adele
she&#39;s 19 years old she came from a
dysfunctional family I did not believe
in her potentials she dreamed of having
the same rights as well for Brazilians
she was jobless and had little skills
imagine leaving my place at 53 percent
of the people had already felt hunger
favelas are informal settlements in
Brazil where the state has little or no
power
it&#39;s a place ruled by the influence of
drug trafficking with a lack of job
formal employment with a lack of formal
employment fear and Prejudice are
everywhere a place most of us never dare
to go when I was 19 I wasn&#39;t really
comfortable with who I was and in order
to discover my true potential
I went try VAR on the world I lived in
more than 10 countries which lasted for
seven years I lived here in Canada and I
was amazed by the social equality I
returned to Brazil I still hadn&#39;t found
myself but I came back passionate about
people places and especially food
cooking became part of my daily life it
brought me presents creativity it
connected me to my roots it connected me
to nature gastronomy became the
guideline of my life opportunities began
to rise I felt I had a talent but I
couldn&#39;t embrace any of them it was only
when I accepted myself as being gay that
I felt free for my own prejudice my fear
my hate and I was able to honor my past
I felt them really empowered I was so
lucky that I was invited to take place
in Brazil first ever culinary program
for chefs in the year of 2000 I loved it
I went there to learn all the cooking
techniques but what I got the most out
of it was that by interacting with other
people you learn so much about yourself
confidence discipline collaboration so I
became a chef I run the business and I
start to ask myself what&#39;s the question
behind all of this the answer to that
question came when I visit a favela I
thought to myself what if I got all
those people to get involved with
cooking
what if through cooking they can become
what they&#39;re meant to be in that moment
I decided to dedicate my life into
turning gastronomy one of the most
powerful tools to empower people and
create bridges between the different
social realities in Brazil that&#39;s what I
call social gastronomy with that goal in
mind I co-founded an organization to be
the foundation for the social movement
which I&#39;m so passionate about
we started by offering free culinary
programs for the Vantage youth who most
of the tide didn&#39;t even have money to
pay for transport transportation for
seven years we have trained over 1200
trainees all employed in restaurants at
good wages and during and after that
training they are encouraged and taught
to go back to their communities and
become multipliers bringing workshops on
how to cook and how to use health
ingredients to mothers and children
social gastronomy travel Beyond Borders
I have used the favelas an example of
social exclusion but partnering with
government or other organizations were
able to bring hope to all the group of
people who have been left behind such as
prison inmates or jobless immigrants by
inviting people who have never dare to
go to a favela we&#39;re able to engage them
and inspire them contributing to build a
more holistic society a new approach a
new understanding to food
these people that had never had a say
are cynically able to have a voice Judea
she has become a mother and an
entrepreneur she employs more than 20
people a month with her catering company
she found a place in her heart of love
of forgiveness that no difficulties can
take away her commitment to live with
joy and pride
so social gastronomy is this movement to
help you accept themselves to support
them to recognize their unique essence
it&#39;s for people to embrace a community
to generate gratitude
that&#39;s the transcendence of this
movement it goes beyond one chef one
meal one Michelin star what I&#39;ve learned
is that when we are all connected we can
feel love and respect and with food we
can transform millions of lives thank
you
