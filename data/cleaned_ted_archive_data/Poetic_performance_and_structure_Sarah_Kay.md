I think they just couldn&#39;t figure out
what session to put me in but I&#39;ll take
it so that since this is the design
session she asked me to do this poem
because it says as close to
contemplating design as I have in a poem
probably and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a love letter
and it&#39;s a love letter from a toothbrush
to a bicycle tire so the name of this
poem is toothbrush to the bicycle tire
they told me that I was meant for the
cleaner life that you would drag me
through the mud
they said that you would shred all over
me that they could see right through you
that you were full of hot air then I
would always be chasing always watching
you disappear after sleeker models that
it would be a vicious cycle but I know
better I know about your rough edges and
I&#39;ve seen your perfect curves I will fit
into whatever spaces you let me if
loving you means getting dirty
bring on the grime I will leave this
porcelain home behind I&#39;m used to twice
a day relationships but with you I&#39;ll
take all the time and I know we live in
different worlds and we&#39;re always really
busy but in my dreams you spin around me
so fast I always wake up dizzy so maybe
one day you&#39;ll grow tired of the road
and roll on back to me and when I blink
my eyes into mourning your smile will be
the only one I see
thank you so great Sara thank you I tend
to think of actually I think of poetry
as the most designed of the literary
arts and I just would love to hear from
you is that how I mean the pooping aside
is that how you think about poetry in
terms of structure and infrastructure
and building it out well I think there&#39;s
I mean there&#39;s no right way to think
about it and there&#39;s no wrong every poet
will tell you different but certainly
the structure of a poem oh is what
allows you to communicate whatever idea
or feeling or emotion or story or moment
you&#39;re trying to create so that poem for
example there&#39;s a lot of structure
involved in creating it and all of those
little puns are building blocks that I
had to shift and shape to make sure that
the story was told a certain way so
structure definitely plays into it for
me but there are plenty of poets that
come to structure secondary and hit
images first and it&#39;s it&#39;s way more
sloppy than I think okay and I hear
there&#39;s more good news and you have a
book that&#39;s just oh oh yeah I have my
new my first collection of poetry came
out yesterday and it might be even here
that&#39;s right there are free there
totally free coffees at the bookstore
you just have to go pick one up but
because they&#39;re free don&#39;t take like a
handful just take one so that other
people can have them too but anyone can
have them yes oh and tonight because of
the book they&#39;ve they&#39;ve let me have a
little room and I&#39;m going to just

perform some foams tonight so at 9:30 if
there&#39;s not a hundred other parties that
you&#39;re already obligated to I&#39;m going to
be doing poems in the Pacific Rim Hotel
screening room everyone wants to hear
more all right so okay thank you thanks
you
