ah
well that&#39;s a nice way to wake up isn&#39;t
it
normal we all had scrappy to wake us up
in the morning most of us however have
mornings that are a bit more like this
we&#39;re out of five of us live in cities
at least in the developed world and we
love cities they give us jobs they lower
our environmental footprint but they
also increase our anxiety levels and our
levels of stress so what do we do about
that take two hours of this and call me
in the morning oh actually can we just
back that up again because we have some
answer a couple slide issues so let&#39;s
just go back to the let&#39;s go back to the
city bear with me yeah four out of five
of us live in cities four out of five of
us live in cities in the developed world
for ya should we go back to the traffic
jam
I just really wanted to see that sunrise
again so most of us actually have
mornings that are more like this we&#39;re
out of five of us in the developed world
live in cities and we love cities they
give us jobs they lower our
environmental footprint but they also
increase our levels of anxiety and
stress well there&#39;s a remarkable new
treatment that can lower our stress and
anxiety can increase our concentration
focus creativity and memory can reduce
our need for strong painkillers speed
healing and lower the amount of time we
spend brooding on negative thoughts
sounds pretty good doesn&#39;t it just take
two hours of this and call me in the
morning now funny thing is most doctors
at least here in the West don&#39;t
prescribe nature as a treatment um it&#39;s
just not something that that they that
they prescribe you know but honestly do
we need a doctor to tell us that
nature&#39;s good for us do we know this
intrinsically already well yes but few
of us seek it out regularly as therapy
ninety percent of our time at least here
in North America is spent indoors eight
hours on the computer on our smartphones
before we know it the days gone by we&#39;re
back in the car and well maybe well
tomorrow we&#39;ll take that sorely needed
walk in the park but what&#39;s so special
about getting a nature fix let&#39;s check
out the visual aspects first one theory
posits that and nature scenes appeal to
our basic survival needs it&#39;s an
evolutionarily derived natural aesthetic
that reduces our stress more than say
looking at modern buildings do other
theories suggest that it&#39;s the curves
contours and context of nature scenes
that invite our minds to to free play
instead of fixate and fatigue and it&#39;s
that visual romping around that
rejuvenates us
so let&#39;s why don&#39;t we um dive into the
brain and check out what researchers
have been finding there so using
functional magnetic resonance imager II
which tracks brain activity in relation
to oxygenated blood flow we can see that
looking at nature scenes activates many
parts of the brain now it&#39;s early days
research wise but we do see one
interesting finding is that many of
these regions have activated many
activated regions of the brain are rich
in opioid receptors now our opioid
system processes pleasure among other
things and so looking at nature scenes
may be like taking a little releasing a
little bit of morphine into our brains
and you thought we were just looking at
pretty pictures didn&#39;t you another
finding it&#39;s interesting is when we look
at urban scenes we tend to blink more
than when we look at nature scenes and
that&#39;s an indication that urban scenes
take more mental effort to to process
well nature is incredibly diverse with
so many different habitats what kind of
nature scenery relaxes us and cons us
the most this is using mobile
electroencephalography EEG headsets our
team with funding from National
Geographic is exploring this question
looking at nature moving imagery of
nature and urban scenes to see how we
can create desired patterns of brain
activity for example alpha wave rhythms
in our frontal lobes that correlate with
a relaxed mental state this is all part
of an emerging sub-discipline that I
call neuro Biophilia the science of how
nature engages the brain now I love that
we have all the some technology to help
us create powerful tools for anyone
locked indoors be they astronauts to
office workers hospital patients to the
elderly and perhaps one of the most
nature deprived audiences inmates
particularly in solitary confinement
fact the ceg work sprang from another
project uninvolved in called the Blue
Room the Blue Room led by ecologist
nalini Nadkarni at Oregon sniper
Correctional Institution allows inmates
to look at nature videos for an hour in
their recreation yard to voluntarily to
lower their stress and violence one
inmate I spoke with a notorious gang
member notoriously violent said that
looking at the videos for the first time
it made him weep it made him realize and
remember that there was so much beauty
in the world but he could still turn his
life around and and it shifted this
man&#39;s life perspective recalibrated him
in a way that you know shifted his whole
personal timeline in a way that no other
treatment had but nature&#39;s more than
just pretty pictures it&#39;s a multi
sensorial pharmacopoeia of microbes
sight sounds tastes and smells for
example Swedish researchers have found
just listening to nature sounds restores
us from stressful situations forty
percent faster than say listening to
urban sounds Japanese researchers have
found by studying a practice known as
shinrin yoku forest therapy that when we
walk through evergreen forests we
breathe in aromatic volatile compounds
called fightin sides and these can boost
our immune system lower stress hormones
and increase our ability to fight
cancers and ward off viruses now and
other researchers find that sunlight
triggers the production of vitamin D and
serotonin levels which can elevate our
moods and nitric oxide which can boost
blood flow let&#39;s not forget about those
microbes in the air and in the soil
finish researchers have found that
teenagers living in higher biodiversity
areas have a greater concentration a
higher diversity of gamma Proteobacteria
on their skin which can help combat
inflammation so I love and you know
knowing all this about
nature it becomes much more than just a
design aesthetic a potted plant it
becomes a health essential and sure we
can bring surround ourselves with all
sorts of nature&#39;s extracts of the Sun
lamp at the work desk and the oil of
cedar and aromatherapy going and then
the VR and this nature screen saver and
and we can do this and reaps and
benefits but their potency is reduced
without first-hand experience how about
reweaving real biodiversity back into
our built environment and making a more
concerted effort to get out into our
blue and green spaces sorry boss I just
got to go it&#39;s for my internal microbes
and my mental health I love that we have
all this technology to help us
diligently dump you know extract
nature&#39;s benefits particularly for those
audiences with few other options but as
much as as adapt as we can become at
recreating nature I think real the real
thing will always win out for me it&#39;s
those feelings i get from nature&#39;s all
of nature&#39;s unscripted wonders the
feelings of when i when i put my feet in
this
or when I dive into the ocean and sidle
up to some strange marine creature like
a giant ocean sunfish or when I come
across a beautiful flower that&#39;s opening
itself up to the Morning Sun or feeling
the nighttime air envelop me under a
starry sky it&#39;s that primal feeling of
awe and gratitude that we are part of a
4 billion year old story not written in
binary computer code but an ancient
messy spaghetti code helical II wound
into every one of our diverse habitats
many that we&#39;ve barely even begun to
explore but all that are essential to
our survival it&#39;s the realization that
we life is not a human monologue but a
wild chorus of microbes fun gee algae
plants animals rocks soil water air that
all comprise our mental sanity so grab
your kids your family your friends your
employees and your boss and let&#39;s walk
all this talk outside and remember what
it truly takes to be human
you
