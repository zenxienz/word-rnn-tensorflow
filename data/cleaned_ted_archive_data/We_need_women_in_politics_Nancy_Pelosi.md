I think you got a fan club Nancy so many
of us remember that iconic picture of
the day in which you were inaugurated
made the Speaker of the House and you
did something that no speaker had ever
done before you called children and and
in this case I think some of your own
children and grandchildren to the podium
and the photograph went out all over the
world and the people who are joining us
all over the world saw that photograph
and many people said leadership power
just changed something shifted did you
think of that consciously was that a
conscious decision you made that day
that was rather spontaneous as a matter
of fact I had been told that maybe it
wasn&#39;t I said may I bring my
grandchildren with me too
to accept the gavel and they said we&#39;re
not sure that the rules allow that and I
said well who&#39;s in charge of the rules
and they said the speaker said well okay
and I approve of that
but when I brought my grandchildren up I
could see in the eyes of the other
children because on the day of
swearing-in members bring their children
under 12 years of age to the floor and
they were sort of looking that way so I
invited them up children just came
running up children and grandchildren of
members from both sides of the aisle I&#39;m
happy to say and so was this big
collection of children there and I was
able to gavel the house the first time a
speaker on behalf of all of America&#39;s
children all of the world and that was
the message that went out that the
welfare of children and the concerns of
families was going to be a priority of
yours and the priority of your
leadership and many times women when we
have moved into positions of leadership
and power you know have been counseled
to distance ourselves somewhat from the
mother image the grandmother image you
know to be sure that we&#39;ll be seen as
tough enough and we&#39;ll have all the
right strategies in place so how do you
balance that well for me I always say to
people just be yourself and the self
that I am as a mom and a grandmother and
I consider my life in politics as an
extension of my role of mother when I
went in to Congress my children for were
and four were in college one was going
into college I asked her if it was okay
for me to run for Congress and she said
mother get a life and and she&#39;s here
today Alexandra with my son Paul we&#39;re
here but but I I always thought we
always want the best for our children
that means not necessarily the material
best or the most love and affection and
care and concern about the world in
which they will live and it isn&#39;t good
enough to have the best for our children
unless other children
have opportunity and have the comfort of
home in love and the rest so I don&#39;t
think we do our children and your favor
by raising them in a place where
everything&#39;s okay for them but that one
in five children in our country lives in
poverty or or goes to sleep hungry at
night that&#39;s how I&#39;m so pleased that we
just passed a bill and the president is
going to sign it on Monday for child
nutrition in America it&#39;s not though
it&#39;s not though about legislation it&#39;s
about problem solving and we think that
we were moving to solve that problem in
our country and of course our concern is
international global in that respect
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said
today in an interview that keeping this
balance between being tough enough and
her case being called the Iron Lady of
Africa and bringing as she described it
the grandmotherly my Ellen as she is
called by the families in her country
that that&#39;s a balance she has to fight
every day that she struggles with that
every day can you talk about that
balance in your own life between being
the tough leader that can keep can
wrangle all those differences of opinion
and yet the nurturing supportive mother
and grandmother well some people don&#39;t
think I do that balance well enough that
I am more strong shall we say than maybe
they would like but I&#39;m there to get a
job done and I think that&#39;s what women
do we&#39;re not there about power
necessarily unless it is for a purpose
and we&#39;re there to do a job and we get
it done and the way we get it done and I
effectively with our values-based our
concern for children and the rest but it
is it is a challenge women in politics
because even women as happy as they are
about seeing a woman be successful
really have a discomfort sometimes when
you have to be as strong as you need to
be to get the job done and I think that
doesn&#39;t bother me at all it&#39;s about the
children but you have suffered a bit of
those kinds of you know slings and
arrows as it were course everyone in
public life it&#39;s used to them but you
know people say well gee boys she&#39;s
really tough while she plays politics
like the men boys she really knows they
insisted she knows how to get things
done but it it does sometimes take being
tough and just taking that criticism and
and saying this is how we helps to have
friends like Pat Mitchell who encouraged
women all the time to do their best at
what they do
she really has been such a force and
speaker this is your interview what do
you think about women in power well I
know you know that you balance this
extremely well as do all the many of the
people who are here but I think one of
the things that our audiences around the
world are interested in both the women
and the men who&#39;ve gathered that this
conference is really looking at the ways
that ideas and leadership and innovative
solutions that are coming from women and
girls and the men who support them how
that&#39;s changing the direction of the
future how would you describe that well
first of all and they say this I&#39;m so
honored to be here with all of you so
many stories so many wonderful sources
of strength and inspiration to all of us
and it&#39;s always a wonderful thing to
draw that power and strength and
inspiration from women who are doing
things so much more difficult than
passing a healthcare bill in the
Congress of the United States because
the challenges they face are so
different but let me say that I think
that we have a responsibility to each
other the the story I like to tell is
one that really impacted me because when
you come and you&#39;re doing this for the
children and doing it the best you can
you have to recognize the responsibility
to the future that we have but also
acknowledge those who fought so hard to
get us to this place the best way I can
explain that and Pat has heard me tell
this story is that when I first became a
leader and I went from my first meeting
to the White House as the leader of the
Democrats I didn&#39;t think that much of it
I had been to the White House many times
I wasn&#39;t even apprehensive about it and
I been to many meetings there and but
when I went there and the door closed
behind me and we&#39;ve seen it at the small
table with the President Bush and the
vice president and Republican and
Democratic leaders from the house and
the Senate I realized that this was
unlike any meeting that I&#39;d ever been to
at the White House in fact it was unlike
any meeting any woman had ever been to
at the White House because you were
there not as an appointee of the
president however magnificent that honor
would be but your power was not derived
from someone else at the table but it
was derived from the people who had sent
you there and it&#39;s a very difficult
table to have to be a so why I was
sitting there and President Bush ever
gracious was welcoming me for my first
meeting and this or that all of a sudden
on my chair it became very crowded was
really crowded was just getting like
this at the tape at the chair and I and
I have looked like I had some unease as
the meeting was beginning but it was
crowded on my chair
and I realized that chair on a chair
with me with susan b anthony Elizabeth
Cady Stanton Sojourner Truth Alice Paul
did I say that Cree Chaumont all of the
women who would work so hard to get
women the right to vote
all the women who&#39;d worked so hard to
empower women all the women whose
shoulders we were standing on to get to
be there and they were all there on the
chair and this had never happened before
or since and I could hear them say at
last we have a seat at the table
[Applause]
and then they were gone then they were
gone
so again I mentioned that because when
you asked about getting the job done in
the rest
you&#39;re just not out there alone others
have gotten worked hard taken risk they
were very difficult at a time when a
woman couldn&#39;t even leave the house
alone much less to be preaching for
women&#39;s rights and you know 150 years
ago and now here I was with that seat at
the table and of course you understand
your responsibilities to women who will
come after or at the same time to help
them know their power realize their
power use it in a way that is a very
special contribution because I believe
that the contribution of women is one
that is so special so individual because
of the experiences that they have
whether it&#39;s professionally or
personally at home whatever and women&#39;s
intuition women&#39;s values women&#39;s
effectiveness in terms of the use of
time consensus building and the rest
really makes a big difference so again I
want women to take responsibility for
politics and government we need you very
much and we need many young
I can&#39;t think of a better message for us
to to bring to a close and extraordinary
day of stories except that I was
thinking as you were speaking madam
Speaker that all those women who were
sharing your chair you have now become
one of those women who shares the chairs
not only of all of us who are in this
room but our children and grandchildren
in the next generation so what will you
be saying to them what will be the voice
you what will be the message you will
give to tomorrow&#39;s women and men well
the challenges that we face are so great
men have been in charge for a very long
time I think there&#39;s room for some other
ideas and some of other forces of power
to come into play and I know my former
colleague Marjorie Marvel Margolis
Mezvinsky is here and she made a big
difference in Congress when she was
there I want I want women to know as I
keep saying no your power I wrote a book
called know your power Nora Ephron&#39;s
said next time you write a book let me
help you with the title that&#39;s a
terrible title I said well the first
title I I wanted was taken what I don&#39;t
like about my neck
that was already taken so in any event
will women to know their power I want
them to know there&#39;s a tremendous need
for more women to assume positions of
power I want young women to know that
it&#39;s important for other young women to
see women in their generation with their
experience whether it&#39;s a working mom in
having a seat at the table whatever that
seat of power happens to be because the
need is tremendous the contribution that
you can make is so individual and it is
that something where you just bar
yourself because that is the most unique
authentic contribution that you can make
with your values with your experience
the determination and in our country we
can certainly do better with improving
the number of women in power I know some
of our visitors have more women in their
legislators and of course President
Johnson Sirleaf isn&#39;t she magnificent so
I visited her I visited her in Liberia
right before I became speaker and she
put on this big welcome for us dancers
singers everybody from the business
community and they arts and this to that
and I thought how can I ever repay this
hospitality and so I said Madam
President when I speak I would like to
invite you to speak at a joint session
of Congress I thought that was
spectacular and she said oh that&#39;s great
I said when you&#39;re in Washington let me
know when you&#39;re coming and we&#39;ll
prepare for that she said I&#39;ll be there
in two weeks well I wasn&#39;t this finger
yet so I said perfect
so went home and I said to the then
speaker and the leaders and this is that
guess who&#39;s coming to speak to the guy
and we had the biggest turnout of
members and people were so proud and we
had to have all kinds of other events to
accommodate everyone who wanted to see
her and she made a speech about having
one foot into the well you know how
magnificent one foot into to the bush
with her grandmother who couldn&#39;t read
and her and she hit the World Bank
it was so spectacular no one ever heard
such a thing and it was so proud I was
so proud to have this woman president
there but I didn&#39;t know and I extended
the invitation every day in two weeks
but in any event it was something quite
spectacular for all Americans and for
the world to see this woman acclaimed in
the joint session of Congress so again
we help each other and and I think that
women helping women is very important
and only if only in the inspiration that
we receive from each other but hopefully
for the networking that&#39;s so important
and what you&#39;re doing here so Pat thank
you for the invitation Pat it really
must be where a spectacular person Adams
from a big fan of Pat
I&#39;m speaker when she says I do want to
manifest I&#39;m there I could let this go
on all night yeah I do what to make two
observations and I know that it&#39;s shared
by many people here that along with all
of the many legislative accomplishments
that you&#39;re making on behalf of this
country I think the the greatest legacy
in many ways is that you and the way
that you have just talked about power
and leadership have given us all
permission to know our power and to
seize the leadership to make a
difference in the world and I want to
say how grateful we are for that that is
a pretty big legacy
[Applause]
