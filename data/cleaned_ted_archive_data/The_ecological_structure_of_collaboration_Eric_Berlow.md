okay can you hear me okay so um we live
in a world today where we match like
with like you know if you like this
maybe we&#39;ll also like that or you should
meet Johnny he&#39;s a lot like you
I applied to the TED Fellows program
because I really wanted to meet and
collaborate with people who were totally
different than me outside my fishbowl
and see this goes yes okay I&#39;m an
ecologist and I&#39;ve been studying the
network structure of nature for almost
25 years and I just want to share with
you my little ecological perspective on
this diverse network of collaborations I
stumbled into so these are some of the
people that I collaborated with through
the program they&#39;re colored by
discipline and you can see most of them
are not like me I met David an artist
David Germann who does amazing
installations driven by data feeds and
we began a series of collaborations
around data art and data storytelling
we had one project in collaboration with
Intel labs that was called we the data I
was about the personal data economy and
democratizing data and in this one we we
aggregated a lot of expert knowledge to
map the network structure of the
personal data economy to try to find
leverage points for a positive change in
that project we needed experts on let&#39;s
say privacy and personal personal
security so who else to turn to but Sol
sheffy a human rights activist from
Bahrain named one of the bravest
bloggers in the world
she is so badass that she can&#39;t even
have a picture of herself online we also
needed expertise on issues of digital
access to the underserved and who better
to talk to than wiley das i cuff a
yemeni antis antis anti censorship
activist who helped keep the internet
alive during the protests of the Arab
Spring and then I found out that from
estra that she and Waleed actually
collaborated all the time it turns out
that while lead comes to the rescue
every time the Bahraini government takes
her site down so I realized that my
story wasn&#39;t unique the story of
collaboration and so just out of
curiosity I put a little email out a
little survey out to the TED Fellows
just a week ago to say hey can you just
send me a list of who you collapse
and this is what we got so I knew there
were a few but I had no idea there were
this many really and the program is only
five years old
so look at this these collaborations are
remarkably international and you might
think that these are just like a group
of people who you know got together at
EDD for a whole week and then they start
collaborating but actually even fellows
from different classes who never met
each other in person are beginning to
collaborate we could sort him by
discipline and from left to right
different colors and then vertically by
the diversity of those disciplinary
collaborations so up in the upper left
is a Camilo Rodriguez Beltran and the
Ted senior fellow he is a self-avowed
cross-disciplinary collaboration
and and he&#39;s not the only one because it
turns out that there&#39;s actually 84
percent of the people in this graph had
at least one cross-disciplinary
collaboration here&#39;s one Jessica green
is a microbial ecologist she studies the
biology of buildings in a human
microbiome she collaborated with a
journalist Adam Huggins and with the
filmmaker and former science fiction
writer
Anita Doran to create a sci-fi graphic
novel about the human microbiome set in
Paris that&#39;s a new Netflix genre and and
then this next one is submission my jaw
literally dropped when I read this one
check it out Suleiman bequite a
Jordanian social entrepreneur
collaborated with Adrian Hong in 2011
during the Libyan Revolution together
they helped open the door to evacuating
tens of thousands of injured civilians
to get them urgent medical care in
Jordan and in fact the collaboration had
to be kept secret because of a fear of
retaliation from the Libyan regime and
today is the first time it&#39;s ever been
mentioned in public so pretty amazing
but there&#39;s more we can let all these
people now sort themselves into groups
of people that are collaborating more
with one another and start to see the
emergence of collaborative communities
that are forming here that are
algorithmically sorted and colored by
the structure of the network so McLean
Adaro is at the center of a cluster of
performers have collaborated together
McClenathan
is an Ethiopian American
singer-songwriter and here is a video
image of one of her collaborations with
shadowmaster and performer christine
marie to make a cinematic shadow music
video of mcLeese work and it&#39;s
absolutely stunning on the other side of
the graph we got a hub Erik Erik Hersman
is a hub in an emerging collaborative
cluster around the African tech in
makerspace and there are just so many
other stories to tell then we don&#39;t have
time to tell them all today but the good
news is that we&#39;re making this entire
web online published today fully
interactive for you to explore and in
fact what you just saw everything
emerged from a collaboration among Ted
fellows this is a this cloud-based
interactive tool to map and share visual
stories about how things are connected
emerge from a collaboration of a few Ted
fellows David Germann the artist that I
mentioned earlier he did all the design
work that you see now he&#39;s sitting right
there
coast of the Biswas the computer
scientists in architecture was actually
making at work and he&#39;s arriving this
afternoon and me the complexity guy
we also are collaborating start with a
few other ted fellows as advisors like
Sean Buehrle and Jessica green and a
research group I didn&#39;t tell that so we
call it the mapper
and we&#39;ve actually never before
displayed it in public and I know may
sound cheesy but this particular network
story literally did change my life
I call it unexpected mismatches made in
heaven
thank you
