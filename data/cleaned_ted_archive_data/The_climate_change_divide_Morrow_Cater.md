I want you to consider this statistic
fewer than 33% Republicans in America
believe that climate change is the
result of burning fossil fuels this
despite an unprecedent worldwide
scientific consensus that it is and we
all know scientists like to agree they
don&#39;t maybe about gravity over 14,000
13,000 nearly 14,000 peer-reviewed
scientific papers our firmness 24 deny
it and yet Republican disbelief persists
people are on the world indeed people in
this audience are flummoxed what is
going on in the United States
historically Republicans are not anti
science Lincoln established the National
Academy of Sciences nor are they
anti-environment Nixon established the
Environmental Protection Agency
Republicans are conservatives they
conserve my work is climate and energy
but personally I&#39;m driven because my
kids are losing hope they watch as the
u.s. not only lags the drags the rest of
the world down when dealing with this
problem how is it that we&#39;ve become so
polarized and paralyzed and since when
is scientific certainty a matter of
politics and belief to try to understand
this I had to do something extremely
uncomfortable
I had to burst my own ideological bubble
mine was a liberal bubble I grew up in a
progressive household so politically
embedded literally but the phone next to
my parents bed was a direct line to the
White House and it rang 24/7 during the
reign of Lyndon Baines Johnson but while
I grew up thinking the progressive
agenda was the right agenda I wasn&#39;t
deaf to those on the right that&#39;s harder
to be today as mainstream media is
contracting an opinion media&#39;s exploding
and the internet is designed to give you
back only what you want to know our
ideological bubbles are becoming more
isolated and insulated than ever and
researchers like Dan kahan at Yale have
found it is those bubbles the cultural
values and the groups that hold them
have more impact on our perception of
certain issues than our understanding of
the science indeed the more
scientifically literate you become the
more you use that information to confirm
the views of your group so the more
conservative you are and the more you
know about science the more you think
climate is not a problem and this is
somewhat of a problem but it isn&#39;t just
a purview of the right less does it - on
a number of different issues and it
still doesn&#39;t explain why Republicans
are on the wrong side of the scientific
consensus and that question kind of
drove my own personal Odyssey and I
traveled to the Midwest and the
southeast in places that are much more
conservative and much more dependent on
fossil fuels
than the rest of the country and I got
to know some very conservative leaders
of organizations representing millions
on the right and after months of months
of conversation and correspondents and
meetings and late-night confessions
neither easy nor comfortable I actually
grew to love these leaders these are
people my liberal colleagues routinely
demonize and I discovered three things
one malfeasance does exist not such a
big discovery I realize but they hear me
out the fossil fuel industry has been
very very good to us but increasingly
its costs are being borne by society and
it doesn&#39;t want to change that up so
it&#39;s been spending billions of dollars
on a disinformation campaign to confuse
the public about climate science and
it&#39;s using in many cases the very same
scientists that the tobacco industry
used to tell us tobacco wasn&#39;t a problem
- conservatives are being targeted on
the hill and in the heartland one
Republican congressman told me yeah I
get it about climate change but I can&#39;t
take it on because I&#39;m going to get
out and evangelical and that&#39;s easy to
do an evangelical conservative said we
conservatives are find of anything that
appears to threaten the values we hold
dear
and that&#39;s exactly what the
disinformation campaign does it frames
the solutions to climate change as
contracting personal freedoms and
expanding government when in fact all
that needs to happen is to stop
socializing the costs of one industry
another conservatives told me though but
we Republicans can&#39;t advance their own
solutions to this until we acknowledge
the problem in the first place
leads me to three wee liberals can be
our own worst enemy sometimes we think
we own the high moral ground and that
tends to cause us to disrespect and
demonize people who are not part of the
choir it also leads to a somewhat
distorted worldview we&#39;re being right is
more important than finding solutions
and I&#39;ll give you an example Governor
John Kasich of a Republican of Ohio
publicly acknowledged last year that
climate change is a problem and what did
we liberals do we plastered his face and
his quote on billboards all around the
Republican convention hall I&#39;m not sure
why but we made him a pariah and his
party and he&#39;s not talking about climate
change anymore you liberals think that
if we scream loud enough and and long
enough Republicans will finally get it
about climate when in fact the opposite
is true but the dynamic is changing
outside the Beltway and outside national
media the urgency gravity and
opportunity of this moment is actually
coming quite apparent extreme weather
Trump&#39;s politics and Republicans and
Democrats are working together in the
flooded ranges of New York and New
Jersey and the parched farmlands of
Kansas and Colorado and Texas to deal
with the impacts and states across the
country Republicans and Democrats are
moving to cleaner more efficient forms
of energy because it makes economic
sense my travels have changed me I can&#39;t
call myself a liberal anymore that
bubble has burst I know too much about
the forces that work to keep us apart
and I care too much about the leaders
that I&#39;ve grown too
these are courageous leaders they&#39;ve
managed to transcend their ideological
boundaries and understand the science
because they learned largely from
someone they trusted if they get the
risk and to ignore the risk is not
conservative they are working to bring
their constituencies along because they
also see the opportunity it&#39;s a moment
in history with opportunity to move from
a clean new from a dirty dying economy
to a clean thriving economy it&#39;s a
moment when we could actually grow
prosperity it&#39;s a moment when we could
actually expand personal freedoms
imagine owning your own electricity
imagine an oil regime without that kind
of power
it&#39;s a moment these leaders think when
maybe just maybe we can discover our
shared humanity and forge solutions that
can unite and not divide us thank you
