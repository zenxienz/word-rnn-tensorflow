bought dodgiest orders that means good
afternoon everyone and because this is
Ted you might like to know the word
Viagem as well which means journey now I
have been learning Portuguese for about
Oh a year and a half now and here&#39;s my
biggest insight Brazilians want to love
you they want to be loved by you they
just don&#39;t want you to understand them
and that&#39;s why cunningly they chose
Portuguese as their language now at
first glance it&#39;s straightforward I&#39;ve
heard Spanish speakers say it sounds
just like Spanish except you&#39;re holding
your nose it&#39;s very straightforward you
can look at newspaper headlines and
recognize words you can see from shop
signs that&#39;s what I was doing
let me introduce you to the first three
words that I learnt let&#39;s see if it
works yes
Familia what does that mean family
second word that Benjy that means
depends okay this one little harder now
there guy to navigate right um for
heaven&#39;s sake it could almost be English
look at it I thought this is so easy now
admittedly my first sentence in
Portuguese it depends on my family
navigating had limited applications in
everyday use but it inspired me I said
yes I&#39;ll go on and do this and actually
I had no choice why did I have no choice
because I had been commissioned to write
a book about my usual things you know of
drugs guns favelas I write about
organized crime and
politics and that sort of things and one
of my interviewees is in a federal
penitentiary maximum security and so he
doesn&#39;t speak English so really I had no
choice at all but as I said Portuguese
is deceptive
it&#39;s very deceptive amongst Portuguese
speakers the greatest amusement is
caused by my pronunciation of the
nasalized diphthongs and vowels such as
L and in my first Portuguese teacher
said that my initial attempts of
pronouncing these were sounding like a
cat being tortured not in Portuguese but
a cat being tortured in Polish and those
nasal sounds they&#39;re the easy bit now
I&#39;m gonna be honest with you I&#39;m having
real problems with this language why is
it I already speak several foreign
languages some of them more distant from
English than Portuguese like check for
example okay
here&#39;s the thing when I last learn to
language I was in my late 20s I&#39;m now in
my mid 50s I know I know I find it hard
to believe - and believe me when you&#39;ve
got your fifties strange things start
happening to your brain as I&#39;m sure the
50-somethings here will understand or
maybe not maybe it&#39;s just me I don&#39;t
know but memory oh my word my memory
it&#39;s just going all over the place now
look I can tell you who was number one
in the British charts in May 1967 sandy
shore with a puppet on the string fresh
from her victory at the Eurovision Song
Contest but can I tell you if I
remembered to lock the back door five
minutes ago no I can&#39;t
what is that well that&#39;s because in
language
terms the gradual domination of
long-term memory over short-term memory
means that when it comes to grammar it&#39;s
fine I&#39;ve been operating in foreign
languages for 40 years or so I know what
the subjunctive mood of a verb is and I
know when it might be needed but
short-term memory learning new
vocabulary ah particularly something
like Brazilian Portuguese where many of
the words have origins in Arabic African
languages and indigenous languages so
that&#39;s when younger people have a real
advantage over me the second thing about
your fifties now like a lot of you here
I spent a lot of time listening to loud
music when I was younger and as a result
age-related deafness is accelerating
this is this is critical in
understanding and understanding why I
have so many problems with Portuguese
because our innate ability to imitate
sounds and absorb them starts dropping
off at about the age of 12 and it&#39;s more
or less over by the time you&#39;re 25 so
for me the intellectual process of
learning how to pronounce Portuguese is
one of sort of hit-and-miss
mimicry made much much more difficult by
by the fact that I&#39;m basically half deaf
so I want to show you what happens okay
so in visit to this I&#39;m in a supermarket
let&#39;s I&#39;m in zone Azul here in Rio and
I&#39;ve got my trolley and putting my milk
in and then I&#39;m going to put in my grape
juice in fact I wanted to buy eggs but I
always get the word for egg and grape
mixed up so and then I&#39;m going and I&#39;m
saying I&#39;m going to the where am I going
I&#39;m going to the checkout and I&#39;m saying
to myself when I get to the checkout I&#39;m
going to give my money I want my change
back and
please person in the checkout don&#39;t say
anything to me because I won&#39;t
understand it and then I look stupid and
I&#39;m British like hate looking stupid and
then I get to the checkout and this is
what happens or at least I hope it&#39;s
what happens let&#39;s see I&#39;m waiting for
an out-of-body experience and it&#39;s not
coming let&#39;s see if it comes now no it
doesn&#39;t so I could sort of skip over
this it would be a shame believe me I
will try and click it again I&#39;ve got a
new clicker lucky on me let&#39;s see still
not working no I wonder if Craig could
do it manually from behind ok so check
out
- what was that I&#39;ve absolutely no idea
okay absolutely no idea but let&#39;s hear
it in English percent off your shopping
today and you have the chance to win
free tickets to a Miley Cyrus concert
oMG I missed the chance to get free
tickets to a Miley Cyrus concert okay
would you like tell me why because this
is what I heard
[Music]
yeah so so there we have it so there we
have it the first two things about your
50s which makes learning a language
difficult which were of course some
memory and deafness and the third thing
well a professor of Modern Languages at
Cambridge University explained to me
that when her students go abroad for
their year off for language training she
can always tell which ones when they
come back have acquired a boyfriend or
girlfriend abroad because she says
they&#39;re just much chattier and they&#39;re
really good at saying phrases like you
know you look really great in that dress
right now why is that it&#39;s because in
your teens and 20s chatting people up
and getting drunk are often part of
learning a language it&#39;s very true and
partying and socializing is fantastic
for learning a language in general now

in your 50s 9:30 9:45 oh do you know all
I&#39;m ready for them frankly I want to be
tucked up in bed
by then I do and the only thing I&#39;ve got
enough energy to do is to watch an
episode of Breaking Bad that&#39;s it
okay two episodes of Breaking Bad anyway
but despite all these problems I will
persist with learning Portuguese why
will I do that well the brain is like a
muscle and so that means if you practice
it we have evidence that learning a
language in your later years can help
you ward off the onset of dementia later
on might as much as four or five years
that&#39;s not bad at all so I see my daily
Portuguese studies as a workout for the
brain but also Portuguese is key
to Brazilian identity now some people in
the past have said that football or
soccer is key to Brazilian identity not
after this summer they don&#39;t says says
the Englishman right okay but if you
think of South America okay what
Divine&#39;s Brazil Brazil it&#39;s Portuguese
language it makes it very different from
the rest of South America now this week
we&#39;ve heard how this country faces big
problems it has divisions on on ethnic
and on wealth lines and and things like
that but it also comes together through
one thing and one thing alone in my
opinion and that is the Portuguese
language it binds this nation as no
other aspect of the nation&#39;s life can or
does it&#39;s absolutely fantastic so by
learning Portuguese what I&#39;m really
doing is beginning to understand this
incredible country and its culture but
as I said it is not easy and here in Rio
we speak a variant of the language
called Carioca all right now frankly
that&#39;s like trying to learn the Queen&#39;s
English in Louisiana
it really is it&#39;s very very difficult
okay but I&#39;m gonna give you some tips on
just before I end on on one or two
things if you want to learn Portuguese
you need to know these following things
okay
and oh it&#39;s pronounced au sometimes an E
is pronounced an I sometimes and don&#39;t
get me going on the bloody aah oh my god
at the beginning of the word
it&#39;s an H in the middle of the word it
is an R again and then at the end of the
word it&#39;s a sort of sound I mean so the
city here Rio it&#39;s not called Rio it&#39;s
called heel now I ask you what sort of a
language is it that has letters in it
which
change their sound from words word
depending on where they are in the way
it&#39;s absolutely ridiculous
anyway moving swiftly on now as someone
who spent twenty to twenty five years of
their professional life in rather grim
circumstances sometimes in Eastern
Europe I was covering civil wars I was
covering organized crime and it was
really tough and I came here to Brazil
where I wanted to continue my work and I
had to deal with some depressing
subjects here as well but what learning
Portuguese has taught me and getting to
know this culture is despite all their
challenges Brazilians exude a fantastic
sense of optimism and a fabulous is y de
vivre and that is summed up in my
favorite Carioca phrase became immortal
bailius which means literally I was in
the hand of the clown figuratively it
means I was so drunk last night I have
absolutely no idea what I got up to and
I don&#39;t even know if I got home or not
so please I want you to enjoy Rio I want
you to have a great time with the
Cariocas but don&#39;t bother trying to
understand them but most importantly of
all as far as I&#39;m concerned stay well
away from the hand of the clown obrigado
boa noite see
thanks Chris
