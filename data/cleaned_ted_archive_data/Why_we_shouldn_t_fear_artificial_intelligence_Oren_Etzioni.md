when Stephen Hawking in Scarlett
Johansson and now Nick Bostrom sing from
the same hymn book you can&#39;t help but
pay attention
Elon Musk has warned us that with
artificial intelligence were summoning
the demon I take this kind of demon talk
personally it hurts right here and
that&#39;s because I&#39;ve been an AI
researcher for more than twenty years
now I&#39;m the CEO of Paul Allen&#39;s
Institute for AI in Seattle and I&#39;m not
scared here here&#39;s why intelligence and
autonomy are two very different things
I&#39;m going to illustrate this with the
simple two by two table in the top left
we have high autonomy with minimal
intelligence that&#39;s a bunch of teenagers
drinking on a Saturday night in the
bottom right we have high intelligence
with minimal autonomy that&#39;s IBM&#39;s
Watson the program to beat the world
champion in jeopardy but didn&#39;t even
know it one not very threatening think
about computer viruses they&#39;re dangerous
they&#39;re autonomous but they&#39;re not
intelligent AI and autonomy are these
two very different things an autonomy is
the issue well you might say well what
about something like the Hal computer
that hijacked a storyline in the movie
2001 Space Odyssey and I would say you
have to separate science from science
fiction reality from Hollywood
storylines the reality is that an
asteroid striking the earth and
annihilating human life as we know it is
more likely than AI turning evil is and
ruin put it working to prevent the AI
from turning evil is like disrupting the
space program to prevent overpopulation
on Mars it overlooks the technical
challenges which are formidable and it
overlooks the potential benefits for
Humanity why play with fires of were you
you might say well fire and
other technologies provide enormous
benefits imagine a world without fire
without electricity at the Allen
Institute we&#39;re working on overcoming
information explosion for scientists and
doctors as air corvatz of Microsoft
footed it&#39;s the absence of AI
technologies that&#39;s already killing
people due to errors that could be
prevented using AI medical errors and so
on human drivers worry me particularly
now that I have a 16 year old with a
driver&#39;s license so intelligent cars are
going to reduce accidents and save lives
as per the previous talk the thing again
to remember is that the mechanical
driving decisions whether it&#39;s automatic
transmission or braking and so on are up
to the machine but the human is still in
charge so what I want to tell you is
let&#39;s not worry about far-fetched
fantastical scenarios we&#39;re inspired to
tackle so many real problems here at Ted
the bottom line is this AI is not going
to exterminate us it&#39;s going to empower
us to help tackle real problems and to
help humanity thank you
