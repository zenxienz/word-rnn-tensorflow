hello everybody I&#39;ve been invited here
today to talk about a tool that
everybody can use that you can use to
promote positive change and bring worlds
together it&#39;s an honor for me to be here
today in front of such an amazing group
of people who have come from all over
the world every time I come to Africa
I&#39;m absolutely amazed and just
overwhelmed by all the culture and the
diversity and the music and the colors
and the smells and luckily for me I get
to visit Africa almost every day with my
job but I do it virtually through Google
Earth so I&#39;m here today to talk to you
about Google Earth what exactly is
Google Earth as you can see here it&#39;s
this program I&#39;m going to zoom in to
Africa let&#39;s go ahead and zoom in to
where we are here today in Arusha Google
Earth is a program that you can download
for free from the internet and it
contains as you can see here aerial
imagery as well as all types of other
information but I&#39;m going to show you
here that you can turn on and off
including roads 3d buildings borders of
countries it&#39;s an amazing tool for
planning purposes a lot of people will
just zoom in and just see their own
backyard of their house some people may
use it to plan where to put a school or
where to put a hospital so today I&#39;m
here to tell you a story about Darfur we
were luckily enough to with a Google
Earth to work with the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum they spent
months this amazing group of people
compiling data to use Google Earth to
promote global awareness of the issue in
Sudan and Darfur and today I&#39;d like to
show you some of the some of the the
work that they did
when a user downloads Google Earth and
they fly over Sudan this is what they&#39;ll
see this will come up automatically and
it&#39;s actually located over here every
time a person opens up Google Earth the
museum has put together information
where a user can click and interact with
these maps this is an introduction
information what we call a pop-up
balloon this gives background
about the situation if a person&#39;s
interested they can learn more very
easily by clicking on this link here
called learn more and a website will pop
up they can also go to how can I help
and learn what they can do and to find
more information there&#39;s a link here to
download more data and I&#39;d like to take
you on a tour of this area as you can
see here the borders of Darfur are shown
in orange lines you see these little
camera what we call icons you can click
on these and pictures come up with
stories of different people in the area
this is a family that sleet that fled
Darfur into eastern Chad you see here
these little icons these are
representative of the 1600 villages that
have been damaged and destroyed in the
area and I&#39;m going to take you on a tour
of one of the villages
this is chete if you zoom in closer you
can see the village there used to be
1300 structures here and you can see
that each one of these circles is
representative of the house that was
destroyed this blue line represents a
seventy three mile tracks that one
family had to take across the desert
into a refugee camp which you can also
see on Google Earth and you can see
where this family lives now so with that
I&#39;m going to bring us back to Africa and
I want to say that there is a positive
note to this story that after this was
released over a million people within
five days went to the Holocaust Museum
to learn more about this I hope that&#39;s
this demo although it seems very sad I
hope that this actually promotes you and
inspires you to use this type of free
tool and the work that you do and this
is freely available to everybody we have
over 200 million users who see the work
there&#39;s other organizations in Africa
who are doing wonderful things with
Google Earth if you&#39;re interested in
learning more we do have a booth outside
and the exhibition hall and I&#39;d love to
answer any questions you have so please
stop by thank you
[Applause]
