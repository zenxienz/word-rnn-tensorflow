I&#39;m a treasure hunter that means I spend
my time trying to solve historical
mysteries by digging up artifacts
oftentimes from the bottoms of bodies of
water
I either tag along with other
archaeologists and divers on their
missions or I put them together myself
now last summer I&#39;d had the joy of
joining an archaeologist from Texas
State University named Fritz Hanselman
Fritz found a ship in Panama that may
have belonged to the pirate Captain
Morgan they guided the rum onboard were
more than 80 treasure chests in case
you&#39;re wondering this is what a 350
year-old treasure chest looks like and
this is what a 350 year-old barrel looks
like really cool now last year I also
joined another guy a filmmaker named
Ryan Katzenbach and we found a gun in a
canal in Amityville New York that he
thinks may be the long missing second
murder weapon in the 1970s Amityville
Horror murders this thing really cool
stuff so anyway now I&#39;m working on my
own dive sort of my pet project I&#39;ve
been working on this thing for the past
couple years now a lot of people don&#39;t
know this but beginning in 1942 pinball
machines were illegal in New York City
really crazy the logic the reasoning was
that they were a game of chance in that
skill and thus gambling they&#39;re also
viewed as a mob racket and just as
morally corrupting evil almost satanic
influence that would destroy children&#39;s
minds it was a really just kind of crazy
moral crisis and there was no greater
threat to pinball machines in Mayor
LaGuardia that&#39;s actually war to himself
pushing over machines after it LaGuardia
hated pinball he hated warned anything
it&#39;s really not an exaggeration to say
that one of the top priorities of
laguardia&#39;s entire administration was
rounding up pinball machines and
arresting their owners he dreams of a
pinball free New York City
so under laguardia&#39;s watch the NYPD had
squads pinball squads dedicated sweeping
through the mob dens smashing machines
in a series of prohibition style raids
you could replace one of these machines
with an oak whiskey barrel you&#39;d have a
scene from Boardwalk Empire or the
touchable laguardia hated pinball
machines just six weeks after Pearl
Harbor he walks into the office of the
police commissioner and he tells him the
number one priority for all available
officers in New York City beat around
that machines and arrest their owner
within one day of the ban NYPD
compensates more than 2,300 pinball
machines in issues more than 1,000 court
summons to the game so anyway what did
they do with these machines well through
the 1930s when the first anti pinball
law started to trickle through City Hall
this is what they do they take them
along with all the other muhabba Lou
we&#39;re talking slot machines brass
knuckles shotguns knives
counterfeit subway slugs they take them
all they put them onto a barge they go
they leave from lower Manhattan they go
about 40 miles of Long Island Sound just
about two miles from Eden&#39;s neck
lighthouse and they dump them to this
day
Long Island Sound is home to this
massive stash of mob loot including
hundreds if not thousands of pinball
machines now on one of these dumps the
police commissioner turns to reporter on
the barge and he tells them if anybody
wants to go dig this stuff up now
they&#39;re welcome to 80 years later that&#39;s
what I intend to do for the past three
years I&#39;ve been working with a treasure
diver named bill Pfeiffer this guy and
we&#39;ve been taking all available pieces
of evidence we can find in order
pinpoint exactly where these machines
were dumped and we think we know where
they are just the other week we did a
survey and recon done the survey and
recon mission where we went into some
underwater photography in order to kind
of see what the lay the land was so we
can prepare for the next step which is
to put a guy in the water into an
exploratory dive and dick our goal is to
find his machines now why why are we
spending so much time and an effort
searching for something that is quite
literally trash these were thrown away
well here&#39;s the deal history has become
stagnant people had this assumption it
taken for granted that anything that can
be discovered can be anything that can
be discovered has been discovered
anything that can be asked has been
asked any questions that are out there
if somebody&#39;s working on them
that&#39;s simply not the case you see
history is all about decisions it&#39;s
about one person perhaps a story in
deciding that one thing is worth asking
over another that one thing is worth
teaching over another and one thing is
worth discussing over another and those
decisions a dirty little secret they&#39;re
all arbitrary
and so by looking for these machines you
see I don&#39;t have a history ph.d I&#39;m not
even a very good diver but by looking
for these machines I am telling the
world that this happened and that it
shouldn&#39;t be forgotten you see this was
a really major part of American history
of New York history pinball machines
were illegal in New York from 1942 until
1976 alcohol prohibition lasted about a
decade pinball prohibition lasted thirty
four years and the chances are then
until this moment you had no idea so
here&#39;s the deal it&#39;s time to reclaim
history it&#39;s time to go out there and be
a gonzo historian they go look for some
historical mystery to ask some
historical question perhaps one that
nobody has even thought to ask I promise
you won&#39;t have to look very hard and
then try it try to find an answer go
digging for answers and then let the
world know what you find
thank you
