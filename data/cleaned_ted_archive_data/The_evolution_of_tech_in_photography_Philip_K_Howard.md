let&#39;s braid I just said I do our
portraits using hundred year
oh gee I used what&#39;s known as an
eight-by-ten view camera which is the
same kind of camera used by Ansel Adams
and Carleton Watkins and and others of
that age here is the camera in action
and here are a few portraits this is a
young cousin Lily who works at the Santa
Fe Institute this is former senator al
Simpson the author of the simpson-bowles
plan
this is distinguished ed Speaker Nobel
laureate Danny Kahneman this is a
British fashion figure taken minutes
after she came down for breakfast a New
Year&#39;s Day in her pajamas after a long
night of partying I was a magazine
photographer briefly after the college
before I went on to my real life and I
took this up about four years ago when I
realized that the digital revolution
made using the old tech using old
technology much more practical so I
still take that you take the big camera
have film holders like this they take
the pictures as I take the negative to
be developed by a professional lab but
then everything else is digital i scan
each negative into a 300 megabyte file
and print it digitally I bought all the
equipment on eBay it could hardly be
more inconvenient to use but that&#39;s part
of the attraction to me it has it has
swings and tilts it alter the plane of
the lens to the film and dozens of
things that can go wrong but it also
produces photographs that I believe are
unique in a number of ways first it has
a level of detail that&#39;s still unmatched
by the digital cameras although there&#39;s
a new $50,000 digital camera that claims
to be almost have the resolution of an 8
by 10 camera this is a tensor from
Chicago
this is a detail of his eye you get them
every pore the moisture you see the
depth in the iris of his eye these
photographs can be blown up to be the
size of a wall and lose virtually
nothing with them another characteristic
is that there&#39;s no depth of field so his
eyebrow without a focus in that in that
camera and inch or less is in focus and
this has several virtues what it means
is your your it&#39;s as if you&#39;re there I&#39;m
looking at the picture that looking at
the person that&#39;s how we see people we
don&#39;t see people as a kind of a a
postcard of everything in detail we&#39;re
looking at them closely and so all the
great portraits in history I did not
take this one
have have a very shallow depth of field
but they also have an immediacy you can
almost feel that you&#39;re there with with
President Lincoln it has other virtues
too one of the virtues is it has
extraordinary texture so here&#39;s a friend
of mine who&#39;s an expert in international
law and terrorism extraordinarily
thoughtful and distinguished scholar
this is British artist
Anthony McCall who does light sculptures
now has a big show in England this is
the head of the American Academy in Rome
famously rebuilt that institution over
the last 25 years this is a goddaughter
happens to be an artist in in Brooklyn
this is Chuck closest art dealer
Chuck&#39;s most recent show and there&#39;s one
other aspect of this technology that I
think unique which is that it captures a
self-consciousness that comes with the
deliberate nature of the process it
takes a minute or so to focus each
photograph with another minute or longer
to put the film plate in the camera and
wait for the right moment to to snap the
picture and during that time the subject
can&#39;t move an inch without destroying
the focus that required stillness is
conducive to reflection and I think it
often reveals something about the person
that you wouldn&#39;t get in a ordinary
setting
here&#39;s bruno our host looking like the
visionary here&#39;s my literary agent
looking suitably aggressive as a friend
of the family of famous sports woman in
the new york area perhaps reflecting on
the minigames and contests she&#39;s won
over a long life this is our oldest
daughter the only mature person in our
family and finally here is Lily again
she looked calm and open and strong my
wife feels he looks like the Greek
goddess Athena
there&#39;s a reason she looks like this
Lily lives with a life-threatening
disease which she was born with her
openness to life almost fearlessness I&#39;d
like to think comes through in this
photograph by a huge old camera thank
you
you
