you act differently what other people
are watching I think most of us do but
if you know the classic theory behind
that I love to share it with you it&#39;s
called the Hawthorne effect now the
story starts about a century ago right
outside of Chicago at a place called
Hawthorne works now the people in charge
of the factory want them to be more
productive but they weren&#39;t exactly sure
how they started doing little
experiments they make the lights
brighter one week and then dimmer the
next week they change the seating
arrangements they do all these subtle
changes some of them known some of them
not known and see if there was more
productivity and there was problem was
they weren&#39;t exactly sure what x-factor
made them more productive so after
several years of experimenting roughly
from 1924 to 1933 they suddenly stopped
until there was dr. Henry a Lance Berger
he was a psychologist and in the fifties
he revisited this idea and he thought
there was something that they might have
missed and there was she there looked
looking for one particular factor you
make the lights brighter and people will
be 60% more productive you make the
lights dimmer and there&#39;ll be 20% less
productive things of that nature there
was one common factor but nothing to do
with the pieces of the experiment it had
to it&#39;s experiment itself people were
acting differently in this case being
more productive because they were being
observed
that&#39;s the Auburn effect dr. Landsberg
will add a field day with right now 2014
right at this very moment I can take a
picture of you guys which I won&#39;t but I
can take a picture of you guys and share
with my 2,000 friends on Facebook if you
have a thought in your head you can put
onto Twitter share with the half billion
people at this very moment we can
download an app called Foursquare
check-in to this location and tell the
whole world strangers at all what we&#39;re
doing right now in other words we&#39;re not
only focused on observing other people
we&#39;re really focused on being observed
we&#39;re all under the Hawthorne effect now
I love this abstract stuff I hope you do
too now it&#39;s about a year ago when I was
writing my latest book I was researching
these theories and the funniest thing
happened
I became a dad now as seller fathers and
mothers mentors and Guardians know you
want to challenge is your life it&#39;s very
much a before and an after and as soon
as I&#39;ll extend my son dies these
abstract series came crashing down and I
understood one thing and that was less
than uncle side to the Hawthorne effect
and that is that children will act
differently if they feel as though
they&#39;re being observed they&#39;re being
protected and they&#39;re being loved now my
sudden I have a ton of routines that we
do this is one of them and he was about
two months old here now you have one
guess of what language I don&#39;t know so
as you enjoy tedactive this week I just
have one question for you
I love for you to ponder do you want to
be an attention grabber or an attention
giver you want to be future focused or
do you want to be fully present and
finally and most importantly you only be
Pavlovian or do you want to be truly
responsive to the people around you that
you love thank you so much
[Applause]
