Thank You Silvia you won the 2009 TED
Prize for anyone who is not with us then
can you just tell us a little bit about
what you want it for and update us
briefly on what has happened in the
years since then
well my I was given a chance to make any
wish big enough to change the world and
I was given 18 minutes to articulate it
the wish was easy the 18 minutes that
was hard and now we have just a little
sliver I wished for it you&#39;ll hear it on
this little film clip a part of it at
least to ignite public support to enlist
all of you to enlist the world to really
embrace the ocean to understand that our
lives really depend on taking care of
the ocean through networks of hope spots
protected areas much as we&#39;ve done on
the land with national parks and such
but when the TED Prize was awarded in
2009 I made the wish only about one
percent of the ocean had some form of
protection and the tiny fraction of that
was safe for ocean wildlife like fish
well today I&#39;m happy to say five years
later that it&#39;s we&#39;ve more than doubled
the amount of ocean that is protected
that sounds like a lot but you know
we&#39;re still talking about maybe two
percent and it&#39;s still a fraction of one
percent or even the fish and other ocean
wildlife are safe we have to really
change the way we think about the ocean
in the film mission blue is a step in
that direction we hope we need your
voice need your participation to try to
understand and then use your power use
your voice to take care of the blue part
of planet dearth and make it less than
that make it rock make it the vibrant
system that it was before we started to
erode the natural systems to the point
where our future is truly at risk so
good news lots of good news that
president of Palau has declared their
entire exclusive economic zone as
off-limits to commercial fishing no
freshmen like sound like bad news but
90% of many of the fish that we see in
the markets and in our restaurants and
supermarkets whatever are already gone
we cannot continue to take the levels
that we have and around the world
the momentum is building to safeguard
large parts of the ocean not just for
the creatures who live there but for us
the most important thing that we extract
from the ocean is our existence now we
know if you like to breathe you&#39;ll take
care of the ocean and you will dive in
and understand why it matters to take
care of the wild blue systems that
really take care of us
and can you tell us just a little bit
about what we&#39;re gonna see in this film
clip oh or about the film itself well as
part of the response to the wish we had
support to have an expedition to the
Galapagos Islands and some of you in the
audience I know were part of that
amazing group of people and it included
a film team that really started the
process that now four years later we
went to the Galapagos in April of 2010
and that has spun off a host of
incredible things including some that
will be featured in the mission blue
film and you can go to the website and
see mission blue and you know sign in we
have more than a hundred partners around
the world who are lending their voices
and their power to help with this
initiative to take care of the blue and
that&#39;s what&#39;s the film is about it it&#39;s
a little bit too much I think about me
but I&#39;m the witness and I try to take
you where I go and to see what I&#39;ve seen
during about 60 years of diving into the
blue parts of the planet and I want all
of you to be there and come along well
let&#39;s uh let&#39;s do exactly that can we
roll a little bit of the film okay
only have this idea where humans at the
ocean is so big so vast so resilient it
doesn&#39;t matter what we do to it helps
raise our ignorance is really the
biggest problem that we now face we now
can learn from the past and as never
before do something about it before it&#39;s
too late
Silvia has a wish for the planet what
she calls her mission blue and it&#39;s
really very simple protect the ocean in
the same way we now protect the land
at 1872 the United States began
establishing a system of parks that some
say was the best idea America ever had
about 12% of the land around the world
is now protected but only a fraction of
1% of the ocean is fully protected
globally I wish you would use all means
at your disposal to ignite public
support for a global network of marine
protected areas hope spots large enough
to save and restore the ocean the blue
heart of the planet my wish is a big
wish but if we can make it happen it can
truly change the world there you go
so one quick question for you before I
let you get off the stage we have some
sense of how we went about establishing
national parks on the land you know and
some of it boils down to we looked at
these incredibly spectacular places like
Yellowstone like Yosemite that were
clearly unparalleled treasures and we
said we need to protect this when you
are looking at the ocean which to
ignorant eyes appears on the surface
relatively undifferentiated but it&#39;s
obviously a wildly variable beneath how
do you choose the hope spots that you
most want to invest resources and energy
and protecting well some of them places
are pretty obvious like the breeding
areas the spawning sites the nursery
areas but we&#39;re working with the
International Union for the Conservation
of Nature which is a network of
countries and organizations and
scientists from around the world and use
them sort of as a sounding board and 50
places were put up just at the
International marine protected areas
conference last fall as indications but
you know you can name your own Hope
spots there they tend to be places that
are in good shape pristine areas but not
necessarily for me Chesapeake Bay is a
host spot because we can make it better
by investing ourselves in turning things
around doesn&#39;t have to be a specifically
delineated area it can be a concept
reasons for hope Gulf of Mexico there
are lots of reasons for hope to restore
that magnificent body of water but for
me there&#39;s really just one it&#39;s the
ocean all of it
it&#39;s the blue heart of the planet how
much your heart do you want to protect
all of it all of it one way or the other
but here&#39;s a good start half of the
world is called the high seas and every
person on the planet has a vested
interest in taking care of it it belongs
to you it belongs to all of us or none
of us it&#39;s like the air the global
Commons and it is on the Block right now
being carved up by various interests
right like the Wild West you can go out
there and do just about whatever you
want or you can use your voice to say
it&#39;s a public trust we need to take care
of it like we take care of or don&#39;t take
care of the air but we all have a vested
interest and making sure that it stays
in good shape so use your voice use your
power for at least half the world the
high seas
this is a moment in time thank you thank
you so much
[Applause]
