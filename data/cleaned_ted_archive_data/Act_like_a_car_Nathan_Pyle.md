hi I&#39;m going to start with some
questions are you ready that was the
first question are you ready okay here
we go do you know the middle name of the
person next to you no okay
maybe yes you&#39;re learning it you&#39;re
learning it okay good
second question look down on your hands
look down on your hands are you holding
hands with the person next to you
getting awkward it&#39;s getting a little I
know it&#39;s not awkward it&#39;s good okay
here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to tell you if you
just met someone you usually don&#39;t hold
hands with them right that&#39;s the rule no
one had to tell you that as you left the
house this morning don&#39;t hold hands with
the person next to you that is a rule we
all know there are many rules that we
all know but you don&#39;t know that you
know them and all of these rules I am
calling etiquette say it with me
etiquette okay etiquette there like
manners with all these strangers did you
see that chart earlier today more and
more people are going to live in cities
in the future and it&#39;s going to be more
and more crowded so it&#39;s really
important that we learn how to deal with
strangers people we don&#39;t know sitting
right next to us maybe you&#39;re sitting
next to someone you don&#39;t know right now
maybe you&#39;re getting to know them but we
need to learn how how to have good
etiquette so there are a lot of rules
and I know that you know them because
you&#39;ve seen them broken every day say
yes or no if you&#39;ve seen these have you
ever seen someone standing too close to
you yeah right like maybe on the train
it&#39;s okay to stand close but when you&#39;re
at and you&#39;re when you&#39;re at subway or
Chipotle you don&#39;t have to stand so
close right okay so I started to draw
all these things I saw in the city and I
started to say all right there are a lot
of rules there are dozens there are
hundreds I&#39;m going to put them on the
internet I&#39;m going to put them out there
and see if people agree with me do you
agree with this one
okay good tell me have you seen this one
have you ever seen two people making out
on the sidewalk
yeah oh my goodness right right that&#39;s a
problem if you make out on the sidewalk
someone might steal your luggage have
you ever seen someone spread out all of
this stuff all over the table so you
can&#39;t sit next to them right
excuse me sir there&#39;s three people
sitting there no okay all of these rules
are being broken everyday and you see it
here in New York City or any other big
city I&#39;m going to tell you how to have
good etiquette it&#39;s really simple it&#39;s a
four-word phrase and you are going to
learn how to have good etiquette and
it&#39;s gonna make the world a better place
are you ready here we go
the forward phrase is read it with me
acts like a car it&#39;s really simple four
ways you act like a car here they are a
little icon to each one first way stay
in your imaginary lane stay with me stay
and your imaginary lane really important
have you ever walked behind a group of
really slow people on the sidewalk oh my
goodness right and you can&#39;t get around
them well if the group of slow people
would just make it easier for us to get
around them we could walk faster right
that would be great
they need to stay in their imaginary
Lane have you ever seen someone take
more than two seats on the subway yes
it&#39;s just like somebody who&#39;s parking
over two parking spaces right you need
to take one seat on the subway and put
your bag on your lap right stay in your
imaginary Lane that&#39;s the first rule
second rule are you ready here it is
second rule say it with me once I said
find a good place to stop find a good
place to stop this is really important
here we go if you get a piece of pizza
where should you stand the middle of a
sidewalk no Pablo here is a good example
he&#39;s standing next to the parking meter
so everyone can go around him do you
guys like those $1 slices yes I do too
so we can eat those in peace if we stand
off to the side it&#39;s really not a big
deal
where is the worst place to stop I will
tell you right in front of the subway
right do you see people stop there yes
it&#39;s the worst right yeah it&#39;s terrible
find a good place to stop is the second
rule third rule here we go
eyes on the road stay with me eyes on
the road okay here we go you got to act
like a car have you ever weaved through
a crowd of people yes you feel like a
running back you feel like a superhero
nobody can touch you right let&#39;s because
your focus if your eyes on the road
you&#39;re focused what do you think the
number one distraction is for everyone
in this room phone you guessed it that&#39;s
right so when you have your phone up to
your ear that blocks off one side you
can&#39;t see where you are walking in sight
if you have your phone up to your face
you can&#39;t see anything at all and that&#39;s
how people get hit by taxi don&#39;t do it
right so there are three rules all right
now we have one last one this is the
most important one and it really is
important for many reasons it&#39;s prepared
for impact stay with me prepare for
impact okay you have to assume people
are going to run into you in driving we
call this defensive driving you have to
assume people are going to run into me
so you&#39;ve got to be ready all right here
in the city in a crowded City when
you&#39;re in the crosswalk have you ever
had a car come towards you yeah it&#39;s
really dangerous right it&#39;s because this
guy&#39;s thought thinking about how he
needs to make more money
taxi drivers thinking about how you need
to make more money everyone&#39;s thinking
about something else because you&#39;re
distracted and you&#39;re in a big city you
can get hurt more than that more than
that you might miss something really
important and this is what anyone leads
you leave you with to prepare for impact
you might be missing your soulmate
if you&#39;re looking down at your phone
look he loves fish taco she loves fish
tacos they were meant to be together but
they didn&#39;t see each other because they
were looking at their phone it&#39;s really
sad right fortunately in the book that I
wrote these two find each other in the
end they fall in love it&#39;s good yeah
that&#39;s right
so all you have to do is everyone say it
with me
acts like a car thank you so much
[Applause]
