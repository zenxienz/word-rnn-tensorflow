okay I&#39;m a designer and I build worlds
and in the next few minutes I&#39;ll take
you from the Sex Pistols to Sylvia Earle
from God Save the Queen to God perhaps
can save the oceans but first let&#39;s
start in Borneo I was born far right
outside the status quo a middle-class
baby in an engineering family in Sarawak
the jungle was my playground comfortably
switching between English and Indonesian
my formative years were one big cultural
mashup on one continent and then another
because at the age of seven I began an
even stranger life at single-sex Quaker
boarding schools in England where I&#39;d
see my parents just a few times a year
so imagination was my survival kit every
step of the way so an unusual outsider
childhood followed by politicized
schooling Quaker peace rallies were were
a regular event compounded by the
brewing disgruntlement in 1970s Britain
meant that by the time I entered a
well-respected fine arts college in
london as a painting student I was
already primed for good thorough
disruption it was in the air and then
literally disruption swaggered through
the door I was the social secretary at
college a scruffy kid came in off the
street one day asking join a band to
play for free tomorrow night mate I said
of course the band was the sex pistols
and I just booked their first gig I
walked into their show wearing a button
up jacket and walked out taking a razor
to my hair everything changed overnight
my worldview my aesthetics my desire to
rattle the status quo that I&#39;d already
felt
outside of as a child my art became more
provocative and a teacher tore down my
final show I started working for the Sex
Pistols right away designing t-shirts
led to designing indie magazines and
record sleeves to me and so many others
Punk demonstrated that disruption can
represent powerful change and create
immediate results in the same way that
the Sex Pistols serendipitously walked
through the door so then did Iggy Pop
asking I&#39;ve heard about this thing
called music videos do you know anyone
who could do one I had no idea what a
music video was it was five years before
before MTV but of course I said yes so
some friends and I pulled together the
one filmmaker we knew and a photographer
to do the lighting and when I turned a
refrigerator on its side and stuff Diggy
inside I was suddenly a production
designer one music video led to other
music videos and music videos led to
commercials and commercials led to
feature films and then in 1999 Steven
Spielberg turned my production design
practice upside down he hired a
screenwriter and me on the same day the
film was Minority Report there was no
script and Stephen gave us just a couple
of facts the year of the film was 2050
and there were precogs who could predict
crime before it happened with these two
facts I began imagining a world in which
the film could exist if precogs predict
crime then people would want to be
closer to them so the city would become
more populated which would make the
architecture go more vertical and
perhaps transportation would go vertical
as well and on and on until we created
an entire interconnected ecosystem of
geography politics economics and culture
from which the film organically emerged
from day one my team and I enlisted
cutting-edge experts
in a range of fields science engineering
architecture etc to discover what was
coming down the pike so that we could
envision a future reality another
science fiction and the world we created
from Minority Report indeed gave rise to
new technologies gesture-based
interfaces driverless cars voice
activation flexible displays biomimicry
iris scans 3d video today over a hundred
of the film&#39;s imagine technologies have
been patented so Minority Report was
disruptive in many ways for me the most
profound disruption we&#39;re starting with
the world instead of starting with a
script I quickly realized that this new
design process we&#39;d created world
building could apply to field beyond
entertainment so I think every story
ever told was for humans to make sense
of the world around us originally these
tribal stories were told to help us
survive maybe they should again so we
start with a human at the center and we
look for the logic that threads the
world together good or bad imbalance in
a horizontal slice so through the whole
world space and then we interrogate the
world with a series of vertical dives
pulling core samples of detail from the
parts of the world we need to know more
intimately each vertical investigation
makes the world more robust and more
honest the human stories at the center
of the world find their place in the
community to which they belong and learn
the larger world each scale is
influenced by and has influence on the
other in a fluid nonlinear accumulation
of knowledge we see that by creating the
entire holistic context that surrounds a
problem or a question well building can
work in the service of real-world
problems and real-world impact our
nursing solutions that can be tested
realized provoke people to action and so
I created a design studio 5d a
multi-platform
most disciplined design studio that
practices well building 5g specializes
in designing for immersive experience
driving technologies and generating
stories that have emotion and purpose we
work with a wide range of clients from
the MIT Media Lab to Boeing from Nike to
Intel from the Royal Shakespeare Company
to a Bedouin tribe in the Saudi desert
most of our clients initially view
disruption as launching small changes
not altering their larger framework
helping clients move towards bigger more
challenging impactful world scale
changes is central to what we do and
this disruptive thinking has brought us
together with some profoundly disruptive
collaborators like Sylvia Earle who got
me thinking about the ocean see I told
you we&#39;d get there in many ways the
ocean is the biggest and most
misunderstood client anyone could have
all 93 million miles of her square miles
of her why is it so difficult for people
to understand that our lives that life
our lives humankind depend on the ocean
in essence I think it&#39;s because when
people imagine the ocean they think of
its surface Sun glinting off the water
or what they can observe a few feet
below or on the shoreline it&#39;s not as
though we can take the lid off and peer
inside since most people never go diving
we will have very little frame of
reference for understanding the scale
and nuance and the problems of the ocean
is its depths but what if we could
understand what if we could bring the
experience of a deep scuba dive or
submarine trip to a third grade science
class in Kansas or a museum in
washington what if we could bring
Sylvia&#39;s vision for saving the ocean to
the widest audience possible worldwide
with immersive technologies and
interactive storytelling we can imagine
you put on a virtual reality headset and
a magnificent column of ocean water
forms in front of you
this column a hope spot one of Sylvia&#39;s
marine sanctuaries expands as you reach
your hand towards it you pass right
through and suddenly you&#39;re inside in 3d
and your very own submersible surrounded
by ocean life 360 degrees you can move
down down deeper than even divers can go
you&#39;re surrounded by beauty but soon you
noticed fish caught in plastic six-pack
rings more human trash surrounds you now
your body starts shaking and you hear a
deafening sound you look up massive boat
propellers above your head of thrashing
the water as you move down lower you see
more and more of the oceans degradation
you reach the coral it&#39;s dead but then a
guide beckons you closer she holds her
time light like a flashlight that can
scrub back and forward through time she
waves the time light over the coral and
in a matter of seconds the coral
transforms the ocean transforms becoming
healthy regenerated vibrant and alive
these emergent technologies provide an
unparalleled opportunity to bring this
experience of hope a positive story of
the oceans future to all of us in a
deeply tangible way what if this
experience allowed kids to swim through
their marine biology class tasks we&#39;re
discovering as many coral species as
possible why not let people of all ages
observe an octopus ability to blend with
the ocean floor or be surrounded by
bioluminescent creatures as strange
beautiful and evocative as any science
fiction the outputs of an ocean world
bill can go far beyond this VR
experience for communication across
television film consumer games new forms
of Education data visualizations
advocacy and awareness programs the end
goal remains the same sparking
wonderment and curiosity in order to
inspire common purpose
and creative action for our ocean in the
real world these explorations can
enliven our collective and deep
connection with the ocean it&#39;s deep in
our DNA working together towards
restoring the oceans health will become
a goal that humankind can share I&#39;m a
designer and an optimist I build worlds
and there&#39;s no world more important to
build no story is more important to tell
than those of our ocean for our own
survival on Spaceship Earth thank you
[Applause]
