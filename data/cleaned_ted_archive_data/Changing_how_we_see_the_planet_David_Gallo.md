my pleasure to be here
are one of the greatest mysteries with
you of all time and that could well be
it you know when you think about it how
did this happen how do you lose a Boeing
777 in this day and age when everything
we&#39;ve got all sorts of redundant systems
on the plane networks radars
observations and net the planes nowhere
to be found you know how is it yet and
the thing is you know there&#39;s so much
confusion about what happened to that
plane what&#39;s true what&#39;s not you would I
would go to sleep one night with one set
of facts the next morning they&#39;ve all
been contradicted and you know to me
it&#39;s not just about the plane it&#39;s the
play it&#39;s a great problem great mystery
but this 239 Souls aboard that plane and
for their loved ones for their families
for their friends and for the rest of
the flying public we need to find that
plane you know and so and so that&#39;s a
huge question what happened to Air
France I&#39;m sorry to Malaysian air flight
370 here&#39;s another mystery you know you
take this image for granted but in a way
it&#39;s the same deal a lot of confusion
about this planet you know I&#39;ll tell you
it&#39;s changing there&#39;s no doubt about it
it&#39;s changing faster than we can
understand it and like the case with
Malaysian air 370 there&#39;s a lot of
question is it natural I mean is it a
system problem is it a catastrophe that
we don&#39;t know about or as our humans
involved same thing with the planet and
I can tell you for sure humans are
involved you know we&#39;re involved in this
and despite all of our technology and
we&#39;ve got all sorts of facts all sorts
of data and yet we want to deny it you
know and today I have a hard time with
climate deniers and talking to them from
a scientific point of view I always just
want to use the phrase dumbass all right
come on I mean what the heck p you know
so to think about the planet is that
most of its water i mean you know this
is going to come back to get us in
malaysian air issue 2 but most of its
water 71 percent average depth 22 miles
that&#39;s a lot of ocean water and we&#39;ve
only explored to date about six seven
percent of what&#39;s beneath that ocean
water and when we peek down there it&#39;s
an amazing place we find the world&#39;s
greatest mountain range mid-ocean ridge
50,000 miles long the world&#39;s greatest
underwater valleys the greatest valleys
on earth the most mountain peaks we find
under water rivers we find under water
lakes we find underwater waterfalls the
largest waterfall on earth is beneath
the sea we find more life in the
darkness of the deep sea than we find in
the in terms of diversity and density
than the tropical rainforests and all
that stuff is hard to believe many of
the things we find in the ocean hard to
believe but is really hard to believe is
that at us and this scale you can hardly
see any trace of humanity none at all
and yet like a microbe we&#39;ve met that
we&#39;ve managed to make this planet sick
you know we&#39;ve managed to change the
chemistry and temperature of the
atmosphere and of the sea water and
anyone that has an aquarium knows if you
fiddle with the temperature you fiddle
with the chemistry you&#39;re asking for
trouble and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing
we&#39;re asking for trouble and it&#39;s not
the big events that gets it gets us
that&#39;s going to get us it&#39;s the tiny
things it&#39;s the incremental things it&#39;s
our everyday way of life it&#39;s stuff that
trickles out to the ocean and clear
spring water that rolls out of a
farmer&#39;s field or a golf course or our
city streets because if we go to the
middle of that ocean and take a sample
from a fish that lives there in the
stomach you&#39;ll more than likely find
little bits of plastic and in the flesh
you&#39;ll find things like flame retardants
nutrients fertilizers pesticides all the
stuff that we think is so great for life
we need to change our habits people we
need to do that and you know the other
thing is that the planets great
explorations great oceanography is
wonderful plate tectonics fantastic
climate change the sciences you know
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a wonderful science it
really does work rhythms and cycles but
it&#39;s about the people like air for air
I&#39;m sorry go bare frame
there&#39;s a whole nother it&#39;s like
Malaysia near 370 you know this there&#39;s
7 billion people on this planet right
now many more to come and my fear is
we&#39;re going to screw it up for the rest
of them for the coming generations
mostly because we&#39;re asleep at the
switch not that we don&#39;t have the tools
were just asleep at the switch put it
this way the oceans they provide us with
the air we breathe every other fresh
breath of air you take you can thank the
oceans fifty percent of the oxygen comes
out of the sea the food we eat billions
of people depend upon the oceans for
their food the water we drink and we
just saw a wonderful bit of a film about
water the water we drink most of the
water on this planet you heard it in
that film starts in the ocean and so one
day we said how can it be that there&#39;s
billions of people on the planet that
our water starved and up here we took
all the water off the earth just to see
how much there was the big blue ball
over India is all the water on the
planet the tiny little speck next of it
that&#39;s all the fresh water you can do
that calculation for yourself but it&#39;s
an amazingly tiny bit of water on this
planet incredibly fragile it&#39;s not what
it seems and that&#39;s the case with most
everything we see that you know we tend
to take things for granted that we that
we shouldn&#39;t now we&#39;ll leave you with a
quote by Marcel Proust it&#39;s one that I
live by every day it&#39;s the true voyage
of explorations not so much in seeking
the landscapes it&#39;s in having new eyes
and in this case to me it means it&#39;s not
so much it now that we have the
technology available to us we can go to
the deepest part of the sea go out into
space and look back on the earth we need
to take that information start looking
at this planet differently thank you
very much
ok
