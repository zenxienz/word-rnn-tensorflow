hi everyone I hope you&#39;re having fun
today so any ideas on what this is I
guess you have a hint now yeah exactly
this is a bacterium so it&#39;s invisible to
the naked eye but if we zoom in our view
over 22,000 fold we can see it in a
picture just like this and if they can
see from the scale bar it&#39;s just one
micrometer in length so it&#39;s really tiny
but despite being so tiny bacteria and
other microbes can do really amazing
things they usually have a bad rep right
because they contaminate our food and
they make us sick but there are other
reasons why we&#39;re interested in bacteria
today and other microbes too and the
reason is that they&#39;re redefining the
way that we&#39;re thinking about our bodies
and redefining how we think about what
it means to be ourselves so if you just
take a look at these pictures here it
turns out that our bodies are comprised
of trillions and trillions of
microorganisms that cover every exposed
body site from our skin which is obvious
but also our GI tracts our guts our
mouths and even some of them in our
lungs and so there&#39;s this idea now that
we&#39;ve Co evolved as humans with lots of
different bacteria that are now part of
us and these altogether bacteria viruses
and even fungi and other microbes are
called the human microbiota so these
microbes as I said live on every exposed
body surface but here are some numbers
it&#39;s estimated that in the gut
there are a hundred trillion of them
just bacteria alone not counting viruses
and other things and on the skin one
trillion mouths ten billion and if you
just compare this to the estimated
number of people in the world which is
just seven billion you can see that we
actually have a whole world of microbes
or even a universe of microbes that&#39;s
just inside and on ourselves
these microbes even outnumber our own
cells so there&#39;s so many of them that
it&#39;s estimated that bacteria alone
outnumber our own human eukaryotic cells
ten to one and for every human gene that
we have there are hundreds and hundreds
of microbial genes that we have so
potentially these genes can do a lot of
things for a normal health and disease
so also there are many different types
of bacteria and other microbes too but
just bacteria alone there&#39;s estimated
over 10,000 unique species if we just
compare this to the number of
disease-causing bacteria they&#39;re known
so eighty and only sixteen of which are
considered priority pathogens from the
center of Disease Control what we only
learned in the past five to ten years is
that there are all these thousands and
thousands of bacteria that are in our
normal bodies and we know very little
about what they do so it&#39;s even
estimated this is kind of fun fact if
it&#39;s even estimated if you take all
these microbes on our bodies and pack
them together that they would weigh the
size of a pretty hefty organ up to six
pounds if you compare this brain is only
two point six pounds heart less than one
pound so there&#39;s a lot of potential for
learning about how important these guys
are so many many labs are interested in
microbiota right now and studying all of
the potential ways they can influence
our health and disease and it turns out
that they actually do many different
things so what&#39;s probably most obvious
is microbes which there are a lot of
them in our guts they influence our
digestion how we break down or food and
how we get our nutrients and energy
metabolism but interestingly microbes
also influence our immune systems so
even nowadays or now actually you can
identify scientists can identify certain
bacteria that either promote
inflammation or suppress inflammation
these microbes that can even influence
our responses to medicine so how we
respond to such normal things like
tylenol acetaminophen
and how we break them down and and and
and respond to it and as you can imagine
then there are susceptibilities two
different diseases so I&#39;m a professor at
UCLA and I run a lab and we&#39;re
interested in this particular area of
how microbes can actually impact our
brain and behavior and this is actually
kind of a weird idea first but maybe not
so weird so as anyone ever gotten sick
or food poisoning or something like that
you can immediately feel something and
be your behavioral changes so the idea
that microbes pathogens can affect our
brain behavior is not new but what about
microbes that are in US and on us right
now are they doing anything in terms of
influencing our brain health and disease
so there are a lot of little pieces of
evidence from animal studies that make
us interested in this area they&#39;re
really simple to start and so here&#39;s one
study where in the lab we can take mice
and give them different behavior tests
and here we give a testing mouse the
chance to interact with another Mouse so
to be social and hang out with another
Mouse or to just be in another room that
has a toy a non social object and mice
which are usually social social animals
prefer interacting with the other Mouse
but if you just take away all the
microbes that live in and on this Mouse
you see that we actually decrease
sociability in this white pirate here
and then if you put back the microbes
and then you can increase and make these
back and these mice social again and so
this is really powerful and we&#39;re
studying how which bacteria influence
sociability how do they interact with
each other how do they interact with
neural circuits to influence sociability
here&#39;s another study along the same
lines it&#39;s a really simple one you could
take a mouse and just measure how long
it takes to step down or venture down
from this really tall platform and so
here there&#39;s two different lines of mice
there are two different breeds and one
there&#39;s usually low anxiety so they step
down or jump down from this platform
roll
and this other one is high anxiety so it
takes a long time if we just take their
microbes and swap them what you can see
is that the low anxiety mouse now has
more anxiety so it takes longer to step
down and the other one has high anxiety
now takes the lower time to step down
and so this is where it&#39;s done by
Stephen Collins group and so this is
potentially really interesting exactly
so we are there particular microbes that
we can find that influences behavior and
how do they do it and lastly this is one
work that I did as a student at actually
so we were measuring Mouse communication
so I&#39;m not talking about like squeaking
that you might hear from mice or you
might be imagining but it turns out that
mice talk to each other in the
ultrasonic range kind of like bats so if
we use a special microphone we can
detect all these spectra of mice talking
to each other and in this study what we
did is take a mouse model for a
neurological disorder where in white
here these mice exhibit decrease so very
they give very few calls and they give
very short calls and what we did was we
identified certain bacteria from the
normal microbiome that actually can
correct this deficit and actually make
these mice communicate more so it&#39;s been
really exciting and these are animal
models but what about in humans is there
any evidence that bacteria can influence
brain function or behavior and so here&#39;s
one study this was done by hammer and
Myers beef at UCLA and what they did was
take healthy humans and just treat them
with a cocktail of bacteria of
particular bacteria and then they did
brain imaging so functional MRI to
measure activity in different brain
regions and what they saw is all of
these different brain areas light up and
change in response to just exposure to
different bacteria so there&#39;s some
evidence there that we&#39;re on the right
track where there&#39;s something
interesting and for this biology now
what&#39;s the point so there are lots of
different disorders and all of these
have roots in different areas
immune problems GI problems heart
problems but all of these disorders are
also linked to changes in the microbiota
we know this now that if we profile
individuals with disorders they have
differences in the microbiota and people
our lab included are really interested
in whether microbes are involved in any
of these pathologies or if they&#39;re just
a side effect and there&#39;s some really
exciting work about microbes being able
to treat certain diseases and so we&#39;re
entering this era now of a new line of
treatments where they&#39;re normal bacteria
that potentially imagine if we could
treat people with these they would
colonize they would stay and persist so
you don&#39;t have to keep dosing you don&#39;t
have to do a very invasive treatment and
potentially you can get rid of them
engineer them to target certain places
since different molecules and it&#39;s
really exciting and from brain disorders
this is not this is kind of in the
future but today these types of
treatments are being entered into the
clinic for other disorders like GI
problems and immune problems and so I
think there&#39;s a really exciting future
now of live biotherapeutics or at least
learning from these microbes that are
normally part of ourselves and what they
do on a normal day-to-day basis and so
with that I want to just leave you with
this message that in biology class we
learned that we all live in a microbial
world right that microbes help cycle
nutrients and energy and make our
environment and the earth habitable and
they&#39;re actually a part of you know food
and agriculture and bioremediation but
aside from living in a microbial world
we actually in some ways are in
microbial world we have so many microbes
that are important part of us and this
is a world that&#39;s yet to be explored and
so I hope that some of you might
consider being explorers for this area
of a world that&#39;s invisible to the naked
eye thanks very much
so I have a question for you
so what future technology do you wish
you had right now to help with your
research yeah that&#39;s a really great
question so this area is so new that we
don&#39;t even know how to culture all of
these microbes in the lab and we don&#39;t
know exactly what they do and so a
technology that I would love right now
is what some way to parse all of these
microbes and functionally screen them to
test what they do and in the future
maybe we can then understand what
constitutes something that&#39;s healthy
what some of what constitutes something
that&#39;s unhealthy and have technologies
to actually change or replace or target
certain microbes well thank you
