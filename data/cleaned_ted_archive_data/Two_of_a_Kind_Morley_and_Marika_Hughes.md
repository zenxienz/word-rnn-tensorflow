thank you we&#39;re back there America and I
are back there crying watching these
amazing people tell their stories and
put themselves into the world of such
grace and generosity we&#39;re going to
share a song called two of a kind that&#39;s
inspired by basically feel we have a
global addiction to other in each other
when we learn how to other one another
but once the doors of the heart swing
open there is no turning away as we&#39;re
witnessing tonight today on the stage
hearing Kennedy and Jess the story I&#39;m
so happy to be here with marika Hughes
into the year with you today
[Music]
I have a watch the hands of time take
for me what I call mine and I have bared
it all returned the moment of stillness
and love they first some things are just
made to be some things can&#39;t be denied I
can&#39;t look at you and say goodbye
[Music]
you are trouble and we have met in the
healing day it changes in my some things
are just made to be and I&#39;m stronger
Master Wong understand understand me so
I can&#39;t look at you and say goodbye
so you and me there is no end inside
we&#39;re only part o the same time is fine
for you and me there&#39;ll be no turning
away we filled with love with Ellie Joel
understand me now my love understand me
now my friends mine we pray we will
never have to say goodbye again
[Music]
kinky marika Hughes thank you so much
okay can you believe this beautiful
woman&#39;s voice it just moves me so much
every time and so tell us a little bit
more about the making of that song and
the work you&#39;re doing with young people
i mean i think people think protests
songs are over right that people aren&#39;t
using music for social justice but
morally it&#39;s such an example of using
music your gift of music to create
social justice tell us about the work
well that particular song actually is
inspired by my work with teenagers from
Palestine and Israel I was working in
this program that brought them together
for two weeks and the first four days
they were sitting on opposite sides of
the lunchroom and by the fifth day
they&#39;re developing crushes haha and then
by the end there weeping as we say
goodbye and so it&#39;s just very it just
shows that once the doors of the heart
swing open its we learn how to hate each
other we learn to see each other&#39;s other
in terms of protest music and if it&#39;s
still around I think it&#39;s very alive I
think people like Kendrick Lamar doing
it many many people I could go on but
but my inspiration my main mentors dr.
Bernice Johnson Regan who started quit
honey in the rock and she talks about
the importance of singing to the
condition of the song and so everyone in
here is doing great work and in terms of
doing the work to be in the condition of
the work to work with the people you&#39;re
working with to understand the condition
that the people are coming from two to
take their lead and so for me I take the
lead of the wisdom that&#39;s already in the
room with kids that I work with I always
kind of try to my job is to get out of
the way and let the wisdom of the room
take over everybody&#39;s walking with their
own medicine and it&#39;s the music that&#39;s
taught me and teaches me to how to
listen for that sound try to put into
song thank you morally thank you so much
thank you
you
