heaven there&#39;s the device tell us what
it is it&#39;s a computer the size of a
credit card that you can buy for
twenty-five dollars it&#39;s designed to
plug into your television it&#39;s designed
to plug into your keyboard as you say it
has very little of the features that you
would imagine a computer would have it
is designed to plug into things that you
already own so we&#39;re plug into your
television it&#39;ll plug into whether
that&#39;s an old television or a new
television it&#39;ll plug into a mouse and a
keyboard into a network you store your
data on an SD card maybe that you found
in a digital camera and you power using
the mobile phone charger what is the
probability to try to solve when you
study design this this came out of a
realization we had at the University in
Cambridge that we just weren&#39;t seeing as
many applicants to study computer
science by 2005 content in 1995 when we
had 500 applicants every year for our 80
or 90 places by 2005 we declined to 250
applicants it still sounds good but when
you look at the skills that these people
had when they came in the door you&#39;ve
gone from an environment where pretty
much everyone had done fairly advanced
programming in the being programming
maybe for a decade at the point where
they came in the door at a team to a
world in which many of our clients had
only ever written the web page ord it
was could we make a peaceful first of
all why that happened and our idea was
that the machines of the 1980s those TRS
80 s Commodore 64&#39;s and being the the
environment of which certainly I learned
to program as many of my contemporaries
learn to program and our idea was to try
to build something cheap powerful
available that we could put into
children&#39;s bedrooms so they can have the
same sorts of experiences that we had so
what your thing is that keeps you I was
growing up and getting to university
done to be learnt according to play into
think every computers anymore they
basically download and that&#39;s what I do
yeah absolutely we&#39;ve got a university
we got we&#39;d grow and fat and happy on
this stream of enormously talented and
enormously experienced people people we
could rely that coming the door they&#39;ve
been programming for 10 years and the
first thing we had to do
was convincing they didn&#39;t know
everything and then 10 years later we
found ourselves having to spend quite a
lot of the precious we have 60 weeks the
Cambridge course has 60 weeks to turn
you from a high school student into
somebody who can start a ph.d program
and we were finding ourselves spending
more and more of those pressures 60
weeks on bringing people up to the kind
of level the 10 years before we&#39;ve been
able to assume is this a specific UK
program or a problem what do you think
it&#39;s this brother um our direct
experience has been in the UK but
anecdotally we know this is a problem
that affects the entire developed world
and it really is starting first first it
starts to affect academia three years
later it starts to affect industry if I
look around in a computer office in the
UK these days or in the United States
you find a lot of people in their 30s
you know there&#39;s this sense that the
industry that this pipeline is starting
to dry up for that up late 10-15 years
yeah absolutely and what you&#39;re seeing
is you&#39;re seeing that happen that start
out and 10 years after the machines of
the 1980s very reg these very readily
programmable machines so you turn them
on they go beep and you can start
programming ten years after those
machines started to die out we start to
see our pipeline empty out so in the UK
specificity is a precedent right so it&#39;s
very precedented for computer was put in
the hands of many and you are one of
their generation that learns record on
the computer absolutely so the UK is
kind of an unusual place in that we
pretty much had a state computer you
know I so the british broadcasting
corporation our state broadcaster
sponsor the machine called the BBC
microcomputer produced a large amount of
content back in nineteen eighty one
around this device this was produced
designed and produced in cambridge and
many of us in the 1980s had experience
with that machine in schools they were
pretty much ubiquitous in schools most
schools had at least one or two of these
machines and then lots of us having
experienced them in the school
environment managed to scry remember
scraping together my 220 pounds as an 11
year old to go and buy a second what was
then a very antiquated second-hand BBC
microcomputer that i had so i think four
years let&#39;s see who here has already
opened up a computer and tinkered with
with with one and look some coding
skills
that&#39;s good but half the room
interesting group clearly yeah and and
who knows this device and has had one in
their hands so now 20 people particular
cool okay so tell us a little bit more
about the device it it&#39;s small it as no
no peripheral it is just a few port you
get it what you do what my way somebody
like me should get one and what&#39;s going
to do with it it&#39;s just a pc right just
a is just say a low-power pc that has a
certain amount of that has quite a large
amount of graphical performance and that
was important to us so what we set out
to do we started with the price point we
started with this idea of how cheap can
we make a computer you know we want to
get these into the hands of every child
and so really the the first question
that animated us was you know what can
we ask a child to pay and our idea was
well well in what else can you ask your
child about what else couldn&#39;t school
ask a child to buy and we thought well
schools can ask a child by textbook um
we talked about how much just doesn&#39;t
text me costume you thought $25 now it
turns out that we were really uninformed
about what textbooks cost you know we as
you know we made a rod for our own back
I think if we&#39;d been more realistic
about what textbooks cost me with the
engineering would have been easier but
we really started with that price in
2006 we started with that price and the
whole story of Raspberry Pi has been
about us trying to figure out what we
can squeeze in there and trying to
figure out whether we can squeeze into
that price point something that&#39;s
interesting enough that it&#39;ll get into
children&#39;s lives because we didn&#39;t buy
our computers necessarily in the 1980s
in order to become computer programmers
it was an organic process that started
with people buying computers maybe not
to play games on so this is something
which is designed to be fun to kids but
also just to have that kind of
subversive temptation to start doing a
little bit more than just because you if
you get this into the hands of millions
of kids you can actually probably
inspire more people to to become
programmers in colors again I&#39;m going
forward
1 million more have been sold which
means that many things have been done
with this give us a couple of examples
you must have a long catalog of thing
that has been done yeah actually have
one and the newer copies of Ted&#39;s
running one of the communication devices
you use so I&#39;ll ask but tell us some of
the nice examples of what has been done
yeah so the interesting thing I&#39;m a
software engineer and therefore the
things that I thought people would do
with raspberry pi or software projects I
thought that people would would write
graphics demos right 3d graphics
software like is why I used to enjoy
doing as a child in fact most of what
people have been doing with thee with
the pie is to use this thing here which
is on general purpose io connect and
this allows you to talk to the real
world so what people have been doing
some of the most impressive projects
have been physical projects have been
interacting with the environment there&#39;s
a wonderful guy and the in the south of
the UK who puts these under high
altitude balloons he puts them under
weather balloons with a camera and he
sends them up and he transmits down
pictures from 40 40 kilometers up and
that&#39;s wonderful because I&#39;m a child of
the 80s raddimus real space cadet you
know I remember staying up to see the
first shuttle launch so it appeals to me
the lovely thing about it is that that
the equipment required to do that is
maybe it&#39;s two hundred dollars as
equipment it puts the space program you
go to 40 kilometers and you can see the
curve of the earth and the atmosphere it
puts the space program within the reach
of every of every primary school in the
world and the nice thing about that this
isn&#39;t just about competing anymore this
isn&#39;t just about getting people excited
about competing which was our original
vision this is an outfit getting people
excited about a broader range of what we
call STEM education science technology
engineering mathematics the initial goal
was to inspire kid integrate this into
kids hanjin schools but what you
described are more kind of hackers and
obvious stuff an older age so yeah you
just quit it out yes some people don&#39;t
grow up and so absolutely you know we&#39;ve
sold I think it&#39;s now 1.3 million of
these and the vast vast majority that
let&#39;s say sixty seventy percent I&#39;ve
gone into the hands of technically
literate adults but I&#39;m fine partly
because our thirty or forty percent is
still thirty or forty percent of that
are going into the hands of kids is
still thirty or forty percent of a year
1.2 1.3 million units and for a group
originally planned to sell ten thousand
these are spread news but also the
lovely thing is that these are the
adults who are going to go out into
schools who are going to create the
projects that make this an inspiring
platform for children so I learned from
the scoring wire it should actually
plane to start an educational program
for teachers because getting this kind
of machines into school is the first
step and then you need actually towards
from what you can yeah manage this and I
think you want to do is having them just
store it in a drawer and let them there
yeah so so this is the this is the real
risk that historically in the UK and I
think this is mirrored throughout the
developed world on the government&#39;s have
underinvested in teacher training
there&#39;s under invested in giving
teachers the skills they need in order
to deliver really credible competing
curriculum we can give teachers the
skills required to teach powerpoint and
excel but whether we give them the
skills required to help children who
don&#39;t have this is currently a great
platform for the children of engineers
and a lot of the gillnet self-evidence
you get something like this you yeah
learn how to ya what to do if your
mother or father is an engineer you&#39;re
going to have a great experience to the
pie if your mother or father isn&#39;t an
engineer you&#39;re going to be you&#39;re going
to require a professional somewhere you
can just not necessarily tell you
everything but just get you over those
little bumps in the road so we&#39;re we&#39;re
turning our attention increasingly
towards trying to encourage the UK
government and governments elsewhere to
make those investments or historically
avoid it this is a movement in some
counties about it spreading according
you know from codecademy us to countries
like Estonia which are introducing
according to certain classes as a
primary level as a meritorious here
what&#39;s just take on that yeah I think we
should all copies estonia has been a
Maria it&#39;s an amazing innit it is in a
small country to to make that decision
that you&#39;re going to define coding to be
a basic skill in the same way that we
see language skills and mathematics
skills as being a basic life skill it&#39;s
kind of it&#39;s pretty inspiring at the
moment I think in the UK the US a lot of
this has been done with the voluntary
level so there are a lot of voluntary
organisations like code.org
in the UK code Claude coderdojo so a lot
of this is happening on the voluntary
level I think the real but to to broaden
access to get this outside the usual
suspects to make this something which is
genuinely available to everyone does
require government action are you
keeping every demand we are now keeping
up with demand our first 300,000 units
were sold on the basis of rationing to
one each so I think we were in a squier
and shortage for six months there&#39;s
still a perception in certain circles
that these things were in shortage that
you can now buy them in good numbers and
you started producing it in China and
then you move the products on back to
the UK it&#39;s been an amazing surprise for
us like everyone else when we thought
we&#39;re going to build something cheap and
electronic where we&#39;re going to build it
we&#39;re going to build it in China the
real surprise for us was to discover
that we were able to build this in
bridgend in a sony factory in bridgend
in South Wales about 10 miles from where
I was born for exactly the same price
that we also build it in shenzhen and
that&#39;s absolutely wonderful everything
up something thank you for coming for
said like thank you max you very much
[Applause]
