so I&#39;m going to tell you the most
amazing thing I know which is this
everything in the universe from light to
electrons to atoms behaves like both a
particle and a wave at the same time the
cool quantum stuff I teach my dog
Schrodinger&#39;s cat God playing dice
spooky action at a distance all of that
starts from the fact that everything is
both a particle and a wave but when we
look at the world around us we see waves
in water we see particles of rock
they&#39;re nothing alike
so what bizarre thought process would
make physicists think that these are the
same thing
the answer is surprisingly familiar
we&#39;re led to the dual nature of
everything in the universe by the same
process that you use to solve a
crossword puzzle now I don&#39;t mean
dictionaries full of words sorted by
lengths I&#39;m talking about the puzzle as
a whole those themed clues that go all
the way across the grid and today like a
three word phrase there&#39;s a terrible pun
you you can&#39;t look those up you&#39;re not
going to guess those you have to piece
them together a letter at a time from
the simpler Clues across them and if all
those crossing words fit together you
can be confident that you&#39;ve gotten the
theme clue correct the theme clue that
leads to the dual nature of everything
is what is the interaction between life
and matters the first person to
seriously suggest the dual nature of
light is Albert Einstein in 1905 but he
was picking up an earlier idea from
mocks plonk plonk had explained the
broad spectrum of light emitted by hot
objects through a desperate trick he
said that objects emit light only in
discrete chunks little units of energy
that depend on the frequency Planck was
never very happy with this trick but
Einstein ran with it
Einstein said that light which everyone
knew was a wave is actually a stream of
photons little particles each carrying a
discrete amount of energy I find called
this the only truly revolutionary thing
that he did but it works brilliantly to
explain the way that light knocks
electrons out of metal
even people who hated the idea had to
admit that he had a point so that gets
you three letters towards the the theme
clue about light and matter the next
piece of the puzzle comes from Ernest
Rutherford Rutherford bounced alpha
particles off gold and showed that the
mass of an atom has to be concentrated
inside a tiny nucleus the cartoon atom
you learned in grade school with
electrons going around like a little
solar system that&#39;s Rutherford&#39;s
Rutherford atom has one little problem
though which is it can&#39;t work classical
physics tells us that electrons moving
in circles emit light we use this all
the time to generate x-rays and radio
waves Rutherford&#39;s atom should spit out
an enormous burst of x-rays in a tiny
instant as the electron spirals into
crashing to the nucleus but Nels for
working with Rutherford pointed out that
you know atoms exist and therefore maybe
the rules need to change Bohr suggested
that there are certain special orbits
and in those orbits an electron will sit
happily not emitting any light atoms
absorb and emit light only when they
move between these orbits with the
frequency depending on the energy
difference Bohr&#39;s atom not only fixes
Rutherford&#39;s problem it explains the
specific frequencies of light emitted by
atoms each element has its own set of
special orbits leading to its own unique
set of frequencies again there&#39;s one
little problem with this which is
there&#39;s no obvious reason why these
orbits should be special the final piece
of the puzzle comes from Louise Dubrow
who brought things full circle and he
said that if light which everyone knew
is a wave behaves like a particle maybe
an electron that everyone knew as a
particle should behave like a wave and
if electrons behave like waves it&#39;s easy
to explain the rule that Bohr used to
predict his orbits this is a bizarre
idea it&#39;s also the inevitable result of
piecing Clues together and once you have
the idea that electrons might behave
like waves you can go look for exactly
that by the late 1920s physicists in the
US and the UK had seen electrons
behaving like waves and these days we
have a beautiful demonstration of this
sending electrons one at a time at a
barrier with slits cut in it each
individual electron is detected at a
specific place at a specific time just
like a particle but as we add more and
more and more electrons all of them
together build up a pattern that&#39;s
characteristic of wave behavior richard
fineman famously said that this is
experiment in embodies the central
mystery of quantum mechanics
once you know that particles behave like
waves and vice versa everything else
falls into place like letters filling in
a crossword grid I tell this story not
just because the physics is awesome but
because it illustrates the process of
science most frustrating thing about
being a scientist is that people are
terrified of the subject from outside
science seems like something that&#39;s
beyond the capabilities of ordinary
people right I could never understand
that people say my brain just doesn&#39;t
work that way that&#39;s very flattering to
nerds like me but it&#39;s just not true
science is an esoteric knowledge science
is a process for figuring out the world
you look at the world you think of why
it might work that way you test your
theory with experiments and observations
and you tell everyone the results of the
test this is a process that you use
every day often just for fun it&#39;s what
you do when you work a crossword puzzle
you look at the clue you think of an
answer you test to see if your answer
fits with all the others and if it does
you write it in ink and leave it where
people can see it this process of
scientific thinking has been used by
every human who has ever lived it allows
you to piece together answers to
questions that you can&#39;t get right away
sometimes those turn out to be annoying
puns fitting a puzzle steam sometimes
they turn out to be quantum mechanics
thank you
