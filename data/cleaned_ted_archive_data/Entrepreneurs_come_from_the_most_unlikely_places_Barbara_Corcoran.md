very nice to be here this morning and
I&#39;ll get to started I just wasted 2
seconds I first learned about failure
when I was in third grade it was a
shattering day when sister Stella Murray
the nun from hell slapped me in the face
I should have slapped her back and she
told me if I didn&#39;t learn to pay
attention you&#39;re always going to be
stupid
and so in a world that so narrowly
judges a child by how well they could
read or write I was labeled stupid but I
worked very hard outside the classroom
and I had 23 jobs by the time I turned
22 and I loved every one of those jobs
as menial as I was as they were but what
I didn&#39;t like is having the boss I
didn&#39;t like a single boss they ever
worked for and so at 23 I borrowed a
thousand dollars from my boyfriend at
the diner where I worked as a waitress
and I started a rental company in New
York that rented apartments to people
the way I had it figured it of everybody
that I needed a place to live there are
a lot of people and so I just loved it
from the get-go hopping in and out of
cabs chatting up people opening doors of
apartments and I really really liked
being my own boss I felt like I had been
set free and so I built that company
into the largest residential business
over the years in New York City and
loved every single minute of it and now
what I do is I work with entrepreneurs
trying to help them do exactly what I
was able to do at whatever age they
decide to do it and I do it by way of
this crazy TV show called Shark Tank
which is a wonderful forum to look at
entrepreneurs and decide who you want to
work with and over the six years I&#39;ve
been on the show I have come to the
conclusion that every single one of my
good entrepreneurs who haven&#39;t lost me
money have the same six characteristics
in common and so I&#39;ll share those traits
with you number one resilience the
ability to bounce back they are the kind
of people that when they take a hit they
just don&#39;t feel sorry for themselves
that&#39;s it they bounce back up and almost
have a low enough IQ
say hey guess what hit me again I&#39;m an
asshole a very good example of this is
this lady here yeah oh those are a group
of entrepreneurs sorry I forgot to show
you that slide moving on this lady here
is Kim Daisy and what she does is she
bakes homemade cakes with a mother in
South Carolina and she sells them online
she was selling two thousand cakes a
year when she appeared on shark tank the
night she was on the show 55,000 people
hit her web site and closed it down
within a minute relieving one phone line
that never stopped ringing what did
Daisy Doo this usually demolishes an
entrepreneur when this happens all those
lost sales my god what knock Daisy she
immediately called forwarded her phone
line to my offices in New York and told
me to go out and hire five actresses I
could do a southern accent smart so what
did we do for the next week hello Dave
okay yeah this is Kim Daisy we roll Kim
Daisy and we took 50 how many or maybe
35,000 orders okay and we shipped cakes
for the next six months as people waited
for them amazing walking talking example
of resilience number two
street smarts I don&#39;t mean book smarts a
smarty pants smarts I&#39;m talking about
like street smarts on your feet what do
you do how do you solve it and every one
of my great entrepreneurs have it
cousins Maine lobster I&#39;ll give you a
picture of him here cousins Maine
lobster sells lobster rolls out of a
truck in LA in the first two years in
business built it from one to five
trucks and now they have 17 franchises
as well but what they also did is they
start an online shorter door business
with a ship live lobster anywhere you
order it and they needed publicity to
launch that second business and so they
invited Shark Tank out to witness them
getting an award from the governor of
Maine in their home state for creating
50 new jobs they made that up in
the governor went for it
right but when the Hollywood producer
feeling very self-important came out and
saw the gimmick they had ordered which
was I ordered fifty chef hats for every
one of their employees and I put that in
quotes and they branded on the front
cousins cousins cousins and read the
fancy guy got out there and he said you
know they got to get rid of those hats
this is way way way too much and Sabin
one of the entrepreneurs coolly turns
around he said I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s company
policy we never let our chefs take their
hats off all right smart on his feet
saving is smart on his feet big-picture
thinker is number three I&#39;ve never met a
great entrepreneur who didn&#39;t see from
the get-go the picture where they wanted
to go and seen in living detail when I
first met Tom + Chee they were selling
their business out of a tent in
Cincinnati and what they were selling
were believe it or not they were selling
donuts with grilled cheese on top I
thought hey that&#39;s interesting but they
went on to tell me a living detail what
they were gonna build this giant
restaurant Empire ending with they have
best idea of all they were gonna rival
Disney World and open a table and she
amusement park I thought they were
smoking dope all right
here we are five years later they have a
hundred and seventy five franchisees
five company owner I&#39;m just waiting for
the Noven amusement park I&#39;m sure it&#39;s
gonna happen but they were able to see
it from the get-go and we&#39;re
particularly persuasive and making you
buy in all right seeing the big picture
from the beginning that was number three
number four charisma the most underrated
thing in an entrepreneurs bag of tricks
pipcorn
makes popcorn that&#39;s miniature that
doesn&#39;t get caught in your teeth it&#39;s
owned by these two nice sisters and
brothers sister and brother team out of
Harlem New York City all right what do
they have the brother is great at
finance but jen is the winner
djenka walk into a whole food store get
every customer in that story coming at
her every buyer buyer from her she&#39;s a
phenomenal salesperson I&#39;ve never met an
entrepreneur who couldn&#39;t really sell in
that charisma card is the big gun
that helps them sell that&#39;s what their
gift is charisma number five I mentioned
too early about pardon me I just escaped
on the name I mentioned to you early
about cousins Maine lobster and here&#39;s a
picture of the guys here now and I use
them again for this reason every great
entrepreneur is fiercely competitive
it&#39;s in their DNA you see the guy with
the white hat on there that&#39;s Jim he
used to play professional hockey all I
have to do to Jim to double his sales
and I use it all the time is mention his
old hockey rival Luke from Luke&#39;s
lobster
hey Jim G here Luke opened another
restaurant he goes batches yeah and the
sales go through the roof he&#39;ll work
through the night because he can&#39;t stand
the fact that Luke might be doing better
than him all right
competitiveness you can&#39;t be an
entrepreneur unless you&#39;re fiercely
competitive number six people&#39;s smarts
every great entrepreneur has an
intuitive sense that picks up on what
somebody&#39;s about and they could picture
how they can use them as an employee to
build their business it&#39;s an intuitive
thing I don&#39;t think you can be taught it
it&#39;s just the air every one of my
successful entrepreneurs have that they
always have an uncanny ability to pick
the right people at the right time to do
the right tests and on their backs they
build giant businesses you can&#39;t do it
without it so it&#39;s not easy to build a
business it takes a set of skills that
is a magical set of skills and I&#39;ve just
outlined them and you just can&#39;t buy it
with a Harvard MBA I just don&#39;t think it
can be done whoa
this isn&#39;t about bashing on Harvard MBA
I wish I had one I&#39;d like to show off
with that the rest of my life but what I
wanted to say is most importantly there
are so many kids in our school systems
that are natural-born entrepreneurs with
these naturally born gifts and yet
somewhere along the way they start to
think they&#39;re stupid or not smart enough
to pull something out right I say take a
look at the dumb kid in class because
they just might be the person who is
going to be most successful at building
the next big business thank you very
much
so Barbara its I have a question so how
would I know if I have what it takes to
be if I&#39;m a natural born entrepreneur oh
that&#39;s the setup question by the way we
set this up we did we set this up
exactly here what I&#39;ve been doing for a
last year and a half is working on a
entrepreneur test really quick really
fast it takes about two minutes ten
quick questions multiple choice and I
have it outside if anybody wants to find
out if you&#39;re an entrepreneur but don&#39;t
blame me if you don&#39;t like the results
I&#39;m totally convinced it works I&#39;ve
tested it against my losers my winners
the other sharks who are billionaires
I&#39;m the millionaire and I truly believe
in the test and it just takes two
minutes to take tests thank you thank
you so much thanks for the setup hey
thanks for playing along
thank you
