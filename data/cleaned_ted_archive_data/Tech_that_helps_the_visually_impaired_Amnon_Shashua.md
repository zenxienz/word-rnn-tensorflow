we take for granted in how a good site
some of us have corrective lenses but no
big deal we get used to it but when our
vision gets degraded to a point that no
pair of eyeglasses can fix then we are
visually impaired and we have a problem
now despite the staggering numbers are
about 25 million visually impaired in
the US there&#39;s barely any assistive
technology available there are screens
okay there are screened the magnifying
glasses those are quite limited they
don&#39;t capture the kind of assistance one
needs to carry daily activities for
starters imagine or think about the
amount of textual information around us
billboards street names newspapers books
products on various surfaces and
material then crossing the street
catching a bus purchasing a product and
paying for it these simple activities
for visually impaired person are very
very complex now on the computer
scientists I specialize in a field in a
branch of official intelligence who&#39;s
the aim is to teach computers to see and
understand what they see now how is
computer science related to visual
impairment well my wife and Lily Newman
she lived in New York City all her life
and she had macular degeneration it&#39;s a
disorder that causes the retina to
gradually breakdown I completed my
doctoral studies at MIT and lindy
attended the award ceremony and after
the ceremony she told me now that you&#39;re
a scientist think about a way to solve
my problem you know she was an old lady
and so forth I told her Lily I&#39;m a
doctor but not the kind of helps people
you know I I write equations I write
software to do algebra but you know it&#39;s
stuck in my mind few years ago now that
the ideas truck it may not be possible
to make the
sibility go away but it could be
possible to harness computer science to
compensate for the loss of vision it
means it is within the reach of
Technology of a sinking to develop a
wearable camera that can click on on to
any any pair of eyeglasses and have the
camera figure out what the user is
looking at and have the camera figure
out what the users interested to know
about the scene and provide that
information instantaneously to a bone
conduction earpiece so with the team of
about thirty talented engineers we made
this idea reality and let me show you a
clip that gives you an idea of what it
does
red white green light
okay shackle we should go breakfast
bagel plush coffee with cream cheese and
class on yoga Quino a fresh fruit okay
so what is this it does it continuously
scans the visual field and looks for
familiar patterns that could be faces
hand gestures when the system finds a
pointing hand gesture it tries to match
the scene to what it knows so the system
knows about thousands of raja of product
of a logos and brad names it knows about
buses it knows about the traffic lights
about layout of text in newspaper books
documents and one can teach it new
objects and look look how you teach a
new object to the system of rules
go for cold rock Obama bloom Ringo&#39;s
onion
ok so what what is it does when it sees
a shaking movement it triggers a
learning mode it simply recognizes the
image stores it in memory for later
retrieval as my last slide we have been
able to my people and good Wow so I
chose an upbeat reaction when we have
many reactions or people simply start
crying when they work with the device
let me show you a demonstration I&#39;ll
need to take out the glasses
doing all of this within five minutes
please wait it&#39;s challenging okay and
then you stinker I need the light the
light on okay Oh cam is ready battery is
a tea person charged ok so now I&#39;ll
point sorry this again are escalating on
it stalemate by da the D Kirkpatrick
Cairo the lethal conflicts between
Egypt&#39;s military-backed government in
its different opponents escalated on
Monday good I&#39;m Emma would Sam Soon
George something else okay the lily
passed away ten years ago was too late
for Lily but she definitely planted the
seed thank you
[Applause]
