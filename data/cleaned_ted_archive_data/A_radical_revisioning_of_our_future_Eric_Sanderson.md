it&#39;s great to be here I&#39;m someone who
loves maps and I love Maps because they
help us see the world that we live in
but they also help us see visions of
what used to be and what could be in the
future and this map here is a map of
Manhattan it&#39;s a map from the American
Revolution over 200 years ago and that
little pink bit at the at the end that
was New York City back then but when I
really loved about this map where the
hills and the streams and the wetlands
that we realized we could lay on top of
that the buildings of the city like this
so we could see what was really
underneath the city and then reconstruct
the ecology of what was once there when
it looked like this a landscape of
forests and wetlands and wildlife that
covered the whole island of Manhattan at
the moment right before Henry Hudson
arrived in 1609 and this map gave us a
vision of what the past was like a past
that we can compare with our present and
though there&#39;s many wonderful things
about New York City and Manhattan today
one thing that it isn&#39;t is as
sustainable as mannahatta was mana hot
does the green part you see on the left
Manhattan is the part on the right and
by having two visions and seeing the
world in this kind of two vision way we
can start to understand better the place
we live and of course it helps us see an
alternative to the way we live today
toward the end of the book that I wrote
about this I was thinking about well how
do we make New York City more
sustainable if we were trying to imagine
what New York was going to be like four
hundred years from now Henry Hudson
comes in 1609 the book comes out in 2009
what&#39;s 2409 going to look like and I
worked with a designer and we thought
about it and we came up with this image
of New York City so this is the same
number of people that living in only
thirty-seven percent of the area using
the density of Manhattan Island and the
water&#39;s come up with the sea levels
raised a meter because we know that
climate change is happening and what you
see our farms and wetlands and streams
and I would give talks like this and
people like you people at kids
would say well how do you know that&#39;s
going to be better I mean what are you
trying to do with this vision and my
vision was a city without suburbs the
city without cars the city without
fossil fuels and all the pernicious
things that come with that and study a
city&#39;s it has farms and streams and
light rail and ways to get around and
people would say well that&#39;s your vision
but what about my vision and I was like
you&#39;re right I mean no one of us owns
the future we&#39;re all working together to
create the future of our city and of our
planet so working with someone Hollings
we created this new website that allows
you to create the future you lease to
share to create and share your vision of
the future and it&#39;s completely free it&#39;s
called mana hot to 2409 org you log on
and it&#39;s sort of a combination of
wildlife conservation and Facebook and
minecraft all together right so what you
do is you make your vision you give it a
name you can write a description to what
you want your vision to be like you can
assign it a year so if 2409 is too far
you can imagine a hundred years from now
or five years from now or next year we
can even imagine the past if that&#39;s what
you want and then it asks you what
ecosystems do you want to start with you
want to start with the mana hata
ecosystems or do you want to start with
the ecosystems of today and these are
the ecosystems of today and kind of
looks like minecraft right every color
is a different ecosystem it shows you
how those ecosystems lie on top of the
old ecosystems to the island where the
greens are forests and wetlands and
streams and then it gives you these
tools over here that allow you to change
the ecosystems change you can change the
buildings you can build stadiums you can
have wetlands or forests you can build
big avenues or streets or you could have
streetcar lines all the kinds of things
that we think about all the sort of
options we have in the city what&#39;s also
true about cities is they have different
lifestyles so there&#39;s a life style
selector who&#39;s going to live in your
city of the future and we have five
lifestyles right now we have the average
New Yorker we have an average American
we have an average earthling we have
allen op a person standing on Turtle
Island there
and we have what we call eco hipster
which I&#39;m sure is all of you so an eco
hipster is like an average New Yorker
but someone who&#39;s making choices to try
and reduce their environmental impact
and of course we also know what we think
about the future that we have to keep in
mind how the climate is changing so we
also have a climate selector you can
choose the climb into the past the
climate of what we have today which is a
little bit warmer and the sea levels
come up or you can imagine more warm
more water warmer still the more water
warmer still and yet more water because
the water is coming up there&#39;s nothing
we can do to stop that from happening we
can only adapt to what the future is and
that&#39;s a really important question about
how we imagine the future and then you
see these metrics of how your vision
perform against mana hata there we go
against New York City today and this is
your vision in the middle this gold line
here and we have four categories of
metrics we have the water cycle the
carbon cycle biodiversity and population
so what kind of vision is to people
create oh and I should say when you get
a vision you like sand you can share it
with everybody else so you can make a
vision that goes back in time to mana
haha you could have a vision of what New
York City is today you can imagine a
suburban New York right maybe this is
the way you want Wall Street to look
like in the future or you know when you
really ask people some people have these
ideas about zombies in their head so you
can have that too you can make that
vision you can imagine New York City
being bigger than it is but in fact when
most adults use it this is what you get
what you get this is what the kids do
the radical vision and the adults do
this the kind of usual vision you know
we talk about green roofs or bios well
and they&#39;ll paint one right on top of
their building but what we really need
is a way to have the usual radical
that&#39;s the way we imagine the future
that&#39;s how New York City gets built and
in a world that&#39;s rapidly urbanizing
with a populations growing it&#39;s really
important to find ways for that&#39;s all to
work together The Skeptical the intrepid
and the imaginative to create the cities
of the future thank you very much
