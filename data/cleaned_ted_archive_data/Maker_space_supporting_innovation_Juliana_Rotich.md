I&#39;d like to tell you a little bit about
my grandmother Google Martina chela got
to is my grandmother and the word Google
is an affectionate way of saying
grandmother in my native language my
grandmother lived in a time where there
wasn&#39;t much her house was lined with
clay that she would find in rivers to
insulate it and the life that she used
in her house was basically candles and
kerosene and this is the type of energy
that she used in house for most of her
life she lived in a world that she
didn&#39;t have much but then this did not
bother her this is my grandmother with
my niece notice what she&#39;s holding and
that&#39;s a piece of twine that she would
rub together to create a kind of thread
and then she would use that thread to
weave beads into necklaces into jewelry
into functional objects like this gourd
so if you notice this is the work of her
hands with the beads and the different
colors and this she made the marks with
a piece of metal that she she would put
in hot coal to create just the simple
fractal-like designs she lived in a time
where for something to exist you
actually had to make it with your own
hands and she also lived in a time where
you had to fix things with whatever was
on hand she was always reusing
containers recycling and I would see
these small things in her kitchen and in
her house where she would just reuse
things there was no waste in her house
and in her when she passed away and I
was thinking about her and I realized
that she was not just my grandmother she
was also a maker and the idea of the
maker movement a
as intertwined in African culture and it
is old as time itself so when I thought
about this how do we tap into the
African maker spirit and if we&#39;re daring
enough can we tap into this so that we
can create not just for Africa but but
for the rest of the world with the
spirits of Google and some of these
thoughts around making I look into the
work that I&#39;m doing right now with OSHA
he and the team that we work together
globally so OSHA he D is a global
organization that started in Kenya and
for me when we started around
collaborating creating software for
crowdsourcing information but then it&#39;s
grown it&#39;s been five years now and it&#39;s
starting to exemplify and create that
bridge between the idea of Africa and
the idea of the technology world it&#39;s a
connection and it actually showed that
things can come out of Africa and spread
towards to the rest of the world so
things can scale we&#39;ve been able to
leverage this idea of open source
community and innovation and to have the
platform being used around the world in
over 30 countries in over 150 countries
and in its been translated into more
than 30 languages and it also became a
catalyst for other initiatives including
the ihub which is a space where
technologists can grow businesses they
can connect with each other they can
have access to knowledge to connections
to investors and also to mentors and
this includes women by the way they&#39;ve
been more than 11,000 members and this
is the apartment parcel of the emerging
story of Africa and this idea spread not
just from there it spread from Nairobi
to places like Lusaka Zambia to Nigeria
to come Arun to Ghana
so there&#39;s this up swell of talent in
the software space and this story of
making things particularly in the
software space with mobile applications
is growing and this talent there there&#39;s
more that we can tap into in this space
one of the things that we realized that
even though we had some success in
spurring the startup culture in the
software space and mobile application
space with an example of Kenya where we
had startup we had 15 startups in 2010
and now more than 48 startups after 2012
is that there was something missing what
was missing is the space a space like
the ihub but for makers that taps into
the maker spirit to make actual physical
objects so there&#39;s a lot that we&#39;re
doing in this the software spaceship but
we were not seeing startups in the
hardware space so we created this idea
of gearbox and we did not wait for
resources we do not wait for grants
we&#39;ve already started bring together
artists engineers like Juliette one year
e to collaborate and to start making
things we&#39;re also putting together kids
maker camps and hacker camps to teach
them how to program using scratch a
programming language out of MIT Media
Lab how to program raspberry PI&#39;s and
Arduino and let me tell you something
when it comes to making things in Africa
particularly in East Africa it&#39;s not
easy and we realized this when we
started to create a product called the
brick and the brick is a redesign of the
modem that takes into account the
current reality in east africa where we
have frequent power blackouts it&#39;s very
annoying and reliable connectivity and
challenging environments so we looked at
the modem which is a very important
device for us who are very dependent on
the internet and said how can we
redesign this so that it can work
better for our environment and so it
came up with the break and the break is
how many it&#39;s a cool device because it
can do two things it can connect people
it can create a Wi-Fi hotspot for up to
20 people and you can create also an
ad-hoc network so you can see how this
can be used in a rural setting for a
school where content can be shared but
the cooler part of the brick is the fact
that it has GPIO pins which can be used
Kinect sensors and this idea that you
can the brick can be an on-ramp for the
internet of things so you can instrument
things you can program and send commands
through the brick to turn on a light to
connect a weather station and do other
conscious things that we haven&#39;t thought
about yet it is simply a backup
generator for the internet and one of
the things that we realized with this is
that entrepreneurs and makers need
opportunity they need a community they
need investment most of all they need
most of all they need a space where they
can collaborate with each other to make
more things so when we think about why
should we invest in the idea of a maker
industry turns out that the correlation
between investing in this industry and
an increase in GDP and the same thing is
also apparent when you invest in
connectivity so it&#39;s worth doing this to
create a space for making of physical
objects and to try and scale that
because like I said before with all
these centers places like that I have
been Africa the talent is there but the
opportunity is not and those centers are
providing a place where entrepreneurs
have a chance but right now what we&#39;re
seeing is there isn&#39;t much of a chance
for innovators and inventors to make
things like the brick and we need to
create this and 22
make the space for this the other thing
about this is that once we can create
the space in Africa that these ideas can
also scale I look back to the work that
we&#39;ve done with OSHA Headey and realized
that innovation can scale we still joke
about the fact that if it works in
African can work anywhere and we see
this with OSHA headey platform which is
one of the first products that the OSHA
ad team put together and it&#39;s been used
to map crises from Haiti to Japan to map
protests in ukraine to map elections in
kenya and even human rights in Syria so
these things can scale the question is
how do we support entrepreneurs to help
them get to the next level how do we get
them there we can start by investing and
creating the space for them to play to
realize and to tap into the maker spirit
because if we do this we can tap into
that inventiveness the making the fixing
and if we do this Africa can truly
emerged as an innovation engine for the
world thank you
you
