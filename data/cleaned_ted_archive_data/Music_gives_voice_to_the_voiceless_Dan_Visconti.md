Thanks ever since I first began
composing music I&#39;ve always felt that
building new audiences requires updating
the very idea of the composer from
someone older guy with wig and a quill
pen who&#39;s labouring away in isolation to
a cultural ambassador and a collaborator
who&#39;s deeply integrated in the
communities that he or she serves I
compose music for symphony orchestras
and string quartets but I grew up
listening to all kinds of great pop and
folk music too and I&#39;m constantly
bringing that same directness of
expression and sense of fun to my own
compositions I want you to hear the
chamber ensemble Sybarite five
performing some of my music now but I
also want you to see the freedom and
excitement that the performers are
bringing to the experience
there&#39;s such a great energy and this
really spirited sense of rapport in this
performance and especially here at the
end of the clip you can just feel how
involved audience has become in the
musical journey so the more I thought
about it I realized that classical music
didn&#39;t just need new cool pieces of
music but new ways of presenting
concerts not as isolated events of high
culture but as points of inquiry for
engaging larger community issues just
this past week I attended the premiere
of my new project for City Music
Cleveland an orchestra that presents
free concerts and accessible venues city
music commissioned me to create an
extended work inspired by the stories of
some of the city&#39;s nearly 20,000
refugees
so I created a concert work from the
refugees diverse experiences and forged
partnerships with local historical and
cultural organizations to present a
week-long festival of music and
storytelling including musicians and
dancers for many of the refugees home
cultures music as a means of giving
expression to social issues it&#39;s always
been a big part of social change and
it&#39;s by giving expressive voice to those
who often feel voiceless but real
awareness and understanding can be
achieved it was a thrill to see the city
music project encourage children as
young as six years old to create musical
histories of their own families and in
doing so to see music assume a
functional role beyond mere
entertainment the city music project
also created an infrastructure for
innovation by building a network which
previously disparate refugee groups
could come together the project also
aided in identifying strong visionary
community leaders from within the
refugee population many of whom assumed
greater leadership roles through their
participation in the project
it&#39;s by this kind of community
engagement and by composing music that&#39;s
open to a diversity of traditions the
classical composers have a chance to
reinvent their role from the 21st
century by connecting to musics
incredible ability to share our stories
with others my music builds on the
traditions of our many cultures and
envisions new ways that music can play a
role and exploring our world and each
other
thank you
