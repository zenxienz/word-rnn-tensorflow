thank you great so I thought it was
interesting that general McChrystal said
that sharing knowledge is power it made
me realize that perhaps my army of
Wikipedians is the most powerful army in
the world
so who knows so I&#39;m actually not going
to talk about the people&#39;s operate I
think I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t she didn&#39;t get
the information the people&#39;s operator is
my new baby but you can look it up
online not right now I&#39;m talking so
right so the original vision for
Wikipedia is for all of us to imagine a
world in which every single person on
the planet is given free access to the
sum of all human knowledge and this has
been the core of our work it&#39;s what we
do is what we&#39;re trying to do all the
time and we&#39;ve come a long way so far at
both wikipedia and wicked that my
for-profit company that has a broader
range of information sharing sites five
hundred thirty two million people a
month visit Wikipedia a hundred nine
million at wikia thirty eight thirty
point eight million entries in wikipedia
and actually thirty three million in
wikia wiki is actually larger than
wikipedia this is partly though because
we have sites like the Muppet wiki which
I think has about 30,000 articles about
the Muppets so they&#39;re not all as
heavily read as Wikipedia entries so but
what is next and what is really big is
is mobile and I think in this crowd of
course a lot of people will already know
this but I think even in this crowd even
people in my industry often aren&#39;t
realizing how fast this is happening
today and what&#39;s what&#39;s really going on
so what you need to know or here&#39;s what
here&#39;s what you know people if you say
somebody mobile in Africa let&#39;s say oh
yeah yeah subsistence farmers can text
and find out crop prices or they&#39;ll say
yes I saw cell phones they&#39;re reporting
malaria outbreaks in there and they&#39;re
doing this kind of thing and all of
that&#39;s true but it clouds your mind if
that&#39;s your if that&#39;s your model for
thinking about mobile in Africa you&#39;re
missing something really important
that&#39;s going on here&#39;s what you probably
don&#39;t know this is a phone that I used
for a year I just stopped using it
recently and it&#39;s it&#39;s about this big
it&#39;s a small little phone and it costs
today about fifty dollars in Africa it&#39;s
an Android phone and you know it has
apps and it does everything
battery lasts for two days which is
pretty impressive and this is not the
only one there&#39;s other phones coming
onto the market now for as low as forty
three dollars and they&#39;re selling
hundreds of thousands of these phones
millions of these phones will be sold
very soon and very very soon in three to
five years hundreds of millions we&#39;re
gonna see that a majority of people in
Africa have smartphones within five
years and what are these people doing
when they get on these phones are they
searching for you know better crop
prices or the reporting malaria
outbreaks yeah maybe but what they&#39;re
really doing is they&#39;re going on Google
Facebook Wikipedia and of Twitter
Twitter Wikipedia local newspapers
they&#39;re doing all the same things that
we all do they&#39;re joining the global
conversation in a massive way and so for
us what&#39;s been really exciting is we&#39;ve
got a program at Wikipedia called
Wikipedia zero where we&#39;re working with
the mobile carriers in the developing
world to bring Wikipedia to people free
of data charges and we&#39;ve been so
successful at this we now have about 500
million people theoretically have access
to Wikipedia now I say the word
theoretically because not all of them
have smartphones yet but the deals are
in place and it&#39;s there so our next
steps focusing on usage and what&#39;s
really interesting is that a lot of this
is being driven by demand from consumers
we had a group of young kids who on
their own started a petition to ask
their local phone companies to provide
Wikipedia for free and I&#39;m going to show
you a video of these kids which i think
is pretty amazing every time they show
this at the office somebody has to leave
that I&#39;m crying so I hope I hope you
feel the same way it&#39;s quite amazing me
and Mike
my classmate wrote to accessory to PDF
for free it goes as follows open letter
to solve filled empty L for the comp and
a time we are Lina&#39;s in Brecht off at
cylinder high school Joe Slovo path
bulletin kept out we recently had but in
some other African countries like Kenya
and Uganda cellphone providers are
offering they are customers free access
to Wikipedia we think this is a
wonderful idea and would really like to
encourage you also to make the same
offer here in South Africa our school
does not have the library ninety percent
of us have cell phones but it is
expensive for us to buy item so if we
could get free access to Wikipedia it
will make a huge difference to us no
matter when we do research Wikipedia is
one of the best site and there is
information on just about every topic
the think of the boost that it will give
us as students and to the whole
education system of South Africa our
education system needs help and having
access to Wikipedia would make a very
positive difference thank you thank you
thank you thank you
thank you thank you thank you thank you
and was thanking
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and the student of students over high
school in Capeside you recently shared a
video asking South Africa&#39;s cellular
networks to give their customers free
access to Wikipedia we think this is a
wonderful idea we know that many school
children in this country don&#39;t have
access to research material which can
make excel cuts for so much more
difficult
that&#39;s why India is proud to be the
first South African cellular network to
make Wikipedia

thank you
