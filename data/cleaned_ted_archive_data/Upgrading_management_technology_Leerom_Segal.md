let me ask you a deceptively simple
question what would happen if companies
understood their own employees better
than they understand their customers and
it&#39;s a deceptively simple question
because we intuitively know both the
answer and the benefits it&#39;s actually
why Amazon does such a good job of
showing us what we&#39;re interested in why
Facebook curates our newsfeed for
individual relevance and why
applications like Spotify and Netflix
are actually differentiated and
algorithms that are learning our
preferences to customize our experiences
in fact at home we have choice and so we
choose to do business with companies
that have really figured out how to
personalize their news shopping
entertainment travel and other needs but
then we go into work and at work it&#39;s
all one size fits all policies processes
and tools the results is an epidemic
that isn&#39;t getting nearly enough
attention now over the next few days
we&#39;re going to hear about some of
humanity&#39;s most important and complex
issues and whether your issue is climate
change world hunger education or
anything else I&#39;m going to propose that
a precursor to effectively addressing
any of these issues its first addressing
this 70% of workers today are disengaged
at work and it&#39;s going to require people
at work to solve all these issues these
people will be parts of organizations
and these organizations are going to
have managers and management is a
technology now when we think about
technology more broadly we&#39;ve made
incredible progress over the last 100
years think about the state of Medicine
automotive aerospace high-tech think
about the progress we made in the last
hundred years and contrast that with
work then and now
in fact if you in fact if you consider
the fact that over the last hundred
years technology has radically
transformed industries and you contrast
that with the fact that the technology
of management has simply not kept pace
in other words business is rapidly
involving and worked as not if we were
to take apart this pie chart and replace
the word email with memo this could
represent the life of a worker one
century ago and it&#39;s frustrating because
we all know what a great day feels like
a day where you&#39;re able to keep the most
important thing the most important thing
that indescribable feeling that sense of
accomplishment that comes from having
spent a day in the state of flow that we
all love these processes they leave
sparse time for people to experience the
state of flow and they interrupt us all
too frequently
consider for example annual performance
reviews of frustrating relics from our
agrarian roots if I were to ask
everybody here what&#39;s wrong with them
everybody here would have an opinion
we&#39;d all be right 98% of us do them
97.2% of us think that they suck and
fifty and fifty eight percent of the
people that design and agree that they
suck but we still do them we still do
them this is what training looked like
50 years ago this is what training looks
like today it&#39;s a little bit on spirit
because we&#39;ve put it on the screen but
fundamentally it&#39;s still one size fits
all and a point-in-time approach in
organizations today we&#39;re drowning in
process we process for everything we
process for planning and process for
budgeting process for performance
reviews process for approvals we have
process to change process and process to
communicate and train on the now change
process it&#39;s too much and it&#39;s like this
plaque that&#39;s clogging organizational
arteries consider the alternative
process doesn&#39;t need to be static and
experiences a good predictor of risk
there is no reason that the hundredth
time and the first time that anybody
does anything the process should be the
same the first time is a teachable
moment and a teachable moment is a great
opportunity to pair somebody with an
expert to provide a training
intervention at a time when they&#39;re
going to get the practice and feedback
they need to learn but as people
demonstrate complex
can we relax the bureaucracy and
increase the speed and this is
infuriating because we solve this
problem in our personal lives at home
were used to technology acting like a
coach and helping us who in this room
hasn&#39;t used a mapping application to
coach you on how to go anywhere new the
first few times we rely on health
trackers to help us achieve our fitness
goals or in my case gently nudging me to
eat less move more sleep and smile and
our research for the dakota company we
were encouraged to see a whole new wave
of innovation companies taking
inspiration from the consumer landscape
and pulling it into the workplace
collectively what all these companies
are doing is actually shifting the data
lens inward to better enable and empower
their own people now in the
high-performance world the Formula One
racing Ferraris actually been doing this
for a very long time they were the first
one to build one of these on the screen
is a sensing and actuating center and it
will analyze billions of data points in
real time during a race so that they can
coach the drivers by whispering in their
ear things like you can skip the pit or
go harder on the brakes UPS has a
program called Orion where they&#39;ve
collapsed 80 pages of math into a
heads-up display that the drivers used
to pair their instincts and experience
with real-world analytics the results of
the drivers are getting home earlier to
see their families mileage is down which
is good for profits in the environment
customer satisfaction is actually up and
they&#39;ve been saving lives through an
insight that they didn&#39;t have which is
most accidents were happening during
left-hand turns so what&#39;s next a hundred
years ago Henry Ford said that if you
ask people what they wanted they would
have set a faster horse well email is
the ultimate faster horse even a
language of carbon coffee simply a
digitized memo but what makes it worse
is it gives us the illusion that we&#39;re
going faster while actually allowing
others to reprioritize us fortunately
we&#39;re seeing consumer-to-consumer like
applications built for the enterprise
space companies like asana in the
collaboration space companies like
meeting hero and do calm doing the same
in the meeting space adding structure
and feedback loops so we hope we&#39;ve
piqued your curiosity because these
ideas are universal we hope that you
think about your tools but more
importantly think about your thinking
because Einstein said that today&#39;s
problems cannot be
of the same thinking that created them
well the technology of management got us
this far but it&#39;s going to require
progressive and empathetic leaders
combined with the right tools to
reengage that 70% so that collectively
we can work on all the important issues
we&#39;re going to hear about here on the
Ted stage thank you
