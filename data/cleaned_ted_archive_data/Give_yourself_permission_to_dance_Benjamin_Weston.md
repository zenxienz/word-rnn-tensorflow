I want to bring to your attention a
global pandemic that is being completely
ignored and one that no one believes can
be solved countless men around the world
believe they cannot dance a year ago one
of those men came to me he&#39;s in his
fifties married and during our first
lesson together I asked him why he
wanted to learn to dance he said my wife
and I have been married for 25 years and
I love her just as much today as the
first day that I met her I would do
anything to make her smile but when we
go out together and there&#39;s dancing
involved I immediately feel
self-conscious and have no idea what to
do with my body I just want to be able
to go out and have fun dancing with her
not long after he went out dancing with
his wife and so that for the first time
ever he felt as if he had permission to
move how he wanted to move he sounds
good he looked good his wife loved it
tonight I want to show you just how easy
it is for any man to enjoy dance like
that this first step changed my life
this is the move you do when you walk
into a club your friends are beckoning
you to come down and you&#39;re thinking to
yourself I am way too sober for this
nope this is the movie do when you&#39;re
dancing it from that gorgeous creature
your mind is racing to think of the next
move to do and you suddenly realize
you&#39;ve already used up all two of your
moves ten minutes ago may I present the
two step step to the right feet touch
step the left feet touch that&#39;s it the
two steps all right right about now most
of the man this room have the exact same
question but what do you do with your
arms
the first thing you&#39;re going to do is
pull your hands out of your pockets and
stop hiding behind your drink because
the most confident and powerful version
of you is not going to be hiding now as
for our movements my personal favorite
is a little old school ok I can hear you
guys laughing see you some of you
smiling if that&#39;s because the thought of
doing this feels a little silly or goofy
that&#39;s ok because just smiling will
automatically make your dancing look
better but the real power in the two
steps is not in the move itself the
magic comes when you add flavor flavor
is making the move your own it&#39;s moving
according to how the music makes you
feel if it&#39;s playful to set playfully
if it&#39;s sensual to substantially
if its aggressive make it aggressive
Samba take a simple move and add your
personal flavor to it that&#39;s what makes
you look good on the dancefloor not the
moves you do for showing who you are
drew them because in the end dance is
just your presence to a beat you don&#39;t
need fancy moves to look good you just
see the show up fully as yourself and
that&#39;s what makes dance so scary and so
necessary men learn to dance is more
than just learning to look good in front
women and friends it&#39;s about becoming
the superhero version of yourself
because when you dance it takes courage
to honor and Express every facet of your
being for everyone to see you become
pure joy you become your sexuality boom
you become your powerful aggression when
you dance you Unleashed the sublime
version of you you are not only
affecting changing yourself you are
creating waves of positive karma that
ripple among everyone around you and all
it takes is starting with simple shoes
up and a little bit of flavor thank you
is
