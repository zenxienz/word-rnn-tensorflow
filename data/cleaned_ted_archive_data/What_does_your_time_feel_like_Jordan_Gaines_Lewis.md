when I was jumping my car battery in
January after being slammed with
sub-zero temperatures I was pretty
convinced summer would never get here
but here we are clamoring for any
air-conditioned building in sight even
though it seems like just yesterday we
were all rattling on about the polar
vortex it&#39;s strange right as a kid the
space between winter break and glorious
summer freedom seems like a lifetime but
now as adults will blink and suddenly
it&#39;ll be time for us to start sending
Christmas cards again it&#39;s become a
common complaint a joke really that time
seems to whiz by faster and faster as we
get older of course aging doesn&#39;t grant
us the power to disrupt the space-time
continuum so it&#39;s not a real problem but
why do we perceive it to be the 19th
century psychologist William James mused
over this fact in his text principles of
psychology James wrote that as we age we
find ourselves stuck in a routine this
causes he writes the days and weeks to
smooth themselves out and the years to
grow hollow and collapse very depressing
I&#39;m working on my PhD in neuroscience
and the most fascinating aspect of human
behavior to me has always been how we
perceive the world around us perception
is more than just how we spent our
surroundings it&#39;s how our past
experiences and biological differences
interact creating unique interpretations
for every new experience even though
we&#39;re all sensing the same things in
this moment each of us perceives it very
differently
a decade ago German psychologist Mark
Whitman decided to study how different
people perceive the passage of time he
recruited 500 participants ranging from
tweens to centenarians and presented
them with all sorts of questions and
rating skills unsurprisingly regardless
of age he found that everyone felt that
the last few weeks and months had
whizzed by in a flash
however longer intervals of time such as
decades we buy much faster for those
aged 50 and older than for younger
people last year researchers in u.s.
Australia and Japan decided to study
exactly why certain types of people
perceive these longer time intervals to
be passing quickly and they found
something interesting those who had
perceived a high level of day-to-day
stress in the past but not currently
felt that the last decade had passed in
a flash so I find it fascinating that
although the workday grind may feel
slower than molasses in January will one
day look back when we&#39;re older or
retired and our perception will
completely change that time period will
say what&#39;s right through our fingertips
the results from these cross-cultural
studies tell us something else
interesting we&#39;re all in the midst of an
international crisis and there&#39;s not
enough time to solve it so what&#39;s the
deal
the complexity of human biology behavior
and personal experiences make this line
of research particularly tricky what
psychologists have put forth five
interesting theories to explain the
strange phenomenon the first is that we
gauged time by memorable events imagine
a middle-aged working parent explained
this experiencing the stressful drudgery
of work and family life the abundant
memories of high school such as
homecoming football games prom
graduation and so forth may seem like
much longer than the mere four years
that they were the second is that the
amount of time passed relative to one&#39;s
age varies when you&#39;re five years old
one year is twenty percent of your life
but when you&#39;re 50 years old one year is
only two percent of your life
we may be constantly comparing intervals
with time with the duration that we&#39;ve
already lived third with aging they come
the slowing of some sort of pacemaker in
ourselves relative to the unstoppable
clocks and calendars our bodies may be
telling us that it&#39;s literally time to
be slowing down fourth as we age we may
be paying less attention to time when
you&#39;re a kid on December 1st you&#39;re
faithfully counting down the days until
Santa brings your favorite hot wheels
down the chimney but when you&#39;re an
adult on December 1st you&#39;re a little
more focused on work fill deadlines
Christmas shopping and travel plans the
more attention we focus on tasks and
routines the less we notice the passage
of time this stress the feeling about
there&#39;s simply not enough time to do
everything we want to do May as we&#39;ve
seen be reinterpreted into the feeling
that time is passing too quickly so what
can we do about all of this we all know
the thing time flies when you&#39;re having
fun after all I&#39;ve never sat through a
particularly enlightening trigonometry
lecture and thought to myself wow this
cost is going so quickly so the key is
to keep your life is dull as possible
just kidding actually the complete
opposite is true regardless of how we
each experience time we all hope for one
thing in life to wake up each morning
and feel energized so create variety in
your routine find something that
inspires you every day pursue the things
that interests you make exciting plans
for the future and savor all moments
begin small if time can be on Mick
Jagger&#39;s side I can certainly be on
yours too thank you
