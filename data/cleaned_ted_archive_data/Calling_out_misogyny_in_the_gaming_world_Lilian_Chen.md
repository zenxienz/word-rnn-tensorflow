hi qicang house is my family-owned
Chinese restaurant in Willimantic
Connecticut where I spent nearly 20
years growing up before II sold it
my brother and I spent most of our time
in the room in the back called the
office the office was fairly just a
storage room but it had our gaming
systems and the game that we play the
most was called super smash brothers
melee for those who don&#39;t know super
smash brothers melee is an older
fighting game made for the Nintendo
GameCube my brother and I spent hours
playing this game so much that we even
challenged restaurant customers to
matches eventually my friends dragged me
out to a local tournament where I ended
up placing 13th out of 33
not bad but definitely far from the best
after training with higher level players
and taking notes on matches I found
online I started to travel to national
tournaments and before I knew it I was
being whisked around the United States
at the age of 17
all because of a video game totally
living the dream life right this is
higher in headfirst into competitive
super smash brothers melee community a
skiing that I&#39;ve been a part of for
nearly 10 years I&#39;m sure that when I say
competitive gaming you guys are
imagining a room of people hunched over
their laptops sometimes I can look like
that but more often it looks something
like this
because smash brothers melee is such an
old game it requires this big boxy TVs
to be played on our players are so
dedicated that they will actually love
these things onto their flight as
carry-ons sauce resulting in photos like
this the community is also absurdly
diverse this is a photo of apex an
annual tournament held in New Jersey in
2013 over 1500 people showed up from 16
different countries I feel like if 16
countries are flying out in New Jersey
that&#39;s saying something
sorry New Jersey in the gaming community
I was known by didn&#39;t my gamertag
milktea but in real life I was still
very much just Lilian when I was 17 I
was shy and quiet and I was often
bullied by my classmates for being
different for being Asian some of them
made fun of the clothes I wore others
asked me out on dates as a joke
another called me a Chinese prostitute
but when I was milk tea I was part of a
community that welcomed and accepted me
except what&#39;s missing from this picture
do you see any women when the social
when the gender imbalance is this large
social dynamics can become a bit food
you get a lot more attention than you
normally would at the time I didn&#39;t
understand why I was getting this
attention I just knew that it was so
much better than what I was dealing with
at school here&#39;s what my favorites
[Applause]
but then things took a turn for the
worse and then you start to see comments
like this
I felt myself over years I began
internalizing all of this and then I
took these attitudes and projected them
on to other women
you know why is she so girly is she got
a real Beemer I felt my voice shrinking
and the resent growing inside of me
eventually
I distanced myself from the smash
community altogether fast forward a few
years I landed my first job in New York
City there I realized that excess
behavior didn&#39;t have to be the norm but
nevertheless I see quiet and withdrawn
public speaking never going to happen
but then this Facebook comment appeared
in my feed
I swear at that very moment my inner
Wallflower spontaneously combusted I
started writing blog posts that talked
about my experiences and issues I had
feasts within the community and to my
surprise they went viral within our
scene a well-known fighting game website
picked up one of my posts and later on
polygon a gaming site covered my future
work all of this led to the creation of
the new meta a panel that I co-founded
and moderated with the NYU game Center
we roped in tons of women from different
gaming communities to talk about issues
of sexism within gaming but the entire
panel&#39;s point was to raise awareness in
a way that did not shame male gamers as
a woman I was sexist and even
misogynistic attend to my own gender
sometimes when you&#39;ve been immersed in
the environment for long enough it
because it can be hard to differentiate
between harmful behaviors and normal
ones while some gamers are intentionally
malicious some may not even realize that
they&#39;re perpetuating sexist behaviors in
the first place empathizing with these
gamers is more productive and outright
dismissing them initiate a conversation
deconstruct these behaviors no matter
how obvious they might seem to you and
please leave the excuse
very tone behind if I had been dismissed
as a sexist neckbeard I wouldn&#39;t be on
the stage talking to you right now and
to my surprise I found that people are
willing to change and they wanted to
help and whenever I had any doubts I
started to receive feedback like this
this entire experience has shown me that
my silence only further enabled sexism
within gaming nobody is perfect
internalizing biases and becoming lost
in them it&#39;s deceptively easy but by
being vocal you force yourself and those
around you to reevaluate their actions
and their perceptions everyone in this
room has a voice you have to use it and
you have to use it responsibly not only
can you provoke change but you can
empower others to do so - thank you
[Applause]
you
