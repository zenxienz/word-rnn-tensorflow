so Jacqueline grew up here and this
village and I&#39;d like you to share with
all of us here Jacqueline what happened
when you were 14 in this village what
were you facing when I was foot when I
was 14 years old my father decided to
circumcise me then marry me off and that
was the ring that I was totally again is
because I like education although they
massage male don&#39;t like education in
fact the most things which was troubling
me was to undergo sgn because I
experienced my sisters were ahead of me
I saw on my naked eyes the total problem
of Adrian devon degaul svm in fact if I
tell you the truth because I saw on my
naked eye Adele being circumcised effect
a terrible situation in life so I was
not ready for it in thats why i decided
to run away and i go to as sentra a
three-day sender which is being run by
mum Agnes is the eda of what we do and
it that she did send a cold casado when
I went there she accepted me and she
took me back to school and now I&#39;m a
current form for student
[Music]
like Jacqueline didn&#39;t say is that she
ran away in the night after telling her
mother and with nothing except what she
had on and stayed with the neighbor and
then walked for days for a long long way
to come to a place that Agnes runs and
has run for some time the vday susurrus
center for girls and they&#39;re there this
very courageous Masai woman who decided
to challenge the tradition of female
genital mutilation and also start to try
and change the thinking about early
marriage so Agnes tell us about the
thorough and what you did offer
jacqueline as you offer other young
girls seeking this can never escape and
their education thank you my name is
Douglas bother you and I ran away this
is how the dentist does that run away
from female genital mutilation and Ally
marriage and that is why I just leans
ran through and when she come on oh and
other girls camp some of them come tired
hungry because they run away as nice
they don&#39;t want to be seen by the
apparent me that they want to be seen by
the neighbor because they fear that
their father might suggest them on the
way before they arrive to the father so
when this girl arrives we talk to them
we give them food and because we are
other girls living at the sender they
are given comfort by the other girls
when they see them and they get that
courage and you tell them you are in the
right place and the decision you have
made is the right decision then we will
take you to school and you educate them
and you give them security and safety
but you also try and reconcile them with
their families so when Jacqueline
graduated you said to her it&#39;s time to
go home it&#39;s time to reconcile with your
family Jacqueline take me back to that
day tell us the story of returning
through your village seeing your father
again and your family for the first time
in four years
okay at the first time when I had that I
was to go back and bring me consult with
my father it was very hard to me because
I didn&#39;t know if he will accept me the
first thing which can in my mind I was
that my verizon needed killing me
because it was very angry angry in fact
she was happy because you get enough
house enough hajjali when he married me
off but when I went to him in fact she
was very hungry that I think in on that
side if you could have got me the
solution was just killing me or rather
bring something very harmful to me but
it&#39;s jaress what happened anyway right
and we had to you and yeah anyway when
when Agnes tried many times before that
day of reconciliation because he tried
with some village elders to communicate
with my father and after all he accepted
me back in fact they were known for
reconciliation in any way my father and
pressing me I was very happy and proud
of him and we feel very honored to share
this moment of reconciliation and to
welcome your father who has traveled
from his masai village for the first
time ever in his life to join us
