Throughout most of my childhood,
I was on a little league baseball team.
Excuse me.
It may come as a shock to you,
but I wasn&#39;t exactly the star player.
Instead I was more
of a glorified bench-warmer.
I don&#39;t mean to brag --
I&#39;m sorry, my voice
was cracking a little bit.
But when I was 11,
my head coach started to encourage me
to write articles for the local newspaper.
Thrilled, I went out
and bought a tape recorder
so I could take verbal notes
on score changes, player substitutions
and the number of sunflower seeds I ate.
When I got home after my first game,
I was eager to listen to my notes.
But after 10 seconds,
I turned it off, cringing.
I couldn&#39;t understand myself.
If I couldn&#39;t comprehend
or stand the sound of my own voice,
how could others?
Around this time, I also
started to feel like an outcast.
Middle school and most of high school
were very lonesome times for me.
Just like when I was 11,
I couldn&#39;t understand myself,
and not many others could either.
At the end of high school
and throughout college,
I really fit in.
But there was a void

in my confidence still:
a sense that I didn&#39;t quite grasp
how the world saw me,
vis-Ã -vis my disability
and how it affected my life.
My discovery of documentary film making
was not only a discovery
of self-expression
but of a way to intellectually
place myself in my world.
My first documentary,
&quot;Wheelchair Diaries,&quot;
exposed the lack of accessibility
in Western Europe
after I was told
I couldn&#39;t study abroad there.
Now going to Europe with a wheelchair
to show how hard it is
for people who use wheelchairs
is a wacky, counter-intuitive,
dare I say stupid idea.

(Laughter)

Nevertheless, along with my friend
and talented camera-person, Mark,
I traveled throughout Europe
for three weeks, documenting what I faced.
It was one of the most excruciating,
exhausting times of my life.
After 18 months of work on my film,
and with the use of subtitles,
I narrated my tumultuous journey
in 28 minutes.
And when I showed the film to audiences,
I began to realize

that none of it would go in vain:
not the physical toll
those three weeks took on my body,
not the wheelchair that was broken
by the airline in Brussels,
not the experience of being told
I couldn&#39;t study abroad.
None of these would go in vain
because people would experience,
and hopefully be moved by, what I faced.
For another project,
I wanted to bring my journey
of self-discovery to a whole new level
while at the same time bringing it back

to where my formative years took place:
the baseball dugout.
This time, however,
I would hold the camera.
I would narrate my story
without the use of subtitles.

Video: I&#39;m a filmmaker
who can&#39;t shoot a steady shot ...
(Music)
... on the baseball field, can&#39;t play.
(Music)
But it&#39;s worth it for those moments
when I make it onto the field.
(Music)
My seven-minute documentary,
&quot;A Cerebral Game,&quot;
is an award-winning film that has played
coast to coast and internationally.
OK, that time I did mean to brag.

(Laughter)

Thank you.

(Applause)

Maybe I didn&#39;t realize this at the time,
but this film was not
about educating others.
It was once again
about placing myself in my world.
It was about healing old,
adolescent memories.
It was about making sure
my pain would not go in vain.
Other than the systemic discrimination
that people with disabilities
face in the job market,
they are not adequately represented
in the film industry
because of the intense
physical nature of film making.
But the different physicalities
of people with disabilities
are precisely why there needs to be
more of them in the film industry.
People with disabilities should make films
by duct-taping cameraphones
to their wheelchairs.
They should create visuals
in the complete absence of audio
and vice versa for people
who are deaf or blind.
They should impress themselves
and their literal physcality
onto YouTube and Facebook,
festivals and big screens,
yes, so others can more
viscerally grasp what they face.
But perhaps more importantly,
so they themselves can appreciate
their own struggles;
so they can understand themselves, 
loud and clear.
Thank you.

(Applause)
