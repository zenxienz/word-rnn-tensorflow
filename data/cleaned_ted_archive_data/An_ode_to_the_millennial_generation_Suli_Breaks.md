um this is a message for my generation
or actually realistically it&#39;s just a
message from me who&#39;s deluded enough to
believe that he can speak for an entire
generation but I had so many negative
things about my generation the
millennial generation the me me
generation that I hope this peace poem
changes some people&#39;s perceptions they
say I don&#39;t get involved in politics but
I engage in politics on Facebook I don&#39;t
watch the news cuz I get my daily news
reports via Twitter my religion I guess
it&#39;s best called faith because the only
promised land I ever knew starting with
a H wasn&#39;t called heaven it was called
Hollywood the first and only royalty I
ever knowledged
was The Fresh Prince and Queen B the
only place voting has ever made sense to
me is an American Idol the voice and the
x-factor we hash tag everything X
collaborations use abbreviations and
disregard punctuation but so what
because we migrated from the mindset of
we have to - we want to so rather than
know a lot about a little we decided it
was better to know a little about a lot
I guess that&#39;s how we create businesses
online without having to leave our house
and yeah we have apps to order pizza
we keep complaining about this world but
who&#39;s going to change it I mean you keep
criticizing my generation forgetting who
raised it
you either accept us or you reject us
but there&#39;s no way you&#39;re ever going to
deliver that message the way you would
dress us because you keep telling us to
look up from our screens just so we can
see you looking down on us it seems I
mean you expected us to cry when Humpty
Dumpty fell off the wall and was
surprised when we didn&#39;t because they&#39;re
no longer waiting for all of the king&#39;s
horses and all the king&#39;s men to put him
back together again instead we made
scrambled egg whites out of Humpty
Dumpty that evening because apparently
we&#39;re The Lost Generation
so can you blame us for finding
something to do whether it&#39;s twerking on
snapchat or creating Kermit memes that&#39;s
none of your business because the world
is no longer yours we took away the Y&#39;s
and create our own parser now with ours
I said the world is no longer yours we
became the Generation Y before you could
arks it so now it&#39;s ours so whether it&#39;s
cupcake machines kennel computers or
driverless cars we don&#39;t believe in war
or lettuce on World of Warcraft we don&#39;t
have time to care about your race or
sexuality if they don&#39;t make sense we
question the rules because we believe
that rulers are meant to be broken and
maybe we&#39;re still keeping up with the
kardashians because it&#39;s better than
that of a reality TV show that you
called the news can you blame us for
actually wanting to learn something that
we can apply and roll laughs in schools
things like not to step into a red
circle wearing red shoes I mean I grew
up watching the Magic School Bus
how&#39;d you expect me to believe I could
never learn anything inside the
classroom I said I grew up watching the
Magic School Bus
I learnt there&#39;s only so much that you
can learn inside the classroom we are
taken over and here are our demands not
that you finish everything on your plate
or brush before you sleep no it&#39;s simply
that you listen because it&#39;s a new day
and even though we grew up in different
generations we&#39;re facing the same
disguises different situations so
instead of you guys saying I was once
young like you so I know exactly what
you need to do you need to think about
it is that the kind of reasoning a
younger version of yourself would have
responded to because if you allowed
yourself to take a sip from the
our interview for a second you see that
we&#39;re really not that different what if
I replace IBM with Apple encyclopedia
with wiki emails with letters iPads with
legends all the wise men you ever knew
growing up with Google maybe four I
replaced Obama Bill Clinton Messi
Maradona Rihanna with Madonna you&#39;d have
a better understanding of our way of
thinking because you see in this world
there is yin and yang yang there&#39;s
positive and negative every plus there&#39;s
a minus so maybe if you focus more on
our multiple successes we wouldn&#39;t be as
divided it&#39;s my generation the worse yes
probably if I&#39;m honest the he without
sin cast the first stone I mean at least
give us an opportunity to grow did you
know that it takes one billion to 3.3
billion years to create diamonds out of
stones so give us time because you can&#39;t
expect the caterpillar to transform into
a butterfly overnight because this is
the millennial generation manifesto and
this is our only demand listen and learn
to trust us before you judge us slowly
breaks hashtag team millennial thank you
very much
[Applause]
thank you sorry
