tell you
[Applause]
I&#39;m here to speak to you about barbecue
about barbecue and geography barbecue
and tradition barbecue and identity but
it&#39;s going to be a very technical talk
and before I go any further I need to
get some sense of whether or not you
have any expertise in the terms I&#39;m
going to be using the context of this
talk I&#39;m going to flash the terms I&#39;m
going to flash some pictures on the
stage on the screen if you know if they
are just yellow mouth don&#39;t wait for me
to call on you just yell out that well
get some gauge your whether or not you
have much knowledge before begin this
discussion you might know what that is
what about that what about that you&#39;re
ahead of yourself about that all right
what about that
[Music]
I don&#39;t think we have consensus here I
think therefore that should be our point
of beginning this ladies and gentlemen
is a map of the vinegar soft States of
America see what happens is that the
United States as you know started off
with some folks were already here
Vincente people who hadn&#39;t been here
before from Africa and Europe came over
then some other people came over me the
further away and the whole history of
this country has been an attempt to
figure out how to take all these various
people and create one kind of culture
among them you know that latin term a
pluribus unum out of many one that&#39;s
been a big part of what we&#39;ve been
attempting to do in the United States
and our culture in general and also in
terms of our barbecue culture now one of
the problems with this whole conception
is that a few years ago they people did
a poll and they realized that the most
popular condiment in America was salsa
salsa comes from Mexico which raises the
question of why&#39;d that mortar is even
there because the idea of a ward of a
course is you draw the line here
everything inside of this space is the
same everything outside of that space is
different but why is it that the number
one kind of in America comes from what
is arguably another country let&#39;s bring
it a little closer to home in East Texas
they listen to more zydeco than they do
in North Louisiana so why is that border
there in the context of barbecue we&#39;ve
arrived at a kind of national notion of
a barbecue was supposed to be barbecue
is usually ribs it&#39;s usually with a
sweet ketchup B sauce and you go
anywhere in the country and go to any
grocery store anywhere you&#39;ll find this
is what people think barbecue is but
that is not always the case in Texas
well barbecue most importantly we need
to realize there&#39;s some things that are
not a part of this discussion I know
there&#39;s some vegetarians here but tofu
is not barbecue carrots are not barbecue
corn is not barbecue and even though we
got a whole lot of places urban chicken
chicken is not barbecue
what we&#39;re talking about here is meat
beef or pork cook slowly over wood with
more smoke than fire and usually in the
United States they put a little sauce on
it but after having arrived that what
barbecue is will find that it changes
depending on where you are if you know
nothing else about Texas you know the
symbol of Texas is the cow or as they
like to call it the Longhorn and in
Texas barbecue is usually beef brisket
sliced served of course on a bun and
often served with coleslaw the problem
is that if you go to South Texas they
serve something very different they call
it barbacoa and it&#39;s not the brisket at
all it&#39;s actually the meat of the cow&#39;s
head being barbecued underground slowly
they don&#39;t even serve it on a bun they
serve it on a tortilla and they don&#39;t
serve it with regular barbecue sauce
they serve it with salsa that condiment
that is now the number one condiment in
America what about in the zydeco country
part of Texas that is close to Louisiana
border and of course their barbecue is a
lot more like the barbecue that used to
in Louisiana you get pork barbecue ribs
this is a kind of national standard of
what we&#39;ve come to think of as barbecue
now even if Texans can&#39;t make up their
mind about whether or not barbecue is
supposed to be beef whether it&#39;s
supposed to be pork the people in South
Carolina in the Palmetto State they
don&#39;t have any problem with that
barbecue is pork for them no question
about it
and in addition to the fact that it&#39;s so
crucial in South Carolina it&#39;s also
throughout the whole region in the
southeast around all the place that we
refer to a few minutes ago as the
vinegar sauce States of America now
South Carolina claims that they actually
invented barbecue so they got all the
different kind of sauce conceptions
available to them the ones made with
vinegar the ones Mabel to ketchup the
ones made with mustard usually they
serve it on a sandwich of pork of course
this might look a lot like the beef
brisket sandwich we saw a little while
ago in Texas but don&#39;t tell them that
it&#39;s a big rivalry between the
- not supposed to be the same at all but
we found is that these traditions move
with the people so the protect us
barbecue tradition of barbecued cows has
moved through the Midwest and also you
find that people from the southeast
moves in the great black migration to
the cities of Los Angeles and Oakland
and Detroit and Chicago bringing
barbecue to those places and that&#39;s
where we got this national conception it
was so different from what people are
eating at home what happens then is you
have all these big companies saying that
this is what barbecue is supposed to be
what you&#39;d normally assume is that it&#39;s
a David you live kind of battle and all
these little things all these vinegar
sauce states all these mustard sauce
states all of them would go away but
that&#39;s not exactly what happened
in fact the apple as it happens go to
San Francisco these days you can go to a
place called Memphis Minnie&#39;s and you
can get barbecue sauces whoo all these
regions mustard sauces vinegar sauces
ketchup sauces you go to New York once
again a long way away from vinegar sauce
country you got all of these kinds of
traditions happening side by side so we
end up with is not what we thought we
wanted not this notion of a pluribus
unum out of many one it&#39;s more like a
pluribus Flora bus it&#39;s a part of many
many thank you
[Applause]
