as a screenwriter I love telling stories
about people who overcome seemingly
insurmountable obstacles where you&#39;re
wondering how these characters you come
to care about could possibly make it to
the other side there&#39;s a parent the last
thing I want is for my newborn child to
face those kind of impossible odds
that&#39;s where I found myself about five
years ago my son Oliver wasn&#39;t making
eye contact and didn&#39;t seem to notice
any of these very colorful toys that
they make for children so we took him to
the pediatrician and he told us that I
was being a neurotic first-time parent
and you know to relax and just you know
lower my expectations for a
three-month-old well that didn&#39;t seem
very satisfying so we sought out a
second opinion
Google and my wife my wife learned too
there was a suggestion to shine a
flashlight in his eyes and you know if
he blinks then you at least you can rule
out a visual impairment so we walked
into his room and there was in his crib
little baby eyes open so we shined this
flashlight in his eyes but he didn&#39;t
blink
so one pediatrician and then a neuro
pediatric ophthalmologist later we
learned that Oliver was blind now
his condition is called isolated foveal
hyperplasia basically your retina in the
back of the eye is like a target middle
the targets the macula the middle the
macula the bullseye is called the fovea
it&#39;s where 95% of your cones are all of
your light is focused there half of your
brains visual cortex is devoted to its
signals for some reason his didn&#39;t
develop there&#39;s no known cause nor is
Erik your and if anyone out there is
working in the field please look me up
but at the time Oliver and my wife and I
were in darkness the only encouraging
news was it at about a year the rest of
his retina developed and he had
something like 2,400 vision that&#39;s the
blurry one up there blurry chart
basically what a normal person can see
at 400 feet he can see at 20 feet here&#39;s
another picture there&#39;s a toy on the
ground there&#39;s wallpaper there&#39;s a
skateboard there&#39;s all kinds of stuff
that you can&#39;t you just can&#39;t make out
the detail 2400 but it&#39;s just a part of
your everyday life if you have typical
vision now this is a huge problem for
infants because 90% of what they learn
is by what they observe so whether it&#39;s
you know modeling or seeing someone use
a fork watching a sunset reacting to a
smile none of those things could happen
and around 18 months my greater fears
were bearing out
Oliver tested in the bottom 2% for his
age
experts cautioned us to expect him to
need heavy assistance his entire life so
suddenly you stopped thinking you know
what college or preschool even your kids
going to attend and you know when is he
gonna talk walk will I be able to have a
meaningful conversation with him so
sorry but the truth is I write a lot
about advancements in technology into my
fiction so I actually in fact right now
work on a show about brain science and I
knew that early intervention and the
brain is most malleable when in an
infant so there was hope we enrolled him
in a five-day week intensive program we
augmented it with physical therapy
occupational therapy all kinds of
treatments that if you&#39;re fully sighted
you take for granted but he had to learn
individually and then of course we got
him glasses because yeah it helps that
he&#39;s cute but on top of on top of
everything else he was farsighted but
over time these really started to make a
difference so rather than enroll him in
a tip in a special preschool we enrolled
him in the local preschool and the first
year was very hard kids move fast and
they don&#39;t have a lot of patience
identifying friends or even making them
was a chore and people didn&#39;t want to
talk about his visual impairment they
thought it might stigmatize him but our
general approach was we want to do to
embrace his challenge rather than shy
away from it rather than try to hide it
we wanted him to feel comfortable using
that&#39;s what we call a special tool it&#39;s
like a magnifying glass we&#39;re moving to
the front to see better and they&#39;ll let
kids know the reason he didn&#39;t say hi
was not because he was being rude he
just didn&#39;t see that over time this has
made an incredible impact this year he
enrolled in kindergarten completely on
his own he we&#39;ve taken him snowboarding
he&#39;s developed an affinity for math and
music and started to play piano he&#39;s
learned to look at a objects up close
and then form a larger mental image of
the larger space the changes have been
so dramatic that I wanted to share some
of the key takeaways
you know first it&#39;s incredibly upsetting
to me and just mind-boggling how many of
the experts good experts were completely
wrong and very quick to relegate
children like Oliver to this life of
unsettling dependency of the 10 million
legally blind in the net in the United
States nearly 90% have some vision like
Oliver and yet they have a 60 percent
unemployment rate and that&#39;s to say
nothing of their underemployment with
the right tools motivation and early
intervention they can chase their dreams
just like anyone else second when they
do start to succeed it&#39;s important to
take off the training wheels
let them explore discover even struggle
for me I know when I&#39;m in a rush it&#39;s
it&#39;s easy for to want to tie your shoes
for him or build a more protective world
around him because I know the challenges
that he faces and yet it&#39;s important to
find that balance of giving a child&#39;s
enough that they have the assistance
they need but not so much so that they
don&#39;t have to feel that they have to try
or the day can be reliant on others and
then third Oliver story is just
beginning he&#39;s five but it&#39;s quickly
become one of my favorites to tell
everyone of us faces challenges but they
can lead to incredible gifts and life is
about embracing all that makes us who we
are so that we can make the most of our
time here and that&#39;s something he
reminds me of and
day
