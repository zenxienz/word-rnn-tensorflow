that&#39;s my mom and dad Ernie and Maggie
Thompson and they were an interracial
couple that started dating in the 1940s
a little before bill de blasio and his
wife they dated in Harlem which was a
friendly place or you could be an
interracial couple this is a photograph
of Harlem I actually grew up in the
african-american community in Orange New
Jersey which Olivia how much smaller but
what we had in common was the people in
the windows when I was a teenager I used
to think I was sneaking boys in to my
house after school I was definitely not
supposed to do when my odds Eddie was
always looking out the window and she
would call my parents and I got in so
much trouble it was this watching and
this organization and the system that
helps us to grow up to be good people I
became a doctor since Baldwin from
Harlem became a great writer in 1988 I
was doing public health research in San
Francisco and the papers reported that
there was an outbreak of gonorrhea among
african american teenagers and it noted
that this was linked to smoking crack
cocaine I didn&#39;t know anything about
crack cocaine so I sat down with some
people who used the drug and I you know
said so how do you take it like every
four hours and they said
they said no if you have one hundred
fifty dollars you go to the crack house
and you take 150 dollars if you have
thirty thousand dollars in a Mercedes
you go to the crack house and you take
thirty thousand dollars and you give
them the keys and they sit and we buy it
from teenagers i sat down with some
teenagers and some young some young guys
and I said yeah so what&#39;s up and they&#39;re
like that&#39;s our job and if our job and
if crackles the way it&#39;s going to be
another job i&#39;ma sell that and Yale my
cell is to pregnant women because
they&#39;re gonna buy it from somebody else
if I don&#39;t sell it to them nineteen
ninety i moved back to the east coast
and this is what Harlem looked like one
in three buildings had been destroyed
and I heard the same stories of crack
and AIDS and desperation for jobs as a
physician this problem of how is this to
be healed how is it to be controlled
just completely took over my whole body
I went to Paris and I went to a
conference on aids substance abuse and
homelessness tall french guy with his
big gray hair walked to the podium and
he said if you want to heal the problems
of the neighborhood&#39;s you have to fix
the city his name was Michelle can&#39;t
tell Jafar and I asked him to be my
teacher and he has been my teacher ever
since and I was fighting him in France
and in the United States and it&#39;s his
principles of urban alchemy that I&#39;ve
tried to apply and one of them was that
the fracture in the city is between the
rich neighborhoods and the poor
neighborhoods and of course in the
united states between white and black
and that what we had to do was find ways
to make connection in my own
neighborhood where i worked as
washington heights and the first map
with the colors is the 1937 redlining
map and this map was created by race and
class the second map is an aerial
photograph that hung on our office wall
which to me was a challenging new way of
looking at the area because to the top
of the arrow is Washington Heights to
the bottom of the arrow is Harlem in my
head these two places were set
RIT they didn&#39;t connect but on the map
they obviously connected and one of the
places where they connected was where
highbridge Park met jackie robinson park
and this took us exploring in the parks
highbridge park at that time was really
abandoned and we found the most amazing
things in there everybody has seen this
whole water tower but there were huge
bridges with stone arches secret
graffiti made by the homeless people who
live there was an amazing thing urbanus
Marshall Brown said we could make a
trail that would connect parks between
Central Park and all the way up north
through these escarpment parks that hug
the hillside he said our name should be
city life is moving bodies climb and he
made us a logo every year we have a
community potluck party and neighbors
all the organizations in northern
Manhattan bring tables and chairs and
food and entertainment we hiked to the
site and we have a lot of fun and we
always have paper mache giraffes because
if you need to bring a new york city
abandoned forest back to life your most
powerful weapon is false eyelashes it
works we are making a new map and we&#39;re
doing this with the help of designers
that would connect it with us through
design NYC at Haifa Heights nine we
collected information this is our new
map this will be our 10th year and
you&#39;re all invited I brought your
buttons but the problem that we face is
that in this time we have watched Harlem
gentrify and we know that if we don&#39;t
stop the policies the neighborhoods of
New York will continue to be torn apart
when I talk to people about the problems
of poor neighborhoods they say to me
well I feel bad for them that&#39;s like me
thing I&#39;m paralyzed I feel bad for my
legs our nation is paralyzed but it&#39;s
not the poor neighborhoods are not a
separate part we are one nation Michelle
cans house apart told us we could heal
my connection and he is right we can
heal by connection and so I bring you
this message from our hood rock The Love
thank
ah
