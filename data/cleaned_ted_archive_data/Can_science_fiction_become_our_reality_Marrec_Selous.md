behind me is the opening sequence of
1968 s movie 2001 a Space Odyssey in it
there&#39;s things like spaceships and space
stations and even moon bases that&#39;s so
cool I wish we had one of those today
but unfortunately by 2001 all we had was
this the International Space Station
which is puny in comparison and we
hadn&#39;t even returned to the moon since
1972 so I asked myself what happened why
did our space program achieve so little
in the last 45 years when it managed to
achieve so much in the decade after the
war well to answer this question I took
a look at two famous science fiction
writers first of all Isaac Asimov and
also author C Clark so let&#39;s talk a
little bit about arthur c clarke he was
actually the writer for the screenplay
of the movie 2001 a space odyssey and he
believed that in future we would be
spread all over the solar system and we
would have we would be preparing for
interstellar travel but you know the
truth is very different and in fact
someone who had it a lot more right was
Isaac Asimov he happened to be a
professor in biochemistry and he was
really really good at making predictions
at the 1964 World Fair he guessed things
like 3d printing and 3d video video
conferencing artificial meat
self-driving cars and even came close to
guessing the current world population
but I think his most significant
prediction is that he thought that by
2014 we would have landed robots on Mars
which is amazing but it&#39;s a modest
prediction compared to what arthur c
clarke believed would happen so I think
that we&#39;ve stalled in our space program
I think Clarke was wrong
and Asimov was right because our frame
of mind has changed I&#39;d like to talk
about a book who I think it&#39;s
frightening Lee similar to the present
it&#39;s called brave new world and it&#39;s
written by Aldous Huxley and it depicts
a world in the future that&#39;s controlled
by consumerism technology and pleasure
populations are kept in check thanks to
technology sex and drugs as a results
you have people who feel satisfied with
their day to day experiences who don&#39;t
question themselves but also don&#39;t
question the world they live in who have
adopted a narrow frame of mind I&#39;m
worried that this is a future we could
risk running into today I look around
and I see people who spend all their
time on their screens I know some people
in my own generation who spent their
lives on the Internet
I know some of my peers who don&#39;t
actively look for enlightenment anymore
I mean I live in New York City which is
an amazing city with so many
opportunities and I know some people who
never even try and grasp at those
opportunities and I think the result of
this are people who can be very easily
influenced and especially influenced by
misinformation we&#39;ve seen this as
recently as over the past few months
where the Ebola crisis meant that people
have started panicking because instead
of looking for answers by themselves and
going on a personal quest for discovery
they&#39;ve turned to social media for
answers which is never a good idea this
is why I think that arthur c clarke was
wrong and Asimov was right this is why I
think in the years following the Apollo
program we closed in on ourselves it&#39;s
why I think that instead of opening our
perspective and expanding our worldviews
we&#39;ve adopted this narrow frame of mind
I look around and I fear that our
modern-day society is being controlled
more and more by consumerism too
ecology and pleasure I don&#39;t see
ourselves reaching for the stars as much
as we used to
I see ourselves slowly closing in and I
fear that there&#39;ll be one day when we&#39;ll
be too scared to leave our comfort zone
and as a result we&#39;ll miss out on better
things so today I challenge you to learn
from what science fiction has to offer
to turn off the screens and instead of
seeking superficial pleasures seek
understanding and find the bliss that
comes with it thank you
