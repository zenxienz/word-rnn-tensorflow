oh no there we are I think over okay
yeah I think we&#39;re okay your mic isn&#39;t
working okay so you let less you just
you you wowed us with this vision for
creating these modular reactors that can
power cities that&#39;d be safe you could
scale them up they were pretty easy to
deploy you would use off-the-shelf
hardware technology how close are we to
that becoming a reality yeah well I mean
the nice thing about this power reactor
technology fission is it&#39;s it&#39;s not a
physics problem to overcome it&#39;s simply
a how we&#39;re gonna put it together
manufacturing problems so most of
material science has been worked out and
so yeah it&#39;s essentially it depends on
you know human capital and capital
itself and and factors like that but
it&#39;s as fast as we can design and put
them together so five 10 years to market
that&#39;s probably the the range that we&#39;ll
see if it&#39;s five years to market would
be three or four years to an actual
critical prototype of these reactors but
the nice thing about it is not only is
the the technology very simple behind it
and the physics has been solved but it&#39;s
a small class of reactor it&#39;s only you
know say less than a hundred megawatts
and skills all the way down to the
couple of megawatts range for you know
certain remote applications for it
operating bases of department defense
remote communities things like that and
I mean that&#39;s where we&#39;re going in power
generation
anyway this idea behind distributed
generation for a variety of reasons but
yeah what are some one cuz you have but
you now have a company you run a company
and this is what you you aim to do what
are the biggest challenges regulatory
energy safety I mean what are you what
do you face yeah well I mean the from a
regulatory standpoint these reactors are
nice because they have had the potential
to release radioactivity removed so I do
is you still have some kind of nasty
gnarly stuff in the core and that&#39;s why
again eventually I think we&#39;ll see
fusion although we&#39;re a ways away from
that so there&#39;s still gnarly stuff in
there but because you&#39;ve removed the
chemical or the hydraulic potential to
release the radioactivity from a
regulator standpoint you still have to
take account that there&#39;s there&#39;s nasty
stuff
there but a lot of the regulatory
complex he goes away and so does a lot
of the cost I mean the problem with
nuclear power right now is it you know
nine times out of ten when you have a
bad thing happen though the plants
perform well but they perform well in
that kind of narrow operating window and
so nuclear power is very expensive
because you&#39;re essentially building two
or three plants and one when you take in
the backup systems necessary to prevent
you know an accident and the loss of
coolant situation like Fukushima so give
us a sense of where you see our power
landscape a North American power
landscape in 10 20 even 50 years
sure well like I said we&#39;re moving more
towards this distributed generation
model and you know I think that&#39;s
essentially for three reasons I think
when the biggest is efficiency right if
you have big gigawatt scale power
generators and your consumers of it are
far away you&#39;re losing a lot electricity
from resistive heating and in the power
lines and so you&#39;re making more
electricity and they actually have to
use the second is grid reliability so
you look like superstorm sandy took down
the grid in the Northeast and terrorists
attack things things like this can bring
down the grid and then lastly if you
look at renewables they&#39;re very much pro
distributed generation idea that every
house could have a generator and solar
panels now you need with certain
renewables you know solar wind things
like this you need redundant you know
essentially power storage which we don&#39;t
have in quantity right now and if we
couldn&#39;t quantity would be very
expensive but do you the idea that you
have a electric car to parked in your
garage then you can charge with solar
that kind of micro grid solution I think
is where we&#39;re moving to where every
city town or even house has its own
generator but we&#39;re gonna need base load
power on top of that I mean renewables
are great and and in some areas they
make sense than they&#39;re cost-effective
but we&#39;re not there yet and even if we
do reach you know very high efficiency
renewable power we&#39;re still gonna need
the base load power on top of that and
the cleanest way to do it and the
densest way to do it is with nuclear
energy because it is so dense and if we
can make it as safe as living next to a
solar farm then I think we&#39;ve solved a
lot of energy problems just briefly one
last
there&#39;s a personal question yeah you are
18 right now you&#39;re 19 19 yeah and I
know you&#39;re tired of the Boy Wonder joke
but the reality you would be if a lot of
universities were interested in you you
would be a freshman in college now it&#39;s
a party that is like conflicted about
having made the decision not to go to
university and to go right into into
what you want to do for the rest your
life sure exactly I mean that&#39;s that was
my huge decision right because I&#39;m very
social outgoing person and I wanted to
kind of follow my friends and and and
into college but I think I realized
there was a huge opportunity here I had
a lot of people wanting to fund me
support me etc to do what I wanted to do
the technology is needed whether it be
the medical technology the security
technology the energy technology and you
know I can get the social stuff in other
ways right and go to parties on the side
so but yeah I miss that and you know I&#39;m
growing up kind of in I&#39;m missing a
little bit of my childhood but you know
one thing I&#39;ll say and you know we
talked about this on the phone when you
called me and that&#39;s the fact that you
know the science is making your career
out of what you do as a child right it&#39;s
the whole exploration right for me
science and it is base with our new
business or engineering or whatever else
science is my passion because for me
it&#39;s like climbing a mountain that&#39;s
exploring the unknown right and that&#39;s
what we do as kids and as a scientist
you know I never have to grow up right I
can constantly feed that that creativity
and an exploration and I hope to do that
and maybe I can solve some big problems
you know along the way well Taylor
you&#39;re awesome for all our sakes I wish
you great great luck thank you so much
