thank you fancy huh it is said most
women dream about their wedding day well
I have to admit when I was five it was
my dream to I wore my mom&#39;s wedding gown
high heels
put on a red lipstick and tell everyone
now I&#39;m a bride
and then over the years like most people
I spent years running away from it why
in my country
weddings are tall extravaganza it&#39;s
about how much money you spend on the
venue the flowers the dress and of
course the ring but I guess it&#39;s not
only my country it&#39;s everywhere in
Singapore I heard that new couples get
cash for a better future in u.s.
you get cheque in Turkey you get gold
coins but for a better future
in fact what do you need a couple of
months ago my husband Charlie and I got
married we said if you don&#39;t want this
kind of crazy spending and nonsense
activities we want to have a fun party
with friends and family and let&#39;s donate
the gold coins to a charity
we met with Corinne G Foundation it&#39;s a
nonprofit that takes care of the orphan
kids providing them a real home and the
real second mom maybe because we decided
to make our family grow we want to start
by doing something good
we said this hundred and thirty eight
kids there are our kids so we will
donate these gold coins to Corinne Jake
foundation for their better future but
who worried to ray gift our guests gift
and if we say we will donate these gold
coins will they still gift us and then
we decided let&#39;s forget about the gold
coins how about selling tickets the next
day
as you can imagine if you had to the
biggest ticket sale company of Turkey
for health
they clearly mentioned as a rule it
should be open to the public vetting
normally involves you know close friends
and families are very open to the public
everything not for us but for everybody
let&#39;s dream all the women are bright all
the men are grew and it&#39;s foster kids
these are our kids and we did it by
donating 100 Turkish lira which is
around $35 you can be a bride or a groom
in our wedding you can wear any dress or
any wedding gown you dreamed of or you
can design it or pick up the dress you
were 20 years ago I created a Facebook
event page and send an email to all of
our friends announcing our wedding date
as you can imagine they loved it loud at
first and then they started purchasing
tickets I guess that was the point we
start to lose control over our own
wedding in less than a week we were on
the news one of the most popular Turkish
columnist share the whole page interview
on a Saturday paper headline wedding
invitation for sale
Turkish people from all around the world
Paris vickysd and Turkmenistan America
UK New Zealand Austria you name it
people start to purchasing tickets who
are these people are they coming to the
party or just making a donation we had
no idea but the Mord media paid
attention the more with the more tickets
we sold and we loved it and on the
morning of the wedding I still remember
it was a sunny beautiful morning in
Istanbul but the news were about
something else
bombings in Ankara targeted the peace
walk 102 people died
if that wok had been in Istanbul most
probably Charlie and I would be there we
were so sad by the lost ones and their
families we canceled the wedding in the
following days there were other bombings
happening all around the country and
then national elections in a state of
tension we met with these three
beautiful beautiful university students
they were looking for a term project I
said how about making a website where
you can donate not only the weddings but
also birthdays or any other events they
loved it but their teacher not didn&#39;t
accept it as a term project so they
volunteered to start it and one of the
entrepreneur organizations in Turkey
picked it up and then they decided they
will do their global entrepreneurship
organizations closing party in our
wedding and the wedding is on and we did
it around hundred people joined the
vetting with the beautiful beautiful
dresses most of them we didn&#39;t know but
we met it tonight and we danced all
night what a great party ten times
people donate it you haven&#39;t met with
them yet but we are so thankful for
their generosity and our kids send us
the best wedding gift ever an image of
them playing in a warm home with big
windows so as I have the beautiful
wedding dress on I&#39;m challenging you in
fact I&#39;m challenging all of you dream to
make a difference even though it&#39;s a
small wedding dream to make a difference
yeah things might get out of hands so be
it
just believe in the best in the people
they will be there for you thank you
