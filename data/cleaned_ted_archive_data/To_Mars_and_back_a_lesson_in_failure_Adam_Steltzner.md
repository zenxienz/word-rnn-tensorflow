this is Mars this is my favorite video
of the surface of Mars actually the only
video of surface of Mars taken by the
Marti imager strapped to the world&#39;s
largest extra s triol rover hanging
underneath the largest supersonic
parachute ever built two and a half
miles above the Mont skies of Mars
it was my luck to lead the team that
developed the landing system to put
curiosity on the surface of Mars and I
want to share with you today about how
much we got wrong on the way to finding
out what was right and how I encourage
you never to let the fact you might be
wrong get in the way of you trying to
find out what&#39;s right now to get to the
surface of Mars you have to do four
things you hit the atmosphere going
about 10,000 miles an hour that slows
you down to about a thousand miles an
hour as you burn a hole through the sky
on Mars then you have to open up a
parachute that gives you a neck snapping
12 G&#39;s and slows you down further but
not slow enough you end up having to use
rockets these Rockets if they&#39;re fancy
rockets with throttles velv slow your
landing down to maybe one or two miles
an hour but maybe as fast as 10 miles an
hour all times we&#39;ve ever gone to Mars
we&#39;ve done these four things here the
Rovers we&#39;ve put on the surface of Mars
starting in 1997 with a little tiny
Sojourner Rover about the size of a
microwave oven followed on by 2004 with
Spirit and Opportunity twin rovers about
the size of a coffee table in 2012
we put down the Big Kahuna
curiosity 900 kilograms bigger than a
car landing her especially that final
touchdown part was really hard we tried
everything we started with airbags to
cushion the final blow we&#39;d used that
for the little rover Sojourner and the
twin Spirit and Opportunity but at 900
kilos there are no fibers known to
humankind strong enough for us to make a
fabric that the bags would work so that
was out we thought about using a leg of
lander you know boom boom land on it
land on it and just drive the rover off
but one of our legged Landers failed and
as we were looking at that failure
learning from our mistakes we concluded
that putting a 900 kilo Rover on a leg
and Lander way too tippy so that was out
we tried to solve the tip eNOS by adding
more legs to the lander and splaying him
out letting the lander do a belly flop
on Mars
unfortunately the fuel tanks with fuel
that&#39;s toxic and explosive sit down on
in the belly of the beast and exploding
on touchdown considered very for poor
form so we armored up the belly of the
beast and it got so heavy
we couldn&#39;t launch it off of Earth three
times we got it wrong until finally we
came together looked at all of the
things we&#39;d gotten wrong and and asked
can we put it together to find something
right and this is a solution we came up
with we called it the sky crane problem
is we couldn&#39;t test it here on earth we
had just one test an expensive test on
Mars the team had to gather together we
had to see if what we had done was
really right
I&#39;m gonna monitor
vehicle reports that traitor face at
this time to get pressurizing the ocean
system to increase the thrust of the
system
Oh use that for all the maneuvering the
atmosphere we&#39;re about to do vehicles
just recorded via tones that it has
started guided entry deceleration tax
parachute deploy your rock
the pressure foot we are accelerating
detail steps has separated women on the
ground man we&#39;re down to 90 meters per
second at an altitude of 6.5 markers
setting standing by for backshell
separation
we are in powered flight
for an altitude of 1 kilometer
descending
dating back respecting that greatest
artists
Finkle know if you remain strong
touchdown Pittsburgh
[Music]
we got a right but it took us a long
time and it took us getting it wrong
several times before we figured out what
to do that worked and I want to
encourage you to always keep that
positive spirit never worry if you get
it wrong because you have to travel
along a road or wrong to find your way
to right
[Applause]
