I have the coolest job in the world I am
a space archaeologist I used satellite
images to find ancient sites which I
then go out and survey on the ground
I&#39;ve been working for the last 20 years
mainly in Egypt but also across the
Mediterranean North Africa and even
Europe I want to tell you a little
secret about we archaeologists we are
time machines we can take you back in
time 100,000 years to the dawn of
humanity and across space to ancient
Egypt the Maya and the Inca but we can
also take you to the future we use data
from our excavations to answer big
questions about ancient human
environment interactions trade and
warfare and we use that data to answer
big questions about what&#39;s happening
today and what may happen tomorrow but
here&#39;s the thing we have barely
scratched the surface in terms of what
we know about the past I think that
there are millions of undiscovered
archaeological sites around the world
and the only way that we&#39;re going to
find them is by using satellites and as
yet undeveloped technologies that you
all will help invent but you&#39;re not even
going to have to be an archaeologist the
most incredible innovations in
archaeology are happening today because
of inventions in areas like DNA mapping
chemical testing and 3d laser scanning
now the future of archaeology is science
these technologies weren&#39;t even around
20 years ago in fact in the 1990s when I
was in high school the highest
resolution satellites had a resolution
of 45 meters per pixel this means that
from space when you zoom in you couldn&#39;t
see things smaller than large buildings
but today things have changed and I just
want to show you an image of the Sphinx
at
Iza in the mid-1990s you really can&#39;t
see anything today satellites have a
resolution of 10 inches per pixel this
means that you can zoom in from 400
miles in space
and see things as small as your laptop
and look at the Sphinx now it&#39;s just
extraordinary so I want to take you
today to the ancient site of Portus just
outside rome outside Rome&#39;s Fiumicino
Airport this was Rome&#39;s major center for
trade and commerce all the goods would
come here from across Rome&#39;s rich empire
here it is it in a sense it was Rome&#39;s
amazon.com I collaborated with
colleagues from Southampton University
in the UK who&#39;ve been working at port us
for over thirty years but they had never
before used satellite imagery so here&#39;s
an image of a reporter&#39;s port now the
problem of Portus worked located is that
look at this landscape it&#39;s incredibly
complex you know you&#39;ve got modern
houses urbanization lots of fields it&#39;s
a really difficult place to work
completely unlike Egypt so we got
satellite data began to process it and
for weeks and weeks in my lab I found
nothing at one point you know I thought
I&#39;d found all these really cool new
houses and warehouses and showed them to
the team at Southampton and they said
they knew about them already I felt like
a complete failure but this is science
we pick ourselves up again and keep
going and we got new data from the site
and in the fields to the northeast of
the main site of Portus when we were
processing the data something really
interesting showed up this feature about
40 meters across with 8 meter thick
walls gates to the east and west cleared
roadways and structures to the north
this is so clear I thought it had to be
modern and when I showed it to the team
at Southampton they were just blown away
they said we think you found the missing
amphitheatre of Portus here&#39;s an example
of one from North Africa amphitheaters
were places of performance places were
plays political debates and battle
reenactments took place in other words
ideas were spreading
circle 180 so here&#39;s another cool
project that I&#39;ve just gotten involved
with taking place at the world-famous
archaeological site of Petra in Jordan
Petra was home to the Nabataeans an
incredible civilization that lived there
2,000 years ago
and it&#39;s amazing that they were able to
have their civilization in this desert
that gets less than six inches of water
per year
the Nabataeans were geniuses at water
man Water Management collecting millions
of gallons of water per year and
cisterns that allowed them to have
incredible trade amass great wealth and
build tombs like this seen in Indiana
Jones so my colleagues asked me to
participate in a project looking at
satellite imagery from this site I said
impossible archaeologists have been
working at Petra for 200 years how is it
that I&#39;m ever going to be able to find
something new but when processing the
data using complex algorithms this
really interesting feature showed up
about 320 meters by 120 meters in size I
collaborated with my colleague dr. Chris
Tuttle and a team of Jordanians they
went out on the ground to check it out
and they found a massive monumental
platform they then brought it a drone
and found this this amazing platform
with internal walls clear rooms and
other structures this could be the site
of an ancient temple and what&#39;s
incredible is that this structure is
only located a kilometer south of the
main city and previous archaeologists
had missed it
zoom in a little bit closer you can see
just how clear this is we&#39;re going to
excavate this feature in future but it
goes to show us just how much there is
left to find at well-known sites and how
ancient cultures like the Nabataeans
thrived in incredibly difficult
environments and also how resilient and
creative human beings can be in the face
of extreme environmental challenges
every week in my lab my team and I are
challenged by trying to find new
archaeological sites and places all over
the world where I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
going to find anything and guess what
I&#39;m nearly always wrong everywhere we
look we find new settlements new temples
and even potential pyramids showing us
that we need to reassess and reanalyze
almost every archaeological site in the
world but here is the most exciting
thing
of all with all the new advances in
satellite technologies and all of the
new technologies that you all will help
to invent by 2035 what will you all find
that we&#39;ve missed thank you very much
