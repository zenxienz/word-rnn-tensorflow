how&#39;s everybody doing how&#39;s everybody
doing alright thank you for having me
I&#39;m going to talk about the in word how
many people have heard that before it&#39;s
a very very powerful word it&#39;s one that
I don&#39;t use I&#39;ve used it in the past but
it it has a lot of a lot of negative and
dark dark history about it when I when I
was told to talk about this about two
weeks ago I wasn&#39;t sure that I could do
it I wouldn&#39;t show that I was equipped
to talk about it well I don&#39;t know who
is who is equipped to talk about this
topic but I meant our kids I&#39;m into kids
your age do my program cause son of a
saint and my kids what my responsibility
is is to make sure that they&#39;re good
ambassadors for the next generation now
I want to tell you all livid about the
history of the word so for 300 years
African men African women African
children were enslaved they were beaten
women were raped and so were kids
fast-forward segregation men were beaten
women were raped and so were kids
nowadays the struggle has changed but
the word is still the same when I was in
seventh grade I was about maybe some of
your ages about three white kids would
always call me dan word so I got in
three fights then I got expelled back
then what you did if somebody called you
that was you fought and I want to tell
you that
the message that the word brings is very
very negative Mark Twain wrote a book
wrote a book Huckleberry Finn and the
book has actually lost popularity over
the last three years because teachers
don&#39;t want to use the n-word in a class
the n-word is in the book well what they
want to do is rerelease it and what they
want to do is substitute the word slave
for the word nigger and that&#39;s what the
word means
the word means slave so think about it
if you use the word if you use it in
love or you you mean it to show
brotherhood or sisterhood towards
another person as some people try to
make the excuse or if you use it in a
negative way substitute it for slave and
see how that goes in rap music Kanye
West&#39;s shock value a lot of rappers use
it I think a lot of rappers are talented
Lil Wayne&#39;s talented Kanye West&#39;s
talented Drake is talented but they
still use the word they still use their
language you think they&#39;re gonna call
that child that that that word
their daughter and their son I don&#39;t
think so they&#39;re doing it to get a rise
they&#39;re doing it for the dollars at the
end of the day the a lot of excuses that
people use are that we own it and I want
you to think of two different things one
what if one of the slave men that were
being whupped grabbed the strap and he
held it up and he said oh I own it it&#39;s
mine and all he did was turn it on his
brothers sister it&#39;s the same thing the
wounds aren&#39;t visible but it means the
same a lot of people a lot of black sale
we own it in this ours just like that
whoop
I also want to say about people people
talk about let&#39;s say if you have to
let&#39;s say your favorite rap song alright
and let&#39;s say there&#39;s two mentions in a
song about the word nigger if you listen
to that word five times a day five days
a week for two three months what happens
is that words get stuck in your head
and it sounds like this nigger nigger
nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger
nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger
nigger
you keep saying that you start to think
you are
Yukie you think that you start to say it
that y&#39;all age all this y&#39;all have
sponges right now and everything that&#39;s
being said to y&#39;all y&#39;all retain y&#39;all
of the future y&#39;all very very bright
y&#39;all need to be leaders don&#39;t follow
other kids if other people use it in
playing games that&#39;s not what the word
is for I want to bury the word don&#39;t
want you all to help me there&#39;s been a
lot of people who have died for the
rights that we have every single day
Martin Luther King and a lot of people
who go on name a lot of people were hung
a lot of people beaten and the last word
they heard was nigger the very last word
and a lot of people use it like it&#39;s
nothing every day language we should be
embarrassed
every time the word is used we
disrespect ancestors and we also
disrespect ourselves so I&#39;m asking you
all I&#39;m charging you all to be leaders
to not use the word to spread this
message can we do that
[Applause]
