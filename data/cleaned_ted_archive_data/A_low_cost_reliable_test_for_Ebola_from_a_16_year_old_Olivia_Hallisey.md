when I was a sophomore in high school in
16 years old I created the Ebola assay
card which is a temperature independent
portable rapid and visual test for Ebola
for which I won the grand prize at the
2015 google science fair and this video
is showing how it&#39;s working the
healthcare worker would put the serum
sample on the first load spot and then
water on the other load spots chemicals
are released and if the person is in
fact positive for Ebola there will be a
blue color change as shown here followed
by a yellow color change confirming that
result the load slots are shaped so
weirdly so that it has no language
barriers and it&#39;s a totally universally
comprehensive process thank you so you
might be thinking why did I do this I
actually took a science research course
at my high school and I didn&#39;t really
know what I wanted to do so at the
advice in my teacher I looked in the
news and kind of going back to the other
talk we heard but I was just really
drawn to the media hysteria and fear
surrounding the Ebola outbreak and
instead of looking at it from this lens
of fear I wanted to look at it from a
perspective that allowed me to see a
solution so a little bit of background
on the 2014 outbreak is that it was 40
times larger than any previous outbreak
with over 11,000 killed as a result and
while these numbers are shocking they
don&#39;t begin to really reflect the ripple
effects a result as result because of
them such as a socio-economic fabric of
these areas being destroyed and now
we&#39;re really seeing emergence of a lost
general lost generation of people who
are at risk for exploitation and
marginalization so what I really wanted
to do looking at this and thinking I
need a project I wanted to find a way to
limit these effects and the best way to
do that is through a symptomatic
diagnostic tools this means tools that
are able to diagnose someone before
they&#39;re showing symptoms and before they
are contagious so if you&#39;re able to
isolate them not only are you able to
break the cycle of transmission
and we are also able to increase their
likelihood of survival so I began
looking at what our current asymptomatic
diagnostic tools and why aren&#39;t they
slowing the exponential growth of this
outbreak seems to be exhibiting and
that&#39;s when I found the Eliza kick and
Eliza kid is an accurate and preferred
method of currently diagnosing Ebola it
works as this graphic shows by having a
piling of chemicals known as reagents in
the presence of a sample and if that
person does have Ebola it will change
color and while it&#39;s very accurate
there&#39;s a series of limitations that
really prevent it from being used on the
mass scale that we need it&#39;s not
portable in these electricity to be read
and it needs a lab setting and it needs
trained medical personnel as well also
it&#39;s very expensive costing around a
thousand dollars and the biggest barrier
I saw was its temperature dependency
meaning it needs an unbroken chain of
refrigeration from point a manufacturer
to point of administration so looking at
this barrier first I just wanted to make
an Eliza kit temperature independent in
that and that&#39;s when I actually found a
TED talk done by Professor feel minetto
on the silk fibroid and silk fibroin is
basically just the protein from a silk
cocoon as shown here and it has a ton of
properties but one of them is that when
you mix a protein with it it is able to
stabilize it and make it chemist
chemically stabilized so that&#39;s the
refrigeration that I needed so I applied
this silk fibroin to the traditional
proof protocol of the Eliza k and I was
able to make the illogic temperature
independent but through doing this I saw
that the well played format of the Eliza
kit is really another huge constraint of
the current path so what I wanted to do
was take this manual piling of reagents
and instead put it on a new format as a
lateral flow system so I began designing
lateral flow test here&#39;s just an initial
prototype with dyes and then I actually
went on the computer and started
designing it with the exact dimensions
and this is my final prototype with the
dies on the low-dose spot low spots and
that&#39;s actually where the silk film is
so in summary as compared to the Eliza
test my test is five dollars compared to
be a thousand dollars of the Eliza test
it takes 30 minutes compared to the two
hours of the Eliza test it&#39;s portable
and more sustainable using just filter
paper photo paper exact amounts of
reagents and a little bit of water as
compared to the plastics and wasteful
reagents it is also temperature
independent needing no refrigeration and
it&#39;s a totally Universal process so that
it can be centralized testing location
and also be administered within an area
by people in that area and you don&#39;t
necessarily have to be a trained medical
person in them as I continue my research
I&#39;m currently developing a salivary
based test for lyme disease because if
you&#39;re able to have it be a saliva based
test then it can not only be a home test
but it also limits the risk to the
health care worker significantly and
because this is based on the Eliza
chemistry theoretically it can be
applied to any disease for which there&#39;s
an Eliza kit including celiac disease
Zika and certain cancer markers as I
have gone through this process I&#39;ve
really seen the importance of
asymptomatic tools in order to
decentralize testing locations and
really slow the growth of outbreaks like
the 2014 Ebola outbreak and the Zika
outbreak and outbreaks that are in the
future and this contributes to the
larger global goals which are healthcare
access and healthcare equity and enable
for us in a order for us to achieve
these goals we really have to not only
accept the benefits that come with
globalization and interconnectedness but
also assume the responsibilities and
realize that whether we believe it or
not we all have the capacity to be the
capacity to be catalysts for change and
I think this is really underscored by a
quote by President Obama which is change
will not come if we wait for some other
person are some
time we are the ones we&#39;ve been waiting
for we are the change that we seek
