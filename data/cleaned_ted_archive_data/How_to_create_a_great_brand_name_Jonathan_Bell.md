there are an estimated 300 million
companies in the world today that&#39;s 300
million brands some brands as big as
Apple and coca-cola others are smaller
than one person business with so many
brands in the world it&#39;s getting harder
to create and find a unique name so how
do you create a great brand name
how can you play and win the name game
you start with three steps first select
what type of name you want there are
seven different categories of names and
pretty much every brand in the world
falls within one of these seven
categories eponymous names like Disney
and Burberry work by embodying the
vision and beliefs of their founders
these names are okay if you&#39;re feeling
lazy or just have a big ego adidas is
more unique it&#39;s derived from Adi
Dassler the company&#39;s founder and Tesla
wasn&#39;t created by Nikola Tesla he died
in 1943 but the name is an homage to
Tesla&#39;s electrical engineering
achievements descriptive names like
American Airlines and the Home Depot
work by telling you exactly what the
company does but these names can be a
mouthful and are much harder to own and
protect acronyms like GE and BP are just
shorthand versions of descriptive names
some acronyms are more strategic
Kentucky Fried Chicken switch to KFC
because Fried Chicken didn&#39;t sound too
healthy and the Hong Kong and Shanghai
bank changed to eight that chose to hate
HSBC to help the bank expand globally
real words like uber and slack a rip
right out of a dictionary and suggest
attributes or benefits uber literally
means an outstanding example so it works
well for a company with big broad bold
ambitions beyond ride hailing now real
words might seem like good ideas but in
a world of 300 million companies it&#39;s
getting harder to find a name how&#39;d it
hard it&#39;s hard to find any real words
left in the dictionary composite names
like Facebook and ray-ban are created by
gluing two words together these names
have a kind of one-two punch and can be
really memorable because it&#39;s so hard to
find real words companies like Kleenex
and Pinterest of invented names by
changing adding or removing letters for
impact
now inventing names can be highly unique
but if you&#39;re not careful they can start
to sound like pharmaceutical drugs or
worse the name of a sofa from Ikea
associative names work by reflecting
imagery meaning back to there back to
the brand the Amazon in South America is
the world&#39;s largest river
therefore the earth&#39;s biggest selection
of books clothes content and so on
Sirius is the brightest star therefore
the radio channels where you can hear
the brightest stars of music and
entertainment and Red Bull Associates -
a drink with bull light qualities such
as power and confidence some brands are
derived from non-english languages like
Samsung which means three stars in
Korean Lego means play well in Danish
Zappos comes from the Spanish word
sapatos for shoes and Hulu comes I bet
you didn&#39;t know that Hulu actually comes
from a Chinese proverb a Hulu is a ball
used to store precious things finally
the seventh type is a tabbed abstract
names names like Rolex and encoder
these names have no intrinsic meaning
but instead rely on the power of
phonetics to create really powerful
brand names okay so once you&#39;ve decided
what type of name you want you need to
decide what you want the name to say and
look of course it&#39;s tempting to create
names that talk about who created them
or what you do or where you operate but
the best brand names don&#39;t don&#39;t
describe they stand for a big idea ones
that translates into emotional appeal
Nike is about winning GoPros about
heroism Apple is about simplicity and
usability and Google comes from the math
term that&#39;s a one with a hundred zeros
after it
so that really big number helps support
the company&#39;s really big original vision
to organize the world&#39;s information so
as you think about your new brand think
carefully and ask yourself what&#39;s your
big idea the third step is to check the
name isn&#39;t already taken you might have
to create hundreds of names perhaps
thousands before you find one that&#39;s
even available and of course don&#39;t
forget to check the name means doesn&#39;t
mean anything negative in other
languages or countries the last thing
you want is an embarrassing naming fail
like this brand of toilet paper from
Sweden
finally a few words about alphabet the
parent company of Google are now one of
the world&#39;s most valuable companies much
has been said and written about the
business strategy but I&#39;ll say a few
words about the name is alphabet a great
name
you bet first of all the name is an idea
as we all know an alphabet is a set of
letters that forms the basis of all
language and communication second the
name provides a playful link back to the
companies underneath G for Google C for
calico and finessed X and so on
third the name encourages Wall Street
investors buy this stock and you&#39;re
making an alpha bet one that will
outperform others and last of all the
name is a real dictionary word which is
a rare find these days now there was
only one issue with alphabet car company
BMW owned the URL alphabet com but you
know here&#39;s the thing
only the dot-com doesn&#39;t matter as much
these days now that we find stuff
through Google search and we connect
with brands through social media and
smartphone apps so alphabet the company
forgot about alphabet calm and instead
found a shorter and more unique web
address ABC dot XYZ thank you
Thank You Jonathan
