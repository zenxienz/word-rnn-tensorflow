what was the universe like shortly after
the Big Bang we think of a hot furnace
temperature is so high that all of
matter was in the form of plasma photons
protons and electrons were all together
in this cosmic soup photons and
electrons were interacting so that the
universe was opaque for much the same
reason that you can&#39;t see through the
Sun but that cosmic soup isn&#39;t just
sitting around idly tiny variations in
the density of the universe eventually
will grow to be all the structures we
see around us those variations in
density also set up cosmic sound waves
as gravity compresses the photon gas and
radiation pressure resists that these
acoustic waves ring in the birth of the
universe as the universe ages it also
cools and once the universe is cold
enough so the protons and electrons can
combine to form mutual atoms the light
can travel towards us unimpeded the
universe becomes transparent as it
leaves the last scattering surface it&#39;s
quite a mouthful which is the last place
that photons and electrons interacted in
this cosmic soup now just as we map the
earth like this universe awareness earth
ball onto a sphere and then look at it
on a map we do the same thing we map the
temperature fluctuations in the radio in
the radiation onto an imaginary sphere
outside of the earth and then we unfold
that into a map so those are the kinds
of images that you&#39;ll see and so these
tiny fluctuations in fact encode what
the universe was like at early times we
can&#39;t actually see the density in the
universe at early times but the
radiation has an imprint of those
conditions places that were a little bit
more dense or act like a sink for the
radiation and they appear a little bit
colder places that were less dense
appear a little bit hotter so what does
the temperature of this radiation look
like this cosmic microwave background
radiation well
this is what it looks like what&#39;s really
surprising is that the universe at early
times was incredibly smooth if you
ignore the galaxies in the middle then
each of those points is different from
the average which is green by one part
one part in a hundred thousand that&#39;s
less than one thousandth of a percent or
like one drop of water in a gallon
amazingly we have to increase the
contrast so take away the average and
increase the contrast by zooming in and
now we see the tiny variations in
density and these variations will grow
to be what we see today
so this beach ball is those variations
on the sky now for decades scientists
have been investigating and looking at
the temperature and polarization of this
radiation and experiments such as the
Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe
another mouthful which made this map and
have been measuring is radiation from
space and in fact in a few short weeks
we&#39;re going to hear from the next
generation plants at alights a European
one called Planck which has been
measuring the radiation from space for
three years
so what happens to these density
fluctuations well they grow under
gravity so areas that were empty become
more empty and dense areas as you can
see in the blue are cooler temperature
plots they get more and more dense and
grow to be stars galaxies and structures
that we see today what if we zoom in
just a little bit more and increase our
angular resolution so I work with a
telescope called the Atacama cosmology
telescope which is based high in the
deserts of northern Chile and measured
this radiation with unprecedented
accuracy soon we&#39;ll be measuring the
polarization as well as the temperature
as a cosmologists I have the privilege
of trying to understand what the
universe was like in the beginning how
it changes with time and I get to map
the incredible journey it has taken to
get us here
thank you
