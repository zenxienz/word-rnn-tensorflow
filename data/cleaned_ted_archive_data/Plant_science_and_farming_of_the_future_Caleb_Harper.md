you got to follow a robot come on
alright so they always put me right
before lunch because I&#39;m going to talk
about food so if you do a simple google
search on food crisis right now you know
you get this kind of overwhelming we&#39;re
talking about climate change we&#39;re
talking about 9 billion people by 2050
we&#39;re talking about GMOs being really
good in some places GMOs being horrible
in other places not enough water it&#39;s
overwhelming it is it takes the human
out of it it takes the person out of it
so when I look at this problem my work I
say ok what&#39;s the derivative got all
these problems I think the derivative is
there&#39;s not enough people to solve them
so right now in the United States about
2% of the population is involved in food
production what kind of answer could you
get from 2% of this room trying to solve
a problem so what we need is more
farmers farmers will not look like this
in the future ok don&#39;t worry
farmers are going to look a heck of a
lot more like this right they&#39;re going
to have specialized knowledge they&#39;re
going to know about electrical
engineering mechanical engineering plant
science data science and in fact space
farmers exist already this is on mears
on Speight international space station
right now
so let&#39;s let&#39;s land some of space on
this stage so this is our food computer
you might ask what does a food computer
do inside of this portion of the box we
create an actuate climate there&#39;s a
designer climate in here things like co2
Oh to temperature humidity all of it
being controlled by your smartphone by a
web app whatever you want when you plant
a plant data starts tracking to that
plant ok so it creates a recipe this is
kind of the brain side and then when you
go in to harvest a plant you&#39;re going to
get that recipe back so imagine a
wikipedia full of climate recipes where
you&#39;re like oh you&#39;re basil was really
good I want to grow your basil download
download actuate grow basil so let&#39;s
start taking this thing apart really
important first component the case right
think of your iPhone case this will
eventually get totally personalized
you&#39;ll express yourself on it whatever
it is that you
want to do but really important is
what&#39;s going on in the climate chamber
so let&#39;s talk about these guys these
plants were actually grown in the food
computer and what you&#39;ll notice is right
so they actually have roots this is a
real plant that you can eat in fact I
can just pick a pepper off of this from
my lab check it out it&#39;s a hot it&#39;s a
hot pepper it&#39;s really hot um but you
know no dirt all the minerals that you
need inside of this water base but
you&#39;re like how do the minerals get
inside of the water aren&#39;t minerals in
dirt
turns out some dirt has minerals some
dirt has things you don&#39;t want to eat
I&#39;m sure you could imagine some places
where you don&#39;t want to eat the dirt so
check this out
little set of peristaltic pumps inside
of these peristaltic pumps
macronutrients nitrogen phosphorus
potassium calcium magnesium boron trace
elements pH balance and acid right
because the water is too basic for the
plants and a little yeast reactor I said
a reactor that&#39;s right you use water and
yeast and sugar and you create co2 did
you know that it smells like bread it&#39;s
amazing so what about this crazy light
you know when you build things you don&#39;t
always build them to take them apart so
right why is my face look like this
this is photosynthetically active
radiation radiation and reactors and
food I know it&#39;s going to take a little
getting used to but this is the part of
light that grows new plants when plants
see light they green because they
reflect it to you they&#39;re only absorbing
between red blue and infra red next on
the list don&#39;t forget your safety
goggles and your pipettes because you&#39;re
going to need them and then of course
what food computer would be complete
without a motherboard so let&#39;s pull the
motherboard out
now imagine if I can get it there goes
you I&#39;ve now taken out the brain okay
this farm has a brain but it&#39;s a brain
that you know right Raspberry Pi how
many of you have programmed that arduino
with shields how many of you played with
those sensors that are attached that you
can get on amazon for not very much
money and of course the box that&#39;s a
crazy mess of wires which is exactly
what it is all right so I&#39;ll go back and
then you just have the chassis so you&#39;re
like that&#39;s a super cool robot but like
you only have one and I don&#39;t have one
wrong we&#39;ve open-sourced all of this
open-source hardware software and data
you can now go to our website pull down
all the parts and build your own food
computer so this is the future far right
this student in a high school and I
think 11th grade that&#39;s a space farmer
right space farmers exist in your
schools and they will in the future so
what&#39;s the point if we have a food
computer that&#39;s cool and all but it&#39;s
like another 3d printer imagine the
world connected by strings that&#39;s what
we have right now with our food we ship
it really far now imagine food computers
coming online sending data sending one
basil from the United States over to
Africa having them actuate and change
one thing that derivative lis going
forward and teaching each other how to
farm so this is not just my fantasy
world we&#39;ve already started doing it so
these are places around the world that
we&#39;ve sent food computers of different
sizes little ones big ones warehouse
sized ones and people are now shipping
data so if you thought you missed
Facebook if you think you missed being
the founder of Google the internet of
food is the thing that you can build you
have the power these are the tools this
looks just like the 70s when they had
weird personal computers right like
you&#39;ve seen the pictures this is the
weird computer the internet of food is
being planted right now start hacking it
thank you
[Applause]
