thank you I&#39;m delighted to be here and
I&#39;m delighted that you&#39;re here
I studied the brain in love and in 2005
match.com the internet dating site came
and asked me why do you fall in love
with one person rather than another
there&#39;s many cultural reasons but I
wondered if biology could also play a
role you know people will say we have
chemistry what do they mean by we have
chemistry so I began to study the
biology of personality there&#39;s two basic
parts of personality does your Nate
nurture which is everything you grew up
to believe and do and say and think and
there&#39;s your nature your natural
dispositions of course with epigenetics
these are constantly in contact with
each other the nature nurture argument
is over it should be dead
nevertheless there&#39;s patterns to nature
and there&#39;s patterns to culture so I
began by studying I by going through all
of the academic literature looking for
any trait that was linked with any
biological system and as it turns out I
found four of them the dopamine
serotonin testosterone and estrogen
systems so I decided what I would do is
create a questionnaire to measure those
traits linked with each one of those
brain systems and then put that
questionnaire on a new website a
division of match.com called chemistry
comm and then watch who&#39;s naturally
drawn to whom at this point the thirteen
million people have taken that
questionnaire in 40 countries and we&#39;re
all a combination of all of these these
are brain systems we&#39;re not types
they&#39;re brain systems but we do have
personalities so I&#39;m going to whiz
through them and then tell you one of
the things that I learned if you are
very expressive of the dopamine system
in the brain you tend to be novelty
seeking and risk-taking the academic
term is sensation-seeking you have many
interests these people are most likely
to go to college they make the most
money and they lose the most money they
explore not only physically but mentally
as you&#39;re doing today they tend to be
optimistic independent impulsive and
reflective they look
not in and their most primary trait is
there mentally flexible and its idea
generation they&#39;re very creative a good
example would be Richard Branson as he
said the last thing he said I&#39;ve always
thought that rules were made to be
broken probably a lot of the people in
this world would agree with that another
example would be ylang-ylang the concert
pianist dare dazzling Flair charisma
youthful barato bravado daredevil
extremes these are two very different
personalities but they&#39;ve got the same
temperament that expressed by the
dopamine system in the brain the second
type is those expressive of serotonin I
call them builders I had to make names
for all of these various types of people
because I was working with the dating
service they tend to be traditional
social norm conformity in fact we&#39;ve now
found that region in the brain they like
the familiar they&#39;re not scared but
they&#39;re cautious they&#39;re calm is why you
take something like prozac or paxil to
drive up the serotonin system to make
you calm er they follow the rules they
respect authority they like plans and
rules and schedules they like to be
literal concrete they&#39;re very good at
numbers religiosity is in the serotonin
system actually at least part of it is
one of the most interesting questions in
my questionnaire was with something like
would you rather have loyal friends or
interesting friends now we all want
friends then we all want interesting
friends but this type cannot tolerate
unloyal friends and the other three
types cannot tolerate mathematically
speaking cannot tolerate uninteresting
friends a good example is who chin down
former president of the People&#39;s
Republic of China as a matter of fact as
a gene in the serotonin system that is
linked with social norm conformity and
that gene is most frequent in China and
Japan
another example was a cookie-cutter
example of this type is Mitt Romney the
third oh these types some go for each
other
additional wants traditional and
creative curious spontaneous wants
curious spontaneous creative in this
case similarity attracts on the other
side high testosterone and high estrogen
differences attract they might love each
other but can&#39;t understand which planet
they are on they tend to be it&#39;s the
academic term is being good at
rule-based systems they are good at
computers engineering math music they
tend to be inventive exacting rank
oriented competitive a matter of fact if
you inject testosterone into a dove or a
lizard it&#39;ll start to fight for rank
they&#39;re emotionally contained a decisive
bold and direct these are the ones that
scream get to the point a good example
is Steve Jobs you can see it actually in
his face the high the high cheekbones
the heavy brow ridges in the strong jaw
are all built by testosterone a good
female example I think is Hillary
Clinton when she was asked why she was
attracted to Bill she said he wasn&#39;t
afraid of me the forth of these four
broad styles those expressive of
estrogen estrogen makes oxytocin these
people tend to do what I call web
thinking it&#39;s the way the brain is built
in the womb
and they&#39;re imaginative as a matter of
fact there&#39;s many more women in this
category and I do think that this
imagination the way the brain is built
gives women a tremendous asset in the in
the modern business world they tend to
have executive social skills they can
read posture gesture tone of voice
they&#39;re intuitive they see into your
head and can say what you need to hear
they are nurturing we call it pro-social
trusting is a very interesting thing
because you know if you trust the wrong
person you&#39;re sort of up the creek but
if you trust the right person you
actually save a great deal of metabolic
energy and you can see the way these
brain these traits will evolve together
if you trust the right person you got to
be able to figure out who people are and
they mavala this ability to not only to
trust but the size of people so you can
figure out who to trust
they tend to be introspective they look
in as well as out they seek harmony
they&#39;re emotionally expressive and they
have what I call diplomatic intelligence
Oprah Winfrey is a good example and I
think Bill Clinton is a good example you
know people are always wondering when we
are gonna get our first woman president
I think we&#39;ve had our first woman
president whole world knows he can&#39;t
stop talking mostly Express he&#39;s the one
that cried at his daughter&#39;s wedding not
his wife and of course he feels
everybody&#39;s pain I think Darwin is a
great example of the combination a
brilliant combination of a very
expressive of dopamine and the estrogen
system we are putting people into brain
scanners we&#39;ve done two studies so far
I&#39;m working on it absolutely daily we&#39;re
beginning to map some of the brain
circuitry of personality style and won&#39;t
go into that I will end with two things
a story and the one thing that I&#39;ve
really learned for millions of years we
grew up we evolved in a little hunting
and gathering bands there were about 25
individuals to a band 10 or 12 of them
were children about 10 or 12 or grownups
they&#39;re all going over a hill together
and they suddenly see some mushrooms
well you can&#39;t have all the high
dopamine type saying let&#39;s try the
mushrooms you got to have some of the
high serotonin type saying it&#39;s not in
our tradition to try these mushrooms you
got to have some of the high
testosterone types who say let&#39;s make an
experiment and feed the mushrooms to the
gerbil and we got to have some of the
highest Regine type who say let&#39;s sit
down and and and and pull our data about
these mushrooms the bottom line is we
evolved to put our heads together and
indeed I think the one thing I was
trying to think of this how to end this
this morning and I thought to myself
what do you really learned Helen and
this I think is the most important thing
that I&#39;ve learned from all of them
to him modestly say that I don&#39;t anymore
agree in the golden rule instead of
treating others as you want to be
treated the point would be to treat
others as they want to be treated and
you will reach into their heart and win
thank you
[Applause]
