good evening three years ago today Jill
tarter stood on this stage and announced
her TED wish which was to empower
Earthlings everywhere to become active
participants in the search for cosmic
company today with the launch of SETI
live that wish comes true
SETI live is an unprecedented
improvement in the search for alien life
and I&#39;d like to take the next few
minutes to show you what we&#39;re up to
every day the Allen telescope array
scans our galaxy looking for alien
signals the telescope observes a
different star every 90 seconds but the
quantities of data that we collect a
vast and in fact scientists have spent
decades trying to build algorithms that
can search in real-time for interesting
signals and yet there are still bands
that we can&#39;t look through because
they&#39;re too crowded and this is where we
need your help we&#39;re taking a live
sample of data from the telescope and
sending it to our citizen science
project satellite
we need citizen scientists that&#39;s people
like you and me to help us characterize
the signals as we upload them and this
is what this is just a SETI live will
see remember this is a live experiment
and so visitors will see what the
current status of the telescope is what
they&#39;re observing and how many
collaborators there are on-site people
would be presented with these data from
the ATA and they&#39;ll be asked to mark the
signals and to characterize them the
number of people mark the same signal
then the telescope will interrupt its
observing schedule and re observe but
it&#39;s a race we have three minutes that&#39;s
hopefully just the time I spend on stage
today to classify the data coming from
the 88 before this telescope moves on
and observes its next target so where
are we looking well as recently as 1992
we only knew of one other star in our
galaxy with an exoplanet that is a
planet going around it but calculating
the fraction of stars that have
exoplanets is absolutely fundamental to
working out how likely it is that life
exists outside of our own solar system
thanks in a big part of this telescope
the NASA
a telescope over the Kepler space
telescope over the past decade we&#39;ve
increased the number of known exoplanet
candidates systems to more than three
thousand this really is a golden age for
exoplanet discovery new planets are
found almost daily and some of them by
citizen scientists on our sister site
planet hunters rather than being unusual
we&#39;re now becoming becoming to believe
that planetary systems may be
commonplace in December 2011 NASA
announced the discovery of Kepler 22b
the first earth-like exoplanets in the
habitable zone or as we like to call it
the Goldilocks zone where the surface is
not too hot or not too cold and just
right for liquid water on the surface
SETI live is targeting these Kepler
candidates this is the most targeted
search for extraterrestrial signals ever
made the discovery of an intelligent
life outside of our solar system I
believe would be one of the most
significant events in human history to
date I&#39;d be delighted in fact I&#39;d be
honored if you would join me in this
most profound of searches thank you
[Applause]
