changes in technology are
so fast we sometimes failed to consider
the implications of those changes today
what I&#39;d like to offer you is three key
ideas around the ethics behind how we
handle data that can offer us maybe some
insights into some of the changes that
we&#39;re living through today in 2015 after
the earthquake in Nepal a global relief
effort was organized besides dollars one
of the key resources that was brought to
bear was data data from governments
corporations individuals nonprofits and
Geo&#39;s was directed into resources like
the humanitarian data exchange and new
shaheedi to map and direct aid likewise
in Liberia in 2014 during the Ebola
epidemic there was an effort to trip use
an effort made to try to use call detail
records from mobile telephone providers
to help to map and stem the spread of
the disease and while progress was made
towards this goal had it been able to be
done faster and in real time many lives
would have been saved and that a
catastrophe averted so what this brings
up is the need for a framework of data
government governance so what do I mean
by data governance a system of ethics
that we start to use to think about this
massive amount of data that we&#39;re
starting to accumulate from all kinds of
different sources now we&#39;ve heard about
government data government data we you
know we know that we are accumulating as
taxpayers and we&#39;re contributing in that
way so we&#39;ve asked the government data
be opened but what about corporate data
things like social media and from
private public partnerships and from
telephone companies what about data from
the emerging Internet of Things or data
from individuals that they may be
collecting with their own devices and
having their own data stores or other
kinds of data from nonprofits and NGOs
and lastly newly emerging kind of think
of entities like data collaborative that
are actually correlating data from
multiple data sets that we can start to
use to bring to bear new insights on
many of our toughest problems so think
for a moment also about some of the
corporate data that&#39;s out there think
what your life would be like if you
weren&#39;t able to use tools like Google
Facebook YouTube Twitter you&#39;d kind of
be a second-class citizen and in some
ways you know you&#39;re really compelled to
use many of these modern services so to
the extent that you&#39;re using these
services and you&#39;re being told that
privacy
is dead you&#39;re really being told to
contribute into these data sets without
necessarily getting anything back now
what I&#39;d like to show you is a couple of
maps that I&#39;ve made this is a map that I
made of st. Louis Missouri this is not a
geographic map this is a map of the
Twitter users of st. Louis Missouri and
what this shows each dot represents a
user each line represents a follow
relationship and each color represents a
community of shared relationships and
what you can see on this map is that
there&#39;s tremendous segregation in st.
Louis in the lower left of the map you
see it&#39;s primarily young
african-americans and on the far right
you see it&#39;s primarily white geeky
people and on the upper part of the map
you see it&#39;s mostly young white students
but what&#39;s interesting is the gap in the
middle there&#39;s no one in the middle
connecting those two branches of the map
which suggests a tremendous amount of
separation and divided in a city like
st. Louis which of course contributed to
some of the things we saw in Ferguson
here&#39;s a map of Istanbul that I made and
one of the key things that you can see
here is of course different cohorts of
people but there&#39;s one group of people
young men mostly frustrated young men
who really really want girls to like
them and they write poetry to prove it
and those folks are by far the largest
cohort in Istanbul and they stand at the
opposite end from kind of the
established business community as well
as religious and political tweets and
also sports acts as a connector between
these communities we can learn a
tremendous amount about how a city like
Istanbul works by looking at something
like this now we&#39;ve also seen a variety
of social media driven revolutions and
movements around the world over the last
five years or so whether we&#39;re talking
about Tahrir Square or gizzy park or
Hong Kong what have you there&#39;s a
feeling that to some extent these social
media devolutions have fallen short of
some of their goals and I believe it&#39;s
because people are trying to use social
media is kind of a black box with the
feeling that somehow or another if they
put the information out there it will
magically reach its intended recipients
I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case and
I think that one of the reasons that we
one of the things we need to consider is
the idea that if we&#39;re contributing to
these data sets we need to get access to
them in some reasonable way so I&#39;d also
like to talk quickly about encryption we
keep hearing about the debate around
encryption the fact of the matter is
strong encryption is a solved problem
there is no debate around encryption
what&#39;s a debate is the implementation
now you know we we&#39;ve heard just
yesterday in fact that the FBI in a
tremendous active over each has started
to try to use the all writs Act of 1789
to compel Apple to make a special
version of iphone software that would
break all iphones encryption going
forward that&#39;s a really unacceptable
solution to this problem and I would
propose that we need to start to push to
get real strong encryption to be
recognized by all governments as a
fundamental human right thank you thank
you we skipped back to the last slide to
the air we go i also want to just talk
about anonymity for a second we should
remember that countries like the United
States were founded using tools like
anonymity the federalist papers were
published in 1787 under the name of
publius Publius was actually Alexander
Hamilton James Madison and John J
pushing to try to get the newly written
US Constitution actually adopted it had
that not been available as a tool it&#39;s
unclear that the Constitution would have
been adopted at that time so we need to
remember that tools like anonymity in
today&#39;s world are equally legitimate
tools and we shouldn&#39;t be trying to
figure out ways to crush anonymity we
should be trying to come up with ways to
support it so in conclusion I believe
that corporations have an ethical data
to use private aggregated data for
societal good and to protect it from
those that would do harm I believe the
individuals have a right to access the
data sets that we&#39;re creating together I
believe that we have a right to
encryption and I believe that we have a
right to anonymity so our task our task
is to create a world that is both robust
and just enough to not only survive but
to thrive when all of these rights and
responsibilities are properly recognized
