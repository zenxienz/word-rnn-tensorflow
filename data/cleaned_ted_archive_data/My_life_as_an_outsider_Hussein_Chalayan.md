good afternoon everybody
today I will share with you my journey
of an outsider
I work in the fashion industry and I
pretty much receive all the activities
of a designer
we do biannual shows in Paris we have
our own temporary spaces I spend a lot
of time in fittings however I&#39;m a bit of
a missed it in the fashion industry
because while at boss tyrunt a
commercial business
I also embody the art world make films
installations and I show them in
galleries and museums interestingly this
condition has given me the freedom to be
an immigrant within various disciplines
fusing unlikely worlds and cultures and
this is it helped me to embrace
dualities in my own life and in my work
and many of the work I&#39;ll be sharing
with today wouldn&#39;t be possible had I
not worked in this way this picture age
11 in my room and Cyprus probably marks
the roots of my outside the condition
you can see the book in the corner which
represents my obsession with technology
based on aircraft you can see the white
desk which was the first piece I was
lucky enough to design and my interest
in the world of women is marked by the
dressing-table in the corner that
belonged to my stepsister these are some
of the titles I&#39;ll be sharing with you
today that informed the work and I&#39;ll
first start with separation when I was
seven I was sent to England from North
Cyprus to study in boarding school and I
pretty much felt separated from my
mother I felt I was too young to really
go abroad and in those days it was very
expensive to communicate by telephone so
we used to write Arab Graham letters to
each other many years later I decided to
look at this situation and it created
the airmail clothing series which is
addressed you can write on you can spray
perfume on you can wear you can wash and
I like to hear the idea that you can
send the dress to a loved one and maybe
this dress can become
a token for absence or your presence
unlike a dress that you can send by mail
this was a dress I covered in iron
filings and I buried it in the ground
for several months and after I dug out
the dress I felt that the dress actually
acquired his own life and became what I
call a piece of future archaeology here
I was interested in the idea that a
garment that has a certain value now
could become part of an archaeological
archive of the future
during the atrocities in Cyprus in the
60s between Greek and Turkish Cypriots
my mother&#39;s family had a warning that
there was going to be a raid in her area
and many years later I asked her what
was the first thing you thought about
taking with you at that moment in time
and she said to me old photographs and
food then I decided to look at this idea
and take it a lot further and I started
to look at how you could carry your
possessions with you much more
efficiently so I looked at how you can
transform furniture in order that you
can carry them away quickly at the time
of war and this led to this next piece
I&#39;ll show you
Hey
me
and say
so talking about having to move out of
your home at the time of war and the
displacement that creates the next film
is a meditation on how much moving
around and the isolation is just
creating the journey starts from London
and goes to Istanbul ends in the
Bosphorus which and which divides Asia
and Europe
another aspect of our lives which I find
fascinating is this need in which our
lives are evolving from the speed of the
body to the speed of consumption to the
economy and inertia the next project
starts off with the crystallized moment
of a crash as a result of speed this
isn&#39;t a gallery environment then in a
fashion show and this is its most
commercial and let&#39;s say accessible
ramification swiss shoe with the
developer puma this idea is probably a
very good example of how one thought can
lead to three forms of expression in a
gallery environment fashion show and as
an accessible usable product going from
speed one of the most modern experiences
in the world the next project is about
looking at the past and how religious
ideals of the past has been replaced by
our obsession with lifestyle in Dolce
Far Niente I looked at juxtaposing an
ethereal image of the body
inspired by Jacob&#39;s Ladder hence the
hands climbing up the body and looked at
how I could fuse that with image of the
body from the French Riviera from the
60s I was raised by women so for me in
my fashion is very important to empower
women and the kind of woman that I
project is is a woman that
self-confident and who is not an object
and who doesn&#39;t have to hide behind her
clothes
here the the peeping lady is hiding
behind the clothes but in fact she was
merged with the folds in the garments so
in arm side Leila you will see the
previous image from Dolce Far Niente
and here the Turkish singer setup arena
is actually wearing a piece of clothing
from the previous Fashion Show that you
saw this is the 3d print of her done
five years ago and it took us actually
three days to print unlike some of the
demonstrations earlier in the week and I
wanted to really say that music is a
very big source of inspiration for me
because I find that it&#39;s the most
profound kind of let&#39;s say experience we
could have and visual people try to
create the same effect but I feel they
can never really create the same impact
here I look at Turkish classical music
because this music is evolved from the
cost pollination of many cultures in
that region and I&#39;ll show you an excerpt
from this project
you
Oh
as a three-year-old I was obsessed with
the bionic man and at that time I was in
I was in London with my parents and my
father said to me that we were going to
actually go and visit the bionic man
and as turkish-cypriots never go
empty-handed I would also take some
Turkish Delight for him and we drove
from Finchley North London to Madame
Tussaud and because as a three-year-old
I have no concept of of distance and
time I actually thought we drove to
America to see Steve Austin and this
project next is probably the is the
reason why I actually went ahead because
I was interested in technology from that
age and I guess interested in the
apparent impossibility of technology for
this project 111 I wanted to make
dresses that could run themselves bit
like Bionic dresses and thematically I
wanted to look at maybe how the
environment could affect the image of
the body
for instance of wars have have led to a
disempowered or an empowered image of
the body or how movements have led to a
liberated image of the body here I
worked with people from many different
disciplines mechanical engineers
programmers people that had never worked
on projects like this before
and we developed six dresses I will
share with you five of them which
morphed mechanically to actually mark a
change of an error in each dress and you
will see an excerpt of this as the
finale of the show
being an immigrant within different
disciplines has allowed me to discover
worlds that I wouldn&#39;t have never
discovered otherwise and I&#39;ve learnt to
seek that outside the status is a
privilege allowing me to see that alien
worlds can coexist and can inspire each
other even leading to also connections
that might eventually actually end up
developing new disciplines altogether
thank you
you
