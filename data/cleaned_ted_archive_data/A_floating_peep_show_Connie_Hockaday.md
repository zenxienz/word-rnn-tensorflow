hi this past summer I did something I
never thought I would do I opened a
floating peep show you know where you
pay money to look through a little
window at people without their clothes
on yeah I never thought that I would
ever surrender to being an artist I had
a lot of shame around it I was afraid
that I wouldn&#39;t make enough money that I
didn&#39;t actually have any ideas of my own
and that I wouldn&#39;t be doing enough with
my life and I was also hung up on this
totally flawed belief that all children
not only have the capacity but should
live a life that is better than their
parents as in wealthier and more
professional thank God I finally figured
out that that&#39;s not true the planet
can&#39;t even support that kind of social
mobility and so I&#39;ve allowed myself to
become more like my parents instead of
better than them and in my case growing
up queer on the us-mexico border at the
tip of Texas by the water with the
Chilean librarian mother and a good old
boy marine biologist father has left me
rich with skills for navik
yeah for navigating cultural
complexities and the ocean I used boats
in the water to come into direct contact
with that place where the social and
physical realms intersect I&#39;m looking
for openings in the way we is a society
order space so how does a lot of help
with that because water is constant
motion we can&#39;t own it it&#39;s an
undefinable rent free space under
maritime law which somehow upholds this
inherently natural notion that living
beings have the right to at least
temporarily own the space that their
physical bodies occupying and also they
have a right to a freedom of movement
somehow it feels like the social order
of land seems to forget about these
basic rights and so water keeps things
in perspective in this way it requires a
certain kind of participation an
embracing of its temporality and this
constraint is where I find the very
material of my creativity the place
where I&#39;ve found room for formal
considerations of things that just do
not have direct outlets in our political
reality this past summer I wanted to
have a conversation about the changing
city of San Francisco so I did that by
opening a floating peepshow it was the
most natural thing I could do in the
face of the whitewashed predictable
suburban lifeless flattened reality that
is displacing the very texture of our
city working class people queer people
of color artists but what really tipped
the project into motion was when two
clubs culturally rich in queer and
radical history shut down within six
months of each other the first was the
lusty lady the nation&#39;s only
worker-owned unionized peep show
the dancers in the workers literally ran
the club for themselves and then there
was esta noche a celebrated latino gay
bar located in the Mission District the
Latino neighborhood in San Francisco
with places like these finding it harder
to survive on the land I decided to
reopen some iteration of them on the
water the floating peepshow was made of
four thirty foot old sail boats that
were rafted together I hired dancers
from the lusty lady and drag queens from
esta noche to perform inside of the
halls most of them had come of age in
these clubs develop their sexual and
gender identity within the walls of
these places they were a powerful and
diverse collection of people each of
them individual and multi-dimensional
over the course of four nights my sailor
friends and I transported over 600
audience members in small inflatable
boats to the floating peepshow and most
of them had either never been on the
water never been in a boat or never been
to a peep show it was a completely
impossible task the boats broke every
single day and I was afraid the entire
time but I wanted to make an opening in
the world so much more then I wanted to
be afraid of things falling apart I
wanted to believe that it&#39;s possible to
take a risk like this to approach the
world with familiarity to be that thing
out on the water that looks like a
portal a tear and social order proof
that another world is possible and
probably already here the success of the
project though is very simple we gained
a confidence that we could converse with
our changing environment on our own
terms even though we have no idea what
will come next we found that we&#39;re not
alone in our roading urban land
skate this work that I do with the water
is about a particular kind of survival
it&#39;s an exercise in confrontation and
change in loving a particular shape that
the world makes and in the same breath
watching it die and come into another
shape again thank you
you
[Music]
think about
so so nobody was killed nobody was
killed no drowning nobody drowned or got
hurt just one fight with an angry drag
queen come on that&#39;s par for the course
I know everywhere you have an angry
droid creams true just I&#39;ll dress up and
we&#39;ll meet later and i&#39;ll hit you we&#39;ll
work it out okay yeah I think she makes
a lot
[Applause]
