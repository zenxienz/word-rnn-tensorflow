good evening everybody
I&#39;m an Afghan girl from the rest
province of Afghanistan near to Iran
border I know when we say about
Afghanistan the first thing that comes
to your mind is always bombing war and
conflicts but no today I&#39;m going to show
you the other phase of Afghanistan which
is the positive story of my life and
other girls in Afghanistan so I was born
in Iran in 1985 from an Afghan parent I
finished my high school in Iran and then
I moved back in 2001 to Afghanistan
after the collapse of Taliban regime so
I studied computer science in 2007 and I
graduated from the computer science
faculty in my country after that a 2008
I got the chance to go to Germany to do
my masters in information technology
meanwhile that I was sobbing in the ER
in Germany to do my master I got an idea
how I can help women in IT because it&#39;s
a difficult technical field of study
especially for women in developing
countries so I went back to Afghanistan
I started my career as a professor in
the university and meanwhile I
established an IT company with my friend
Roy Emma hoop called F considered a
software company to help women in
Afghanistan to empowerment to empower
them through social and digital media so
there are a lot of problems during the
projects that we have in Afghanistan so
I told myself that how I can try to help
women in Afghanistan in morale is really
about your struggle
sadly and run service organizations and
angers to help and support humans the
other education and Bauman dealt on your
background what is go online life and
longer or shorter leaders interior feels
like what we&#39;re calling is ours hardly
I try to interview Oracle and I try
philosophy opinion about how they can
help to rental humanist animals and I
try to broadcast them to the women in
Afghanistan so I&#39;m here in the United
States I want to use the chance to
deliver the message on women in
Afghanistan alone so I try to plan ways
we are the social media travel with men
so I try out next time we ask and girls
or in this goal they can for people hear
or see to delay try to share the ideas
with the girls I&#39;m against letting
whatever I&#39;ve done was a very infinite
independence also variables we know all
these 100 papers or being clever at them
that I sometimes I couldn&#39;t dream about
that so during the ops and those and
these journeys I understand one thing
that women need education so we
established women&#39;s and extra health
girls in Afghanistan so to the idea that
we had is so how empower women I know
women empowerment is a little bit very
confusing and a difficult word if I want
to use it in my own country but I learn
it from my mom she was in power at home
so no man power in my home so I learned
it from my mom and I try to give you to
the other women who are in Afghanistan
so the combination of education plus
digital media makes a huge difference
we give the girls who are in schools to
common line share their stories using
social and digital media power so it
means that they can come online they can
tell you that when they are in
Afghanistan what&#39;s going on and what&#39;s
their stories so in the other hand it&#39;s
not just about the education we give
them the opportunity to come online
share their stories and of course get
paid so they become more financial
independence in their projects that they
are doing and one of the main reasons
that we are going to support them so
like me that I have a chance to be here
maybe they cannot be here but they can
go online and share the stories with
people around the world and they got to
know about them and the situation of
women in Afghanistan so at my other
story I was born in Iran I went to
Afghanistan I was in Germany for me
well that borders doesn&#39;t mean anything
for me the real char Ward is important
because it gave me an identity I could
come online and share my stories with
people and then yeah communication
without borders when there is no
geographical boundaries people in a
second can go to different places in the
world without having any problem or
nobody I&#39;ll see your passport hopefully
so all these things together they helped
me to do this mission with my friends to
build computer media labs for girls in
at school in Afghanistan and help them
to come online and share their stories
so since we started the project we built
Janis comes out of 40 schools in
Afghanistan and 60,000 students they
come online and they share stories with
people around the world and of course
what what I focus on that is everybody
can be a thought leader but if you give
them the right tools which is education
and social media for girls in
Afghanistan we find local talent there
are thousands of the students who can do
everything but unfortunately they don&#39;t
have access to the right tools so we
will find them and we will help them so
these all together helped us to empower
women in developing countries especially
in Afghanistan through digital and
social media and education I would like
to end up my speech with one of my
favorite beloved poets who said where
there is room there is hope for treasure
for sure
thank you
[Applause]
