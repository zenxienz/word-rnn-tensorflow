ah folks I&#39;ve been living with a biochip
for almost two years now it&#39;s a very
small piece of hardware with some memory
and antenna in it covered by so-called
bio class which essentially makes the
chip friends with human body most of the
time the chip is asleep it doesn&#39;t
require any power so essentially any NFC
reader which could be anything from a
smartphone to a subway turnstile can
power up the chip I want to touch it so
it enables reading writing capabilities
and when I&#39;m done the chip goes back to
sleep technically I can&#39;t interact with
anything all you need to know is how to
code but you must be wondering why did I
do that so yeah right so in the ear of
Internet of Things I really wanted to
learn what it&#39;s like to be machine how
does it feel to be part of it so I
performed hundreds of experiments on
myself so basically I learned how to
open doors with no keys how to unlock
smart phones with no pins how to log
into websites was not password cetera et
cetera and of course of course as a Star
Wars fan I couldn&#39;t resist the
temptation of the light sight so with
some money tuning of Microsoft Kinect in
some weird engineering we made this door
obeying my force push which technically
technically makes me the first Jedi JJ
something to think about it so but the
main breakthrough didn&#39;t come up from
this experiment actually it came up from
an experiment that nobody thought to
become big so we set up a laptop and a
smartphone so I could live my normal
life with one minor difference I would
use my bio chip is the only form of my
internet ID which means literally that
we were tracking my like every second of
my private digital life and the result
stunned me basically when we looked at
the data at my data we started to see
patterns so the way I type the mistakes
I make that I mean the typos the way I
move the mouse everything the routes I&#39;m
taking every day the vocabulary I use in
my private messaging all that of course
had some you know elements of chaos and
instability in it but overall and
instead the more I tracked myself the
more predictable I am
my life looked a bit programmed from
very specific blocks that were free
specific to me if it doesn&#39;t make sense
what I&#39;m saying so this is where I hit
me my personal data all the time
is something that&#39;s very complex but at
the same time it reminds me of something
human DNA because if you think about it
and this is basically why I called my
invention digital DNA because
essentially human DNA is a IQ type
manual to our bodies right and digital
DNA I think is a layer it can be
considered a layer of a human DNA anyway
they&#39;re inseparable because human DNA if
you think about it it contains physical
data
we&#39;re very specific for example like
probability of certain diseases or let
you have blue eyes digital DNA contains
it&#39;s very similar it contains
information but you as a character as a
personality right and I think that
everything connected to the web has a
personality a digital identity who will
and I would argue that this very digital
DNA is in fact the foundation of
artificial life the part of life that we
are now part of and you know when I
started my experiment I was feeling very
optimistic and enthusiastic about the
biohacking
thing I still AM the problem is the chip
made me see the terrifying future that
our kids would have if we do not change
the attitude to private data you see in
1992 there were roughly 1 million
computers connected to the web
computers were manufactured and marketed
installed as tools and we were users the
forecast for 2020 is roughly 50 point 1
billion devices and it&#39;s kind of
different because they are not tools
anymore
they are an interface between life and
artificial life and we are not users we
are sensors for a huge system that we do
not own or control the problem is is our
digital DNA&#39;s today they belong to
everybody but us and of course most
people they do not understand the true
value of their digital dnas it&#39;s ok it&#39;s
going to take time to get there but the
problem is the lack of awareness does
not give the right to corporations to
use as tools
you see access to billions of digital
DNA
can be used for manipulation we are
exposed we&#39;re vulnerable every every
flow we have can be actually exploited
for example you don&#39;t want to buy
something you don&#39;t want to waste money
on some stupid stuff they would find it
tailored to you motivation you know that
would work specifically for you and you
won&#39;t resist because essentially what
digital DNA is is a cheat sheet to your
you know to your psychology to your
brain into your life right if you think
that this is not relevant to you you&#39;re
wrong it&#39;s a proof fact that computer
would always beat human a chess but it&#39;s
not because the machine is smart it&#39;s
because it has a very very huge database
of the best players on the planet and
another fad but database of all games
and all moves ever played so they made
you start playing it actually starts to
see a pattern analyzes your moves income
ups comes up with all your moves before
your tiny human mind come up to those
very decisions and I would tell you you
know horrifying stories for the whole
night but it&#39;s not the point
the point the point is it&#39;s not chess
anymore behavioral analysis is being
used for like to change to alter our
behavior they make us do things we might
do differently for example when was the
last time you were pushed online - by
Gary Miller or Hemingway or Dostoevsky
today&#39;s we are being pushed you know
marketing messages that are honestly
some BS because we&#39;re being told that
let&#39;s say privacy is something you used
to pay for free service the truth is if
the product is free the product is you
and privacy is just a made-up word that
in fact means freedom and freedom is not
for sale
freedom actually is something that is
ours but by birth and we have full
rights to protect it especially when we
feel that someone is taken away from us
and that being said let me share a crazy
observation with you today I&#39;ve been
terrified away cyborg uprising like
since forever but I&#39;ve never could have
imagined that I would become one of them
so the good news is
my team and I were working on a solution
for that a very high-tech thing that
hopefully would get us back into the
driver&#39;s seat because digital dnaesda
must belong to the rightful owners
people who would decide how it&#39;s being
used and if you indulge me I really want
to change the world thank you thank you
very much
