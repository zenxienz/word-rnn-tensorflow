we live in an incredibly exciting
universe look up and you see a sky
filled with visible matter stars planets
galaxies but there&#39;s also dark matter
that you can&#39;t see
in addition 70% of the universe is made
up of dark energy a mysterious enigma
that is responsible for driving the
acceleration of the universe I have the
best job in the world I want to
understand what makes the universe tick
and change but let me take you to a dark
city street without hit without
streetlights if you were trying to cross
the street in such a beautiful amazingly
strange landscape this image by Jared
Levy of Manhattan darkened by Hurricane
sandy can take us there and if you
wanted to cross the street safely you
would lose the headlamps of oncoming
traffic to tell you if it was safe to
cross the brides of the headlamps the
clothes of the car would be to you and
you&#39;d know it&#39;s probably better to stay
on the sidewalk but how do you know how
to do that if you grew up in a city you
know it&#39;s just built in the ability to
calibrate brightness with distance and
yet it relies on one key fact that all
car headlight headlamps are made equally
intrinsically bright that allows you to
turn them into what we call standard
light sources or standard candles we do
the same in the universe as a whole as a
cosmologists I&#39;m interested in
understanding how the universe changes
with time how it is expanding and how
its geometry changes I do this by
measuring bright objects in the far
distant universe this incredibly
beautiful image of a galaxy with its
dusty spiral arms and it&#39;s hazy central
bulge which is made up of a composite of
data from distant different telescopes
by bj Fulton is beautiful in its own
right but I&#39;m more interested in the
after image
in which you can see a stellar explosion
in the outskirts of the galaxy we call
that a type 1a supernova now supernovae
come in many types but the type 1a
supernovae we believe come from an
explosion of a white dwarf star this
white dwarf has lived in a companionship
with another larger star and has been
pulling material off the star feeding
itself until it can&#39;t resist the crush
of its own gravity and it explodes often
brighter than so that it outshines the
galaxy that hosts it we can see these
bright objects very far into the
universe the important thing is that
these type 1a supernovae explode
everywhere in the universe with roughly
the same mass they also have the same
amount of chemical elements like iron
and nickel and so they explode with the
same brightness they become cosmic
standard candles standard light sources
in the dark night because we know how
bright they are intrinsically and we
measure how bright they appear to be
they become just like those headlamps
and we can use them to calibrate the
distance to the object we want to
measure the distance to these objects
very far away because because of the
constant speed of light the further away
we look the further into the universe&#39;s
past we&#39;re looking the reason why we
want to do that is because we want to
understand this dark energy at different
times in the universe how much dark
energy was there when the dinosaurs were
on the earth I know you&#39;re all worried
about that how much dark energy was
there when the solar system itself was
forming these are all incredibly
important questions because we want to
measure these distant objects they
become fainter and fainter and we need
bigger and more impressive telescopes
with which to do that the large synoptic
survey telescope is currently being
constructed in the Atacama Desert of
northern Chile LSS team you can see how
large it is by just comparing the tiny
human figure in the image LSST is
enormous and it&#39;s going to give us an
amazing view of the cosmos it has a 3200
megapixel camera
if you think the camera in your phone is
roughly a hundred times even if it&#39;s
very good phone it&#39;s a hundred times
less than that and LSST will scan the
entire sky every three days try doing
that with an iPhone just to see what
LSST will show us we&#39;re going to go and
zoom in on a patch of the sky and look
how it changes as our observations have
changed
we start with digitized old photographic
plates and we&#39;re going to zoom in on one
galaxy look how it changes with
observations next we go to the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey itself an amazing
survey that revolutionized the field
that I work in the deep lense survey
gives us an even crisper and clearer
view but it was a much smaller serve and
into the whole sky but these simulations
of what LSST will see show us just how
our view of the cosmos is going to
change we&#39;re going to see incredible
objects that we&#39;ve never imaged before
so this is great right this there&#39;s no
problem what&#39;s the catch well let&#39;s
imagine that all the 1000 currently
known a type 1a supernovae are like this
fish awesome well understood we can see
it very clearly we know that we can use
it for cosmology and that&#39;s fantastic
but LSST is going to give us roughly
100,000 candidate type 1a supernovae per
year for 10 years that&#39;s a million
candidate supernovae we&#39;re now going to
have a data set that looks more like
this it&#39;s great we had a lot of data but
we won&#39;t be a hundred percent sure that
every point is in fact a type 1a
supernova and is relevant for cosmology
we want to make sure we use the data
effectively so that we get the correct
answers but also use the power from this
huge school of fish luckily the Reverend
Thomas Bayes can help with that Bayes
lived in the 18th century and was more
interested in religion and gambling but
actually his statistical theorems can
help us today to illustrate just how
Bayesian statistics works I&#39;m going to
use another analogy because as
scientists this is something we love to
do imagine I told you that today I
rocked up here using my own person
dragan okay you don&#39;t believe me clearly
but if we just look at the data at hand
I&#39;m standing on the red dot my theory
explains that perfectly so why don&#39;t you
believe me you&#39;re relying on a prior
knowledge that dragons don&#39;t exist in
fact that prior knowledge is so strong
that it overrides the fact that I&#39;m
standing here today
bayes&#39;s theorem allows us a way to
quantify that the way of balancing
whether or not my theory explains the
data which we call the likelihood and my
prior belief in how realistic that model
is in the first place
we call this the prior I use Bayesian
cosmology to understand this large data
set that I&#39;m going to get from LSST this
school of fish or we&#39;re not a hundred
percent certain which is or isn&#39;t a type
1a supernovae that&#39;s our prior and we
use this to understand cosmology so here
is something the results that I got from
a simulation of LSST like data and what
we interested is constraining the amount
of dark matter in the universe that&#39;s on
the x-axis and the amount of dark energy
on the universe that&#39;s on the y-axis
everything within one of these ellipses
is this is indistinguishable from one
model from the other and so we want to
make those ellipses as small as possible
because that&#39;s saying we have a tighter
and tighter bound on our cosmological
model now the problem is we want to be
centered around the bright star in the
middle of the yellow ellipse I simulated
the data and so that&#39;s the right answer
but if we just use the huge data set
without paying careful attention to the
prior we in fact get something that&#39;s
shifted away so the blue ellipse and
that&#39;s the wrong answer and we&#39;re not
doing correct cosmology I&#39;m really
interested in not only being precise but
getting the right answer in the universe
because I want to understand how the
universe works we live at an incredible
time at the moment because we have new
observations that are going to give us
access to incredible parts of our cosmic
history I can use in mazing data from
wonderful telescopes and advanced
statistics to unlock the secrets of
amazing universe thank you
so can I ask you a couple of questions
please so just to make sure I understand
you use supernovae as constants to
measure the rate at which the universe
is expanding is that right right we use
the brightness of the object and that
gives us the distance and those
distances tell us about what the
universe is shaped like and how it
behaves of time because you can imagine
if it was a little bit further away
that&#39;s like stretching space out so we
can measure these distances to tell us
about what shape what the space the
shape of space is and if you learn what
the shape of space is what do you hope
to learn from that so that tells us
literally what is the universe made of
because from general relativity the
stuff in the universe changes what it is
shaped like and how it changes with time
so you know you are what you eat the
universe is the same way right well I
guess that is an important thing to
learn
so the LSST it looks so cool I was
wondering if you need a library card you
do you need know the great thing about
these big international collaborations
and things that are sponsored by involve
the US is that eventually the data will
be public so people can play with it and
find their out their own things I&#39;m
getting involved now early on and I&#39;m
kind of buying myself a library card
into Alice&#39;s tea so that I can also be
involved in understanding how we&#39;re
going to design the surveys working with
colleagues to say can we look for these
stars in a better way and how can we
integrate together really well so one of
the questions we hear people talking
about in the quarters of Ted all the
time is can you give us just a tiny
process of dark matter versus dark
energy just a really quick this is
literally my favorite question like
literally so two seconds dark matter
dark energy dark matter behaves like
matter so it has gravity it
gravity acts the same way it&#39;s invisible
okay so dark matter is me in a Harry
Potter invisible jackets dark energy is
crazy so like me anyway no dark energy
is very strange it acts like an
anti-gravitational
so nothing about dark energy makes sense
it&#39;s acting exactly kind of against the
way we would normally think of it and
there&#39;s actually we call it dark energy
because we don&#39;t know what it is but
it&#39;s you can think of it more as kind of
kind of anti-gravity force okay that
actually I actually think I understand
that&#39;s good and in the in the universe
of all pieces of the universe what is
like the percentages of each thing so we
have most of the universe is dark energy
which is a problem because we don&#39;t
understand it
sorry blame the universe not me and then
we have roughly sort of 25 percent of
the universe is dark matter and less
than 4% of the universe is stuff we know
so you me stars planets gas all of that
is less than 4% so I know the Kepler
mission to look for signs of
intelligence lot of potential exoplanets
which could support life was only
looking at a tiny piece of the sky right
so how much can the LSST see so LSSC
will scan the whole sky so in fact
rather than so you know kepler would
look at one detailed patch but LSST is
what we call a survey telescope so it&#39;s
designed to measure like quantity rather
than just only a small bit of sky so
it&#39;s this kind of whole sky every three
nights it&#39;ll do that you just get this
massive bucket of data the data all the
time and then you have to interpret it
figure out using Bayesian statistics and
other ways
one last question are we good to go by
the way we&#39;re good okay great we just
having a chat um well actually I asked
you my questions uh but can can I come
visit you down and Chile and like will
you take me in and like show me why this
is the this is I&#39;m gonna kill the dream
now this is the thing about being a
theorist is that I I&#39;ve never been to
Chile I want to go but for science it&#39;s
actually cheaper for me to have a
computer so you can come to my computer
but I&#39;m not
it&#39;s much less sexy but the food is
really good the food is great at my
house yeah bye sweetie
Oh
