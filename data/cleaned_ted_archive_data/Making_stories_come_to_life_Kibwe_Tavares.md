when I was younger I wanted to tell
stories I wanted to tell stories through
animation and I was a massive computer
geek of into all sorts of software and I
was got into this new world of CGI and
animation but at some point I decided I
was going to be an architect somebody
somewhere along the line I think is my
dad told me that I should do something
proper so I studied architecture and
then for the next eight years I&#39;ve spent
trying practicing and studying
architecture I don&#39;t have to design I
learned how to use the skills I&#39;d learnt
to design spaces to take things from the
visual to the actual built environment I
also learn how to manage to break down
huge projects into tiny bite-size pieces
for the last two years I of my study and
I went to a very open and conceptual
school it was called the Bartlett school
of architecture and we used animation
and film to talk about our architectural
ideas and architectural theories I saw
this a massive opportunity to take a
side steps left and go back to all the
things I was really into when I was
younger so look elephants the robots the
kind of massive towers all the stuff
that could be very creatively and this
all came to a head in my final thesis
projects which was a short film and
animation program design project called
robots of Brixton and robust of Brixton
was a project that changed everything
for me because it allowed me to go full
circle back into what I really wanted to
do which was an tell stories and tell
visual stories so this is rose what&#39;s a
Bricklin playing now and this was a
retelling of the 1981 race riots in
South London and it was an important
story for me to show because it it was
an event that happened at the start of
my life and it was a vendor gave by the
black community in England and the UK a
voice and essentially put me in the
position I was in today as a young
academic black written and I&#39;ve wanted
to retell if I didn&#39;t want to tell it
straight I didn&#39;t want to tell it in the
very kind of black way I wanted to tell
it in a in an accessible way a way that
people be drawn in by the visuals and
then they&#39;ll be engaged by the story by
that way
and and it was a huge success it won
awards but the biggest success was it
reached hundreds of thousands if not
millions of people from all walks of
life academic school kids film birth
loads of people knew about this project
and it touched him and they could have
their own commentary on it and what that
allowed me to do is with as I said
before go completely full circle and
start being a visual storyteller and if
i disturb you this traditional methods
not as many people would have seen in
order still being on DVDs and peoples
and cupboards but what amendment
companies like the film institute film
for and shine pictures in the UK saw me
as a filmmaker they wanted to develop
and a filmmaker they wanted to invest in
as well as allowed me to start an
animation studio called set to assisting
and together we worked on a short film
the show up a big magical realist film
about the world&#39;s biggest jump in fish
is coming soon and this film is set in
Zanzibar and it&#39;s this the fifth changes
everything it sounds as the van to this
huge cut from this idyllic fishing
village to this huge tourist town and
these are the sort of stories I want to
tell stories that have a important
social message or social and political
message embedded into this visual world
that people are drawn in and embraces
and I think as I like the shape and
design worlds as I move into this new
industry of film I&#39;m hopefully going to
chase it informant in a small but
significant way because I think there
are lots and lots hundreds and thousands
of filmmakers like me put in their work
out picking up their cameras animates
and stuff putting their stuff online and
sharing the river wide community and
these people aren&#39;t they aren&#39;t confined
by the commercial narratives that you
need to have because they&#39;re making it
for the art and I think these are this
is the future of filmmaking for me or
the future filmmakers as they&#39;ve got new
stories to tell in very different ways
thank you
