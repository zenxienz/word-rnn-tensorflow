so before we start correction my name is
Karl Joshua Dube and I am the biggest
Zimbabwean stand-up comedian in the
world okay thank you thank you I need
all the encouragement I can get because
comedy has taken me as a mob and
comedian to over 37 cities around the
world applause again thank you thank you
thank you thank you 36 of those cities
are Zimbabwe but the whole idea is that
I get the opportunity to see some
amazing things like I&#39;m so grateful to
be back here in Tanzania legally and and
so I&#39;m here to talk to you about the
fact that I am afraid of Robert Mugabe
so Robert Mugabe is our president and
he&#39;s been president of our country for
37 years
okay I&#39;m 38 okay
38 our president is 94 years old 94
years old you know what they got him for
his birthday a wheelchair okay
they got him no they got him a
wheelchair and they put spin on it and
they said no it wasn&#39;t a wheelchair it
was a massage chair which I was like
yeah right who gives a 94 year old
anything that vibrates for their
birthday right and so Robert Mugabe
right has been prison for 94 years old
and I&#39;m afraid to make jokes about
Robert Mugabe and it&#39;s quite simple like
Americans can make fun of the apes&#39; and
and they having fun by the way right and
so
they&#39;re having fun and the reason why
they can do this is very simple right
they can make fun of their president
because America has over 15 flights
leaving the country every day if I made
fun of Robert Mugabe today I&#39;m not even
sure that s Babu is flying out of Arusha
this week race or that they even flying
out on time
I&#39;ll probably be at the airport a week
later with some douchebags from our
embassy hitting me under my feet saying
what were you saying about our supreme
leader like that would totally happen
and and and so I am so afraid I&#39;m so
Frank I even you know when I travel like
I&#39;m on a world tour okay okay exile
whatever you want to call it but I&#39;m
gonna will talk and I suffer I suffer
from for what we call president Envy you
know you travel around the world you see
how the media talks about other
presidents look at Donald Trump walking
up into Air Force One
look I&#39;ve led me a Putin sitting on top
of a bear without a shirt on right do
you know what they say about our
president on the news yes
he&#39;s walking he&#39;s still walking what I&#39;m
sorry is - okay so I&#39;m president so
president fell right EP fell what one
time and it was viral on the internet
people making jokes about our president
falling it was so many memes I even
trouble because he was trending on the
internet I even have to travel all the
way to South Africa just to watch him
focus back at home our internet was
still buffering so so in Zimbabwe Robert
Mugabe on our internet is still standing
in fact it&#39;s the only 40 years old right
record it so sorry it I got to perform
for Robert Mugabe once though and and
you know like it you know it&#39;s as what&#39;s
customary is that the security agents
they came to our house they were really
nice they not they knocked on my door
tied me up whatever but they were really
nice and he said listen listen you&#39;re
about to perform for the president right
a couple of things that you shouldn&#39;t do
like firstly please don&#39;t make fun
because we believe in your talent but
please don&#39;t make fun of the President
don&#39;t make fun of the first lady don&#39;t
make fun about the first family don&#39;t
even make fun about the foreign
dignitaries that we have there please
don&#39;t make fun of any service delivery
issues don&#39;t talk about potholes
electricity don&#39;t talk about any of
those issues but cow we believe in you
[Applause]
and so I almost contemplated like
quitting stand-up comedy and pursuing a
career in cooking like having my own
cooking show but also the other reason
was that I was kind of sick and tired
being in Zimbabwe right watching cable
TV and seeing Jamie Oliver cooking with
ingredients we can&#39;t find in Zimbabwe
hey do you know how annoying it is
because you want to cook along with
Jamie Oliver at home right and you can
you imagine what it&#39;s like in Africa
cooking along to Jamie Oliver you&#39;ve
paid your subscriptions and jamie
oliver&#39;s on TV and he always says some
stupid stuff like welcome to our cooking
share we&#39;ve got some nice easy
ingredients stuff you can find in any
help from around the world what we gonna
start off with is something simple like
a nice juicy bit of salmon
[Applause]
rice
and then what you want to do what we
want to do is want to chop up some till
we&#39;re gonna chop up some deal we&#39;re
gonna sprinkle it all over all salmon
salt slowly that&#39;s my jb very busily and
then what we wanted you just to lift off
those wonderful flavors we&#39;re gonna grab
some baby asparagus we&#39;re gonna put it
all over all salmon salt and then this
is a really important stage what we
gonna do is we&#39;re going to grab our
salmon we&#39;re gonna put it into an oven
that&#39;s been preheated at 180 degrees
that is 180 degrees
[Applause]
so in a nutshell what I&#39;m trying to say
is that my sense of humor has nothing to
do with how happy I am it&#39;s actually a
symptom that I&#39;m afraid my name is Colby
and I&#39;m afraid of Robert Mugabe thank
you so much
[Applause]
