can I go back to that previous life
I have been working with a group of
designers and artists the group is the
group&#39;s name is called yes yes no two of
us always say yes and the other one has
to say no we&#39;re like this mostly
positive or with some criticality one of
us it&#39;s an architect who deal with space
who do weird things with space using
hardware and digital fabrication one of
us is that I like to do weird things
with cold open-source software and I
like to do weird things with electricity
like making things move connecting
objects to something else or just do
weird things with objects recently we&#39;re
invited to create a project that the
explore the relationship between health
and water drinking for the first lady
Michelle Obama&#39;s nonprofit partnerships
were healthy America so we decided to
create this chatty water fountain that
every time when you lip when your lips
lips touch the water it has left you and
when you live move away from the water
stop talking so our first prototype are
made out of cardboard
in other stuff that off the shelf and
then we&#39;re able to work and collaborate
with the bookshop that is above upstairs
from our studio and we put the
open-source software and hardware inside
the water fountain to make it kind of
intelligence that to make an impact with
us
oh excuse me
so much when you touch it it sucks me
nitration only one glass of water people
don&#39;t really drink from the water I want
that happy people make happy project I
just need you to help me remember that
so we really like to hack objects and
turn into an element of surprise we&#39;re
invited by Google to create to connect
object to create a project that connects
to an object and we witch&#39;s shoes
so which we choose we we got 20 pairs of
off-the-shelf sneakers and we turn them
into this the project called the Google
talking shoes so what we did was we use
a series of sensors and we embed it into
the shoe inserts and with the speaker in
a mobile phone the shoes is able
commented on the wear itself in real
time
I like listening to industrial music
while I run am I supposed to be
impressed okay to hire next time and
that just seems to be a Super Bowl
I was diggin before it legit we have to
travel with issues of Middle Ages moment
when the security in the airport come
out and it is like what is it what is it
hi ooh a battery is something else and
what are they doing but shoes talk to
you and then everybody&#39;s happy they&#39;re
just checking it tonight on really talk
to you and then they let us do we&#39;re
invited to created a project for London
2012 the Cultural Olympiad on behavior
in school so some of you might not know
the Hadrian&#39;s law is this border of the
Roman Empire and we&#39;re invited to create
this project on the wall that inverts
and invert the concept of how a borders
separate people to something that
connects it with us what we want to do
we want to connect people so we created
a a serious it&#39;s like a fullness of
objects they&#39;re a series who created a
series of 2 meter weather balloons each
of them have electronics inside they&#39;re
high power LEDs and in radial modules
that allow the balloons to talk to each
other and people are able to talk to the
balloon so the Hadrian&#39;s Wall is
throughout its 76 miles of the long wall
and we wanted to
whoo we wanted to set up his balloons
along the wall and just kind of create
this connecting dots the project&#39;s
called the connecting life so it was
kind of almost like a Impossible Project
for us we we set it up in New York and
then we have 50 Mahlon tears come out
and help us setting up the balloons the
bullies have to be pattered and we set
it up across here in Brooklyn in New
York and then we had to England before
we know before we know what&#39;s going to
happen so I would I would like to what I
would like you to know that this project
is really not going to be possible
without the volunteers we have
volunteers helping us assemble volunteer
helping us setting up and so we&#39;re where
we were as soon as we arrived in england
we&#39;re setting up things in this farm and
we tried to see if the life are actually
coming to it and be able to communicate
with each other and I&#39;m ready
[Applause]
for the car what we&#39;re trying to do is
to set up the balloons across the wall
and on the night of the event it&#39;s a two
days event the participants use their
cell phone use our website and start
typing messages and these message are
going to be translated into color
information that passed down along the
Hadrian&#39;s Wall it&#39;s going to be 200 to
400 weather balloons and on the night
before they then I was training Alan
tears and the technicians and we just on
the date of the event we have to set it
up in a small office where we can
actually sit behind our computer and
monitor the whole system health of 400
weather balloons and bridges in sizes
offices and not really be able to go in
outside and that&#39;s when our volunteers
they travel along the wall each of them
have to set up about 20 to 40 balloons
and it were just
just please remember that the moment
that the cows love our project and the
project becomes a that we can with
something that we can actually see the
volunteers our eyes and they&#39;re the only
people that can actually tell us what&#39;s
happening and it&#39;s a project that&#39;s so
hard to document because it&#39;s so low and
so large and it&#39;s the only way we know
it&#39;s from our participants I was second
at Carlisle for the Olympic Festival
connecting light and that was the most
successful bike of the whole experience
first off they were it was better the
second night because we tended the wines
better we&#39;ve touched the balloons the
bottom skirt you know that worked really
well and like doing I kept you safe you
went up too high on the first night and
all over the place a lot of positives
one from the crowd of people come in
where people sexually messages and they
were quite an intimate scene and come on
so it was really good it looks like you
we had a rifle just operate the building
looking at where he was and yeah the
children really love touch them because
when they came down fit the children
want to come close yeah yeah Wendy would
be really challenging but good old ed
came out
yes normally anybody at night yeah we
could we create this traffic jam these
are people here and seniors come on in
like your big license in Washington yeah
fight about me how are you actually on
the website we ask the participant
answer questions like what do you say
what is what kind of borders do you
cross what kind of connection do you
make where are you from say something
about love and we&#39;ll just leave the
question blank say something
and one of the answer that we got while
we&#39;re sitting in the tiny small office
on close to Hadrian&#39;s Wall which make
someone smile tomorrow and I like to
think that our project is here to make
people happy and to make their
connection to people in it what what if
the simplest thing that can possibly
work happiness you have to work thank
you
[Applause]
