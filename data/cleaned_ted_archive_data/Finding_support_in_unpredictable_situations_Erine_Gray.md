this is my mom she&#39;s smart she&#39;s tough
and she&#39;s a real character when I was in
high school she caught a rare brain
disease called encephalitis and when she
got back from the hospital she didn&#39;t
know who we were not only did she lose a
big chunk of her memory but she used to
have seizures which meant she couldn&#39;t
be left alone my family did the best we
could we didn&#39;t have a lot of money we
couldn&#39;t afford sitters but we rallied
that was 22 years ago and although
that&#39;s a freak thing to happen to
somebody I realized that most of us are
going to have something crazy happened
to us at some point a loved one gets
cancer maybe you lose your job and your
face with eviction fortunately there is
a safety net for basic needs those are
going to be filled in the United States
but it turns out the majority of the
Social Services Human Services in the
United States are provide provided by
nonprofits and local religious
congregations so if you ever are in a
bind where do you start if you do a
Google search for senior care in Austin
you get 50 1,000,000 results it&#39;s
confusing you&#39;re already stressed out as
it is if you&#39;re in this situation so in
2010 I wanted to I started aunt Bertha a
fast friendly and simple way to find
services available it really all just
starts with a zip code it&#39;s super easy
we pull in all of the available
resources we index them you can drill in
by category here&#39;s a program that can
help you for example maybe you have a
loved one who is recovering from surgery
or you know someone who got into a car
accident this program will actually help
you build wheelchair ramps on your house
if you can&#39;t afford it for free that way
you can recover at home with your family
most people don&#39;t even realize that
these services are available and the
really cool thing is you can add your
income anonymously and will tell you
which services you qualify for for
example a family of four making a
thousand dollars a month can qualify for
three hundred sixty eight dollars in
food stamps
shortly after we launched we started
tracking search results and we started
to see what people were searching for we
found people in dire situations
searching for housing or food but we
also found parents of disabled children
just looking for support groups we even
saw people that were just running what
if scenarios what if I lose my job well
my kids have health insurance turns out
a big chunk of our users are social
workers they like it because they can
spend less time researching and more
time getting to know their clients
clients like my mom I took this picture
shortly after I went away to college it
always reminds me of the sacrifices my
dad made for us he did a lot for us but
one of the things that he did for
himself was he used to go bowling on
Thursday nights but he gave it up so my
sister and I would have as normal a life
as possible which meant going to track
meets hanging out with our friends and
even getting to go away to college since
I started this project so many people
have come up to me and shared their
stories and i can tell you none of them
are looking for a handout but they could
use a break every now and then
unfortunately we live in a world with
generous charities that are ready to
give you that break we just want to help
you find them so if you ever know
somebody who&#39;s in a bind or perhaps
maybe yourself someday there is somebody
who can point you in the right direction
her name is aunt Bertha she&#39;s tough
she&#39;s smart and she&#39;s a real character
thank you
[Applause]
