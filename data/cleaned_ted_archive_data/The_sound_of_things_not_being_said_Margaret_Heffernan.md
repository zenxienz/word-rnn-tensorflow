I want you to listen to something do you
hear it
I hear it all the time it&#39;s the
cavernous sound of things not being said
I listen to silences in organizations
and meetings because quite often they&#39;re
much more articulate than what is being
said a few years ago I met a young woman
named Susan who worked on the call
center of a large cosmetic cosmetics
company and a new product was being
introduced she was being told about it
her manager said he was hypoallergenic
never tested on animals all those great
things she knew there were standards and
certificates for this sort of thing so
she started to ask about them look it&#39;s
just fine he said brushing her query
aside and leaving in the room an awkward
silence at night she told her mother
what had happened at work she said she
didn&#39;t really feel very comfortable what
was she going to say to people if they
called up with allergies or skin
diseases her mother gave her a great
piece of advice she said well don&#39;t just
sit there do something about it we all
get stuck in those moments of awkward
silence surveys show that 75% of
executives have issues and concerns at
work that they simply don&#39;t voice in the
United States the reason given is fear
of recrimination in Europe its futility
as since it won&#39;t make any difference so
fear of utility you can take your choice
the upshot is the same our silence
guarantees no change
the next day Susan went into work and
she talked to some of her colleagues
were they worried - yeah they said but
they didn&#39;t want to make trouble they
were sure it was legal I don&#39;t want to
be legal Susan said I want to be right
she had a friend in product marketing
and he laid many of her concerns but he
wasn&#39;t so sure
about the hypoallergenic art did many
people call in about that
oh yeah said Susan allergies are a very
big deal the phone script changed and a
few years later a new brand emerged
nobody ever gave me any credit for this
Susan said to me but you know every time
I look at those bottles I think I
started that we all have questions and
doubts and concerns at work and for the
most part we do nothing about them so
what should you do well it starts with
questions are you alone are you the only
person who&#39;s worried
we all have hunches and you know
sometimes we&#39;re just wrong but if it&#39;s a
big problem the chances are other people
have noticed it too it continues with
questions small questions that are easy
to ask and therefore easy to answer has
anybody thought about does anybody know
more about I wonder if do you think we
could
these aren&#39;t declamatory questions
they&#39;re exploratory questions you can&#39;t
answer them with a yes-or-no so they
stop and they continue a conversation
they are designed to drive to a
conclusion they make everyone&#39;s search
for a conclusion when you allow this
kind of exploration to occur what
happens is you make or you create allies
people who go down the road with you
reach their own conclusions so now you
know more you have our lives
you aren&#39;t exposed and you aren&#39;t alone
the cost of silence is around for all of
us to see and out of gray in the
Catholic Church in the banking crisis in
any industrial accident you care to make
all circumstances were hundreds even
thousands of people knew something
wasn&#39;t quite right but did nothing many
of us of course won&#39;t have to work in
situations quite as critical or
disastrous as those but we all live and
work in places where something is
begging to be said and the magic of
asking questions is it the more you do
it the easier it gets it&#39;s like any
talent or muscle the more you practice
it the more powerful it becomes
try today at lunch with colleagues or
with your family over dinner after all
that&#39;s what family dinners are for not
just to eat but to practice the finals
of question and expiration with people
who simply can&#39;t fire you there&#39;s
another cause - silence - and that&#39;s all
the things that could happen but don&#39;t
there isn&#39;t a company or industry I&#39;ve
written about or worked in that at some
point didn&#39;t face an enormous economic
social technological financial challenge
then everybody knew about but nobody
dared to mention but when you dare to
disagree that&#39;s where creativity and
innovation begins what gets in our way
is the idea that we have to know all the
answers but you don&#39;t you just have to
know how to ask a great question one of
my very best technology ideas came about
when I dare to ask an Internet veteran
do you think it would work if now this
could have been really embarrassing I
could have revealed my bottomless
ignorance but as it happened it kicked
off a conversation that led to something
real has anybody thought has anybody
noticed what have we tried these are the
kinds of questions that uncover what&#39;s
wrong but uncover also the hidden
potential that lies inside
organizations are technologies and in
ourselves we all have these questions
knocking at our head begging to be let
out and when we dare to let them out we
discover who we are
another hero of mine Cynthia Thomas the
army wife from an army family did this
she had a lot of questions about the
young men coming back from Iraq and
Afghanistan they looked fine but she
says that something was wrong she talked
to doctors she talked to veterans why
was nothing being done was it really
that simple publicly and prominently she
set up a place where veterans could get
help support psychological counseling
where they could feel safe and Cynthia
said something to me that everyone in
this situation has said to me she said I
never used to know what I wanted to be
when I grew up but now I know I found
myself in this cause and I&#39;m not the
same person anymore ask questions
connect the dots make allies change the
game the heroes of our age are the kings
and queens that stand on pedestals on
city streets there are people like
anybody in this room that knows the
power of a great question followed by
another one and another one and another
one the questions that don&#39;t stop until
we all had to think again you ready
