so if you&#39;re anything like me
occasionally you watch the disaster
unfold on TV feel terrible about and you
don&#39;t do anything so there&#39;s this big
gap between your intentions which are
very good and what you actually do and
this is a really big problem facing all
sorts of people
Satan&#39;s people who are trying to extract
aid from you when disasters if it&#39;s true
about anyone who runs a non-profit they
can be true anytime you&#39;re trying to get
people to be generous when they feel
that the cause is important this is a
big issue and it&#39;s probably a big issue
because of how much we&#39;re talking about
money-wise so if you look at disasters
every year disasters come to about 100
billion dollars that&#39;s how much damage
they do which is so much that two-thirds
of the countries on earth will be
bankrupted if you would it take what
they were worth and put them towards
dealing with those disasters so we&#39;re
talking about is huge sample money and
what I&#39;m going to do today is I&#39;m going
to suggest a very very simple
intervention that&#39;s basically free it
doesn&#39;t cost much at all but it
increases giving sometimes two sometimes
three sometimes even ten times so
basically to start what I want to do to
illustrate this idea this is a strange
way to begin perhaps or what I&#39;m like
giving this to look at the letters of
the alphabet the Roman alphabet I&#39;d like
you to think about your three favorites
it&#39;s a task you probably haven&#39;t engaged
in before you spend in maybe a few
seconds thinking about this okay now
what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m going to ask
you to raise your hand if at least one
of the letters happens to be the first
letter in your first name your middle
name or your last name what 95 99
percent of you massive massive majority
certainly true for me I&#39;m very attracted
to the letter A and that&#39;s a very common
response it&#39;s a sign if you all think
reasonably highly of yourselves to
commit activity and so that&#39;s a good
thing this seems like just sort of an
oily interesting fact but it also turns
out to be a very powerful idea
suggest something about how we might
approach people to encourage them not
just to feel like being generous is
actually in James I&#39;m going to get to
that in a second but the basic idea is
that we like things in the world around
us that remind us of ourselves that
carried something about ourselves in it
so that&#39;s certainly true of members of
the alphabet it&#39;s true with the way
people pick a lottery numbers this is a
data Smith views of the National Lottery
in the UK so what I&#39;m showing you here
it&#39;s all the numbers from 1 to 49 and on
the vertical here this is how common
they are how commonly chosen our the
most common number I&#39;ve given a value of
100 and this is what you see so you see
some are more common than others you can
see for example that the lucky number 7
is the most common but what&#39;s really
striking about this is you can break the
numbers down into those that refer or
apply to birthdays and those that don&#39;t
and this is what you see so the green
ones a birthday related the red ones are
not birthday related and when you
interview people they are dramatically
more likely to pick the numbers that are
associated with their own birthdays and
sometimes with the birthdays with other
people so even though this is a random
draw they have drawn to these numbers
they think they&#39;re going to be luckier
with those numbers it&#39;s ok so I&#39;m in
fact that addition say that if you&#39;re
going to play the lottery hit numbers
that are higher than 31 because if you
do win you&#39;re going to share your
winnings with many fewer people so
you see this is well in the way we pick
up haps is a fantastic paper it&#39;s about
ten years old now from a journal called
psychological science and what happened
was the authors took a whole lot of pets
and they separated them either extreme
example so what you find a bit later
people try to get who is the owner of
each pet when they match them together
they find that people are very often
accurate and the reason they&#39;re accurate
is because people like pet and look like
themselves so in the world at large we
like things that remind us of ourselves
even in ways you might not expect so the
way we like that we like that is the
reminders of ourselves from life numbers
we like pet the reminder to ourselves
so now having shown that I want to get
to be intervention so as I said we have
get the letters of the alphabet and I&#39;ve
shown you you&#39;re attracted in some ways
the letters that are associated with you
and in terms of that this is important
because we name a lot of things one of
the things we name our hurricanes so
these are two of the very damaging
Perkins from the 2005 Atlantic hurricane
season the most damaging season of all
time we&#39;ve got Katrina on the left and
Rina on the right and since you are
attracted to the letters or so
name&#39;s the researchers wanted to see
whether that might translate into
differential heading patterns and what
they found was that people gave two and
a half times more when they had pain
notes to Katrina des any of the other
hurricanes a year and people with our
names day three point six times in war
two reason if any of the other hurricane
page but there&#39;s rheumatic increase in
giving two hurricanes that happen to
share their first initials now as you
can imagine they&#39;re not saying that
reminds me of me I should give more
there&#39;s not an initial that&#39;s driving
this form of generosity they&#39;re going
beyond just saying I feel terrible about
the victims of this hurricane and
actually end up giving more it&#39;s a
pretty striking effect we can also use
this fact it&#39;s not just an interesting
idea retrospect but we can go forward
and use this to encourage people to get
more as well so what I&#39;m showing you
here again is that same picture with all
the loads and what you can do is you can
look at the way we main people in the US
and you can find out which letters are
more common has initials and I&#39;m going
to show you by changing the size of each
of these letters which ones are more
common so J and M very common a V are a
couple of the elves are very common
you&#39;ll also see that some don&#39;t even
shot because they&#39;re just so unconscious
very rare to see someone with a name
that begins with you compared to say the
letter J and once we know that people
will likely to view how hurricanes that
happened to have the same initial
let&#39;s get something about the way we
name our against the way we go now it&#39;s
just help of ethically so here I&#39;m going
to show you this is the list for 2015 it
smells of itical business 21 of the 24
letters are represented and what you can
do is you can calculate based on how
many people do they&#39;re these initials
what if what kind of boost you would get
if that part can happen to do a lot of
damaging we&#39;re trying to extrapolate
from people and I&#39;ll show you here it
varies pretty dramatically so what do
you find is that you know we hope there
won&#39;t be any damaging programs but if
this here hosting white hand happens to
do a lot of damage
we&#39;ll get the big boost from all the J
people out there who suddenly become
dramatically more channels the same for
Mindy unfortunately hurricanes Odette
and Ida are going to extract a lot less
aid because you get a much smaller boost
from that match between people&#39;s
initials in the name of the horizonte&#39;
package so what this suggests is that
when we&#39;re miss naming our hurricanes
once you understand how much in effect
the name has on giving that suggests we
should probably be a little bit more
careful and a little strategic with the
way we mean so what you find it
praval I can show you how much
difference makes if you look at the 27
most damaging hurricanes between 2000
and 2012 the donations for those 27
amounted to about 10 billion bolts
it&#39;s a lot of money you can run a
simulation and you can work out that if
you had made those hurricanes a little
more strategically so they mirror the
American population more effectively
that number will jump to ten point seven
so they&#39;re effectively leading seven
hundred million dollars on the table
because the Weather Service in the 50s
decided to tennis rather than use the
alphabetical list what this shows you is
help help in these first impressions
and how once you understand human
psychology what drives generosity you
can make very extensive changes to the
world and have dramatic effect on the
sorts of behaviors that people engage in
I want to show you another context
because if people are attracted to their
initials you can imagine how attracted
they are to their own names and formats
you&#39;ve probably all done this before
googled yourself and wondered if there&#39;s
anyone else out there who happens to
share your name and when you look and do
an image search you&#39;ll you&#39;ll find
something like this it&#39;s kind of
fascinating I met the Adam author on the
left here actually randomly hits his dad
actually contacted my family and when I
met his dad his name is Alan I think
that&#39;s so funny my name is Adam your
name&#39;s Alan that he said actually my son
has exactly the same name as the others
his name is Adam and we spend some time
together and hang out and it&#39;s amazing
how strong that bond is you know it
begins nowhere you don&#39;t know this
person at all but because you share a
name with them
it has a very powerful bonding effect so
what I wanted to do is sort Politis and
I did some work with DonorsChoose some
of you probably know about German
students in large organization and what
happens basically as teachers who are
working in public schools can apply the
crowdfunding so what you might do is you
might say I&#39;m a teacher I&#39;d like to work
on a project with my students but I
don&#39;t have funding I&#39;d like to build a
replica of good a ship for example and I
need some word in singular to crayons
and i need a 12 $100 and post that on
the side and then any of us could go on
the site and find that project or any
other project so what we did was one
valentine&#39;s day they send out at those
as series and emails it was a very big
big campaign
we vary the nature of the emails so here
is an email to read a missus is picking
a random person thing the one version of
the email was without a matching name
and so what they did was they sent out
this an email Gail Reena roses are red
violets are blue we have this feature
and hope you do too give today to the
classroom of mrs. Watson now notice the
mrs. Walter doesn&#39;t have the same name
as mrs. Miss Reed admitted but because
they have so many people in their
database they were able to match people
with teachers who happen to share their
surnames there are half a million emails
that went out after the matching and
half of the non matching so the matching
burden look like this dear reader roses
are red violets are blue get to a
teacher with the same name as you give
today to the classroom with mrs.
administer the teacher in New York New
York so it&#39;s a very similar email big
difference there is the name is matching
and this has pretty massive consequences
for giving and I&#39;ll show you what I mean
by that first of all you can see that
people are driven by this matching
property so Karen hit me from New Jersey
gave incentives in personam City and
mrs. Hickey to you can actually explain
why you&#39;re deciding to give typed LTA
from Fort Lauderdale&#39;s that Miss LSE a
keep up the great work for those kids on
by topping of Maine State and I think
it&#39;s Rosmer jamie bros mah found someone
who happened to share her name which is
an unusual one they actually found out
that were related so they started
talking offline about that so it&#39;s a
very powerful driver of connection and a
very powerful driver of giving I&#39;m going
to show you how powerful so the non
matching main version that every
thousand emails sent garnered about $10
the matching Man version
eighty dollars for every thousand emails
it&#39;s hard to get donations to go out by
just a couple of dollars
look the live to go up eight eight times
it&#39;s pretty dramatically
here&#39;s another metric so that every
email is open once people did open them
there were much more generous more than
ten times as generous when the person
they were dealing with was the teacher
who happen to share their name again a
pre chromatic statistic and finally if
you look at the size of the average
donation people weren&#39;t just more
willing to give when they did if they
felt much more generous so they gave
more than three times as much to the
teachers who happen to match their
pencils so that&#39;s this form of bonding
cost nothing to match people together in
this way it cost nothing to change how
we came out there it means but it has an
incredibly strong effect on how generous
people are not just that they feel like
being generous that actually behavior
works on any one other really
interesting statistic is that a lot of
the people who gave have not given them
for more than a year that&#39;s pretty
really usually people who don&#39;t give to
a course for more than a year are very
tough to get back into the fold and
these forty four percent of the people
who do with this kind of donor so
they&#39;re the toughest ones to reach for
so what I want to end with is the idea
that behavioral science understanding
why people give understanding how
powerful it is when you&#39;ve seen yourself
into cause beef workforce by 3/4 I just
mean the idea that you can convince
people with logic and reason to do it&#39;s
really tough to do that and that&#39;s the
way politicians work it&#39;s the way a lot
of the work in a lot of different
contexts now once you understand how
these very inexpensive interventions and
that means huge magnified effects you&#39;re
much better placed to extract audience
