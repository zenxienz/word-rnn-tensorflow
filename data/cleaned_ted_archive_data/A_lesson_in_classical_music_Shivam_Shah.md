all right classical piano is all around
us it&#39;s on TV commercials it&#39;s in
restaurants but we don&#39;t always notice
it
we don&#39;t always pay attention we just
assume that it&#39;s good classical music
why is that
why don&#39;t we notice why do we assume we
can look at the problem for my
psychologist perspective or as a
musician I don&#39;t look at it from a
pianist point of view how as a musician
can I create an unparalleled sound to
make you the listener believe that
you&#39;re actually listening to a higher
echelon of sound if you&#39;re not a
musician and you just listen to
classical music understanding how the
sound is created can better help you
appreciate classical music in my
generation many of my peers they don&#39;t
like classical music don&#39;t listen to
classical music they don&#39;t even believe
it&#39;s relevant but after studying music
it&#39;s clear that classical music inspires
other genres of music and current music
music like heart and soul or songs by
Frank Sinatra or Adele or John Legend or
Chris Brown so if we place two pianists
on the same piano and ask them to play
the same song there&#39;s a difference
between the experienced player sound and
the inexperienced player sound how do we
describe this experience sound well you
might say that it&#39;s more reverberant
there&#39;s more sonority it&#39;s a more full
sound
there&#39;s tone there&#39;s pulse there&#39;s
inflection it&#39;s as if the composer
wanted the notes to be in the air for a
specific amount of time I&#39;m going to
explain three techniques that pianists
use to create this authentic experience
sound these techniques are best for some
classical music written by people like
Beethoven or Chopin or athma enough or
Debbie say so how do we get this
experience sound
the first technique deals with the
knuckles so relax the wrist and I mean
really relax the wrist
relax the arm relax the shoulder and the
torso the entire torso and amass all of
the force in the knuckles this frees up
some of the sound that is absorbed by
the wrist and the arms it seems a little
crazy but it really makes a difference
let&#39;s listen to two clips the first has
a constricted wrist the sound is
constricted and there&#39;s not much
distinction between the melody and the
rest of the notes then we&#39;ll listen to
another technique we&#39;ll listen to the
same technique used correctly alright
everything sounded kind of mushy sounded
kind of the same now the change is gonna
be subtle
I&#39;ll grant you that but listen to the
second clip with the free wrist and
you&#39;ll be able to hear a distinction
between the melody and the rest of the
notes
okay so a lot of people that probably
sounded the exact same I get that but
over the entire course of a piece a
concerto a a symphony that technique
makes a huge difference let&#39;s move on to
the second technique movement movement
to an extent is great however a lot of
people see the pianist with their arms
flailing all around or scrunched up
close to the piano as the better more
mature pianist but that&#39;s that&#39;s not
really the case in fact the pianist that
sounds like him or her is having a worse
time or it looks bored at the piano is
oftentimes a more mature classical
pianist a good standard here is to
follow the notes so move - you have the
arms serve the knuckles to hit the keys
so if the notes are going up move the
arms up with the torso up don&#39;t just
move the wrist don&#39;t just move the
fingers oftentimes plank with the
controlled movement can increase your
technique and can increase your accuracy
so the ones on the left are a little
overly expressive with the hands you
know kind of like this about to strike
whereas the pianists on the right seem
more more like your authentic black and
white you know classical movies last
technique deals with the pedals alright
so when people begin to play piano they
oftentimes overuse the pedals you know
like when I was a little kid I would
just kind of hold the pedal down when I
was playing and everything sounded the
same so there&#39;s a pedal on the left that
quiets the sound and there&#39;s a pedal on
the right that sustains the sound it&#39;s
the sustain pedal that really can make a
difference so when playing classical
music many professional pianists play
with without really using this at the
sustain pedal too much in fact they&#39;ll
use it sparingly whereas most
professional team or other pianists will
just kind of hold the hold the pedal
down so what that means is you get an
unclear sound versus a clear sound you
get a you get an overly connected sound
versus the right amount of connectedness
also on an interesting note the sustain
pedal is not usually just on or off it&#39;s
usually pressed in levels so
professional pianists will actually
press it down 25% or they&#39;re all
depressed at 50% and sometimes the full
of hundred percent this alters the
amount of connectedness people will feel
and hear between the notes so let&#39;s
listen the two clips the first clip
wrong technique wrong pedal usage you&#39;ll
be able to hear how there&#39;s a melody and
professional pianists are good at making
the melody stand out but what matters
more oftentimes is the bottom notes the
notes at the bottom so really maybe
close your eyes and listen for the
bottom of the sound and you&#39;ll be able
to hear that it&#39;s an unclear sound then
we&#39;ll listen to it with the right pedal
so if you want join me in closing my
eyes can we play the audio
all right now let&#39;s listen to it again
but with the right pedal
all right hopefully I didn&#39;t just help
you all fall asleep again but did you
hear the distinction it&#39;s a little
subtle for sure but over the course
again through an entire piece that
really makes a difference so the next
time you hear a classical piano
classical music don&#39;t just write it off
take a second and think about it think
if you can hear the loose wrist the
flowing body and the tempered pedal
hopefully have helped you to appreciate
classical music a little more and
enhance your listening pleasure by
walking through how to make it clearer
reverberant sound in classical piano
thank you
