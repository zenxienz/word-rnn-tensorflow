my story is about love when I was five
years old I love to draw this was my joy
when I was five years old after an
obvious I love to capture this world
through colors life movement I capture
my life through my eyes and also my
heart I can something that lights up
your world paper cutting is a
traditional Chinese art but I
transformed it into this
three-dimensional architectural
landscape cause problems it&#39;s a very
small object that can transform an
environment paper cutting can also be
this piece is like a thinking they are
opened the London Fashion Week and Ezra
venice biennale i created this sculpture
that&#39;s inspired by the contemporary
architecture so here you can see paper
cutting doesn&#39;t have to be flat you can
be three-dimensional like this one for
the London design using inspired by the
river change when we look up is like we
capturing this London cloud and putting
our gallery this one was at the Hamburg
up week last year and I captured the
three of my favorite City London Hong
Kong and Bangkok into this sculpture and
12 50 scale so if you look into this
sculpture you will see people and their
architecture and events and fashion or
even sometimes up can be made with
something that you don&#39;t want like the
computer wires this is at the
Bloomberg&#39;s all head office in London
and I used their waste to create a
sculpture hanging in the Asian it&#39;s like
a cloud
sometimes it doesn&#39;t always sit in
galleries it doesn&#39;t have to be a flat
painting or some weird thing so we don&#39;t
understand it could be as simple as the
martini glass for example and it could
be a bed not inviting your room
addressing water or it can be a mural
that&#39;s so elegant and sexy a chair
doesn&#39;t have to be boring it could look
like this a wash hand basin could be a
60s and the smooth as a female body so
every time when you see it you want to
touch a piece every day no matter what
function or now function gives you it is
something that can light up our world no
matter how small like this champagne
glasses or champagne bucket or big they
are we spend a lot of our time at home I
think the home should also be art like
this one for example this is not in
Europe but in your spice more time right
unknown place in China called food chain
and here we are creating your penthouse
for Chinese family I think here
designers we understand to create a home
is like to build a dream so we make sure
that every single detail in this
penthouse is a magical space here is the
boys bedroom the boys bathroom every
detail is something that can create
imagination here is a kids living room
the daughters piano room and the
daughters bathroom this is one of our
clients she&#39;s two years old when we
presented her this new home she smiled
that&#39;s all it matters
to me as the designer this is a her
bedroom I&#39;ve has no boundaries between
past in the future the traditional
Chinese art and chinese garden can
inspire this the very exclusive club in
China and it has a teacher a Chinese
teasing so you go there you shop for
very exquisite T and you relax you
enjoying the inspiration came from
nature and essence is a boutique hotel
now you can relax and soak into this
earth like space is always about
emotions this is a passion pool and this
one is for a Chinese bakery brand in
shenzhen guangdong province which opens
in a few weeks time this chinese brand
understand that they are not selling
bread ok we are selling happiness and as
interior designers that&#39;s also what
we&#39;re trying to create in our design I
love fashion I was once made into a real
size papito by the British Council
representing the UK creativity I think
fashion is it can be a really great
influence to interior design this is
club we&#39;re building for the Fashion TV
brand in Dubai everything is like a very
elaborate dress imma advice more detail
that ever fashion designer uses almost
as a decorative thing but will enlarge
this to become this fabulous fashion
caf√© which opens a few open the last
month in Abu Dhabi so next time you are
in the Middle East please drop by thank
you also has no boundary this one is in
Cairo which opens next month here is
another one into buying at the aim of
Boulevard everything is like a voice
extraordinary extraordinary dress that
when you look at it you light up our
inspiration of fashion can be at any
scale you can be interior you can also
be architecture this is important that
we are also doing for fashion TV it is a
pre-fabricated result unit that looks
like Simon&#39;s we use the both technology
to create this fabulous environment that
can be shipped to any remote locations
in the world so this will be like
diamonds shining in the sea fashion is
something architecture never really
thought about but it is part of our life
and this light up all night I&#39;m feeling
is something we wanted to create in our
buildings this will be in Mauritius
house is one of the most expensive
things that one can buy in our lives
many people spend their lifetime savings
on a hundred square meter home that has
very cold walls and floors have we ever
asked how many people in this world
actually loved the house we bought so I
think why come to have to be like this
that&#39;s so romantic and beautiful and
every time when you&#39;re walking past by
you might fall in love why can&#39;t a house
to be very essential wave is the natural
elements that inspired our architecture
this one is mixed use development in
Fujian Province in China as architects
we often being criticized that we just
demolish things and field without
thinking especially in China people
criticize that we build things that has
creativity but here are the things we
are currently building now they are I
think of a extraordinary that ever tie
when you look at it it could be
something that makes your heart skips a
beat this is called wave full of all
it&#39;s another shopping mall inspired by
water here is the river mall we&#39;re
trying to create by insulating landscape
at the facade of the building so the
building is like a river needs a park so
a shopping mall doesn&#39;t just have to be
a square box it could be something that
offers the public for a beautiful space
to their city architecture is about
people this is a new project we are
currently doing nephew this week for
chinese bank who has the same passion
this is the f3 students we are doing in
indonesia a home can be so extraordinary
like diamonds in the sky i think
everybody secretly would want their home
to be something that when you&#39;re walk-in
past by you would remember you will be
proud of not just a box that looks the
same all the time this one was inspired
by the peach flowers it&#39;s a mixed-use
development in trento city in China we
take this extraordinary local element
which is the flower and translated into
our architectural design in China
everybody coincides with built large
things blocks that looks the same but I
don&#39;t think that&#39;s true this one is our
project is mixed use development for
shopping malls specializing in car
so we&#39;re taking the elements from the
movements of cars and applied it into
architecture each building is very
different although they still have to
accommodate it is very big volume for
the Chinese requirement I think there is
no boundaries between our design and
architecture nothing is impossible with
love we want you to create things that
can engage emotions we want you to
create love to design this is our office
as artists designers and architects I
think our role is to make this world a
better place that&#39;s full of love thank
you
