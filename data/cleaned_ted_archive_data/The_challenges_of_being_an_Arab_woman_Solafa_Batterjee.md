hello everyone do you know what this is
what is this yes it looks like a baby
doll but unfortunately it&#39;s not it&#39;s a
bomb me peace be upon you all my story
starts in the 1970s in Saudi Arabia a
story of a little girl who is like any
other little girl all over the globe who
believes that her dad is her super dad
the super dad has taught this little
girl taught me three life-changing
lessons lesson number one to be shy as a
woman but brave as a man not knowing
that that little girl had always wished
if she had been a boy because to be able
to live my dreams in a male-dominated
society I knew that my life had to be
led differently and it was I had my
super dad as a role model the super dad
visionary man has constantly told me the
sky is not even your limit this person
who had held my hand constantly raised
me believing that in a society as in
Saudi Arabia women are a rich source of
intelligence and collect and leadership
that because I am a daughter a wife and
a mother I can do what no man can do I
can raise the future of my gender by
empowering the young female generation
of Saudi Arabia
this little girl grew up and her
father&#39;s lessons grew harder it was 2004
three years after the 9/11 twin tower
bombing on that day it was the
engagement of my little sisters it was
the day when the engagement of my little
sister on that particular day the
Security Council of the United Nations
announced my super dad an al-qaeda
sanction list as a terrorist they did
that because he built wealth in Africa
hospitals in mountains and caves he was
a father of twenty thousands orphans a
supporter of ten thousand widowers and a
financial leader of sixty million
dollars spent on health care and
education because he empathized with the
young of Ghana kids who lost their parts
because they played with bombs that
looked like this doll ten years passed
and my super dad was called agent Qi b1
a2 or for throughout these ten years
that father thought that growing woman
taught me lesson number two that pollen
therapy is number one job for each human
on earth that as human we should find
joy we should find joy in serving others
especially those who are in need as
Lauren Miller said in her book wired for
joy when we take action that favours the
greater good our whole system our body
chemical system rewards our whole human
system with power and peace
and eventually joy if you don&#39;t know the
difference between pleasure and joy then
you haven&#39;t yet begun to live till news
passes with global sanction on travel
trade and frozen assets continuous
investigation by UN US national
international investigators and three
times rejected appealed for justice
my father has taught me to be patience
throughout these ten years this father
has took this little girl by her hand
and told me
lesson number three believe in justice
each human is deserves to have a
justified life yes it needs persistence
and patience but as humans as long as we
continue to choose to learn think and
dream then we are free beings after 10
years and with the support of Judge
Kimberly procced on the mid of January
2013 my super dad was announced innocent
he was delisted from al-qaeda sanction
list the UN couldn&#39;t find anything
against him that wise peaceful man spoke
to that little girl inside me and told
me my young lady this journey has
reached its conclusion
always devote your time for others it&#39;s
what keeps the universe balanced my box
of dreams keep on feeding from these
three lessons this whole experience
created a powerful woman and depends a
powerful independent woman out of me
a woman who believes in herself as much
as I believe in my super dad it has
created a change agent who believes in
education as a tool to change society&#39;s
above all that it has created a human
who invests her time and philanthropy my
future vision is to inspire philanthropy
through the young generation so through
them together we can let unbalance the
universe thank you
