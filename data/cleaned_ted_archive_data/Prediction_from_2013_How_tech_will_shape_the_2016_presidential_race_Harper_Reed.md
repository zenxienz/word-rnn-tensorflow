politics is changing and I want to tell
you a little bit of politics how it&#39;s
changing but first let me tell you a
little bit of a story and the first
thing is is there&#39;s this guy named
Michael slaby Michael slaby was the CTO
for the two thousand eight election
campaign for Barack Obama Michael Slaby
is a great guy as you can see he looks
very political operative um you know he
wears a collar and a suit and all that
stuff he&#39;s actually an incredibly smart
guy i know that&#39;s a surprise as well for
political operative I I guess I should
be careful because I get at this point I
am also one but anyway Michael Slaby is
a technologist but he&#39;s a technologist
meaning he knows how to manage
technology he doesn&#39;t actually know how
to build technology and so that&#39;s where
this really incredible person named
Harper Reed came in and so you may
notice there&#39;s a little bit of a
difference between the two of us
specifically I wear hoodies and he
doesn&#39;t wear as many hoodies although
towards the end we got him to but anyway
Michael Slaby as the person who was
finding the CTO for 2012 was kind of
wondering we&#39;re not wondering he had
this mission that it was like we need
someone who knows engineering so my
background as an engineer I built
software I build teams and we execute
and so he was like we need someone like
that and I was explaining this to my
wife and she told me about this Japanese
proverb which is mochi wah mochi ah the
idea that if you want mochi go to the
mochi store or if you want engineering
you got to go to the engineers and so
you know what do you do when you go to
engineers well we build technology and
so we we set out and we were thinking
you know what is the first thing you
build when you have a billion-dollar
business that you start from zero you
have 18 months to do it and so we built
a platform and we called it a narwhal I
just want to take this time to say never
have us name things
we we didn&#39;t really think about how
Narwhal would resonate with the media
and it really did so anyway we built
this this platform and the idea here was
we needed a foundation because the
campaign is such a high intense high
profile thing and you cannot mess up we
could not fail and so what we needed to
do is we need to build this foundation
this infrastructure these roads to build
things on because the bottom line is we
needed to focus on the product and the
product we had many products the
products were things like dashboard or
call tool social our social apps our
mobile apps all of our contributions and
the data the call tool was this really
great application that allowed our
volunteers to to open their mobile
phones open this application and then do
voter contact for us so then we didn&#39;t
have to hire volunteers hires a wrong
word there we didn&#39;t have to interact
with volunteers and get volunteers to
help us dashboard was our online version
of an offline field office this is this
really exciting way so where a person
could come on and they didn&#39;t have any
opportunities to participate maybe
they&#39;re in a rural area may be there in
an urban area like Chicago that isn&#39;t as
important as some of our battleground
states and they&#39;re able to have a very
real participation we had this really
amazing experience where this this
veteran who was in a hospital said hey
I&#39;m able to participate in this campaign
without leaving my bed that&#39;s I never
had that before in software anyway we
also did mobile we did contributions the
data wrapped it all together and that&#39;s
where the platform came into play we had
this platform that made it so when you
log into one tool you were logged into
the others we had all the information
together and we could execute upon it
obviously we won but political
technology is not done we are not done
and like I said in the beginning
politics is still changing so as you do
when you win an election you start
thinking about what&#39;s next and so I&#39;ve
been thinking a lot about 2016 and what
what is going to be important in 2016
and there&#39;s a couple things that I want
to talk to you guys about because I&#39;m
worried about these things I need your
help so the first thing is is we did a
lot of micro targeting we did this thing
that I&#39;m
trying to talk about more which is how
do we use micro targeting the push the
conversation as close as we can to the
voter or to the constituent or to the
volunteer and I call that micro
listening how do we make that
conversation very personal and
individual and you may have seen that in
some of our emails I&#39;m sure you guys got
emails the next one is this is the thing
that I think is new as content becomes
more addressable as we become more
addressable on the Internet I think
there&#39;s going to be a push to be more
efficient in our media buying
specifically that micro media buying you
have this new show house of cards which
i haven&#39;t seen so don&#39;t tell me how it
ends but Netflix just produce this and
you can watch it at any time how awesome
would it be when all of our media is
like that and in 2016 I think more media
is going to be like that which is going
to allow us to address people very
individually this next one is the most
important well maybe voter suppression
is very real it&#39;s happening in the US
today the news talks about it a lot we
happen to use OSHA headey mushahid is
awesome to solve some of these problems
for us and it really made a difference
in Ohio and Virginia we need to use
technology to solve this problem so it
doesn&#39;t affect our elections in the US
and all over the world traditional voter
contact is going to become much much
harder I am 34 I have never mailed
anything I&#39;ve never used a landline and
I really i don&#39;t think i remember the
last time I knocked on a door but that&#39;s
traditional voter contact so how do you
talk to someone not like me but who&#39;s 24
or who&#39;s going to be 18 in the next
election or who moves around a lot these
are things that we&#39;re going to have to
solve and knocking on doors will be
still very important but we need to make
sure that we&#39;re able to contact that
person contact that that that you know
small contingency group that&#39;s moving or
just young people now this is the one
that really scared me so in 2008 both
the McCain and the Obama campaign&#39;s were
hacked by a foreign entity I have no
idea who that was anyway in 2012 I
haven&#39;t seen any articles about this yet
but I&#39;m sure someone could say something
at some
time we were safe and we were safe
because we invested in security but we
went through a lot of tabletop exercises
and game days us trying to figure out
where the hackers could attack us and it
was scary they could have really
disrupted our process they could have
disrupted our program they could have
disrupted the election I don&#39;t think
we&#39;re going to be that safe in the
future there&#39;s hope though I think if
you go back to that idea of mochi wah
mochi ah and you start thinking and
getting people that know what they&#39;re
doing security people you know field
people etc to make sure we&#39;re solving
these problems will be fine thank you
