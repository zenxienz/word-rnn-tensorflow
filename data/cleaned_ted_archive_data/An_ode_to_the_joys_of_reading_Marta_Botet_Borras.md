hi the image okay that was me when I was
nine months old and as you can probably
tell I didn&#39;t even know how to talk and
I was already playing with books they
were just always there for me you know
ever since I can remember I actually
started playing with plastic books to be
read in the bathtub pop-up books books
to be touched books to be smelled books
to be heard even liquid books to be
touched on a screen clearly I&#39;m a reader
I&#39;ve always been and I hope that I
always will be it is actually that
passion for reading that made me create
my blog at the age of 11 I started
blogging well actually but blogging
since my blog was devoted to books and
reading since I love to read but my
friends didn&#39;t I thought that maybe if I
could share what I felt when I read they
could feel the same way
so I start to review my favorite books
imitating TV programs talking about
these books in my living room and
posting them on to YouTube basically
just starting new adventure having lots
of fun and trying to share my passion
and then one day I heard the word book
chipper and so I thought if a book I
found out what a book chipper was and so
I thought if a book chipper is a person
that posts videos onto YouTube talking
about books
then I&#39;m a booktuber we&#39;re book tubers
have been told to be the next generation
and so we use the net to spread our
opinions and we&#39;re trying to turn a
private activity into a social one just
look up on YouTube booktubeathon book to
book textbook challenges book holes
you&#39;ll find so many things and that&#39;s
what we&#39;ve created such an amazing
community and the community is a group
of people that enjoy one same thing and
that one same thing is reading so we can
clearly say that reading is no longer a
private activity now seeing how much
reading has evolved I can&#39;t help but
wonder what will be the next step
how will reading be 20 years from now
well I started thinking about it and
imagine if we could have speed reading
that we could read a book in one minute
or that we could combine a digital book
with a physical book and it had
the features of the digital book but
inside the physical book and that the
pages resembled paper but they were
actually made of some sort of material
that was digital and you could click the
page and it will brighten up in the dark
all those things are amazing but we
don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll happen and that&#39;s
the beauty of the future we don&#39;t whoops
sorry
we don&#39;t know and that&#39;s what I realized
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen but
I am sure of one thing as long as they
are readers willing to devote themselves
to any story the packaging doesn&#39;t
really matter I mean we started from
Brooks and now we have digital screens
who knows where we&#39;ll end up with the
important thing is the story inside the
story that will capture any reader and
make them fly thousands of meters are
gray from the ground and take them to a
place only books can take you to for
instance I&#39;ve been to dystopian futures
schools for wizards of the 17th century
and it&#39;s even brought me here I&#39;m just a
cat Sangha coming all the way from
Barcelona and I&#39;m in New York
participating in a TED youth event with
you so remember don&#39;t forget to read
it&#39;s so much fun thank you
