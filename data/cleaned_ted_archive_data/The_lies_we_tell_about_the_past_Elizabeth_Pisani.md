so I don&#39;t think only about sex for the
last couple of years I&#39;ve mostly been
telling lies I&#39;ve been traveling around
the outer islands of Indonesia I covered
about 42,000 kilometers mostly on cargo
ships and I was I really needed people
to like me because I was mostly going to
places with no hotels so I needed my
fellow passengers to ask me home to stay
now the unemployed happily single
ecstatically childless atheist truth of
me doesn&#39;t go down that well in rural
Indonesia so I made up a long-suffering
husband who was sitting in Jakarta and
had a job at the ministry and when it
came to y know kids I&#39;d raise my eyes to
the Catholic God I don&#39;t believe in and
say you&#39;ll have to ask the Creator and
then from the women I knew keema nasi
will have to sort that out I&#39;ve got a
cousin he&#39;s got a special treatment
three women in our village old ladies
like you they got pregnant after his
special treatment right and from the
guys I get so how many kids does your
husband have with his younger wife and
after about nine months of this daily I
got a bit fed up and one morning I went
into a cafe and the owner was sitting
there and his t-shirt ins plastic
sandals with his mates he calls me over
and I pull out my pack of lies and when
it comes to how many kids I say they
were already grown up and the
conversation moves on I think I&#39;m one
God why didn&#39;t I invent kids months ago
and then the others drift off and the
owner says to me sounds like you&#39;re
interested in politics and he introduces
himself as a local politician he&#39;s doing
a master&#39;s degree at University in
Jakarta his sons getting married in
Jakarta next week Oh it&#39;ll be great come
along I&#39;d love to meet your husband and
you could bring the kids and I&#39;m like
oops and then the following day gets
worse the following day I go in and he&#39;s
a Monday morning he&#39;s suited up for work
he&#39;s reading the local paper and I come
in he waves it at me and he&#39;s like um
look
and there&#39;s a photo of the two of us
sitting there over a story that says
Elizabeth mother of two there lies that
we tell about our past can constrain our
future in in interesting ways and it&#39;s
true of Nations too so in 1965 and 1966
about a million Indonesians were
slaughtered now there were no really
obvious bodies and goodies it wasn&#39;t
like the Nazis versus the Jews or the
apartheid regime versus the black
majority the military were covalent were
killing civilians certainly but we also
had thugs killing plantation organizers
we had Orthodox Muslims killing
synchronous Muslims we had ethnic dye
acts killing ethnic Chinese we had high
caste Hindus killing landless peasants
and we have a lot of personal scores
being settled now the overarching body
the one that permissioned all of these
killings was the right wing of the
military and that was led by the US
backed General Suharto and they won and
Suharto stayed in power for 32 years and
the first thing he did was to create the
National Life and that was that all of
the killing was both heroic and
necessary act of anti-communism that was
going to ensure national survival and
everyone bought it partly out of fear
but largely because it covered up a
multitude of extremely messy since and
then silence
and after Sahara was deposed in 1998 his
first elected successor who was a
religious scholar tried to issue a
national apology to the families of the
victims and he was shouted down by the
members of his own party and every other
party in parliament in Tunisians were
just not ready to give up the fiction
that there was nothing to apologize for
now this has all come to international
attention again recently because of the
documentary that was Oscar nominated
called the act of killing if you haven&#39;t
seen it I urge you to
and that was made free on YouTube in
Indonesia now between 35 and 45 million
Indonesians watch YouTube at least once
a week and about a hundred and thirty
thousands of them have wanted to watch
that movie know why I want to go back to
the admittedly trivial example of the
lies that I told about myself the fact
is they worked I got on perfectly well
with people who may otherwise have been
hostile to me and so it is with the
nation families of the killers and
families of the killed and sometimes
they even in the same family have
actually been able to live perfectly
happily relatively or at least
peacefully for 50 years now the future
is ours this session is called
and we tend to believe that too we tend
to believe that to own the future we
have to own up to our past but I&#39;d like
to advance to you the incredibly
unfashionable and uncomfortable idea
that sometimes the lies we tell about
our past actually buy us time to imagine
a better future thank you
