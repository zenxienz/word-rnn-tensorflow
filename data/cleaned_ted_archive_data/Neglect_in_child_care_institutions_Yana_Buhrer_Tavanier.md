I
I want to warn you that these would be
some disturbing images but they&#39;re over
the year I just want to tell you before
we start that this is going to be a
story about love so meet Katie at this
photo see it&#39;s seven years old and
weighs seven pounds or 3 kilogram that&#39;s
right she&#39;s seven years old Katie
diagnosed with Down syndrome was not
expected to live she has spent her whole
life in a Bulgarian institution for
children with intellectual disabilities
lying a clip on the top floor in the
sector the stuff refers to as
malformation there you can send no hope
in the air just spend a fury and cheeses
this is kaley adage mind at nine Katie
couldn&#39;t talk walk or stand these are
images of a girl left to die I have
spent years investigating and trying to
expose the inhumane conditions in a
magician&#39;s for children and adults with
intellectual disabilities in several
countries and this is what I&#39;ve learned
it&#39;s all about love the total number of
children with intellectual disabilities
in institution in the world is unknown
due to lack of reliable and comparable
data according to one report done by
UNICEF in 2005 only needs in Europe and
the concert from the former Soviet Union
there were more than 300,000 children
with intellectual disabilities living in
residential institutions 300,000 only
this part of the world to take a moment
to think about this
and kaylee it&#39;s not the exception since
rather the rule what we see today even
in developed countries is that
institutions continue to make maintain a
practice of boundaries room of violence
of neglect children are often wrongly
labeled as non recoverable they offered
never leave their best they are not
subject to any relation the kds of this
world often often hundreds of them
stucked in one institution are not being
treated by the insufficient uneducated
stuff they&#39;re simply being stored and
many of them died from malnutrition from
neglect many children died because there
is a lack of care and authorities will
tell you that they are dying because of
their disabilities which is not true and
here&#39;s why meet Katie yes this is the
same girl this year and a half after the
photos you&#39;ve just seen what happened
something that rarely happens for these
children Katie was taken out of the
institution her caretakers would say
that it was because of her disability
that Katie just couldnt crow however
after year and a half at home due to
adequate care from her us adoptive
family Katie&#39;s waste more than tripled
most of her health problems were caused
by servation and neglect and she was
saved by love emotionally Katie was very
damaged from being left alone in a crib
from the time she was born until she was
nearly 10 years old she could not bear
dyrus eye contact
she could not stand being moved touched
or help and would begin to moan and bite
on her wrist in her distress he&#39;s all
very different now she now loves being
lost Katie went from being irritated at
the sight of toys to play with them she
went from being unable to feel love to
really experience in experience in love
she was the kid who could not support
her own health and now she can move
around with minimal support it&#39;s truly
remarkable how quickly human connection
can turn these kids around I want to
make it just a brief note i&#39;m not doing
a manifesto about the benefits of
international adoption I&#39;m just trying
to show what other could care does
whether it comes from adoptive parents
or foster care or devoted caretakers in
small group home adequate quality care
it saves lives and here&#39;s some more
proof meet Lina a big photo she&#39;s six
years old she has no effect and was the
saddest child I&#39;ve ever seen according
to the word of her adoptive mother am
basically and today just 10 months after
the photos of the scene this photo was
taken one month ago she gets tripled her
weight in these 10 month she&#39;s five
inches taller the seventh child is now
the most giggly inhabit I&#39;ll her lack of
ability and the fact word from lack of
stimulation of human contact she was not
able to move she spent six years lying
in her crate on her back and here she is
10 months later sitting all by herself
and being able to spend with help and
these are little sister
a video from the Philippines Adriana
from Taiwan and suffer from Russia all
of which have a similar story they are
all examples of the incredible effects
that adequate care and love has on
children there&#39;s a living breathing and
laughing proof that we need a global
effort to stop the silent genocide of
children with intellectual disabilities
by closing down institutions and
developing alternative types of care in
the community and we need urgently you
can help improve the lives of these
children most of all by trying and
starting to focus on their abilities and
potential and not on their disabilities
don&#39;t discount the uncounted thank you
[Applause]
