when I was younger the sound of my voice
always seemed to catch me of God so I
trained my teeth hard to become
barricade how to keep words out how to
treat speech like an intruder that would
make fool of me in a room filled with
people salad silence stays a sit-in in
my mouth by age four my parents did not
call it mute they called it shy called
me a wind of a boy a breeze that would
pick up conversation eventually that my
whispers were loud enough for them to
hear that a keen ear would know the
music and my tone if they listened hard
enough
I too could teach the ear drums hard to
dance in the second grade my drama
teacher a megaphone loud woman named
Mike Wyatt like archaeologists dug deep
and diagnosed me with selective mutism
proved that my fear of talking was
social anxiety and not attitude
explained that I was so afraid of people
that my vocal cords locked themselves in
that I was not outlier but pioneer like
Maya Angelou who knew quiet like a caged
bird I&#39;d not sing in the wake of trauma
its wings heavy with the weight of grief
this is what we call reactive mutism
when a painful experience suffocates the
throat meanwhile James Earl Jones taught
us that everything the light touches is
our kingdom but as a young boy his in a
lion couldn&#39;t draw this is what we call
functional mutism
to have a stutter like a broken record
so he vowed never to speak again what
eyes the three of us together is not our
silence but our speech how we stumbled
upon poetry like refugees we were the
ones who saw obstacles and thought duck
so what flight so this can&#39;t be the end
the ones who didn&#39;t need subtitles
because our voices were punctuation
marks this is for my ninth grade teacher
who told me that poetry is a daydream
that a Township kid like me could never
afford that I would have to teach my
mouse heart to be a white flag to
surrender like he didn&#39;t take me
to sharpen my mouth so battle slam
poetry taught me how to be a fighter how
to use honesty and sincerity as my
greatest weapons my voice being the only
thing in my arsenal how to use
microphone like warrior had to be
defined with my ambitions how to speak
in the language of dreams how to sing in
audience home like church bells had to
be an asthma pump for everyone who
couldn&#39;t breathe clear the smoke of
struggle this is how I&#39;ve used these
stages as remedy every applaud and
affirmation that my story matters every
snap of the finger a reminder that I am
victory song every time I perform I&#39;m
conquering my greatest fears this is an
ode to the poet I became I still have
selective mutism on most days my voice
has two left feet
cows in the back of the room sits cross
leg and dissect social and justices puts
all potential conversations on voicemail
treats sound like an unwelcome visitor
and then on some days it is able to do
something miraculous something it was
never built for speak speak and speak
thank you
[Applause]
I want to ask you a question to make
sure that the audience understand when
you and I have talked you&#39;ve told me
that when you were young as a child you
could not speak at all at school it was
impossible but when you got home with
your mom you could speak could you
describe just a little bit filling out
about selective mutism just a tiny bit
more okay so basically like selective
mutism is when when a child is like they
socially anxious to a point where it
like they are mute with their when they
in social spaces so for example I&#39;d be
at school and now like my teachers my
friends that I played with had never
heard my voice before but when I went
home my mother was the only person I
spoke to and she knew me she&#39;s like oh
yeah Ally like this is like great like
facial expressions and I talked too much
and my teachers like what well what do
you mean so I think like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
something which is like not like a
highly diagnosed so some people like
misdiagnosed it and they don&#39;t know what
it is so they call it shy or they think
that the child can&#39;t speak but I could
speak four languages by age four so like
it was very weird for them to like not
have heard my voice before so yeah thank
you so much
[Applause]
