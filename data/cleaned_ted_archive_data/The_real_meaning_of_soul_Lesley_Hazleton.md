so what do we really talk about when we
talk about soap we use the word so much
it seems we&#39;d have a handle on it we
talk a beautiful soul lost souls soul
food soul mates and yet somehow the more
we talk the greater the risk of falling
into cliche there&#39;s an easy
sentimentality to the idea of someone
being sold for for instance oh and the
way my Irish mother used to forgive a
rather tiresome acquaintance by saying
but she&#39;s a good soul there&#39;s the pull
letters of Chicken Soup for the Soul
Territory soul is a soft concept be
hard-headed about soul you might as well
try being hard-headed about puppies
because lots of people have tried
nonetheless descartes for instance he of
I think therefore I am
was convinced the soul was a physical
entity and that it was embedded in the
pineal gland which is conveniently
located right in the centre of the brain
and a Massachusetts country doctor once
claimed to have actually weighed the
soul as it left the body at death
three-quarters of an ounce he said but
since that didn&#39;t exactly roll off the
tongue popular legend went instead with
the metric equivalent 21 grams which a
few years back served as the title of a
soul-searching movie in fact our bodies
used to be thought of as souls rather
than the body was incidental and the
soul was all that mattered there wasn&#39;t
a soul in sight someone might say of an
empty lifeless Street and all souls were
lost at sea
a statement that still makes me shiver
along with the emergency call SOS save
our souls the long arm of church
doctrine reached deep even going so far
as to insist that a life lost could be a
soul found
but what are we were to reclaim Seoul
from the lost-and-found business if we
were to free it of pious modifiers such
as blessed and immortal because it
hasn&#39;t always been the exclusive
province of religion back when the
wealthy ate guseva suffer the birds
lungs were called the soul into the
medieval path they were the finest
delicacy and the word is still used with
the sound post of a violin the small peg
hidden right underneath the bridge which
transmits the vibration of the strings
to the body of the instrument the soul
is what allows the violin to resonate to
reach out into the world what then if we
were to reach out to if we were to let
go of that D that very definite article
and quit thinking in terms of the soul
as though it were a thing some interior
component like a sound post if we would
conceive of it instead as a quality of
being
a soul that is not as a possession not
as a part of you that lives on after
death or that could be lost or found or
weighed whether in church or in the lab
in fact not as a part of you at all but
as a dimension of being of existence I
think of this as a an agnostic approach
to soul an existential one if you like
an existentialist what I mean said a way
to open out the idea to give it room to
breathe but then the question is how
exactly approach the sense of soul
directly and likes and it slips through
your fingers ask what&#39;s meant by saying
that someone&#39;s got soul and what comes
to mind or at least what comes to my
mind is that old advertising slogan got
milk soul is something you can get
something that&#39;s good to have of course
you could always call on a whole
checklist of attributes such as
generosity genuineness empathy
compassion or thin
but he saw some kind of Sun almost
reverent not other not vital they are
vital and yet vitality is exactly but
they seem to lack when listed this way
it&#39;s as though they&#39;re weighed down by
earnestness grounded by gravity which
might be why a sense of humor is absent
from that list so what about going with
a different language altogether the
language of music soul music because of
soul can be said to have a heart this
surely goes right to it think Nina
Simone Aretha Franklin
music the voice is deep pain yet somehow
it transforms that pain into beauty by a
kind of alchemy it makes the bitter into
the hauntingly bitter sweet even into
joy and yet couldn&#39;t it be said that all
great music is really soul music music
that moves you that is sometimes
literally so that I might fly myself
dancing to a Beethoven symphony or to
the ecstatic chanting of Nusrat Fateh
Ali Khan because music is not only an
expression of soul
it&#39;s a carrier of it which is why it is
so often banned by fundamentalist
regimes soul does not sit well with
dogma it would be tempting to say here
that fundamentalists are soulless make
that very tempting except is that really
possible only if you still think of soul
as a thing a possession I mean I can see
how a soul could conceivably be owned or
last stolen even sold as an authority
impact but the quality of soul is not a
tradable commodity so it&#39;s not that some
people have no soul but there&#39;s
something in them seems to have
shriveled seems to have turned in on
itself as though in retreat they hunker
down and build a wall around themselves
sometimes even a physical wall of steel
or concrete
afraid of what&#39;s beyond as the unknown
the other they closed the gates and post
guards they live walled off from the
world
even at the extreme against the world
the sort of being against the world
makes me need water the herd thank you
and if the gates were to be kept open
could so be a matter of being brave
enough to be vulnerable to acknowledge
the risks of being vulnerable that is
and willingly accept them nonetheless
because risks they are and those I think
of as brave souls know this in a way
they&#39;re the personification of soul
music
however bitter they&#39;re experienced
they&#39;re not ruled by fear or by
resentment they reach out into the world
instead of being guarded against it
they&#39;re open to it could we think then
in terms of being open soul and closed
soul that sounds promising open and
closed soul and yet there&#39;s still
something missing isn&#39;t that some spark
some sense of energy of life but since
I&#39;m what you might call it a stubborn
soul let me try one last time at least
for now because you know those medieval
diners may have been onto something when
they call the lungs of the goose the
soul the lungs the breath of life and if
the connection isn&#39;t quite there in
English it could be the English just
isn&#39;t a very soulful language uh I was
trying to figure out if I could say that
without laughing I can&#39;t
it does exist in many other places the
sister languages of Arabic in Hebrew for
instance used related words such as
novice and nefesh which can mean either
breath or soul or spirit or all three at
the same time intertwined breath and
soul and spirit and there it is there&#39;s
what&#39;s been missing spirit that sense of
vitality isn&#39;t that what we need when we
talk about soul we need to make it
spirited again give it guts again give
it lungs again because we want to live
life with soul and I think pretty sure
most of us do we need to breathe life
back into it thank you
you
