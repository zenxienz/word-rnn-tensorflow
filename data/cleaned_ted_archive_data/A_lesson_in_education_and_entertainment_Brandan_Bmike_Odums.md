Keamy okay we good enough all right so a
great man once said you have to be the
change you want to see when I was your
age I was taught to bring that quote to
life and that eventually led to the
creation of two cent 8300 students drop
out of school every day now if you ran a
business and you lost 83 custom 8300
customers every day it would be kind of
like a state of emergency you&#39;ll be
trying to figure out okay what do I need
to do to change what I&#39;m doing
add that to the fact that statistically
speaking you students will spend more
time in front of a TV or some type of
screen then you will in front of a
teacher so to address the former we use
the ladder and two-cent basically tries
to create content and an overlap between
education and entertainment during the
break I met a young man he&#39;s gonna come
and help me uh
my man Don say once you come up and help
me man give it up for Dante from Port
Sulphur what&#39;s up man he&#39;s cleaning with
his two cents we&#39;re going so how many oh
honey I got a Twitter Instagram Facebook
you got one of those okay how many
people got at least 500 followers how
many people got a thousand followers oh
how many we got 2,000 followers or no
2000 and up alright so what we think
about what to say is how do we use those
numbers to create influence we try to
think what would dr. King do if he had
access to YouTube or what would Gandhi
do if he had a Twitter or what would
Gordon Parks do if he had an Instagram
Gordon Park said I like to use my camera
as a weapon against those things I don&#39;t
like
so that&#39;s kind of like the mindset of
two-cent when we go and create it&#39;s a
bunch of friends we got together and
said you know what let&#39;s make a
difference does that sound complicated
are we gonna show you example how it
works I got my people here with me Dante
right here so we get together and we are
brainstorm and we try to figure out okay
[Music]
try to figure out okay what can we do to
try to get your attention
what could we create what could we do to
address that something that can go viral
then get a lot of views so here&#39;s an
example of something we did so as we all
know New Orleans teen is back and forth
at the murder capital this country as
well it&#39;s the prison capital of this
country most of those statistics largely
affect young people so we said okay how
can we address this and get young people
to be aware of that and then when we
studied this we got together the brain
foam we study this and we say you know
what they studied fourth grade reading
levels to determine how many prison beds
to build in the future so that shows you
that literacy plays a huge role in
violence so we said okay instead of
trying to target those affected by
violence let&#39;s celebrate and encourage
literacy in education now when I say
this boring so Amanda&#39;s gonna make it a
little bit better and because there&#39;s a
quote Frederick Douglass says it&#39;s easy
to build strong boys they&#39;re broken men
so we
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay so now that you captured the
imagination of your audience we have all
these views and all these comments are
going on about your project you can turn
that attention into influence now some
might think influence is best used to
sell a product a book or album or an
event but what happens when you use that
influence to try to create change or
adjust an issue like we did like like
literacy for example inviting those same
people who watch the video to come out
and volunteer and donate books to a
festival to give books to further
promote literacy join us as we give
10,000 books away or to speak to a
classroom full of students so remember
all this started with that simple spark
of us trying to create change with with
literacy we brainstorm we created the
video we went viral so the platforms are
there I mean all you said you have
Twitter Instagram and what&#39;s other one
YouTube so what are you going to create
what&#39;s your to say how are you going to
create influence and better question
what are you gonna do with that
influence thank you
[Applause]
