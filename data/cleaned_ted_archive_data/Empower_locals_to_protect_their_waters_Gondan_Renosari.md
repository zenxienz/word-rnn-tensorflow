thank you I&#39;m not a marine biologist in
fact i joined marine conservation only
nine years ago at the time the Nature
Conservancy wanted to bring the human
dimension and the governance aspect into
the marine conservation work that we
were doing an Indonesian so before then
I didn&#39;t die I didn&#39;t snort oh I&#39;ve
never been out in the ocean I wasn&#39;t a
source of strong swimmer and I&#39;m still
not a strong swimmer now but don&#39;t tell
my boss that so when i joined the Nature
Conservancy my boss said we&#39;re going to
write the umpire in a few weeks my boss
is sitting there so he told me we&#39;re
going to write down pup in a few weeks
now I was like quickly getting my diving
certificate and then a few weeks later
we went to write down pat my god the
magical of underwater world I fell in
love and then I also saw how the local
people depend very much on the ocean for
their food and for their livelihood so
today I&#39;m going to hear it you a story
about how different group of people from
different backgrounds different
organizations have banded together
working with the local communities to
save this amazing place code right there
unpack and sustain the livelihood of the
local community let me take you to write
down what it is at the heart of an area
called the Coral Triangle an area where
scientists have found more fish and more
coral per unit area than anywhere else
on earth Raja Ampat consists of around
fifteen hundred islands 50,000 people
spread across my knee six villages they
belong to 12 different clans and this
plant has a very strong cultural
connection to the ocean in raja ampat we
can find more than 1500 fish species
more than 600 coral species or about 75%
pieces that are known to many just to
give you a comparison this is about 10
times more that what can be found in the
codeine we have also found more than 40
saltwater lake and some of these lakes
have English jellyfish the other the
only other country you can find these
type of flakes with this English
jellyfish is in Palau and one other
location in Indonesia whales dolphins
all kinds of sharks carpet sharks manta
both Oceanic and Rhys Manta sea turtles
Nick Nick Nick seahorse nudibranch giant
cans all sorts of wonderful creatures
can be found here my god I can&#39;t believe
I know all of that now not only under
the water above the water a jumper is a
spectacular I took my daughter two years
ago to write down pat and as we are
standing on top of this car still
looking down she told me mini can we
keep this place as our secret place
because I don&#39;t want people to ruin it
so I guess this eight-year-old who&#39;s
always been in the city and never been
out in nature within a way smarter than
many of us because then she realized
already how big of an impact that human
half on nature and that it is important
for us to manage it in a second
sustainable way but rather embodies
under threats like many other parts in
the world and one of the ways in which
we can help address this threat is the
established marine protected area in
raja ampat it would consist of zones
load peg films that are allocated for
full protection for tourism and for
research while also allocating some
zones for local fishing for the local
communities to sustain their life issues
however establishing marine protected
area is not as easy as it challenge
especially in our jam pot in the middle
of nowhere with no data and the local
people will really know much
the infected area in the beginning they
were like what we were seeing as
Outsiders literally because this is a
foreign idea that you&#39;re trying to
impose on us so what did we do to
convince the local community that it&#39;s
not a foreign idea after all that making
MPA does make sense we came up with some
local clan leaders some of them that are
more open to the idea we asked them to
be our local champion talking to the
communities spreading the message of
ocean protection we also work with the
priests and local Imams from the mosque
and ask them to insert conservation
message fight some verses of the Bible
and in friday prayers to disseminate
information about ocean protection and
of course the local solution to their
priests much more than they listen to me
and international NGOs we became part of
the community&#39;s daily life we take part
in the village activities we were
flexible just like we&#39;re being flexible
on the ship you know adjusting every day
there were numerous meetings on marine
conservation discussions on ocean
protection in the morning in the middle
of the night on the beach in someone&#39;s
kitchen everywhere else we think it was
possible everywhere else and I&#39;m very
unconventional ways just to get the most
participation out of the community I
actually remember many times thinking
that oh my God my team seems to be
having this discussion all the time on
the white sand beach on the most
beautiful island on earth while I&#39;m
stuck in Jakarta behind the desk
reviewing their reports writing
strategic plan and just to give you an
idea this is the field from our office
there so another important component of
establishing marine protected area is
the science but we didn&#39;t know much
about rajamma so we carried out
scientific data connection
to know where are the locations that are
important to be protected you know how
the fish are doing and to know the
status of other conversation targets
that we need to protect not only that we
also got the information on how people
were using this resources where people
go fishing who were fishing with it
mostly inside or local fishers or was it
outside Fisher we also looked at the
local custom or traditional cultural
values that can be used to promote
marine conservation and in raja ampat we
found that there&#39;s this local custom
called the sassy which includes applying
size limits applying harvest quota
taking turns to harvest and seasonal
closure of their fishing ground and this
is very similar to modern-day fisheries
management we make a point of asking the
woman as well as the women the women of
the village because they&#39;re often
unheard and not included in
decision-making about natural resource
so this is a map the yellow part is the
location that is according to science
need to be protected now these are the
location that belongs to the plan or
their fishing grounds that are important
for them because they do some fishing
there as you can see some of this
location overlap and so there comes a
long process and I mean very long
process of negotiation consultation
bargaining with the community one of the
thing that we found very effective in
negotiating with the community is that
we included the fatty into the formal
rain protected area zoning plan this
seems to be very popular with the
community because they felt like the
custom were included formally
acknowledged formally into the marine
protected area there felt sense of
ownership and I felt empowered because
now they also get to participate in the
management of the fisheries and other
resources
here the red the area colored in red is
the no-take zone so is the orange one
and the yellow is the area for the fafi
or specific plans to fish using only
specific technique because using
sapphira found to be very effective we
know we learn that bringing the science
closer to the people its most powerful
and people participate and when people
understand the reasoning behind it so we
get more community members on board a
business and help us to collect data so
they can see with their own eyes who was
fishing in their waters we also train
the youth to get the more engaged in the
science this year&#39;s restrain this youth
with strength to dive to identify fish
and to help us in assessing the
condition of the reef some of these
views have gone now to study marine
biology and one of them actually join
the government agency that is managing
the marine resource and Fisheries in my
camp at nowadays I feel that there is a
positive mood for conversation in my
jamba in some area we see sharks coming
back in places which we&#39;ve never seen
them there before in some low tech zone
to fish biomass is increasing
community&#39;s perception and support
towards establishing marine protected
area have increased this is a picture
that&#39;s taken in 2012 where there was a
celebration where the traditional
leaders from nine plans provider give
their blessing for the zoning plan and I
was told by one of the elderly their gun
done this is the first time in nearly 50
years all the clans agree unanimously on
one issue so and that was very powerful
so what have we learned with from our
experience establishing marine protected
area in right
but we learn that engaging the community
from the very beginning is key to
promote buying and its key if we want
the NPA to be established effectively we
also learn that science is most powerful
when it&#39;s close to the people and when
people participate in it and when people
can relate to it so remembering my
daughter what she said as we&#39;re standing
on top of wo looking down I am now more
optimistic than ever ever that if you
can work together and get the
communities involved we don&#39;t have to
keep these places as secret and it can
be enjoyed and benefits the future
generation biography
