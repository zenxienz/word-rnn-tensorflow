so zip codes I was having dinner with
some friends about 15 years ago during a
during grad school and for some reason I
started thinking about zip codes and how
they actually work you know I&#39;m sitting
at dinner a lot of fun at parties
sitting at dinner and getting this thing
about like you know the five digit
postal code system that we use in the US
and at the time I&#39;m living in Cambridge
I&#39;ll visit codes there start with zero I
grown up in Michigan everything there
started with four and I just moved from
San Francisco where the zipco started
with a nine and you know starting you
know there might be an actual pattern to
this this is going sort of east to west
and you know genius so I sat down he so
soon after satin I&#39;ve actually started
making a really quick interactive sketch
of just kind of what this looks like so
you know sure enough here all the zeros
the ones the twos and so long and so we
have this regional thing that happens
with the numbering system within the US
and a little more to the point we can
say here 02 we&#39;re now in eastern
Massachusetts one is essentially the
county level three brings us down to the
city and here we are in a Cambridge a
little bit more interesting let&#39;s
actually zoom in and so here we go for
and then one and nine and seven so
here&#39;s epsilon II where I grew up in a
farm or backing out to Ann Arbor the
thriving metropolis nearby all right but
also liked it you know so having done
this we can you actually do the same
thing but just with the names of cities
you know so this is a very simple simple
sketch let&#39;s see maybe we can&#39;t do it
within the age of cities today but
fundamentally what we what we&#39;re trying
to do is
this has been a theme that comes through
in a lot of the work that I&#39;ve done you
know so working as a as a designer I&#39;ve
always been able to take some random
curiosity or something that I&#39;m
interested in or want to work on and
been able to kind of turn that into work
you know so you can kind of reframe
everything based on your particularly
curiosity you know I wanted to learn
about the human genome so I made that
the subjects of my PhD work and really
dug into the the field of genetics and
it brings me to this this quote from
Charles Kingsley Kingsley was a
professor and historian a writer he was
a contemporary you know of Darwin&#39;s they
were sort of pen pals and this idea you
know we act as though comfort and luxury
where the chief requirements of life
when all that we need to make its really
happy is something to be enthusiastic
about and so I think it&#39;s one of the
themes that were going to you know we
see throughout this conference but you
know fundamentally what we&#39;re doing is
trying to take this curiosity and you
know in my case I&#39;m using design as a
weight of digging into something I&#39;m
curious about being able to pull that
apart and explore it and then try and
use it as waved you know teaching
explaining to somebody else what what
that interest is you know the amazing
thing that happened with the zipcode
piece was it you know I hadn&#39;t bothered
putting it online and somebody actually
encouraged me to do it and get thousands
and thousands of people actually going
and playing with zip codes which is you
know kind of bizarre and this is you
know now many years later I wasted a lot
of people&#39;s time so fast forward to you
know present aid you know number of
years later I&#39;ve started a firmware
actually you know working out some of
these ideas and you know brought other
people along this just earning along
with me and so I&#39;m really lucky to have
it you know the experience of working
with a bunch of people who have a
similar view of you know wanting to be
able to pull things apart and understand
data and be able to frame it in
different ways for four people one of
the first projects that we did 2010-2011
we were asked by National Geographic to
do a project about you know the world
population actually hitting seven
billion and so you know how do you
actually frame that you know when you
say something like seven billion people
kind of glaze over with you know
numbers like that and how do you frame
it in some fashion that actually gives
people context about what seven billion
actually means and I&#39;d always been
fascinated by population density and
just how incredibly uneven it is around
the world and you know can we use that
as a way to tell a story about about
population and so what we did was we
took the the typical way you might draw
a map and you know reversed it a little
bit so instead of a large dot
representing a large number of people we
used a large dot to represent a small
number of people and very tiny dobson
represented a very large number of folks
so we&#39;ve got these tiny red dots that
are representing 300,000 and then a
large gray area that&#39;s going to be just
6,000 people and so if we look at
something like India we can see just how
incredibly detailed to get so basically
just gives us a way of you know having
more fidelity and you know more that
kind of catches your eye in that area
that is of most interest but also just
on this on the left-hand side of the
diagram you know see that little orange
pathway that you know kind of shows up
in the middle of nowhere so that&#39;s the
Nile in the Nile River Delta and this
incredible amount of population that you
have around that even though there&#39;s the
land on either side and so you know
these types of things start emerging out
of the data which make it really fun you
know here&#39;s what North America looks
like you know come very different you
know type of picture a much you know
larger project that we worked on we were
talking to thomson reuters who asked us
to do a project about China in
particular the leadership transition you
know they have a once-in-a-decade
handover of you know who&#39;s running the
the Communist Party and you know in
spite of China being the fastest growing
economy and one of the largest countries
on earth we know next to nothing about
it and so we started building this html5
based web app + iPad app that you know
starts unpacking some of these ideas as
a team of journalists who gathered all
this information about how you know the
different hue chua lee is running china
so in this case we&#39;re looking at the
social view where we can see the
connections between different people
we&#39;re trying to frame the idea of how
social power begins with family in this
case and understanding how those those
family ties can lead to later influences
here&#39;s now President Xi Jinping and his
you know first degree of his social
network and then to the right there the
the second degree and then we can take
things like those softer social ties and
contrast that with this institutional
view where we have the seven members of
the Politburo Standing Committee and
being able to see their roles within the
party in the military and government so
they have the number of different roles
so here&#39;s you know technically what&#39;s
happening on paper that the hierarch you
know structured of things but we&#39;re just
being blue juxtapose that with these
softer you know social ties in terms of
how you know humans actually interact
with one another and you can go really
deep on this so you know given a
particular area kind of seeing more of
the background about what what role
beach each of these tapes and then it&#39;s
all cross-referenced across the the rest
of the application then finally we can
do things like you here where we&#39;re
doing a comparison of different of
different people&#39;s careers so that
within Chinese politics that there&#39;s a
very specific you know past that you
take you know going from being a
provincial deputy than the Chiefs and
then moving up to something more
national and so we can literally plot
the arc of different people&#39;s careers
and you know just how significant you
know and who are the up and comers and
things like that and then we also have
just you know some of what Reuters is
more typically known for in terms of
longer form journalism and be able to do
some more in-depth reporting about the
topics in China but also you know
cross-referencing not against the actual
application itself so you know and then
what goes behind this is you know we do
a lot of sketches like this so that the
data it&#39;s about a one and a half million
words that actually goes into the final
application
tens of thousands of connection this is
just a few a few hundred or even maybe a
few thousand connections and we&#39;re
trying to map out here just how much
detail do we actually need on that on
that social view that to understand how
people are connected to one another and
so we never want to put that sort of
diagram in front of people and so
instead it evolved through some
back-and-forth with design and
development to something here where it&#39;s
a little bit more structured and then
finally what you know winds up in that
the actual final version so encourage
you to check it out so it&#39;s just a free
online site it&#39;s connected China traders
com runs on browser runs on a tablet
lots of fun and you know just a really
amazing resource the last project I
wanted to talk about was looking at
activity tracking so we&#39;ve done some
work with nike most recently looking at
their their FuelBand so this activity
monitor that&#39;s been you know becoming
sort of a an interest as far as the
quantified self thing but with the field
on what we&#39;re doing is taking minute by
minute data and be able to say how much
activity or how active is somebody over
the course of the day so we have 1440
data points with pom you know in one
24-hour period and then imagine what
that looks like a cross you know
somebody&#39;s entire history so you know
days or different than weekends imagine
what that looks like across millions and
millions of records be able to do that
globally be able to see different
changes in terms of how people are how
were you know we&#39;re incredibly similar
and we&#39;re also incredibly different and
is this really fascinating data set and
the one you know one example of
something that we did with that was here
where we just wanted to make a poster of
you know what is your year of activity
look like so you know here&#39;s the 2013
activity for in this case this is our
contact at Nike and moving left to right
we&#39;ve got three a.m. to three a.m. and
we&#39;ve just taken those plots and you
know superimpose them over one another
and what we see on the vertical axis is
just how much activity on you
actually have and be able to see some of
that variation and what we wanted to do
is just create a poster that you know it
looks interesting but it&#39;s also true to
your data but it feels real in terms of
how you actually go through your your
day so in her case she&#39;s very good about
actually getting a decent run in the you
know sometime between six and nine that
sort of large blue area there and then
you know the rest of the day is a little
bit a little bit less even been doing a
lot of travel and such on the other hand
this is so many in our Studios James who
bikes to work so we extremely structured
with you know gets up bikes in I almost
always goes for a walk to to get lunch
and then bikes back in the evening is a
evening hours departing being a little
more regular perhaps stuck doing nike
work the and then here&#39;s 20 total you
know so here&#39;s somebody who&#39;s a
marathoner and triathlon ER and like how
intense is this and so that they&#39;re just
getting in you know hours of activity
and you know has a just a completely
different visual signature and here&#39;s um
here&#39;s your humble speaker who is not a
triathlon trainer and is incredibly
regular about his days apparently
although i have a new daughter and so we
have these extra spikes happening in the
middle of the night but the thing that
we&#39;re going after here is really just
this you know the uniqueness of all
these different individuals and how you
know wanting to have this sort of
profile that you know looks true to you
but has you know it actually has this
wonderful sort of variation to it and be
able to express that for people and so
closing up that the for the last couple
years I&#39;ve been running this company and
I tend to be somebody who gets kind of
you know worn out with the day-to-day in
a bit you know bit of the grind and
doing things like you know understanding
the tax implications of sending a
profit-sharing for a 401k plan is not
really like pulling apart data and you
know doing interesting things with it
and what I really want to be doing is
making things and having ways to work
with
people who are making things as well and
as i mentioned i have a newborn who she
showed up in october and so he or she is
and the the amazing thing here is you
know so she&#39;s at this age where
everything is incredible like everything
is something to be enthusiastic about
and so Oh what I&#39;ve done is actually
made this my my lock screen on the phone
and uh excuse me pardon I didn&#39;t do this
while practicing that&#39;s weird miss my
daughter and my wife um anyhow odd but
you know to her anything that she sees
is so incredible and so I so exciting
that it&#39;s this really wonderful image of
you know just exactly that but it&#39;s all
we really need is something to be
enthusiastic about thanks very much
[Applause]
