hello everybody I&#39;m still living a
little bit in Crystal bunnies moment
actually I kind of wanted to go online
and see can I find that video crying
that video um my name is Benna van gogh
at a nominal and I&#39;m a writer and
although somehow this this piece how to
write out about Africa which became spam
in fact it was annoying me to boo kept
sending it to me telling me have you
ready thing you should see the stuff
that I&#39;ve spent more time on is more
it&#39;s different now
I just kind of you know I think it&#39;s a
strange thing that we&#39;ve kind of been
circling around the same ground this
whole this whole conference and coming
back again to the ideal story and how
its central to things I was going to
start off this talk so many ways one of
the ones of things I wanted to say was
but the biggest that the most consumed
stories on this continent are from the
Bible in almost every manner of language
you can imagine I think that it&#39;s
translated I think into 600 languages
and that&#39;s what people consume a
religious idea and take anything else
but it occurred to me that the Bible
works because it&#39;s stories and the
people are able to make sense of
something with reference to stories in
the Bible and I guess it&#39;s a test to
some degree or what written literature
has not yet done that we haven&#39;t yet
gone find in challenging the Bible by
offering other options much as the Bible
itself may be a good one
I just want to read something I wrote
briefly there are so many possibilities
that could overturn this journey yet I
cannot leave without being certain that
I will get to my destination if there&#39;s
a miracle in the idea of life it is this
that we are able to exist for a time in
defiance of care
later you often forget how I say
everything was how the tickets almost
didn&#39;t materialize how the event almost
got postponed how a hangover nearly made
you miss the flight
phrases well becoming bigger than their
context and speak to us as truth we
willed this series of events as our do
the standards of standard of gifts 4
gifts of the future we live the rest of
our lives the utter knowledge that there
is something deliberate that transports
everything into place if we follow the
stepping stones of certainty we&#39;re not
about 12 or 13 locked as usual in large
parts of my day where I&#39;m inside a book
somewhere and I&#39;m in trouble with my
mother so I&#39;m hiding in the toilet or in
the bathroom oh-hoh with a torturer with
a candle everywhere all of a sudden was
these stories about these dogs called t9
and I&#39;m sorry tanzanian but seems like
these t9 dogs were coming from Tanzania
in fact it turns out that near a the
president of Tanzania for various
obscure reasons decided to have these
Robo dogs which were sometimes Robo dogs
which were a bit or Robo dogs which were
robots and they these Robo dogs were all
over the country now this wasn&#39;t you had
different kinds of rumors the people who
were less educated than people who have
different ways of telling stories but
this particular one was interesting
because kids in primary school were
telling it rich snooty people were
telling it doctors were telling there
was just this story and so the
perception was you don&#39;t leave home and
in fact recently I travel to certain
rural areas we have people I like you
know people used to go out at night a
lot in this place but this is 30 19 20
years ago we don&#39;t go out much at night
now for a long time you know after I&#39;ve
been trying to figure out because at the
same time there was kind of comment
aware because gossip is always juicy so
someone who doesn&#39;t believe in
superstitious things would tell the
story and then afterwards you&#39;d
intellectually analyze it to persuade
everybody that you don&#39;t really believe
it and you&#39;d be saying
well these rumors were being spread by
the police so we don&#39;t go out so they
can do the things that they do possibly
all these rumors were coming because of
this now you fast forward again and I&#39;m
on the street or Nairobi and the some
guy standing there and he&#39;s doing
mathematical formulas in chalk by the
bus station and the people standing
there watching it and he&#39;s trying to
explain it and the Bible is coming into
it somehow or other and I don&#39;t
understand anything he&#39;s saying and I&#39;m
tempted to say he&#39;s mad but this
mathematics going on on the thing and I
have no idea what&#39;s going on there and
then I go somewhere else in the city and
then there&#39;s a guy with a little gizmo
which is cutting potato peels and
carrots and things and the group of
people around him and he&#39;s saying how
you can make healthy life and is
pounding juices and organics etc
meantime suddenly all over the city it
seems people are going back to eating
traditional vegetables people who turn
their back on they&#39;re all back and all
kinds of health foods from weird a
pyramid scheme aloe vera from America to
everything else everybody what&#39;s going
on and everybody&#39;s talking about them
and everybody is talking about germs in
the air and problems and troubles and
everything else and suddenly people
aren&#39;t eating chips for lunch in Nairobi
relating fruit salads did that happen
all the men are saying put a little bit
of violent herbs into soup so that it
becomes more healthy boil it don&#39;t fry
it where is this coming from people
alike cleanliness cleanliness by martini
soap on the road where is this coming
from and decided to occur to me that
sense data we had the data I mean the
whole time we knew ok this is our
president this is our government is what
he&#39;s doing
yes this is an X billion of dollars
which somehow disappeared because we&#39;re
trying to export gold but that was
useless
because now you know a little bit better
and now I can see closer and clearer in
terms what state house was now that
actually you are seeing the stories in
every pen people are saying this is what
the president was saying to that person
that day it still doesn&#39;t make sense
because the President to start off with
was about as confused as we were and
really the way you start to make sense
is that the reason that there was a
thing called t9 is because people
perceive the threats that they could not
name because this was the season that
friends that you knew were being picked
up in disappearing this was the season
that politicians were coming up and
saying dissidents dissidents and anybody
seems to be able to become a dissident
these are the seasons of you know
sources of anything and so really the
clearest way to describe what reality
was were those crazy Robo dogs and the
effect of it was simply take care of
your children don&#39;t go out I don&#39;t
placing was sensible but at the time
that you&#39;re opening a newspaper and
seeing yourself starving at the time
when everybody is telling you you are
the worst aids country in the world of a
second worse and then your politics is
horrible and they&#39;re like will they will
they go into civil war like Rwanda and
everything else
why spontaneously do people have an
obsession with cleanliness and buying
organic food on the street because this
is how society moves and you know as
such in so many little sessions where
people talk about Oh raising awareness
and telling our own stories and then
somebody goes and puts together a story
where they&#39;re like this when so left
Senegal to get on a boat for 27 weeks
where he&#39;s hanging upside down and then
he thinks when his friends think and he
did that because he was desperate and
I&#39;m like that is about the most useless
information you&#39;ve provided me
I can do nothing with this and nobody
can do anything with it so like this I&#39;m
starting to say that actually sorry
people it starts here with the job as
guys as writers are doing cause we&#39;re
also trying to make sense of this London
and it&#39;s a weird thing that I think it&#39;s
even a challenge to some of us writers
that very much the stories that have
been circulating have been ahead of us a
little small water I was here about a
few months before the 2002 election that
we all kind of jittery and the President
had said he was going to leave and we
kind of really didn&#39;t believe it but
well he had said and it was looking like
it was going to happen and so I think
was saying but what about all those
people around him what&#39;s going to happen
so this guy tells this story no idea if
it&#39;s a tall tale let&#39;s call it and he
was like well you know I had the
bodyguard on Saturday so so you know the
guy that the guy was six foot something
in Sangala Suzumiya so what has been
doing basically is that when they&#39;re
walking in that corridors of status and
the president is asleep they keep
opening the door and then they take
turns and then they stand near him when
he&#39;s sleeping is that saying I would you
feel safe with would you feel safe with
would you feel safe with okay do you
feel this now would you feel safe with
could you sleep so here here it was and
we knew he was above the law and we knew
that the deal that it was that if he was
going to go away he would not be charged
for anything but it wasn&#39;t clear what
was going to happen to anybody else so
there you have it there in that bar just
that little piece of Lister that&#39;s
making sense of it and I&#39;ve given you
something to carry away to make sense of
something that&#39;s actually not sensible
now I kind of want to move to a second
four-part and break a head rule because
you know really I&#39;m in the business of
writing and so I couldn&#39;t find right
pictures now and they gave me a little
itty-bitty thing magic which I have
probably lost
oh they thought this one yes
and it&#39;s come up magically without me
doing anything now last year actually
two years ago in London I was walking by
the South Bank it was one of the three
warm days in a year in London and I
picked up this book called such sweet
country by Kajol I&#39;m a very annoyed when
I saw it because I&#39;m like oh how come I
didn&#39;t know about this book I am proud
that way at least about people from my
continent to write and since that time
I&#39;ve read this book nine times and to my
mind is really the finest novel I&#39;ve
read that came out to the continent and
you know that&#39;s all telling because
there&#39;s amazing novels on this continent
and more than anything is kind of what
he set out to do this poet trying to
write prose and saying oh this is what I
assumed he says oh I want to make a
literary map of Accra I mapped when you
read it you&#39;ll be carrying a crowd with
you the whole city yeah okay I&#39;m going
to do it so I just want to read some
extracts of this great book for you
first a little bit of snippets titled
kind of tongue-in-cheek themes on this
on diminishing returns close lines of
Accra unite for all your washing ropes
were higher than Mama&#39;s great great head
of Dooku this April morning with a cloud
still undecided
she took her certainty along by stooping
under everything stooping under her own
history of the head and heart stooping
under the stairs in mum Probie and
stooping her under her own lowering
world on Doudna dependents there was
above the food he ate and drank other
people&#39;s goodness standing near the pins
gates cool running the pins two dogs in
different directions with his limp in
between forever one half of the world
was always lower than the other so that
his limp almost became a moral force
when he misbehaved he defined the world
as the lower half and when he was good
he could hardly reach the higher half of
his limp his real world of value
I&#39;m going to read a bit of another
section of the same I&#39;m going to ask you
just because I think it&#39;s just how you
let your senses involve yourself in this
I&#39;m going to ask you to close your eyes
now let you see I have no hand-eye
coordination doesn&#39;t exist even
arranging pages is a problem you see
page 3 page 4 right ok there we go
ok close your eyes on markets and nation
now my college is a class largest market
the war is on we&#39;ll match against at Sam
pong Kwok would do I had already left in
his paws room 504 and coffee Kobe was
moving off in that smile that carried so
much confusion he fell too long in body
to Martin dance but he felt excitement
the excitement he could not join so he
smiled his way out missing a co-op
piercingly though he knew she would be
angry with his lateness a cloud and a
hope had covered the Sun and then
released it again
Benny Badu had got a drum from somewhere
and manager at jamming a whistle with
the rear the four star words moved down
the streets of Medina as if there were
20 also for science kept shutting an
opening and as they went along some
during them some laughed at them the
afternoon had rushed into the dusk as
the crowd grew so that they had to
breathe outside the day breathing from
yesterday&#39;s deposit of darkness one gift
of whistling from a demon&#39;s mouth
pretends of additional dancers and new
hands waving they could wave in without
whole world but don&#39;t forget the faces
covered by the waving hands those faces
would push through the fresh flesh in
the African void they too wanted to see
history that ran past them and the air
was swollen for not all the people could
fit into it
one
leg of the crowd was also for the other
leg was Akron sir name and first name
both something - it so that bits of
ground on paper rules heads hearts and
heels rules after the air finally burst
though arguments about who should brief
what was left I went to this bit so take
your head and go there is the same as
the earth they are plots in it I have
six plots you can&#39;t bring that big news
of yours in my air as for me I&#39;ve
already put up a don&#39;t be fine in Ghana
the air must have always have something
in it we feel any type of absence with
any type of presence so I intend to fill
my air with hundreds of kerclaw flowered
fried plantain for sale now the
universities the universe lowered the
sky joins them the clouds bursting in
among them with a bit brought up with a
broad promise of rain the key to the
crowd lay asleep in a sofas cassock
pocket and no one wanted to be opened no
not to be shut when they reach the
airport Junction the police thought it
was a grand picnic so they stand the
crowd on either with their own dancing
or that indifference also for drag the
junction along for a few yards of prayer
and in front of Flagstaff house he tore
a quarter of his cassock off sticking a
sudden stick through it and screaming
the flag we have our flag
ours are for banner with Jesus behind it
there was a row of the crowd saw him and
moved on surging like a dry sea roaring
in human form more drums had joined so
that the different centres of sound
deepened around the spreading movement
and all around the electric passion of
one man also for Akron whose huge hands
tied the crowd splayed and trips the
four dancers manager a German had long
ago given up trying to create little
squares of order and elegance amongst
the acres of fury then the old catechist
who will soften his cassock was more or
less his skin screamed out in the
fattest
of voices one whole country cannot fit
under a soldier&#39;s cap god help us push
them all out the old man&#39;s cry became a
song then it became a burden as they
carried its meaning and certainly along
then at last it became a weapon they
would attack the center of a crowd with
the power of prayer and the song also
for knew how to put a smile above the
higher
is of tension the suspicious sky was
beautiful now with the beads of a double
rainbow
thousands of women&#39;s waist in the sky
then there was the chanting by the
purposeless power by the case keys of
days power by the Cutlass days power by
the sardine days power by the Tama there
is there is what there is bottom power
somebody shouted that the whole of Accra
was in a sack and that they would pound
it to death just as they used to pound
cuts to eat Ghana was a photocopy
country and they wanted the original
truth you can open your eyes now so what
I&#39;m saying is when we are trying to look
for these tubes to put food in people&#39;s
mouths and I don&#39;t know all this thing
and to eradicate or make awareness for
those young people not to enter the boat
and all of this thing I think the fact
that thirty years down thirty years down
the line and forty years down the line
that we can&#39;t make that it is easier for
an African writer to go and do a reading
in London than to cross this border to
Uganda is a problem and that the only
space that we&#39;ve got to share the quiet
intimacies of who is who that for me to
hear the friends of mine who come from
different tribes and are married start
being threatened by each other when
politics get hot because they&#39;ve never
shared in a novel where the person you
love and are married to where you can go
inside the space that they are speaking
in their language and intimate and then
not be threatened anymore it is that it
is our society&#39;s opened their hearts to
each other it&#39;s in those stories and
very often when the trouble starts it&#39;s
because the imagination has failed to
make a good story work thank you
