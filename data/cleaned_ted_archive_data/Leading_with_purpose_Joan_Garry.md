so Oh
so when Irish lesbian walks into a
shrinks office help me
I&#39;ve I&#39;ve always loved taking care of
people it&#39;s what I do it&#39;s why I left
corporate America to go find a rewarding
job and I just got hired to run a large
gay rights organization I&#39;m their new
executive director but now I feel like
I&#39;m I&#39;m gonna have to take care of every
single gay person in America those of
you who work with and for nonprofits you
get this right feels like every decision
matters at least it did to this Irish
lesbian on that particular day nonprofit
life is intense this was driven home for
me one afternoon at a board meeting in
Chicago I&#39;ve been driving my staff
pretty hard especially my development
director Julie revenue numbers seemed
aggressive so in walks Julie and I
noticed that she&#39;s got these wires
protruding from her blouse she said oh
don&#39;t worry Joan it&#39;s just a heart
monitor it&#39;s just a heart monitor I&#39;m
having a few heart issues but it&#39;s no
big deal what do you think happened I
sent her home put her right back on that
next flight to LA no I did absolutely
nothing Julie stayed it&#39;s actually a
great board meeting
but Wow I&#39;ve started to refer to what
happened that day as the time I almost
killed my development director now Julie
was fine thankfully but I became very
conscious that my leadership style was
making people sick
literally nonprofit life is intense let
me think about it when you&#39;re trying to
save even a small part of the world
there&#39;s just no margin for error a
father and his toddler will sleep on a
subway if you don&#39;t get the check to the
landlord on time if you run a legal aid
organization and a battered wife will
have no escape
if the women&#39;s center in your community
has no money to market because she won&#39;t
even know it exists
nonprofit life is intense in fact during
my tenure as the executive director at
GLAAD my staff measured my intensity
level using a Starbucks metaphor
have you seen Joan today Oh be careful
she&#39;s a venti but after the Julie
incident I really woke up and I learned
three valuable lessons I&#39;d really like
to share with you because I think and I
hope that these lessons will make the
work lives of all of you whether you
wear regardless of where you work
just a bit less intense so number one
focus on what actually matters the tough
one for my clients so it&#39;s your annual
gala you can obsess about the
centerpiece on the table or you could
sit down at that table and listen to the
major donor who&#39;s been your champion for
over twenty years
you know in nonprofits you will always
be handed too many balls to juggle the
object of the game is not to drop not to
keep all the balls in the air the goal
is to make sure that you make
intentional choices about which falls to
drop there are things that have to
happen there are some things that would
be great to happen the key is
understanding the difference so lesson
one prioritize number two be a real
person so after that Julie board meeting
there&#39;s another board meeting and our
director of IT Aysen Abel is giving a
rather dry PowerPoint presentation board
heads are starting to nod when all of a
sudden out of the blue this slide
appears please say hello to asons
beloved poodles
that&#39;s Peyton Harry and William so after
the board members stopped laughing
something happened more focus we got
more done and by the way after that I
started encouraging pets to appear in
all of our board presentations so lesson
two have fun number three finally be a
champion of purpose so I&#39;m working with
this client they have a legal aid
services arm and they&#39;ve been having
some admin snafus one of them was an
admin who left a check on a copy machine
and a landlord didn&#39;t get the rent check
I knew immediately what the problem was
that admin saw that check as a piece of
paper and not as a roof over somebody&#39;s
head
if he had seen and pictured a father and
a toddler on a subway where do you think
that check would have gone research
tells us that people who drive meaning
and significance out of their work are
more than three times as likely to stay
engaged and stay put and so to my fellow
nonprofit warriors we are wearing the
ruby slippers because in our line of
work it&#39;s all about purpose our board
our staffs they need to see feel and
understand the importance of the work
that we do all the time all the time and
by the way the next time you&#39;re thinking
about taking a donor to house in court
take the admin instead lesson three
purpose so once upon a time I was a
venti I thought nothing of having a
staff member come in to a board meeting
wearing a heart monitor but now I get it
I understand that while nonprofit life
is intense it&#39;s the really fine leader
that triggers out a way to manage that
intensity to enable the entire team to
maintain clear perspective because it&#39;s
only with clear perspective that you all
will do your very best work and that&#39;s
the quality of work that your clients
need and the quality of work your
clients deserve thank you
