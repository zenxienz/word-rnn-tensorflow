Thank You minute
did I guess the first question is how do
you explain what to do when you meet
somebody at a party it&#39;s a good question
and I&#39;ve been in this business a long
time so about 20 years ago when I
started and said I was working in
sovereign advisory people assume that I
was advising the Queen but I think today
it&#39;s more in the popular discourse
particularly what&#39;s going on in Europe
and I think they understand more and
more that governments take on financial
advisors in difficult times and even
friends and family who have nothing to
do with finance or now asking me about
haircuts and Greece and you know the
holdouts in Argentina so it&#39;s definitely
changing let&#39;s type of high definition
sovereign debt what does it mean exactly
sure they&#39;re different categories of the
diet and the first part is the direct
debt of the sovereign so that&#39;s the
Treasury bills and bonds that a
government contracts there&#39;s also the
debt that the government will guarantee
so it&#39;s corporations in its private
sector and the government is guaranteed
that debt then there&#39;s also a broader
definition of the public sector so any
state owned corporation and its debt and
then lastly not a direct debt of the
country but it&#39;s the contingent
liabilities which we saw in the recent
crisis is very important the too big to
fail those institutions in a country
where a government will step in if I
have problems that many people do your
job but this seems to be kind of a
growing field it&#39;s true again back in
the day there are very very few teams
who did this and we all know each other
and we&#39;ve worked on similar situations
or the same cases on different sides of
the table but increasingly there&#39;s a lot
of technical assistance provided by the
IMF and the World Bank and other
multilateral institutions also other
governments will send technical
assistance there are a lot of economics
professors
out there giving advice and as well as
investment banks they look at this is an
interesting business but we
fundamentally give advice in a different
way so if there are banks and firms and
others building up teams for this means
that they are seeing potential new
customers does that mean that there is
more beyond more trouble behind at the
lines that we see I think what&#39;s
changing today is the nature of the
government&#39;s getting into trouble if we
look back over the past decades it&#39;s
mainly been a problem of the emerging
markets so we had the Latin American
debt crisis asian debt crisis the
unsustainable debt levels in sub-saharan
Africa but today at least from the
European perspective I think we see the
problem getting a little bit closer to
home with problems in the eurozone so as
less from premier perspective and if you
are freedom to talk about it run us
through how it works from when you get
to them phone call from a government
sure usually we working directly with
the Ministry of Finance and given the
nature of the problem it&#39;s handled at
the various highest levels of government
so we&#39;re working directly with the
minister and his or her team and it&#39;s
natural that in the Ministry of Finance
there&#39;s not necessarily the direct
experience or expertise on handle how to
handle such a crisis because they only
come along once in a generation so I
think they they see the point of having
a financial advisor come in that&#39;s seen
it all before there are each cases of
course unique but there are patterns and
there are similarities and we can bring
that expertise to them so you analyze
the situation you give advice on on the
choices you help creditors prepare
different lenders prepare the eventual
negotiations now one thing that we all
wonder is why can&#39;t lender spot the
trouble ahead of time you know isn&#39;t
there rewarding science and these kind
of things well they should be able to
give theory and its many people&#39;s jobs
to do just that
to analyze the data of a country and to
assign risk to them so the international
rating agencies will look at a country&#39;s
financial health and and give them a
risk category whether that&#39;s the coveted
triple-a all the way down to junk
lenders of course are also looking to
see what is the risk of getting their
money back and so they too are assigning
a risk to that and needing a certain
return on for taking that risk now with
any human endeavor there are mistakes
and and people miss things and
situations change you actually sit in on
negotiations yes typically yes we
accompany the minister or the head of
the delegation but we&#39;re there to
support them they&#39;re the ones leading
the negotiation so inevitably if you
have them shape their negotiation
strategy or give them advice you will
push them to take some radical decisions
or radical positions so negotiations I
assume can get tense how defuse that
well two things first of all I&#39;m not
pushing for any one particular agenda my
job is to support them so I will analyze
what&#39;s happening and try to help the
team in the government understand the
consequences of various actions but of
course there are other factors at play
not just financial so the government&#39;s
will make decisions of course on their
own but having said that yes tensions
can run very high in these negotiations
lenders want their money back
governments is particular in crisis one
to protect their resources and so
tensions can become high and if we look
back at again at one of the early debt
negotiations back in nineteen ninety
when Mexico was having their
negotiations and they took one look at
what the creditors were offering and
they stormed out of the room board in an
aeroplane and went back to Mexico
it was great diplomacy on the US and
other creditor countries to get them
back to the table and they got a better
deal that they would have gone otherwise
if I remember correctly well maybe maybe
starting out a little bit a good
strategy sometimes it&#39;s a risky strategy
but sometimes it can pay off I&#39;m sure
every case is different as i said but
other patterns on how governments run
into trouble yes i mean basically a debt
you can manage your debt if it is a long
tenor if it has a low interest rate if
it&#39;s contracted in your own currency
under your own laws and you have a
robust economy usually then things can
go along you can sustain your debt what
goes wrong is when suddenly you&#39;ve
contracted that the shorter tenor so
it&#39;s do quite quickly at a higher
interest rate because you&#39;re a risk your
country you&#39;ve contracted it in someone
else&#39;s currency under someone else&#39;s
laws and then you&#39;re very vulnerable so
if your economy is hit by either an
internal shock or an external shock
you&#39;re suddenly left very vulnerable so
what you&#39;re saying is that somehow if
you are in control of the currency by
which the debt is contracted and it is
your currency you can actually print
your way out of a crisis sometimes it&#39;s
not generally recommended there are side
effects too yes I mean you&#39;d have
runaway inflation in your central bank
but yes in theory it&#39;s easier if it is
in your own country under your own laws
when we look at these negotiations from
the outside it looks a bit like sorry
for the world but a bit of a murky
business you know Goldman Sachs is
actual is actually known as public
information for having helped previous
we governments to adjust a bit the the
books so that
would look look better now and not
asking you to comment on that specific
case but our government books in general
close to reality or closer to creative
accounting well there as in many fields
I mean in accounting there are
legitimate ways that they can present
their numbers in a better light and
those of course are like I say
legitimate and they&#39;re going to try to
use them to their advantage there are
also as you alluded to derivative
products where you can repackage the
debt to get it off the sovereigns
balance sheet that also can happen and
then some countries lie they just
exaggerate and they try to fool the
crowd for as long as they can and then
often some governments just don&#39;t have
the ability to collect the data in an
accurate and timely way and again
there&#39;s a lot of increasing technical
assistance to governments to help them
in that process what was exactly
restructuring that in terms of public
finances meaning how different is it
from me refinancing my mortgage I mean a
lot of the money that has gone to bail
out Greece actually just went through
Greece and straight back to creditors so
it&#39;s not very different from my
perspective of me just getting a new
mortgage to refinance my old one right
well in any profession we have our lingo
so when we say debt restructuring we&#39;re
implying that there is an actual
reduction in the principal amount of
debt so if I out a hundred I now I&#39;m
going to owe a tea and so that&#39;s what we
call the haircut of the debt so that&#39;s
to demystify those those words and then
when we say a debt reprofiling we&#39;re
suggesting that we&#39;re actually
stretching out the mature maturities so
if it was doing 2015 it can then just be
due in twenty twenty or twenty
twenty-five sometimes but not always
accompanied with the lowering of the
interest rate so we&#39;re just that&#39;s that
kicking the can down the road then we
have refinancing or rollover of the debt
and that&#39;s
assuming that you have still good
relations with either your existing
creditors or with new creditors who are
going to lend you new money to pay off
the old debt now some of these
techniques might be available to us in
our mortgages others and for absolutely
not so but an impersonal is something
that gets lost in particular the news
coverage of that and it is the absolute
figures are important but somehow that
is relative is relative to your capacity
to service it as long as you can service
it somehow it remains what was
sustainable yeah exactly if you can
service the debt and you can pay the
interest that&#39;s coming due and you can
have access to the market and you can
refinance the the maturities that are
following you then it&#39;s sustainable it&#39;s
only becomes a problem as we said when
you&#39;re facing kind of imminent default
and your options are limited because
it&#39;s in the news what&#39;s your ear
assessment how sustainable is a Greek
debt now it&#39;s a good question if we take
that yardstick its sustainable right now
in the sense they&#39;re not facing imminent
default if we look back at twenty ten
and twenty eleven their options when
they were in the eurozone and they
wanted to stay in the eurozone and so
and at that time the other countries of
the eurozone thought that a default or
restructuring of the debt was going to
be a well detrimental to the other
members and to the Euro itself and so
they decided as a block that they were
going to lend to Greece in order for
Greece to pay its private creditors and
that&#39;s how the debt transformed from a
private sector debt into a state to the
European institutions but the the
European institutions have
in those bailouts the earlier bailouts
they have structured it so that the
interest payments are not falling due
immediately in fact those are deferred
and capitalized and there&#39;s not interest
due on those early bailouts until 20 23
on the current bailout that just
happened in August what we call the
third program there is interest coming
due but principal in that case is not
due for 15 years until after the program
so 2032 so in a sense there is time now
there is some breathing space the debt
is there no one denies it but they do
have the space and time to do the
structural of reforms that are really
needed to get the economy going we&#39;ll be
watching Jill thank you for coming to
Ted thank you thank you thank you
