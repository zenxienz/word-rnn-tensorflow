I grew up when I was 12 years old my
friends were busy experimenting with
electric blue eyeshadow and root beer
flavored lip smackers swooning over that
new greasy haired boy and so was I that
was until I got dropped kicked by a word
with more syllables in the back of a
package of hostess cupcakes membra no
proliferative glomerulonephritis that&#39;s
a mouthful or a lungful for my sister
Leia whose lungs began to drown in fluid
Leia at age 16 was my kingdom come I
worshipped her she&#39;s sick injustice had
chosen the closest thing I had to
divinity as the butt of his cruel joke
and while I was too young to understand
kidney failure and chronic autoimmune
disorders I was not too young to
understand chaos now you should know I&#39;m
obsessive-compulsive my bookshelf at
home is alphabetized including all 21 of
my Nancy Drew novels so what did I do
I closed my door and made lists I drew
boxes and cleaned incessantly but the
order and symmetry were not an antidote
strong enough it wasn&#39;t until I let
myself be wrapped in the dizzying
embrace of chaos that I found peace in
leaving some messes untied heed and some
questions unanswered so much beauty can
come from chaos but it&#39;s not the obvious
kind it&#39;s subtle and dazzling and yes
uncontrollable it was mayhem that healed
me but I was i chaos deficient well as
it turns out it&#39;s not just me it&#39;s an
epidemic dr. Jonathan Marshall of the
University of Technology in Sydney has
diagnosed humanity and saying that we
flee from disorder because its
associated with evil
in short the phobia of disarray has
become so prevalent that we&#39;ve come up
with a quick fix
so what&#39;s the wonder drug its order and
the moment it&#39;s lost that&#39;s where the
fear lies we are forgetting though that
often the greatest things transcend our
realm of comprehension but even beyond
that is the physical hardwiring of the
human body toward chaos Harvard Medical
School professor Airy Goldberg through
his multi decade studies of EKG patterns
discovered that rhythmic behaviors are a
symptom of pathologies such as epilepsy
and Parkinson&#39;s disease while chaotic
physical function indicates health so
what about the brain psychologists at
the University of Minnesota
Kathleen Bose placed volunteers in messy
and neat rooms and ask them to do busy
work after a period of time they were
given a creativity test those in the
chaotic environment were vastly more
likely to stray from the ordinary and
invent something new that&#39;s why it&#39;s
important that your body and mind exists
on the edge of chaos because it is the
stem of creativity and the birth mother
of spontaneity and genius I fell in love
with that Technicolor madness those
bewildering arrows pointing me every
which way only to be lost because I am
lost and it&#39;s a beautiful disaster
I&#39;m never going to understand what
happened to my sister but my hands are
tired of gripping a makeshift reasoning
I created to try and make order it was
in those months following Leia&#39;s
diagnosis that chaos and I became better
acquainted now my bookshelf at home is
still alphabetized and my rooms still
clean but i dance-like I have something
to prove like I don&#39;t care about looking
stupid I run faster than any fear I&#39;ve
ever known
I trust blindly and I love
unconditionally and I held my sister&#39;s
hand in that hospital even though I had
no idea what would happen it was the
toss of a coin the roll of a dice but
why clutch the last scraps of reason
when it&#39;s so much more pleasant to
freefall and as for that phobia of the
unknown the order it isn&#39;t working so
I&#39;m gonna prescribe something new a
healthy hearty dose of chaos
doctor&#39;s orders thank you
