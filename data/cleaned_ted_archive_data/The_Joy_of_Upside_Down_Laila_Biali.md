I&#39;m just gonna take a minute to get
comfortable here it is such an honor to
be here among you all as bruno said
moments ago I&#39;m a huge fan of Ted I
remember the very first TED talk I ever
saw which was called the paradox of
choice by Barry Schwartz did any of you
see that one anyway that was the
beginning of a beautiful relationship
with a wonderful thing and I was
thinking about how in the world I could
tie the next two songs into the topic of
building blocks not that there was a
need to do so in fact I was told that
there I didn&#39;t have to relate my music
to what was being discussed tonight and
the topic but there is a relationship in
that both these songs were the product
of what was happening during my sleeping
hours so and as you guys all know the
brain is incredibly active during sleep
we&#39;re apparently making decisions and
creative connections are being made and
that takes on importance where I&#39;m
concerned as a musician because of
course it means that songs sometimes
take shape in my sleeping brain and and
the first one that we&#39;re gonna play is
actually a breakup song and I kept
having these dreams that me and this ex
of mine had been reunited and it was
that it was almost like a positive
feedback loop but I couldn&#39;t seem to get
past it and and so I decided to write a
song about that experience because I
would wake up in the afterglow of these
false dreams and then I would kind of
come to and I would always feel a little
ripped off by the reality of my
circumstances versus what was happening
in my dream world there is however some
poetic justice in this at this time
because my now wonderful husband gets to
play a raucous drum solo at the end of
this song about my not-so-great
ex-boyfriend
and then we&#39;re gonna go straight into a
song that I wrote and about it&#39;s an
instrumental piece called joy and I
wrote it I woke up with this melody in
my head and I you know went rifling
around my room for some manuscript paper
and found some and within three minutes
a song had been born and you&#39;ll hear
it&#39;s a very simple little melody and so
I&#39;m just very thankful that these things
happen during sleep and for you math
nerds I should tell you
music math nerds more specifically this
first song called upside down Changez
meters a lot so it&#39;s like in seven four
and then four four and then five four so
if you want to count along and then give
me like a little map of what we did
rhythmically you&#39;re you&#39;re free to do so
here we go
