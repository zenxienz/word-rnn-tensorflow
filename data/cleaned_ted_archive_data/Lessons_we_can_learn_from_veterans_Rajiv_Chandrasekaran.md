good evening still trying to figure out
what I did to be assigned to follow
Elvis Costello van accident when you
think of a veteran what image comes to
mind a bedraggled guy on the sidewalk
panhandling for change a PTSD addled
fellow sitting on a sofa in a darkened
room a group of old men sipping beer in
a VFW hall let me paint a different
picture for you in april 2010 a quarter
mile wide tornado struck the town of
vilonia arkansas schools homes churches
all of them were ripped apart as if
they&#39;ve been built by matchsticks in the
wake of the devastation the usual
helping hands arrived the National Guard
the Red Cross good Samaritans and a
bunch of men and women clad an identical
great t-shirts emblazoned with the words
Team Rubicon they came there to help
residents comb through the debris for
their possessions and their keepsakes
then haul away what couldn&#39;t be salvaged
who are you guys one of the locals asked
where veterans they said we&#39;re here to
help in the wake of the tornado Team
Rubicon mobilized as an army battalion
Mike within 24 hours there were a couple
of scouts on the ground got there just
as National Guard troops were rolling in
two days later there was an advanced
party on the ground setting up tents
bringing in chainsaws and wheelbarrows
and shovels and axes and five days later
they&#39;re more than two dozen Team Rubicon
volunteers in vilonia some had driven
from as far as 300 miles away tossing
their backpacks and their pickup trucks
and driving through the night students
who had taken a week off school people
who are self-employed unemployed even a
few who would use vacation time to leave
their jobs and come and help after years
in the military loyally following orders
these men and women had earned the right
to kick back and relax during moments of
national crisis but they wouldn&#39;t
when they saw the television images of
the tornados aftermath they knew they
had to help I spent several days a
company with Team Rubicon volunteers in
Arkansas although I&#39;ve spent the better
part of five years in Iraq and
Afghanistan much that time accompanying
US troops reporting on the conflicts for
the Washington Post I&#39;m no veteran I was
there to learn more about Team Rubicon
for a book I was writing with Howard
Schultz our goal was to widen the
aperture of the modern veteran
experience and try to bridge the divide
between our civilian and our military
populations too often our media has paid
disproportionate attention to veterans
who have committed crimes those
struggling in their transitions those
grievously wounded and those are
important stories to tell but there&#39;s
been comparatively less attention paid
to veterans who have found personal or
professional success or those who are
charting a path toward it we were
motivated by a landmark survey of post
9-11 veterans of the 2.6 million
americans dispatched a fight in Iraq or
Afghanistan or in support of the wars
more than half today say they&#39;re
physical or mental health is worse than
before they deployed eighteen percent of
them say they were severely injured
while at war one in to know a fellow
service member who&#39;s attempted or
committed suicide and one and a half
million of them say their needs today
are not being met by the federal
government but when you ask them given
everything you know about the orders of
deployment the dangers of combat the
sacrifice you had to make would you do
it all over again when they were asked
this guess how many people how many of
them said they would ninety percent but
what really amazed us was when we asked
them about the country they have so
loyally served
fifty five percent of them said they
feel disconnected from civilian life in
America today how could this be the
country that they have so nobly bravely
served feel so alien to them it&#39;s
because of this giant divide between our
civilian and our military populations
you know we thank them for their service
we applaud them at sporting events but
how much do we really know them and what
they did less than 1 percent of our
countrymen have served in the military
and deployed since nine eleven less than
one percent add their family members to
the mix still less than five percent of
our population most people are
disconnected from our military so most
of our veterans are home now why does it
matter well it&#39;s more important than
ever they don&#39;t need our care packages
and quilts anymore if you need to come
back to a country that values their
service that recognizes the skills and
values discipline they&#39;ve acquired and
then gives them a chance gives them an
opportunity to succeed you need to come
back home to a country that feels
connected to them it&#39;s toot
instead of focusing instead of focusing
on how we can help our veterans we need
to need to broaden the discussion I dare
say we need to flip it we need our
veterans to help us become better
Americans consider some facts about our
modern veterans they volunteer on
average about a hundred and sixty hours
a year that&#39;s twenty-five percent more
than non-veterans about eighteen percent
of them are involved in civic
organizations compared to just six
percent of non veterans veterans vote at
higher rates than non-veterans they&#39;re
more trusting of their neighbors than
non-veterans it&#39;s time we all learn
something from them from veterans who
are members of the Mission Continues a
group that organizes our returning
service members to keep serving in the
communities there from after they take
off their uniforms from veterans who&#39;ve
traded their camouflage for the uniforms
of police officers and firefighters for
veterans were members of town councils
and school boards and even the Congress
from veterans like David aucklander
David Aucklander has spent more than 20
years in the US Army in 2010 he
commanded a thousand paratroopers in one
of the most dangerous parts of southern
Afghanistan when he came home he was
assigned to a job at the Pentagon in his
office he had three computers two of
them were connected to a classified
Department of Defense Network that gave
him access to among other things daily
reports of casualties in Afghanistan his
third computer was connected to the
public internet and his eyes often were
drawn to news reports from Chicago where
he had spent some time growing up we
kept seeing stories of gun violence in
Chicago of gun violence claiming the
lives of young people in Chicago and so
he came to recognize actually in 2011
well before it became national headlines
that we would lose more young people to
gun violence in Chicago than we would to
Taliban attacks in Afghanistan
and so David Aucklander made a decision
he decided to retire from the Army
instead of just living off his military
pension or getting a cushy job with the
defense contractor he moved his family
to Chicago figuring that everything he
knew about leading young people his
skills his values and ethics could be of
use in that city so he set out to become
a teacher and he did today he&#39;s the
principal of a high school in inner city
detroit david Aucklanders my hero not
just for what he did in the army but for
what he&#39;s doing today with so many
Americans disconnected from our military
most people don&#39;t recognize what many of
our veterans are doing back here on the
homefront and even those who are injured
in many cases can have an enormously
positive impact on the communities in
which they&#39;re living they don&#39;t
recognize that our veterans are doing
amazing things in the world of
government in business and healthcare
and education and service community
service and public service service is in
their blood this wasn&#39;t a draft army
that went to war after nine eleven these
were all men and women who put up their
hands to serve and now that they&#39;re back
home they haven&#39;t lost that service
ethos it&#39;s remarkable these men and
women who&#39;ve given so much want to keep
on giving they go off to war come home
they still outshine us so it&#39;s time to
think differently about our veterans
let&#39;s be honest saying thank you for
your service isn&#39;t enough if we truly
want to honor our veterans it&#39;s time to
follow their example it&#39;s time to create
a country that&#39;s worthy of their service
and their sacrifice thank you very much
[Applause]
