so I&#39;d like to start by telling you a
story about a girl I once encountered
like me she was Eastern European but
where exactly in Eastern Europe nobody
was quite sure because you see she
actually couldn&#39;t talk when she was
found wandering the streets of Dublin
she was lost disoriented confused she
looked like she&#39;d been abused like she
escaped from somewhere and she couldn&#39;t
speak a word it was a few days before
she felt comfortable enough to
communicate in any way at all and at
that moment people realized that this
was much worse than just an abuse victim
you see she drew pictures and in the
first series of pictures she was a stick
figure being put on a plane and it
looked like she was put on that plane
against her will in another series of
pictures she was on a bed surrounded by
men these were not pictures you wanted
to see they were incredibly disturbing
and it became clear to the police that
they were dealing with a victim of sex
trafficking I mean a young girl she
looked like she was probably about 14
years old maybe 15 alone in a foreign
country and of course she couldn&#39;t speak
I certainly wouldn&#39;t have been able to
speak in those circumstances
so they said hundreds of hours hundreds
of thousands of dollars trying to
establish this girl&#39;s identity trying to
figure out who she was where she was
from so that they could help her so that
they could reunite her with her family
men helped make her whole and it worked
it paid out they were actually able to
find who she was her name was Samantha
or Sammy as a party except here&#39;s the
thing about Sammy first she was
Australian spoke perfect English second
she wasn&#39;t 14 she was 27 third she&#39;s
never been abused in her life she came
from a very nice family and
Australia she was a serial con artist an
imposter
she was someone who had pulled this off
many times before and would go on to do
it again by the time we catch up with
her in Ireland she has already been
convicted twice a fraud in Australia
didn&#39;t serve either sentence because
she&#39;s very persuasive and very
personable she&#39;s gotten the Australian
government to think that she&#39;s a victim
of familial sexual abuse they put her in
a very nice boarding school after she&#39;s
deported from Ireland she ends up coming
back they&#39;re calling a family into
hiring her as an au pair for their two
sons who she proceeds to take care of
and she says that you know she&#39;s the
victim of a bastard royal marriage and
nobody wants her and she has to flee
goes to Canada same story this time
she&#39;s a victim of rape Canadian
government spends hundreds of hours
hundreds of thousands of dollars
figuring out who she was deport her to
Australia at this present day she&#39;s used
more than 40 aliases and has done a
version of this con in multiple
countries and let me show you her time
in the spotlight is far from over
so when I first encountered Sammy I
thought oh my god you know I actually
see a bit of myself in her because I&#39;m a
writer I&#39;m a journalist you know I write
stories I write for The New Yorker I
spent three years with con artists
writing about people like family telling
their stories and to me one of the
things that governs my life is the
notion that what I do matters that
storytelling matters that the pen is
mightier than the sword as they say and
what I saw in her was me but in some
inverted perverse funhouse mirror she is
also a storyteller she weaves powerful
narratives except instead of doing it to
show the truth to actually help make the
world a better place she does it to
deceive people I mean think about how
pernicious
she what she&#39;s doing is instead of
helping real victims she&#39;s got the
police force looking for her she&#39;s the
center of attention actual lives are at
stake and here they are catering to her
whims and I think that that is what
really drew me to these types of people
to understand the stories aren&#39;t just
powerful for the good which is how I&#39;ve
always wanted to think of them how I&#39;ve
always thought of them but that stories
can actually be very destructive and
that in the wrong hands the stories are
incredibly dangerous stories are the
oldest language we have in many ways
they predate verbal language you&#39;ve got
the last Scout cave paintings telling
stories of you know fabulous hunts you
can imagine cavemen sitting around the
fire before they can talk saying oh
there&#39;s a bear over there and the god is
angry you know the river is flooding
there&#39;s stuff going on so stories are
just something that we use to draw us
together and to communicate and in fact
pre verbal language might be more
powerful in some ways than words and so
Sammy didn&#39;t actually need to talk in
order to convey such a powerful
narrative in one study psychologists
actually had people look at people who
were acting in a play and they had them
judge what was going on the emotion the
action kind of what was happening on
stage the thing was they couldn&#39;t
actually understand the words the words
were masked and they found that
nonverbal cues were 22 times more
effective in predicting how people would
judge the action and that there were
four times more predictive of the
emotion that the actors were feeling
than the words themselves so even when
they totally mask the words people still
could tell the story and that shows just
how powerful some of these methods of
storytelling are how emotional they are
on what a basic level we are able to
communicate and in some ways that&#39;s why
stories are so dangerous because emotion
isn&#39;t like fact emotion is not something
that you challenge in the same way that
you challenge logic I
what kind of a person does it make me if
a girl comes up to me and looks lost and
can&#39;t talk looks like she&#39;s been abused
and I say are you who you say you are
have you really been abused I don&#39;t know
if I can help you without proof who
would do that I mean I would be a
terrible human being of course I&#39;m going
to go out of my way to help her of
course I&#39;m going to come along because I
don&#39;t even think I&#39;m going to be
deceived and what ends up happening is
that we believe stories even when we
know they&#39;re fiction we can actually get
by different facts in them and think
that they are true so there&#39;s a
Princeton University psychologist
Deborah Prentice and in 1997 she ran a
really interesting study she said what
would happen if I had people read
excerpts of novels so something that
they know is fiction with some facts
thrown in because fiction writers like
to put in a few fact how will they
actually see the world are they going to
question the fact so for instance
there&#39;s a novel from the 80s called the
liar Orpheus and in it there&#39;s a there&#39;s
a swimmin Maria and Maria says something
about fetal alcohol syndrome she says oh
you know it only you have to drink so
much in order for fetal alcohol syndrome
to develop which is scientifically
completely false you actually only need
to drink a tiny amount all that matters
is timing but what ended up happening is
that when people read excerpts from
novels knowing there were excerpts from
novels like that they believed the fact
as well as the fiction even such
whoppers as the Sun is actually good for
your skin people read that or like oh
interesting I guess I guess this one is
good for me I&#39;m going to go sunbathing
you know I&#39;m going to have vitamins
develop and all sorts of great stuff and
so what happens is you are so caught up
in the action that you no longer
question the facts you just assume
they&#39;re true the first time I read
through the study I thought that&#39;s I
don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think this study is
for real how could that ever happen and
then I noticed that it had happened to
me I was having a conversation with some
and I was telling them in vivid detail
about the streetcars in Union Square in
the 1800s and how there used to be
really dangerous curves and a lot of
people died there were some fatal
accidents and nobody would fix these
curves and my audience was listening
around dinner beam ago that&#39;s really
interesting I want to read this history
book you know where can I read about New
York in the 1800s and I thought about it
for a second and I realized it&#39;s from a
novel I read so I have no idea if any of
those details are actually true I had
just assumed this and was now telling it
to someone else as fact stories do that
to us they make us not motivated to
question Daniel Gilbert at Harvard
University says that we actually see the
world in two steps so our first step is
assuming everything is true and then we
verify it we say oh is it actually true
or false I&#39;m going to tag it accordingly
so I actually see this as the pink
elephant view of the world so when I say
pink elephant all of a sudden for a
fraction of a second you have pink
elephants who are going to be jumping
around in your mind before you realize
oh wait pink elephants don&#39;t actually
exist I need to fix this belief pink
elephants are false when you&#39;re
listening to a story that second part
doesn&#39;t actually happen you don&#39;t notice
you&#39;re surrounded by pink elephants and
so suddenly you have a stampede of pink
elephants that&#39;s careening around Union
Square causing fatal Street car
accidents and you&#39;re just fine you think
oh yes this is the way the world works
and this is what stories do this is why
stories are powerful this is why people
like Samantha as a party are so
incredibly dangerous because think about
how surrounded we are by stories
everyone is telling us stories
politicians tell us stories journalists
like me tell us stories entrepreneurs
tell you stories foundation myths
you know how they got started they say
that in law the person who wins the case
isn&#39;t the lawyer with the best evidence
it&#39;s the lawyer who presents the
strongest story that&#39;s who the jury is
going to
and I realized you know spending so much
time with con artists has definitely
made me cynical
I&#39;ve emerged thinking you know people
suck everyone is going to deceive you
you should just you know lock lock away
the key
throw in a key lock your door just don&#39;t
trust anyone whenever you hear a sob
story
you better get fat checking and now I
realize that&#39;s not actually true you
know samantha has a party is an
exception not everyone is out there
conning but my cynicism has actually
kind of paid off in the sense that you
know I have an alert out for all the con
artists I wrote about including Sammy
just to see you know will they rise
again and a few weeks ago I got an alert
in my mailbox I think she probably knew
I was going to be doing a TED talk about
her and so all of a sudden I get the
solar Samantha&#39;s a party I click on it
to see what it is lo and behold another
victim this one&#39;s an American student
and Samantha posed as an 18 year old
teenager sharing a hostel with her in
Australia somehow managed to convince
her that Interpol was after both of them
this poor girl ended up getting fake IDs
made but deported from Australia because
she&#39;d broken the law and now has a
criminal record so this bond this poor
girl just didn&#39;t even know what hit her
you know she thought that she was
helping a friend and it ended up it was
Samantha as a party and so when you see
stories like that you realize it really
the pen is mightier than the sword and
it is a double-edged sword so it&#39;s
something that has to be wielded with a
lot of care you know when when I first
met the story about the party I&#39;ve
actually never met her in person now I
wish that would have happened but you
never agreed I wonder why
when when I first encountered the story
I thought you know why does she keep
doing this and I think I might have the
answer and it lies in the power of
stories so there&#39;s another now cliche
that comes from George Orwell which is
that power corrupts and absolute power
corrupts absolutely the power of stories
can corrupt you I think she
have gotten carried away by her own
silver tongue by her own ability to do
this because it&#39;s addictive I mean
realizing that you can control people&#39;s
lives with the stories that you tell
it&#39;s a huge power that we storytellers
hold and it&#39;s a power that I think needs
to be wielded wisely and wielded you
know with with a lot of restraint
because one of the things I realized is
that stories on their own have
absolutely no moral compass it&#39;s only
the people who tell them who have the
moral compass and it&#39;s so it&#39;s incumbent
on us as storytellers as story listeners
to trust but to verify and to make sure
that the stories that become truly
powerful the stories that are told and
retold are the stories that deserve it
thank you
