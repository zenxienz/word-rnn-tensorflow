hi
testers this is my
active and welcome to my backyard that&#39;s
how we call Whistler here yes my name is
what&#39;s up chink I&#39;m one of the local
entertainers here and so one thing I was
wondering like if this pad is active
does it make really Ted and uncover
passive well welcome today active
outdoor place of Canada cycling is my
passion and so this is what I&#39;m going to
tell you a little bit how many people
actually write bikes to actually have
bikes here Oh perfect perfect well you
probably if you&#39;re using bikes you
probably use some bike computers and
many traditional bike computers like
this one use and use a magnet on a
spokes to measure your distance if you
I&#39;m going to have a cyclist you probably
experience the problem like what I
experience quite often you go for the
right you load your bike in the car
unloaded mount the wheels then you go
for a ride and suddenly notice that your
wheel sensor skips few revolutions it
usually happens because magnets get
shifted while you&#39;re unloading it so now
you need to stop adjustment magnet make
sure that everything works and go for I
probably have to catch up with your
friends so probably lose some of your
precious data well traditional sensors
use magnets and this is a hassle they
are also not very accurate the accuracy
of this sensor is your full wheel
revolution which is about seven feet of
distance over two meters when we started
dealing with this problem we wanted to
create sensor which will be more
accurate but also less complex over the
last seven years we&#39;ve been working with
this problem with my team in the team up
at first is very nice solution the
sensor which was very accurate is about
360 times more accurate than any sensors
ever created
but it hasn&#39;t been smooth sailing the
entirely way we actually made a typical
engineering mistake we over engineered
the solution and then this fell into
common traps what engineers experienced
if somebody has created the sensor or
engineer is the magnet and this saw that
status quo we created our sensors which
was more accurate but still use the same
magnet on a spot and it took us a while
to figure out what was the bargain our
solution you&#39;re trying to offset some
naturally occurring matter like
magnetism we thought there is a bargain
on sensor solution we created very
complex outages to offset it but still
couldn&#39;t resolve it at last
we took a giant step back and looked at
the problem from a wider angle and then
Eureka what was the problem became a
solution what was the bag became a
feature now you can see how accurate the
sensor is as soon as I attach the wheel
you can see the distances moona it
actually works backwards to now the this
kind of sensors can be used by
professional riders but also is in
orders there are no magnets whatsoever
on this wheel which makes it really easy
for you you just snap the wheel and go
no hassle whatsoever
now this sensor works with Bluetooth
devices but we also have a ant device
which can work with the Garmin computers
and many other devices what we learned
from our experience is that if you have
a problem the nature always offers you a
solution all you need to do is step back
look at the problem and you probably
find a solution in nature itself thank
you for your attention
if you want to talk to me and learn how
that technology works please I&#39;ll be
around the guy with a bike here thank
you
