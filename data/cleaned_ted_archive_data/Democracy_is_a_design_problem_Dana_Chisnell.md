this is a forum yeah I know it doesn&#39;t
look like much it&#39;s really just a list
of names but this particular forum
changed everything this is a an election
ballot from the US presidential election
in the year 2000 from Palm Beach County
Florida it is notoriously known as the
butterfly ballot this forum like all
forms is made up of hundreds of design
decisions and constraints here&#39;s how it
works that ballot looks like a book and
it rests and in apparatus under which
you slide a rectangular card on the card
is printed a bunch of tiny little
numbers and around each number is a
perforated box it&#39;s called a Chad to
vote voter pushes the card behind the
book and the numbers line up with holes
between the two pages and you press a
pin through one of the holes to push the
Chad out of the card this was
state-of-the-art technology in the 1960s
and it actually worked really well for
decades but then in Florida in 2000
local election officials knew that the
presidential election was going to be
really important and they wanted to make
sure that everyone could use and read
the ballots they were putting out and
knowing that there were thousands of
older voters in Palm Beach County the
person who was in charge of ballot
design and layout there wanted to do a
thing that would help her many older
voters she decided to increase the type
size people often asked for larger type
older people especially asked for a
larger type the way this ballot was
meant to be designed was all of the
names are lined up on the left-hand page
with nothing on the right-hand page but
when you increase the type size it
overflows onto two pages forming and
interlaced effect thus the butterfly
ballot if you wanted to vote for Al Gore
on this ballot how do you do that well
thousands of people thought it was the
second hole that they should punch but
it&#39;s actually the third hole if you
punch the second hole you cast a vote
for Pat Buchanan who is a conservative
religious fundamentalist kind of guy
not the progressive liberal
environmentalist that Al Gore is
ultimately George W Bush became 43rd
President of the United States after a
whole bunch of counting and recounting
of ballots exactly like this so the
design decision to increase the type
size seemed like really good public
administration we were paying attention
to voters needs but it turned out not to
be great design because thousands of
voters left the polling place in
November 2000 wondering did I actually
vote for the person I meant to vote for
to me this was a straight-up design
problem pure and simple and I wondered
how it happens in elections that you we
end up with a situation like this after
all a ballot is a designed artifact and
it&#39;s made up of design decisions
apparently small kind of mundane
decisions but every single one of them
makes a difference
voting in America is actually really
hard the smartest people you know the
best educated people you know have made
mistakes when they vote you probably
have made mistakes when you voted and
you didn&#39;t even know it I know people
with master&#39;s degrees in political
science who leave the polling place
going I really don&#39;t know whether I
marked the ballot the right way the
butterfly ballot inspired me to look at
how elections are run under the covers
what administration of elections looks
like not the campaign side and so I&#39;ve
had the great fortune to interact and
work with thousands of excellent
election officials and dozens of
brilliant designers and researchers to
understand how it is that we can use
design to ensure voter intent there are
still problems with ballot design even
after all these years since the
butterfly ballot debacle one is
splitting contest between two columns of
a ballot when ballots are laid out this
way many voters will vote twice in the
same contest and neither vote will count
another problem is when using arrows as
markers on the ballot rather than
bubbles that you fill in and having
markers on the ballot on either side of
the names that appear there so which
candidate does which arrow belong to
here is it this one or is it this one I
would actually like to meet the person
who came up with this particular design
this idea of the arrows because I would
like to know what happened in his head
when he came up with this super
unconventional way of marking a choice
when there were perfectly good ways to
do that because the way you mark this
ballot is you join the two ends of the
arrow in 2006 Sarasota County in Florida
held an election on its new touchscreen
voting systems so lest you think that
computers might be the answer best
practice for software design is one task
per screen best practice for election
design is one contest per screen but
there were several pages several screens
in this ballot on this touchscreen
system in Sarasota County that had
multiple contests on them notable among
them was a contest for house of
representatives for congressional
district 13 the contest appeared on the
second screen of the ballot with the
contest for governor now in a typical
election only about 1% of voters who
cast a ballot will not vote in a contest
like representative because this is the
Congress person like this is the person
they&#39;re going to send to Washington to
represent them people want to vote in
this contest but in this election
thirteen point nine percent of voters
that&#39;s about 18,000 people you ever take
did not vote for their representative
after extensive investigation no
technological or mechanical reason was
found for this issue
luckily US elections offer us all kinds
of natural experiments and one played
out in neighboring Charlotte County
we&#39;re also in congressional district 13
the contest for representative appeared
on a page by itself and the under vote
rate was less than one percent nearly
everybody who cast a ballot cast a vote
for their representative Sarasota County
changed its voting system after that
election they replace it with paper
ballots that are optically scanned this
time you fill out a bubble and because
the head of elections had understandably
been traumatized well maybe she was a
little skittish about what might happen
based on her previous experience she
wanted to make sure that everybody in
her County was going to be able to read
and use the ballots that she issued so
she joined with a partner and Duvall
County and they commissioned to study in
this study design researchers met with
individual participants and gave them a
copy of the ballot that was going to be
used in the November upcoming election
told them to vote as they normally would
now all of the voters in the study were
frequent avid voters like all of them
had just voted in the presidential
primary election
but many of them had to be reminded to
turn the ballot over then vote the
second side
in spite of there being a huge notice at
the bottom of the ballot that said vote
both sides when you look at the entire
ballot and you see this on there you
would probably find the same thing that
the participants did which is it just
looks like it&#39;s part of the frame of the
document the solution was to move the
instruction to the bottom of the
right-hand column underneath the last
contest on both sides so in neighboring
counties they left the instruction at
the bottom in Sarasota and Duvall they
moved it up in Sarasota and Duvall
counties the under vote rate for a state
constitutional amendment that was on the
second side of the ballot was 10.2%
seems kind of high but when you look at
the 15 other counties in the area that
also had this same constitutional
amendment on the second side of their
ballot the under vote rate was 14 point
7 percent that difference that four and
a half percent difference means that
about twenty eight thousand votes were
saved in Sarasota and Duval County by
making this tiny mundane design change
that would be really easy to single
Florida out but it would be totally
unfair because these kinds of things
happen all over the country in
practically every election in the u.s.
we actually demand a lot from voters
getting to the polls is hard enough but
then we put a ballot in your hand where
dozens of design decisions get in the
way of you being able to execute your
intent so things like the instructions
are inscrutable or it&#39;s hard to tell one
contest from the next or the type is too
small or in some cases too big now the
thing is
election officials are not designers and
they don&#39;t have designers on their staff
so how do you solve a problem like this
how do you solve all of these small
problems that make such a big difference
if election officials could just do a
few small things that were free or cheap
that were easy to do because they don&#39;t
have much in the way of tools and are
illegal what would those things be it
turns out that there are 10 really
simple design principles this is basic
design this is design that everyone can
do this is design that election
officials now do any single one of these
implemented reasonably well would make a
huge difference for voters but taken
together there are a super powerful
toolkit and it&#39;s in use already and
gaining traction every day to borrow a
line from William Gibson good design in
election administration has arrived it&#39;s
just not evenly distributed when good
design is present there are far fewer
lost votes there are fewer recounts
voters are way more confident in the
outcomes of elections and they&#39;re much
more likely to show up in the next
election because they had a good
experience in this one with every
election we learn and with every
election more voters can confidently
vote the way they intend but until
design is evenly distributed across
America in election administration I
leave you with the election officials
prayer may the margin of victory be wide
thank you
