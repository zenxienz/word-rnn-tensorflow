so I feel very lucky to be here at Ted
and to hear about words sorry should
have gone something different there we
go I think Jed is all about ideas worth
spreading but of course those come with
words worth knowing and I thought one of
the words that I think every
neurotypical person should know is the
word neuro diversity which we heard
yesterday from steve silverman and then
of course we heard the word kinetic
attack which is basically throwing
something at people you don&#39;t like with
great force but it&#39;s an interesting word
because it&#39;s a retro NIM because David
Rothkopf was talking about cyber attack
and until you have cyber attacks you
don&#39;t really have to distinguish kinetic
attacks um Kourt scraper which was in
the mark Kushner lunch it&#39;s a blend of a
european-style courtyard building with a
new york-style skyscraper there&#39;s also
photo clinometer e which is taking a
picture of something and using the light
and dark patterns figuring out what the
terrain looks like which we heard in
Fred Jensen&#39;s talk there&#39;s also
placemaking which snuck into Theaster
gates talk it was von one of his slides
always read the slides and it&#39;s the idea
that the design and management of public
places and that public places are the
most important part of a community and I
think if you listen to his talk you
believe that too wide pin so regime in
his rob said a lot of basketball terms I
still can&#39;t tell you what a wide pin is
but I fell into this rabbit hole of
basketball terms including the curly
curl fade pop I don&#39;t know what that is
it&#39;s just really fun to say uh and of
course we just heard this word so I hope
you remember what event someone who
studies flags really interesting thing
about this word is that we&#39;ve had flags
for hundreds of years this word dates to
1959 so it&#39;s never too late to make up a
word to study something with belt
this was a great word there are a lot of
other words that are related to this
word there&#39;s mirka veldt there&#39;s in
adult there&#39;s work angles of melt
they&#39;re basically there&#39;s a world of
veldt words if if you need them ah Fras
is the more or less solid excreta of
insects and we heard that in BAM Ronald
stock so this comes from the past tense
of a German word meaning to gobble and
before I learned that I had never
thought of excretion as the past tense
of eating so and i thought this Oh back
one this word was wonderful Monica told
us that in order to in order to change
the world we have to change our beliefs
and I believe that this word if we all
become one will help us a overturn the
humiliation industrial complex that she
was talking about I of course Ted is
still going on there&#39;s still many more
words we could hear over the next day so
if you see a new word that you love
please tweet it to us that we&#39;re Nick
thanks so much
