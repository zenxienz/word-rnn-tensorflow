I&#39;m an architect a son a father and a
brother on jun 7 2013 that afternoon is
I finished presenting at a design
workshop here in Vancouver I started to
receive phone calls telling me that Paul
had gone missing I drove with his
girlfriend to his three-storey stuck a
walk up as we climb the stairs we
noticed a terrible chemical stench his
apartment door was blocked by a heavy
object that object was my brother&#39;s body
he died while trying to get out this is
Paul you&#39;ll see color photos of him and
our family the black-and-white images
are from my friend Lincoln Clark&#39;s photo
essay of women of Vancouver&#39;s Downtown
Eastside Canada&#39;s poorest neighborhood
many are heroin addicts and some are
dead Paul was born because my parents
were worried that the large gap between
me and my next older brother would leave
me lonely and spoiled we played together
all our lives everywhere from the woods
of Eastern Ontario to the bars of East
Vancouver when he died he was a
well-liked and much respected loud
technologist at a local hospital he
loved science and had previously worked
researching marine sources of
antibiotics he was a deeply generous guy
a great cook a better uncle than I am an
incredibly funny he was also a
manufacturer of illegal drugs
principally MDMA also known as ecstasy
Paul was not a drug dealer in the usual
sense he was an activist he believed
that drug use was like prostitution and
ingrained aspect of any advanced culture
that could never be wiped out by
prohibition in his view the greatest
harm in our culture&#39;s relationships with
with drugs was the absence of a safe
supply and lack of honest information
about responsible use and risks this
harm is a direct
result of a system that treats matters
of drugs and addiction as criminal
justice matters not as issues of health
and education put another way he knew
the kids were going to do e at raves no
matter how many cops we have in the
street and he thought those kids should
know what they were getting he died
while purifying two point two kilos of
dirty Street ecstasy in his kitchen the
beakers of chemicals boiled on a
stovetop for 24 hours before we
discovered his body everything in his
apartment was destroyed as a toxic risk
we couldn&#39;t even get the family photos
from his hard drive although he was
committed to safety of supply for
ecstasy users my brother was no hero he
loved the juice of illegal activity he
lied to me for years and telling me was
out of the business his death forced his
neighbors to evacuate their homes for
two days and that is inexcusable it&#39;s
hard when someone you&#39;ve loved your
entire life has passions that are
illegal and dangerous let me use another
family example our father was a
successful psychiatrist who is also an
alcoholic without discounting the
terrible costs of alcoholism because his
drug of choice was Scotch of which there
is a reliable and clean supply he was
able to have a great career and raise
the loving family had this drug of
choice being heroin I would not be here
there is a direct line between the death
of my brother at least 10 recent and
completely avoidable deaths in Western
Canada caused by toxic dirty ecstasy
millions of lives ruined by
incarceration gang violence and more
than 50,000 vicious drug war deaths in
Mexico and Central America as creators
of the current system of prohibition
those deaths are our responsibility we
have blood on our hands let me go back
to family the worst part about the
terrible night that my brother died
wasn&#39;t being stripped and
decontaminated while shaking with grief
it wasn&#39;t dealing with the police or
dealing with the media who was telling
our mother when we told her that her
youngest son was dead the third of her
six children did she lost she began a
conversation that I found odd at the
time she started talking about a trip to
ottawa year months away where she and i
were she was going to see me receive a
major design award i invited her because
i never would have been an architect
without my mom&#39;s years of support but i
couldn&#39;t understand why it was important
to talk about the trip at the moment of
family catastrophe later I understood
that in the face of darkness she needed
some light to move towards later still
she told me that she was too old to ever
get over the death of paul but that it
did not need to ruin everything in her
life and she could still contribute to
the world with her passion for community
for me speaking openly about my brother
and and advocating for changes in drug
policy is my way of holding that passion
I&#39;m not a drug policy expert my field is
architecture but I and my family and
countless others around the globe have
had a direct and painful experience of
the impact of misguided drug policy and
I believe an important step towards
change is when people of personal
experience and credibility but who are
not expert in an issue beginning to
speak out the supporters of the current
policy of prohibition have had their
time to make it work and they have
failed drug interdiction is not
effective and it&#39;s not ethical a
strategy guided by public health best
practices that make substances carefully
available but does not promote the use
is one that&#39;s proven to reduce use abuse
addiction and the terrible social
consequences of prohibition I want my
son Paul Griffin Hayden
to grow up in a world that more
responsibly handles his heart issue my
wife Holly i gifted her son with the
name paul a reminder both of my
brother&#39;s great joy in living and that a
death that was so tragic for us can be
transformative for others thank you
you
