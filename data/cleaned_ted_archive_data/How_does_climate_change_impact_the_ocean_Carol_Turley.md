we are at a major decision point for the
climate of our planet if we keep on
doing what we&#39;re doing
the earth will be warmer weather will be
more extreme the ice will melt and the
sea levels will rise but few are
actually looking below the surface of
the ocean and the ocean has a story to
tell it is at the frontline of climate
change it&#39;s absorbing 90% of the heat
from global warming it&#39;s absorbing
nearly 30% of the carbon dioxide we&#39;re
admitting to the atmosphere and it is
absorbing all the water from the melting
ice so it is the unsung hero of climate
change truly this is what a healthy
ocean looks like this is what a coral
reef will look like in the future if we
keep on doing what we&#39;re doing now
corroded overgrown with algae and
bleached so this is what makes planet
Earth different to every other planet
it&#39;s the ocean 70 percent of the surface
area 94 percent of the living space
harboring huge biodiversity it also
gives us an awful lot of other things
food aquaculture it feeds people it
moves heat around the planet
it controls gases in the atmosphere like
oxygen and there&#39;s a lot of industries
pharmaceuticals mining tourism it&#39;s
hugely important to life on the planet
but there is a Silent Storm gathering
you can&#39;t hear it you can&#39;t see it and
the course is increasing carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere through us burning
fossil fuels already just in my lifetime
and I won&#39;t tell you quite how long that
is but you can work it out is it&#39;s risen
from 310 to 400 parts per million of co2
that&#39;s 29 percent increase in my
lifetime and when that co2 is absorbed
by the ocean this very simple range of
chemical reactions that occur you add
co2 to water and it forms an acid
Cassatt and then that runs through a
whole range of other chemical reactions
which are also important to the marine
organisms it affects the carbonate cycle
in all sorts of different ways I&#39;m going
to pick one and this is aragonite it&#39;s a
calcium carbonate mineral used by
organisms like corals to build their
shells and other shelled organisms as
well use this and as you see it running
through the worst-case-scenario high co2
scenario you will see that the Arctic
Ocean is already going it&#39;s going
corrosive to aragonite and that&#39;s within
decades most of the Arctic is corrosive
that&#39;s the red bit this is closely
followed by the Antarctic in the
southern ocean but also the
concentration of aragonite in the whole
global ocean is decreasing so even in
the tropics
those coral reefs they&#39;re going to find
it harder and harder to extract that
mineral in order to build their reefs so
that&#39;s just one example of the speed of
change and I want to really knock this
home as the speed of change is what
matters here if you look back into time
you will see that the pH the ocean pH
hasn&#39;t changed much for millions of
years and then you will see this nearly
vertical line and that&#39;s caused by us
this is the change in ocean pH due to
our co2 emissions into the atmosphere
and it&#39;s that speed of change that is
really of concern because the oceans
will eventually buffer all of this out
but it&#39;s going to take tens of thousands
of years to do it so what we&#39;re doing
now in just a couple of centuries is
going to have an impact for a very long
time and I&#39;m not sure we want to go
there so it&#39;s not surprising that
scientists all around the world have
been galvanized when they&#39;ve really
taken on this ocean acidification
problem these are marine chemists out
there measuring the parameters that
determine ocean acidification and what
they&#39;ve found is that the top line here
is the atmospheric co2 you reckon
that&#39;s increasing year on year on year
and the Green Line the line decreasing
is the pH of the ocean decreasing so
there&#39;s this direct relationship about
the amount of co2 we put in the
atmosphere and the decrease in pH here
we got marine scientists and marine
biogeochemist
led by Germany in this case engulfing
huge vast plastic bags full of water to
study the plankton how they will be
impacted by ocean acidification in the
future so they are able to control the
co2 in these different very large
plastic bags and what they&#39;re finding is
even the small smallest plankton can be
impacted by ocean acidification and if
the small the base of the food webs
impacted you could be sure that the top
is impacted to here scientists perched
on marginal sea ice looking at the
effects of ocean acidification on on
those communities and others looking at
the effects on other forms of corals
deep-sea corals as numerous as the
wonderful warm water curls we have
around us and what they&#39;re finding is
that in in the Arctic and the polar
waters tiny little potato chips of the
ocean Terra positive sea butterflies
hugely important food resource for
whales for salmon for birds are actually
corroding today their shells are
corroding today so they&#39;re very
vulnerable to future ocean acidification
the cold water corals CC enormous ly
important deep ocean habitats are
actually get more fragile as co2
increases so again they&#39;re hugely
vulnerable and this is biologists
swimming in a sea of bubbling co2 these
are natural vents whether co2 is coming
through the seabed so this is a
fantastic natural laboratory to study
what a future ocean may look like and
this is just off Papua New Guinea and
these vents are coming through
coral reefs and you can see a very
healthy reef with today&#39;s pH huge
biodiversity lots of one
full structure creating habitats and you
can see how that degrades as the pH
changes such that there&#39;s hardly any
structural growth or calcification in
the lower pH waters in the Mediterranean
there&#39;s another wonderful fence system
and again today&#39;s pH is wonderfully
biodiverse loads of calcifiers and then
it moves as you get closer to those
vents and pH Falls to where there&#39;s
hardly any calcifiers it goes through a
regime shift in reduced biodiversity
with some organisms actually really
enjoying it sea grasses love co2 so they
do very well but things like introduce
species so that we do very well and
that&#39;s less helpful now I&#39;m the bearer
of bad news because there are other
issues happening at the same time as
ocean acidification oceans are warming
and sea level is rising as well and this
means that sea water will warm by over 2
degrees C on average pH will fall by
naught point 4 units that doesn&#39;t sound
much but that&#39;s over a hundred percent
change and sea level will rise by nearly
a meter not point eight plus but if we
control our emissions urgently and
reduce them considerably we can reduce
the amount of warming the amount of
acidification and the amount of sea
level rise and this is a study we did
looking at key aspects of marine
ecosystems of these multiple stressors
because they stack together they have
greater impact and one on their own and
you&#39;ll see that a lot of key ecosystems
like sea grasses coral reefs pteropods
bivalves and various fish are at very
high risk or high risk at the high co2
scenario on the other hand you reduce
that risk considerably if we go to the
low emissions scenario for co2 but
there&#39;s still a risk to things like
corals and bivalves now we all depend on
a lot of the services and goods that the
ocean provides us so when we convert
those into risks as well you can see the
whole
co2 scenario actually means that there a
lot of those goods and services the risk
is very high and high on the other hand
if we reduce our emissions we reduce
that risk considerably so I&#39;m one of the
scientists growing number of scientists
are actually taking these messages to
policymakers whether the decisions the
knowledge is required for decisions to
be made for the future and they asked me
well what can we do about it Carl you
know can we manage your way out of it
can we adapt what can we do and I think
there&#39;s four things that need to be done
firstly we need to reduce local stresses
to create that a healthy system so that
they can cope with some change so we
need to reduce the pollutants we need to
reduce things like fishing and
destructive fishing practice we need to
create MPAs to protect that area to give
it a chance of starting chance the
second thing I think we need to do is
create a global ocean acidification
observing Network and this is based on
the concept that how can you manage
something that you&#39;re not measuring and
at the moment there are very few
countries measuring ocean acidification
and it should be global and if you look
at that map there you will see there are
enormous gaps mostly in the southern
hemisphere and certainly around people
most vulnerable and waters most
vulnerable to ocean acidification so I
think we need to transfer technology
build capacity and get more countries
measuring ocean acidification so that
they can be forewarned and forearmed in
order to to help manage and adapt to a
changing ocean this brings me to
adaptation whatever happens the oceans
will change so we need to think of how
people can adapt to a changing ocean as
especially the most vulnerable that
depend on food fish for food and and
ecosystems for protection of their land
or income from tourism and it&#39;s very
interesting that very little research
has gone into adaptation we&#39;ve been made
we focused on impact you know what&#39;s
happening to marine systems but we
actually have to think about how
adaptation occurs as well and this is
the Taylor
boy stur shellfish hatchery on the west
coast of North America and they had
massive death of their larval oysters
they eventually tracked it down to ocean
acidification events that were happening
on along the west coast upwelling of
high co2 low pH water so now they have
invested about half a million dollars
into monitoring the water the intake
water and then they can actually they
know what to do in terms of of this so
this is a short-term adaptation that
it&#39;ll last for a while but it&#39;s not a
long-term adaptation the other thing
they&#39;re investing in is a breeding
program for the oysters they&#39;re trying
to find stirs that are less vulnerable
to ocean acidification and this may be
important to do all around the world to
really help people adapt to a really
changing ocean and what about people
more vulnerable is there a possibility
that say in Indonesia the culture of
growing algae and ran and farming algae
can be used as a means of extracting
carbon from the ocean and therefore
buffer reduce ocean acidification and
perhaps buffer the reefs you know that
though we&#39;ve got no idea about any of
that but what we do know is that if we
do this we really have to test any of
those strategies that we put in place to
make sure that there&#39;s no unforeseen
consequences and this means scientists
working with local communities across
national boundaries to put in adaptation
policies so here we are we&#39;ve got two
choices for high co2 business-as-usual
choice where the oceans were warm when
acidify and sea level will rise and we
got the other choice of really really
stringent co2 emissions reductions where
there will be some warming some increase
in acidity and some sea level rise and
this is what they&#39;re calling the two
degree
see target now this is the very least I
think we should shoot for we should go
lower because we can see what what will
still happen there&#39;s still risk to the
ocean but it must be the very minimum
consequence so it&#39;s a global issue and
we need global action at the United
Nations level and it&#39;s not surprising
that they&#39;re all meeting at the end of
this year in December in Paris at a big
climate to conference and all our
negotiators will be there with our co2
offers of reduction and we have to make
sure that any agreement takes those
impacts of ocean into account and
mitigates those we cannot leave this to
a future generation it&#39;s all about
energy and energies or economics so
they&#39;re all connected and we have to
change the way we use and produce energy
the future of our planet is in our hands
much of it is ocean and we really cannot
ignore what is happening below the
surface it has a story to tell
we should tell it and we should listen
to the ocean thank you
