hello everyone I&#39;m so excited to be in
Vancouver and it&#39;s my first time here
the science one I saw on my way on the
Main Street was so glorious it made me
think there is so much in the world to
draw inspiration from for me it&#39;s my
amazing fiction books arts and crafts my
favorite youtubers such as superwoman
Lilly Singh and Me Baby
who are known for their amazing videos
and the fun-loving quality also amazing
music videos such as the song what makes
you beautiful by one direction and my
Furby boom die which is a die that lives
with me like my bed all this inspiration
around me gives me ideas and motivates
me to keep doing something unique like
write songs of my own to make my school
notes on cool post-its to write songs
learn my favorite school topics and to
decorate my bookshelf all these things
may appear small but every inspiration
from around me encourages me to do
something creative and feel very happy
and energized thanks to being encouraged
I wrote and published a book called
Simran&#39;s diary which is about a girl
called children who goes to many twists
turns and adventures along with her
family and at the point she fulfills her
dream yes we children should be
encouraged to do what we like in
particular girls should be encouraged
more than they are now
well at least in my country and this may
be happening in
countries around the world a real-life
example is when girls are made to think
what to wear and what not to and where
to go and where not do we children are
born without fear and this fear of not
doing certain things discourages a child
to follow their creative interests and
likings let me tell you a cycle occurs
when children are encouraged when we
children are supported we do something
creative which makes us feel happy
seeing this happiness makes our parents
delighted to encourage us even more
however if children are not encouraged
this cycle could be just the opposite we
kids already have so many ideas that are
to the world instead of asking children
what they want to be when they grow up
you should ask them what they want to be
now I think thanks
I think age is just a number we can do a
lot in this moment in the present the
problem is ours has many forces working
against the dreams of children let me
tell you about four things that worry me
the most
first and foremost children are losing
their childhood at an early age
parents don&#39;t have enough time for their
children in the present moment as they
are busy building a nest for the future
also if you look at our schools the
child is made to focus on the
examination which would be coming in the
future and so the child forgets to enjoy
in the present moment perhaps if we
focus on doing the right thing now the
future will take care of itself
my second money is a limitation of food
and water to fulfill our daily needs we
don&#39;t have enough water today itself
what will happen in the future the cost
of food may increase so much that the
poor may not be able to afford it a
hungry child cannot think about anything
other than the desire to eat another of
my worries is more war and rivalry look
at the world around us
people are becoming so angry and
short-tempered we children become what
we see around us instead of going into a
war with another country we can think
twice and create friendship between two
countries my final big worry is the
increase in school fee of different
schools the school fee is already so
much back in my city
many schools hike their fee every year
what will happen after two or five years
parents may have to pay millions to get
good education for their children being
educated is a basic right for anyone and
I think the school fee should be such
that it can be afforded by most parents
I dream about a future where people
think 10 times for increasing the school
fee of the school hundred times before
going to a war with another country
thousand times before wasting food and
water and ten thousand times before
letting their child&#39;s childhood go away
I hope you adults can look after the
world long enough to give us a chance
I&#39;m hoping to do so many things I&#39;ve
only started as a writer as a creator
youtuber and as a reader and weird how
can I forget as a child
please help create a world then shows
that all children are healthy fed safe
and educated and please encourage the
young people you know to start living
their dreams as goalie as possible right
now why should any of us waste a moment
thank you so much
thank you thank you so much you know you
just you just asked a bunch of adults
here to do something really hard to work
hard so that your future would be okay
and they all stood up and cheered here
okay
it&#39;s does that happen when you ask your
parents to do something hard for you my
parents are always very supportive when
I ask them to do something when I tell
them I want to do something they&#39;re very
happy with what I want to do always
supporting never forced me about
anything I have to tell you they&#39;re
doing something right so thank you so
much for starting this Ted wonderful
thank you
