so if words could dream I think they&#39;ve
a dream of being used in TED talks so
obviously this word from Adam grant had
to come first although I didn&#39;t decide
this till about 15 minutes ago uh the
the crass didn&#39;t 8 part actually comes
from a Latin root that means belonging
to tomorrow the cord stick we saw that
wonderful instrument a cross between a
hammer dulcimer and an electric guitar
being played by so percussion they&#39;re
actually I believe the first group who
have ever used that instrument in
performance it was invented by Bryce
Dessner um the magnetar is the world&#39;s
most bad-ass the universe most bad-ass
star the little logos there the smiley
face means that it&#39;s in a traditional
dictionary the hands means that the word
is used in a band name magnet ours are
so powerful that if you put one between
the Earth and the moon just ask any
friendly Ted astrophysicist how to do
that they&#39;ll be happy to help if if you
did that it would destroy every credit
card on earth and magnet ours can also
have star quakes and a starquake is
exactly what you think it is it&#39;s a 70s
prog rock band um actually it is a band
but it&#39;s also an earthquake on a star in
didja know mix keeley fox talked to us
about the necessity of analyzing the
genomes of indigenous people if you say
in de genomics it&#39;s about investigating
the economies of indigenous people a nam
nikak tur I got to read this to you this
is awesome has to central
counter-rotating coaxial propellers for
thrust and yaw control and three
perimeter mounted variable angle ducted
fans to control roll pitch and provide
lateral forces or you know is just
awesome
so something that&#39;s low fab is locally
fabricated it uses not just local labor
it uses local materials but also local
ideas in innovation so I think it&#39;s
actually thanks to Michael Murphy hi fab
four highly fabulous now aroused about
this was used in fields medal winning
mathematicians Cedric felonies talk I
have to say that because otherwise i
would say a scott wearing mathematician
cedric volantes talk where this was on a
list of bad jobs now roustabout among
other meetings as someone who works in a
circus so circus mathematician i demand
a recount it says something a
personality trait that is Ed igenix is
motivated not by biology or by sociology
or society but it&#39;s motivated by you
needing to accomplish your own hopes and
dreams if you can of course overcome
another word that Brian little used
asshole lick behavior on the parts of
others no nothing is and was used by
Mary Norris it was an error for
know-nothing ism which is in a merican
political party at 1850s that was
conservative an anti-immigration sound
familiar but she suggested using it as a
synonym for nihilism which i think is
great because nihilist get really pissed
off when you create new stuff um and of
course home I love it when Ted speakers
make you think about old words this word
has been an Englishman of 400 years in
new ways and I think that if you feel
like Shonda Rhimes does the hum you are
more likely to achieve your moon shot
which I think was an obligatory word
every speaker had to use the word
moonshot this year so at word Nick we&#39;re
going to add not only these words but
also another million words that are
missing from traditional dictionaries
over the next few months if you see a
word that&#39;s missing that you heard it
Ted please let us know thanks so much
you
