thank you hello everybody
well Africa seems to be the theme so
that&#39;s good I want to tell you about a
miracle something that could make a huge
dent in global nutrition malnutrition
and here&#39;s how billions people eat these
crops and they lack nutrition they don&#39;t
have enough vitamins minerals protein
that&#39;s the bad news here&#39;s the good news
mother nature has an amazing superfood
up her sleeve something that&#39;s been in
front of us all the time
here it is Moringa oleifera the miracle
tree it is the most nutritious plant on
earth what that&#39;s Greg a little thing
you say yes those tiny green leaves
contain a full protein all nine
essential amino acids its unique among
plants it&#39;s really beef without cruelty
look at these comparisons Moringa has
more vitamin A than carrots more iron
than spinach potassium that madonna&#39;s
calcium than milk protein than yogurt
vitamin C than oranges and that&#39;s just
the start of it well I love Moringa
because I started a project with my
friend how are you kubu in this tiny dry
malnourished spot in Ghana and the idea
was to help women grow a crop that they
could sell and that was also nutritious
I&#39;d heard about Moringa and we bought 20
we bought 2 kilos of seeds and these
women agreed to plant them this is
Moringa after 3 months you can see how
fast it grows its drought resistant heat
resistant and it has seven harvests a
year the leaves and the pods added to
soups they&#39;re very nutritious all the
leaves can be dried pounded and made
into powder and this powder can be
stored and eaten stored for the lean
times which is very important
so soon we saw village health improving
and women were telling us that they had
more breast milk less nausea they were
their babies were fitter as you can see
that she&#39;s 2 months old when she&#39;s
weaned that will be all the daily
protein needs she has she will get all
her protein and those three tablespoons
of Moringa we we were hearing all this
news from women but we were also hearing
news from men they were looking for
Moringa and it turns out that erectile
dysfunction has come to the boondocks
and Moringa works like a charm
and I have to tell you I heard this
third hand don&#39;t worry and I didn&#39;t put
up a slide for that and no I do not have
any with me but Moringa is a living
pharmacy it&#39;s its leaves reduce
hypertension it comes from India and ira
vedic medicine knows all about what it
does it&#39;s supposed to cure 300 diseases
and we&#39;ve seen it reduce hypertension
clearly anyway the these women have now
$8,000 in their bank account from the
sale of Moringa that&#39;s food security and
the food that they own that food they
own it and they have the money and they
control it that&#39;s the best part
so Moringa can grow in community gardens
in towns in a bucket on a urban doorstep
and two of these little trees can feed a
family of four with protein so the fact
is why is Moringa not more widely known
that is a mystery I can&#39;t tell you that
why is it not at the forefront of global
hunger reduction strategies well there&#39;s
a lot of literature on it we know a lot
about it and it&#39;s grown in many
countries so when we speak about food
security let&#39;s remember we have this
superb superstar
Moringa is literally a miracle tree and
it&#39;s waiting in the wings to do its part
in reducing world hunger thank you
[Applause]
