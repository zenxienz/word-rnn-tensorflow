this is Ichabod paddock
he is my great-uncle from seven
generations ago and he is responsible
for dramatically changing the face of
the ocean over 300 years ago and his
impact persists today he grew up in Cape
Cod Massachusetts and his brother
Nathaniel my direct ancestor lived in
Nantucket
Ichabod had developed reputation for
being a particularly good hunter of
whales from shore boats and Nathaniel
invited him to visit and teach the
nantucketers how to hunt from boats at
this time nantucketers did not hunt
whales from boats they were sheep
farmers land lovers Ichabod changed
their lives and the rest of history as
Nantucket quickly grew to be the world&#39;s
at the center for whale harvest this
history is a pretty heavy burden for me
to carry
I mean think what it&#39;s like when my
eight-year-old daughters asked dad why
are there so few whales in the ocean and
actually well honey our family helped
kill them all
so through my career in marine
conservation I&#39;ve been trying in a way
to atone for the sins of my ancestors
but ichabod story is more complex than
that
he helped fill a critical and urgent
need for the nantucketers who were
running out of resources on their little
island and whaling helped fuel the
global economy for a time these two
sides of Ichabod&#39;s story helped motivate
how and why my research has changed over
the last ten years as I&#39;ve tried to
understand the state of the planet ocean
as I&#39;ll share with you shortly I also
want to share with you how my research
has changed as I&#39;ve gone from studying
particular places like Nantucket Island
to synthesizing how we are interacting
with an impact in the ocean at the scale
of the whole planet so this is also a
story about how I use big data to
understand the state of planet ocean big
data are everywhere we can use people&#39;s
web searches to track flu outbreaks in
different places around the world at
different times satellite images provide
real-time high-resolution image
of mangroves and salt marshes and beach
dunes globally that we can use to track
habitat destruction and even the stars
above our big data we can use the Stars
to navigate the planet just as the
nantucketers did in their quest for
evermore whales as I sailed across the
Atlantic and in the Pacific but big data
alone don&#39;t have value many of us most
of us can look at the night sky and see
the millions of stars above and beyond
struck and yet we have no clue how to
navigate by them so how can we find
pattern in big data how can we
understand change through time how can
we find meaningful bits of information
amongst all the background noise a lot
of my research has been aimed at
addressing this challenge how can we use
big data to better understand the state
of the ocean and ocean resources and
ultimately how can we use that
understanding to improve the health of
the oceans and the health of the people
that depend on them my colleagues and I
made this map of the world&#39;s oceans in
2008 it contains over a hundred and
thirty billion data points and it
provides a new view of the ocean that
shows us how we are affecting the ocean
it sums up 17 different ways that humans
impact the oceans and it tells us where
where we are having the greatest and
least impact on the ocean it shows us
the biggest hotspots and where are the
last of the nearly pristine oceans to
build this map we assemble global data
on each of these 17 individual
activities here are just a few of them
this is commercial demersal fishing and
then we can add on commercial pelagic
fishing and then on global commercial
shipping and we can continue to layer
these on some of these maps have been
produced before but never had a single
methodology been developed that helped
pull them all together to get this big
picture of how we are affecting the
oceans mapping one thing at a time
misses the big picture the oceans are
crowded with interacting and conflicting
uses the whole is definitely greater
than this
the parts the ola dodge is true don&#39;t
focus on the tree if you want to see the
forest and in fact even to understand
the tree you need to see the forest
these maps changed the view of the ocean
and at the time it was likened to the
sense of Revelation we had the first
time we saw Earth from space and it
catalyzed a new approach to management
that focused on the cumulative impact of
human activities instead of single
activities this map also showed us that
there are no pristine places left on the
planet every single patch of ocean has
been affected by human activities what&#39;s
even more depressing is that 41% of the
ocean has been heavily impacted those
are the yellow orange and red places on
the planet this is remarkable the ocean
is truly vast their place is so remote
it&#39;s hard to fathom their isolation and
yet all 360 million square kilometers of
the ocean has been affected by human
activities but there are places that are
in relatively good shape these blue
places on the map and there are a lot of
them although they represent a
relatively small part of the total ocean
these are the places that give us hope
that show us what the ocean can look
like if we give it the space to thrive
now these maps provide a baseline view
of how we are impacting the ocean and
with this reference point we now have
something to compare against we recently
remade these maps to provide the current
cumulative human impact of the oceans
and this is what we see here and now
with this we can compare it to the
previous map and see how things have
changed to see where things are getting
worse and where things might be getting
better and that&#39;s what we see here the
areas in yellow orange and red are where
things the cumulative impact is
increasing and the places in blue and
green are where it&#39;s decreasing the most
striking result is that a lot of the
ocean is getting worse two thirds of the
ocean has seen an increase in the
cumulative human impact but what was
most surprising to me when we did this
is that there is a
lot of ocean that has had a decrease in
cumulative human impact 13% of it in
fact
that&#39;s nearly 50 million square
kilometres where things are getting
better these places give us hope that
was with concerted action we can improve
the state of the ocean and make things
better so for example if we look at
Germany Denmark and the Netherlands they
all had their cumulative human impact
decrease
despite slight increases in climate
change and pollution impacts and that
because they that&#39;s because they
decreased the impact from commercial
fishing now at first blush this might
seem like a good thing but we don&#39;t know
exactly how they achieve this how the
decrease happen perhaps they just
exported their impact by importing fish
from other places the maps are silent to
these kinds of issues so like I said
these analysis this view of the ocean
changed the way I think about how we are
affecting the oceans and how we do
assessments but it really only focuses
on the negative impact we&#39;re having on
the oceans and yet we gain tremendous
benefit from the oceans whaling
decimated whale populations but it also
fuelled the global economy it Chabad
wasn&#39;t hunting whales because he wanted
to drive a species extinct or destroy
the ocean it was his livelihood a way to
feed his family a part of his identity
so these revelations helped lead me to
the efforts to develop and launch the
ocean health index the index aims to
reframe the discussion about how we
measure the health of the oceans to
focus on the benefits provided as well
as the impacts were having and
policymakers have been asking for this
for years this is what they think of
what their constituents want when they
talk about a healthy ocean but they
didn&#39;t have a tool to measure it to know
whether they were achieving this
objective and the ocean health index
provides such a tool now it does this by
measuring the status of ten benefits
that we want from a healthy ocean things
like food natural products jobs clean
water biodiversity it also tracks the
trends in these benefits the cumulative
impact we have on them and the measures
we take to sustain
and a score of 100 is the best you can
do there&#39;s a lot of things we learned as
we began calculating the index for the
planet over the last few years first in
the last four years the ocean health
index has gone up a point for the planet
now although this isn&#39;t very much this
is pretty remarkable given all of the
doom and gloom stories we hear about the
state of the ocean so what&#39;s going on
there let&#39;s dive in and have a look so
we can expand that single score and so
the ten component pieces that represent
the different benefits that we get from
the ocean health those different bubbles
and I want to focus your attention on
for the coastal livelihoods and
economies the sense of place we get from
lasting special places and iconic
species the tourism and recreation we
get from the ocean and mariculture and
as we track these over the four years
that we&#39;ve assessed it we can see that
coastal livelihoods and economies and
tourism and recreation have gone up a
few points as we&#39;ve continued to recover
from the global recession
we can see on the bottom there that
lower bubble that mariculture has
increased a few points as we&#39;ve
increased the production of sustainable
mariculture this puts more food on our
plates with less damage to the ocean and
finally in the last four years there
have been a lot of protected areas put
into place which helped protect the
places and species that are important to
us as well as provide benefit benefits
across many other measures of the ocean
health index so now let&#39;s look at this
mapped for different countries one of
the immediate things we see is that many
of the remote uninhabited islands are
scoring the highest like Prince Edward
islands in the southern ocean but we
also see that populated places like
Australia are scoring quite high in
particular because they have strong
government and institutions that help
manage their resources sustainably but
how does this happen how do you have
uninhabited places in populated places
both scoring high in the ocean health
index well it all comes down to your
point of reference what you value what
you care about for your particular place
this determines what you assess and how
you assess it so in an uninhabited place
you don&#39;t want thriving coastal
economies there&#39;s no people there you
want thriving biodiversity and clean
water and so you measure against those
objectives but in a populated place you
do want thriving economies you do want
tourism in recreation you do want the
sustainable extraction of natural
resources as long as nature can thrive
as well and so you measure against those
objectives you tailor the assessment to
the place and the values that people
have we also found that there is huge
demand and interest in this kind of tool
in the last three years we&#39;ve seen 22
different countries and regions develop
or are developing their own independent
assessments and there are many more in
the queue there&#39;s clearly a hunger for
this kind of tool to track how we&#39;re
doing
but now let&#39;s put these two worldviews
together we have our negative cumulative
human impact on the oceans on the y-axis
and the benefits we get from the ocean
measured by the ocean health index on
the x-axis each bubble is a country and
they&#39;re color-coded roughly by how
they&#39;re doing we can see some initial
immediate patterns emerging places that
have high cumulative human impact tend
to have low ocean health index scores
places like Lebanon places that have low
cumulative human impact scores tend to
have high ocean health index scores like
New Caledonia
but it&#39;s where these patterns don&#39;t hold
true that it gets particularly
interesting places like Peru where
cumulative human impacts are quite low
but so is the ocean health index what&#39;s
going on there well it turns out that
climate change pollution and commercial
fishing impacts are all relatively low
in Peru and that keeps their cumulative
impact score down but they&#39;ve had a lot
of habitat loss in the last few decades
which affects carbon storage coastal
protection biodiversity many of their
threat of their iconic species are
threatened and they have very few
protected areas in place so Peru is an
example where stronger biodiversity
protection can have dramatic impacts on
the health of the ocean while also
potentially lowering their cumulative
human impact scores in just one more
example here we have northern st.
Maarten in the Caribbean it has
relatively high cumulative impact scores
but also high ocean health index scores
in this case they&#39;re pretty strong
climate change impacts happening there
which is creating overall high
cumulative impacts cool
but they have thriving coastal economies
and tourism and recreation sectors and
they have a lot of protected areas in
place which are helping benefit many
measures of the ocean health but this
view of the world for me is the most
exciting it took me 10 years to be able
to produce this figure so for me this is
my money shot again each bubble is a
country but in this case we have the
change in cumulative human impact on the
xxxx over the last 5 years on the y-axis
over the last 5 years and the change in
ocean health index over the last 4 years
on the x-axis so again we see in the
upper left corner that when cumulative
human impact is increased we see a
decrease in ocean health index scores
that makes sense in the upper right hand
corner we have places that have seen an
increase in cumulative impact but also
an increase in ocean health index scores
what&#39;s going on there we&#39;ll just look at
one example Mozambique here we had a
dramatic increase in the impacts from
climate change which increased the
overall cumulative impact score but they
implemented a large number of protected
areas and they increase the sustainable
harvest of their natural products
natural products like sea shells which
increased their ocean health index
scores but my favorite ones are the ones
in the lower right corner these are the
true success stories or cumulative human
impact decreased and ocean health index
increased and there are nearly 20 other
countries in this region places like the
United States Iceland and the United
Kingdom and also Croatia whether they
had a slight decrease in impacts from
criminal fishing and climate change and
they also implemented a number of
protected areas that had cascading
benefits across the ocean health index I
could go on and on with this kind of
stuff for me this is super fascinating
they&#39;re enormous amounts of data pulled
together synthesized in new ways to
provide novel insights and how we are
affecting the oceans and where and how
we can improve the state of the oceans
and so through all of this I learned a
really important lesson about how we
interact with the oceans for humanity to
thrive we must increase the benefits we
get from the ocean but do so while we
decrease the impacts
this may seem like a lot to ask but it
can happen it already has happened I&#39;ve
shown you that and what&#39;s really
exciting is there&#39;s lots of ways we can
do this we can create marine protected
areas that help biodiversity thrive but
also protect the places and species we
care about we can increase shellfish
aquaculture which puts more food on our
plates while cleaning the water we can
restore coastal habitats which help
absorb carbon dioxide while protecting
our coastlines or coastal property and
our lives we can increase and strengthen
clean water regulations which will help
make for healthier beaches which is good
for marine species and for us we can
implement and strengthen threatened
species regulations which will help
endangered species recover which is good
for them but it&#39;s also good for our
sense of well-being knowing that these
iconic species are recovering and
ultimately thriving so in the end I see
lots of reasons for hope and that&#39;s why
I&#39;m an ocean optimist thank you
