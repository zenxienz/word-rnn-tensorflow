hey everybody um so we in the United
States we&#39;re pretty lucky because we&#39;ve
had a relatively stable democracy with
relatively stable presidents as heads of
state these presidents haven&#39;t put their
own ambition ahead of the country uh
they haven&#39;t taken us into unwarranted
wars they&#39;ve been meeting potatoes men
with a a loving family and a dog by
their side um and because of the
structure of our Constitution we haven&#39;t
had any tyrants of course this guy is
the closest we&#39;ve come but uh being a
tyrant is obviously obviously a problem
because tyrants are tyrannical thank you
that&#39;s the best fight I&#39;ve ever made in
my life and they&#39;re literally cruel and
oppressive by definition um and like I
said you know because of our
Constitution our current president can&#39;t
go full tyrant right he&#39;s more like a
schmuck meets tyrant or what I like to
call a spirit nevertheless violence and
tyrants they share a lot in common like
for example they have no sense of humor
if you take a look at this graph you&#39;ll
this is a Spirent ability to handle a
joke graph obviously the x-axis
represents joke severity 10 being yo
mama&#39;s so fat she&#39;s so fat they use a
crane to take her to work and then one
being yo mama&#39;s so pretty she&#39;s so
pretty they call her beautiful um the
average pirate can&#39;t handle level 10 yo
mama joke they can barely handle level 2
because they have no sense of humor okay
here&#39;s another commonality you know
people always ask me what is our current
president have in common with former
Ayatollah Khomeini I get this question
all the time
and I tell them they both hated the
press right hey to the press we&#39;re all
always trying to get rid of it you&#39;re
losing these two gentlemen share in
common they both wore sort of like loose
and boxy outfits and I suspect it&#39;s
because that&#39;s where they hide the dying
dreams of their people now another
common characteristic of skyress is that
they indulge in impulsive acts right so
for example super Rodney Azov of the
popular vacation destination
Turkmenistan he decided to rename the
days of the week so one Wednesday became
favorable day which is obviously a lie
Saturday became mother a day which
definitely didn&#39;t mean he had an oedipal
complex uh Rafael Trujillo appointed his
three-year-old son as Colonel the
Dominican Republic kim jeong-hoon killed
his brother at an airport and our
current president is killing America
with his tweets now I know that this one
doesn&#39;t seem as bad as the rest but
honestly I&#39;d rather that he like a point
is eleven-year-old son as Colonel than
ever tweet again because his tweets are
killing America okay so we know the
problem but the question is what do we
do I feel like we need to use their
weaknesses against them right and we I
feel like it&#39;s very powerful to have an
undercurrent of mockery in our approach
so with that I developed a few rules of
thumb one never call them by their real
name so the cognitive link was George
Lakoff pointed out that our presidents
name was too triumphant sounding right
he if that could have had a positive
effect on his campaign but if he
switched a couple of letters in it and
in his name it would have been twin and
who can imagine voting for president
wimp right so my proposal to you guys is
instead of calling him by his real name
call him popular vote losing minority
president Donny twit
and if that&#39;s too much named for you
along with my podcast fake the nation
we&#39;ve actually launched Donny crimp calm
it&#39;s an exhaustive database of
alternative names for Donny twin names
like bag of elbows or angry creamsicle
there are literally hundreds of names
choose whichever you want though just
don&#39;t call him by his real name my next
rule of thumb has to do with stereotypes
so Spirent love stereotypes because they
can marshal fear around stereotypes like
Muslims are terrorists or Mexicans or
rapists or women have blood coming out
of their wherever so my role here is to
just change the stereotype so the new
stereotypes are for example Muslims are
totally obsessed with Pop Tarts at the
Marvel um I can attest to that Mexicans
are annoyingly good at astrobiology
women have blood coming out of their ph
sneezes and if you need more stereotypes
I created a Twitter bot that generates
stereotypes everyday stereotypes like
Albanians are really good at sneezing
quietly so repeat these stereotypes
aggressively obliterate the old ones
because these are stereotypes worth
spreading okay I couldn&#39;t help myself
I&#39;m sorry let&#39;s move on to my next rule
of thumb this has to do with the small
borscht Myron&#39;s okay the baby schmeyer
ants who live on social media and
they&#39;re like a mouthpiece for the larger
Myron okay now Mike my role with them is
to flip this script and to illustrate
what I mean by that I&#39;m gonna give you a
little tale from my own life I was
recently on MSNBC because I&#39;m the voice
of a generation and we were there
talking about popular vote losing
minority president on each win and after
their show someone posted on Twitter at
neguin for Saad is clearly the Jewish
nerd on the panel and as a Muslim I was
really flattered because it felt like an
upgrade
I had to clarify I&#39;m actually the Muslim
nerd on the panel and then they
responded sorry but you&#39;re clearly a
jewy mcjewjew
and I thought it was funny that they&#39;d
be so insisted that I be Jewish you know
what I&#39;m sorry I took your anti-semitism
away from you but I feel like
Islamophobia is a really good substitute
but at the same time I am too
sympathetic because sometimes you just
you know you&#39;re like it was late of the
day you know you have to fill your
anti-semitism quota like you&#39;re flipping
through the channels you see a Muslim
and you&#39;re like I already did
Islamophobia you know what I mean and so
you&#39;re like forget it she&#39;s a Jew end of
story
you know and so I get it like if that
happens however I wanted to flip the
script so I responded with a smiley face
emoji because when they go low we go
emoji help the next rule of thumb is is
to hit them in the coin purse now smile
ins really love money and when you
threaten their money that&#39;s when they
feel the most vulnerable
so me and my comedy partner Dean
Obeidallah we decided to launch
something called the boycott bigotry
campaign we&#39;re targeting Donny twins
properties then we&#39;re doing it
regionally we&#39;re starting in Florida
with his golf courses because add this
man sits in the White House golfers are
throwing money at these courses which is
a conflict of interest and by extension
its funding bigotry so we decided to do
shows street actions
drive around billboard trucks take out
ads all over the region and the ad might
look like something like this
the mar-a-lago we&#39;re cascading green
meat xenophobia so this is how we&#39;re
trying to hit him in the coin purse so
okay what have we learned we&#39;ve learned
to never call them by their name flip
the script change the stereotype and for
the love of God stop giving them money
and remember this this isn&#39;t political
this isn&#39;t partisan this is about
justice and above all as we&#39;re doing
these things I think you should do them
with a smile and a wink because when
you&#39;re having a good time
that&#39;s what really sucks a life force
out of a siren
so have fun because they hate that thank
you
[Applause]
