thank you the right to food it protects
us from hunger and malnutrition but
household uses the means to feed
ourselves in dignity these two mean to
me it means that the food that we eat
should be free of any chemicals that
could be harmful to us as well as the
food should ultimately be beneficial to
our health look at this cake it&#39;s a
famous Brazilian cake called bowl of the
tsuba and unless you are Brazilian you
are unlikely to know the ingredients of
this cake so likely you don&#39;t know if
you can eat it do you have some ology
that may cause a problem by eating this
cake well the reality is that we are all
different some food is good for us and
some food is not and this is for each of
every one of us we have different food
sensitivities and different health
concerns and I have a show a story now
to tell you about my daughter a personal
story my daughter when she was 13
she developed chronic hives and judi
mass chronic fatigue tremors sensitivity
to light and she was bedridden for eight
months as doctors could not decide what
was the actual diagnose for this
horrible illness chronic illness I took
upon myself to look into it and to work
through it it took as many months
many rooms we waited patiently to see
doctors and many men of actually doing
intravenous injections just to keep her
alive and in those rooms I met several
people as many as year people that had
and diagnose illnesses people that were
waiting for an answer why they had this
chronic illness
fortunately to my daughter she was
finally diagnosed and the cause of her
chronic illness was actually a severe
under allergy to penicillin as well as
some other allergies to gluten to
titanium dioxide to food dyes and a mild
intolerance to glucose these diagonals
was truly empowering and life-saving but
it took one year and she lost one year
of a school year it became very hard for
us to understand what was in the food
what could be feeder what could she eat
and not break up into this severe hive
and so with my background in technology
and the help of my company we started
thinking about a device that could scan
a cake like this scan any food in your
dish in your plate and give you the
information of what exactly is in that
food and this is what my team and I have
been developing so I present to you our
first beta prototype it&#39;s a working beta
prototype I will be diminutive a it&#39;s
called the Telfair food sensor but
before I go there I want to explain a
little bit of the science so that you
don&#39;t think it&#39;s magical because it&#39;s
not magical and it&#39;s really sometimes it
is existed for quite a few years it&#39;s
based on spectroscopy so basically as
you see the scanner itself is a
spectrometer and it works with the phone
and with the algorithms in the cloud you
scan the food by throwing lights at the
particles in the food and this particles
vibrate by absorbing energy and reflect
back those photons the spectrometer
inside a scanner simply counts and sort
those photons the graph that we obtain
on it is number of photons their way of
length
that graph spectrum is unique to each
food so each food has its own
fingerprints that information is sent
via bluetooth to the phone and the phone
sends it to the cloud and in the cloud
we have several algorithms learning
algorithms chemometric algorithms are
written that essentially the compose
that spectrum into the different
ingredients we then store the
information that users send to us for
future use of the user and send back
that information into the phone all
these in three seconds or less this is
what essentially you would see on your
phone the number of calories
carbohydrates proteins fats and you can
also learn about these ingredients by
looking at our tells pekka pedia and
Wikipedia of ingredients and health
concerns thank you my team deserves that
applause not me they have been working
night and day to get me to get me here
anyway one unique characteristic about
our food data engine is that every time
someone scans the food we store it in
our database and we learn better and our
algorithms become more accurate so
essentially this is actually a
crowdsourcing project a community
project a project for the people by the
people and we are currently we have more
than one quarter million scans in our
data bank but those are growing actually
very fast about a thousand a week but
this is only a scratch of what we need
in terms of delivering our vision so we
building the first-ever global spectral
database of food ingredients we are
going where no man has gone before
and for those turkeys we are not there
we will be there but we&#39;re not there as
you see our scanner is still quite large
and fast
it&#39;s kind of like a daily tailsbag
scanner it&#39;s not exactly what you carry
in the in a jacket or in a purse so we
are actively miniaturizing it and our
scans a quarter of a million not that
many but we believe that in the next
five years we&#39;ll have scanned enough to
be able to actually have they go to the
text at least 80% of the food consumed
worldwide now let me show you all these
foot scanner actually works okay so I&#39;m
going to tack the cake here I&#39;m not
going to eat it and just going to make
sure that my scanner is connected here
too and you know being of age when it
glasses and now very simple I am
throwing some light at the food and so
the practicals are turning now to the
scanner and we have a spectrum here on
this phone this is all the tooth done
and now on my other phone it does give
me a second I have to open it our app we
should be able to see the information
about this cake so can you see the
information about this cake now
well it&#39;s important you see it it&#39;s
important you film it because and I&#39;m
going to give you some information can
you see this
yes okay there is the fat the cow is a
carbohydrate and here&#39;s the different
ingredients but what I really want to
show you is that you will see glucose
frutos maltose and sucrose
okay now likely I was so sure the recipe
for death cake does not involve glucose
I&#39;m not seeing any cook we can ask the
previous speaker putting glucose in a
cake but we have glucose and fructose
and likely the recipes in cost for that
but when sucrose is baked it breaks down
in photos and glucose and for someone
like my daughter she got a void of cake
now I&#39;m giving you this information
because we truly are going beyond the
label one thing is to tell you I put in
sucrose another thing is to say you&#39;re
eating through clothes ok so this is one
thing that we are trying to do in order
to really give understanding to people
we also believe that the foods and data
that we gather can be gathered into what
we call a food print these are foot
print and it describes what people are
eating through the world and what
they&#39;re consuming and how they are
consuming process is changing these
information couples and correlated with
their bio information the information
how they feel and their health and their
genome and their epigenome is going to
be able to finally give data to
scientists to study the importance of
diet in the prevention of diseases and
not only that we&#39;re going to be able to
actually teach people what food they
should eat and ideally be able to
contribute to the disappearance of
epidemics such as obesity when people
understand what they eat and understand
what they put in their mouth they start
being able to change that information is
yet to be available to us because it&#39;s
not available relevant when we are
eating but it&#39;s now becoming
democratized so what we hope to do is
really to be able to provide information
beyond the label to encourage
accountability for produce farming as
well as food manufacturing while
educating the consumer in the
implications of the ingredient that they
eat and their wellness we also want to
make our database of food database of
information on the different ingredients
and our engine our food analysis engine
available to everybody everywhere
independent of the scanner we believe
that this scanner eventually will be
totally integrated in a phone and so we
are encouraging people to come in use
our technology to develop better ways to
improve human health and rills a greener
future it&#39;s a very ambitious project but
one that the world needs badly thank you
thank you thank you thank you so what up
thank you
