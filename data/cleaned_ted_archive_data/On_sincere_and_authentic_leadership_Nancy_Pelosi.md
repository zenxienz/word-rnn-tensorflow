I like that was am i right about the
four heartbeats away aren&#39;t you well of
what one you said that I&#39;m the most
powerful elected woman in American
history I know we&#39;re not talking
politics today but not for long you have
in yours long and political career
observed women leaders and been a women
leader and what we could benefit so
greatly from now when we hear stories
like holla share as you wonderful what
is the case we make for women&#39;s
leadership and why it&#39;s so needed and
whites and how it&#39;s different well first
of all let me assess humbly and
respectfully associate myself with
Hollis remarks wasn&#39;t she wonderful
and and Thank You Pat anytime Pat calls
we all follow because she&#39;s been such a
leader on all of these issues and you&#39;re
a role model to many of us as well when
people when I was Speaker and as leader
but especially a speaker because that&#39;s
really the second most powerful position
in our country people would say to me
after meetings do you realize how
different this meeting is then it had
that been conducted by a man and I think
that&#39;s because women are intuitive of
women are respectful of other views
women listen women learn but women are
ready to use their time well and I think
this is about time so I always say to
women know your power when you set out
on a course be sure of your purpose and
your vision as to what you want to
achieve know your subject so that you
have judgment that is respected have a
plan think strategically if you do all
of these things you will attract support
but if you do all these things you will
also use your intuition
to act and acting in terms of relating
it to time when people know that you are
going to act instead of delay or to
think about it more or whatever we don&#39;t
want you to be hasty but we want you be
deliberative when people know that women
have confidence in their vision their
knowledge their judgment and the plan
that they have to get the job done
and that they&#39;re going to act their
leadership will be very very respected
and people will not try to destroy your
options while you take more time so know
your power be sure of your convictions
and act upon them don&#39;t waste any time
giving other people a chance to
undermine your vision your knowledge
your judgment your values in any
decision such good advice and I was
thinking how great it you&#39;re
interrupting the Speaker of the House
she has just a few things to do today
can you imagine taking time out in the
middle of what we all know is an
historic campaign and so I&#39;ll just move
my earring somebody&#39;s talking to Carol
I&#39;ll talk about her here with that yeah
yes I had to take mine off too
as these mics don&#39;t go for it I am I say
this is a woman thing because every
speaker is said I have to leave lose my
earrings so I was his talent was talking
I think about this a lot as Helen was
talking we do need those role models and
when you decided to run for your first
elected office there weren&#39;t as
many for you and all the challenges that
still exist for women must have been 10
fold for you Nancy what got you through
and made you believe that leadership was
possible for you well I was not on a
course I did not my daughter Christina&#39;s
here with me she was in college at the
time as she can attest that I was a mom
you know I and the opportunity to run
for Congress came along but I had not
thought in terms of it of the rest but I
had a purpose I had volunteered in the
community
I knew my purpose I knew my call to
service was about children I had five
children so I thought my role in the
public arena was to expand my role as
mom to make sure that all children had
the same wonderful opportunity that my
children did that was a service to those
children and to mine so in terms of
women the woman who was the member of
Congress at the time was a woman named
Salwa Burton she was a wonderful
wonderful person and she took ill and
she said to me you must run you will
love this you love the issues you must
run and I said well I&#39;ve never even
thought of running for office I&#39;m shy I
don&#39;t like the being the one in front I
was the chair of the California
Democratic Party so I loved the values
of our party and promoting women in the
rest but not me and so in any event I
was ready because I knew my purpose I
had studied the issues again as I said
to you and I thought I think I can get
this done but in terms of role models
this is what I would say it&#39;s wonderful
to have mentors and to be role models
but Hollow said something very value you
must be your authentic self it&#39;s nice to
say Oh so-and-so I admire her this or
that that&#39;s good but you are the
sincerely authentic person and people
want to see authenticity in their
candidates Haleh said something else
about civility etc and money in
campaigns I truly believe that we will
turn everything upside down in terms of
women&#39;s participation in leadership
government and politics if we reduce the
role of money in politics
and increase the level of civility
increase the level of civility that&#39;s
more of an arena where women will be
comfortable it&#39;s a service to the
country this is not for the faint of
heart this is not for the faint of heart
and that&#39;s why I was cheering how it
back this is this is strong this is
tough it&#39;s it&#39;s but it&#39;s worth it
because nothing is more wholesome to a
government in any country but talking
about our own nothing is more wholesome
to a government to the political arena
or to any endeavor than the increased
participation of women and and
leadership of women I truly believe that
one of our UK speakers Sandi Toksvig
reminded us yesterday and a really
wonderfully funny but very meaningful
talk said that the problem is women get
elected to office and we all have high
expectations for them to address gender
issues right away but often they don&#39;t
have time because they&#39;re too busy
cleaning up the mess the boys well I
would say this when I first started to
people came to me and said you should
run for leadership and I thought you
know I love my issues that I&#39;m working
on here and so but we had many more
women because that was a decision we
made to elect many more women to
Congress and women were urging me to run
as for others so then when I said that I
would run for leadership but the men
said who said she could run poor babies
babies who said she could run then they
saw there&#39;s so many women were
supporting me and they said why don&#39;t
you make a list of all the things you&#39;d
like to see different done differently
and we all do them for you oh poor
babies again so and they said what&#39;s not
your turn I&#39;ve been waiting over 200
years you&#39;ve had your peck
it is it is a lot of it is about time
the most valuable commodity it&#39;s finite
and how we use it and how long it&#39;s
taken us to do things from the time of
the Seneca Falls conference the
convention where women set out to get
the right to vote worked hard struggled
starved marched that arrested all the
rest when finally the amendment passed
the headline said women given the right
to vote no not given fought for
struggled achieved and then all these
years later now we still don&#39;t have a
direct proportion of women in the
Congress or in other elected bodies as
we have in our population but that will
change because because I because of the
public awareness I always like to tell
the story of relating to Seneca Falls is
when I went for my first meeting as a
member of the leadership and by the way
the response I got across the country
was quite remarkable because who pays
attention to leadership races in the
Congress well people do and fathers of
daughters sent letters saying thank you
for opening another door for my daughter
so I was very of course I heard from the
women young women older women I never
thought I&#39;d see the day etc but in May I
go into my first meeting at the White
House
I wasn&#39;t intimidated about going to
meeting the White House have been
appropriator and intelligence this or
that committee but when I went into the
door of this meeting first leadership
meeting with the president the vice
president and the other leaders
bipartisan as well close behind me I
realized that this was unlike any other
meeting I had ever attended at the White
House in fact it was unlike any meeting
any woman had ever attended at the White
House it wasn&#39;t a cabinet officer which
is a wonderful thing to be but your
presence is derived from the man at the
head of the table I was there elected by
my colleagues to represent them in that
meeting so it&#39;s different and as I sat
down a president Bush was president
always gracious lovely welcoming saying
some nice things I said
it closed in my chair it was like I have
just I was weird it was so tight and
then I realized that on that chair susan
b anthony Elizabeth Cady Stanton
Lucretia Mott Maude Alice Paul serger
nerd truth they were all in that chair
with me I do it they were and then I
could hear them say at last we have a
seat at the table and then they were
gone but imagine standing on the
shoulders of those courageous that word
that how they hollow used courage
courageous women and then realizing that
others will be standing on our shoulders
and some of you are here so know your
own power
be your authentic self use your time
that finite quality to be ready when the
time comes and hopefully I always say
for some people it seems inconceivable
to others it is inevitable
that&#39;s just short in the distance the
time between the unconceivable and the
inevitable that we will have many more
women in power and soon leader blessing
we all are we we hope you&#39;re right and
we believe you will be in part of why we
hope you&#39;re right
is that these are perilous and dangerous
times over the period of time we&#39;ve been
together and dead women we&#39;ve talked
about many of the issues that are so
much about a globally engaged
conversation going on now about race
about gender about violence about
immigration about hate crimes all the
things that we see in the newspaper
every day that make us long for a
different kind of leadership if you had
all the power in the world we&#39;d give it
to you by the way if you had absolute
power what would you do now as a leader
but how about that well here&#39;s the thing
no one has all the power in the world
and that&#39;s the beauty of democracies and
the rest and the and the part of it all
is is to know your values be driven act
upon them be driven by them but part of
your value system has to be respectful
of other views as well they in terms of
the role of government the timing of of
change and the rest of it and the there
is absolutely no question in my mind if
that we had many many more women in
power not just for what we would call
the women&#39;s issues but about our
national security about our economic
security about the strength of our
countries in terms of values in ways
that are enlargements of issues that we
talked about health care and education
and issues that relate to children
they&#39;re very important we take
responsibility for a woman&#39;s right to
choose and the rest of that but it&#39;s all
part of something bigger it&#39;s about
creating a government and societies that
are respectful of the voices of the
people in their countries in it I always
quote st. Augustine who as he is quoted
by Pope Benedict and Saint Agustin said
17th centuries ago he said any
government that is not formed to promote
justice for the people is just a bunch
of Thieves 17th centuries ago and saying
Agustin said that Pope Benedict followed
up by saying well what is hard is to
define what justice is but in doing so
we must beware of the blinding light of
money and special interest so it takes
us to Toynbee join be said in this study
of civilization the civilizations emerge
countries emerge and there are two paths
one could be a path of an
lete that there will be elites who will
cover and that&#39;s what you know people
emerge an elite that is there for the
common good
or an elite that is there for the
special interest and some countries just
take their path in other countries this
is a conflict and where this conflict is
causes a schism in the soul of the
country so when we talk about a woman in
power anyone empower recognizing that it
is about the will of the people the
well-being of the people and to use time
well to listen understand their
frustrations but also be ready to use
your time to make decisions that people
will respect I would take it to another
place in President Washington when he
left office he said he cautioned against
political parties that were at war with
their own government so we have to again
in our own country respect the vision of
our founders which was so remarkable and
thank heavens they made our sacred
documents amendable so there could be
even more remarkable we have to respect
and understand the responsibility of our
men and women in uniform who protect our
country
and secure our country and our democracy
and we have to be true to the
aspirations of our children to make the
future better for them but I would say
if there was one words that I would use
to answer your question it&#39;s about
respect respect for people respect for
your responsibilities faith in the
future and I think that&#39;s on the horizon
I would like to say on behalf of this
audience and grateful men and women
everywhere in this country and around
the world for the way in which you have
modeled yourself as a woman leader and
the way in which you have led for women
thank you I thank you very much I didn&#39;t
get around to paid family leave we&#39;re
talking about that way
[Applause]
