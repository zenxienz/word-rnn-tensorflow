thoughtful visualizations have the power
to impact science by helping researchers
to untangle complex questions questions
like how do you compare a human and a
lizard my collaborator meant red Greb
hair is tackling this question by
comparing the human genome with that as
a lizard and looking for regions of
similarity between the two ultimately he
hopes these sorts of comparisons will
shed light on how our own genome encodes
who we are now when men Fred and I
started working together he was
struggling to make sense of his
computational results using
off-the-shelf visualization tools like
this one now in this plot we&#39;re looking
at one human chromosome against one
chromosome from that of the lizard and
each one of those dots inside of the
plot indicates the location of sequence
similarity in these two chromosomes but
now for men Fred to actually look across
his full data set he had to look at many
of these plots in fact his whole data
set was producing over 300 of them now
not only were these plots unintuitive
and overwhelming but they also masked
some critical subtleties in his
computational results now he and I work
together for several months to design a
new interactive visualization tool
called ms be here I&#39;m showing you just
one part of that tool ms lee is designed
to support data like Manfred&#39;s data that
is complex that&#39;s multi-dimensional and
multiscale and was the first tool to
fully support this type of comparative
genomics data now in this view in the
outer ring we&#39;re looking at the human
genome and on the inner ring we&#39;re
looking at that as a lizard the inner
ring also contains one user selected
chromosome from that outer ring that has
been emanating a set of colored lines
and each one of those lines represents a
region of similarity between the two
genomes
now using ms be scientists can quickly
explore their complete data sets and
build an intuition about the information
contained therein this is actually a
screenshot of the very first data sets
that man Fred loaded intimacy now by
some measures this is a relatively
aesthetic image there&#39;s lots of colors
and their circles everyone seems to love
circles but for men Fred this image was
both shocking and disappointing because
what he saw was very ugly messy data he
actually had no idea that his theory was
producing so much noise that there were
so many lines going to different places
and this went against what he knew to be
biologically true and had been all but
hidden in those dot plots so he went
back and spent a couple of weeks
tweaking things in his theory and he was
able to get but this far at this point
he scrapped his theory decided to take a
new approach and that new theory that
came out of that gave him this data set
now he&#39;s since gone on to publish his
results and to release his software out
into the scientific community I asked
him how long it would have taken them to
make this breakthrough using the methods
he had available to him prior to ms be
what he told me was honestly I don&#39;t
think I would have ever gotten here now
visualization tools like ms bean are
actually a relatively simple outcome of
a much more complex than messy process
designing visualizations for scientists
is more than just about creating images
it&#39;s actually about under start
acquiring a deep understanding of their
problems of their questions and also of
their mental models and it turns out
that all the hard work happens long
before you write a single line of code
but when done well these visualizations
have the power to not just support the
scientists but to also influence them
what to do so we have to move beyond
thinking that visualization is just
about pretty pictures and to instead
embrace that it is really about a deep
investigation
in the sense-making thank you
