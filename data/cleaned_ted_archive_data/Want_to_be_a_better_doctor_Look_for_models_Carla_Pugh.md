my biggest dream is that one day the
medical profession would completely
change how they measure physician
performance the current gold standard is
a pencil and paper test and this is what
we call a high-stakes examination and
what this means is that if you don&#39;t
pass the test you don&#39;t get a
certificate and you don&#39;t get to
practice medicine and this sort of sets
the tone for how physicians are measured
in the medical field what&#39;s a little
nuanced about the whole thing is that if
you get a really high score
no one cares no one gives you a
certificate of excellence or a gold
medal that distinguishes you from the
person who barely passed now compare and
contrast this with athletics this is a
profession where testing and performance
metrics are used to set personal goals
and that data is constantly used for you
to have information so that you can
achieve your personal best be the best
that you can be and my job I work as a
surgeon and I also work as a researcher
and we use sensors and motion tracking
technology to design new tests and
performance metrics and our goal is to
help doctors to be the best that they
can be so take an intubation procedure
for example this is a procedure that&#39;s
done when you&#39;re going to have a major
operation and we have to put you to
sleep under general anesthesia and the
anesthesiologist you see in this picture
in his left hand he has a laryngoscope
in his right hand he has an endotracheal
tube and that&#39;s the tube that we connect
to the ventilator that helps to breathe
for you
getting his tube inside of a patient
requires a high level of skill so what
we did was build a simulator that has
sensors in the airway and there are
sensors in places where the tube should
go but we also put sensors in places
where the tube shouldn&#39;t go so that we
know if you made a mistake this next
graft is really a sensor output and what
you see here are all the different
colors represent a different area of the
anatomy within the simulator and the
graph shows the amount of pressure
that&#39;s applied in each of those
anatomical areas over time the one you
want to look at is the dark red or dark
brown area which is a sensor that&#39;s on
the tongue and that actually shows us
how many times the clinician is
manipulating the laryngoscope in the
airway
the dark blue sensor is a sensor that&#39;s
on the vocal cords and that&#39;s the
Gateway to the airway the lungs and the
trachea and when you look at this this
is actually a perfect intubation this is
a really experience a clinician he got
the tube in in 12 seconds the patient
did very well this person took about
three times as long and what you can see
there&#39;s a lot more sensors and a lot
more squiggly lines going on on the
screen because they&#39;re touching other
things that tease the airway and
sometimes patients actually do get
injured when this happens so what I&#39;m
excited about is that I have detailed
performance data for this physician and
I can tell them exactly what they need
to do the next time to improve we built
a similar simulator for the breast exam
and the question we raised with this one
because the breast exam is very
different you can use all a number of
hanji one and you have unlimited degrees
of freedom we wanted to know if the
sensors could tell the difference
between the two most common patterns
that are used to explore a breast tissue
when you&#39;re palpating one of the most
common ones is the linear strip method
where you just go up and down across the
chest on the tissue systematically so
you don&#39;t miss a lesion the other one is
a circular method where you goes circle
by circle and feel all the tissue and
what we found was that there&#39;s a big
difference when you look at the graph on
the top that&#39;s the linear strip method
and the way to tell there&#39;s a difference
if you focus on the yellow sensor that&#39;s
the one that&#39;s in the center of the
breast and you past that area multiple
times when you&#39;re doing the exam or if
you&#39;re doing this circular map that you
start in the center
and you see the yellow sensors there but
you don&#39;t see them at the end of the
exam this was really exciting because
now we know that the sensor technology
can not only tell the difference between
novices and experts but it can also give
us detailed information about the
specific technique that doctors are
using when they&#39;re doing their clinical
examinations so I have a video one of
them is the circular technique on your
left side and on the right side as the
linear strip method the bottom part of
the screen is our sensor map so we can
show on here exactly what technique you
so the doctors are using and this really
helps us to understand their technique
and then if their skills aren&#39;t that
great then we know exactly where to give
them feedback I have to last when I look
at this because no one will ever forget
to put a glove on when they&#39;re doing
this examination so this test when we
built a simulator this one is for the
rectal exam and for the prostate exam so
you&#39;ve got two organs for the males that
are giving this exam and this is really
important because people can get cancer
and you want your doctor to be excellent
if they&#39;re gonna do this exam on you
what we found was very interesting is
that some of the medical students do a
better exam that some of our highly
trained specialists and we were very
surprised we took this to several
specialists and what we found is that
some of the specialists nowadays don&#39;t
do a complete examination anymore so
that was very helpful for us to inform
doctors that if you&#39;re sending your
patient to a specialist some of them
don&#39;t do a complete exam one of our
other studies we did we use for breast
models with 500 physicians and different
specialties and what we found is that
some of the physicians are fabulous they
do excellent breast exams and we even
categorize them as the Olympians because
some of them are really really good on
the other hand there are about 15% of
these physicians that actually don&#39;t
even apply enough pressure to feel a
lesion and this was somewhat alarming
cuz they all had about 20 years in
practice so we&#39;re excited that we&#39;re
using technology that can actually help
us improve our performance in the
medical profession in our lab we
strongly believe that engineering
technology can help improve human
performance and we believe that if you
give somewhat detailed performance data
and feedback about what they&#39;re doing
you can really help them to be the best
they can be
what&#39;s interesting is we&#39;re doing this
in an era where everything is so Pro
technology and we&#39;re constantly seeking
ways to develop and invent robots that
can actually do what humans do or take
over human tasks and a sort of
interesting we really marvel at this
technology and its really really cool
and a lot of it&#39;s very exciting our
direction is actually using the
technology to show how exciting and how
great human beings can be thank you
[Applause]
thank you so much that was absolutely
fantastic I have one question for you
yes so with your innovative ways to test
performance what do you think medicine
will look like in 2035 Wow
well that excites me I actually believe
everything will be pretty automated I
always imagine an operating room or any
of our clinical areas where I know that
I&#39;m actually a pretty good surgeon and
what I&#39;m doing but I know that there&#39;s
someone that&#39;s door to me who&#39;s doing
one part better than I am I would like
to have that data automatically look
you&#39;re doing this and you&#39;re doing it
that way but so and so does it this way
and it&#39;s faster or it&#39;s better that&#39;s
what I would like automated feedback
that&#39;s fantastic thank you so much
[Applause]
