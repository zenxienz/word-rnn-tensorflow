if it is easy I create languages for a
living and often people ask me you know
what exactly is entailed in creating a
language well potentially it could be as
simple as this you start right here and
then you just basically open that bad
boy up and start coining words for every
single possible entry so assuming you
got as far as the O&#39;s you might decide
that the new word for oscillation is
gloom and the new word for octagon is
yard Lowell the new word for octave is
build Coug and then since they&#39;re really
cute and cuddly the new word for Ocelot
is give Maya onion or something like
that anyway once you had enough of these
words you could put together sentences
like this one means he lose poverty get
media smiley on yani which means word
for word the child plays with the
ocelots and of course if you wanted to
be clever you could take this suffix
here that corresponds to the s in
English and move it to the front of the
word and after you&#39;ve done that you will
have created the most obnoxious way to
speak the English language ever so
anyway what&#39;s wrong with this
potentially nothing if you just want
like you know a secret way of speaking
English that&#39;s fine
that&#39;ll do it all depends on the goals
that one sets for oneself in creating a
language one such goal in the modern era
of language creation or con langing
remember that term is naturalism a
naturalistic language is one that
attempts as nearly as possible to
imitate the quirks and idiosyncrasies of
natural language in order to do that
Cohn wingers have learned a lot from
historical linguistics and linguistic
typology and pidgin and creole languages
the language is what they do is they
change over a long period of time in the
mouths of billions and billions of
speakers and what we have to do when
we&#39;re creating a naturalistic language
is emulate that evolution and here&#39;s an
example of the type of evolution I&#39;m
talking about the following quote comes
from the morte d&#39;Arthur by Thomas Malory
written in English in the fifteenth
century
couldn&#39;t hear obviously and that Epona&#39;s
otro down in a swoon and certainly a
great while and when she might speak she
said but no spoilers you got to go read
it anyway I want to draw your attention
to the word might there it doesn&#39;t mean
quite what it does nowadays now it means
kind of like be allowed to what it means
here though is really was able to that
is she fell down she fainted and when
she was able to speak when she had the
physical capacity to speak
she spoke right well it turns out that&#39;s
actually what that word used to me
so starting way back in
proto-indo-european we have this word
mob which meant to have power or to be
powerful and as the language evolved
into proto-germanic we got this word
maghen on which means to be able to much
like our word Kanda&#39;s nowadays but as
neil evolution kept going we got may
which means be allowed to with can
taking over the former function that may
have but of course you know this is
basically what languages do they kind of
the means drift bit by bit new speakers
reanalyze old forms of a language and
they kind of change and you produce a
brand new version the artistry of
naturalistic language creation comes in
simulating and guiding this evolution to
produce naturalistic but novel results
so here&#39;s an example what you could do
with just two words so here&#39;s this
language it&#39;s got nothing else it just
has these two words eat and fit well one
thing you could do even with just those
two words you can introduce
sequentiality so you can have for
example eat versus sit and eat and if
the latter construction got used over a
long period of time it might grammatical
eyes a little bit and produce something
like being in the process of eating and
having just finished eating and then a
couple of sound changes later pretty
soon you have the beginning of a verbal
paradigm one that distinguishes what we
call the perfective versus the
imperfective aspect if you go into the
lexicon you can have even more fun with
the language and casteth in the language
I developed for Syfy&#39;s defiance
I used linguistic evolution
as a characterization tool as a way of
basically giving insight into the
history of the speakers so for example
we have these two words that mean to
fail and to raise in the modern version
of the language they actually derive
from older words that mean to try and to
repair focusing on just the first one
cheville ooh the idea of trying
something allows for the possibility of
failure for example I&#39;m going to try to
get this talk under six minutes and I&#39;m
going to fail miserably so it&#39;s illicit
you could say that you could try
something and then fail you can&#39;t say I
accomplished it but I fail to do so does
make any sense so what happened was as
this word was used over the centuries
the idea of try became de-emphasized in
this lexing until eventually it was just
replaced entirely and all it was less in
its wake was failure in Dothraki a
language I developed for HBO&#39;s Game of
Thrones I used different conceptual
metaphors from what an english-speaking
viewer might be used to for example
trees are conceptualized as torsos being
buried in the soil so with that idea the
great fig leafy part of the tree is the
head that is the same word for head and
Dothraki is used for that leafy part of
the tree which means of course that the
trunk is not a metaphor for the body but
the neck right and of course the throat
of the tree produces like I don&#39;t even
know if we have a word for this in
English but it&#39;s the middle the inside
of the trunk right and then of course
everything below ground the root system
of the tree is the lungs anyway so why
go to all this trouble when real EXIF
eyeing the English language would be so
simple more and more I think the
entertainment 3 entertainment industry
has an answer films and television shows
are being analyzed by legions of fans
the world over now and in real time
every single detail of a production is
analyzing depths by amateurs and experts
alike and the results are shared
instantaneously let me show you just a
quick example this is my wife Erin
sitting on the Iron Throne from Game of
Thrones and you know it looks pretty
great from far
back and it looks great on screen if you
get up close though it&#39;s easy to see
that it&#39;s fake but that doesn&#39;t matter
the greatest level of interaction that a
fan will ever have with this object is
seeing it on screen well what about a
language though a language never gets
more real than when we speak it if it&#39;s
used in a television show or a film
anybody can sit there write down what&#39;s
said and analyze it to see if it&#39;s
systematic or if it&#39;s just gibberish
advanced Anik like you could pause the
show step into a scene and actually
touch the Iron Throne if it&#39;s actually
made out of melted swords or not that&#39;s
basically what we have with language
unfortunately there is no staged version
of a language to create an authentic
sounding language one needs to employ an
authentic methodology because is it
thank you
