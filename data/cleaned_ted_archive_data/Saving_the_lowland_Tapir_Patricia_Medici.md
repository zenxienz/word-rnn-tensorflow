papers are large wide-ranging mammals
that live mostly in tropical forests and
I love them I think they&#39;re the most
amazing animals on the face of earth
this is a baby tapir the cutest animal
offspring in the animal kingdom they&#39;re
born like this full of stripes and spots
just like a little watermelon it&#39;s
really really sad that they lose this
pattern when they grow there are four
species of safer&#39;s in the world the
lowland tapir throughout South America
the Central American tapir in Central
America the mountain tapir in the
mountains of Colombia Ecuador and Peru
and the Malayan tapir in Southeast Asia
I work with the lowland tapir
when I started my project in 1996 that
was just a small research project that
quickly took over my life and became a
long-term nationwide conservation
initiative the lowland tapir is the
largest terrestrial mammal of South
America adults can weigh up to 300 kilos
that&#39;s about half the size of a horse
they&#39;re stronger and bigger than Jaguars
and Pumas diapers are mostly found in
tropical forests such as the Amazon they
are closely associated with water which
they used to drink to thermoregulate
when it gets really hot and sometimes
they even copulate in the water
tapirs are nocturnal they&#39;re solitary
and they have this amazing flexible a
snout that they use to grab their food
and speaking of food they&#39;re herbivores
about 50% of their diet consists of
fruit but here&#39;s the problem papers are
threatened with extinction and the main
threats they face are devastation
hunting mostly for their meat and their
skin and roadkill which is a huge
problem in some parts of Brazil
in addition papers reproduce very very
slowly they produce a single watermelon
baby after a very long gestation period
of 13 14 months well this means that if
a tapir population is impacted by let&#39;s
say roadkill and suffers a severe
decline in number of individuals it&#39;s
quite unlikely that population will ever
recover to make it worse tapirs have to
deal with the huge PR problem here in
Brazil
Brazilians know about that first
nobody knows most people don&#39;t know what
a tapir is most people mix them up with
giant anteaters that is not a tapir and
second here the people who do know what
a tapir is they associate these animals
with a lack of intelligence here in
Brazil if you want to call someone
stupid you call that person a tapir it&#39;s
the equivalent of jackass in English and
this is something we absolutely have to
change the belief that tapirs lack
intelligence that they are stupid
animals it&#39;s it&#39;s it makes Brazilians
not to have pride for tapirs we&#39;re not
proud for this animal and this is really
something we have to change the lack of
something else that is very important is
that that I have to say that the tapirs
their their importance is far bigger
than the species itself they&#39;re way much
more important far much more important
than you might expect
papers are widely recognized as umbrella
species umbrella species is a species
that requires large areas and they share
that habitat with many other animals
such as peccaries and deer and Jaguars
and Puma birds insects if you protect
tapirs you will most certainly help
protect all those other animals
in addition papers are known as
Gardeners of the forest when they eat
fruit they swallow the seeds which they
disperse throughout their habitat
through their feces and that they play a
major major role in shaping and mane
painting the diversity and the structure
of their habitat it is the fact that the
extinction of tapers would seriously
impact biodiversity as a whole
scientific research has always been a
major part of what I do the main focus
of my work but it&#39;s also very very
important to promote awareness about the
tapir conservation cause and here&#39;s what
I need your help
now you know what a tapir is you know
where they live you know the threats
they face you know how important they
are so please get out there and help me
spread the word please help me speak on
behalf of tapirs they&#39;re way too
important to go extinct thank you so
much
