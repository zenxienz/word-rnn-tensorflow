I don&#39;t have to repeat my first name to
you do I
let me begin by telling you a story I
like to ask you a question but before I
ask you the question I would like to
give you the city scenario that the
question is based on and I&#39;ll pinpoint a
couple of people to give me an answer to
the question and we continue with the
story imagine it just completed your
high school your parents decided for one
reason or another we&#39;re going to United
States so you prepare yourself with
excitement possibility the unknown and
with 50 dollars in your pocket you&#39;re
set on the plane don&#39;t you think my
parents are generous you arrived in the
United States immediately you&#39;ll find a
job because you want to make your dream
of going to college a reality so you get
a job six months later you get informed
that you have to file for your taxes and
in addition there may be a possibility
that you will get some of the you money
back from the government where you come
from that&#39;s a new concept
the government says your money they
don&#39;t give it back so you have to go to
a tax preparer you make an appointment
you go there and you&#39;re trying to
chitchat because you have been told that
Americans like to chitchat and they&#39;re
very friendly in the middle of the
chitchat your tax preparer says get out
of here what would be your response let
me see the guy&#39;s an amazed can you can
you can you tell me what would be your
response please I can&#39;t see your name
because the light
the one was touching the budge you&#39;re
going like this no right here yeah okay
thank you David ma&#39;am over there with
the brown or burgundy sweater yes yes
very good indeed this was a true story
24 years ago when I moved to the United
States that&#39;s exactly what happened to
me let me tell you what my response was
I started bawling out to the door I grew
up in a high altitude city of Addis
Ababa Ethiopia and running was my
natural relaxed reaction for this day I
still run this experience made a long
lasting impression to me the importance
and understanding of a language now let
me take you a little bit further in time
as I was completing my college my child
would my childhood friend
now dr. Sam Cassell he came to the
United States to study for his PhD
through India Turkey the world traveler
he did his bachelor in India masters in
Turkey and we connected it was like we
were never apart we didn&#39;t see each
other for 10 years that were never part
so we started talking regular
communication and there were two things
one I finished my college and I started
working for that small company called HP
so every meeting that I went to I was
experiencing something that you guys are
talking about today there was no mention
of Africa in the business meeting and
that&#39;s really that really made me think
about the perception that is being
created about Africa then at the same
time there was something that is
happening in Ethiopia
that&#39;s really frustrated for both of us
we keep kept on talking about over the
phone he was in Virginia and I was in
Rutgers University and then Midwest so
we decided one day now for the regular
phone conversation to take out the
negativity out of our conversation we
promise to each other we will focus on
the things that we can influence or we
can solve as a result of that we started
the first Ethiopian - for our email
service back then there was no World
Wide Web the latest technology was
bulletin board for those of you were old
enough to remember and we created a
listserv we found some Ethiopian guy
whom I knew from Ethiopia he let us use
Sun Microsystems server and the
community started very important
projects that we did one we introduced
email to Ethiopia through Addis Ababa
University the largest university back
then by using the existing structure
fidonet through ECA Economic Commission
for Africa we sent hundreds hundreds of
modems by raising funds the second thing
that we did we hosted a first online
paper presentation and people presented
papers that paper was put emailed for
the distribution list and people asked
questions and so forth one of the topic
that came up was Unicode about Unicode
we didn&#39;t understand what Unicode was
Unicode is a standard standardized way
of encoding texts and symbols for the
word languages and as we investigated
more we realized that there is Unicode
consortium that recommends the
standardization submitted by governments
and other bodies so we immediately
we assembled computer scientists
linguist engineers ourselves and created
the Unicode for the Ethiopian language
Ethiopia now ten years later then we
went about our own business I was
focused on telecommunication I moved
around the country my friend became a
PhD became a professor 10 years later
both of us went through the dot-com and
the dot boom some of you from the United
States and around the world you&#39;ve heard
about the dot-com the dot boom really
made us ponder about the possibilities
normally when you face a challenge
that&#39;s when you start thinking so again
we went back to the work that we did 10
years ago the unicode and the importance
of the language we wanted to put one of
the ancient languages of the world in
the forefront of technology we did the
work we did the thinking it took us a
couple of years then we came up the
Eureka
our success story we&#39;re able to come up
with a way of a rendering of font on a
cell phone and we successfully mapped
345 characters to 12 keypads it&#39;s not
impossible but difficult to do that
created more questions than answers for
us now we created the thing what are we
going to do is it extendable to other
languages what kind of mechanism we&#39;re
going to use to transmit this thing so
we have to do research part of the
research was markula the market Fisher
research as well a lot of you have
talked about Africa being ignored and
also forth overs but look at the numbers
this is the journey that more while
technology has taken from 2002 forecast
for 2011 there are about 2.5 billion
subscribers around the world it&#39;s
expected
that number would reach about 5 billion
let me break it down for you by a region
mobile subscribers North America 2005
219 million 2011 294 million registered
the numbers Europe 669 669 million by
2011 679 million Latin America 220
million 2011 478 million
Middle East 43 million 2011 123 million
Africa 113 million 2011 478 million
forecast okay Africa today is
experiencing the highest growth rate on
mobile subscription so something is
happening if you look at the developed
world and the developing world you will
see two things one Africa is an attempt
untapped market to the Europeans in the
North Americans they have to come up
with some strategy to continue to grow
by the way I forgot AJ 836 million 2011
2 billion is still growing number wise
as the highest growth so the North
Americans the Europeans and the Asians
have to come up with strategy to
continue the growth and the strategy
that they come with a comma
Russell talked about ERP you average
revenue per user they have to start
value-added services the value-added
services are text messaging multimedia
service or premium messaging and etc so
if you look at this map it takes me back
to repeated theme that we heard today if
you look at it this is called
globalization
Thomas Friedman in his book idols the
world is flat he talked about today&#39;s
globalized
shanell third generation it is
globalization of individuals with
skillsets that helps us to look at the
world as a single market as a single
entity and this is driven I&#39;ll quote the
book this globalization is driven by
diverse individuals who are non-white
and we&#39;re not in North America
that means by people like you and me the
emergence of technology has brought us
together and helped us to learn about
each other as quickly as lightning
the world has shrunk but if you look at
it there&#39;s something that I couldn&#39;t get
the whole map but there&#39;s something
missing about Africa it&#39;s not in the map
look at all that volume there&#39;s a lot of
money going on between Middle East India
Asia China when you look at this I go
back to the map that we have seen
earlier again and again and again let me
tell you when I first started myself
courier at HP my district manager I took
a pay cut moved to Silicon Valley and my
district manager gave me a five years
customer history about 150 customers in
that spreadsheet let me tell you 95
percent of them were zeroes I was like I
pay I got a pay cut and zeroes and I
went back to his office I said what&#39;s
going on
is this true I thought he made some
mistakes you know and in a spreadsheet
so it was true and I was forced to look
at it as an opportunity and I was very
successful doing the task that I was
given so what we need to look at is
there is a lot of opportunity here a lot
of things can be done over there that&#39;s
the thinking and the mentality that we
need to have so with all the research
that we have done with everything that
that went on there was another Eureka
moment one
how are we going to transmit this
technology to the users to the
individuals I am proud to say my father
and I were or were we were given the
authority to perform the marriage
between what Web point to zero and the
wireless technology that we have we
created IP vis messaging what does that
mean and what are the problems that
we&#39;re solving because we have to pitch
to the VCS and they have to understand
and they have to understand that the
real thing
one the non Roman script characters
localization is done in local geographic
location what does that mean if you go
to China and you buy a phone in China it
is localized you can you see on the
keypad the Chinese characters symbols
and you can create a Chinese message in
Chinese and send it in China only if you
go outside of China you cannot do that
so we solve that problem how you
download our software on your cell phone
it doesn&#39;t matter what the cell phone is
you download it and you&#39;ll be able to
compose edits and receive messages in
Chinese that&#39;s exactly what we did for
the ETOP characters okay - the same
thing with Hindi character we in for
mirror in major Indian languages and we
also learn that the Ethiopian language
and the Hindi the Arabic the Hebrew they
are all called their group in abugida
languages or symbolic writing system
okay and we actually do some cool things
with the Hindi characters to create the
to create to create the package that we
did so with IP messaging and with the
font rendering you are able to send and
receive messages instantly instantly in
your own native language or language of
preference any place any time any
location and the complete package the
technology overview looks like this you
download first the applet onto yourself
and the other person will download the
applet on the surface would be on the
cell phone if you look at it the first
person is downloading the Chinese
character set into the into the English
cell phone and we have come up with the
scheme of IP messaging to to do that you
can also do text messaging and MMS from
the PC let me tell you how we created
that why we created that the Ethiopian
government about here at half ago
decided to close text messaging for
political reasons and we could not reach
our customers so we created Ethiopia dr.
messenger that people can chat using
their own language and also be able to
send a text message to us on to
everybody else outside of Ethiopia using
their own characters so we see and hear
and experience a lot of problems that
they&#39;re not problems they are
opportunities to be creative and do the
things that we do to move forward let me
give you one example of the application
from a development perspective this
shows you the of what a farmer goes
through in the coffee and the coffee
coffee farmer goes through to get the
product the coffee product into the
market look at the price that they&#39;re
they&#39;re getting paid for and look at
what the price is for for Starbucks I
have no problem Starbucks making money
but I want to empower the farmer to make
an informed decision based on receiving
the information of market right there
and then so that they can negotiate the
pricing with the information that they
have okay and the other thing is the
business application that that we do is
that the Google of the world can benefit
from the product that we have there is
no reason a businessperson in Africa or
elsewhere cannot advertise their product
through the cellphone somewhere else in
Asia for the same niche target market
okay
now a lot of things are talked about and
I want to take this opportunity I have a
few minutes if you may to to to use this
yes one minute
we have heard poverty poverty poverty
and if I ask you what the meaning of
poverty is that&#39;s a very good it&#39;s a
negative negative connotation but we
want to define it today here and now
because in cells we say the most
important cells is the second cell why
the first cell is selling into yourself
the second fearless to the customer so I
believe in that I want you to believe in
that and I want you to get up from your
seat and repeat after me please please P
stands for possibilities all stands for
opportunity B stands for validation of
our ideas East stands for our enthusiasm
to do things understand for our
resilience during a challenging time T
stands for trust y stands for yes
thank you said uh-huh
so you reserved the greatest part of
your talk for that last night that was
fantastic
thank you and your story get out of here
so what happened you started running for
the door as the tax preparer screamed
out loud science to give back she just
meant you done something right oh yeah
you know I I forgot to tell you I didn&#39;t
understand
get out of here means it&#39;s not true
that&#39;s what is nice is that true yes
sure it is all right thank you that
thank you
[Applause]
