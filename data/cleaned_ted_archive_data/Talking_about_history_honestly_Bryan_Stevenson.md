you
welcome back thank you you know you you
inspired people that day to such an
outrageous extent that we had no choice
but to raise some money for you and
about half an hour a million dollars was
pledged what happened to that well I&#39;m
here to give an update but I have to
take a second to express my gratitude to
this community what the people that Ted
did for me and the thousands of children
and incarcerated people I represent is
just been absolutely transformative I
was here three weeks before I was
scheduled to argue two cases at the
United States Supreme Court where we
were asking the court to ban death and
prison sentences imposed on children the
u.s. is still the only country in the
world that legalized its life
imprisonment without parole for kids
some as young as 13 and three months
later after my TED talk the Supreme
Court granted our appeal and has now
declared a death and prison sentences
unconstitutional no child in this
country will ever be subject to an
automatic
and actually with the support of this
community we&#39;ve extended that work we&#39;re
now trying to end putting children in
adult prisons there are 10,000 kids on
any given day under the age of 17 in an
adult jail or prison where they&#39;re five
times more likely to be the victims of
sexual assault eight times more likely
to commit suicide and we&#39;re committed to
eliminating that practice we&#39;ve
partnered acted with the Justice
Department who has done some work to
help us and then the other thing we&#39;re
trying to do is to create a minimum age
for trying children as adults there&#39;s
still 15 states where kids as young as 9
10 11 are actually fearing adult
prosecution where they can be made sex
offenders for the rest of their lives
because they&#39;ve done something
inappropriate and the support that the
community has offered us has really
allowed us to move that work forward
right is this a battle that has to be
won state by state
you&#39;ve obviously you had that Supreme
Court case but is most of the work done
on a state-by-state basis it is so you
know our criminal laws are largely state
laws and we have different policies in
different states
and so a lot of the work does have to be
done at the state level but I think
there is a broader narrative that we
need to engage in at the national level
that will influence what happens in each
of these various states and I think that
narrative is in some ways part of what
we were what I was trying to talk about
it Ted last time which is that we&#39;ve got
to be more thoughtful about what it
means to be led by fear and led by anger
and led by politicians that are punitive
and harsh and what it means to be
responsible and just in the society
where people are broken and marginalized
and disfavored and disabled and excluded
and I think that conversation gets us to
a different place both nationally and at
the local level and what&#39;s actually
happening on the ground and other
numbers getting worse or better and his
opinion shifting yeah no I when I was
here last time there hadn&#39;t been the
California initiative we actually want a
major success through a public ballot
they&#39;ve eliminated three strikes laws
and thousands of people were released
we&#39;ve seen a real shift the last couple
of years the prison population is
actually stabilized last year was the
first year we actually saw a decrease in
the prison population in the u.s. we
still have the highest rate of
incarceration
the world and we still have way too many
people in jails and prisons but some
people are starting to talk about how
it&#39;s time to be smart on crime not just
tough on crime and that really does I
think signal an opportunity a
possibility of changing the narrative in
this country so what&#39;s the main thing
that your organization is working on in
the year ahead well we started a new
project on race and poverty and I&#39;ve
been very excited about it we want to
change the way we talk about race in
this country there&#39;s a legacy of racial
inequality in America racial injustice
that we&#39;ve never really confronted
slavery is an issue that we&#39;ve never
really talked about there were myths
created about people of color during
slavery the Emancipation Proclamation
didn&#39;t do anything to deal with those
myths the Thirteenth Amendment doesn&#39;t
end those myths because of that in many
places slavery didn&#39;t end it just
evolved and then we had this era of
terrorism and violence where we did
horrible things and so we&#39;re trying to
counter that by putting up slavery
markers you come to Montgomery there are
59 monuments to the Confederacy into the
Civil War not a single word about
slavery so in December we put up four
markers talking about the slave trade
we&#39;re going to lynching sites across
this country and we want to put
monuments and memorials at lynching
sites to force this country to reflect
more honestly on that legacy of violence
and we want to change even the narrative
around civil rights it&#39;s the 50th
anniversary of a lot of these events and
you get this narrative now looking at TV
that you know one day Rosa Parks didn&#39;t
give up her seat the next day dr. King
led a march on Washington the third day
Congress passed some laws and and it&#39;s
just this wonderful transformation and
we haven&#39;t talked about what decades of
trauma and humiliation and subordination
did to people of color and to people who
are white some of them were taught that
they&#39;re better than other people because
of their skin color and we haven&#39;t
helped them recover from that abuse and
that lie is we have to change the
narrative around these issues
this is such an amazing conversation and
I hope I know that there are people here
who want to engage with you in the time
ahead thank you so much for coming here
for really igniting something big and a
lot of minds of people here and and in
America thank you so much you&#39;re very
welcome thank you
[Applause]
