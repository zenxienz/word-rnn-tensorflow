Sally osberg triggered in me a
recollection that serves as a preamble
for what I&#39;d like to say it was ten
after two on the morning of December the
10th 1948 when Eleanor Roosevelt rose on
a scrap of paper beside her the long
hard job done and she was right of
course because they had finished the
drafting of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and I&#39;d like to talk about
one part of the human rights aftermath
in February of 2006 in response to
direct requests for governments Kofi
Annan the secretary-general of the
United Nations announced the formation
of what was called the high-level panel
on system-wide coherence dealing with un
reform in the areas of development
humanitarian assistance and environment
for the United Nations believe it or not
that was a particularly mellifluous
title the appointment of the panel came
in the immediate wake of Kofi Annan
promising a few weeks earlier that all
UN panels and commissions thereafter
would reflect gender equality the panel
in question gave a slight twist to the
notion of gender parity by appointing 12
men and three women it&#39;s safe here to
use the vernacular all hell broke loose
Kofi Annan&#39;s promise having gone up in
smoke courtesy of his misogynist
advisers was the trigger for calling
attention to the UN&#39;s deplorable record
on gender as it happens my co-director
an aids-free world Paula Donovan had put
forward the year before for the first
time in the annals of multilateralism
the proposition that the UN should have
an international agency for women the
argument was clear there were agencies
for everything else under the UN Sun
from children to food the health to
labor but never an agency for women as a
result women were forever
the second class poppers of the UN
system at the time the proposal was made
it was greeted with incredulity by some
and derision by others the United
Nations create a new agency sixty years
later preposterous except that as a
result of the panel not so preposterous
after all the cry for a new women&#39;s
agency gathered voice and momentum and a
plan developed amongst those committed
to gender equality to force the panel&#39;s
hand it was a two-pronged strategy a
coalition of women&#39;s groups would caress
the establishment with the usual
blandishments while aids-free world
would engage in high-level advocacy at
the diplomatic level we shamelessly used
the veneer of male privilege to gain
access but we needed a blazing dossier
we got it Paula wrote a searing analysis
of the UN&#39;s history on women&#39;s issues
titled gender equality now or never not
only did it dismember the dismal UN
record on gender but it actually became
the blueprint for the General Assembly
resolution on which a new agency was
eventually based we circulated it to all
members of the panel in fact to use the
word circulated is to diminish the
overall intensity of the barage we
lobbied individually relentlessly every
single member of the panel we attended
their public meetings we haunted their
emails we brought their most influential
friends into the advocacy equation we
met with them secretly in conspiratorial
coffee shops over lactose free latte to
persuade them to do what was right we
made it impossible for the demand for a
women&#39;s agency to be overlooked remember
a woman&#39;s agency had not been on the UN
reform agenda for discussion the
original mandate was clear humanitarian
assistance development environment go
back to the website created at the time
of the appointment of the panel and you
will find Neriah words that saw women as
part of the agenda in fact you can&#39;t
find the word women period nonetheless
the two-pronged strategy paid off
our colleagues in the women&#39;s coalition
kept up the pressure and we lobbied with
a fierce near maniacal intensity
collectively it all proved so effective
that when the panel reported nine months
later in November of 2006 it recommended
the creation of a new United Nations
International Agency for women it was a
staggering development scarce to be
believed and then the real struggle
began somehow somehow the nations of the
world gathered in the General Assembly
of the United Nations had to be
persuaded that the recommendation for
the new women&#39;s agency should be
implemented for us there were three
non-negotiable items first the new
women&#39;s agency needed a minimum budget
of 1 billion dollars annually no
outrageous sum for half the world&#39;s
population and when you ponder the
trillions spent by the g8 on stimulus
packages and bank bailouts and wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq and oil spills and
the war on terror it seems unfathomable
that a microscopic smidgen of that
wouldn&#39;t be put to the use of the
world&#39;s women second it had to have the
operational ability to run programs on
the ground country by country a third
the choice of Under Secretary General to
lead it was crucial in fact the most
crucial with those imperatives in mind
there followed an epic saga of lobbying
and advocacy uninterruptedly the same
double prong tactics we kept the
pressure on methodically determinedly
tenaciously indefatigably giving
countries neither peace nor pause in
fact every significant ambassador at the
United Nations was lobbied in his or her
office often more than once with a
torrent of material and a cacophony of
argument never have I consumed such
quantities of putrid coffee it&#39;s no
wonder that wikileak reveals avold
brains
the process wasn&#39;t easy the United
Nations Secretariat at the very top
followed a policy of keeping the entire
exercise under wraps the massive media
apparatus of the UN was never employed
to tell the world what was afoot the
secretary-general made the occasional
reference in speeches but mostly his
conduct mirrored his approach to all
other issues involving women and
enfeebled rhetorical moment followed by
virtually no implementation whatsoever
indeed I dare say that even today for a
majority of this audience the possible
existence of a woman&#39;s agency is a
revelation but it also wasn&#39;t easy for
other more obvious reasons there&#39;s a
group of countries at the UN I don&#39;t
even have to name them whose misogyny is
legendary for them the idea of an agency
for women with power and resources
induced religious cultural and political
apoplexy but they lost they couldn&#39;t
block they couldn&#39;t impede they couldn&#39;t
withstand the vast majority of countries
when finally forced to face the facts
recognized how abysmal was the United
Nations record on gender and were
persuaded that something had to be done
on September second last but he Hercule
and struggle over the General Assembly
of the United Nations voted unanimously
not a single dissenting voice to create
a new international agency for women
it will become operational in 24 days
January the first 2011 for many of us
it&#39;s the best thing that&#39;s happened to
the UN in our lifetime it might even
change the culture of that obtuse
intractable impenetrable male fortress
after September second the struggle
shifted in these last few months to
questions of raising money and finding
staff with expertise in women&#39;s issues
but the truly critical question was who
would head the new agency it is
impossible adequately to describe the
cascading proliferation of candidates
all of whom were advanced by their head
of state some with credentials some with
no credentials some on the inside some
on the outside some government favorites
some whom governments wanted to jettison
some riddled with ambition some just
riddled whatever that means but
miraculously in a process totally
lacking in transparency where most of
the world didn&#39;t even know that the
position existed let alone was open one
candidate transcended all others
Michelle bechtle a former president of
chile was appointed a socialist feminist
to lead the agency who would have
thought it possible within the realm of
the United Nations it&#39;s amazing that no
country had a geopolitical cardiac
arrest we could not have done better
vasha lay has a remarkable reputation as
a leader Paula Donovan and I met with
her for an intense hour of conversation
just yesterday I don&#39;t want to stoke the
fires of expectation but I have to tell
you that the UN may never be the same
candor
candor principal intelligence vision no
evidence of paranoia my God my God how
will the legions of mouldy desiccated
bureaucrats cope but let me not get
entirely carried away my co-director and
I have between us 40 to 50 years of
experience with the United Nations we
have no illusions about its six-decade
failure to respond to the needs and
rights of women we know that the
Secretariat and most of the agencies
have a record on gender that is both
abject and hypocritical in the extreme
we know that the Security Council
pronounces on the agonies of women from
Olympian Heights and then never follows
through we know that the record of
nation states is irrevocably flawed so
let me not pretend that utopia is
imminent but for the first time ever
there is a crescendo of hope there is a
real possibility that under michelle
bachelet united nations will finally and
seriously address the myriad of women&#39;s
issues that have been allowed to
dissolve in a miasma of passivity and
indifference issues that so compromised
the lives women lead whether it&#39;s female
genital mutilation or sex trafficking or
intimate partner violence or child
brides or honor killings or the absence
of property rights of the absence of
inheritance rights or the absence of any
rights for that matter or the total lack
of economic autonomy or the shocking
rates of maternal mortality or the
hapless levels of political
representation or i may say the equally
hapless levels of women at the peace
table virtually that has not improved
over the last decade and above all the
ghastly contagion of rape and sexual
violence in so many societies indeed
perhaps Michelle Bachelet will begin
with the most egregious dimensions of
the assault on women where the UN has
proved criminally delinquent for example
the desperate growing disproportionate
infection and death from h-i
days or the virulent sexual violence in
the Congo Zimbabwe and now Haiti what a
godsend it would be if that panoply of
issues were confronted it&#39;s a tough go
male hegemony mutates through every
corridor of power political religious
institutional academic let me end with a
revealing anecdote from the world of HIV
and AIDS next year the School of Public
Health at Harvard University Harvard
University is holding a conference
entitled aids at 30 the first infections
having been recorded in 1981 to plan the
conference Harvard has assembled the
so-called global advisory council
consisting thus far of 21 members 19 men
and two women they never ever learn the
pandemic is a pandemic overwhelmingly of
women the carnage is the carnage of
women the adult womens wars in african
hospitals have been scenes of the
infernal well more than 15 million women
and girls dead thus far and an even
greater number living with the virus if
anyone understands the past present and
future of HIV and AIDS its women and yet
you have an advisory council of Notables
not mortals but notables 19 men and two
women I was invited and refused to be a
part of it so now there are 18 men and
two women
and that&#39;s the never ending struggle I
know it well I&#39;m not proud of the fact
that I know it well I too have
participated in those grotesquely
distorted male bastions it&#39;s the
instinctive assumption of male
entitlement I&#39;ve been credited by many
for the ultimate creation of the new
women&#39;s agency in large measure I&#39;ve
accepted that credit the instinctive
assumption of male entitlement when it&#39;s
far more appropriately belongs to my
co-director it&#39;s a sickness it&#39;s a male
pathology it has to be broken it
curtails the world for women I say to
all of you that while un women as it&#39;s
called may not be the salvation it could
be a citadel of enlightenment it&#39;s the
last best hope we have at this moment in
history thank
