have you ever felt like you&#39;re being a
pain in the ass or have you ever been
called difficult when you&#39;re a little
girl
difficult looks like raising your hand
in class because you know the answer
refusing to wear a dress so that you can
climb a tree or beating a boy in a
footrace when you&#39;re a woman difficult
looks like being outspoken or assertive
at work refusing to get married or have
children by a certain age or at all or
wanting to be President of the United
States of America by definition
difficult means not easy to deal with or
to manage characterized by causing
hardship or problems a difficult person
makes a fuss for no reason she&#39;s
unreasonable or perhaps wants when no
person of her race age gender or ability
has ever asked for or pursued before I
recently published my first book a
memoir entitled form brights a young
girl&#39;s journey from nothing to something
in America the book is deeply personal
after some thoughts I decided to
dedicate the book to all the teachers I
could remember that it helped me along
the way I wrote to one of those teachers
or former male professor and my
political science PhD programs to let
him know that I dedicated the book to
him and to ask if he still remembered me
he promptly wrote back and responded yes
I do you aren&#39;t the easiest graduate
students who work with but still one of
the best now I&#39;m a hundred percent
certain that he meant this as a
compliment
but I shut my computer and sobs in that
moment I was transported back to that
small classroom on that palatial campus
all the angst and uncertainty I have
felt those many years ago came flooding
back I was one of two black women
accepted into the program that year out
of 11 admitted the other woman my new
friend dropped out of the program after
our first semester saying she just
couldn&#39;t take it anymore
then visibility the feeling of not
belonging although I committed to
staying the course what I soon realized
was that there was very little space for
me there in the program there was a way
of doing things and I was doing and
saying all the wrong things
like asking what about women
what about race what about poverty I was
told matter-of-factly that those things
didn&#39;t matter to the political process
and when I insisted that those things
didn&#39;t in fact matter eyes rolled and my
peers avoiding me like the plague in a
meeting with the chair of my department
I was told that I needed a team you&#39;re
not going to survive here without a team
he said the only problem was no one
wanted me on their team there was no
room for me at the table I felt as
though I was asking for too much or that
I just didn&#39;t get it
something was wrong with me I was being
difficult in the end I finished the
program graduating at the top of my
class after I picked out a second email
thanking my professor for remembering me
I began to wonder whether or not being
difficult was such a bad thing I began
to ask myself what does it really mean
to be difficult I decided that difficult
means to disrupt the expectations of
others to ask for more than what&#39;s being
offered and to take the road set to be
close to me instead of thing being
difficult is something I should overcome
I decided to embrace it as a gift
perhaps this gift as I&#39;ve now taken to
calling it is the secret sauce of
kick-ass women from Wilma Mankiller to
Oprah Winfrey to Ruth Bader Ginsburg and
many others in a male-dominated world
that&#39;s bent on reminding us and subtle
Buscher ways of our place in society I
also figured out that for most if not
all of my lives
I&#39;ve been difficult I&#39;m going to talk to
you today about three kinds of
disruption or difficult nough seen in
the world and that has helped me to be
Who I am
the first disruption is the disruption
of dominant powerful narratives what are
narratives they&#39;re the stories that we
tell about others in ourselves and about
how the world works sometimes they can
be harmful stereotypes like all black
men are dangerous all Latinos are
undocumented immigrants are all whites
are well-off these stories carry power
and meaning in our society disrupting
the dominant narrative is not easy often
there&#39;s a rust to tamp down the new
story or to discredit it why because
it&#39;s at odds with the story we all have
an investment and believing one of the
most powerful narratives we have in our
society is that of the American Dream
it&#39;s the idea that regardless of where
you begin in life if you work hard
enough you&#39;ll make it to the top if you
don&#39;t it&#39;s because you didn&#39;t try hard
enough our ability to succeed in society
is much less determined by our grit or
determination than it is by our zip code
or the families we were born into I know
this firsthand
growing up in my neighborhood I knew
kids much smarter than me that never
made it to college not because they
didn&#39;t try hard enough or because they
did bad thing
but because they lacked the access to
information and resources or attended
low quality schools I also live next
door to families that work 40 or more
hours per week that never seem to make
ends meet
I believe these stories were missing
from the dominant narrative on poverty
and prosperity in our country we must
stop telling stories that aren&#39;t true or
at the very least incomplete taking the
time to tell richer more complex stories
about others in our society will allow
us to connect more fully and
authentically to those around us we can
encourage the disruption of dominant
narratives by becoming better listeners
and by allowing the voices and the
experiences of the most vulnerable among
us to shape our worldview and our sense
of justice and fairness the second kind
of disruption I want to talk to you
about is the courage to disrupt the
rules and the status quo about two years
ago I became the coach of my children&#39;s
soccer team at the time at the time I
was the only woman coach in our division
I know where you&#39;re wondering and the
answer is no I have never played soccer
before in my life this is seriously
before each game it&#39;s customary to greet
the other coach to go over the rules on
occasion when I would walk out onto the
field the other coach would like look
over my head and ask where&#39;s the coach
for the other team I can&#39;t seem to find
him I&#39;m like it&#39;s me um the coach I
would say calmly and
inside though I was thieving and vowed
when we walked back to our respective
sidelines to kick some kitty sucker ass
and we did we were undefeated in chaos
food and food once a coach requested
that we switch guideposts a goalpost
he said the field was planted giving us
an unfair advantage although I doubted
the science on that I agreed another
time we reported to the league for
excessive scoring up to that point there
seemed to be an unspoken rule that only
men coached even if they too had never
played soccer I want it I decided to
become a coach because I wanted little
girls and other moms to see me and to
know that it was only it was not only
possible to play but to lead a team for
the most part the rules that govern our
society were not made for are created by
women people of color LGBTQ individuals
are economically vulnerable they were
created by a small group of
property-owning white men a long long
time ago what does that mean in terms of
disruption or being difficult it means
that when women blacks Latinos gays or
others talents the rules protests demand
a seat at the table or for rights long
denied they&#39;re considered difficult or
to be asking for too much
it also creates a disruption to the
status quo and to the way things have
always been done
sometimes the disruption can be as small
as a change from misses to missed or a
significant and life-altering as the
1964 Civil Rights Act the passage of
title 9 and 1972 or the legalization of
same-sex marriage in 2015 this kind of
disruption is the most urgent and
necessary
it&#39;s rooted in our shared humanity and
the fulfillment of our human potential
when the doors swing open for those who
have been long denied access an
opportunity magic and history happens
the last disruption that I want to talk
to you about is the disruption of the
expectations and limitations placed upon
us by society or others did you know
that less than 4% of those born into
poverty will ever make it to the very
top and only about one in four will ever
reach the middle class for many
regardless of race overcoming overcoming
poverty is akin to winning the lottery
as a brown-skinned girl born to a
teenage mother in Los Angeles California
the expectations for my life were carved
out before I could ever expect begin to
imagine what I might want for myself I
believe this is true for all children
including those born into privilege our
environments our homes our schools our
communities and our daily interactions
with the outside world some signal to us
what we can expect to become and how far
we can go in life the bar for my success
was low no one in my family had ever
finished high school and because we were
poor I did not expect much more than I
already had which to be honest was very
little it was assumed that I was going
to become a domestic worker and one of
the mega hotels in Las Vegas like my
grandmother or a school bus driver like
my mom or a hairdresser and while all
these job all these were considered good
jobs in my neighborhood it&#39;s safe to say
that none of them will lead to a solid
middle-class life with a comfortable
retirement package and enough to pay
college tuition for my seven-year-old
twins I was expected to become what I
saw and not aim higher however I had a
different vision for myself one bigger
and that would require the disruption of
the expectations and the limiting
stigmas placed upon
black poor poor people blacks and girls
in our society and the biggest one yet
what I could become in life how do I not
have a courage to disrupt or to be
difficult I wouldn&#39;t be standing here
before you today so you see being
difficult is a gift it&#39;s not only a gift
to those to the person who&#39;s pushing the
boundaries are stepping more fully into
her power or potential but to all of us
because this Russian creates progress
now let&#39;s all go out there and be
difficult
[Applause]
