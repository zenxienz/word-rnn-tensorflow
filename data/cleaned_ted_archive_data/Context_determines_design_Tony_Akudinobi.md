I&#39;m a visual thinker I am presenting
their weakened African a design
perspective every person lives within
the content and context of these
definitions the content is the within
which is coming from Rincon conditions
coming from past life and also from the
band of experience that we all have that
is what is within then the context is
outside where we all work on the
contemporary African highway and we take
the dogs to dice all from cultural
projectiles also some of those heaps are
fatal some of them we dock dive and do
what and continue dust but whatever
experience we have on this contemporary
African Highway would from lampposts as
guards of Honor for us and for people
who are coming behind us because you
take our places in the past but live in
the present
for the future we seek belongs to the
unborn this is like Attica
mountable I went to buku once on a
research program and I met principal
Ikki and I asked him he said tell me
what I look in foil I was at the curator
I said I&#39;m looking for something there&#39;s
a we have chairs all over Nigeria that
they call antiques and I look at them
what do they have flora Corinthian
designs how did they tie how did they
connect with us our past and the future
and said then what are you looking for I
said I&#39;m looking for relief symbols
motifs that will connect us to where we
are coming from make us enjoy the
present and for the future and they will
embrace so he took me into a room and
showed me a very delicate design early
symbol that is given to a woman while
she&#39;s married it was from the tip of the
boobies - right here
between the breasts very delicate and
when he showed me that I looked at him I
shouted there&#39;s an ebow wedding ring and
he embraced me I said people when I say
yes that means in our own culture in
wherever we come from we have ways of
saying she is married so that&#39;s a
catechist monami
the two faces of spirit now one day I
was there with a friend of mine and he
said it wasn&#39;t feeling too well so
what&#39;s the problem he said Tony I&#39;m a
victim of one of these rare blood
diseases and I looked at him he couldn&#39;t
say much and then this chair
later I found out he had a sickle cell
crisis then this chair is sickle cell
it&#39;s part of being black is part of our
lives but what can we do mutations what
do we do across the rainbow bridge not
only when we ask why when we come back
to take decisions in versity of gaining
they&#39;ve been able to have to stem cell
transplants that changed all that from
SS to a.s and then the sickle cell goes
please now this is the Kohanga the Cabal
it exists in every government it&#39;s here
in Nigeria is the coven if you look at
what they are doing in some other
Palance I call it government magic if
you stay we have to do what we have to
awaken we have to let ourselves know
it&#39;s a part of our history and what do
we do unless we consciously unless you
have a cognitive resonance towards these
things we will not be able to say we
have come to the end of it by chasing
them away
and finding a place in the Sun this is a
sickly shrine I look at the city shrine
I see many people putting on TV and I
tell them slave trade wasn&#39;t about oil
wasn&#39;t about Diamond wasn&#39;t about gold
it was about cotton sugar and so many
other people from parts of Africa where
part of that blood sweat and tears are
welcome to that and into that
development that cotton is what led Levi
Strauss now the genes and okay tells you
to Legos and feel very cool as a part of
every adapted from we do motor down to
Lagos Island here everything not the
same thing but what are we saying what
we are saying is that some people paid
the price for that now it&#39;s coming back
to us in
friend forms and what do we do we seek
them use them we don&#39;t abuse them we use
them is a sacrifice in the city shrine
there&#39;s no name
there&#39;s no tribe there&#39;s nothing you
just come worship and go
thank you from where I come this is
Mount Mao is the masquerade the
masquerade is a patch of the culture it
is the voice of our ancestors we tell
the truth beyond that as a morale
chatter which they keep the secrecy and
all that has eluded to them that is what
till today so many masks you eat are
powerful in our society and when they
come out and say this is it and that is
it finish it does not go to any local in
some places in some other places they
will try to do a vision and then argue
but that is a mouth open the legs all
the way I come from what we are doing is
that we&#39;re trying to let the children
know that these stories these are we
these are paths to the Golden Lake of
the Sangha the Paradise Lost and game
where I come from you can look at this
chair the two legs are differently
designed because where I come from in a
ball and if you are going somewhere
early in the morning and your right leg
hits upon a stump
it means differently if your left leg
hits upon a stump
this is bad luck and to so many does it
has it has been walking that way so many
people believe it and it works for them
so that is aku that here
that chair is a song to an enemy but
it&#39;s not that why is it a song to our
enemy what you see behind in the fixes
those are the ancient a shanty gold with
design symbols the ancient Ashanti gold
web design symbols of the Sun it goes
like this
the ancient a shank gold with design
symbol of the moon it goes like that if
you go to the next National Mosque in
Abuja on-topic you see it it is a fact
all over the by but what does it mean in
Africa is a symbol of the Sun and a
symbol of the moon and if you sit on it
it simply says the Sun shall not smite
you by day nor the moon by night so
these are the things these are parts of
us the obody kanga the Urbani kanga is
the power of a man to say in his ass
this issue is going to be he may be
wrong it may be right but it&#39;s also that
which makes demands take responsibility
for what the culture has put or in
prostate funny so the organic a geyser
when he&#39;s leaving the village and is
coming to town and has not seen a gas
cooker and goes into the brothers a son
in laws kitchen and they like a gas
cooker without a mattress and the man
runs back as Hilton Darwin this will
have tried me
it does not mean that he left whatever
he came to town with he adjusted back
and they say no daddy sorry this is gas
cookers is okay you can cook so that&#39;s
the Albany kinga it&#39;s everywhere we use
you go with it you protected you accept
the responsibilities that accompany that
but on this path also to this or Trudi a
contemporary African highway to wear to
the Golden Lake of the sun-god you find
out that the awakened African stands on
the mound and on the dumb mound he sees
our paradise lost and gained so many
times
thank you very much
[Applause]
