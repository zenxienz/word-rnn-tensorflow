God is really really weird 40 artists to
be facing stage audience I should have
thought about this before I started that
for this I think the reason for this is
because in a museum or gallery I&#39;m never
in front of you and you assume that I&#39;m
never there but you&#39;re wrong you know
one of my job&#39;s is a professional artist
to spend long periods of time looking
out on museum conversations trying to
follow you around see how you go about
when you&#39;re gonna see pictures what&#39;s
interesting about the way people move
within a museum is pale compared to what
the reasons what people still move
towards museums you think about it in a
the moment where most museums are
actually making their collections public
to the Internet we&#39;re actually picking
on it has never been so many people
visiting museums in the world you know
what is it about the picture in a wall
that still elicits this power over
people know when you come to think about
when you are actually in front of a when
you actually moving towards the picture
that&#39;s in a wall you&#39;re going against
it&#39;s really thick flow of visual
information that&#39;s naturally coming your
way you&#39;re going against the tide but
you still you do it what is it about
that you know makes you go to a museum
instead of just downloading a picture in
your cell phone well by watching you the
way you go about things when you visit
the museum I&#39;ve noticed a few things
first of all a still image is not a few
at all so matter of fact there is not
such thing as a still image and as you
who you know I&#39;ve noticed you doing it
you all do it because I spy on you all
the time when you&#39;re in a museum you you
know try to walk casually thank you
pretend you are disinterested in all of
a sudden try to find something that
catches your eye and when you do you
move towards that that images say it&#39;s a
painting you know
and you stopped short of an imaginary
line in the lock in the floor you do
something quite weird you do this you
all do because I&#39;ve seen it and what why
do you do that it&#39;s actually quite
simple you know by the time you get to
that imaginary line you up to the point
where you can actually see what the
image is trying to tell you so the
artists tries to tell you what that
actual visual thoughts represents even
you get closer to it you get to see what
it&#39;s made out of you know normally let&#39;s
say you&#39;re painting it&#39;s made out of
really disgusting things you know stuff
that is dug out from the ground or is
actually being extracted from plants or
animals but when it&#39;s actually carefully
put together with Carol intelligence
gets to become that picture you see when
you get a little bit away from it and
when you get close to it if something
that&#39;s just material even you get far
from it you get something that&#39;s ideal
as you approach it you see matter when
you get away from it you see mind but
something tells me because you&#39;re doing
this again again and again you&#39;re not
looking for the method or the mind parts
of this bargain you know somehow you&#39;re
actually looking for something right in
between when something turns into
another this magical moment of
transformation you know and you&#39;re
enjoying the crossing of this threshold
the separates the world the things that
you can understand and know from the
world of things that you can just feel
and assume it&#39;s that there&#39;s something
at the right moment when something
becomes something else this little
bubble a little air a little gap that
produces a sort of a suspended Lodge I
cannot explain quite well how it feels I
can give you an example if it&#39;s like
when the you know the ball has left the
handle the basketball player it hasn&#39;t
reached the rim yet like what you feel
with second before a first year or like
one instant after the punch line of a
real good joke try to get that in your
cell phone
you know photography for 24 years have
allowed has allowed me to actually
reproduce this feeling because we&#39;re the
photograph you have a chance to enhancer
to extend the moment in which in which
one thing transforms into something else
because you can ship scales in the
photograph and also because you can
recognize a material within the picture
you can also play this game of mind and
method just exemplify to you a second
ago and you know when I started working
with art I thought of making this very
simple pictures that have split meanings
and it was something like producing
these really simple puzzles that I was
given to the viewer to be put that
together when you look at this you think
of a pencil drawing but it slows
attention you know when you look close
it&#39;s not a pencil drawing it&#39;s actually
a photograph of a sculpture made out of
wire you start asking about how big it
was it how long did it take to make it
it was three dimensional we was flat and
before you know you&#39;re not just looking
at something you&#39;re actually thinking
about the way you look at something from
the simplicity of simple lines I went
into a little bit of more elaborate
subjects like we&#39;re actually making
drawings accumulating thousands of years
of thread over a single surface from
lines that went to dot now this is a
picture of my of just a drawing made
with soil over a lightbox it actually
represents my hand a similar technique
justin- and I drew with sugar you know
these are portraits of kids from the
Caribbean islands and kids and they are
done with sugar and then that&#39;s when you
actually use the material such as sugar
you add another meaning to it something
synesthetic something that our haptic
you know you&#39;re thinking of a taste it
actually the plot thickens right there
and if I thinking about taste and how
you could refuse the sensation of
pasting pictures I started thinking
about working with chocolate chuckle is
a very complex
substance in as much as it is the
cultural invention as much as an
industrial one and when you mean it
evokes a serious and enormous the range
of sensations they can go from luxury
romance guilt or bedding scatology
everything you draw with shoot with
chocolate is doing it affects their
images drawing with you know we we are
always inflicting meaning into pictures
I think about you know I do things with
something that evoked the idea of value
as well like him drawing things with
with diamonds you know it was this
famous slogan they actually saved the
diamond industry in the late 40s was
called a diamond is forever and so it&#39;s
granite when you think about value
implicit in pictures you know I
conducted this experiment a few years
ago in which I invited a group of people
they had no contact with art whatsoever
to come to my studio in work on their
portraits using the material that they
use every day in this case these were
scavengers they work in a garbage dump
near by the project took over three
years of my time it was subject of a
film called wasteland they received very
many many many prizes including an Oscar
nomination what I learned from it is
actually I could share this thing that I
love to do the most is actually play
with ideas and images and I could do
this with a group of people that with no
contact with this whatsoever took the
same pleasure in this experience change
their lives as much as it changed mine
after this you know I should never look
at the an audience or looking at a
museum crowd in the same way again
haven&#39;t seen this film I really is not
because it&#39;s my teammate and i&#39;m not
selling you can sit get it on net you
know you can get it for free on the
internet if you want to you know dealing
with very lofty big ideas when i started
making larger and larger drawings i
realized it became aware of this
not only a material entropy this lost
the meaning that it exists both
materially and also of it it&#39;s a
semantic entropy the more the larger the
things I was making the less significant
they become you know a few years ago I
paired with some a mining company in I
did this really humongous drawings in
central and northern Brazil and the fact
that you know I wanted to really make a
contrast between the effort this
Byzantine logistics of putting this
thing together you know in the banality
of what they&#39;re trying to represent
their really stupid pictures but they
took a lot of work to do you know
they&#39;re about 30 of them when you&#39;re
dealing with really really large things
you know you don&#39;t you lose your
economic connection to them and they
become purely mental thinking of the
same way about big things you know I
pair I did a stint with a residency at
MIT recently in which with the help of a
friend marcela whaley we actually
managed to translate drawings that I had
produced with the 19th century device
called a camera lucida for 21st century
technology called field which is a focus
Ian being in with these were able to
actually make this very intricate
etching of capsules on single grains of
sand when you think of something that&#39;s
actually invisible actually there are
more like grains of dust you know
because if they would be here they&#39;ll be
floating around now I want to make a
portrait of my daughter which is two and
a half year olds and not make a picture
of it I want just to throw it in a
panama beach with the hope that one day
when she&#39;s there with their boyfriend
which is like 14 15 she will look at the
beach engl you really love me can you
find my portrait in it
you know when you start playing this is
okay when you start playing at that
scale we start having actually different
ideas about to deal with things this is
an old wish of mine was actually to
create pictures with living things and
also at MIT I teamed up with a
bioengineer called Alden I know first I
want to do two pictures with like mold
or some kind of substance that would be
very big you know the big relatively big
butts I&#39;ll actually help me do these
pictures which with the aid of stem
cells a little you know we can actually
make photographs with living cells this
thing is not really working you know and
what we were trying to do we&#39;re trying
to inflict some kind of a comfortable
logical show metric Patrick something
that at first look very chaotic but our
familiarity with these things taught us
that you know the order and the behavior
of these things the cells actually
surpassed by far you know the geometry
they were trying to impose on them these
are actually a picture of sorry it&#39;s
actually a picture of liver cells in
which you can see every single cell and
everything on nuclear on it this is our
vaccinia virus these are actually
cervical cells hello cells there are
cancer itself and this I&#39;m working
recently with stem cells and hoping that
where this is their last piece that
we&#39;re trying to do in try to make it
with neurons which are very hard to do
for each type of tissue which is type of
bacteria or virus we need to change the
complete the process in which work you
know we scan it different so it&#39;s been
taking a long time to get this series to
a gallery so you can see it Leslie you
know we&#39;re talking about parts and holes
know everything every time I show my
work in retrospect I realized that I am
sort of mosaic artist you know I grew up
poor in the Oscars of San Paulo Brazil
and my vision
history of my childhood it&#39;s comprised
on nine pictures that my aunt my mother
sister took on me because she owned the
Cameron she lived in Miami so every year
she visited and she took a picture it
took me another year to get to see what
she had done when I was a non growing a
little bit older you know by the time I
started finding pictures of family
pictures in like garage sales and flea
market it surprised me to see that these
pictures had somehow became lost they
sort of like sukin independent path they
were orphaned pictures and I always
never had money i bought them you know
that initial little hobby became a
collection that now has more than
100,000 items and for those of you who
collect vernacular photography you know
that the only way you can organize this
collection is by just classifying them
by what they are actually trying to mean
when you playing with that before you
know you know we start realizing that by
making like these pictures like this is
actually me by the way you have the
picture of the boy the bicycle is called
25th of december you have the photograph
of the couple you have the photograph of
the wedding you know and before you know
you start realizing that you&#39;re actually
organizing these very very generic
moments that punctuate the the wisdom of
our lives the perhaps there actually
were very very influenced by photography
itself it&#39;s interesting that in about
five years ago you know this material
started being dumped in the internet i
started being able to buy them in like
in like a lots of like 25,000 you know
in all of a sudden my house had became
the huge mausoleum of orphan pictures
and I thought I had to do something with
them actually the moment you know I
started finding these pictures more
available internet point sides with the
fact that cameras will be installed in
every single cell phone we somehow
change or have the stores pictures of
ourselves you know where stand
more time taking them there looking at
them and what was once something that
was passed from father to son like
genetic genetic heritage you know the
photo album has become completely
obsolete some really amazing ruptures
has happened in a way in which you
relate to our past about almost 200
years old we can we have come up with
the technology that was powerful
powerful enough that we trusted our
entire history both private and
collective and we thought this would be
the perfect receptacle receptacle of it
you know and you know nowadays we seem
to have improved the technology to such
extent that we turn that the trust in
that document completely obsolete it&#39;s
something that it&#39;s happening it&#39;s so
recent you know and i don&#39;t think i have
answers for it I think my last project
here in Rio is a school the school of
visual literacy for small children you
know cuz I believe education will be the
only thing though help us survive
understanding or heritage understand
your history in actually being able to
continue or projects of history of
civilization in the world where we
cannot trust any more visual documents
thank you very much
I am I actually don&#39;t have a question
for you because because i have a hundred
questions and there&#39;s no time but i just
wanted to say thank you for what you did
for Ted back then what you&#39;ve done since
in your career your work is just
jaw-dropping oh man thank you no thank
you sigma nu&#39;s
