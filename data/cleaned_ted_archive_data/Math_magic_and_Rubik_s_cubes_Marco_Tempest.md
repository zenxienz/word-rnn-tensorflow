good morning it&#39;s a pleasure to be here
thank you I&#39;m sure that everyone in the
room recognizes this the Rubik&#39;s Cube
most of you have probably played with it
but I&#39;m also guessing that not quite so
many of you were able to solve it ern√µ
Rubik created this puzzle in the 1970s
and it spread like wildfire books were
written competition staged record set
experts were interviewed it&#39;s probably
the most recognizable puzzle of the 20th
century and it is as popular and
challenging today as when it first
appeared the cube became part of the
culture an iconic design like this that
is now recognized all over the world so
please take some cubes mix them up don&#39;t
be nice really mix them up please
a good puzzle is a mystery and we love
mysteries please as Einstein said the
most beautiful thing we can experience
is the mysterious thank you all right
okay maybe I can get some of the puzzles
back thank you all right thank you very
much thank you
ouch okay thank you okay
let&#39;s get a few more thank you great job
thank you one more would you actually
mind joining me on stage
yeah it&#39;s a big round of applause for
our volunteer Helena all right
so we have all these cubes and I like
you to select one of the cubes and give
it to me any cube will be fine
okay thank you puzzles give us the
opportunity to solve a seemingly
impossible challenge there are mysteries
that promise a solution just have to
find it okay I&#39;m going to give this a
try it&#39;s going to be very very quick so
don&#39;t take your eyes off the cube just
like this maybe thank you
let&#39;s try something a little more
difficult could have one more cube back
any cube is fine
okay so I&#39;m not going to touch this cube
but I like to see it from all sides so
could you hold it up and that just spin
it slowly okay and could I see this side
too all right
okay I&#39;m gonna give this a try
not sure looks like we have two
completely messed up cubes but here&#39;s
the mystery this side here and this side
here the same is true for site number
two three four five and six thank you
thank you very much for helping out
thank you well the rubik&#39;s cube is not
an easy puzzle but its design is elegant
and it taps into that universal desire
to solve problems to ring meaning from
chaos it&#39;s one of the traits that make
us human and has taken us to where we
are now discovering the secrets that
make up our world
and whether you&#39;re an artist scientist
or philosopher or just trying to figure
out the cheapest airfare on the internet
we all share the same joy when we
discover one of those secrets that aha
moment when every Sigma sense and you
can smile at the sheer simplicity of it
all thank you thank you very much and
thank you professor Ruby thank you
