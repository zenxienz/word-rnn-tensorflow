okay uh so let&#39;s suppose a recall how we
see objects and I can tell you that the
only two approaches first there&#39;s this
lecture so let&#39;s say if we illuminate an
object with leather light we reach our
eyes and allows us to see it okay this
is now the metra graduating to see me on
stage but i can see there&#39;s another way
if we illuminate an object there&#39;s
always a shirt off behind this object so
this is a okay even if we can not see
the object we can always see the shirt
off this is now the message you can see
me on the stage here this is also the
method if you can recall this is also
the method that is used in 1999 by
Yugoslavia&#39;s to bring down an f-117
stealth aircraft using a specially
designed video system to detect its
shadow so so a cheaper solution of
course is to remove this object from
elimination but what if we want this
object to stacey has the merely be
invisible over the past decades people
have developed critical technologies
that it can be that can allow us to
remove the reflection from the object
the principle is to absorb the incident
light from the inflator light from a
leaflet objects such as that you can
cure the reflection therefore you can
become invisible but the property is it
is really pull it is pretty cool but the
problem is you have involved the shuttle
problem so it should have these shadows
which remains detectable so this has
remained to be that we can insert has
been fatal to the to the stealth
technologies so can we so so true you
will repeat you cannot be achieved
unless we can find a way to recover the
shadows as if the object were not there
but how to imagine we can spend the
light around this object as if in the
same way as water stream around this
object then and if so no observable we
were able to see through
object as if the object will not there
but how to penalize imagine we have a
finite volume space in front of us and
then we lift up the bottom of this space
to squeeze it then the light will be
bent together with the screen space
without disturbing the outside
environment and during the whole process
the optical path is always preserved
therefore anything we put inside this
bump under this creative space we&#39;re
being visible because from the viewpoint
of the light the pump doesn&#39;t exist and
I have found that we can actually use
calcite to mimic this screen space and
acute and abuse in with ability close
calcite is a cheap and abundant mineral
made of calcium carbonate is most
commonly found as the leg aside in
stalagmites in limestone caves here we
have build a simple prototype of
invisibility cloak using just two pieces
of calcite very simple and here we&#39;re
going to use the air to close a piece of
post a note is pink objects which is
rolled up to fit under this close so you
can see that which is how it works I&#39;m
going to move this cloth to cover the
middle part of this pink object and you
can see that it&#39;s a cover the part you
can see there the cover the party come
transparent you can see food is actually
even even a scientific instruments they
can measure the optical path cannot
detect it I need exercise we&#39;re here we
still have a lot of limitations first of
all this can be damaging these oil so
you can see this is oil here but still
this is the first this is the first
realization of utility as a natural
skill which you can see region we do
with ice and many people ask me why I&#39;m
doing this research I&#39;m doing this as a
way to explore better light control
strategies which is very useful in
imaging in communication data processing
and defense if we can control like that
will eventually we can have the power to
let there be light this
our vision thank you very much
