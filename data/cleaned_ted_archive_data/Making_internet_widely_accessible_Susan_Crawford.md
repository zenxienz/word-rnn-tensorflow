Robert Caro has written beautifully how
about the people living in West Texas
outside Austin in the hill country they
love Franklin Delano Roosevelt they
thought he was great they read all about
him they knew all about his wonderful
fireside chats but they couldn&#39;t hear
those radio fireside chats because they
didn&#39;t have electricity in fact Carol
writes in agonizing detail about the
difficulty of the lives of those people
outside Austin women bent by the effort
of their lives dragging heavy objects
around just to cook just to clean just
to eat their lives dominated by sunup to
sundown very difficult to read later at
night to have dominion over their own
lives why how could this be possible in
1930s America no electricity well the
reason was that where there were giant
giant power monopolies private companies
controlling the generation and
transmission electricity in America they
each had their own regions they each did
our own thing they were gouging the rich
systematically leaving out the poor and
just the propaganda machine of these
guys was unbelievable and so although
electricity comes to America 1980s it
takes until 1910 that ordinary people in
cities have it and in 1930 ninety
percent of farmers in America did not
have electricity it was a luxury good
and so the 1932 election was all about
electricity FDR said the people have
paid and paid dearly and they&#39;re
beginning to understand that reform is
needed because they&#39;ve been fleeced of
millions of dollars and he ran on
electricity and he was attacked for
being on American Bolshevik subversives
because what he wanted to do was break
up the power monopolies make sure that
people in rural areas had electricity
and also support public systems that you
know could hold the private systems to a
yardstick we can see how cheap it could
be
public systems were allowed to operate
we had never seen a monopoly like the
depredations of electricians in the
history of the world they lied they
misled everybody they had incredible
political power we&#39;ve never seen that
until high-speed internet access in
America which is the same kind of story
and even though you need I speak the net
connection high-capacity can actually to
get educated to get a job to send your
kids to school these days to be part of
21st century society fully a third of
Americans don&#39;t have a wire their homes
the affluence you know those of us
around here we&#39;re paying way too much
for second-class connections which are
by and large provided by the cable
monopolies in America which have divided
up the country never compete with each
other and charge whatever they want and
for 18 million Americans internet access
isn&#39;t available at any price because it
just hasn&#39;t been built where they are so
parents take their kids to parking lots
outside public libraries to do their
homework because that&#39;s the place they
can get access to free Wi-Fi provided by
the libraries because they don&#39;t have a
wire at home there&#39;s a tremendous
digital divide inside America between
the poor and rural and the rest of us
it&#39;s also a huge problem for America&#39;s
competitiveness as a nation because
other countries take this very seriously
and they&#39;re investing in fiber in
America a high capacity connection is
going to be sold to you by the cable
companies and it&#39;s not going to be
available in rural areas or in poor
areas and this is particularly quite a
look at this map of America the green
spots show places where at least sixty
percent have access to a crappy dsl
connection right the red spots show
where even that doesn&#39;t exist and that&#39;s
a lot of America so that&#39;s why it&#39;s such
a big problem to the country what
happened was that systematically the
cable guys took over wired and the
wireless guides 18 T and Verizon backed
away from the wiring marketplace they
just can&#39;t make money there so there are
almost entirely wireless companies now
life is great
if you&#39;re a cable monopolist and they&#39;re
getting 99% of new subscriptions for
high-speed internet access and Comcast
revenues are soaring really it&#39;s a quiet
life for them so even though high-speed
internet access is just like electricity
just like clean water you needed to
survive as an American we need it as a
country to keep up with the rest of the
world it&#39;s being treated like a luxury
goods not like a utility so what did FDR
do when he came to the office he
established oversight which we don&#39;t
have over high speed net access made
sure that was oversight of electricity
he subsidized rural areas and he made
sure that public systems were available
to hold people to ER signal West Texas
when LBJ brought electricity to those
Hill people they named their children
after him because he had changed their
lives and the leader that takes this on
will feel empowered thank you very much
