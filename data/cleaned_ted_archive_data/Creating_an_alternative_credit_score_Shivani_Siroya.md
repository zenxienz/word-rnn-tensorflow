we&#39;ve all been scored I&#39;ll never forget
my SAT score or the score when India won
the World Cup but this score means a lot
more to me it&#39;s my credit score and it&#39;s
my financial identity
it&#39;s how I rented my apartment how I
bought my car and one day hopefully
it&#39;ll be how I buy a home for my family
my score was created through an
aggregation and analysis of my public
consumer credit data through companies
like Experian Equifax and FICO these
companies then pass on my credit score
to banks in order to help them make
lending decisions and measure my risk of
default but what if I had no public
identity no public data on me no social
security number no credit card what then
I would be one of the 4.5 billion people
around the world that lack of financial
identity so let&#39;s take Vijaya Lakshmi
from Van de Vos seasonal Nadu India
she&#39;s the owner of a convenience store
called
Lakshmi fancy store and she lives in a
world entirely of cash she is no
collateral and no financial history just
expenses written on torn sheets of paper
if the Jaya Lakshmi has outgrown
microfinance but she still lacks the
upfront cash that she needs for big
expenses that can really help her get
ahead and so how can she prove her
capacity to repay without a credit score
right now she can potentially go to a
moneylender she can bribe someone within
the bank to get connected to a loan
officer or she can try and round up a
group of people who can help vouch for
her credibility but what if there was
another way it&#39;s true that we don&#39;t have
traditional financial data on Vijaya
Lakshmi but what if instead we looked at
her daily life and all of the data that
it generates could we collect this data
and turn it into someone&#39;s financial
identity who we build an alternative
credit score
for Vijaya Lakshmi out of her daily life
and spending habits a score that can
actually get her a legitimate loan from
a commercial bank and so I needed to
find out and I created insight to do
that insight works through text
messaging and voice technology allowing
individuals like Vijaya Lakshmi to use
simple cell phones to input things like
sales rent labor transportation and
inventory all through a simple text
message or call to our system we then
gather that data and we compare it
against baseline data that we&#39;ve
collected and we apply our own
individualized algorithm to create a
credit score Vijaya Lakshmi insight
score is a great 700 out of 800 and with
our score in hand she was able to go to
a bank that&#39;s accepting our scores and
she applied for a two thousand dollar
loan and now rather than traveling 120
kilometers to Chennai every two weeks
she is able to save money and buy bulk
inventory and she&#39;s now reinvesting $25
a month back into her business and she&#39;s
increased her sales by 35% and now in
the eyes of lending institutions we have
transformed Vijaya Lakshmi into a
credible consumer and a strong business
person with a great repayment ability
but it gets better
so suit now through the same process
that generates our credit scores insight
also provides our users with savings and
expense reports allowing them to make
better informed decisions on their
expenses and finances and what we&#39;ve
really created in a sense is now a daily
life accounting tool right now nine
months after launching our product we&#39;ve
back tested our scores against real
repayment data and we are 98% accurate
we&#39;ve created a system that brings
transparency and fairness to how we
score and understand the unbanked an
offline world with something as simple
as a credit score we are giving people
access to formal markets and giving them
the power to build their own future
and so if a score can do this much to
change an in deal in an individual life
imagine what a whole data set can do to
change the world thank you
