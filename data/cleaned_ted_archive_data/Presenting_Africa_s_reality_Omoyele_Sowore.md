good money I come from a country where
kids go missing a lot in the last 50
years we&#39;ve lost some five hundred
billion dollars from oil revenues
sometimes she&#39;s airplanes and even at
the time our president went missing in
Saudi Arabia for five months it is
reason why my favorite musician fella
Nicholasville cookie refers to my
country nigeria as vbc not BBC news for
big blinds country but some events
happened she must have had in Oprah&#39;s
first Nigeria&#39;s economy was recalculated
rebuild and recalibrated to become the
first and biggest economy in Africa so
fast in South Africa and you know in
Nigeria anytime we have little good news
we go out to party so now you know
fissures apart from orchestrating news
news as global news extent our
invitation letter everybody to come to
Abuja to party about our new economic
milestone but you know as the invitation
letters are going out events at the
wheel smashing up against each other a
group of militants arrived a secondary
school in north eastern nigeria and its
place called ship work went to the
school where students were taking final
exams and abducted over 250 girls in
Nigerian government on willing to deal
with this rude interruption of the party
in progress so well the abductions were
carried out as a result of
[Applause]
everywhere you go Nigeria follows you
yeah that&#39;s some epileptic power supply
affecting my microphone so unwilling to
do with this rude interruption of course
the Nigerian government studies
abduction was concocted to disrupt the
party in progress that is the
celebration of viacom mathematical
milestone and of course some people will
said it was meant to tend to the
repetition of the Nigerian President
Goodluck Jonathan so it fell upon those
of us in the social media sector new
reporters to report accurately that is
girls hadn&#39;t been abducted because the
military a digitally memo that the girls
had be released this is how the
situation of Nigeria has been because
some 15 years after the end of military
rule it was vibrate and vibrant Nigerian
media had compromised sir to the point
that it lends itself as mercenary to the
corrupt and authoritarian causes in
Nigeria that was why in 2006 I started
saharareporters as the citizens media
platform and the idea is very simple is
to use everybody who is willing to
liberate themselves from the clutches of
a media that went into remission by
itself to report news instantaneously
and accurately in a way that empowers
them so what did we do we decided that
we let the world know what is happening
out of Nigeria with the girls and the
reporting we did at that time false the
condition of the girls I&#39;ve been
abducted who by the way are still in
abduction as we speak to be recognized
as a primetime event around the world
and read about tons of hashtag
that is not known as bring back our
girls the girls have not been found but
we were able to force the global
community to focus on their condition
and hopefully we will find them and what
does this tell us it is to make people
understand that the power of media has
shifted the narrative of telling the
stories of the context of stories in
different parts of the world in
countries around the world especially in
Africa has shifted by way of the work we
do and regardless what of what anybody
tells you citizen journalism works
because you probably have seen the
mainstream media people saying no
citizen journalism doesn&#39;t work an
example is the man behind me his name is
James and an SAE boring used to be a
cashier at wiki&#39;s in London and has been
involved in petty stealing but somehow
he was able to forge a new passwords and
went back to Nigeria and found himself
politically in power again after he left
London and with finding himself in power
achieved never stop stealing they just
graduates so he looted the economy of
the state one of nigeria&#39;s wishes I
estate known as Delta State and with
that he was able to go back home to some
London and by pricey properties he both
looked furious cars even bought a
private jet and had eject witted I mean
they get delivered by two weeks late
because he wanted ipod jacqueline stored
on every street he wanted to capture his
own technological moments that&#39;s how
thieves are and with that before he
could get this bum ba da jet delivered
to him the asset had been frozen by a
London Court in boring sitting today in
jail in the UK sentence 13 years to jail
because of efforts of citizen reporters
records how did that happen it was
because in Nigerian citizen who worked
with us went to his garage in London and
found a Bentley sitting down there never
having been driven took a picture of it
and that give the whole country the
connection between the corruption as a
ravaging
bringing property to them and what miss
I buried it right but the sad part and
this is what is important is that why
I&#39;m is a boring sitting down in jail in
London or somewhere in UK the banks that
help him lose the economy of estate
we&#39;re not functioned or punished people
ask me also about a situation in Nigeria
recently where one of our Minister
raided the Treasury of an Aviation
agency em both to BMW cars beam as you
call them a mock-up for trade price that
it also has bought them for and her
efforts well most have contributed to
the air crashes you hear about in
Nigeria but what happened somebody uses
cell phone to take pictures of the
invoices and center odds we publish it
and this rumor was exposed but highest
was a that led to a lot of campaign in
the country did not lead us anywhere
until we found that actually has an MBA
on a CV in a university in the US that
did not exist and she also has a PhD
from another university in the US that
had closed down eventually street
protest legislative inquiries for
President Goodluck Jonathan to fire with
all due as the specimen long time
anybody was fired for corruption in
nigeria it happens in this year februari
we also do other things like monitoring
election in 2011 we obtain the results
of the presidential election 24 hours
before the election health is only
nigeria that that can happen right so
other questions that people ask me is
how do you verify your information how
do you decide which needs to publish and
how are you sure that you&#39;re breaking
news will not be wrong I&#39;ll tell you
that all of it is based on community we
have an army of citizen journalists who
are using devices that are available to
them to change the way business is done
and that provides instantaneous evidence
and I tell you that the kind of
journalism we do has given Africa needs
two revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt
and in my revolution in Nigeria where in
2012 Nigerians rose up against the
government in what we call occupy
Nigeria that struggle occupied Nigeria
led to the arrest and prosecution of the
oil cabada with stealing oil subsidies
made for Denari people in 2012 that
stool in 6.8 billion dollars worth of
oil subsidies and occupied Nigeria Falls
Nigeria president Juarez and start to
prosecute them don&#39;t ask me where the
prosecution went but we did our part and
we do fresh mundane things as following
the present i ran and ensuring that we
know the size of his delegation to the
United Nations which is the biggest in
the world we have to expose police
corruption police brutality and we do so
using photos text and videos
interactively to empower people and I
must say something to you that one of
the things that bedevil reporting about
Africa is how Africa is portrayed and
you know Africa&#39;s become a victim of
this caricature portray are in the
international media and people ask me
the same question in reporting
corruption are you not also portraying
Africa in a flattering way and the
answer is very simple that Africa has a
reality that we must deal with and it
includes good and bad things and what
this moment has given us a technological
moments where people can use their
devices to report it what I&#39;m saying is
that Africans should take control of
telling their own stories and it is up
to them how to tell their own stories
whether it is good or it is bad and I&#39;ll
say one last thing to all of you that
internet is the best thing that has
happened to humanity in recent times but
just like every innovation internet is
going through three stages it&#39;s going
through almost completed stage of
innovation it is now going through
almost completely dissed age of
imitation
and you must use it to further your
democratic purposes before it goes to
the last age when the idiots will try to
burn it down thank you for listening
you
