thank you and he won it in four minutes
so global warming is real and it&#39;s a
problem but we&#39;re not fixing it look at
co2 emissions they keep going up and up
and that&#39;s because renewable energy is
not yet ready so we need to find a
different way remember we have spent the
last couple centuries trying to get away
from renewables in 1800 we got almost
all of our renewables sorry you should
also just see that we got almost all of
our renewables or all of our energy from
renewables today we get just 1/3 of 1%
of our energy from solar and wind the
rest of the about 13% we get from water
and wood mostly in third world countries
so instead we try to push renewables
with taxes and subsidies but the problem
with taxes and especially energy taxes
is it hurts that especially the poor
with strong green policies in Britain
cost of heating have gone up 63 percent
of the past five years that means that
now there&#39;s 1 million elderly that are
struggling to keep warm in the winter
it&#39;s estimated that 2,700 of them die
each year and with subsidies remember
we&#39;ve heard ever since the seventies all
we just need a few more years of
subsidies and then we&#39;re good but the
truth is we&#39;ll keep paying more and more
the International Energy Agency estimate
that today the world pays a hundred and
1 billion dollars in subsidies to green
energy but in a generations time the
bill is not going to go down we will owe
two hundred and twenty three billion
dollars per year in subsidies to green
energy but there is a smarter way and
that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to talk about I
work with 27 of the world&#39;s top climate
economists and three Nobel laureates
they say the solution is about
innovation as it always was remember
back in the 1860s when we were hunting
whales almost to extinction because of
the very high quality light provided by
their oil the solution to that was not
to tax whales the solution was the
innovation of Kharis
that undercut the cost of whale oil by
90% and essentially saved the whales
whenever more horses were threatening to
inundate London in New York with manure
around 1900 the solution was not to
subsidize walking the solution was the
car and of course when the car then
later on went on to provide more air
pollution the solution again was an
innovation namely the catalytic
converter when India was starving in
1970 the solution was not to subsidized
food for every Indian the solution was
the Green Revolution their innovated
plant science to produce much more food
for every plot of land and so again the
solution to global warming is not
subsidies but it&#39;s to dramatically ramp
up investment in green innovation if we
could innovate the price of green energy
down innovate it down far enough and
everyone including China and India will
buy it ah
but surely you say subsidies is the way
to power that innovation well actually
not because all of our money or almost
all of our subsidy money we spend on
existing technology we spend on these
wind turbines that we already know are
not effective I mean it&#39;s really quite
simple if we want better technology we
should invest more in researchers and
that&#39;s why the Nobel laureates found
that for every dollar spent on current
policies on existing subsidies to solar
and wind will avoid about 3 cents of
climate damage that&#39;s a very poor way to
invest in the world but if we spent that
same dollar on researchers we could
actually avoid about 11 dollars of
climate damage we could make an amazing
difference and that&#39;s the real point
think of the 1950s we didn&#39;t get
computers because we subsidized vacuum
tubes we didn&#39;t get computers because we
next typewriters we got them because we
invested heavily in researchers that
developed the transistor the integrated
circuit and eventually the Mac and the
PC that we all want to buy and that&#39;s
why we need to say the following we need
to stop applauding our politicians for
spending hundreds of billions of dollars
on ineffective green policies instead
what we do need to do is to spend and
encourage them to dramatically ramp up
investment in green energy innovation
fundamentally if we can innovate the
price of green energy down below fossil
fuels we&#39;ll have one everyone will buy
it including China and India and that&#39;s
why innovation is the solution to global
warming just like it was for whales
horses and starving kids thank you hey
just a really quick question to you
though I think a lot of people don&#39;t
think there&#39;s a lot of logic to what you
just said but you&#39;re an economist if
carbon is a long term cost to the world
what we don&#39;t I a lot of people don&#39;t
understand why you wouldn&#39;t get behind a
carbon tax that was revenue neutral that
scent that scent that signal I said that
in my book we should have a carbon tax
than the cost of co2 which we estimating
is about $5 per ton globally but what we
have to remember is that&#39;s not going to
solve the problem it&#39;s in economically
efficient but there are two things wrong
with it first it&#39;s not going to solve
the problem it&#39;s going to cut a little
bit probably about five or ten percent
of global emissions but the second thing
that&#39;s the political issue you&#39;re not
going to get at most places actually
we&#39;ve seen it to be very very
politically divisive in Australia and
the u.s. it&#39;s very hard to imagine to
happen in China there many places where
they couldn&#39;t even afford it so the
problem I have we hope but you don&#39;t
like you calling publicly for it would
actually accelerate the chance and I&#39;ve
done that so let&#39;s just say that once
more yes carbon tax is a good idea but
the real point here is about green
innovation if we get green innovation
going we&#39;ll solve it thank you so much
going on well thank you
you
