hello everyone I&#39;m glad to be here I&#39;m
from Nigeria and I guess it was really
interesting one of my colleagues said
I&#39;m going to start where he stopped when
he said about just a Conrad the image of
Africa has did that continent and as a
kid growing up in Lagos no was this is
where I grew up and everything was
flying and I remember when I went
through at University in England and all
of a sudden saw all these images of
Africa and for me was like this is not
the Africa I grew up in the after I grew
up in was full of life optimism and all
these images resolve ourselves or that
have been documented about us where of
negativity and when you think of and I
realized the crucial Ness of photography
or images was that was images that the
Europeans were able to use the colonized
Africa because they had these images of
these Africans which were you know all
the anthropologist of the Africans
cutting themselves off or all these
protests images of us and I realized
that the only way we want to change that
is by us showing ourselves showing
different images of ourselves and well I
like to show you some of the stuff I&#39;ve
covered in a couple of years in the last
couple of years from music videos to
contemporary youth I&#39;m really interested
in youth culture in Africa because
that&#39;s one thing for example that close
of our politicians never quite give the
attentions we need it&#39;s all about the
big man the chief the minister but what
happened to the youth they are 60% of
our population and I wanted to like so
my all focused about youth culture and
just a celebration of our culture in a
different light
we&#39;ve got few music videos and a series
I directed for South African television
called user user which this episode or
this series actually dealt with Africa
the issue that youths face in Africa and
how they talk about it and well
please some hopefully enjoy

thank thank you very much and basically
uh as I was saying Elia is that about
doing images of ourselves that are very
positive and not to do it the constant
images you see about Africa the farming
the war I mean the kids there that care
about their features that talk about
issues that is really important to them
that really matters to them I had an
opportunity last year to travel across
the continent from Cape to Cairo and
basically photographing youth and
culture and celebration and most of
these are pictures that are going to
come on in a minute and this example
this was in Ivory Coast just when they
realized that they going to be in the
World Cup and our people were so excited
and this is in Ghana
basically what I personally try to do it
it really go into that and and and
basically the image I guess the top for
themselves
is that this interest is that women
coming from the football game in Senegal
and all dressed in their Sunday best or
Friday best our College
photographic studio in the car 1000 for
building in Legos as I did this a bunch
of our architect Nigel architects that
the government commissioned in the 70s
to create these buildings
thank you very much
and for me I think that which starts
time for horse to start looking at the
continent of Africa
in a different light and question
ourselves why these images why we being
given these negative images of all these
people oh there has to be more to the
continent that those things they kids
fall in love every day just like all
over the world people celebrate their
lives every day and I guess this for me
as a photographer and a filmmaker it&#39;s
about the colonizing colonial images of
us thank you very much
[Applause]
