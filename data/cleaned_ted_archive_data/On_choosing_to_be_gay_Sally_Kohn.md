okay thanks that was great all right
thank you everyone
so I recently wrote an essay in The
Washington Post about hoping that my
six-year-old daughter would grow up to
be gay this caused a little bit of
controversy probably some of which you
can imagine from for instance the
anti-gay folks who insisted I was trying
to recruit spoiler alert I am but also
from a lot of liberals gay and straight
who were like hold on there because
implied in my piece was the idea that my
daughter should be able to and in fact
encouraged to choose to be gay
which therefore implied that being gay
might be a choice this was by the way
the first time I had ever gotten hate
mail from gay folks all because I
basically said
thanks to the 26% of you who get the WAM
joke the rest of you can google that
later later
alright so I know what a lot of you are
thinking you&#39;re thinking
Sally you sound like one of those
right-wing homophobes who says being gay
is a choice the wrong choice and gay
people shouldn&#39;t get rights instead they
should choose to not be gay and I
understand why you might think that
because several decades ago when
anti-gay forces first started to insist
that being gay was a choice gay folks
and gay rights groups sort of
reflexively said no no no no no not a
choice no no it&#39;s uh it&#39;s fixed that&#39;s
it yes it&#39;s fixed and in fact we&#39;re born
gay yeah that&#39;s it and we&#39;re gonna look
for a gay gene even to try and prove it
and eventually someone named Lady gaga
will write a song about it in the
meantime the point is don&#39;t worry we&#39;re
not gonna make you gay we&#39;re not gonna
make your kids gay we&#39;re not gonna
change marriage or family we just want
to be included it was a version of
gayness deliberately designed not to
threaten the status quo but be tolerated
by it we&#39;re we&#39;re just like you only
gayer
now here&#39;s the problem with that what if
you think the status quo needs changing
what if if you don&#39;t want to fit into
the status quo what if you want to bust
it wide open when I started my career
working in the gay rights movement I
didn&#39;t think I was fighting for the
right to be like everybody else I
thought I was fighting for the right to
be different and still be treated
equally I didn&#39;t want to conform to some
heteronormative orthodoxy I wanted to
bust that orthodoxy wide open to
liberate sexuality and society for
everyone not just gay rights for some
but gender and sexual liberation for all
the idea is that everybody should be
more free to be themselves to be
different here&#39;s the thing today in the
United States for instance our laws and
our privileges around marriage to take
an example are based on this white very
white picket fence image of a working
dad stay-at-home mom and kids and listen
gay people should be able to be included
in that picture if they want to be but
the fact is four out of five Americans
don&#39;t live within that picket fence and
we shouldn&#39;t force families to conform
to some antiquated image we should
transform our laws and norms to
recognize and reflect the full diversity
of families and that means that single
parents and grandparents raising their
kids grandkids and gay families would
all be treated equally different and
equal the thing though is implicit in
the idea that there&#39;s something wrong
right it&#39;s subtle but it but it&#39;s very
clear in this idea that there&#39;s
something wrong with choosing to be gay
is the idea that it is not equal to be
gay that in fact it is like a pitiable
second-class status like oh poor her she
was born gay there there right but in a
world where it is 1000%
morally culturally socially and
politically acceptable to be gay equal
to being straight then it is one it
should be 1000% celebrated to be gay let
me say that again in a world where being
gay is 1,000% morally socially
culturally and politically equal to
being straight it should be celebrated
to be gay
whether you thank you whether you pop
out of the womb gay whether you become
gay lesbian bisexual or transgender in
kindergarten or out of women&#39;s college
happens or whether right now you just up
and decide to choose to be gay any
takers see me later uh
my point is if you have a problem with
the idea of choosing to be gay you
really have a problem with the idea of
being gay now there&#39;s some irony in all
of this because the most vocal forces
against gay equality are most definitely
making a choice because for instance
religion is a choice no one argues you
pop out of the womb presbyterian and in
fact the very notion of being a
born-again christian clearly implies it
didn&#39;t stick the first time more
importantly if you are choosing to
interpret your religious beliefs to be
anti-gay that is most definitely a
choice especially considering that the
majority of people the majority for
instance of christians do not choose
that interpretation it is very much a
choice now look I&#39;ve had a really great
gay life I have a supportive family my
whole my politics my engagement with the
world my whole career has been made
possible by seeing the world differently
and I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s that easy
for everyone in every corner of the
globe to be gay but I&#39;m saying it should
be it should be I&#39;m actually not even
saying I could choose to be straight I
don&#39;t know I&#39;ve never tried it but I am
saying all things being equal and
literally all people being treated
equally it would be a choice it should
be a choice this is the future of the
gay lesbian bisexual transgender
movement is it the future for all of us
choice the next generation
you know I guess it which means at the
end of the day I&#39;m not really recruiting
because I don&#39;t care if you all choose
to be gay but I do care that you have
the choice thank you
