I&#39;m in the stands of UCLA&#39;s Drake
Stadium along with my mom dad older
brother and sister I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m
having deja vu Drake Stadium was my
Mecca my training grounds in pursuit of
Olympic gold and I loved this Stadium I
love the way that my spikes bounced off
the astroturf as if I were running on
air I loved prepping from each by
putting cornrowed lightning bolts on the
side of my hair because cornrowed
lightning bolts are the only way to look
intimidating as a runner and more so
than anything
I loved winning but today we weren&#39;t
here for me we were actually here for
another member in my family my twin
brother Dwayne now a few months prior I
had been training I was a distance
runner cross-country track half mile and
in high school I was fast and thin and
lovingly referred to as the turbo
toothpick but now I was in college and
all the distance runners or turbo
toothpicks so instead of really focusing
on miles and cross-country
my coach really wanted me to focus on
the 50 because that for me was where the
race was really going to be won
so I&#39;m at Drake Stadium I&#39;m doing these
50s over and over and over again my body
is getting tighter I&#39;m getting tenser
I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen I&#39;m
getting 10 sir and tighter and all of a
sudden I feel like somebody&#39;s shot me
and I go flying face down onto the track
I&#39;m screaming and agony and pain and
athletic trainers run over it&#39;s not a
good look I had restrained a previously
torn quad I was having spasms in my back
and this was the end of my running
career I was devastated
this was the destruction of my dream I
mean I had to draw a picture of what I
was going to do with my life
that would have been a skinny black girl
with corner of lightning bolts preparing
for the Olympic
and if I had to draw another picture I
would have drawn a blank so of course I
was feeling something when I&#39;m like
looking down at the stadium because this
isn&#39;t the Olympics this is the Special
Olympics because my twin brother Dwayne
has Down syndrome and growing up track
and field and the Special Olympics were
always the way that we connected so as
much as I wanted to be the one on that
field it almost felt serendipitous that
Dwayne was there because if I couldn&#39;t
win gold Dwayne and Shirley would
and out of all of the places that the
Special Olympics could be having their
state championships it was gonna be
happening at UCLA this was gonna be our
source of redemption
so Dwayne&#39;s race to the 200 yard dash he
lines up and they say all right runners
on your mark get set go
and Dwayne is gone at first I can&#39;t
really tell who&#39;s winning as I come
around the bend but as I got to the 100
I see that Dwayne is way ahead he is
going to win this race I am so excited I
am so amped he&#39;s at the 90 he&#39;s up to 80
the 50 the 40 he&#39;s about to win this
he&#39;s at the 30 and right when he&#39;s about
to finish then cross the finish line
he&#39;s stopping short and he&#39;s looking
back and he&#39;s like looking at the other
runners like he wants to help that I&#39;m
like no way no just blending I&#39;ve know
runners go which is like the most
inappropriate thing to be yelling at the
Special Olympics
and two or three people boards oming
right past them and he gingerly just
waits for the guy and last to cross the
finish line with him and as he does
i am i yelled out from the stands Dwain
and he sees me and he looks up and he&#39;s
like hey Don
and in that moment I so badly wanted to
tap into any kind of mind-reading powers
that twins are supposed to have I mean
what was he thinking was was gold just
for suckers you know I mean was he
confused he see something behind him
until I saw him walk over and hug the
other Special Olympics volunteers and
the other athletes and I realized wow he
simply did that because he cares my
entire life I thought that Dwayne and I
were on the same mission to finish first
with Dwayne&#39;s mission was to make sure
that everyone&#39;s finished period clearly
somebody had gotten the memo on good
sportsmanship and it wasn&#39;t me for the
first time in my life I started seeing
that Dwayne&#39;s focus had always been on
putting other people first
well my first niece was born he would
hold her so gingerly and tightly and so
sweet
where I was really cautious as if I was
gonna like break her and when Dwayne
hugs somebody in our family he&#39;s never
the first to let go in those moments I
was the one with the need and I think
that people think of Dwayne as only in
terms of his needs but I see him as
having special gifts gifts of courage of
compassion it&#39;s a commitment
and I think that we all have special
needs and we all have special gifts but
if we take a moment to think about those
with Down syndrome and other
disabilities see the beauty for the
things that they have in abundance and
look at the concept of needs and gifts
as a shared universal experience well
within those moments I believe lies true
gold thank you
