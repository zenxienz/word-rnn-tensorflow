when I finished Business School in 2000
I was a total idealist convinced the
business could change the world for the
better and I couldn&#39;t make that happen
so I joined BP which made sense at the
time because the company was run by John
Brown Brown had just become the first
head of a major energy company to
acknowledge that climate change was real
and urge action I fell in love with that
company I worked in Indonesia in China
with colleagues around the world
consulting with local communities
working with human rights and
environmental groups I worked on
projects where even the most hard nosed
engineers understood how important human
rights and community concerns were to
the success of the business
I loved big oil and then on April 20th
2010 the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded
in the Gulf of Mexico killing 11 men and
wreaking havoc around the Gulf and
beyond I have left the company two years
earlier but I watched in horror as this
very different BP emerged in the press
and in the hearings one that was callous
and reckless it was the opposite of the
BP that I thought I knew so well so how
could this happen in a company that in
my experience went above and beyond what
was required by law anywhere to protect
people and protect the environment did
my nine years of work make any
difference at all to try to answer those
questions I started talking to people
I&#39;ve gotten to know over the years doing
similar work in other companies
particularly where things have gone
wrong at Yahoo the Gap coca-cola and I
realized that we face so many common
challenges and frustrations and that our
story needed to be told because I also
got really frustrated with the public
conversation after every corporate
disaster
oh great another evil company full of
greedy and evil people which isn&#39;t true
and also leads us towards solutions that
are just about getting the bad guys
there is a global invisible army of
corporate idealist like me working deep
inside big companies every day trying to
prevent some of the very disasters that
ended up in suing they&#39;re trying to find
that sweet spot where the interests of
business and the interests of society
align we have to reframe the
conversation and focus on them we have
to understand why did they fail and what
they need in order to succeed so here
are some of the themes that emerged from
those conversations one is no one gets
rewarded for what doesn&#39;t happen a lot
of corporate safety and ethics work is
about preventing bad things from
happening
and you know that&#39;s hard to reward for
one supply chain manager who I talk to
you who works for a big multinational
told me how one of her colleagues won
one of the company&#39;s internal awards for
managing a big safety disaster and she
was livid she was like are you kidding
me I prevented like 20 of those but it&#39;s
hard to reward for that second theme is
that few executives bear witness to the
impacts of their decisions on people and
communities at the far ends of their
supply chain which makes it easier to do
things that hurt them the International
Labor Standards team at Disney arranged
for Disney CFO to go visit factories in
China where Disney branded products were
made they saw some good factories and
they saw some not so nice ones and that
trip has helped the team continue to
gain support for their work third theme
people why more than one person told me
a story of visiting a factory and then
doubling back saying
they drop their notebook and seeing all
the workers turning in their goggles or
their face masks so that they could be
kept nice and clean in a box factory
owners lie not because they&#39;re evil not
because they like exploiting people but
because they think that failing one
audit means a losing business some
brands are moving towards longer term
relationships with suppliers to try to
change that behavior but in the mean
time people lie ok those three themes
are kind of a bummer but it wasn&#39;t all
negative
a former Gap employee told me about
visiting suppliers in India and at the
end of a long day the guy showing him
around said I want to take you to one
more that&#39;s not on your list it supplies
the domestic market and he said they
walked into this residential high-rise
walked up a few stories into this room
and it was filthy there is a kid working
one of the machines and I asked him how
did you feel when you saw that and he
said actually it was one of the moments
where I felt like all the work that
we&#39;re doing is making a difference
because of the factories we source from
today look like that 20 years ago we
have made progress and that for me was
the real punchline was this theme of
incremental ISM of knowing that we are
working on the toughest issues at the
heart of globalization that no one
person or team or company can solve
overnight but we are moving business in
the right direction I obviously did not
manage to transform all of BP I
obviously didn&#39;t even get to know all of
BP but I know I made a difference to
those workers and those communities
around the projects that I did work on
which is tens of thousands of people if
not more and that&#39;s not bad
though I know it&#39;s not good enough the
poet WH Auden wrote there is a great
deal of difference between believing
something&#39;s still and believing it again
having had my heart broken by Big Oil I
have come back around to believing that
business can
be a force for good in the world but I
know that&#39;s not going to happen by
accident companies have to reward
prevention remove incentives to lie and
bear witness and the rest of us have to
reward the behavior that we want to see
and recognize that there is a community
of corporate idealists out there who
need our attention and support we all
need them to succeed I am no longer that
girl who fell in love with Big Oil
fifteen years ago but I am a corporate
idealist thank you
