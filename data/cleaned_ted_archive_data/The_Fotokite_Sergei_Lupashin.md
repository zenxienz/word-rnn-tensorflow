there&#39;s a box I came here to show you
something called the photo kite it&#39;s in
this box the box shall be opened but
first let me tell you what is fired this
project where it comes from so in 2011
Russian Federal Elections happened there
were irregularities people came out in
masses to protest very unusual for
Russia unfortunately mostly ignored by
the world media for whatever reasons a
group of photographers that for a hobby
they run a website called air pano calm
very cool check it out usually they take
photos aerial photos of wildlife of
heritage sites very beautiful they came
out and to document the protests they
just took one or two shots from 20
meters from 100 meters let me show you
the the resultant shots are literally
eye-opening so just from the single
image it&#39;s from about 20 meters high you
see just the the mass of people the
colors the banners it&#39;s just not
possible to consider this event it&#39;s
significant visual evidence and I think
in the future journalism and actually
many other professions will see these
tools as a requirement as a given but
there are some fundamental barriers to
make this perspective truly accessible
one is training so that&#39;s the vehicle
that the air pad know people use it&#39;s a
3 kilo hexacopter with a 3 kilo payload
6 kilos in the air quite dangerous takes
a lot of skill a lot of concentration to
operate actually if you take a look at
the back of his shirt it says all
questions after landing in english and
in russian
people are very curious they tap you on
the shoulder crash bad so and these guys
are professionals they&#39;re very good at
what they do they have a lot of
experience but this is a very high
barrier of entry to access this unique
perspective another problem is
regulations and privacy concerns so for
many very good reasons it&#39;s very tough
to come up with common-sense laws to
regulate this technology there&#39;s a whole
spectrum of vehicles for example in F in
the US the FAA has actually pushed to
make these things illegal for commercial
use this is slowly changing but it&#39;s a
very complicated situation but there&#39;s
another way to access these perspectives
it&#39;s with the tether with a line with a
leash in fact if you look at the FAA
proposal for integrating UAS unmanned
aerial vehicles in the US airspace they
say the tethered vehicle is actually not
an unmanned aircraft which actually
makes sense once you think about it
because the story is different it&#39;s it&#39;s
like a kite so the safety situation is
different you know exactly who is
responsible for it it&#39;s just a very
different vehicle but apart from that it
opens up a whole new way to actually
build these things to interact with them
to use them and I think at this point I
should just open the box
okay what do you see it looks like a
quadrocopter it&#39;s actually called a
photo kite and I&#39;ll show you why it&#39;s
different in the moment it&#39;s very
lightweight very small to actually fly
it here I brought a special version
which has a bit more protection so again
this is very lightweight it&#39;s protected
feel very safe the way you use it is you
turned on you point us in the direction
you want to fly there is a gesture to to
actually interact with it provided son
there we go so it spins up the motors
and there it goes and the way this works
there&#39;s actually a leash it&#39;s a dog
leash the way this works is that the
vehicle can figure out where it is
relative to me its users user centric
and maintains the same angle no matter
what happens so if I take a step right
it will actually naturally follow me and
maintain the same angle and this is
quite a neat interface remember there&#39;s
no remote control involved in fact I can
just go ahead and grab a second one
again turned on
so imagine that you&#39;re a journalist or
if you&#39;re a scientist or you&#39;re an
archaeologist you can now access this
perspective directly without a pilot
without certification let me let you
third one just to make it a bit more
interesting FYI live demos are hard one
second so again I pointed in the
direction I want to go there it goes I
let&#39;s stop it right there perfect
there&#39;s a live feed from each of these
so you can now imagine if you&#39;re coming
to respond to a breaking news story or
you&#39;re trying to do science you&#39;re
trying to observe animals you now have
this very direct tool that you can
actually use yourself to access those
perspectives and my real question to you
now is if you had this what do you would
you do with it I gave you some examples
that I think would change with this tool
and I&#39;ve got to hear that Thank
you
