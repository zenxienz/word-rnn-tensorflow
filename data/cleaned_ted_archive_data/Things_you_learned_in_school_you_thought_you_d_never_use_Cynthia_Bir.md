thank you so how many of you guys have
set in your science class and thought
I&#39;m never going to use any of this stuff
ever nice yeah alright yeah ok I was
there at one point in time too but I can
tell you as a scientist and as a
biomedical engineer the things that I
learned way back in junior high in high
school I use today and I use them both
in my lab as well as to explain some
kind of fun concept in a scientific way
so I want to talk about trajectories
today so I&#39;m just going to take one of
those topics of trajectories and tell
you a little bit how we kind of make it
fun so this is a treble shake
everybody&#39;s kind of familiar with those
the bow and arrow we have a ballistic
cannon and we have basketball players so
in the field of sports we do a lot of
things in terms of looking at
trajectories basketball players baseball
players golfers they all rely on
trajectories to make their shots so
let&#39;s look at basketball a little closer
so when you actually pass the basketball
there&#39;s two components that happen the
ball though you may be like this but
there&#39;s a vertical and a horizontal
component so our vertical component
looks like this and our horizontal
component like this now something that&#39;s
interesting if you look at this I didn&#39;t
screw up the vertical components are
closer together at the top right and the
horizontal components are evenly spaced
does anybody know why that happened yes
acceleration increases because of
gravity right the vertical component has
gravity acted upon it so it&#39;s not going
to be evenly spaced like the horizontal
component but together they form this
motion so let&#39;s start to look at what
happens when we actually add an angle so
this is just throwing it directly
outward what if we add an angle so let&#39;s
say we have a 30-degree vector and that
vector has a direction and magnitude so
we have this vector here we have it at
30 degrees to perform our trajectory if
we break it into its y and X component
we can start to analyze it a little
closer so our Y component has this
equation that can describe it so at any
given
point in time T we can make we know
exactly where the y position is of that
ball and you notice there&#39;s a gravity
component in the Y we&#39;re with the Act
there is no gravity component so it&#39;s
evenly spaced at all points in time what
we can use these equations for are
things like will the ball go over a
fence well we can calculate that because
we can calculate the peak point of why
and we&#39;ll know whether it will clear the
fence will it go all the way to the
basket that we needed to go to we can
calculate that because we can calculate
the range basically in the simplest form
we can look at the different angles so
we can say 30 45 60 and we&#39;ll get
different trajectories what are the cool
things to note is that even though 45
gives you the tallest or the ones the
middle taller than 30 and it gives you
the biggest range when you go to 60 you
actually get a taller trajectory but the
range is the same as 30 because those
two angles complement each other&#39;s are
complementary angles and so you end up
having the same range so by having the
launch angle and the velocity we can
calculate the output in terms of range
in height which is great because then we
can start to look at things like
shooting a basketball so let&#39;s take a
look at what does Kobe Bryant think
during the game what&#39;s going through his
mind which makes no shot you think this
is going through his mind probably not
right with Jamie&#39;s just kind of learned
over the years how to make those shots
but we can use equations like this to
know exactly what velocity and launch
angle we need to actually make the shot
and I&#39;m not going to go through all this
math but I&#39;m going to show you a clip
from a show called sport science that I
helped as a technical advisor on and it
kind of goes through and describes how
we did this for Kawhi Leonard&#39;s so let&#39;s
take a look at this clip back then Kawhi
also typically release the ball at an
angle of around 45 degree 45 degree
angles as the block a directory can
reduce the shooters
margin of error approaching the basket
all of our targets are you delaying the
piglet hi tech center summer hit high as
yours kawaii leave am sunny 2012 and a
runner man you see one degree that the
51 degree rayleigh tango is the best
angle for his height and the ball height
is AB average height by almost nineteen
percent he only make it out angles from
15 feet that it is bizarre ring and
glide insistently may Jesus long speed
to lock with each so that&#39;s our lives
love in a single person those are the
things that we can do with either high
speed video or like I said that
particular basketball has a ray of
sensors in it that allows us to make
those measurements but you can also make
those measurements on paper like I said
going back to this equation is so let&#39;s
say you&#39;re out shooting hoops and you&#39;re
using all these equations but you
actually move to the side this is like a
planar right this is everything done in
one plane 2d motion let&#39;s look at 3d
let&#39;s say but you&#39;re in front of the
hoop and you know you&#39;re at the
three-point line you&#39;re in an NC
double-a game and your 3-point lines
19.75 feet what happens if you turn just
five degrees so we just turned the ball
five degrees in the other direction what
happens we&#39;re way off at the basket
right so how how far do you think that
is right at the basket if we&#39;re it was
19 72 75 feet away and we only turned
five degrees how what do you think our
margin of error is there 20 feet
actually we can calculate this right
because we can take the opposite over
the adjacent which is tangent right
everybody&#39;s tellin sine cosine tangent
this is our geometry and we can
calculate our acts our X actually ends
up being one point seven three feet so
we&#39;re off by a lot that&#39;s when everybody
goes air ball right you don&#39;t even hit
so what I want to do is I want to
challenge the teachers out there to use
creative ways to take some of these math
concepts and make some fun for kids but
I also want to challenge you guys to
think of creative ways when you&#39;re
learning some of these
that you can apply to kind of your
everyday world to kind of make them make
sense and have them be more fun so thank
you
