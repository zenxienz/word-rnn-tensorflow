like a lamb to slaughter really I&#39;m
gonna speak for the NSA now it&#39;s all
gonna be okay I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m
going to say so my family left the their
little village in Belarus the border of
Russia in Poland in 1932 you could say
they fled
you know the adorable Shack and the
delightful pogrom you know one too many
that&#39;s enough of that and they took this
ship the Polonia bound for Palestine now
Israel and on the ship there was an epic
event a sailor gave my mother and orange
which became the stuff of legend in my
family
sailor orange and I just wanted to say
that his epic events going this summer
I&#39;m going to go on a trip on the Lewis
and Clark trail in a Volvo not a canoe
of course and without secretary with
Google and I&#39;m going to try to document
every Napoleon Nazi you know idiotic
stuio but the desert and hopefully have
a map of all the Napoleon&#39;s because we
have a lot of we haven&#39;t like to thank
him for
so they came to Tel Aviv which was
Bauhaus and you know flooded with
thousands and thousands of Zionists and
refugees and tangos and cafes and
bookstores and the beautiful
Mediterranean and they lived a difficult
but really wonderful life at the same
time in the early 30s Bronislaw Huberman
who was a polish violinist realized that
it was critical for the jewish for the
jews to get at but get the hell out of
there and convince several hundred
musicians Jewish musicians and their
families to come to Palestine and form
the Palestine Philharmonic at the same
time Arturo Toscanini the flamboyant and
tempestuous conductor pictured here with
the scala director a scala director
kakuka Zaza
and if you know you should say that a
few times every morning gotti Kasasa is
such a wonderful name anyway Toscanini
was then taking a stand against fascism
is saying he refused to go to Germany
and perform for Hitler and he was really
getting on muscley knees nerves vexing
him tremendously so there was a lot of
tension going on in Huberman invited
Toscanini to come to Tel Aviv and
conduct the inaugural concert of the
newly formed Palestine Philharmonic and
he did here they are in Tel Aviv
performance included Rossini and Brahms
and Schubert and it advertised coffee
and eggs something that you usually see
in the you know the Metro you know the
Met programs these days it was December
1936 it was a tremendous success and it
was an epic event in this time in this
turbulent time in Toscanini wore that
suit those pants and that jacket by the
way Toscanini&#39;s son-in-law was vladimir
horowitz one of the greatest pianists of
the 20th century and my personal
fantastic idol we left Tel Aviv in 1954
and came to the land of TV and coca-cola
clearly this was like our big moment
when we we sent photos to our family and
this
of our great TV but we also had a really
culture stuffed life we had I had
counter lessons and ballet lessons we
went to Carnegie Hall we went to the Met
and at the same time the Toscanini was
there as well he so we had moved to the
Braun
to Riverdale in the Bronx and that&#39;s
where Toscanini came leaving Europe also
hearing is pictured with his grandson
more Fredo and he while Fredo is
important in this story but anyway they
moved to to the Bronx into a place not
exactly the same kind of place that we
lived in and we saw they lived in wave
Hill in this mansion and we live next to
bosun Chinese restaurant and mothers
they Korean liebman&#39;s deli but you know
not that dissimilar and actually I often
think that when might when we first came
to America and I had my first shrimp
cocktail at Stella d&#39;Oro
I thought clearly the the heavens would
open and I would be dead in five minutes
but instead I just had a delicious
shrimp cocktail and I also I always
think that maybe Toscanini was also
sitting next to me having a delicious
shrimp cocktail so there he is
frolicking in wave Hill in his 30 acre
estate
I continued piano lessons and I went to
the High School of Music in art to study
music and and was in the chorus and was
a glorious experience we always said to
each other when anybody wanted to meet
anybody meet you at Ruskin Eenie so he
was this fixture in the lobby of our
room and then last year I was reading in
the newspaper that while fredo his
grandson had died and the entire
Toscanini estate was going to be sold
sofas and silverware and all the
artifacts of his life which interested
me not at all but they were also selling
his pants the same pants that he wore to
conduct the Palestine Philharmonic so I
was there in a second I was really
really nervous I thought this is not
going to happen
these anti-nazi anti-fascist love of
Vladimir Horowitz who I&#39;m sure sat on
his lap once in a while
and other people that they you know
other other people touch those pants and
in various ways and I really felt that I
had to have them and it was important
that I have them but I was sure I
wouldn&#39;t get them in the bidding was
fierce and it was really really tense
but there is a good thing that happens
in this world and I here I am have them
I don&#39;t know how he would feel but here
they are
