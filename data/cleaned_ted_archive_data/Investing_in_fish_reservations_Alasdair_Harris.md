take less get more it sounds like a
paradox but it&#39;s actually the rationale
behind an investment opportunity that
gives me hope for our oceans if you&#39;ve
heard about the sea recently it was
probably bleak news fish stocks
collapsing ocean acidification mass
extinction but there is a grassroots
movement out there with a different
story to tell it&#39;s a story that begins
with a breathtaking these simple device
for rebuilding fisheries I&#39;m talking
about marine reserves think of a marine
reserve as a natural investment bank
within which we protect our stock our
investment from fishing fish grow and
spawn inside accumulating with interest
eventually there&#39;s so much life inside
the reserves that pioneers start to
venture beyond its boundaries spilling
into our fishing nets outside and
ultimately that interest that&#39;s the
pioneers spilling over may exceed our
initial savings deposit the fish that
were in there to start with that&#39;s all
because of one of the great wonders of
the natural world as fish grow their
fertility explodes in a very nonlinear
way so modest growth leads to a colossal
leap in fertility the longer we leave
fish in the reserve the bigger they grow
in the bigger they grow the more their
fertility sores giving us a surge in
fish and larvae that spill out of our
reserve to replenish our fishing grounds
year after year indefinitely now these
returns are so effective that if we can
scale up protection to around a third of
our oceans we&#39;re in with a chance of
rebuilding fish stocks worldwide but two
problems stand in our way of meeting
that thirty percent target firstly our
seas are now so depleted that interest
rates start low and we&#39;re fishing means
survival as for these nomadic visio
people in the Mozambique Channel the
opportunity cost of waiting for that
dividend is simply not a viable option
secondly we have a scale problem today
with fully protecting less than one
percent of our seas we need a radically
new approach to the way we incentive
eyes and finance marine conservation to
fund that 30 fold expansion of
protection that we need to safeguard our
seas and I&#39;ve spent the last 14 years
here in the Indian Ocean looking for one
it just so happens that some species can
recover phenomenally quickly with
protection like this tropical octopus
that grows at exponential rates octopus
gleaned on coral reefs here in
Madagascar are exported all the way to
Europe one species underpinning an
entire coastal economy in a place where
fishing is the only job on offer where
fishing is survival a decade ago catches
here was starting to collapse the
outlook wasn&#39;t good one village decided
to set aside a small area of the reef
where they normally catch octopus for
just a few months to see what would
happen now I want you to imagine that
you&#39;re a Malagasy fisherwoman used to
landing octopus under a kilo on a good
day your whole family might catch 5
kilos fetching you two or three dollars
to feed seven people now imagine how it
feels when you pull a bigger octopus out
of the water not two or even three times
the usual size imagine an octopus ten
times the size at eight kilos people saw
and people talked soon neighbors were
replicating this model and in a decade
it&#39;s gone viral along hundreds of miles
of coast it&#39;s growing every year it
spawned new fishing legislation crossed
international borders and is now being
adopted to other fisheries in the Indian
Ocean this model yields real monetary
profits with a monthly internal rate of
return of 92% exceeding any financial
product on the market so these guys are
earning more from fishing less but this
isn&#39;t conservation this is fisheries
management we weren&#39;t doing this for
conservation but to improve food
security in a place where over half of
children are malnourished but in the
process people saw what was possible
that they themselves could rebuild their
fisheries
and now something quite remarkable is
happening following this model these
same villages have started raising the
bar creating permanent marine reserves
within vast locally managed conservation
areas in just eight years sixty three of
these areas have been established around
the coast of Madagascar alone this is a
local marine conservation revolution
being driven not by government but by
communities and now on a scale exceeding
one and a half million football pitches
around the western Indian Ocean Village
by village with we&#39;re learning that
conservation doesn&#39;t need to be about
taking less because it can be one of the
highest yielding investment
opportunities on the planet it&#39;s already
working for quarter of a million people
here in Madagascar and this is just the
beginning one and a half billion of us
live around our tropical coasts
including some of the world&#39;s poorest
people dependent on our richest yet most
threatened marine biodiversity my
mission is to help more of us learn from
pioneers like Madagascar&#39;s octopus
fishers that taking less from our oceans
really does give us much much more thank
you
