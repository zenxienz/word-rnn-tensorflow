I&#39;m a neuroscientist which means I had
to go to grad school for over five years
just to be able to ask questions about
the brain because the only way you could
actually do experiments in neurosciences
you actually go to grad school and work
in a research lab because the equipment
is so expensive and so complicated that
it&#39;s only found in research labs like in
universities but it&#39;s not like that in
other fields of science if you think if
you want to learn about the planets you
can just go to your local store you can
pick up a cheap telescope bring it back
home put that up in your backyard and
you can start within a few nights
you know exploring the heavens but the
point is you don&#39;t have to get a PhD to
do that right but you have to get a PhD
and to do this in neuroscience because
there are no tools like that and that&#39;s
a shame because one out of five of us
has 20% of the entire world be diagnosed
with the neurological disorder and we
have no known cures for these diseases
and so we should be making tools
available to get people interested in
neuroscience and so when I was in grad
school my lab mate Tim Marzullo and
myself came up with this idea that what
if we took all this complicated
equipment it made it simple enough and
affordable enough that you could teach
neuroscience all the way down may even
to the fifth grade level and so for the
past three years we&#39;ve been doing man so
we have we build equipment and
experiments that can do
electrophysiology in the high school
classroom electrophysiology ziz the
recording of living nervous system
tissue and so we do this not by
recording the brains of the students or
the brains of the teachers but by the
brains of these guys right here
and this guy is if I can get him out a
beautiful South American cockroach even
though it looks like it can fly he
actually cannot flies a little bit too
heavy and I&#39;m gonna pass it over to Tim
because just in a moment we&#39;re gonna be
doing some experiments that we would
normally do in the high school classroom
but I want to show you guys how it works
and just before I want to say we just I
just made these calm
about the human brain and I&#39;m now I
pulled out a cockroach what why am i
doing that
it turns out that our brain has 100
billion cells called neurons the
cockroach brain has about a million
cells but if you look at the individual
neurons themselves are very very similar
between the two species so you have a
cell body that reaches out to reach out
towards another neuron and that long arm
that reaches out to called an axon it&#39;s
down this axon that electrical impulses
come down these are called spikes and
it&#39;s ooh these spikes that all
information is passed in the brain it&#39;s
the common currency of the brain it&#39;s
sort of the Euro of the brain if you
will and so how does the how does the
cockroach actually use this so let&#39;s
look at one example is antennas so the
cockroach just uses the antenna to sort
of navigate the world right if you look
at the antenna sit covered with hairs if
you look at each hair it has neurons
inside of it what are those neurons
telling the brain it&#39;s telling it like
things that it touches or things that it
sort of the chemicals it&#39;s almost like a
nose that it&#39;s sensing back in and so
through this it could navigate it so
what would happen if you those
electrical impulses are coming back down
there but you suck us very small wire
inside the antenna so that is the
experiment we&#39;re going to do right now
we should be able to listen in and hear
the activity of the of the neurons and
so we&#39;re gonna go back to Tim who has
hooked up we have a connector on them
onto the the cockroach where we&#39;ve
plugged into the the antennas and if we
can listen we turn up so outside the
house you can hear this this little
humming it said people tell me it sounds
like raindrops I hear that a lot I hear
often that it sounds like popcorn
popping but this is actually what&#39;s
happening inside your brain these are
the neurons that are inside that antenna
but also the same neurons that are
inside of you and so you&#39;re actually
listening to what your own brain sounds
like so all of your thoughts your dreams
your hopes your desires everything is
encoded within these spikes and so
remember like in the in the matrix when
you saw like all that coding oh my god
that&#39;s really well
people this is reality right here the
spikes is everything that you know okay
so let&#39;s go back to the slides for a
second I want to say one more thing
about what how the cockroach uses these
information
okay so the cockroach has these antennas
like I said he navigates the world with
that right and so if if you were
watching a cockroach walk down the
street and something touches this
left-hand side it&#39;s going to turn and
walk to the right but if it&#39;s walking
then it something touches the right-hand
side turns to walk to the left that&#39;s
the nature of the cockroach so how does
it do that because there&#39;s a neuron
inside the antenna and the antenna
that&#39;s sending the information back to
the brain right what if we had that thin
wire that was in there instead of
recording the electricity we sent a
little pulse of electricity to cause
that neuron to fire the cockroach would
think that it was touching something and
should turn in the opposite direction so
ladies and gentlemen we are about to
introduce the very first time we&#39;ve done
this prototype is called the roboroach
is our latest invention and we are going
to hook it up to an iPhone and so when
you pair it to the Bluetooth of your
iPhone you can then send a small pulse
to the backpack which goes into either
the left or the right antenna and it
will turn it and so here we go and tim
is gonna let it go and he&#39;s gonna turn
to the left alright if you turn to the
right he&#39;s but confused I should&#39;ve left
to the right perfect
alright so ladies and gentlemans is the
world&#39;s first commercially available
cyborg in the history of mankind and so
why are we doing this type of stuff I
mean like why would you make a cyborg
but it turns out this is the exact same
technologies that&#39;s being used to treat
Parkinson&#39;s disease with deep brain
stimulation or cochlear implants for for
deafness and so if by getting these
tools into the hands of kids we could
actually start to begin the neuro
Revolution thank you
Wow so well well we well we set up for
some music so I can use alright that&#39;s
profit all that a couple questions I&#39;m
just guessing that there&#39;s at least one
person out in this audience who&#39;s going
really you&#39;re doing that to one of God&#39;s
beautiful creation oh now we get we get
this a lot so there&#39;s a couple things I
want to point out which I wasn&#39;t very
clear about this is this is micro
stimulation so this is not like a
painful response so like people they
think it&#39;s being shocked what it turns
around but it&#39;s actually not and so we
can tell a number of different ways of
why this is the case but one of the
things that this cockroach should adapt
very quickly so after about a minute it
won&#39;t will stop turning
whereas if we&#39;re like this this project
actually started through DARPA it was
used for a remote control type of insect
but it turns out that it adapts pretty
quickly and so for engineering it&#39;s not
very good but for neuroscientists it&#39;s
really good because the brain adapts
it&#39;s what it does it&#39;s a great teaching
tool wait wait wait it started with
DARPA so how many how many Robo roaches
could you fit on a quadcopter yes well
that&#39;s a good question we could we could
work on that sir that sounds like the
plot of quite a bad movie I&#39;m just
getting my head but but do it taking
this to school your experiences that you
inspire kids with kids excited so we
have had beta versions of this product
out for for a number of years now this
has been three years in the making this
this this particular roboroach and so
one of the things that we do is we we
look at the frequencies at which you
stimulate and so we we fixed at the same
thing that we use for like deep brain
stimulation 55 Hertz but some students
at a high school figured out that if you
they played their iPods into there they
can get the roach not to adapt as
quickly and so that got us thinking like
way if we randomized the signals and so
these are discoveries that are being
made from high schools that we&#39;ve
actually now rolled into our latest
version so these are like I think
starting to starting to happen this
neural revolution well one thing Sutton
is I&#39;m pretty sure that you have the
attention of every kid when you do that
so
no animals were irretrievably harmed in
the making of this TED talk yeah no so
the backpacks come off and they go back
and they do whatever cockroaches do they
made the eaten whatever they do Greg
thank you thank you so much thank you
Chris thank you
