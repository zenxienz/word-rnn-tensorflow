Kant is such a miserable experience and
an exciting experience for me because I
have to be writing notes all the time
and then even up until the time I&#39;m
onstage I&#39;m rapping to write notes so
now the top of my notes I just have to
write about the people who addressed
their oXXO Elon Musk when he was talking
about the automated cars one of the
things I learned at Ted this year is
that it&#39;s not going to make traffic less
it&#39;s going to make traffic worse and
that I mean I just have maybe you did -
I just have this idea in my head that it
was going to be so much less traffic and
that&#39;s why I automated cars are going to
be so great and now I&#39;ve learned from
this conference no these cars are going
to be just like another room in their
house you&#39;re going to be able to pull
whatever you want in it to read or
whatever and then I started thinking of
God you know in LA it&#39;s probably going
to be children have their prostitutes
meet them in their car so they can have
sex on their way to work but then I got
an idea that maybe this is a way for
Ford to have a new launch of the Ford
Escort all right I&#39;ll subscribe you on
my phone I was writing that note down I
space down a minute and then I looked up
and I saw that he was about to build the
world&#39;s biggest dildo what I&#39;m assuming
is going to vibrate all right
the World Bank guy because we&#39;ve been
hearing so much about how horrible all
the songs are then when he put that
picture of all the kids looking at the
cell phone I was like a sad picture it&#39;s
like all those poor kids are having to
look at the cell phone and he was
talking about all the out for a tional
stuff I thought he was going to say we
can&#39;t let poor people I&#39;m so close
because we&#39;re going to find out about
the rest of it okay but he didn&#39;t go
there all right this is how I was good
start
new start um the Pope in a rabbi walk
into a TED Conference and I&#39;m going to
both of them but not before say a few
things first okay my overall comments
about Ted okay I just want to say a big
thank you to Google to donate the
cardboard VR glasses that we use last
year so that they could turn them into
the snacks this year
so nice exam super good facility Jim but
I did occurred to me I&#39;m here I realize
the Canadian Geese are just quiche let&#39;s
just eat all right now we started with
the dancer and the robot and I was
thinking the whole time what I always
think of when I&#39;m watching beautiful
dancers oh my god their bodies are so
amazing it&#39;s incredible their bodies can
be that way and I actually found myself
thinking I think that robot has zero
body fat I mean nothing ok now I move
this guy up to the front because he sort
of inspired my whole talk the and oh by
the way everybody is not a name people
are not names they are just what they do
because I can&#39;t remember what everyone
does so this is the Bridgewater hedge
fund guy
I do that I have the artist who white
watches white people out of paintings
guy the robotics dog guy who has no hear
about the military using his robots guy
the AI Japanese woman who ones robots
capacity SAT equivalent in Japan and the
scientist who swam with the fishes and
now makes the tiny robots to make okay
these are my notes okay
the bridgewater is my guy okay so can
you introduce his idea of radical
openness and that when we have these
meetings at work we should be evaluating
people honestly right after the meeting
okay
to me this is such a crazy idea this is
such a horrendously terrible idea that I
couldn&#39;t I thought it was a bit I really
didn&#39;t think okay but maybe I&#39;m right
okay so and then the 22 year old girl
who works for him who criticized him he
did not explain if she was still working
at the company anymore
and I started thinking oh my god I would
pick it would take me two hours after
every meeting just to evaluate everyone
and I would be thinking about all the
time and then I changed my mind about
people like I think their ideas bad and
then ten minutes later I think maybe was
good or this quality of theirs is
annoying but really maybe it&#39;s not so
bad how can you even do that so then I
looked up Bridgewater and on Wikipedia
cuz I&#39;ve had to do a little research and
there was a disambiguation and it&#39;s
saying do you mean Bridgewater the hedge
fund or do you mean
Bridgewater the the hospital for the
criminally insane and
[Applause]
and it&#39;s out what if he escaped from the
criminally insane starting his hedge
fund and him coming to Ted and giving us
this insane idea of radical openness to
put the seeds of chaos into his
competitors who are my parents but in
honor of him I am going to be radically
open in my notes so there&#39;s something
you might not like people okay Serena
Williams oh my god she&#39;s so incredible I
just wrote it Gayle caches I didn&#39;t know
I love Serena Williams I loved how she
talked about her sister and how they
like how they compete and I love that so
much and then even though it was a
little awkward I thought when Gayle
asked her about her body being masculine
or whatever but you know of course
Serena just handles it all she&#39;s so
fantastic and I love that she said that
she used to not like her body or feel
you know she didn&#39;t think didn&#39;t like it
but then she realized that her body was
allowing her to achieve the goals that
she wanted to achieve and then she began
to love her body and I really I went
through the same trajectory I you
something that I don&#39;t like my body then
I realize my body is here to make people
laugh okay okay now here I&#39;m okay so the
rabbi okay so the rabbi talked about
getting all verklempt about we the
people which I agree that is really
emotional than we the people even you
know in our Constitution or you know the
founding of our nation we the people and
it is really emotional and I was
thinking except it&#39;s so hard not to have
these little things in your head Rico
well except when they wrote that when
they said we the people they really
didn&#39;t mean african-americans or women
or Native Americans but you know okay we
amended that and now we&#39;ve amended it
further because now we the people
includes corporations and so yeah that&#39;s
different than it used to be and then he
talked about how in his religious
tradition the Passover is telling the
story of their people of the people with
so much by the way nothing is better
than a story with food I mean to me that
is the great
greatest thing and the Catholics I was
raised Catholic we only have a little
dinner theater at our head and arm
things with the body and blood of Christ
but the Passover is fantastic I mean you
need to have a story and haven&#39;t relate
to all the food and his idea was that
you know the Passover kind of reinforced
this idea of a people history and then
that not only let the people know what
their history was it allowed them to be
more open to other cultures and other
people&#39;s stories which I don&#39;t know if
that&#39;s really true in every place of the
world about okay but I love that I
really do love that idea but then I
thought okay we kind of do that what
Thanksgiving but that story and to me
the story being actually true it&#39;s
really important because that&#39;s
something we didn&#39;t really get into like
the the woman who talks about meaning
who was raised by the suzie&#39;s she talked
about how important story was to meaning
in our lives but I felt like she needed
to talk more about if the story was true
or not being an important element of the
story in fact at the end of her talk I
practically expect you to say and that&#39;s
why I&#39;m a Scientologist because I felt
like we needed to know if the story is
true okay so that&#39;s my efficient you
know agenda but what if we inspired by
this rabbi talking about Passover
created a new dinner that everyone in
the world participated in but what does
my not funny chunk so don&#39;t worry about
that I really mean this I think we can
have a big dinner where there&#39;s things
at the dinner that represent our real
true history of humans and I just want
you to come up with ideas and tell me
about them because I really think if we
did this like it&#39;s a whole world had a
day where we had a meal and remembered
our history now it would start out being
paleo of course and I think that we&#39;d
have to leave a chair not for Elijah but
for for the the Neanderthal we&#39;d have to
leave a chair for the Neanderthal like
every 14th chair would have to do the
Neanderthal and then we can have like a
little chicken and that would be like
when we domesticated animals and maybe
we&#39;d have a little milk in the milk
would have a little bottleneck and that
would be when there was the population
bottleneck and we almost went extinct
that than we didn&#39;t
come on people all right okay all right
okay now here&#39;s my next trick ski
material and then I&#39;ll just go back to
normal stuff okay I love the Pope oh my
god I&#39;m such a huge fan of this Pope and
I was raised Catholic and enjoyed it and
then became an atheist which I also
enjoy and and I was really excited to
see the Pope and I loved that he would
st. ed in Italian did that was my I was
like his face had an Italian was so
fantastic
um and I love that he chose where he was
it really just seemed like probably the
health care office at the Vatican like
he said have been he could have been in
a gold gilt room with a chair and you
know like I personally thought he should
be suspended in the air over the Sistine
Chapel like right in between God and
Adam and the stark but you know I come
from theater so that&#39;s my idea but um my
personal see with the fogers I I think
that&#39;s an atheist that&#39;s right
I do now okay maybe that&#39;s wishful
thinking on my part but I feel like I&#39;m
a pretty good Adar and I felt like he
gave a little smile at man and it wasn&#39;t
being it was like we knew okay
I mean yeah so he came out resilient
said that atheists are better than bad
Christians which I agree with
okay let&#39;s move on all right
okay now all the risky materials yeah I
did everything okay now which one should
I do know the Ted okay so when they did
the ted-ed for kids
I actually got kind of upset because I
was thinking oh my god Ted is just
eating itself alive with its own success
like does it really do they really have
them dead and for kids they&#39;re gonna
have like dead infant soon where you&#39;re
just born and you have to watch the TED
talk as soon as you&#39;re born
and it&#39;s just too much head I just felt
like I thought getting so successful
that I don&#39;t even know if I could be
part of it anymore because I was too
successful okay so but then right after
that the girl came up playing the guitar
the girl from Minnesota always a guitar
playing girl with a story from Minnesota
and she was so great I mean to me that
was one of the most incredible
performances I&#39;ve ever seen okay I love
her so much and then later the
electronic guy came with all his
instruments and at the beginning of it I
thought oh my god romance okay these two
are going to get together this is going
to be so cute that they met it head and
then he went on a little longer and then
I thought okay I hope she can teach him
a couple of things
look out coming down and just having a
melody and longer and I thought she
can&#39;t go out with him her melody will be
drowned out by an instrument and I was
thinking I was mad at his parents for
building that room I was like he needs
to meet other people meet other people
okay I now seeing that everything I say
is great all right
I just reading my notes the Alzheimer&#39;s
woman who wrote still life I can&#39;t
remember anything she said
um Gary Kasparov the chess guy I thought
he would be talking more about Putin I
know he has a new book out winter is
coming he&#39;s a big by the way that makes
me think I actually do wonder this does
the nuclear winter help with global
warming I don&#39;t know okay so he had this
book I thought it&#39;d be more about Putin
but it wasn&#39;t but I really loved that
guy and by the way has anyone seen Gary
Kasparov lately okay all right I the
grass lady daughter-in-law of the great
bubble grab guy who just died first of
all how does she become the
daughter-in-law I think that&#39;s a big
part of his story we didn&#39;t get I loved
her grass that&#39;s the one where she
showed how people have toilets who are
poor like it&#39;s basically poor people
have more in common with each other and
rich people have more in common with
each other in the world than nationality
and everything else and I thought it was
incredible taking pictures of the
toothpaste and the toothbrushes but I
kept thinking if Trump were on that
continuum and there was a picture of his
gold-plated toilets the world would see
that he has more in common with the
Sultan of Brunei than he does with
anyone else all right okay here&#39;s a list
of things I learned this week people use
their cell phone to watch AI people who
come up with their automatic dogs and so
forth never talk about the military
applications in their speech I&#39;ve
learned that old people are vital well
not that vital
I&#39;ve learned that I&#39;m not slothful when
I&#39;m laying around I&#39;m just in default
mode
I learned that robots can take care of
aging parents and I say yes go I don&#39;t
care if it&#39;s unstable it&#39;s just beta
test it with the real population in my
case I&#39;m ready to go I&#39;ve learned that
all living things must die except pond
scum okay when this I&#39;ve learned if you
are in incredible physical shape Ironman
shape you can strap some small jet
engines on your body and it will live
you three or maybe even four feet off
the ground it will be very noisy and
there will be just you old flames and
smell everywhere but it is possible and
I&#39;m thinking that in LA maybe both
jesting things could solve the
helicopter noise problem there because
it will just drown out any of them I&#39;ve
learned it before we make an artificial
intelligence AI that can think and feel
we need to kill off all the people who
wouldn&#39;t turn that AI off if asked you
and we know who you are because we&#39;ve
collected those
Hey okay oh yeah but am at the m&#39;s guy
okay the end guy with the grab I didn&#39;t
even know I didn&#39;t know if I miss what
the M was I didn&#39;t
I actually thought is he talking about
millennium yes I&#39;m afraid of Millennials
I mean I could figure out what are you
talking about
then if there was this thing a.m. on the
screen and I was thinking oh I&#39;m already
been trying to avoid M&amp;Ms now I have to
avoid em if auntie em okay then I
thought oh my god this part is so
complicated I have to make a copy of
myself that can hear this talk and when
the copy comes back to tell myself what
the stuff was about I have to kill it
oh my god Oh sir park xrr our space
archaeologist who I love so much
I was wondering at her system can help
me find the car keys I lost in the
backyard I was thinking about my work
and also I just want to let you know
that when she took her hat hat off and
threw it into the audience
it actually severely hurt someone in the
audience who will now be the next
villain on the next indiana jones&#39; oh
the Indian Elmo sky so terrible I don&#39;t
know his name
okay I&#39;m Indian text a friend of mine
said he thought his speech should have
been more substantive and more truly
authentic and I would say no I really
thought it was and and then he said well
what did you really think this speech
was about and I said well I was just
watching a siege and I thought it seems
so great and then I just was noticing
his hair his incredible hair and his
beautiful skin and his Melissa Lewis
voice and when I came to again he was
just saying love he was great
oh oh thank you because I&#39;ve rated that
Mitel the mores were going to be
shortened so much being on this stage
but now that you&#39;re laughing I feel like
I&#39;m hitting strength alright um okay I&#39;m
getting my stopping cue another thing
that I&#39;ve learned thank you very much
okay I&#39;m just looking at all my notes
here Serena was a rabbi the artist who
white watches the people out of the
painting okay I just have riskier
material you&#39;re just meeting me and
horsing there was a thing at the Supreme
Court and he went and whitewashed out
all the white people we&#39;re left it
wouldn&#39;t be as satisfying okay the Pope
oh my god everyone saw the Pope material
on okay everybody did the air cleaner
guy oh I choked the category of my
husband ruins everything every so I
would hear a talk and I would get so
excited and think something&#39;s been great
and solved and then I would turn to my
husband and then he would just be like
now okay
that&#39;s his role with me so like the air
cleaner guy who made the air cleaners
that he put in the part in China that
cleaned the air of the park oh my god oh
my god he needs to build so many of
those and they&#39;re all over the place so
I turn around and said he&#39;s like we
don&#39;t know how much carbon it takes to
meet those we don&#39;t know how much carbon
it takes to run them and and I was like
okay fine but I want one of those rings
I really want a smog range okay then the
chalk dust guy to chuck like solving it
with the truck this you know to me done
fine sounds good let&#39;s just put a bunch
of stock up there it&#39;s so true we&#39;re
putting a lot of other up in the
air why not put some chalk
welcome warming folk and he said what
really cool the earth are we or will we
just feel colder because we&#39;ll all be
sneezing all the time but architect
comes up i love the mud architect and as
like we&#39;re thinking about remodeling our
house in LA and I&#39;m like nice wait I&#39;ve
stolen with fun we&#39;re going to make up a
lot of house in LA and he&#39;s like that&#39;s
never going to get the city would never
allow that so that he could then Elvis a
Huey guy where he just put UV in all the
hospital rooms and everywhere to kill
all the superbugs which I thought they
could put a lot of blacklight posters in
those hospital around how they cool and
then of course Michael says we just
learned that there&#39;s good bacteria
everywhere too and that would just kill
everything so I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll work
oh but because of the Irish poet last
night which made me cry almost the
entire time I now realize that I&#39;ve
specifically chosen him to break my
heart so that&#39;s a weight off my
shoulders thank you so much um okay a
lot of things I&#39;ve learned till the
mohrís or shortening their shortening
right now shortening shortening
shortening oh I love the blue-haired
algorithm lady and the pink haired City
design gain lady those are two looks
that are hard to pull up and they both
look so fantastic I want to get back
okay that&#39;s it I&#39;m really stopping I&#39;m
going to be drinking a lot at the party
and I&#39;m really excited that I got to
come this year because truly it is it is
such a pleasure to be able to be amongst
all these bright minds and thank you
thank you thank you
[Applause]
