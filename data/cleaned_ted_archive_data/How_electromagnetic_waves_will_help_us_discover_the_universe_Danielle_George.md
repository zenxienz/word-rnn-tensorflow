in 1831 Michael Faraday demonstrated
right here in this very lecture theatre
electromagnetic induction and that
started a quest for us to understand and
exploit a unique entity and a one that
we use every day every minute really but
you can&#39;t see it or touch it or smell it
it&#39;s almost magical electromagnetism and
electromagnetism touches every part of
our life just take one data point the
mobile phone there are now more mobile
phones than people in the world 7.2
billion mobile phones and that number
will already be obsolete and whilst many
of us carry a cell phone around with us
wireless technology this information
from electromagnetic radiation touches
so many parts of everyday life TV and
radio communication systems for police
and firefighters to taxi services and so
much more there is no doubt that
wireless technology is a defining
feature in modern day life and a crucial
part of our social infrastructure and
yet I&#39;d like to argue that we&#39;ve only
just begun to scratch the surface of
what we can achieve by tapping in
harnessing and exploiting electro
magnetism and I&#39;d like to show a few
examples here tonight of what&#39;s to come
with this technology but first I&#39;d like
to take a minute just to explain how
this seemingly magic entity seems to
work because whilst we all use
electromagnetic radiation few of us
actually know how it works but we
encounter portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum every day
in so many ways and here you can see the
electromagnetic spectrum and so you can
see things that you&#39;re familiar with
radio waves microwaves ultraviolet
infrared visible light these are all
things that make up the electromagnetic
spectrum whether you&#39;re sitting at home
walking down the street on a bus in a
taxi or here tonight you&#39;re bathing in a
sea of electromagnetic waves these
streams of particles of mass no mass
photons patterns of electricity and
magnetism that zip zap through space at
the speed of light invisibly sorry one
second I&#39;ve lost my train of thought I
apologize
now we live and move through this
invisible broth of energy every day and
since Faraday we have learned how to
transmit data using air as the vehicle
and tonight I want to show different
examples of how we&#39;re doing that so
let&#39;s take our first example I want to
show how we can change our life using
wireless technology and how it&#39;s shaping
our life in so many different ways the
way we form the way we fly the way we
design cities and so much more for
example 2.8 billion people in the world
are still affected by water scarcity and
that number is only going to increase as
the need to feed a growing population
also increases and many people are using
different ways of trying to use wireless
technology and subsoil sensing
technology to measure and monitor soil
parameters such as soil temperature the
moisture and nutritional information
needed for crop growth and the
information you see here the project you
see here uses passive RFID technology or
radio frequency identification
technology and subsoil sensing
technology and it&#39;s trying to integrate
the two things so what you see here are
sensor nodes buried in the soil and they
transmit data wirelessly to an RFID
reader on the tractor now these sensor
nodes don&#39;t contain batteries so they&#39;re
capable of harvesting the energy from
the electromagnetic spectrum generated
by the RFID reader on the tractor so the
way it works is we have sensor nodes in
the
soil and they transmit that data through
the soil wirelessly to the RFID reader
on the tractor and that allows the
farmer to determine what action to take
depending on the results that they&#39;re
getting so when you combine that with
GPS information or satellite information
to tell the farmer exactly where the
tractor is in that field the farmer is
then able to make a decision on whether
or not to irrigate that part of the
field all in real time so we are moving
towards precision agriculture by using
wireless technology or consider jet
planes now aeroplanes are mission
critical vehicles and we want them to be
safe and reliable and efficient so
during development engines are
instrumented with hundreds sometimes
even thousands of sensors and currently
these sensors are hard wired to a data
acquisition unit and because they&#39;re
hardwired they are sometimes very
expensive they&#39;re time-consuming to put
together and they&#39;re quite inflexible
but they&#39;re also susceptible to cable
and connector issues so wireless sensor
networks have been proposed as a
possible solution to this problem for
many of the sensors so let&#39;s imagine a
wireless sensor network set up inside an
engine and that wireless sensor network
is taking data of that engine so things
like temperature pressure force
acceleration and adding an ode to that
engine and to that network is quick and
simple that means we can build up more
data about that engine and the more data
we have the more knowledge we can build
up of that engine and the more knowledge
we have the more likely we are to
able to design much more reliable
efficient engines so we&#39;re using
wireless technology to help us create
much more reliable efficient engines
thus reducing carbon emissions in the
world as a third example let&#39;s think
about the built environment using
wireless technology to map the building
the inside of a building for the
visually impaired now in response to the
need to give visually impaired people
equal access to public buildings the use
of Braille became a legal requirement in
many countries in the UK Braille signs
are affixed to public buildings in many
different ways so you will see Braille
signs in affixed to toilet signs to lift
panels and the top and bottom of flights
of stairs in many public buildings such
as offices museums and university
buildings like my university building
here which is where we piloted the
scheme but for a visually impaired
person there is an inherent challenge
here and that is to actually physically
locate the sign in order to read the
Braille by touch now it&#39;s a real
challenge and it&#39;s one that leaves a
visually impaired person naturally
frustrated so we&#39;re trying to use
wireless technology to help the visually
impaired navigate safely through
buildings so how we do it is we have
passive RFID tags radio frequency
identification tags and they are
embedded into the Braille signs then the
visually impaired user of the building
would be given an RFID reader and that
reader could be integrated into their
smartphone and it would be capable of
interrogating those tags wirelessly and
retrieving all of the information
that person would need in order to
navigate through the building safely so
we&#39;re using wireless technology to help
the visually impaired by producing smart
navigational tools for my final example
let&#39;s think about big scale instruments
that use radio waves from the
electromagnetic spectrum now we&#39;ve been
able to broadcast radio signals into
deep space and receive signals from deep
space for over a century now and that is
allowed us to realize how much of the
universe there is beyond what we think
we know so larger and more powerful
astronomical instruments have been
designed in the past decades to look
deeper and deeper into space now I&#39;m
very fortunate to have been part of a
large-scale project a big international
team looking at building the next
generation instrument the largest and
most powerful astronomical telescope in
the world ever it&#39;s called the SKA or
the Square Kilometre Array now the
Square Kilometre Array will be made up
of hundreds of thousands of radio
antennas and you can see an artist&#39;s
rendering here about how it may actually
look like and all of these antennas will
be connected and they&#39;ll be spread
across thousands of kilometers but
they&#39;ll have a central core in Western
Australia and in a remote area of South
Africa and the size of the SKA will make
it 50 times more sensitive than any
other radio instrument and that will
allow us not only to extend our
knowledge of the observable universe but
also to ask and answer key questions in
astrophysics cosmology and fundamental
physics
in fact the SKA will be so sensitive
that it will be able to detect an
airport radar system on a planet 10
light-years away and the amount of data
it will produce is enormous the dishes
of the SKA will produce ten times the
global internet traffic almost two
centuries ago michael faraday stood in
this very lecture theatre and captured
his notes in this very notebook his
ideas on electro magnetism and I&#39;m very
very honored to be standing next to this
and that kicked off a quest for us to
understand harness and exploit
electromagnetism and we&#39;ve done quite
well so far but guess what we&#39;re still
just at the beginning thank you
increases
