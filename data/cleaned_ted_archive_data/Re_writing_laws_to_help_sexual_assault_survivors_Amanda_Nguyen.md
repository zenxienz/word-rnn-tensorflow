next week I will stand in the United
States Capitol alongside senators and
introduce the civil rights bill that I
wrote did you know that you can write a
bill and get it introduced in Congress
there are a lot of steps and today I&#39;ll
show you mine the bill is a sexual
assault survivor Bill of Rights and it
was born from my experience with a
broken criminal justice system I am a
rape survivor and I remember walking
into the waiting room it was my local
area rape crisis center and seeing so
many people there but the greatest
injustice that I&#39;ve ever faced was not
the act of rape itself but rather the
subsequent denial of my rights by the
country that I alive you see in America
I thought we were born equal under the
law and yet as a survivor I discovered
that this isn&#39;t the case survivors are
often revitalized by the very system
that was built and to seek and protect
justice one of the first things that
happens after a rape is a three to seven
hour long examination it&#39;s called a rape
kit for short and it&#39;s critical evidence
collection it takes this long because
the crime scene is your body in
Massachusetts there is a six-month
deadline for survivors to report the
crime before that kit can be destroyed
even if the statute of limitations to
report the crime in Massachusetts is 15
years that means every six months the
survivor needs to fight to hold on to
this evidence from the trash can and in
California Colorado Illinois and Texas
they don&#39;t destroy kits these huge
irregularities means that justice
depends on geography and in building a
legal argument
why I deserve to know we&#39;re DNA samples
taken from my body are I found a
patchwork of Rights across America over
40 states have backlogs and untested
kits a handful of states including
Massachusetts don&#39;t notify the survivor
when they permanently dispose of a kit
no state has comprehensive civil rights
for survivors justice cannot depend on
geography my story is not mine alone
the CDC estimates that there are 25 to
30 million survivors in the United
States that&#39;s equivalent to the entire
population of Texas and these millions
are navigating illegal labyrinths it&#39;s
through data-driven comparative analysis
of state laws and policies as well as
meeting with these survivors that I
understood there&#39;s a huge but fixable
problem my vision is simple fix the
patchwork of Rights take the rights that
already work in states that are least
controversial and put them together so
that we are equal under the law these
rights are so basic rights like don&#39;t
destroy the evidence before the statute
of limitation runs out or notify
survivors what their rights are so they
have resources or create a task force
with key stakeholders so that everyone
can assess the effectiveness of these
policies look these rights can even help
the accused it&#39;s just a bad idea to
throw away evidence DNA evidence often
exonerates they accused these rights
will result in the actual identification
of real perpetrators the testing of
2,000 of 11,000 untested rape kits in
Detroit Michigan resulted in the
identification of a hundred serial
rapists and ten convicted rapists I had
a choice accept injustice
or rewrite the law and one of these
things is a lot better than the other so
I along with an incredible team wrote
this bill it actually started from one
mass email I emailed everyone I knew
and people wrote back we&#39;re coders
students activists Millennials
healthcare professionals and together we
volunteered our time to research and
come up with a common-sense solution
then came the hard part
convincing politicians to care and more
times than I can count people told me my
constituents just don&#39;t know me for this
or I have a reelection anywhere about
but we went door-to-door in state houses
and in the US Congress we literally just
googled staff emails and then met with
anyone who would care to listen to our
fight and that&#39;s how we found our
champions in two months we introduced
the bill in Massachusetts in four months
other states asked us for the bill and
in five months we found ourselves in the
halls of the United States Congress but
this process hasn&#39;t been abstract for me
the very month my first federal
legislation was introduced I found out
that against an extension put into place
Mike it was removed wrongly from the
forensic lab and almost destroyed so if
the process of change feels tiring and
sucky trust me I feel you but with this
bill we have a path forward we have a
real chance of making enormous change
for millions of people I want to leave
you with three things today the first is
the issue that you understand how broken
the criminal justice system is for
survivors the second is the solution
that with this bill we have a path
forward and the third is the realization
that the voices of ordinary citizens can
still change the world to be honest with
you it&#39;s really scary for me to be on
the stage right now and share with you
something so personal but I am doing it
because I want you to see the
value in these civil rights and I&#39;m
hoping that you also see you have agency
over what happens in your own States and
in your own towns you see the most
powerful tool that we have is our voice
and that is why I am using mine today to
fight for these rights and that is why I
encourage you to fight for whatever it
is you dream about because it is
possible to change the nation and the
world all it takes is one voice thank
you
[Applause]
