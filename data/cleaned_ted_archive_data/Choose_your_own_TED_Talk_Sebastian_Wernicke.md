Thanks there is one end of the spectrum
that we haven&#39;t yet explored actually
it&#39;s one thing that has remained the
same for every single TED talk that I
know of and that is you have had no
influence over what happens on this
stage so I thought that this year for
full-spectrum we should change that and
that is why you all have those red and
green cards because at various points
during this talk I will offer you a
decision of what is going to happen next
in this talk and I want you to use your
cards to vote on that and to determine
which pass this talk will take and which
parts of this talk no one will ever get
to see so whenever you&#39;re up for making
a decision it&#39;s going to look like this
so first for practice are you already
here I do see a lot of green which is
great of course it also means that you
will never know what would have happened
if you had said no so one more thing
apparently Ted figured that if you get
two choices all the time I only get half
the time so you will really have to be
lightning-fast with your votes here no
matter what happens so for example if I
ask you to accept the license agreement
of this talk you will immediately thank
you green that&#39;s good of course you
wouldn&#39;t have had a real choice here
anyway because it&#39;s a license agreement
and you never really have any real
choice with license agreements but now
the concept of adding choice to
something to a story something that is
essentially linear many of you might be
reminded of these books here this is a
truce your own adventure book which I
guess many of you still know from the
childhood and yes and at various points
they offered you a decision of what you
would do next and depending on what you
would do next the story would continue
in very different ways and actually the
invention of those books is quite
interesting because well first of all it
took a few hundred years until somebody
actually came up with the idea which I
found is rather strange and then
secondly when this man here Edward
Packard invented those books it was more
or less by accident and I would like to
tell you that story
I just need some guidance on the
perspective here so oh that&#39;s a that&#39;s a
bit more green I think so in the late
1960s Caroline and Andrea Packard they
were living in New York and each night
when their father would come home he
would make up bedtime stories for them
and all of those bedtime stories they
had a common theme they were about a guy
named Pete and he was living on this
vast dangerous island in the middle of
the ocean and each night he would have a
different adventure on that island until
one fateful night where well actually
Pete had kind of run out of things to do
on that island so he didn&#39;t really know
what to do and that night was when
Caroline and Andrea were asked a
question that I think they had secretly
been waiting for a long time because
their father father simply asked them so
what do you think Peters going to do now
and they were very enthusiastic about it
but also they were in complete
disagreement so much in disagreement
that in fact they forced their father
this night tell them to different
bedtime stories with very different
endings and that is how those books were
actually born and they became very very
successful but what I find surprising is
just how successful they became so are
we gonna go with the facts here I think
okay nobody okay so so emotion it&#39;s got
its green
I heard complaints
[Laughter]
some parts no one will ever get to see
so so all kids love those books and
Edward Packard got a bunch of letters
and I think this letter is very telling
from a little girl in Vermont who wrote
to Edward Packard saying I got lots of
Spears in my back I went down a
quicksand and that was so great so kids
just love dying in those books for some
parent reason and it also allowed Edward
Packard to follow his true passion
because actually figured he didn&#39;t
really like law that very much and
allowed him to become a full-time writer
which he still is today
but in spite of all of this success the
format of choose-your-own-adventure
never really caught on
beyond children&#39;s and teenager adventure
books there&#39;s there&#39;s one book in French
literature and actually has some very
odd adult entertainment novels but other
than that um never caught on and it
never caught on to Ted which I find
strange because it&#39;s an teen ingenious
combination of entertainment and design
plus if you add if you take this concept
to a TED talk you also have technology
in the mix which is great because
basically anything can be finely tuned
to your taste right down to the color of
the slides so what&#39;s it going to be we
have a lot of Jade fans in here which is
an interesting path in this talk because
actually we could take this even further
and kind of introduce the concept of a
Ted pre talk where we just ask you what
kind of talks you like to hear so for
example do you prefer your TED Talks to
be rather the quiet ones or do you like
the expressive ones which ones
Oh expressive great do you want them to
be idealistic or detailed that&#39;s a tough
one
idealistic and do you like your TED
Talks to be more personal or analytical
personal so without three there&#39;s three
questions we now have your personality
profile here basically so in a basic
myers-briggs kind of way so we&#39;re all
looking forward to 2013 the undiscovered
hype generators now of course we also
have every one of you here on HD video
so we&#39;re gonna figure out your
individual personality profiles as well
later on it&#39;s all covered by the license
agreement so you don&#39;t really have to
have to worry now of course there is a
real danger here and or or threat and
that is if you offer too much choice you
end up with replacing serendipity with
fulfilled expectations and I think it
might even beg the question if there can
be such a thing as choose your own TED
talk because it may be just that choice
and TED talk you&#39;re not coming here
because of choice are not the wrong kind
of choice and interestingly that is also
something that the choose your own
adventure books figured out as time went
by and I would like to visualize this
for you and your preferred way which
would be the trees I deliberately did
not call it bubbles because then because
of Hans Rosling everybody would have
gone with a but um so what you see here
is the decision tree of one of the very
first choose your own adventure books
and you can see it&#39;s a very rich
offering of different story lines and
you can end up at over 40 different
endings and this is how the books looked
seven years later on and you can see
it&#39;s greatly simplified so there is
actually not many diversions from the
main story and one thing that you have
to look hard to to spot out in this
picture there&#39;s actually only one very
good ending to the story so choice it
turns out in stories or books is not
about offering very many different
stories but it&#39;s about play
with a story and enriching that it even
went so far this is one of my favorite
ideas of that playing with the with the
herbs you don&#39;t get to see that one yet
of playing with that ideas and that
isn&#39;t this one book where well the story
is you&#39;re captured by aliens and they
want you to look with them for a planet
of paradise and you&#39;re told in the
beginning of the book that you cannot
reach that planet by making decisions or
following directions and that is
actually what it turns out to be there&#39;s
a chapter right in this book where you
do reach the best possible ending in
this book but you cannot reach it from
any other chapters so Edward Packard
wanted you to deliberately step out of
those mechanics that he imposed on you
and just make your own choices which i
think is also a wonderful lesson because
it shows that with a new format you can
play with the rules and you can play
even with the most fundamental and the
most sacred rules which of course is
also why you don&#39;t get to make that
choice
Palm Springs has already chosen that
we&#39;re going to explore the full spectrum
of PowerPoint presentations here which
is option B and with a slide that I
think will forever stick in your mind
try to convince you that interactive TED
Talks could actually be very fun because
it&#39;s choose-your-own-adventure
plus technology but of course this talk
it can only be an invitation to that so
I think there&#39;s a lot to explore
actually with choose your own TED talk
think about voting on stage
modifications voting on speaker emotions
or simply just turning a talk into a
game for the audience to play but
whether you accept that invitation that
is your choice right now we&#39;re going to
have more very mixed vote of course I&#39;m
going to go with green here so
so at the end of my talk is actually
where we can see the story beginning
thank you very much thanks thanks so
much
Sebastian you know to pull that off must
have been a technical tour de force I
mean how how do you go from a PowerPoint
down to individual slides tree for like
that okay so it&#39;s a special PowerPoint
that allows you to branch in two
different directions so just as with the
books it&#39;s not linear anymore so now you
can use powerpoints and jump to
whichever parts you want I have no key
PowerPoint could do that and if you
don&#39;t program it so thanks a lot
