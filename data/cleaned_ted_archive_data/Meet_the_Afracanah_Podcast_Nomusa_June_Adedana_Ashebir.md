we&#39;re not here to talk about Africa
rising or Africa falling Oran Khafre cos
not a country or about how solar
sanitary pads will save us all because
that&#39;ll definitely be a thing we&#39;re not
here to talk about any of those things
because these are topics that have
already been covered and things that we
and the West should already know by now
but what we up for may be the solar
sanitary pad part true very very true
but what we are here to talk about today
is community and new media so how did we
get started so as you can see on the
screen a really common thing to wake up
in two in the morning four hundred and
three unread whatsapp messages from your
various group chats your DMS here from
Nairobi you&#39;ll definitely know what I&#39;m
talking about and so a common thread
through many of our conversations we&#39;re
very simple and similar about being
diaspora about being Riaz pura in our
case being to ask for twice over but we
didn&#39;t see these themes reflected in
media for example young women across the
continent building great things for
themselves but with little recognition
the collision of higher Western
education with building a career on the
African continent or dating
have you tried tinder in Nairobi anyone
show of hands yeah maybe I bet you went
to Java on that birthday maybe you did
probably or being really competent in
two different worlds but being very
confused about which one you belong to
or having African parents and very very
high expectations and so our girl child
was born and it was called the Africana
podcast the far the men on the far right
and far left of this photo are our
fathers and alongside our very shy
mothers and oral storytelling has always
been a big part of our upbringing
including the very factual tale of
walking in the snow uphill both
ways to school in the Sahara Desert in
the pouring rain with no shoes it&#39;s not
lost on us that we&#39;ve made the exact
opposite journey as our parents but with
shoes and hashtags but now it&#39;s our turn
to share our stories and so yes Africa
is not a country but we are by and large
known for our truth telling sometimes
the truth telling can be a bit too harsh
still and we couldn&#39;t have started a
podcast without being true to ourselves
and to our humor exhibit a comedy
podcasting it&#39;s powerful it&#39;s liberating
and it&#39;s also a great accompaniment to
Nairobi traffic an audio as a medium
allows us to be very honest with
ourselves and with our listeners we
chose audio as a medium because it was
the most accessible for us as
independent producers but it also turned
out to be the most accessible for our
listeners which oddly enough according
to Facebook analytics our Ethiopian men
from the ages of 18 to 24 who knew our
podcast in its truest form is a
conversation amongst friends we recorded
on our phones sitting on our couch while
drinking try audio is a medium is very
intimate and our listeners include us in
a variety of their daily routines
cooking cleaning driving etc and it
breeds familiarity and we pride
ourselves on building a platform that
features young creatives community
builders and catalysts and so far we&#39;ve
interviewed a few most recently one
Erica Hume a TED fellow with a noted
size 5 filmmaker and author and
nonzero-sum believes was a tech
community builder extraordinaire we end
each episode of the Africana podcast
with an Afrikaner proverb of the week
normally it&#39;s kind of a jumble of
repurposed rap lyrics but for today
we&#39;ll try something a little bit
different so here is the proverb for the
Ted audience and it goes like this if
your uber gets into three accidents on
the way to Ted it&#39;s best to use that
time to practice
true story that did happen thank you
thank you very much
