look at these children and you see the
future their country Central African
Republic is in turmoil but their
continent is changing African economies
are growing and Africa&#39;s entrepreneurs
are increasingly successful by 2020
Africa&#39;s consumer market will surpass
China&#39;s by 2050 Africa&#39;s population will
triple and one-third of all the youth on
the planet will be African what are
these people going to do well the key is
education
Africa&#39;s already given the world so much
in music in art and sport Africa gave us
Mandela will there be another will there
be an African in style or will there be
a person or people who embody both the
science of Einstein and the humanity of
Mandela with this in mind we set up the
African Institute for mathematical
sciences in Cape Town South Africa in
2003 the idea was to bring an aspiring
young scientists from across Africa
together with the best lecturers in the
world it&#39;s implicit to yourself itself
put them together and let the sparks fly
Ames has recruited some amazing students
there are now 570 alumni a third of them
women and they come from 35 African
countries each one of them has an
amazing life story and I want to tell
you about two of them this is a picture
of Marcial he&#39;s on the Left he was born
to a single parent in Cameroon who
raised six children by selling
vegetables in the market and amazingly
she managed to send all six to
university Marcial came top
math in the country and he came to Ames
to study well today Marcio is a staff
scientist at Yale and one of the leading
young researchers in neglected tropical
diseases he brings powerful math to bear
to understand the connection between
schistosomiasis for example and HIV
transmission and these papers are being
published in the most prestigious
journals like the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences the second
student is fittest who comes from
Ethiopia from a remote village where the
when she was born the infant mortality
rate was 20% killeth sweats was taken to
Addis Ababa by an aunt in the hope of
finding a better life and she went to
university and then came to Ames while
she was at Ames and you see her a second
from the left she meet she met Stephen
Hawking and helped us launch the next
Einstein initiative right now killest is
a postdoctoral fellow in North Carolina
working on computational science and you
see her on the left at singularity
University which some of you know well
and on the right winning over one of our
newest supporters well when we started
Ames in 2003 we had a dream that Ames
was for Africa that Ames would help
bring Africa into science and we began
with the center in South Africa but when
I won the TED Prize in 2008 I wished for
a network of 15 aim centers all across
Africa and I&#39;m delighted to tell you
today that with Ted&#39;s help that dream is
coming true
we opened aim Senegal in 2011 and here
we are dancing with the Nobel Prize
winner Klaus von klitzy we open names
Ghana in 2012 in another beautiful
seaside location Ames Ames Cameroon
opened last year and had a spectacular
launch two weeks ago in Ames Tanna
Tanzania will open this year later this
year in another fantastic location we&#39;ve
won support from all of these
governments next year we plan to hold
the next Einstein forum it&#39;s a
celebration of Einstein&#39;s discovery of
the equations governing the universe but
even more so it&#39;s about connecting
science to humanity and it will take
it&#39;ll be the Davos of science and it
will take place in Africa I want to talk
a tiny bit about the future we need to
prepare Africa&#39;s young people for the
future and what will the future be
well it&#39;ll be driven by science and it
will involve a transition from today&#39;s
digital age created by the exponential
growth in the number of transistors you
can fit on a chip this will come to an
end when transistors reach the size of
an atom and what&#39;s coming is even more
amazing because we&#39;re beginning to
tackle Nate to deal with nature on our
own terms which are quantum we will have
quantum sensors quantum computers
computers quantum communicators quantum
electronics which will make all of our
gadgets we have today look old-fashioned
and what we have to do is to prepare
Africa&#39;s youth for this future we want
to leapfrog them into the quantum world
so that they can use all their
creativity their inventiveness their
initiative their ideas to access the
treasures from which all of us will
benefit thank you very much
before we go I think there&#39;s one small
surprising head force there&#39;s a small
surprise in fact there two surprises
could you show the next slide this is a
advert please join us for breakfast
tomorrow but I wanted to introduce to
you the real heroes of Ames here is
fittest and Marcia
[Applause]
it&#39;s just so inspiring really an amazing
story to see those photos of you as kids
can you first you Marcio can you give us
sort of a favor tell us a little bit
about the research that you&#39;re working
on now yes currently I&#39;m working on the
interaction between HIV schistosomiasis
and malaria which are three tropical
disease that is really causing havoc all
over the continent and there is a lot of
biological and a lot of epidemiological
interaction between the tree we&#39;re
trying to see how intervening in want
help to reduce the burden on the other
disease or continent and so my research
is fluid dynamics as computational fluid
dynamics so what I do is this model
fluidic fluid using mathematical
equations and I study also interaction
between fluid and other are things like
elastic bodies and things like that
which is used in biology and chemistry
and things like that yeah well in the oh
just briefly I mean how can we
participate if we if we want to be part
of this what&#39;s something we could do I
think Ted has already made a big impact
by raising the profile of Ames and so
far we have raised I I believe modest in
all modesty it&#39;s the most successful Ted
wish ever and that thanks to you
Ames has now raised approaching seventy
million dollars mostly for scholarships
we support all of our students on
scholarships for those of you who can
afford it for $10,000 you can change
somebody&#39;s life by giving them a one
year scholarship at a name Center and I
think Marshall and kid East will tell
you this totally changed their life and
their aspirations I mean to tell you
about these people a little more I mean
Marci our volunteers
to go to Brazil twice per year to teach
in the barrios of the slums in Brazil
because he wants to help kids and kida
stirrers goes back and forth to Ethiopia
and just told me she wants to go back
there and to start a new form of
education that will be more suitable for
young people in Ethiopia than the
traditional kind of factory factory
style schooling which we have all over
the world and particularly in Africa so
these are the ideas which are coming out
of our alumni and I honestly believe
that with with the hundreds and
thousands of alumni who will now come
through Ames we will just change the
terrain of African development
Neil Marci L kiss thank you so much
[Applause]
