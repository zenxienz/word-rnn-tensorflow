I spent the past few years memorizing
the streets and geo-tagging businesses
in Mumbai studying the recruitment
structures for Mexico cities gangs and
trying to define a line between formal
and informal product lines for some of
Colombia&#39;s cartels maybe not exactly
what my parents had in mind for me but I
learned a lot about business along the
way for a lot of people this is what we
think of when I talk about business we
think about modern glass structures
carefully choreographed transactions
interactions hard skills soft skills and
everything in between but for a lot of
people this is what business looks like
this is where the informal economy
thrives in India four out of five jobs
come from the informal economy we see
people working in textile manufacturing
they produce a lot of the clothes that
we wear
they cut tiles for the floors of
bathrooms and for hotel roofs and we see
them working in childcare or baking
selling fish many of the things that are
integral to keeping societies running
for Brazil this number drops to a little
bit below 50% of employment coming from
informal economic activity again we see
them in retail manufacturing private
security an estimated 8 percent of u.s.
GDP comes from informal economic
activity so I suspect this number is a
little bit low for example there are
eleven point seven million undocumented
immigrants living in the United States
we see them picking fruit delivering
takeout taking care of children washing
dishes and so many other activities that
are integral to keeping the United
States economy running when I say that I
study the informal economy most people
assume that I&#39;m talking about black
markets and sometimes I totally am but
the rest of the time I&#39;m also talking
about all these other activities that
are so integral to society that we often
let them go by completely unnoticed why
are they informal sometimes there&#39;s a
massive barrier to entry sometimes it&#39;s
easier to stay off record and sometimes
an idea is too new and too fresh to
really throw it out there and
the formal for a number of reasons some
workers have a really hard time entering
the formal economy the informal economy
presents an attractive alternative their
resources networks and a space to
experiment in some ways the informal
economy is like a real-world incubator
new business owners can try new products
and test them and see how it works
inside of a community existing business
owners can play with rules of business
and see if there are other communities
they might accept them better and
workers can start to carve out a niche
for themselves when the other might
otherwise might not be able to in my
years exploring these ecosystems and
these alternative spaces I&#39;ve learned a
lot about business and I&#39;d like to share
a couple things that I&#39;ve learned from
the informal economy with you today
first your reputation really matters
Pablo Escobar was the was an informal
entrepreneur who at the height of his
career was entering 60 million dollars a
day the Medellin Cartel traffic cocaine
internationally but his particular brand
of business centered a lot on violence
and fear in order to get the job done he
was not afraid of being aggressive and
taking out whoever he needed to to make
sure that his cocaine was going to go
where it needed to go his rival on the
other hand the Cali cartel kept a much
lower profile they were a group of
businessmen they were very focused on
having business plans negotiating having
other alternative product lines that you
could focus on and they stayed away from
violence as much as they could resorting
to it only as a last opportunity for
this reason it was a lot easier for the
Cali cartel to align with the Colombian
and US government&#39;s when they decided to
take out Pablo Escobar on the war on
drugs and it gave them a couple more
years in an extremely lucrative market
lesson two successful informal
businesses are extremely responsive to
the needs of their customers in
particular informal business is very
good at tracking government activity
civil wars and other events that may
affect consumer behavior for example in
Yemen when the foreign currency exchange
bureaus limit access to foreign
currencies and the future of Yemen&#39;s
rael seems a little uncertain foreign
under foreign
currency entrepreneurs will appear in
various parts of the city very
strategically and offer financial
security in the form of American
hundred-dollar bills
and euro 500 bills it&#39;s a lot easier to
carry these around and conceal them than
gold or jewelry might be you can keep
them concealed and on your person at any
time see what I mean lesson 3 community
is an essential part of every business
without massive marketing budgets a lot
of these communities rely on
word-of-mouth they rely on their
customers to give them feedback and help
them improve their products and in the
end essentially your product needs to
speak for itself there&#39;s one Street in
Queens that at night turns into a giant
informal food festival and I love going
it&#39;s full of all these informal Street
carts because it&#39;s sort of a second
shift what happens is it&#39;s really hard
to get a street cart vendor license in
New York City there&#39;s been a wait list
that&#39;s been closed for several years if
you want to have one it costs about
twenty two thousand dollars time one for
two years and on top of that you have to
go through several different departments
of government to get one really
intimidating if you don&#39;t speak English
particularly well what happens instead
is that the people who have formal
street cart licenses will rent some of
their licenses to a second shift so it
goes from a formal shift of workers to
an informal shift of workers and this
becomes a night stream market of sorts
these informal Street Market vendors are
very careful to assure you that despite
their less regulated existence they are
in fact the cleanest best priced and
tastiest option on the street the number
of times I&#39;ve been invited inside of a
street cart to be assured that this is
in fact the cleanest space I will ever
be is wonderful and they&#39;re very
responsive to the needs of their
customers they frequently ask you is
this what you wanted it to be am I
missing something
how can I change this product to be what
you want it to be in economies where
bureaucracies become overly burdensome
regulations really hard to follow and
there are other resources that exist in
your community the informal economy
offers an alternative ecosystem that is
sometimes a lot more fun to plan
the formal economy the entrepreneurs
I&#39;ve spoken to in Mumbai Mexico City and
Queens can tell me where their suppliers
got their products how they&#39;ll start
reinventing them for their product and
how their customers will use them in the
end it&#39;s kind of like talking to an MBA
without all the smoke and mirrors and
fancy language the entrepreneurs I&#39;ve
talked to you are creative resourceful
and so courageous I think in the next
couple years we&#39;ll see a number of
really interesting products and new
business models emerging from the
informal economy all businesses would do
really well to keep watching them
closely thank you
