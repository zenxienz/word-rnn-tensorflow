when I became a teacher of five years
ago my goal was to raise global
awareness I was introduced to the TED
Talks just this past year and found to
make a great tool in the classroom
because the the kids really respond to
them they&#39;re informative entertaining
and frankly they&#39;re short
so I presented I put together a little
presentation that I&#39;d like you to see to
tell the rest of story raising three
boys in Latin America gave my family
exposure to life in the developing world
we gained an appreciation for diverse
cultures and customs and were often
surprised to find that people were
unaware of life beyond their own borders
when we moved to the u.s. in 2000 I
decided to become a teacher to share
some of my cultural experiences as the
world becomes smaller and more
intertwined with the advancement of the
information age today&#39;s youth will
surely come into contact with people
from different backgrounds armed with
knowledge that can be open to these
differences young people in the US are
given a huge range of opportunities
simply for being American if they learn
about social justice and are allowed a
chance to participate and make a
difference we can create a new
generation of globally aware citizens my
goals as a teacher were enhanced when
our school adopted a service-learning
program service-learning consists of
tying curriculum to involvement in real
world applications
research from the national site for
service-learning information shows a
strong relationship between
service-learning and respect for
diversity self-confidence collaborative
skills avoidance of risky behaviors and
resilience after exposure to
service-learning Whitney Burton a
Kingwood highest senior took it upon
herself to raise the funds to build a
school in Sierra Leone Whitney organized
various fundraisers along with a
biobrick campaign her efforts will
provide a school that will include the
building desks books and a teacher
salary for at least a year she surpassed
her goals with the help of other
students who got involved the struggle
of the children who are being forced to
become soldiers in Uganda is another
issue our students have embraced they
have to raise their hands in
surviving can&#39;t stay at home stay at
home they&#39;ll be taken captive and forced
to be soldier I went to a displacement
event where it&#39;s trying to help people
understand what these kids are going
through to be displaced from their homes
so we were displaced so that we can
learn what they go through and feel that
displacement so it just creates more of
a compassion in order to plant the seed
of awareness teachers look for ways to
get students ownership of an idea we
love stories and use of TED Talks in a
classroom has been a great tool to
motivate students in the subjects to
interest them we all enjoy Hans
Rosling&#39;s animated talk on demographics
who shiver has been Saunders treks
across the Arctic ice toward the North
Pole squatter cities become real when
explained by Stuart brand we want to
answer
Bono&#39;s pleas for help in Africa and we
all want to be a part of the making of
iya Wilson&#39;s encyclopedia of life our
students created documentaries and
global issues topics ranged widely from
human trafficking AIDS and child
soldiers as they explored these topics
they became more aware of world problems
tomorrow&#39;s global citizens need exposure
to the events shaping our world and Ted
provides that inspiration exposing more
educators to Ted in the youth of the
tops would provide a great tool to
promote global service-learning thank
you
