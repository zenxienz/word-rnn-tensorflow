good morning we live in an increasingly
turbulent world where we need to adapt
be able to cope and transform to rising
shocks and stresses no where is the
ability to build resilience as good as
among the people living in the harshest
environments in the world the semi-arid
water scarce savannas in the world here
climate is extremely variable droughts
and dry spells being normality your
climate change is hitting hard here I&#39;ve
spent 15 years of doing science on the
ground on building resilience and
improving agriculture among small-scale
farmers this is a happy day in my old
research village summer day rainfall has
come
planting millet on the fringes of the
Nigerian Sahel what I learned during
this long period is the small
innovations can solve grand challenges
just look at this what may be appearing
as an insignificant piece of metal one
of the most innovative technologies to
transform agriculture in the world this
is a McGorry ripper tine it replaces the
plough the mother of Agriculture which
turns the soil but has been proven to be
a very important source of degrading
carbon the largest source of carbon
emissions in the world water scarcity
loss of biodiversity this is copying
nature with minimum disturbance this is
a technology that is similar to the
emerging satellites based computerized
precision farming it&#39;s a knife that
simply opens up the soil with precision
application of water and nutrients
enabling an agricultural revolution for
example in Latin America this is another
innovation from our research in the
highlands of Ethiopia small-scale water
harvesting collecting rainfall to bridge
dry spells and build resilience in the
face of global environmental change this
is by the way where it all began 8,000
years ago this is the cradle of our
civilization this is where we invented
agriculture why because we entered what
we learned in school to call the
Holocene the 10,000 years of
extraordinary environmental stability
since the last deglaciation this is the
Eden&#39;s garden of everything we cherish
the beauty of nature establishes itself
the rainforests the marine systems the
wetlands rainy seasons become
predictable this is the very
precondition for a system like this to
operate this is in fact that the
Holocene is the prerequisite for our
world economy to operate the scientific
message today is as dramatic as it&#39;s
simple the Holocene is the only
stability state of the planet we know
that can support the modern world as we
know it three years back I introduced
and presented the update of science that
we&#39;re hitting the ceiling of the
ecological capacity of planet Earth to
support the modern world as we know it
that we are today at a saturation point
that we have into the new geological era
called the Anthropocene where we anthros
humans are at the driving seat of global
environmental change that we can no
longer exclude major costs for economies
I introduced the scientific concept of
planetary boundaries which provides a
safe operating space here defined in
green where we become stewards of the
environmental processes that are
prerequisite for the earth system to
stay in Holocene like conditions today
I&#39;ll try to convince you of two things
one is that already today we&#39;re starting
to see the impacts and costs for the
economies of our current situation but
the second is the more exciting the
grand idea of the opportunity to
transition into a new development
paradigm of growth and development
within the life-support systems on earth
but I must convince as well but our
journey of risk has only begun we&#39;ve
only reached the aperitif in terms of
risks in the world because we have two
giants in the room the first giant is
the social momentum which is just now
starting we&#39;re rapidly moving towards a
world with four or five six billion
people with a right to development and
lifestyles equivalent to an average
European this is a positive momentum
starting now the second giant in the
room is that so far Mother Earth has
been very forgiving the Earth&#39;s system
has been applying its biogeochemical
systems its resilience to dampen and
protect us she has been incredibly
forgiving by allowing us
to have environmental impacts absorb
without any cost our economy the biggest
subsidy of all to our lifestyles it&#39;s
only in the last 20 years we started to
see evidence that the Earth&#39;s system is
trying to send invoices back into the
economy these are truly two Giants
colliding and they&#39;re colliding right at
this moment in time and this is why it
requires us to think do we need a deep
mind shift in order to secure prosperity
for a world that is moving towards 9
billion people we must recognize that
we&#39;ve moved very quickly from a small
world on a big planet to today a big
world on a small planet but you know
before even the tremors fell from these
giant stepping and dancing on the earth
system we see the implications on the
economy already today at 0.8 degrees
warming so far we see a freak hurricane
veering right in over New York probably
pushed down because of the collapse of
the Arctic Jetstream pushing down cold
air flooding Manhattan to tremendous
cost symbolically putting the New York
Stock Exchange and Wall Street
underwater showing that there is a
financial ecological big scale costs
already today forest fires in Russia
combined with 12 years of drought in
Australia hitting the volatility of food
price markets in the world feeding back
right into the Arab Spring contributing
to trigger that whole social
transformation to scale the first
example of a regional scale political
social ecological abrupt change
occurring at the same time a triple
whammy
indeed deforestation occurring at a very
large scale to the detriment of local
communities in biodiversity now you&#39;ll
think I&#39;ve snatched this from the Lord
of the Rings you&#39;re just waiting for for
the orcs to run across this mortal
landscape but no this is a recent
photography from my friend and colleague
Mattias Klum from National Geographic
this is from Borneo this is 75% loss of
rainforest for palm oil plantations
we&#39;re learning that this is affecting
regional rainfall this is affecting air
pollution it&#39;s affecting
economies with feedbacks back into the
global market it is every finance
ministers concern of keeping biomes in a
stable state in a globalized world this
is a new situation we need to consider
global tipping points that we are
pushing ourselves to a point where
things can abruptly change and push
ourselves out of kicking ourselves out
of the Holocene Eden&#39;s garden just to
give you one example 2012 is potentially
a scientific and Earthwise watershed
Greenland a permanent Ice Sheet a white
permanent surface that reflects back 90%
of incoming heat to space in fact we
know now that the polar regions are
massive planetary coolers these are
actually prerequisite for the Holocene
stability now in 2012 during two weeks
in July the entire Greenland ice sheet
is melting for the first time in
observed history now can you imagine
just the color shift from a white
reflective surface reflecting back 90%
of heat to a slightly darker liquid
surface corresponds to roughly 300
exhales of new heat into the atmosphere
that&#39;s more than the annual consumption
of energy in the United States
Denmark bypasses China and the US as the
largest climate forcing nation on earth
momentarily this is when planet Earth
kicks in her feedbacks this is when she
goes from being a friend to being a foe
this is why we can say profoundly from
science we have empirical evidence that
there is no reason for inaction this is
the time we need to start acting so what
shall we do well to begin with is rising
and very very exciting new thinking
around a new development paradigm moving
away from the belief that we can live on
growth without any limits towards a new
paradigm of growth within the
life-support system on earth
reconnecting our economies to the
biosphere reconnecting our societies to
the living systems on earth as the basis
for our own
paraty you might think that this is a
romantic view but it&#39;s not and in fact
it&#39;s not about protecting nature it&#39;s
about protecting our own prosperity when
Angela guria the OECD secretary-general
in a dialogue that had with him just a
month back says that humanity is on
collision course with nature he says so
not to protect nature but to protect
jobs and prosperity in the future when
ban ki-moon the United Nations General
Secretary launched his report resilient
people resilient planet just a year back
for the United Nations Earth Summit the
Rio +20 the equivalent of the Brundtland
Commission on sustainable development
written by heads of state in the world
the conclusion is our current
development paradigm has come to the end
of the road they&#39;re listening to science
and saying that tipping points can no
longer be excluded we now need a new
idea a new grand thinking into a new
future when the heads of IMF and the
World Bank are supposed to talk about
jobs and economic growth at the World
Economic Forum they say that climate
change and global sustainability is now
a prerequisite for our own prosperity
these are new ideas which means we need
to retire this old notion of the three
separate pillars of sustainable
development environment society and the
economy we must simply admit that this
has become a Mickey Mouse economy where
economic growth has occurred at the
expense of the environment and society
we must not transform our conceptual
thinking into an economy that serves
society that operates within the
life-support systems on earth and recent
science suggests that this can be done
we have recently contributed leading
scientists in the world a new framework
of growth within Earth System limits for
the very important process of trying to
transform the Millennium Development
Goals as you may be aware in 2000 the
world&#39;s nations underwrote the
commitment to have hunger and poverty in
the world now these are to be
transformed sustainable development
goals of new framework unifying
University all nations in the world
towards sustainable development we
propose that this could be the way to do
it
here you see six goals that matter for
own prosperity from an energy transition
to a low-carbon economy to safe
sustainable food production ecosystems
livelihoods governance water security
and for each of these having
science-based definition of goals at the
planetary scale for example a basically
fossil fuel free future for energy
setting social goals like eradicating
poverty and securing the right to
development for all people on earth and
then designing the economy once we have
rebooted our minds to serve these goals
we know we need a global price on carbon
we know that we need a transition to a
circular economy which the European
Union for example is now looking at
instead of selling things to transform
all natural resources energy fluxes and
nutrients in circular processes selling
services instead of products we know
that we can take away the six hundred
billion u.s. dollars a year of subsidies
locking us in our dangerous fossil fuel
energy dependent future so a paradigm
like this can in fact make a difference
and it&#39;s a large change moving from a
growth without limits to a growth within
limits type of paradigm and the beauty
is it&#39;s not about limits to growth it&#39;s
not about you know basically you think
that the only choices we have is either
to essentially say that the party is
over there&#39;s no room for more
development in the world or it is about
contracting and converging everyone
suffers or it&#39;s about putting the heads
in sand which is love for your policies
doing today we think this could be a
fourth way a transition to a safe future
within safe operating space your
question now is of course can this be
done the solutions are there just look
at this for the energy transition in the
world until ten years back you could
argue that solar and wind were small
things a few percent of the energy mix
look at this data from Christian Azhar
from the Solomons University showing
that solar and wind up coming to scale
penetrating more than 10% of markets in
the world really coming to scale
ecosystems serving the economy at big
scale this is the classic catskill
catchment example where sustainable
management of forests is
courting Freshwater&#39;s applied to New
York saving millions of dollars in a
system where we work with nature not
against nature we need to produce fifty
percent more food in the world we need a
new green revolution how can this be
done without destroying biodiversity
nutrients climate and land our culture&#39;s
the largest source of biodiversity loss
and climate change we think there are
innovations for tripley Green Revolution
in water harvesting recirculating
nutrients through productive sanitation
taking our excreta back into our culture
and by bundling plowing this can feed
the world science show that we can feed
the world nine billion people through
sustainable agriculture science is now
mobilizing stepping up to the challenge
future Earth is the largest show in town
in Earth System research for global
sustainability acting on our own
evidence a positive step towards
solutions urbanization in the world is
the largest dynamics we have we have
solutions for ecosystem based
sustainable urban planning and remember
that 60% of the cities in the world had
not even been built yet crisis can be
the source of major transformation
towards positive development the largest
marine system in the world is the Great
Barrier Reef in Australia subject to
tremendous crisis of climate change
pollution from agriculture and
overfishing this system was in a crisis
10-15 years back now governance has been
transformed into new sustainable
strategy where large tracts 30% of the
area is actually protected as major
major large no catch areas building
resilience and putting the Great Barrier
Reef in a new trajectory of
sustainability and resilience in the
face of growing change so my message to
you today is that yes we have major
challenges we&#39;re hitting the ceiling we
cannot exclude catastrophic tipping
points but we have the knowledge and we
have the technology to navigate a good
Anthropocene within a safe operating
space it will require a deep mind shift
it will require us to reconnect our
societies to planet Earth it will
require us to D connect our societies to
the biosphere it is in truth about
rebooting our mental hard drives it&#39;s
about 200 countries becoming planetary
stewards
of an harmonious transformation towards
a new development paradigm of growth and
prosperity within Earth&#39;s limits this is
our human quest it&#39;s in fact about
intertwining the world with planet Earth
in social ecological harmony these were
actually prepared by my 12 year old
daughter Vera and she told me you know
that I think you have a scientific
support to end your TED talk in the
following way
resilient people resilient planet in a
peaceful transformation thank you
[Applause]
