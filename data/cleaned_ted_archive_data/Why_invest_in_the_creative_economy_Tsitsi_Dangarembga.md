hi I was wondering how many people have
spent money recently
to go and watch a movie anybody yes good
how about to go and buy a book fiction a
novel anybody wonderful so many how
about to go to the disco to dance the
night away to music yes I thought so
that&#39;s wonderful it means you have all
participated in the creative economy it
is my great pleasure today to share with
you my passion which is the creative
economy in Africa and to introduce to
you my latest project which is the
culmination of my life&#39;s work which is
called creative Africa creative Africa
is a comprehensive creative economy for
sub-saharan Africa we are doing training
we are doing product development we are
doing
production and we are doing distribution
on several platforms most important of
course in the Internet age is the
Internet the digital platform so why am
I so passionate about the creative
economy well in all my experience as a
copywriter a novelist a playwright a
poet a filmmaker a festival director and
the teacher I have come to realize that
the creative economy is one of the key
strategies for Africa sustainable
development we know the problems we have
on our continent and they can be summed
up in one word poverty yes there has
been economic development in the last
decade or so but it&#39;s tended to stay in
certain sectors of society it hasn&#39;t
trickled down to the people we have
governments in many of our countries
whose policies are not pro citizen and
this tends to exacerbate inequality so
we have a huge issue on our hands and I
believe
that huge issues require big fixes and
for me the big fix is the creative
economy an economy is a system where
value circulates you value music in the
disco you go and pay money that money
then goes on to do other things now in
the traditional economy the things that
are valued are resources like labour
like man&#39;s like raw materials how many
of us have access to those things in
this room not many of us I think with
the creative economy the things that are
valued are the things that we have in
our minds that we have in our hearts and
our souls that we have in our gut our
emotions the creative economy values
those products that come from our
imagination and I always tell my
students when I&#39;m teaching creative
writing that imagination comes from
experience so our experience as who we
are is our raw material as an example of
this I want to tell you about the
Cameroonian born writer in Berlin Bowie
who set a record with the advance for
her first novel of a hundred million
dollars was it it was 1 million excuse
me it was 1 million but anyway that&#39;s a
huge sum of money for a first novel
called behold the dreamers as anyone
read it nobody yet anyway this is her
African story born out of her African
experience values to that extent another
African born writer who has unlocked a
lot of value from her writing is
Chimamanda Adichie Chimamanda Adichie
irregularly goes back to Nigeria where
she&#39;s from and she holds workshops to
enable other young writers to produce
their products she also has a pub
in house where she helps other young
writers to get their products out so
this is the creative economy in action
another thing about the creative economy
is that it is extremely powerful not
only does it put products in markets but
it also puts representations of the
world into society and into our minds
when we engage with these products these
novels these films this music it becomes
part of our experience and so it also
determines who we are and how we see the
world and it also determines how we
relate to ourselves so the creative
economy is very powerful in determining
the kinds of values that are put into
society well organize the creative
economy can put positive values into
society and can help to shape society in
that way an example comes from my work
my novel nervous conditions written many
years ago is a novel about women&#39;s
emancipation I so get invited to read or
to talk about that word and wherever in
the world from Switzerland to South
Africa wherever in the world
I am women come up to me afterwards and
they say thank you so much for that book
it really helped me to work out some of
the issues I had in my life increasingly
in Zimbabwe when I talk to young people
young men they say to me we&#39;re beginning
to realize that we shouldn&#39;t be treating
the women aren&#39;t in our life like that
our sisters and so forth so this is a
power of the creative economy another
power of the creative economy comes from
the fact that it can put into society
new ideas that did not exist in society
a wonderful example comes from Kenya on
Google Earth yong-go everyone&#39;s heard
from googy right
yeah and he&#39;s been writing for decades
on how we can have better communities
better leaders better institutions
better nations
it&#39;s taken time but people have engaged
with these ideas other people have
written about them they have become part
of the discourse the public discourse
and now we see change political change
creeping onto the continent we had
bikina faso a couple of years ago now we
have Gambia now we see what&#39;s happening
in Tanzania so the creative economy is
also very powerful in that respect
people often say that the crisis in
Africa is a crisis of leadership I
always respond by saying I believe that
the crisis in Africa is a crisis of
personhood we don&#39;t know who we are we
don&#39;t have the right values and their
reasons for this some of them economic
the creative economy can lift us out of
poverty because we all have the
resources that are required to
participate in it especially in the
Internet age it can give us positive
representations it can give us ideas
that enable us to make the best of our
nations and our situations a challenge
has been that it was said that
representations of black people do not
find a market their historical reasons
for that that I&#39;m not going to go into I
will say however one of the most
successful films of the last two months
is hidden figures anyone seen hidden
figures yet yes exactly right release on
Christmas Day last year has grossed wait
for it two hundred and twenty seven
point five million that&#39;s on a budget of
25 million and that is a film about
african-american women mathematicians
who helped to put a man on the moon so
yes we can have creative products about
black people in the market that do well
coming closer to home we have Hotel
Rwanda again anybody it&#39;s a little bit
older anybody heard you see that film
had a budget of
seventeen point five million how much
did it gross 33.8 million tidy profit so
it can be done so this is why I say that
smart investment in the creative economy
is one of the things we have to try for
and this is why I have developed my
vehicle creative Africa to cater for
that the challenge that we have is that
the products I have mentioned including
my novel nervous conditions are all
owned of the continent so all those
millions are going off the continents
people are weary they say well can this
work on the continent of Africa there
are so many issues to consider well
let&#39;s consider the issue of Nollywood
that everybody knows about 530 million a
year
turn over from Nollywood Nollywood is
now the second biggest employer in
Nigeria after agriculture is lifting
people out of poverty and it&#39;s giving
them a future at my organization the
Institute of creative arts for progress
in Africa we say when we change Africa
we change the world and I really hope
that you will in the not-too-distant
future be able to engage with the
products that are coming out of creative
Africa and that together we will see
this change taking place on our beloved
continents thank you
[Applause]
