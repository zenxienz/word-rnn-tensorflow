you
[Applause]
hello that that was an involuntary our
movie so they&#39;re everywhere are they
they tell us what to buy they log our
every move they know all of your friends
and they can even drive your car data
can be opinionated know-it-alls with
their evidence and their binary thinking
but I still love them and not just for
their decision-making skills all the way
that they can help us understand the
world better but because they are so
abundant so malleable and so profound
now I make art out of a material called
data and I&#39;m particularly excited about
life data which is data from living
things that can help us translate nature
so that we can get new perspectives and
commissioned by the open data institute
in the space I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve created a
new work called we need us which
explores metadata which is data about
data from the largest citizen science
website in the world called universe and
their website allows anyone to classify
these large datasets about subjects such
as astronomy and biology they have over
a million users who work together
altruistic alee to as a kind of social
machine to classify data and I&#39;ve been
really interested in how I can play with
this data how I can manipulate it to
sort of perform for me so we can expose
the clicks and swipes of users all over
the world so what I do is I take the
metadata from the Zooniverse and I count
all of the users and I count all over
the classifications and I for every
second of every minute and I saw them as
new metadata in a database and then I
look at the frequency of activity over
the past day over the past month and
over the past
our and then I take these rhythms that
are formed and I use them to to
manipulate visual graphic forms and to
playback sound samples in different ways
[Music]
and the data gives this artwork and
impermanence and a constant change the
way that it feeds into the visual
compositions and plays sounds in
different rhythms and that the system
has rules so there are only
quadrilaterals four-sided angular shapes
like the pixels thats it because behind
all of our screens and only flat colors
are used all of the sound recordings are
environmental recordings that have been
processed and manipulated just like the
data has been and it&#39;s a highly
abstracted system visually influenced by
the early 20th century art movement
called suprematism which featured
artists such as Malaya vich and popova
and unlike traditional data
visualization which helps us understand
the information contained within the
data we need us helps us to look in
directly at the data by using
handcrafted algorithms and the
data-driven unpredictability I wanted to
use data to inform the artwork rather
than choreograph in it because I&#39;m
interested in how we can experience the
data how we can feel it as opposed to
just analyze it and researchers in the
UK at the social machine machines
Network have been studying the exact
same data that powers we need us and
then looking and examining this data to
find out how communities can collaborate
to solve problems without the use of
revenues for remote experts or
government intervention and these
scientists are using data as a way to
provide truths about how the word
good works but I&#39;m using data in a
really different ways just as a new art
material and we need us is an easily
shared online open source artwork it&#39;s
not just for the people it&#39;s powered by
people we need us is a living artwork
powered by people thank you
[Applause]
