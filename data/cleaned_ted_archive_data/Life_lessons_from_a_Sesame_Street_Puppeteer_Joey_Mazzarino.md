hey guys I would love to share with you
how I first came to be introduced to
puppetry when I was a kid I was studying
acting in college and I thought that was
what I was going to be and this woman
came in to teach comedy improv and she
worked at Sesame Street her name was
Camille and she was in LA patear now I
was nineteen eighteen years old and I
was still watching Sesame Street because
I just thought was the funniest show on
television and she came in to do the
class I was like oh you got to tell me
what puppets do you do I just gotta know
she goes well I do these things called
anything Muppets they&#39;re not really you
know they&#39;re not big star so I was like
no really I watch every day please tell
me what it is and she said well I just
did a character named Meryl sheep I was
like you did the Sophie&#39;s Choice accent
that was awesome she goes you really
watch the show I was like yes I do and
so she says um would you like to come
and you know Jim Henson&#39;s gonna be there
would you like to meet him now if you
don&#39;t know who Jim Henson was he was a
legend he created the Muppets he created
the Sesame Street characters and
Fraggles and Dark Crystal and everything
else so I was like yes I would like to
meet Jim Henson please
so she said come on down now if the day
you walk on the set of Sesame Street if
you have any connection to the show you
instantly become a five-year-old and I&#39;m
not kidding like college student or
first lady Michelle Obama when she came
on she was like oh you become five
instantly so that&#39;s how I was and
there&#39;s Jim Henson and I get to meet him
Anna and I&#39;m talking to him and I don&#39;t
know what to say and I&#39;m just like I
love puppets right so I don&#39;t know what
to say but this wasn&#39;t even the life
changing things for me I got to stick
around and watch the puppeteers work and
it was a day where we shoot these
sketches these comedy inserts they
called inserts and it was like four of
them and I watched it first of all the
puppets everywhere there&#39;s like chickens
and and talking cheese and like all
these cowboys and everything and there
was one guy&#39;s name was Richard Hunt and
I couldn&#39;t believe it in four different
sketches he did four different
characters a butler and a chicken I
think I don&#39;t even remember what the
other ones were but he did four
different characters and they were all
completely different not only that when
he put on a puppet like he made the
whole crew cracked up between scenes and
I was like I want to be that guy how do
I get to be that guy so I I was telling
everybody like this is what I want to do
I
really want to do it and they&#39;re like
okay and most telling my friends I&#39;m
gonna be a puppeteer and they&#39;re like is
that a job like how can you make money
at that and I even went to Camille and I
said Camille just give you a one thing
well can&#39;t I do and she says well you
know first of all she&#39;s like people who
do this start like when they&#39;re 8 that&#39;s
like I don&#39;t care I&#39;m gonna do this
she said well alright I&#39;ll give you a
little tip she said the first thing you
want to do is it&#39;s just about dropping
the thumb it&#39;s not like this because if
you did that then your puppet would be
going like this so it&#39;s all dropping so
I&#39;m gonna give you your first lesson in
puppetry or your hands out we&#39;re gonna
count no it&#39;s f you drop your thumb on
every syllable we&#39;re gonna count to 10
here we go 1 2 3 I don&#39;t hear you 4 5 6
here&#39;s the tough one 7 you got 2
syllables there a 9/10 when I started I
was like okay I&#39;m gonna do that and I
would be on the phone and I&#39;d be doing
this while I talk to everybody and I&#39;d
be in conversations and I&#39;d be doing
this
talking event people thought I was nuts
so I also thought I need puppets where
am I gonna get puppets I didn&#39;t want
like some toys-r-us puppet I wanted a
real puppet like I saw so I started I
went to the shop at school and then went
around my house and I was like what can
I use and and I built pretty awful
puppets you know they wanted the best
but I just grabbed anything I had I
found this fabric and then I used a book
like the cover of a book to make the
mouse and these were handles on my
parents cabinets and I just painted them
white and then like a friend of mine was
doing a play he needed a floury so can
you make a flower and I said yeah sure I
don&#39;t know how but I will and I found
that it was like a tennis ball and I
covered it in a t-shirt and I put a
spring in its mouth and I just did that
so I did that you know I I did this and
I I started practicing on on a monitor
in my room I would just constantly do
this with the puppets and learn how they
did it I sent in a tape and I got on
Sesame Street and I got to work there
for 25 years and it was awesome but what
does a puppeteer do ok so a puppeteer to
me puppeteer is is magician par magician
because is is that thing alive right now
no it&#39;s not it&#39;s just a thing but when
the puppeteer puts his hands in
oh wow there&#39;s a there&#39;s a lot of people
you didn&#39;t tell them there&#39;s a lot of
people here it just becomes like it
becomes a lot so it&#39;s like a magician
like you took something that wasn&#39;t
alive and you made it come alive awesome
what else is a puppeteer an actor you
look at the puppet and you get it and
you go what kind of character can this
be well he could be nervous like he was
or he could just be like you know mr.
Chopra but hey guy welcome to the
Brooklyn Museum you need a tour around
slap push down be a guy you could be
that guy right or you can see how are
you I really enjoy the room those
glasses they&#39;re very nice so it&#39;s
amazing you can be you could you know
I&#39;m not inhibited by what I look like I
could be anything I want to be so that
was awesome and the puppeteer another
thing a puppeteer was which I thought
was amazing it&#39;s the only sort of
performance art or you can also be the
director because you&#39;re outside your
performance I&#39;ll show you what I mean so
I I&#39;m right here let&#39;s see if it comes
up on the camera here okay
so you don&#39;t see you don&#39;t see that you
don&#39;t see the guy underneath me right
But Here I am right on camera so I can
watch my own performance and I know
where to look where to be Oh am I
looking in the right place hey I should
be on this side of frame I actually no
no I should be back here so you can be a
director and you so you get all these
things so to in this day and age now I
love digital stuff right I love
animation and all that stuff but to me
there&#39;s something so magical I did this
character Murray around the streets of
New York and like you don&#39;t believe it
there was one lady I remember in
Brooklyn she&#39;s Brooklyn she&#39;s in look we
were shoot in Brooklyn and she&#39;s like
smoking a cigarette what shooting here
today and I was like Sesame Street she
saw the pup and she was like oh she
became fine there&#39;s something really
magical that&#39;s seeing these actual
objects it&#39;s what the last speaker was
saying about the Knitting it&#39;s like
seeing that in the in the world and
seeing these in the world so I love
digital animation but I&#39;m hoping there&#39;s
kids out there and they&#39;re looking at
their mom&#39;s coat some ping pong balls
and they&#39;re gonna go I can make a
character out of that thank you guys
