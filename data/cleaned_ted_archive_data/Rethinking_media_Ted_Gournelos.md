so people often ask me why on earth I
ever decided to be a professor and this
is usually less flattering when it&#39;s a
student or a family member but in
general my friends asked me why on earth
I want to be a professor and you know
there&#39;s the holidays that&#39;s great I get
my summer vacations off I&#39;ve you know
get to come in late that&#39;s always
wonderful but it really isn&#39;t those
things it&#39;s that every year my students
come to me and they tell me that my
classes have forever changed the way
they look at television or film and
knowing how to produce media as well as
had a critique media means that that
they actually drive their friends and
family absolutely insane whenever they
sit down to watch the latest episode of
Desperate Housewives or Downton Abbey or
whatever right and my students both love
and hate that part of their education
but more than anything else what it does
is it shows me that we really need to
rethink the way that we conceptualize
media so the framework we always hear
about is that media is one of two things
on the one hand we&#39;ve got the bottom up
or we often call grassroots media and if
you think about it it&#39;s what our media
landscape is what our media scape can do
for us and this is where we got
documentary films online it sort of got
open education like Ted education or the
role of social media in the Middle East
those kinds of things and on the other
hand we&#39;ve got the top down we&#39;ve got
the corporate production model and
that&#39;s what the media scape is doing to
us so that would be controversies over
privacy rules on facebook or those
arcane itunes user agreements that you
just click on and not having any idea
what they actually say or it could be
the gamification of just about
everything from dating to wealth
everything right um so our own voices
our communities somehow get lost in that
top-down bottom-up framework this isn&#39;t
because we&#39;re not there though
instead it&#39;s because it&#39;s so hard
anymore to separate the top down from
the bottom up so your local church or
your local charity group no longer owns
the
at posts on Instagram or on Facebook
right and the images and identities of
celebrities or brands saturate our world
more than they ever have before but at
the same time remember Justin Bieber
Justin Bieber of all things was
discovered on YouTube and your local
food truck or your local farmers market
might depend on Facebook or might depend
on Twitter to actually compete with the
McDonald&#39;s down the road
so in many ways I&#39;d argue that the rise
of digital tools in the classroom in the
home and in the workplace whether it&#39;s
Photoshop to make fun of the latest
celebrity scandal or Reaper to make your
own music and post it on soundcloud or
aftereffects to make a love note for
your spouse is actually where we find
the voices that are shaping what looks a
lot like a media revolution and let me
show you what I mean so this is Elmo but
this is Elmo in a way that you might
never have seen him before
[Music]
feel free to dance of beauty too
you got a love Elmo right okay so this
might not seem revolutionary to you but
it&#39;s what we might call a video mashup
or a culture jam and many of you might
be familiar with those terms
it&#39;s where elements from different media
in this case we&#39;ve got the LOS
angeles-based LMFAO and the kids band
are the kids program Sesame Street are
literally smashed together to create not
only a new whole but a whole set of
conversations and those conversations
are about art they&#39;re about our culture
itself they&#39;re about grassroots media
they&#39;re about Lawrence Lessig talks
about in terms of copyright law
intellectual property this isn&#39;t just
the same old way we used to think about
culture and resistance you know that
would be punk that would be indie that
would be anarchist bakeries you know all
those scary things that we&#39;re supposed
to be afraid of instead it&#39;s a
constantly shifting and evolving
counterculture and this is actually part
of the media scape itself in other words
it&#39;s part of the mainstream so in many
ways this is a like the internet&#39;s
version of graffiti and this story
doesn&#39;t end there nothing is ever simple
you talk about digital culture so while
we&#39;ve got Elmo we&#39;ve also got the
original video for the LMFAO song yes I
know starts the ron jeremy
I&#39;m sexy
you&#39;re welcome
sexy
okay so this isn&#39;t just any videos you
can see it&#39;s a commentary it may be in
the mainstream but it&#39;s about
masculinity it&#39;s about sex it&#39;s about
Fame it&#39;s about the streets of Los
Angeles and despite the crazy hair and
uh let&#39;s call them banana hammocks um
shall we
it just happened to also get nominated
for a Grammy and make their label
millions and millions of dollars but
what does this all mean right if this
goes on in TV why do we even care if it
goes on YouTube and what I&#39;d argue is
that this is a real shift this is where
the YouTube class or the creative class
are actually interested in making new
things even more than they are in
watching old ones so in other words the
logic of digital culture is really the
logic of everything right it&#39;s that
everything is up for grabs it&#39;s that
everything is source material in other
words everything is actually a language
and moreover it it&#39;s a language that we
own it&#39;s a language that we create and
that we can change it will and this is
being integrated into the mainstream
it&#39;s off so technology right there
what&#39;s really interesting about this is
that it means that we need to change
where you think about both the internet
and and our culture right instead of a
bunch of people vacantly watching lost
or vacantly watching Game of Thrones we
have an active audience that&#39;s looking
for things and is easy to use eager to
use the culture that surrounds us to
make new products and to create a
community interested in owning our
digital world not just living in it so
well on the one hand we&#39;ve got Michael
Moore in Morgan&#39;s forest rowlock we
don&#39;t just watch those anymore we might
make Kony 2012 which while controversial
really returned us to the idea of child
soldiers you know we don&#39;t just
appreciate the Beatles or jay-z we might
make
DJ Danger Mouse as the grey album which
is one of the most famous and most
wonderful audio mashups of all time and
we don&#39;t just watch the news anymore if
this passes for news and we don&#39;t even
just watch the news parody
like the daily show what we do is we
auto-tune the news right
we share our disaffection with the
failures of journalism of the failures
of media and these aren&#39;t always perfect
and they are meant to be but what&#39;s
important is that they represent a shift
in the way that media is made the way
that media is shared the way that for me
the way that media is taught in other
words we don&#39;t just watch the media
anymore we actually live it thank you
