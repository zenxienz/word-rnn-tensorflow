hi everybody good morning Vancouver I am
so glad to be here you know why because
I can actually breathe the air every
morning when I wake up I actually check
my phone in Shanghai for the air
pollution levels to see whether or not
my children need to wear a mask to go
out and play on some dice on some days
the pollution outside my window can be
this bad it can go beyond the measurable
index beyond 500 it might even reach a
thousand which is the true air pocalypse
did you know that in Brussels when the
air levels go to 50 they actually stop
all of the car traffic you may or may
not care that an 8 year old girl gets
cancer from nearby coal plants in China
but you should because pollution crosses
borders China&#39;s problem is everybody&#39;s
problems what this means for climate
change and you is is that the decisions
China makes in the next several years on
how it powers its country on how we earn
eyes on how we restructure our economy
are all going it&#39;s playing by itself the
decisions that China makes in the next
several years are going to affect the
world in the next several thousand
China&#39;s emissions are growing alarmingly
fast within a decade
China&#39;s emissions are going to double
the u.s. choking one of China&#39;s leading
visionaries in green buildings probably
said it best when he said that China is
at war with energy actually the world is
at war with energy and China is the
battlefield I would probably go a step
further and say that China is probably
the only batter battlefield that matters
right now to win this battle for the
world China needs everyone to join in
and help turn the tide on its emissions
the reality is is that China&#39;s energy
consumption and emissions are much
larger than they were two decades ago
and they&#39;re going to continue to grow
very fast this is because China is going
undergoing an unprecedented rate of
urbanization one that&#39;s only going to
stop in about 15 years in a 20 year time
frame China is going to have 350 million
people move into cities and this is what
I call the largest animal migration the
world has ever seen
until then China is going to construct 2
billion square meters a year that&#39;s
equivalent to the entire residential
sorry the entire building stock of
Canada and we&#39;re going to build 50,000
new skyscrapers or 10 new york cities in
new floor space so china is building
dense urban cities like this one chan
doos great city because bourbon ization
is the key to helping China move from
survive to thrive to helping children
not have to walk three hours to school
from dark to dark and not having 61
million children left behind so their
parents can go to the cities to find
jobs and all we want is a moderately
comfortable life by Western standards we
want to move from survive to thrive li
Jing Fung one of China&#39;s top sustainable
development advocates likens China to a
teenager except China is no ordinary
teenager it&#39;s actually a teenage young
Ming you can&#39;t simply cap Yao Ming&#39;s
growth in order to cap emissions
that&#39;s like feeding Yao Ming one bowl of
noodles when he really wants to eat
three so the disposable income of an
emeritus person today is just a tenth of
an average American and that&#39;s a lot
better than in 2000 when it was twenty
four times difference
the to improve the living standards
without increasing emissions China must
make some radical changes on a scale
that no other country has done before in
a timeframe that&#39;s nearly impossible so
in other words China is gonna have to
run a marathon at a sprinters pace for
the next couple of decades we need to
make two radical changes the first is to
decouple energy from economic growth
now Sweden has done this before
successfully but it&#39;s obviously on a
much smaller scale and much higher per
capita income the second thing that we
need to do is to decouple emissions from
electricity generation without capping
emissions China is currently on track to
equal us per capita emissions in the
next decade I can&#39;t tell you what a
disaster this will be if this happens so
the decisions that China makes in the
next several years will really determine
whether or not we&#39;re in a climate safe
zone or climate disaster zone and the
problem is is that coal pretty much
equals emissions today in China so to
kick the coal habit that we&#39;ve been
addicted to for the last several decades
we need to revamp infrastructure
significantly and that&#39;s going to take
decades in order to get off coal at a
scale that really matters so the good
news is is that China is already the
largest investor in renewable energy and
on top of that we have 28 new nuclear
power plants that are being built we are
doing some fantastic programs like
pouring 277 billion dollars into air
pollution just three pilots alone 330
billion on water pollution
now just compare that to the 1 billion
dollars that the u.s. announced for
climate resiliency fund so I think that
the thing that I&#39;ve learned over the
last seven years working at juice might
be something that will shine a light a
pathway forward for China and also for
the world so China has six unique
advantages that allow it to become a
green economy faster than any other
country in the world the first one is
pretty obvious in that centralized
control
so the government even with large-scale
privatization has retained an
extraordinary amount of centralized
control and this is really essential
when we&#39;re making large-scale
infrastructure changes for example the
high-speed rail network that started
construction in 2007 in 2012 became the
largest and the fastest high-speed rail
network in the world now compare this to
the California high-speed rail that was
proposed in the 80s and was started what
actually hasn&#39;t started yet I don&#39;t
think
in 2008 China made a decision overnight
to ban free plastic bag giveaways in the
first five years it eliminated sixty
seven billion bags from use the second
characteristic is is that in certain key
areas like power generation in industry
they&#39;re often only a handful of key
decision-makers now this became really
obvious to me when juice created the
juice Smart Grid cooperative and we&#39;re
trying to bring Smart Grid into China
and what we&#39;ve realized in talking to
Chinese experts is that at the time
there was only two Grid companies still
is compare that to 3,200 utilities in
the u.s. in the state grid there&#39;s only
one organization in 2007 that looked at
new technologies like Smart Grid that&#39;s
called separate in separate there was
only two people that actually talked to
foreigners whoosh AHA and by shopping
and so by surrounding these people with
the support from a coalition we paved
the way for China to invest 7 billion
dollars the first tranche of money into
building a smart grid so China is not
just a communist party it&#39;s actually a
multinational corporation the
interesting thing about this is that on
an urban level for example the mayor in
the party secretary are equivalent to a
CEO and a chairman of a board and they
are judged on things like environment as
a key performance indicator that&#39;s how
they get promoted the third
characteristic that Chinese had has is
that it&#39;s very willing to learn from
others so this is something that&#39;s very
deeply ingrained into our psyche and you
can tell because if you
to school a private school they&#39;re more
willing to pay for a foreign teacher
than for of Chinese looking teacher so
these are just some of the coalition&#39;s
on the ground in China that are working
on big efforts to shift climate change
in China these coalition&#39;s need your
support sorry China knows that it
doesn&#39;t have enough solutions it knows
that it&#39;s not innovative enough it knows
that it&#39;s not efficient so to really run
a marathon at a sprinters pace it&#39;s
going to need people from outside to
come into China and help the fourth one
is very surprising that the Communist
Party is really willing to experiment at
large scale so in fact if you look at
one example
they&#39;re now testing carbon emissions
trading schemes to set prices for carbon
in seven regions this is just the first
tranche of pilots so what it&#39;s doing is
it&#39;s taking commercially viable
solutions from around the world
deploying them in multiple cities and if
one of them hits the center it can scale
it across the nation as a model what
this is going to do with economies the
scale is going to bring down prices so
that sustainable solutions are
affordable for the rest of the world so
China has actually moved from just being
the factory of the world to becoming the
clean tech laboratory of the world now
this is not radical innovation like
Silicon Valley this is what I like to
call tweak evasion because of tweak
evasion though China in 20 years you&#39;re
going to think well maybe it&#39;s not just
the chief polluter anymore it&#39;s now the
chief solutions provider the fifth
advantage is that China&#39;s really willing
to change in the last 30 years or so
every five years China&#39;s practically a
new country from Internet to
infrastructure from food to fashion so
what this provides us an opportunity to
do is to take the 800 million emerging
middle class and help move them from
these Panda
images of gold toilets and Kim
Kardashian bling dreams and move them to
a China dream to what Chinese really
want which is being able to spend time
with our loved ones or family and
friends the sixth one is that China is
highly motivated the story of climate
change is not centered around polar
bears right it&#39;s about near-term Chinese
interests the first one is that
pollution is really bad as Gavin
mentioned earlier we&#39;re desperately
looking for solutions today and this
makes our cities barely livable it
really threatens social stability and it
threatens our better city our better
life and our hope for a China dream the
other one is is that China unlike the US
has far fewer resources to support four
times the amount of population and so if
we don&#39;t become a more resource
efficient and energy independent nation
this is going to threaten our economic
stability and our national security
this is far in way it&#39;s great motivation
for us to go and do most of the things
that are necessary to tackle climate
change on the ground so you might think
that China&#39;s problems are too large to
solve or that you as one person can&#39;t
make a difference but what I&#39;ve just
shown you is that change can happen at
Giga scale China is the only country in
the world that&#39;s building new countries
at a time and mastering change at good
scale and so because of these six
advantages in contrast to the rest of
the world where change requires
broad-based consensus China can actually
make small precise focused interventions
what I call acupuncture points this is
sort of a general map of what I like to
call the most important acupuncture
points a lot of work is already being
done on the ground in China like at this
I know finished Tongji Center
finished center at the Tongji University
working on designing dense livable
cities or Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
working on energy efficiency for a heavy
heavy industry but these collisions are
not enough they need your support I
think one of the most interesting things
that I&#39;ve learned at Juice is is that
the coalition&#39;s that are most effective
in China have four things one is this
it&#39;s not just technologies that are
being imported into China that they have
integration experts that know how to
apply these technologies into a pathway
that makes sense for China and cultural
bridges because the culture of China is
really 180 degree opposite of the West
now you might think well I don&#39;t know
much about China I don&#39;t know much about
technology but if you know how to run
teams if you know how to help diverse
teams be more effective we could use
your help on the ground collaboration
coaches and what I&#39;d like to tell my
team at juice is that half the value of
these coalition&#39;s is how to tell the
story of the big shift so that all the
stakeholders are really excited so in
conclusion maybe you&#39;re thinking that it
takes a large nation to make this happen
that it&#39;s going to take superhuman
effort but it doesn&#39;t take a 1.3 billion
people to make this happen it only takes
a few passionate individuals working on
some strategic coalition&#39;s on the ground
with very few decision makers to make
transformative change that just may save
the world so if you are frustrated
wherever you are about the slow progress
the world is making on climate change or
pollution
why aren&#39;t you in China yet come to
China support us or bring your time and
your resources if I would have one wish
that would be that you in this audience
would be to do exactly that
join one of these college coalition&#39;s or
start your own here because nowhere else
in the world
can we make so much progress together so
fast so I invite you to join me
before it&#39;s too late but as I&#39;ve shown
you there is a light at the end of this
path in that light I hope we&#39;ll start
with you thank you very much
[Applause]
