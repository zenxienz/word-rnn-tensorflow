so what do you see when you look around
everyone take a look around of course
you see teens and peers but what I see
is that this room has been illuminated
with the brilliance and energy everyone
brought in here I see
contributors to our earth my interest in
the environment started when I was in
elementary school my grandmother had
this beautiful garden with all kinds of
exotic fruit trees and monarch
butterflies and my grandfather he loved
to fish and hike so I would often help
out in the garden or go on his little
fishing trips with him by the nearby
lake I visit that Lake a few years later
it was fenced off by the fishing
industry and the water was black with
pollutants and from that moment I forced
myself to spring into action we are the
generation of problem solvers we already
know to recycle papers and plastics and
eternal flights when no one&#39;s in the
room but because I would say we are more
innovative and resourceful than that
that we can come up with better and
newer solutions and it starts simply
when you walk into your room you
shouldn&#39;t turn on the air-condition or
the heater instead just open windows or
bundle up the average homeowner spends a
thousand dollars a year to heat or cool
their home not only will we save money
but will prevent the 3,500 pounds of
carbon dioxide and 31 pounds of sulfur
sulfur dioxide it takes to run it and a
setting those long thoughtful showers
take instead what we like to call it
navy showers and save a shower thoughts
for another time I know if you don&#39;t
take those long showers you won&#39;t be
able to develop your scientific
breakthroughs and answers to the meaning
of life but also keep in mind that the
average 10-minute shower uses 40 gallons
of water and the average bath uses 70
gallons I&#39;m from Los Angeles and right
now the weather there is unbearably hot
so we&#39;re running out of water some say
we have just enough for a year supply so
most residents there are switching to
drought tolerant plants which by the way
are not just cacti but we can&#39;t just not
use water
greenhouse gas bill that leads to hotter
weather this people need more water to
keep themselves cool and hydrated that
creates what seems to be an almost
endless cycle or what we like to call a
positive feedback loop but list for what
we can do is endless - you can switch to
LED light bulbs compost raised worms use
reusable water bottles bike or walk
carpool shop locally use your usable
grocery bags I can go on for days and I
know everyone&#39;s getting tired they only
gave me three minutes anyway so I&#39;ll
leave you with this remember when I
asked you to look around the room the
answer to that should be clear now this
is a roomful of contributors to the
earth adults right now are doing a
magnificent job ATS promoting
sustainability but we will be the ones
to take charge next so we have to show
them that we are capable we are
intelligent we have to show them that
teens are better and everything
