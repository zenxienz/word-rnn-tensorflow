thank you so much hi everybody I&#39;m
Maggie I&#39;m Denise Maggie do you remember
when dad used to say kids today have too
much time too much money and no
responsibilities and I&#39;m gonna give you
no time no money and a lot of
responsibilities we were like gee thanks
dad that sounds like a lot of fun yeah
we had terrific parents that instilled a
nice at an early age the art of
responsibility and they did it through
an interesting technique called the job
jar so Denise and I have two other
sisters as well so we had four job jars
set up in our kitchen and every Saturday
my mom and dad would put chores inside
the job jar that we would have to
complete by the following Saturday in
order to get our allowance and the job
jars taught us a lot of lessons I mean
in fact we could select our chore and if
we didn&#39;t really like it we could
negotiate it so it taught us the art of
bartering and these they were like our
score cards just like report cards
because it really was about goal
achievement you had to complete your
chore by the end of the week and we
never ever thought about what happens if
we don&#39;t complete them because we were
taught at a very early age that results
matter and it was a pay-for-performance
system because that&#39;s how we earned our
allowance and it was a team sport too
because we would take all the jobs out
every Saturday after about the first
couple Saturdays I would that you know
the novelty wore off and then we just
look at all the chores that we had to do
we&#39;d start to do our bartering back and
forth but we could really see the big
picture of everything that had to get
done in our household on a weekly basis
so it really taught us not just to think
about the small things you got to do but
what the big impact was and they helped
shape our lives when you think about the
lessons learned it shaped our career
paths and our leadership styles so let&#39;s
do some lessons learned we&#39;ll show you
how we use the jobs are
what did you get I got risk-taking
business planning I want risk-taking
no no I&#39;m that risk-taking all right
take business planning but you can go
first oh well thank you very much so
when I think about business planning I
think about when we were young I was 12
years old and I wanted to get my ears
pierced and so I had to put a business
plan together for my parents to convince
them that there was value associated
with me getting my ears pierced needless
to say the first time I was shot down
they said now they said it&#39;s too
expensive and we&#39;re really not quite
sure with the value and of course my
father in His infinite wisdom said well
if you were meant to have holes in your
ears you would have been born with them
remember screw back I know I&#39;m gonna
wear them for a year so I had a regroup
I went back and I thought okay how can I
make this value-added yeah I said aha my
sister Denise so I went to Denise and I
said why don&#39;t you get your ears pierced
with me I can do this two for the price
of one we could share earrings and I
could put a plan together that they&#39;d
approve so Denise lent me her ears we
got our ears pierced because I got this
approved and all was well from the
business plan perspective so it taught
us early on to have a clear vision to
think about what the benefits and the
risks are and the measurements of
success and if you don&#39;t succeed at
first you try try again speaking of
which our youngest sister Andrea wanted
a horse when she was young and it took
her a year and a half to get that horse
but every week on my mother&#39;s grocery
shopping list she put one horse any kind
it didn&#39;t matter
so we&#39;ve been used to business planning
I know in my career I do a lot of
business plans and its really helped me
from what I learned when I was young
including an eight point six billion
dollar acquisition I did for our company
just three years ago woohoo and triple
the size of frontier so risk-taking so
now I have risk-taking
so when when I was in high school it was
the early 70s there were two women&#39;s
sports cheerleading or pathan twirling I
didn&#39;t make the cheerleaders and I was
devastated
so I went out for baton twirling but I
didn&#39;t want to just patrol a baton I
wanted to do something that wasn&#39;t
ordinary I wanted to twirl fire and it
was the first calculated risk and I
remember I had to practice and prepare
for this execution on the halftime show
and my mother instead of telling me I
couldn&#39;t do it which I can&#39;t was not in
our vocabulary it was how can you my
mother sewed a flame-retardant outfit
and then stood on the football field
with a blanket just in case the
calculated risk did not work out but it
didn&#39;t we held her silver girl all the
little girl she was silver girl on the
field yes yes so anyway that calculated
risk taught me a lot of value in terms
of how to do something that was an
average that wasn&#39;t ordinary and it was
worth it for the pleasure that it
brought the crowd now fast forward to
Campbell Soup Company and last year I
made three acquisitions one was the
acquisition of Bolthouse farms which is
the largest acquisition in our company&#39;s
144 year history and Bolthouse farms for
those who know it or don&#39;t know it is a
leader in super-premium fresh healthy
beverages salad dressings and carrots
and skeptics said carrots Denise really
I said no packaged fresh it&#39;s a twelve
billion dollar category growing at six
to seven percent per year and Campbell&#39;s
deserves a place in the fresh food
business I fundamentally believe that it
was a calculated risk and I&#39;m still
twirling fire
so back to the job jar would you get
innovation
so did I anything you go first okay so
why does she always do this to me so
innovation when I think about innovation
and I think about us being young I think
about continuous innovation you know
we&#39;ve all heard incredible people on
this stage talk about breakthrough
innovation but there&#39;s also continuous
innovation that&#39;s important because for
sustainability you have to continue to
improve and change in the environment
you&#39;re in as Denise mentioned her
company&#39;s one hundred and forty four
years old I&#39;m going on 80 at frontier so
we have to innovate constantly and one
of the innovation lessons we learned
early on is when I was about seven and
Denise was eight we used to watch a show
on television called Wonder AMA now most
of you in this room have never heard of
that show but it was a children&#39;s show
and every year at springtime they would
have kits for carnivals that you could
write in an order and you could do a
carnival to raise money for muscular
dystrophy which Denise and I decided to
do so we got our kit we were so excited
and we did posters and we wrote our
bikes around the neighborhoods and put
signs up all over the place and we
recruited our neighborhood friends to
come and work the carnival with us and
we did penny games and we raised $25
that first carnival that&#39;s a lot of
pennies and we learned the art of
advertising marketing project management
persuasion and continuous improvement
because we did those carnivals for five
years and we raised more money every
year we did it and we learned to make a
profit and make a difference absolutely
well innovation I remember that my
dinner table your dinner table was the
perfect focus group for my father who
wasn&#39;t an executive at AT&amp;T and he
brought to that dinner table all kinds
of test market ideas and new products
like the trim line phone or the princess
phone which were innovations in their
day call-waiting and it wasn&#39;t just
show-and-tell on the part of my father
it was actually debate and in
put it was really great training we
didn&#39;t know it at the time but my father
was a visionary and he said to us I
believe someday the world is going to
open up to women and I want you to be
prepared for that because my dad thought
that women should have a seat at the
table and he was right absolutely but we
also had pink princess phones too yes so
why don&#39;t you wrap up with some give
back here yes one of the things that is
really important we believe is sharing
and giving back some of these life
lessons even if their life lessons from
a job jar and one of the things I&#39;ll
pass on is the importance of creating a
plan for yourself and the observation is
and it really came from an insight I had
in my career and it was you know we&#39;re
strategic about brands and we&#39;re
strategic about companies but we&#39;re not
strategic about ourselves and if you
step back and look at your career as a
plan it&#39;s where have you been where are
you going what do you want to be and how
do you get there and then who can help
you and building relationships is the
second key tip and building
relationships as your ability will get
you so far but your relationships will
get you the rest of the way and my
sister Maggie is one of the best
networkers and relation builders I know
and networking is working it&#39;s not
fooling around it&#39;s really important and
then finally I went to Toledo one on
vacation has anybody been to Toledo on
vacation no there&#39;s nothing to do so I
wrote a personal mission it was inspired
by the book seven Habits of Highly
Effective People by Stephen Covey and my
mission is to serve as a leader live a
balanced life and apply ethical
principles to make a significant
difference that was 1994 it hasn&#39;t
changed because part of leadership is
knowing who you are and what you stand
for so others can follow you and so I&#39;m
paying it forward and giving back to pay
my parents back for all the support that
they gave me and our parents have been
terrific in our lives there&#39;s no doubt
about that and Denise was so eloquent on
that the only thing I&#39;m going to add is
one of the things that I focus a lot on
is making sure that
advanced women I&#39;m in a position I can
do that I sit on corporate boards I run
a fortune 500 company and I believe you
bring women along when I joined frontier
a little over nine years ago there were
no women on our board today we have five
women on our board and two
african-american men Campbell&#39;s to five
so 60% of my board members are diverse
when I joined the company at that same
time there was one woman at a vice
president level or above out of the top
100 people in the company today if you
look at the top seven women in our
company it&#39;s top top seven people for
our women and if you look at my
leadership in Regional Operations 50% of
all the people at P&amp;L responsibility are
women in our company and I&#39;m I&#39;m also
very proud that I am one of the
cofounders of a group called women in
America which is takes place in the New
York area where there&#39;s about 30 or 40
women executives denise is part of the
group too because of course I roped her
into it but we man targeted young women
in their late 20s through their 40s to
help in their mid-career to accelerate
that career we do a two-year class with
each group and I&#39;m so thrilled because
we&#39;re starting our third class in
February with 40 magnificent mentees and
that&#39;s reverse mentoring who we we
learned so much from that is really
great but I do want to end by saying the
most important mentor in my life is my
sister Denise and I love her for that I
love
thank you thank you everybody
