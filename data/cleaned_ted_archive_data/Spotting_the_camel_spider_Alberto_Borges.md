have you ever seen a creature that is 5
inches long and is pound-for-pound on at
the fastest and toughest or not well I
hadn&#39;t but this is the story of how I
found on to enough years ago when I was
17 and how it rapidly changed my life
Norton Kenya especially masturbate the
land of tusks is a very hot and dry
desert with volcanic cones lava flows
and spectacular ground craters I read
about these places just up just after
high school and its really stud and
interest meet one day one a visit them
this would be this stories have been
written in books and journals by early
explorers such as Donaldson Smith County
Leakey and John Hill abhi so young and
with a foolhardy passion to explore the
land of wonder I hid strike as young as
I was through the length and breadth of
my Sabbath naturally mom was against the
idea but I talked that into allowing me
and off I went
luck struck on my very first visit who
could have ever imagined that life could
exist in this mars-like landscape
while photographs in this scorching lava
rocks beyond the remote Shelby Desert I
was rewarded with an extremely rare
occurrence of a large and strikingly
beautiful creature but it all happened
so quick that I never got a glimpse of
it it&#39;s comfort under those rocks and
simply disappeared I did not think much
about it then but a week later I was
back in a row basalt in these images
with my father when he pointed out and
exclaimed what a strange spider look
tusks and legs next day rushed to the
National Museums of Kenner to inquire
about it after a couple of hours
searching the scientists conclude that
probably was a new species of its kind
with the assistance of the museum I made
three expeditions to such and capture
water now christened Goldie eventually
this led to the National Geographic
Society awarding me a grant to further
research on them the grant was enough to
support a small team dedicated to not
and Kenner comprising of some local
guides scientists Purina Boyd from South
Africa in the middle there and mr. my
Clifton off the Nairobi Museum standing
next to me in this image and here is
Goldie it&#39;s a pretty amazing creature
isn&#39;t it for its size Gold is one of the
fastest and creatures or not and can
give Usain Bolt around for his medals
however they do not bolt in a straight
line like him but run very erratically
dodging rocky obstacles along the way
this creature has its head and jaws as
you can see nearly a third of their body
size the bite is very powerful but not
venomous to give you an idea of how big
gold is I&#39;d like everyone to put their
palms out like this now imagine Goldie
is sitting on a golden wood spun from
your wrist to your fingertips for the
average sized and the image you see
there is the only one ever taken of
Goldie and as remain so and that image
belongs to me
so therefore most thought in your mind
is what is this creature
well the commonly known as camel spiders
or some spiders scientifically they are
called Soloff ug solitudes arachnids
that are distantly related to scorpions
spiders mites and ticks they&#39;re little
known as they are rarely seen generally
there are two groups day and night night
active ones tend to be dull looking
whilst the active ones such as Goldie a
brightly colored I&#39;d like you to
carefully notice its legs they&#39;re all
different sized with the largest at the
back end and the shortest in the front
this is an amazing adaptation that camel
spiders have that enable them to run
very fast without tripping over
themselves what appears to be a pair of
legs in the forefront is actually a pair
of peda bulbs that&#39;s falling one into
thinking they&#39;re creatures with ten legs
this pedi bulbs that act as fillers
actually have a sect Oriole organ at the
tip with which they can grab flying
insects such as Maude&#39;s out of the air
during our recent expedition we found
out that camel spiders excavate an
activity of sleeping underground during
extremely dry spells waiting patiently
for the rains to fall day after imagine
this is similar to hibernation except
hibernation is done in extremely cold
months this is an image of critters we
found that are so small nearly as if you
can see these creatures these are
beetles wasp and slice that are so tiny
they are roughly a millimeter as long as
you can see they&#39;re not close up to all
the children and young people watching
these parents and grandparents
let&#39;s plenty to see learn and discover
out there and I wish to encourage each
one of you to put down and switch off
your technologies and explore the minute
of
explore the many exciting opportunities
awake in the field of geography and
natural sense but you can do this
Valentine&#39;s or Easter is buy yourself a
pair of binoculars compass on a map and
just go outdoors you never know what you
could discover out there thank you
[Applause]
