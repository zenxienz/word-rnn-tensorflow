there was someone we just
to invite to this conference this
evening he brought us all to our feet
for four years ago and changed many of
our minds about deep issues moved us so
deeply I think the longest standing o it
and Ted&#39;s history he got so he&#39;s welcome
back to the stage a short notice Brian
Stevenson
drunk
I mean we just have to hear it in your
words what what this means to you and
how you got here I really believe that
in America were not free we are burdened
by a history of racial inequality and
injustice it compromises us it
constrains us we have been infected by
the racial injustice that we have
tolerated the plight of indigenous
people who are the victims of a genocide
that we&#39;ve never really acknowledged
haunts us we live with the legacy of
slavery and that legacy has created a
shadow that undermines so many of our
best efforts to get to something that
looks like justice the great evil of
American slavery was an involuntary
servitude and forced labor to me the
great evil of American slavery was the
narrative of racial difference that we
created to legitimated it&#39;s the ideology
of white supremacy that we made up to
make ourselves feel comfortable with
enslaving people who are black and we
never address that that legacy we have
in the 13th amendment language that
prohibits involuntary servitude in
forced labor we never talked about the
narrative of racial differences because
of that I don&#39;t believe that slavery
ended in 1865 I think it it turned into
decades of terrorism and violence and
the lynching that we are trying to
memorialize terrorize people of color in
this community we&#39;ve never talked about
it
thousands of people pulled into the
courthouse square sometimes brutalized
burned alive the demographic geography
of this nation was shaped by terrorism
the black people in Cleveland and
Chicago and Detroit in Los Angeles and
Oakland in New York and Boston didn&#39;t go
to those communities as immigrants
looking for new economic opportunities
they went to those communities as
x-files and refugees from terrorism in
the American South and they are burdened
by that history and we never really
dealt with it even during the civil
rights era I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve
confronted all of the pain and anguish
that was created by decades of
segregation we said to black people
you&#39;re not good enough to vote just
because you&#39;re black we said the black
kids you can&#39;t go to school with other
kids because you&#39;re black I started my
education at a colored school my parents
were humiliated every day of their lives
when they saw those signs that said
white and colored they weren&#39;t direction
they were assaults and we haven&#39;t tried
to address them we try to press on and
now there is a presumption of
dangerousness and guilt that follows
black and brown people in this country
it is the reason why kids are being
killed on the streets by police officers
and we cannot recover from that until we
commit ourselves to a process of truth
and reconciliation so I think this
matters because we&#39;ve got to create a
new relationship to this history of
giving a talk one time in an older man
came into the church while I was talking
he was in a wheelchair older black man
he was sitting in the back and when I
was looking at when I was talking he was
looking at me so hard with such
intensity had this very angry almost
kind of mean look on his face I was
distracted by him and I got through my
talk and people came up after the talk
they were very nice very appropriate but
that man kept sitting in the back
staring at me I couldn&#39;t figure out why
he was staring at me so hard and finally
when everybody else left he got some
young kid to wheel him up to me at the
front of the church and he came down
that center aisle and he got in front of
me he put his hand up and he said do you
know what you&#39;re doing and I just stood
there and I looked at him and he asked
me again he said do you know what you&#39;re
doing and I step back and I mumbled
something didn&#39;t you ask me one more
time he said do you know what you&#39;re
doing and then he looked at me I&#39;m going
to tell you what you&#39;re doing and this
older man looked at me and he says
you&#39;re beating the drum for justice you
keep beating the drum for justice and I
was so moved I was also really relieved
because I just didn&#39;t know what he was
going to do and then he grabbed me by
the jacket and he pulled me into his
wheelchair he the come here come here
come here I want to show you something
and this older man turned his head and
he said you see the scar I had behind my
right ear he said I got that scar in
Greene County Alabama in 1963 trying to
register people to vote he turned his
head he said you see this cut I have
down here the bottom of my neck he said
I got that cut in Philadelphia
Mississippi 1964 trying to register
people to vote he turned his head he
said you see this bruise it says I got
my bruise in Birmingham Alabama 1965
trying to register people to vote he
said I&#39;m going to tell you something
young man he said people look at me they
think I&#39;m some old man sitting in a
wheelchair covered with cuts and bruises
and scars but I want to tell you
something he said these aren&#39;t my cuts
these aren&#39;t my bruises these aren&#39;t my
scars he said these are my medals of
Honor
I tell you that because our history has
scarred us it has bruised us it has
injured us but when we tell the truth
about that history we change things and
I believe that if we create spaces like
this where we resurrect the truth where
we change the iconography of the
Americans landscape we will get to
something that feels more like freedom
we can achieve something that looks more
like justice we can accomplish changing
this narrative that burdened us and I
believe resurrect the hope that I think
animates many of us would be in this
space there is something better than
what we&#39;ve experienced and we could
achieve it when we begin to tell the
truth and that&#39;s why I&#39;m excited about
these kinds of projects it&#39;s not only
appropriate but it&#39;s necessary and when
we do it I think we will find ourselves
standing maybe for the first time freer
more just more motivated more liberated
from this history that is so condemned
that&#39;s why I think it matters and I&#39;m so
excited about it from
[Music]
Santeria
[Music]
they&#39;ve been working with with Michael
on this project what would you make of
his design I&#39;m very excited about it I
think it&#39;s it&#39;s got the features that we
want it&#39;s a place that will be beautiful
it&#39;s a place that will tell a hard story
a necessary story but you can&#39;t go to
South Africa without seeing these
incredibly difficult but important
monuments and memorials to apartheid you
can&#39;t go to Rwanda without being
reminded you go to Berlin Germany you
can&#39;t go 100 metres without seeing a
marker or a stone that&#39;s been placed at
the home of the Jewish family that was
abducted during the Holocaust the
Germans actually want you to go to
Auschwitz and reflect soberly on the
history of the Holocaust we do the
opposite in this country and I think
this kind of space will invite us to do
the hard sobering unclamp
for the Flemish and look at this truth
and I think it has the kind of
architectural integrity that makes it
possible for even those of us who are
worried and shamed to feel some
opportunity for reconciliation Brian
Stevenson thank you for so much thank
you
