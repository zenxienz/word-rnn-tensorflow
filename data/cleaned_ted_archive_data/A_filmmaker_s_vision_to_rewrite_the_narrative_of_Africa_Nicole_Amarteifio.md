watching reruns of one of my favorite TV
shows sex in the city when I couldn&#39;t
help but wonder what can I do to fight
the single story of Africa what can I do
to change a conversation about my
country and about my continent from the
reoccurring theme of war poverty and
famine I was kind of confused as to why
those deeply seeded questions that I&#39;ve
had my entire life would pop into my
head while watching a show like Sex in
the City but that&#39;s what happened and I
think it happened because it was the
answer to fight the single-story of
Africa instead of following the sexual
escapades of a group of women in New
York City I could follow the sexual
escapades of a group of a group of women
from my city Accra Ghana so that&#39;s what
I did this is the web series and African
City it&#39;s a story of five successful
beautiful African females Ghanaian and
Nigerian Nani Asha de Makena and gauzy
and Zainab raised in the West but
migrating back home to their place of
birth Accra Ghana just like I did they
are single they are fabulous and they
are dating
and the dating escapades no longer
marginalized as women from the African
continent into nameless victims on the
front cover of poverty reports but
active participants in this worldwide
human emotion that we are all looking
for love what&#39;s been great about this
journey is writing about sex love and
relationships the stories around these
three things connects us in our
similarities globally this is why my
favorite comment on YouTube is a woman
who wrote I was born in Puerto Rico I
live in New York I&#39;ve spent a lot of
time in Italy but what do I have in
common with these girls
everything the image of this story has
been on L on BBC on NPR on CNN basically
it&#39;s been in media outlets around the
world and why that&#39;s important to me is
because I&#39;m hoping it will it will
change the narrative that there&#39;ll be a
turning point in the narrative of Africa
a shift in the narrative of Africa and
even if the shift may be small the
trajectory could be great this is why I
consider an African city more than just
a TV show
it&#39;s a movement armored in the outfits
of Ghanaian fashion designers a mayo and
Christy Brown it sends a message we will
no longer tolerate the single now door
of Africa surrounded by the music of
Ghanaian musicians Brianne Benson and
Lady Jaye it sends the message we will
no longer tolerate the single narrative
of Africa decorated in the home decor of
set designers doll living and blueprint
Africa it sends the message we will no
longer tolerate the single narrative of
Africa we&#39;ll be creating more stories
stories with global visibility stories
that are my Ghana your Ghana our Africa
but in creating this the series I&#39;ve
been struck by some of the criticism in
me and others trying to take the pen out
of the hands of the West there&#39;s this
frenzy over who should hold the pen our
Africans living abroad allowed to hold
it our Africans who were raised abroad
like I was allowed to hold it is the pen
only allowed to be held by those who
never left the continent
are you all allowed to hold the pen if
you are less fortunate this privilege
exempts you from the right to hold the
pen there&#39;s a lot of bickering over what
is African and what is authentically
African policing Africanism policing
what is authentically African and the
bickering is exhausting the pen is big
enough first all the battle is not with
each other at least it shouldn&#39;t be
we are on the same team with the same
ultimate goal all the stories from the
Dark Continent rhetoric to the Africa
rising rhetoric a valid because there
are parts of our continent that are dark
and there are parts of our continent
that are on the rise and then there&#39;s a
human stories in between and then
dailies five women and the men they date
let&#39;s change the narrative find what
inspires you know what your Africa is
and then find the right digital platform
to share that story with the world and
if and if the inspiration for one of
those stories are the many stories
needed comes from a device that women
use to massage their backs well that
would be just fabulous thank you
