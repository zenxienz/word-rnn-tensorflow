when I arrived in Canada filled out my
immigration form I wrote down my
profession as an adventurer adventure is
not only just a way of life but it is my
full-time professional career these days
now if we don&#39;t actually witness
adventure does it have any value well
adventure done for the sake of itself
really is the purest form of all but as
soon as we wave a camera at adventure
then we can capture that experience
forever and share it with the world a
world hungry for action ever since being
involved in action sports I&#39;ve realized
there is an audience out there that
loves seeing pictures like this now my
profession has become possible through
three basic elements firstly social
networking second online video web
hosting like YouTube and thirdly
wearable cameras sports cameras are the
most invaluable utility available for
the modern-day adventurer the
possibilities are endless and today I
wanted to tell you how now when I
captured this photograph of the woman
standing on the back of the wing Souter
I knew I had a window of less than half
a second to achieve this shot now while
skydiving I&#39;m up there in 200 kilometers
an hour of wind so to operate a camera
i&#39;m using a switch in my mouth operated
by my tongue because i need my
hands-free for flying so as she stood up
on the back of the wing suitor ah got
the shot
one instant later she was blown off and
that 200 kilometer an hour wind yeah now
I want to show you some video of the
base jump from a few different angles
and the old days before these small
cameras to capture three different
angles on a jump I would need to jump
three times now with these small cameras
I can actually do one jump and get all
the angles that I need to tell a video
story perhaps making my job a wee bit
safer
so you got your hand cam shot this is
the head cam and this is NSYNC and foot
can just for a little bit of flavor yeah
I know it&#39;s pretty silly we now no
longer need a production team to come
along and catch our videos for us
because we can actually do it ourselves
now traditionally action sports are
awfully hard to capture with the larger
cameras because they happen thousands of
feet up via sports cameras are a game
changer we can now mount them in the
kinds of places that a large camera just
won&#39;t go we can put them on skis
mountain them on a kayak we can use them
in the air and in the water the
technology has changed in two major ways
firstly the cameras are so small they
can be warm and secondly consumers can
now own a high quality video camera
capable of shooting and 4k resolution
the current industry standard all for
the modest price of six hundred dollars
but there is more to it than just the
size and the cost of these cameras
because in the past the networks held
the monopoly on broadcast video they
would shoot the action with your
expensive broadcast cameras own the
video and make the money while the
person at the front doing the dangerous
stuff normally didn&#39;t get paid but you
got your face on telly
now through wearable cameras we can
shoot our own high quality footage
edited on a home computer upload it to
youtube and then share our creations to
an ever increasing international
audience hungry for action now action
video really is as much about what the
audience wants to see as it is about the
adventure of themselves because it&#39;s the
audience that is the market production
power is now in the hands of the people
and there&#39;s more to it than just
entertainment sports cameras are an
invaluable learning tool as part of the
New Zealand parachute team we used
aerial video to analyze our training
jumps greatly accelerating a learning
process through being able to review our
jumps over and over again because the
eye in the sky never lies Island how to
do a BASE jumping backflip a gainer just
by watching videos also did some
acrobatic training but achieve this
without a real cheetah ever being
present competitive skydiving has
changed in the past judging used to be
done from the ground through huge
binoculars in real time but now one
member of the parachute team is the
camera fly and it&#39;s their job to follow
the action capture the video so the
judges can score it traditionally the
fringe sports didn&#39;t get much coverage
on the major TV networks and they have
been big winners through the use of
sports cameras we can now see what it&#39;s
like to surf inside a barrel kayak down
a waterfall jumper motocross bike or ski
an ally loan and because the video that
these cameras can capture has changed
it has also changed the experience for
you the viewers let&#39;s have a look at my
first jump off a brand-new cliff without
the use of sports cameras
therapy is the real name for this place
too yippy yo G was he comes the ground
aw she was aw crikey oh yeah you should
see it from my direction this shot was
done with your classic external third
person view so the view we get is from
the outside looking in as if we are
spectators and contrast to this wearable
cameras can now give us an onboard view
or the POV shot the point of view short
what this does is it brings you into the
action as if you actually there with us
notice the difference perspective in
this video this is a shot at home in New
Zealand two weeks ago
you see a whole new perspective what
these cameras do is they show you what
we see you have been brought into the
action as if you were actually there as
if you are a participant but the POV
shot only shows a part of the action
only so much as seen there&#39;s no real
context with the outside world and this
photograph shows how that style of jump
was actually done and how it looks from
the outside now some may say there is a
dangerous provocation with this kind of
video pushing people participants and
viewers into dangerous areas and doing
dangerous stuff well I believe Helen
Keller&#39;s beautiful quote that life is a
daring adventure or nothing at all sums
it up for me without accepting some
measure of risk and our lives will never
ever be able to progress in the world
and reach New Horizons now to come clean
this is an x-ray of my neck after I
broke it in a motorbike accident in 1997
I was into adventure before this but
after my accident I decided to become a
full-time adventurer because life is
short it is I look up to my adventurous
heroes the likes of sir edmund hillary
and tenzing conquering Everest and Chris
Hadfield walking in space I take huge
inspiration from their acts and deeds
and those two things summiting Everest
and space travel at one time were both
known to be impossible things and I to
love doing impossible things every time
I talk to people about doing a parachute
jump with a tent just like this one yes
a tent all I got was the thousand-yard
stare
and comments like oh do you really scare
us some days so naturally we videoed
this attempt and his five cameras to do
it one of my foot one on the helmet one
on the helicopter a gyro stabilized
camera and the second helicopter in one
on the ground I wonder if it will work
oh look at that who would have thought
it was possible to jump 18
the trick is making something look
dangerous initially they read the police
know reasonably yeah reasonably safe I&#39;m
still in one piece so there is proof of
that sports cameras give us the unusual
angles that we just can&#39;t get any other
way whether they mounted on body parts
or in sports equipment the possibilities
are endless due to their tiny size
production power is now in the hands of
all adventurers no matter who you are
young or old we can more easily than
ever transmit the spirit of adventure to
the world through video we can learn
from the shared experiences of others
and feed off the inspiration they
provide and take the world in a whole
new direction now I believe these
cameras are so successful because our
audience loves to see real people doing
real adventure in the real world no
scripts no actors this is the purest
form of adventure you will ever see
because it is real so truth and dare I
do you all to dream big be inspired and
discover a new truth for yourselves
thank
you
