okay so I&#39;m gonna talk about models
today and let&#39;s look at this first model
here you see something up there that you
know it&#39;s not a model it&#39;s the earth but
on the side I have another model that&#39;s
a great model of the globe the globe is
a model of the earth it&#39;s not the earth
but it&#39;s very useful and then on the
other side I have a computer model of
the earth also it&#39;s useful in different
ways and it does different things it&#39;s
not the earth and then I have two
equations one for the surface area of
the earth and one for the volume of the
earth so we can represent the earth in
lots of different ways with these models
so let&#39;s look at some physics and use
that to make another model so suppose I
took a ball and I and I throw it but I&#39;m
standing on ice well I have to push the
ball in order to move it and so it&#39;s
gonna push back on me and I&#39;m gonna move
so that&#39;s what would happen if you threw
a ball on ice but I don&#39;t want to do
that I want to do something else let&#39;s
say that we take these balls and we
throw them down and say these balls are
air this is what a helicopter does it&#39;s
throwing air down and that&#39;s what makes
it stay in the air so there are two ways
that I could do this I could have a
small rotor on my helicopter like you
see there but if I do that I&#39;m gonna
have to throw the air a lot faster in
order to make myself stay up I can have
a bigger helicopter with a bigger rotor
and I can throw more air but not quite
as fast so that you could do it either
way now let&#39;s look at real air there&#39;s
is made up of little particles but let&#39;s
think of it as a volume of air and if I
take that volume of air it&#39;s like a
column and I throw it down that&#39;s what
this helicopter is doing now there&#39;s two
important equations this the important
point is this is just based on drawing
balls down okay so I can say how much
how fast is that air have to go in order
to make the helicopter hover
that&#39;s this one equation up here the
velocity the other one is how much power
does it take to make this helicopter
hover and and that depends on how fast
it&#39;s on the balls and how big the
helicopter is
okay okay what about real helicopters we
can actually look up these things we can
look up how much they weigh how big the
rotors are when we can look up the
powerplant and different helicopters
have different sized rotors and
everything so what if I make up
comparison between the power calculated
for my model and the power that&#39;s
actually listed for these helicopters if
we do that this is what we get so this
is a graph that says I&#39;m going to
compare my model with actual real data
the model may be bogus okay but if it
agrees with data it works so that&#39;s
really important thing about models you
have to check it with real data and see
if it works and this one works so that
means that we can do something with that
model so let&#39;s take that same idea of
throwing balls down and making a
helicopter fly and use it for something
else here you can see two helicopters
the one on the left is a human powered
helicopter okay these things are huge
you can see in the picture it&#39;s got four
rotors and a guy in the middle the
pedals and it it&#39;s just powered only by
a human but the rotors have to be huge
they have to be so big because that
reduces the power that the person needs
to pedal to make it hover this is a real
thing okay and they can&#39;t help them very
long because the guy has to pedal and
using a power about 300 Watts that&#39;s a
lot okay so it&#39;s not a practical thing
but it&#39;s still useful now on the right
we have another flying thing this is the
Helicarrier from shield so it also has
yeah see it&#39;s it&#39;s not real
okay it&#39;s not real yeah I know so the
rotors on there we can look at the size
of those we can look at the weight and
we can find out how fast the air I have
to go down from the Helicarrier and if
you use the same model then you get an
air speed growing down faster than the
speed of sound so that&#39;s not really
realistic but it still works in the
movies
we could do other models too what if I
was trapped in a room with a zombie that
would not be good and and I&#39;d there&#39;s no
doors is there any way I could move
around so that the zombie would never
get me so this is a model of a person
and a zombie trapped in a room yeah I
know you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s crazy but if
you want to model it you can model it so
the zombie here all I have to do is say
there&#39;s some forces pushing the zombie
forward towards a person and something
preventing the zombie from speeding up
forever
and then I can just put the human in
different patterns to see if the zombie
would ever catch it and in this case if
you move in a circle in a room with the
zombie then the zombie could kind of
like orbit around the center and it
never catch you
I mean you eventually you know get
thirsty or have to go the bathroom but
you could survive for a while here&#39;s
another model this is a real picture of
a real comet and you can see the tail
and so we can actually model the
interactions of the dust and the gas
that come off a comet as they interact
with the Sun with some simple models
about light from the Sun and solar
pressure from the Sun and so below that
I have another model a computer model of
the trajectory of a comet and and two
tails and so it&#39;s a very simple model
but you can see that you can get
something that looks like a comet with a
simple model so I&#39;ve shown you a couple
models here and you can see that that&#39;s
how science works making models so now
you can go make your own models thank
you
