whiteflies with the Latin
immediate Abasi are the world&#39;s most
devastating insect pests they have a
global distribution they look alike they
transmit plant viruses and become
insecticide resistant very quickly the
white flies use their stylist or
modified mouthparts to feed on the
leaves of over 600 plants it&#39;s during
this feeding that the whitefly transmits
the virus to the plant much like a
mosquito transmits a malarial parasite
when it feeds on us arguably the most
important of these 600 plants is cassava
as seen here with my friend dr. Donald
catchy Goomba cassava leaves and roots
are eaten by millions of people in South
America Southeast Asia and many
countries in Africa in fact many of you
have even seen or eaten cassava as it
makes up the small balls in bubble tea
and also is the main ingredient in
tapioca pudding but for many in Africa
it&#39;s a staple food in fact 700 million
people rely on cassava for their daily
calories you see cassava is a poverty
fighter if a small-scale family farmer
has healthy cassava they can feed their
family and have enough to sell at market
for important things like school fees
medical expenses and savings but cassava
is under attack in east africa by white
flies these white flies feeding on the
cassava leaves transmit to deadly
viruses cassava mosaic disease and
cassava Brown Street virus the sheer
number of white flies on this plant
coupled with the viruses kill the plant
in addition the cassava roots of
infected plants are inedible due to the
brown rotten tissue in the center that
you see here so I&#39;m using genomics
supercomputing and phylogenetics to
study the speciation of white flies with
the
and goal being to increase cassava
production for small-scale farmers so as
I mentioned before all the whiteflies
look alike so I take DNA from white
flies individual white flies and I feed
them into a gigantic supercomputer this
one is called Magnus and I generate a
phylogenetic tree now these phylogenetic
trees can be interpreted much like
family trees close lines that are
connecting indicate that individuals are
most closely related so I&#39;ve spent the
last eight years described using these
phylogenetic trees to prove that there
are 34 species of immediate abbasi white
flies and not just one as previously
thought so identifying more white flies
means that we need to protect cassava
from more than one enemy and I also use
these phylogenetic trees and white fly
fossil information to study the
evolution of white flies now this is
really complicated I just wanted to
point out that there&#39;s time across the
bottom from past to present and the
blocks in color indicate major
historical events take-home message is
that white flies have been around for a
really long time millions of years so
our solution must take this into account
this speciation information will be
critical when we genetically modify
cassava to be both virus resistant as
you see here and white fly resistant our
team at the University of Western
Australia is really committed to making
all of our DNA data open access in white
fly base and this white fly base will be
crucial for the global community to
study white flies so if we can control
white flies in East Africa small scale
family farmers will have enough cassava
to not only feed their families but sell
at the market and it&#39;s my dream and the
dream of the team who&#39;s working on this
to travel in East Africa very soon and
have cassava be plentiful and the region
food secure for many years to come thank
you
