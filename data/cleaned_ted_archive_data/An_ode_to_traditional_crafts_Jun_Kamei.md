Sam hits the
a really serious problem that I have
every morning when I get in the kitchen
I grab an egg and when the egg that I&#39;m
trying to fry stick on my frying pan
this is crazy
and I think a lot of you agree that this
is a serious issue that has to be
addressed and of course of course of
course a lot of my friends tell me hey
did you know there was a nonstick frying
pan a Teflon frying pan a new one it&#39;s
on the market you could buy one so that
you know you could change the destiny of
your egg of course the testing of my egg
but I know that as a material scientist
there&#39;s a problem here - there&#39;s a
problem because the Teflon coating that
I used to create a nonstick surface get
easily ripped off when you scratch it
and there&#39;s another problem because the
chemical that I used to create the
coatings are actually quite harmful for
your body and for the environment so we
need another solution
I need another solution so as a material
scientists who really think seriously
about his frying egg so I was thinking
of you know going into my list of
chemical and solve this solution but I
couldn&#39;t find one that worked and it was
by coincidence that I found my solution
we have the least accepted in a Japanese
traditional cast-iron pot combined with
oil so a Japanese traditional iron pot
that we call in Japan Nambu tekki
is created with the method that is over
300 years old
and this technique consists of simply
casting an iron that has been melted
into a mold made of sand what is good
with this technique is that it creates
an oxide coating that is strong enough
to be robust against erosion and that
you can actually create this into any
kind of form and to into a frying pan so
I have used this frying pan and I have
tested how nonstick it would be and so
is this is a video that shows it so on
my right is a normal standard frying pan
with oil and my left is a traditional
cast-iron frying pan so you can see that
you know with the stainless one the egg
is sticking this is not good
but for the traditional cast iron it
works and so the result is quite huge
yes as you can see and that this affect
your morning you know attention and
morning tension so we have to think
about that really seriously so let&#39;s go
into the mechanism so for normals for a
normal standard iron pan or stainless i
plan what happen is when you apply oil
on that surface the oil would wet the
surface and this is the oil that would
be really important if you want to
create a surface that does not stick
however the oil layer on that surface
can easily be removed by the water that
are contained in the food so this is a
just an example so the food the water
that come out of the food would remove
the oil layer and because water can
easily be evaporated the food will get
into contact with the stainless surface
it will cause the food to burn and to
stick and this is really different in
the case of the traditional iron pan
because a traditional iron a surface
contain a higher lot of carbon which is
a chemical that goes really well in with
oil and it has microstructure and those
aspects of the cast iron rich in carbon
help contain the oil on the surface even
though the water come out of the food
and eventually no sticking so this is
one example of a technology a material
that has been invented
300 years ago solving my morning problem
and we often see traditional thing as
something beautiful something with
beautiful story but not really useful
but that is a big mistake this is one
example the other example is that we
have in Japan origami which is a
traditional folding techniques and it
has inspired the space scientists to
create solar panels that can fold and
unfold in several seconds so my message
is that we often think of traditional
craft or travel traditional things as
married just beautiful thing but we are
making a big mistake traditional crafts
are full of wisdom a traditional crafts
can inspire us to think of new
technology that can shape our future
thank you very much
