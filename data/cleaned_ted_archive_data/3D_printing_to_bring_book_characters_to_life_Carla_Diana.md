hi everyone when I was a kid this family
was really popular the Jetsons and I
watched a lot of the Jetsons and kids
like me saw this future and felt like
well even though this is fiction that
represents something that we might
really see in our future and for me what
I saw was people living and working
alongside technology like robots in a
way that made everyday life better I
became a product designer and I worked
on things like cell phones and cameras
and vacuum cleaners but my favorite
project was with the Georgia Tech
Georgia Tech socially intelligent
machines lab where I worked on a series
of robots named Simon and curry
this is curry that you see here and the
idea behind these robots is we were
studying how humans might interact with
machines in a really human way so the
robots have light they have sound they
have gestural motions and people can
interact with them using just human
voice and approaching them handing them
objects or even gesturing to the robots
and I just love these projects it was so
exciting to see that people could like
art my team could program the robots to
interact in such a way that they came to
life even though their machines and this
is Andrea Tomas from the socially
intelligent machines lab and when I was
doing this project and just so crazy
about it my colleagues in the product
design world said yeah Carla that&#39;s okay
those are kind of crazy robots though
what do those have to do with what we do
designing products for everyday life and
I said oh my goodness
they have everything to do with that
don&#39;t you see and I could see a vision
really clearly which was that our
everyday objects would essentially
become little robots you see what was
clear was that computing power was
becoming smaller and cheaper as it was
becoming more powerful and communication
protocols like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi were
becoming
are prevalent and this would mean that
our everyday objects would be kind of
like robots so I wrote a piece about it
for the New York Times I have to tell
people how excited I am about this
and as part of the piece there was an
animated slide show I worked with an
artist Katie Turner and illustrated some
of my ideas so this is a robotic lamp
with facial recognition that can chase
you around if you don&#39;t wake up early
enough this is a bicycle that&#39;s
connected to GPS and the handlebars
vibrate to let you know which way to
turn and the jacket can light up to let
drivers know where you&#39;re going and this
is a connected bathroom so you step on
the tiles it measures your weight you
look in the mirror and it can read your
skin color and tell your heart rate and
all of that can be tracked and sent to
the cloud so that you and your doctor
can know what&#39;s going on and these are
just you know fantasy projects that
existed as concepts a few years ago and
now are all in development in one way or
another and even in my career I&#39;ve
gotten to work on some things like this
for example at the firm smart design I
worked on a series of connected
appliances a washing machine that can
text you and let you know what&#39;s
happening with your clothing washer and
dryer can go online they can know the
utility rates so that they run at the
most efficient time this is a pregnancy
monitor I worked on with a firm in
Barcelona called zinc and it could let a
woman know what&#39;s happening inside her
belly when she&#39;s pregnant and contract
contractions and also send that
information to a doctor and I even got
to work on a robot so when I was at
smart design I worked with a firm called
neato robotics and I got to apply some
of what I had learned working on robots
like Simon and curry at Georgia Tech so
I made sure that this robot was as
expressive as it could be so that we
took took advantage of its movements we
took a lot a look at the lights that it
made and also paid attention to the
sounds so the sounds are like a little
language so here&#39;s the robot when it
wakes up
and here&#39;s when it says oh hello here&#39;s
what happens when something goes wrong
it&#39;s trapped under the couch and here&#39;s
it going back to sleep so one thing that
I&#39;ve learned is if you&#39;re going to
invent things for the future it&#39;s very
important to have your hands on the
technology to understand it intuitively
so I created a lab within the firm smart
designs called the smart interaction lab
and the point is to tinker and create
imaginary products so one of the things
that we created was the apron that
tweets we call it apron alert so there&#39;s
a clasp when you close the clasp it
sends a tweet so that people know that
cooking is started and then when you
open the clasp it lets people know that
the food is ready so you can come to the
table another project we worked on is
called what&#39;s up smart and it&#39;s a
desktop beacon so you can turn it and
change the color of the light to let
people know your status you can let them
know I&#39;m really busy don&#39;t talk to me or
I&#39;m open for brainstorming or I&#39;m taking
a break or I&#39;m out of the office and it
also updates that status online so that
people in other offices can know what&#39;s
happening and then one thing I was very
very fascinated with was 3d printing
robots and one thing that we call
distributed design or you saw a little
bit about this with denieth stalk and so
I really wanted to do a designer&#39;s
project about this so I created a story
and did a children&#39;s book the book is
called Leo the maker prints and it&#39;s
about a young woman and her robot friend
who happens to be a 3d printing robot
and all of the objects that are part of
the story can be downloaded and printed
so here you see the sheep and here&#39;s
some of the characters and musical
instruments some of the things that are
in the book foreshadow what&#39;s happening
with our future of 3d printing so there
is a robot that can scan your
and make a custom-made sandal that fits
you perfectly and lets you leave the
perfect footprint so everyone knows
where you&#39;re going there&#39;s also a micro
factory so there&#39;s a jewelry designer
who makes jewelry with math that can be
distributed in small quantities and
there is a robot that makes architecture
for hamsters it&#39;s been very exciting
these projects have been downloaded all
over the world in Shanghai in Tokyo in
the Netherlands and it&#39;s gotten me to
explore not only the machines in front
of me but manufacturing processes and
product distribution well what I wanted
to leave you with today is that the
future that is just a fantasy right now
is going to be your invention playground
when you grow up so have fun
that was just incredible um can I ask
you a question
sure so the young you who watched the
Jetsons what would you tell her about
the future and the present well I would
say young Carla a lot of these things
are going to really happen for example
robots you&#39;re gonna see a lot of them
some of them maybe not are going to are
not going to happen so flying cars maybe
not so much people still have to learn
to drive in two dimensions and we&#39;re
kind of still messing that up okay thank
you thank you
[Applause]
