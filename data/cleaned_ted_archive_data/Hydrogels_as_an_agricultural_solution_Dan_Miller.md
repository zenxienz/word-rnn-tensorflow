hello I&#39;m going to talk to you today
about hydrogels but before I begin I&#39;d
like to start a little experiment I&#39;m
going to put some water in this Cup look
and I&#39;m going to put in a few pinches of
hydrogel which looks and feels a bit
like sugar okay stir it up and we&#39;ll
come back to this later the reason I&#39;m
talking to about hydrogels is because
the world faces a food crisis look a
growing population means more mouths to
feed
climate change is causing massive
droughts and it&#39;s expected to get much
worse topsoil erosion makes it harder to
grow food and food scarcity leads to
high prices which leads to social and
risk as we saw recently with the Arab
Spring and that leads us to hydrogels
which were developed in the 1960s by the
United States Department of Agriculture
technically hydrogels are cross-linked
hydrophilic polymers or polymers that
can are really good at holding onto
water molecules more practically there
are super absorbent material that can
hold hundreds of times its weight in
water you can think of them as little
tiny super sponges the goal of the USDA
and developing hydrogels was to help
farmers grow more food with less water
but it didn&#39;t work out that way
because there were some problems turns
out that the hydrogels they developed
were toxic when they broke down in the
soil they were expensive and they didn&#39;t
last very long but they did find some
applications for this new material the
first uses were sanitary napkins and
disposable diapers they also came up
with many other applications including
flexible contact lenses other biomedical
applications and it was even used
and is used on a small scale in some
gardens but large scale agriculture
remains elusive then in 2008 dr. nayoung
Lee came up with a new formulation for
hydrogels and this new formulation was
inexpensive non-toxic in fact has been
certified by the EPA last for dozens of
rain or water cycles and is easy to
apply you put it in the soil at the same
time that you apply seed or fertilizer
he helped form a company called M Oasis
and the company began working with UC
Davis and Cal State Fresno to perform
field trials on a variety of crops in
California and here&#39;s a sample of the
results they obtained for broccoli the
hydrogel treated side you&#39;ll did 34
percent more broccoli using 25 percent
less water compared to the broccoli
crops that didn&#39;t use hi Jo for lettuce
the hydrogel treated side used
seventy-six yielded 76% more lettuce
when irrigated fully and for tomatoes
the hydrogel treated side crops use
yielded 45 percent more tomatoes using
25 percent less water and yielded about
the same amount of tomatoes compared to
the control crop when irrigated with 50
percent less water so why do hydrogels
help grow more food with less water
let&#39;s start with two seeds and let&#39;s put
hydrogel on one side now will irrigate
both sides and in sandy soil much of the
water runs down past the plant and into
the ground below
but hydrogels capture the water and
fertilizer and hold it near the plant
this allows the plant to grow more
steadily to allow continued growth the
non hydrogel treated the non hydrogel
side needs to be irrigated more often
the amount of hydrogel needed is quite
small only about 10 kilograms or about
20 pounds per acre and the cost of the
hydrogel is low compared to the
increased value of the crop and the
water savings other benefits of hydrogel
include it helps reduce topsoil erosion
and it allows farmers to use less
fertilizer so what&#39;s next for the
company they&#39;re exploring field trial
opportunities and other water-stressed
countries they&#39;ve begun pilot deployment
with commercial farmers in California
and they plan full-scale deployment in
2014 let&#39;s see how our experiments doing
here so the water has turned to gel yeah
so with this breakthrough it means that
hydrogels can finally go from diapers to
helping put food on dinner tables around
the world thank you
