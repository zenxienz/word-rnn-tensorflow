so you know when you&#39;re in a meeting and
your coworkers come in and they just saw
your boss make it at the gym
is it big no dude it&#39;s like this draw it
on the board
no nobody okay none of you guys none of
you guys are American sitcom writers
this is the stuff we talk about penises
and ideas how do we come up with our
ideas well my last TV network had a
formula heart plus bark equals arc now
come on is going to change your life I
want to tell you the things that I
learned in the sitcom writers room first
a bit about how the room works every
sitcom universe scene was written about
about ten people around a conference
table on this one show we worked through
lunch and dinner and breakfast we
ordered so frequently from one
restaurant they sent over a massive pan

of tiramisu at 11:00 p.m. there was
still so much of it left we dared a
junior writer Tim to eat it in an hour
for cash five minutes in he turned gray
towards the end he started vomiting back
into the pan and there was a
surprisingly heated debate over whether
the pan had to be totally empty in order
for him to collect we signed off on it
he bolted the bathroom and as his
gagging echoed down the hallway there
was like this love glow in the writers
room we were on this United hi
[Music]
himnow run TV shows and I wonder would
he still choke down dessert for cash
maybe the wandering led me to my first
lesson if you haven&#39;t worked with
someone in over five years have you
really worked with them before you talk
about someone think of your view of them
is current our impressions of people can
get frozen in time with people change
it&#39;s not just kids who go through
five-inch growth spurts and thanks to a
pan of tiramisu I like to think we all
grew that day second story another show
I worked with a guy who was a former
actor who used to play Kenickie in a
production of grease so of course we
asked him to sing grease lightning and
of course he refused next to him set
Maggie my hero
that season while we worked 18-hour days
she went through cancer she wrote
another project that the network
rejected and her husband left her
throughout the whole thing she was
amazing she made us laugh every single
day she brought it she was professional
so professional the Kenickie sitting
right next to her missed the part about
her husband leaving so when she went to
loan her car with co-worker he was
confused well why isn&#39;t your husband
driving it well when&#39;s he coming back we
begged him with our eyes to stop and
finally he realized oh my god Maggie I&#39;m
so sorry Maggie took the perfect pause
and said you know what make me feel
better
we knew instantly your Niki jumped up on
the table go greased lightning you&#39;re
burning up the Carter mouth and this is
a greased lightning go greased lightning
it was maybe my favorite thing ever in a
writers room and it happened because
Maggie hung in there she could spot the
opportunity and that was transformative
which leads me to my second lesson we
can only be embarrassed if we agree to
be Maggie not only didn&#39;t cry she got a
huge laugh laughing connects us to each
other it gives us something to hold on
to it means we&#39;re not alone which leads
me to the third and final lesson being
able to make people laugh must be what
it feels like to have penis
[Applause]
it connects you to the most intimate
part of another person it can get you
into and out of outrageous situations
and I might lose some of you here like
half the crowd but being able to make
someone laugh might be better than
having a penis
it&#39;s a superpower we all have and it
gets better with age
[Applause]
