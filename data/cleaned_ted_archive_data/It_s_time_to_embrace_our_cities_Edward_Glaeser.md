I am so incredibly happy that Ted is
decided to celebrate the city and I am
so deeply honored that I&#39;ve been allowed
to be part of it I&#39;d like to start with
a picture of America and I&#39;d call this a
picture to make it clear from the front
that I have no aesthetic sensibility
whatsoever indeed I really did think I&#39;m
wearing business casual but in fact this
is a picture of America what I&#39;ve done
is I&#39;ve taken the 3,000 odd counties in
the United States and I split them into
tents and I&#39;ve ordered them from the
most dense to the least dense counties
because at their heart cities are the
absence of physical space between people
cities are proximity their closeness
their density and what the bottom line
shows is the relationship between income
levels and density across America the
most dense tent of America&#39;s counties
have income levels that are fifty
percent higher than the least dense half
of America&#39;s counties this is a common
factor out the world that urbanization
is associated with prosperity and indeed
the three largest metropolitan areas in
the United States produce eighteen
percent of our country&#39;s GDP while
including only thirteen percent of our
country&#39;s population the top line shows
us somewhat more surprising fact where
it shows the relationship between
initial levels of density level and
subsequent population growth over the
last ten years and what you see is that
the denser the initial the county was
initially the faster the subsequent
population growth has been in the 19th
century we left our our enclaves on the
eastern seaboard to populate the empty
spaces in the American hinterland but in
the 21st century we&#39;re moving closer
together we&#39;re trying to be near one
another we&#39;re taking advantage of the
tremendous advantages but being close to
other human beings have now the success
of cities in the developing world dwarf
anything that&#39;s going on in the
developed world we&#39;ve just recently
passed this amazing halfway point where
more than half of humanity now lives in
cities and it&#39;s hard not to think that
that&#39;s a fundamentally good thing
because when you compare those countries
that are more than fifty percent
urbanized to those countries that are
less than fifty percent urbanized you
see that the more urban countries have
incomes that are on average five times
higher an infant mortality
levels that are less than a third gandi
gandi famously said that the future of
India was in its villages rather than in
cities but with all due respect the
great man was deeply wrong the future of
India is very much in its cities in
places like mumbai and kolkata and
Gurgaon and Bangalore which have brought
Indians together connecting them with
themselves with the outside world
creating pathways out of poverty into
into prosperity now this rosy view of
cities is so different from the New York
of my childhood when it seemed like not
just President Ford but heck history
itself was telling New York to drop dead
the top image shows Jimmy Carter
wandering through the wasteland at the
South Bronx to become it really seemed
possible that all of America&#39;s older
cities would revert back to some planet
of the apes like wielder Latin
wilderness that could take over once
urban spaces this wasn&#39;t just an issue
of New York or Chicago in 1971 two
jokers put up a sign asking the last
person to leave Seattle to please turn
off the lights in the city because
Boeing was cutting back on its jobs and
no one could imagine a how Seattle would
recover after bowing reducing its
employment now in some sense the 70&#39;s
look so bleak because it looked as if
cities had lost their entire economic
reason for being if you think about why
cities formed in the u.s. they were part
of solving a transportation problem at
the start of our country&#39;s history we
perched on the edge of a tremendously
wealthy continent but was fundamentally
unable to access that countenance well
it cost as much in 1816 to ship goods 30
miles over land as it did to ship them
across the Atlantic it was that
inaccessible to get in into America and
over the course of the 19th century we
dug canals we build railroads and cities
formed up as nodes on this great
transportation network at pinch points
Chicago the linchpin of a great watery
arc that went all the way from New York
to New Orleans a city where industry
came to be around transportation where
are
invented the refrigerated rail car which
enabled Iowa fed beef to be slaughtered
in Chicago and shipped to markets in the
East but the amazing thing about cities
is even when they form the most prosaic
reason like armored stockyards miracles
happen when smart people connect and are
able to learn from each other cities
have been producing chains of
collaborative creativity since Plato and
Socrates vicco bickered on an Athenian
street corner and so it was in Chicago
in the 1880s when a chained a brilliant
architect will produce the skyscraper
and so it wasn&#39;t Detroit in the 1890s
when a cluster of entrepreneurial genius
just as collaborative just as
competitive as Silicon Valley in the
1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s gave us the
mass-produced car the great tragedy of
Detroit is that while their invention
vast vertically integrated factories
producing black model T after black
model T while this invention was
incredibly productive in the short run
it was a terrible model for urban
reinvention because factories always
move to places where costs are lowest
and as those transportation costs
dropped it was no longer necessary to
what the factories on the Great Lakes it
was no longer necessary to put
production near this coal mines and so
indiscreet led it moved to low-cost
areas in the United States and it went
across the oceans and it looked as if
our cities were doomed now one of the
effects of declining transportation
costs is that people were free to move
to places that they wanted to live and
this was the rise of cities like Los
Angeles that excelled because of the
lifestyle that they offered and it
appeared that the thing that Americans
really wanted in terms of lifestyle
above all was warm winters because
there&#39;s no variable that better predicts
metropolitan area growth during the 20th
century than January temperatures now
older cities were of course hit by the
move despot fun but they were also hit
by the move to sprawl which is
fundamentally reinventing our spaces
around the car some of this reinvention
was natural the average can you buy car
in this country is 24 minutes the
average commute by public transit is 48
minutes but it was also helped by
massive federal investment in the
highway system the work of the economist
Nathaniel bounce snow at Brown finds of
each new highway
that cut into an urban core reduced the
central city&#39;s population by about
eighteen percent relative to the rest of
the metropolitan area and of course the
federal government didn&#39;t exactly help
they followed a Potemkin village
strategy that confused structures and
infrastructure for the real heart of the
city which is always the people living
in the city it gave cities urban renewal
building houses in places that had no
need for new houses putting up a
monorail in Detroit this is a city that
was built for 1.85 million people it now
has less than half of it the streets are
easy to drive along it didn&#39;t need a
monorail like some old simpsons episode
what it did need was investment in
people for in fact the variable that
explains which older colder cities can&#39;t
come came back is human capital is
education if the share of the population
with a college degree of 19 40 or 19
six-year in 1970 this shows the
relationship over the past decade across
all counties between skills and and
population growth as the share of the
population with a college degree in a
metropolitan area goes up by ten percent
per capita GDP goes up on average by
about eleven thousand dollars and
holding your years of schooling constant
you should expect your wages to go up by
about eight percent as the share of
adults with a college degree in your
metropolitan area goes up by ten percent
now the importance of skills in
explaining urban resurgence helps make
sensitive great paradox we live in an
age in which it is effortless to
telecommute across the planet in which
we could all dial it in from whatever
Sylvan spot appeals to our by Ophelia
and forego all the inconveniences to
come with city life but in so many ways
in so many places we still choose to be
around other people we still choose
cities now there&#39;s a reason for this new
technologies and globalization are not
enemies of the city they are its friends
and the reason for this is that new
technologies and globalization have
increased the returns to being smart and
we are fundamentally a social species
that gets smart by being around other
smart people we come out of the womb
with this remarkable ability to soak up
information from our parents from our
peers from our siblings even
occasionally from our teachers the
city&#39;s play to that advantage and as the
world has gotten more complex the need
for the face-to-face contact that
enables us to communicate
most complicated ideas becomes even more
critical anyone who has ever taught
knows the hard part of teaching is not
knowing your script it&#39;s understanding
whether or not anything that you&#39;re
saying is getting through and we have
evolved in a way over millions of years
have these marvelous cues for
communicating comprehension or confusion
that are lost when we&#39;re not in the same
room cities unable the haphazard
learning that occurs when young people
come to too smart places and
entrepreneurial places that&#39;s why all
those Harvard graduates want to come and
live in Silicon Valley because you can&#39;t
learn to be a software entrepreneur by
just reading Wikipedia you need to be
there you need to see the mistakes and
failures of people around you and indeed
as important as formal education is
certainly the most important things that
cities produce our entrepreneurial
talent and measures of entrepreneurship
which are crappy which are awful to a
skill a remarkable job of predicting
employment growth this is average firms
time and in 1977 and subsequent
employment growth places with big firms
are typically thought to be
significantly less entrepreneurial and
lo and behold they grow at far lower
rates small firms smart people and
connections to the outside world these
are the keys to urban success in the
world today now the most entrepreneurial
place I&#39;ve ever been in the world is the
darabi of slum in mumbai you go in in
one shop and there&#39;s some guys or
recycling paper boxes that means cutting
them open to turning them around so
someone&#39;s don&#39;t through see the labels
and then there there are people showing
bras and you feel like you&#39;re in the
lower east side of manhattan in 1904 and
then there are people recycling plastic
syringes and someone making these
beautifully intricate plots and you just
marvel at the creativity and the energy
of Indian entrepreneurship and then you
go outside you see a kid defecating in
an unpaved street and you also marvel at
the public failures of of India for
indeed Mumbai should never apologize for
its poverty cities are full of poor
people not because they make people poor
but because they attract for people with
economic opportunity with a better
social safety net in the US for the
ability to get around without a car for
the adult but they should apologize that
they&#39;re unable to deal with the
downsides of density before if two
people are close enough to give each
other an idea face-to-face they&#39;re also
close enough to exchange a contagious
disease and cities have been battling
these downside since the beginning of
time this is the pass rate of death
rates in New York
in 1900 boy born in New York City could
expect it was seven years less than the
national average today life expectancies
are three years longer or so in New York
than the rest of the nation no one&#39;s
exactly sure why that&#39;s true among older
people some people credit walking a
better social connection among younger
people is quite clear people in cities
are much less likely to die from motor
vehicle accidents in suicide both of
which are leading causes of death among
the young but the health of cities did
not happen by accident in quite
tremendous investments America&#39;s cities
and towns were spending as much on water
at the start of the 20th century as the
federal government was spending on
everything except for the post office in
the Army and these investments need to
be made in the developing world today
some problems like congestion need more
than just an engineering solution we
can&#39;t just build our way out of traffic
congestion there&#39;s something called the
fundamental law vehicle vehicle traffic
which dad said as vehicle miles built
goes up vehicle miles traveled increase
roughly 14 1 if you build it they will
drive you need to do what singapore does
here you have a second dentist country
in the world it has roads that move
swiftly because it charges people for
the congestion that they cause when i
take to the roads when cities are able
to deal with a crime with a congestion
with a contagious disease they can be
marvelous places of pleasure as well as
productivity the same urban innovation
and entrepreneurship that make cities
productive also makes them fun also make
for great restaurants in the great scale
of cities enables them to have great
places pleasures that have covered a
fixed cost involved in a in a great
museum or or the Globe Theatre where
Shakespeare plays were performed now one
of the challenges of successful cities
is if the city is exceeding both of the
place of pleasure and productivity but
it doesn&#39;t build enough housing then it
can become a boutique town affordable
only to the wealthy and this is where
the great urban economists my my admire
so much made her one error she looked at
old building two new buildings notice
that old buildings were cheap and new
buildings were expensive and that letter
to think that the way to keep the city&#39;s
affordable was to make sure that no one
built any new buildings on top of old
Billings that&#39;s not how supply and
demand works you need to actually build
more and more housing into actual expect
cities to remain affordable and her own
home area Greenwich Village which
evolved from being an affordable place
to a place where hedge fund managers
only need apply for townhouses is a
living proof of that I want to end with
a story about Henry a young carpet
graduate who
when a beautiful spring day in 1844 went
for a walk in the woods outside of
outside of Concord and he went to you
did a little fishing and the fishing was
good because there hadn&#39;t been much rain
lately but when he came to cook the fish
into a chowder who wins flicked the
flames to nearby dry grass and a fire
started and it spread by the time it was
done it had burned up more than 300
acres of prime woodland in his own day
this young man was castigated in the
enemy of the environment the concert
freeman called him a flibbertigibbet
which I think was pretty bad for 1844
and indeed they were surely right it&#39;s
hard to think of any young men in
Cambridge or Boston he did as much
damage to the environment at this send
it today of course he is revered as a
secular state of American
environmentalism he is Henry David
Thoreau whose book Walden seems to
preach a gospel of what a wonderful
thing it is deliver on nature but of
course his own life seems to tell it
different moral his own life tells the
story of how destructive we are as a
species and that in fact Henry David
Thoreau would have been a lot more good
for nature if you had stayed at home in
Cambridge instead of going out into the
woods outside of Concord and it&#39;s the
general fact about cities this is from
the work that I&#39;ve done with Matthew
Khan that&#39;s about looking at carbon
emissions associated with living in
different parts of the world and we tend
to find that people who live in cities
because they drive lessons with a
smaller home even holding income and
family size constant you as much less
less energy if the great growing
economies of Indian China see their
carbon emissions rise to level seen in
the sprawling United States global
carbon emissions go up by a hundred and
thirty percent if they stop at the level
seen in hyper dense Hong Kong global
carbon emissions go up by thirty percent
and that&#39;s one final reason why America
should embrace its cities and by the
world should embrace in cities and why
America should rethink those policies
like our subsidization of highways like
our home mortgage interest deduction
that bribes Americans to leave servants
and move into suburban homes and most of
all to rethink our urban school system
that does so much to discourage parents
from living in in urban areas thank you
very much
first of all first of all
congratulations on possibly the fastest
head towards every game so to summarize
five words the reason the world needs
cities now how would you rank it in in
the five key words cities and Kneedler
to connect and create collaboratively
what earlier in this conference says we
had a whole thing earlier on climate
change sustainability is that you know
that that&#39;s that issue about what
whether humanity can find a way of
reducing our carbon output cities have a
role to play in that absolutely right by
building up we don&#39;t filled out and I
think the evidence on carbon emissions
within the US and elsewhere really shows
that when we live close together we
drive less we tend to use smaller living
spaces which emit less energy and all of
these things mean that cities are not
the enemy of the environment they&#39;re the
friend of the environment the things
which actually promote a more
sustainable future I find your book
incredibly revealing and actually quite
inspiring so thank you for thank you so
much and coming here much for hanging
here dude
