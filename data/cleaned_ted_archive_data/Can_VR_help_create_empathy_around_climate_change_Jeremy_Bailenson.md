for almost 20 years I have built and
tested the effects of on people of
immersive virtual reality what is this
woman doing she sees the world just like
we do there is a floor that she feels
she walks around she hears sounds she
feels virtual touch but in her version
of the world there&#39;s a chasm it&#39;s ten
meters deep and we put a very rickety
plank over it her task is to tiptoe
across that plank now if she steps off
in her mind she actually falls down when
virtual reality has done well it&#39;s an
actual experience the brain treats it as
real we call this presence in my lab
about a third of the people who I bring
in and I bring in about a thousand
people per year they refuse to step off
that plank the ones that do they shriek
they sweat and sometimes they fall into
my arms
that&#39;s why Cody is there spotting that
woman because people actually fall down
it&#39;s that persuasive we&#39;re at a tipping
point in the history of this technology
on the left you can see the head mounted
display that I was using up until 2014
it literally cost more than my car on
the right you can see what we&#39;re using
now it cost less than the price of a
video game it&#39;s going to be in living
rooms everywhere this holiday season the
smart money the big money is betting
that video games are going to be the
killer app and I mean the killer app in
my lab for the last 20 years we&#39;ve been
developing non-lethal applications of
virtual reality
[Applause]
we&#39;ve run hundreds of experiments that
show that a virtual reality experience
is profound it changes the way you think
of yourself it changes the way you
behave that changes the way that you
think about others one of these areas is
conservation so everybody in this room
we want to be green we want to conserve
but it turns out it&#39;s really hard to do
this every day behaviors are hard to
change
that&#39;s where virtual reality comes in
the New York Times read an article about
toilet paper it turns out that soft
fluffy toilet paper that we all love
it comes from non recycled paper if
you&#39;re using that soft fluffy toilet
paper you are cutting down trees you&#39;re
leading to deforestation so this article
comes out in the New York Times but it
doesn&#39;t change anything
despite being written so brilliantly so
I live with the hippies in Northern
California
it&#39;s a crunchiest place on the planet
but when I go into the supermarket I
can&#39;t find recycle toilet paper so how
do you actually change behavior we ran
an experiment where subjects came to the
lab they put on the helmet
they had a haptic device that shook
their hands like a chainsaw and we
forced them to cut down trees the trees
crash through the floor banged their
feet up it feels very real in fact
people that go through this they say to
me Jeremy every time I go through that
toilet paper aisle I think of you
and I&#39;m okay with it in our experiments
we had three groups one group cut down a
tree in virtual reality
the second group saw video of a tree
being cut down and the third group read
it beautifully written narrative of what
we&#39;d like to cut down a tree all three
groups said after this treatment that
they wanted to use less paper but we
followed their behavior after the study
and only the virtual reality group
changed they use 20% less paper than the
rest of the groups so virtual reality
provides the best of both worlds the
brain treats it is real but we don&#39;t
actually have to kill trees to teach you
conservation many of you guys have been
Italy some of you have actually been to
the island of Ischia off the coast of
Italy some of you might have gone to
this beautiful castle on your
sightseeing journey my adventure to say
that none of you have scuba dived to see
the underwater volcanic vents on this
rocky reef
why does 1/3 of the United States 1/3 of
the people in the United States not
believe that climate change poses a
serious threat whereas almost all
science whereas almost all scientists do
if I could bring the world everybody in
this country to this particular reef and
show them these volcanic vents I could
change minds about climate change when
people experience something directly
they see it in a different light this
quote is from dr. Jane Lubchenco who was
the head of the National Oceanic
Atmospheric associate administration
under President Obama for four years dr.
Lubchenco witnessed more natural
disasters in her four-year term than in
any four-year term in US history
she had a heartbreaking job her job is
to go and visit these sites and help
victims of natural disasters for example
hurricane san
what dr. Lubchenco learned is that
experience Trump&#39;s skepticism doesn&#39;t
matter what your politics are if a
natural disaster destroys your hometown
you believe in climate change in virtual
reality disasters free I hit a button it
happens and nobody gets hurt so let&#39;s go
back to Ischia these volcanic vents spew
pure carbon dioxide this is very special
because typically when there&#39;s volcanic
vents they also have some toxic chemical
for example sulfur these guys are pure
carbon dioxide so they show us the
future of all of the oceans in the world
it turns out that 20% of human produced
carbon dioxide gets absorbed by the
oceans so think of this special tiny
vent off the island of Ischia as the
canary in the coalmine
this is warning us of danger to come
when carbon dioxide hits the ocean a
chemical reaction occurs where the water
becomes more acidic when the water
becomes more acidic the coral and other
life-forms have struggled to find food
struggle to fortify their cells and they
died in the past two centuries our
oceans have increased in acidity a
staggering 25% in the last two centuries
and this rate is accelerating so what&#39;s
going to happen to all the life in the
ocean at this point I&#39;d like to
introduce my marine science colleagues
Theo Micheli and Christie croaker they
have been using this reef as a crystal
ball for the last decade to see how
ocean acidification human product
produced carbon dioxide is going to
change all of our oceans here you can
see them scuba diving doing a species
count to understand how it will affect
life in the ocean here are two zones on
their reef on the left is the healthy
reef it has a normal ocean chemistry you
can see the white coral there you can
see the red coral there you can see lots
of life diversity
on the right is an area of the reef
that&#39;s closer to these volcanic vents
this area simulates how all of our
oceans will look by the year 2100
eighty-five years from now this is how
all of our oceans will look notice
there&#39;s no coral and notice how algae
has completely taken over the scene and
stifled the rest of the life that&#39;s
there
carbon dioxide production is going to
devastate the ocean scientists know this
they publish these finding in the top
journal on the planet but humans don&#39;t
in this room most people have not heard
of ocean acidification why not and the
answer is because you don&#39;t have a
direct experience
I can&#39;t bring all of you to iskut but I
can bring Ischia to you would you guys
like to go on a field trip all right who
wants to go ah I love field trips and I
love bringing my little field trip pack
of technology like I always do in every
field trip ever all right all right I&#39;m
gonna put on this
all right I&#39;m going in
I&#39;m in I seem that stop time okay
fishies yes just keep swimming
this is great I said coral I see eels
it&#39;s really blue and lovely now things
are changing and see bubbles of doom
killing everything around me it&#39;s now
it&#39;s all brown and sad yeah okay so that
was that was bad
I don&#39;t want bubbles of doom can I make
it stop welcome back thank you welcome
back
welcome home Thank You Isaac
so my colleague Roy P who&#39;s a pioneering
educational technologist and I for the
last few years have been building a
field trip it&#39;s a 15 minute journey
where you go and visit Ischia you do
scavenger hunts to see how the species
have changed you fast forward in time to
see the future and come back and we use
a technique called body transfer
developed by neuroscientist where you
literally become an animal on the reef
and you feel the devastation happened
firsthand to you we&#39;ve taken this
simulation for the last few years we&#39;ve
tested it in classrooms at Stanford we
brought it to high schools for field
testing we brought it to festivals for
informal learning sessions at Museum it
works but what do we know about digital
stuff Stanford scientists have spent
thousands of hours on this field trip we
spent a lot of time on this but the next
billion copies are free when I was a kid
my parents bought me an Atari 2600 okay
it came with a free game called pong
I work in Silicon Valley and I have the
luxury of talking to the people at all
the big tech companies it turns out that
Google and Facebook and Samsung and Sony
and HTC are all in an arms race to put
this technology in your living room this
holiday season it is coming the question
is what freebie is going to come with
their system as of three days ago I have
a handshake that says that virtual
Ischia is going to be delivered for free
with at least one of these systems
[Applause]
yeah it&#39;s great it&#39;s really neat but
it&#39;s not just ocean acidification we
have to worry about with the environment
we&#39;re also doing research to teach
people about water conservation we&#39;re
also building better communication
systems where I can feel like I&#39;m in the
room with you in virtual reality so we
can eliminate unnecessary travel and
save fossil fuel virtual reality is
coming like a freight train it&#39;s going
to be in your living room this holiday
season in fact the New York Times is -
is delivering millions of them
this Sunday if you subscribe to the
paper it&#39;s coming it&#39;s up to us to use
it for good thank you
[Applause]
