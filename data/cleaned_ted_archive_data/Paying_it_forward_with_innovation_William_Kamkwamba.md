thank you
so I for for my fist like took in the UM
in Tanzania I definitely like this like
some part that I leave I didn&#39;t I had
one or the part because at that time I
couldn&#39;t really like speak English
because I was six years out of school
and the what I do know that when I was
growing up in Mara we experienced famine
which made my parents not refer to a pay
for my school fees but I didn&#39;t want
love to I really loved the school so
during that time when I had to drop out
of school I did love the school and when
I spoke at the Ted stage in a Lucia a
lot of who Teddy stars volunteered to
support me to get my schooling back on
track so I went to school in South
Africa at African - patata me for three
years it was hard but I I made it after
that with my friend Brian we published
the book during my book tour also became
a college tour one of the college in New
England encouraged me to apply and my
currently a student there it&#39;s really a
miracle so my first year was real
challenging but I knew that I could make
it because other people have done it
before
so like enough my tutors and also my
teachers couldn&#39;t give up on me I was
finally by mid sophomore year I finally
caught up with my friends I have
wonderful friends ila I love like campus
campus life although I&#39;m not very good
fan of the quad every summer I try to go
back to Malawi to improve the life of
the people and also to improve my
community one of the project that I did
was to build the private school that I
went to
the schools built 16 years ago with a
capacitor funded a student right now
they&#39;re once on the funded student in
learn in this school so we installed
solar panels at the school so that the
student they&#39;re going to be able to
study later on at night and also there&#39;s
some discs even better with ps1 you have
also added tinsel and the new books at
the library where faithlyn about
windmill we share some of the books to
the other libraries in the nearby so
even the the school that resented me
kicking me out with in the instead of
least sending the school that kicked me
out when my parents couldn&#39;t afford me
and my friend who in story swap panels
and also install computers that allow
student to to study we use offline
internet using it greenery which has all
the information that they need for their
studying and rain now most attendance
has doubled because of that student
they&#39;re going to be able to access some
information we can update once in a
while I also study the saga team so that
some guys in my community they can be
able to have something to do if it
brings the community together and women
brings vegetables to say I bring snacks
to say at the game to end some money we
also installed solar water pumps so that
women can be able to get water it&#39;s the
only running water in the along the area
the women they don&#39;t have to travel long
distances at school I studied two
businesses one of the business it&#39;s
mesme which grant called for women&#39;s
women&#39;s in the village Grandia corn and
they they draft the business is run by
my Palance the other business is like a
minivan transport transportation
business I ordered this van over the
internet from my dorm room I ordered it
from Japan and get it shipped to
Tanzania
and I went there
picked up with my with my father so
every time when I go back home I try to
wake her to share some of my skills that
I have with the people in my community
so that they can be able to do their own
project one of the project that I do is
to teach them how to fix water pumps and
also how to maintain so they got to be
able to to take care of their own like a
destiny back to school 11 weeks and
seven seven years and today&#39;s from my
first time on stage stage Teddy stage
with the with Chris I&#39;m real happy to
share with you that I&#39;ll be graduating
from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire
what next a lot of people ask me what
would be next next I want to intern in a
design firm so that I can be able to
learn about design so that in the next
CR six months then I can be able to go
back to Malawi to awaken the project
where to promote about water and also
energy project but that&#39;s what I&#39;m
hoping to do next
although this couldn&#39;t have been
possible without the support and
engagement that I got from the tape all
the people that supported me from the
beginning until now I say like thank you
to all it is very great honour for me to
be here thank you
