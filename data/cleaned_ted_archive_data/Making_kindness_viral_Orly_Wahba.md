I&#39;m filled with a great sense of
gratitude happiness and purpose as I
stand here today but more than anything
a great responsibility to deliver a
message a dream that I held in my heart
since childhood I&#39;m not gonna speak to
you today about something new or an
unheard of yet at the same time it has
the ability the energy and the power to
change and to transform this world
the power of kindness the magic of
kindness the magic of people some people
call me a dreamer but I mean aren&#39;t we
all dreamers but even dreams need to be
put into action I became a middle school
teacher because I wanted to make a
difference in the lives of my students
at a time when it mattered most when
their self value and their self-worth
was being challenged every day I just
wanted to help them open their eyes to
see the beauty in the world the beauty
and others and more importantly the
beauty in themselves help them recognize
that who they are what they do matters
so I started a project acts of kindness
cards each card with a different act of
kindness with really simple instructions
perform the contact then pass the card
to someone else to keep the kindness
going why cards because kindness as a
term could sometimes be so broad and I
wanted to be able to bring it down to
their level make it more specific show
them that it could be something as small
as opening the door for someone or
inviting someone to sit at lunch with
you to show them that one act can have a
profound impact and help them see all
the amazing opportunities that are there
all the time so what happened I mean
their self value increased tremendously
they started feeling powerful and they
started getting excited about different
acts of kindness that they would see
they began to see the ripple effect of
- and that kindness is infectious and to
them that was the coolest thing ever but
the truth is I didn&#39;t realize the
potential of these cards until one day I
was coming home from school and it was
really hot and there were these
community service workers on the street
so I ran in my house and I got a bunch
of drinks and I brought it out to them
they were so grateful so shocked but he
was so grateful and I having to go into
my pocket and I had in my pocket eight
acts of kindness cards and right there
eight community service workers and so I
gave each and every one of them a card
and one of the guys approached me with
tears in his eyes and he grabbed on to
his card and he started screaming how
did you know to give me this card how
did you know to give me this card for
the past couple weeks have been thinking
about calling my parents it&#39;s been ten
years since I&#39;ve spoken to them and on
my card it says call your mother and
father to tell him how much you love
them how is it that was all he needed a
reminder of push in the right direction
something too shown that you know this
is kindness and we start doing kindness
and looking for it we start seeing
opportunities everywhere one day I was
leaving on Madison Square Garden and
there was a man sitting in a wheelchair
with a cup in one hand and a sign in the
other but what stood out most were his
eyes I mean he was looking frantically
back and forth with somebody somebody to
connect with anybody to connect with so
I saw a hotdog stand then I went over I
got a hotdog and a bottle of water and I
and I came over to him his name was
hutch and he said to me you got this for
me and I said of course and that moment
we connected and he looked at me and he
said you see me
and he called me his angel that&#39;s the
feeling of kindness little did he know
that he was my angel I wanted to be able
to help people see what I was seeing and
feel what I was feeling but kindness is
really hard to start a chelating words
so I created a film which you&#39;re gonna
see a little piece of I didn&#39;t write a
script I just told the story of the
world I live in the world I saw small
acts that left an imprint on my heart
but it&#39;s not just the world that I live
in the truth is it&#39;s the world we all
live in sometimes we just need to open
our eyes and change the perspective
[Music]
sometimes I let a God I&#39;m breathing and
I don&#39;t take me soon because I am here
sometimes in my tears I drown but I
never let me down
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
when they saw a innocent blood keep on
moving
[Music]
one act of kindness can go on and on and
sometimes like a boomerang come back to
us at a time when we need it the most
when I when I put this film up I figured
maybe it&#39;ll you know a few people will
stumble upon it little did I know that
over 20 million people would be inspired
I want to tell you a story about a young
boy a student of mine who was labeled by
everyone as a bully that&#39;s exactly what
he became he was so much more than that
there was this one incident where he got
into trouble and it was was kind of the
last straw they were talking about
kicking him out they&#39;re really ready
wrote him off and I went over and I
stood up for him I&#39;ll never ever forget
the look on his face no one had ever
done that for him before and he came
over to me with tears in his eyes and he
said I don&#39;t understand why do you care
I&#39;m so mean to you and I looked at him
and I said because I think the world of
you and I only hope that one day you
could see yourself through my eyes that
was it
kindness that boys now in college and he
meant there&#39;s troubled youth he said to
me you bet on me when no one else did
everyone deserves to have somebody to
bet on them that&#39;s kindness
I mean it&#39;s inspiring but you know
inspiration fades so the question is how
do we sustain it how do we take
inspiration and turn into action back
into inspiration again so I started an
organization that does just that I&#39;m
working on a mobile app a social network
for kindness that allows people to set
their own personal kindness goals and
see their progress be able to connect
with others and more than that actually
be able to track their acts of kindness
as they go from one person to the next
show their real impact on the world only
thing now is I I guess I got to learn
how to code you know the idea of it is
to make kind of trending because
kindness is so naturally contagious I
figured why not make it viral you know
during this week we&#39;ve been talking
about innovations and ideas I can change
the world and there are so many
different ways to change the world some
may take millions of dollars and some
may take complex strategies but what&#39;s
so cool about kindness what makes it so
amazing is that it&#39;s accessible to
everyone one act of kindness can have
unknown and profound consequences
it&#39;s extraordinary effects of ordinary
acts of kindness that can in fact change
this world thank you
