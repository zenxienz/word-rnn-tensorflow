no I don&#39;t need that Thank You Korina
well it&#39;s great to be here at the
Brooklyn Museum I work at a different
museum the American Museum of Natural
History how many of you have been there
I&#39;m a curator there I&#39;m curator the Hall
of ocean life I was curator and power of
poison we&#39;ve got another exhibition
coming up in the spring on animal
superpowers but what you may not know is
that the museum of natural history is
also basically a library of biodiversity
behind the scenes of the museum we have
stacks and stacks and stacks of
specimens of any animal out there
anywhere has a species name it&#39;s because
somebody gave it a species name and
there&#39;s a specimen sitting in a natural
history museum someplace my passion
happens to be leeches and i am the leech
guy I&#39;d like you all to sort of just
think in your heads right now what is
the leech and what do you think about
leeches and then I&#39;m going to try to
change your mind so first let me
reinforce what I think your view of
leeches is serious creatures first even
good luck
so that was the African Queen and almost
every generation has the thought about
leeches that is black slimy things
living in swamps in fact they&#39;re really
pretty they&#39;re really beautiful you&#39;ve
got two European medicinal leeches on
either side with beautiful emerald green
and ruby patterns that very large giant
Amazonian leached lying gracefully on a
friend&#39;s arm is from South America some
of the leeches that are the most pretty
are in fact leeches that live in a
marine environment most of these leeches
feed on sharks the one in the middle
feeds on sea turtles we don&#39;t know what
these frilly things are but they&#39;re
beautiful aren&#39;t they what most people
don&#39;t realize is that there&#39;s a whole
bunch of different leeches out there in
the world that don&#39;t feed on blood at
all feeding up and down the ones
building it searches for an end
then it starts to suck the Nuge sucks
its prey down like spaghetti crushing
the work we could get better than cases
so this talk is not for the squeamish of
course one of the things that we do at
the museum is we work out the
evolutionary relationships of various
organisms leeches it turns out are very
closely related to a lyga keats like
earthworms that&#39;s a very giant earthworm
you see in the upper right of the screen
the things that are closely related to
leeches are actually tiny little expo
commensal worms on all things crayfish
now people probably know that leeches
have been involved in medicine for a
very long time going back almost a
thousand years leeches were used for
bloodletting for everything from
hysteria to obesity and a lot of other
things that it really didn&#39;t work for it
wasn&#39;t medieval it was actually very
popular in the 1800s because this guy in
the upper left brucei who is a surgeon
for Napoleon really popularized it and
used upwards of 400,000 leeches at one
Hospital will that happen quickly in
Paris so much so that leeches were
extirpated from a lot of their habitat
and were the cause of some of the first
conservation movements for animals
anywhere now there is a legitimate use
for leeches and you&#39;re seeing it here
people can do microsurgery and reattach
digits for example like a finger the
gentleman up there had a singer chopped
off by the by an axe a guy on the bottom
had his ear bit off by a dog you ever
notice it&#39;s always a guy
and leeches will remove the pooling
blood to promote venous circulation
there are other cases where leeches
happen to intersect with medicine this
is a young lady from Scotland who a
month ago returned from Vietnam she had
been back in Scotland for a whole month
before she realized she had the sliding
feeling in her nose she went to the
doctor and they pulled this beautiful
specimen of mix of Della Anand daily I
out of her nose now I think its mix of
Della Anand daily I the problem is is
that you in disgust she burned it and
threw it out what I wanted to do is
study it and find out what species it
was this business of leeches getting
involved in mucous membranes of people
we heard about mucous membranes earlier
it&#39;s good that we did this after lunch
right so that&#39;s a picture of a leech in
someone&#39;s eye in India that Dean of
jealousy rocks literally the terrifying
ferocious leech and there are a bunch of
cases of this that happened around the
world there was one that we encountered
from Peru where there is a young boy who
had a leech that was stuck up in his
nostril this is an endoscope going up to
the back of the sinuses there if you
look carefully you&#39;ll eventually see the
leech that is hanging out and it&#39;ll be
pulled out now this leech was amazing
because it had the largest piece of any
leech anywhere in the world you can see
the teeth in the middle left over there
and because it had the largest teeth and
it was causing pain for these children
we decided to get it was a nude species
and a new genus and so we absolutely
named it Turan abdellah Rex
so that we can say that t-rex is alive
and well feeding on children in the
Amazon when we actually look at the
evolutionary relationships of that
species everything in yellow in that
evolutionary trees in fact the leech
that feeds on mucous membranes of
mammals this isn&#39;t a happenstance thing
it&#39;s been going on for millions of years
some of the research that we do actually
concerns salivary anticoagulants in
leeches that were first used actually in
the first human dialysis treatment ever
what we&#39;re doing is actually taking
these compounds this is the human
coagulation cascade that happens all of
these places in green are we&#39;re leeches
interfere with blood clotting what we&#39;re
doing is getting those compounds out of
the leeches working out their
evolutionary history to try to find out
how that&#39;s happened over many millions
of years so yes save the music but
please save the leeches thank
but we&#39;re not done could my trusty
assistant come on stage
okay I think do we high in the hosting
we have one biting a bunch all right
let&#39;s let&#39;s take it out gently gently
Jim oh yeah you got one there I got
lemons ok yeah okay so this one&#39;s not
feeding any not know that one&#39;s not see
I could bid me oh that one&#39;s not feeding
oh no that&#39;s okay wait wait wait wait
wait wait but this one is definitely
feeding in the way I can tell is that
when the other one over here don&#39;t
forget about that one you have a treat
you have three beauties so what&#39;s really
Kyle is there is leaving on me was that
one just bit me it kind of hurt when
Lena are feeding they go into complete
tour / they&#39;re just like drunk with your
blood look that guy is like got slime
dripping off of him is that Lucas is it
Lucas really yeah just a little bit and
a little bit of water so if you want me
to remove them oh you can leave in for a
minute I don&#39;t think I want to keep them
on to the whole break but you know you
guys want a few anyone oh yeah maybe so
the way to remove a leech don&#39;t burn a
leech because you might miss me or
yourself don&#39;t stall to leech because
it&#39;s like putting salt in a wound and it
already hurt right just kind of push its
face aside like this there we go and
this there we go they usually don&#39;t feed
from the palm of the hand oh yeah I&#39;m
good you&#39;ve got like some hot demands
huh all right now let&#39;s turn it over and
we do have a little bit of blood coming
here what&#39;s interesting is that because
of the anticoagulant the leech the wound
will probably not heal for a couple of
hours so I&#39;ve got some God&#39;s work okay
good thank you for that thank you very
much get around to Kelly
I don&#39;t know dude here get you some yeah
I&#39;ll take the GOG right now that&#39;d be
good thank you there you go how are the
other two they don&#39;t good thing I&#39;m all
set thank you excited yeah
