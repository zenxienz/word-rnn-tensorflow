so I had a plan and it got all up
um and I actually thought it I was going
to play a song that&#39;s a little long but
I could I could do one thing or the
other so I thought I would let you guys
vote um I have an the new song that I
was going to play which I wrote actually
right after Ted last year is basically
about my shitty year getting yelled at
on the Internet
it&#39;s very dark it&#39;s beautiful but you
know it&#39;s depressing and as cancer in it
and or I could play you an old one
that&#39;s shorter that&#39;s kind of like a
encapsulation of the popular music
continuum and has Lady Gaga and stuff in
it so can I just I can see if you want
the the new depressing one raise your
hand okay if you want the old
light-hearted a popular culture music
continuum all it&#39;s a tie uh where&#39;s
Amy Cuddy which one do you want you&#39;re
awesome both both okay so this is going
to take about 15 minutes is that okay
Chris no oh god Neil Gaiman&#39;s quick I&#39;m
running out of time
okay I&#39;ll play the light-hearted one if
you want to see the depressing one come
to my gig tonight
[Applause]
where&#39;s the gig Oh folk theater I
tweeted together a gig in the last three
days including I had a volunteer stage
manager come to me I was like this is
like a Ted people nightmare I have a
stage manager I&#39;ve never met who I&#39;m

going to meet at the gig at 8:00 and I&#39;m
giving her all the money to give to the
Vancouver Food Bank because I trust her
her name is Sarah
[Music]
okay I won&#39;t give this a long
introduction just think that there was
an argument on the internet a few years
ago uh while I was hosting a webcast
about whether Lady Gaga was a real
artist or not and the song remains very
relevant especially in the face of Miley
Cyrus who some of you know it&#39;s called
Gaga Palmer Madonna a polemic
she is part of the music continuum and
she is part of this difficult world and
she wears outfits made of aluminium she
is a 23 she is a 23 she is a 23 and a
half year old girl I am part of the
music continuum and I am part of this
difficult world and I&#39;m often naked and
play the accordion
I am a 33 I am a 33
I am a 33 and a half year old girl she
is part of the music continuum and also
part of this difficult world and she was
the first one to often have no clothes
on she is not 53
she&#39;s only 50 but I used her anyway cuz
she fits well in this song art is great
that way you can do anything you can
make pop music you can paint ducks but
if you&#39;re a pop artist and you&#39;re a
woman then it&#39;s much more likely that
people will say your art sucks
making pop music isn&#39;t for everyone
actually that&#39;s it technically
is that&#39;s why it&#39;s pop music now I&#39;ve
confused myself I&#39;m gonna start a new
verse and I&#39;ll say it like this it&#39;s
kind of a mini TED talk when you think
about it a lot of idea isn&#39;t it some
artists focus on love and simplicity
some artists focus on fashion and fame
then sometimes some artists try to do
everything which is impossible I think
those people are brave art is simple
just ask Andy Warhol if he weren&#39;t dead
he would tell you the truth call it a
masterpiece call it a urinal it doesn&#39;t
matter it&#39;s art so there&#39;s nothing to
prove I&#39;m not sure what the point if
this song is and I know this song
doesn&#39;t actually have to have any point
at all even good rhymes in it like Lady
Gaga and also Madonna I&#39;m just trying to
entertain people make a living in pay my
and without having to have a job I hate
and hopefully find an audience that will
love and accept me and not think I&#39;m a
narcissist for wanting to be a performer
and find true inner peace and that&#39;s it
[Music]
thank you there&#39;s one more verse but
it&#39;s short I swear
now a question to further our dialogue
is all art real art and is pop art art
and if someone talented wants to make
pop music why should we worry when
there&#39;s so much other wrong thank
you and now I now I get a 40 second
interview with Chris Anderson if he
wants to if you want do you want to say
hi or should we just be done another
song okay tonight talking cuz you&#39;re so
damn good at it oh thanks I really uh um
I really my life has definitely gone in
a different interesting direction
because of the talk I sort of figured
that I would do a TED talk and that
would be great and then I would get back
to my normal life but it&#39;s it did change
things and I&#39;m now more known for my TED
talk for then for being a musician which
is kind of weird did you hear from
anyone who you talked to asked in a
different way
oh my god yeah I mean my life is now an
endless stream of people coming up to me
in the street and crying some of them
saying I you know and all sorts of
people which is the interest I mean my
music connects with a lot of generally
younger people and angsty people and
arty people but you know mothers and
doctors and teachers and nonprofit
people and so many people tell me
they&#39;ve been empowered by the talk it&#39;s
amazing and I&#39;m writing a book about the
talk so I kind of I responded to the
response and was like wow I had a nerve
what&#39;s the nerve I kind of wanted to
explore it my own gut when I had the
tote was that you were actually there
was you were tapping into something that
might that goes very profoundly into
the future of work may look like like
the way the way that many people are
paid in the future the future is going
to be about a million new forms of
creativity it&#39;s not clear that it will
all come with a price label on it
it may come this Amanda Palmer kind of
please maybe how about it yeah I think a
lot of it is about I mean there&#39;s like
all new kinds of exchange but so much of
it is about it&#39;s like a me it&#39;s like
about the attitude that you take to the
person you&#39;re exchanging with and that&#39;s
discussed you know you can discuss
economics in the future in the Internet
up the wazoo but if you&#39;re not actually
you know embodying the correct space
with the person you&#39;re dealing with and
it doesn&#39;t matter thank you so much for
coming back Amanda and thank you for
bringing Neil Gaiman with you too that
was very cool if it&#39;s you&#39;re having
[Applause]
