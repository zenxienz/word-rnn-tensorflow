hello Ted women I have the world&#39;s
greatest job I am a rocket scientist
great at cocktail parties as an
aerospace biomedical engineer I get to
solve really challenging problems
whether it&#39;s by space or sea it&#39;s really
about the human condition how do humans
perform so we learn through studying in
isolated confined environments studying
people performance and let me bring it
back home from space back to earth what
have we learned a spacesuit is the
world&#39;s smallest spacecraft spacesuit
equals spacecraft show you smiley Apollo
bloopers you probably haven&#39;t seen these
before the world&#39;s you know greatest
spacesuit for 40 year old technology no
okay it has limited mobility but you&#39;re
gonna pressurize cans fantastic
pressurizes you gives you your oxygen
scrubs your carbon dioxide a little
micrometeorite protection helps little
radiation but we can do better
our dream is to invent the world&#39;s
coolest spacesuit for Mars boat need a
little bit help I want to take you on a
journey from Earth to Mars and show you
three suits this is called our gravity
loading countermeasure suit astronauts
in space have a significant
musculoskeletal loss you&#39;re gonna lose
about 40 percent of your muscle strength
that&#39;s the good news one to two percent
of your bone mineral density your
skeletal integrity now who wants to go
on my four-year Mars mission how about
six months to Space Station so our
gravity loading countermeasure suit is
for inside the vehicle inside Space
Station and it&#39;s an exercise suit
okay it&#39;s better than lifting big power
weights right we dial in the tension of
the elasticity from your shoulders down
to your soles to recreate one body
loading as you&#39;re pushing around and
flying around but we even more
passionate about the earth applications
this young gentleman has cerebral palsy
so we dream about inventing an enhanced
locomotor suit for him to increase his
muscle tone his stepping
ability just so he can do daily
activities just enjoy life so is pretty
inspiring trust that&#39;s what keeps us
going we&#39;ll be flying this blue suit to
the International Space Station in 2015
with dr. James wall D of Australia the
European Space Agency my lab King&#39;s
College London just call us a design
team from the UN the second suit the
conventional space suit gas pressurized
about 140 kilos that&#39;s pushed in 300
pounds not too bad for weightlessness
but boy is it injuring our crew it&#39;s
about 25 major shoulder surgeries
recently from this capability well how
can we help solve that problem well we
can invent a suit within a suit because
I can&#39;t get rid of gravity here so I go
in there water and train at the NASA
neutral buoyancy laboratory but guess
what I sink right to the bottom of the
suit so I&#39;m practicing and practicing
because I have to get it perfect for
spaceflight but my shoulders and my
muscles are rubbing on that side bearing
it&#39;s just a fancy word and spacesuit
design for the shoulder bearing so how
can we alleviate that with our great
designers love of my life my partner
gave trotty leads to design can we come
up with a suit within a suit protect
those astronauts and my doctoral student
Ellie Anderson yes we can we have a
wearable octopus octopus suit pressure
sensing so for the first time we&#39;re
gonna measure human motion within the
suit how are the astronauts moving
within the suit we can quantify that and
then we design the protection to just
keep them healthy and well and let them
do their tasks as best they can
it has space applications we&#39;re pretty
excited about the other applications as
well biomedical athletic and play just
like Jessica and all these heroines on
the stage before you today why play
literally play we play it as a musical
suit and why because it inspires us it&#39;s
fun for engineers we&#39;re not geeky and
you&#39;re just come on you know we have fun
play a little bit of music I love these
tracks so we have fun and mostly because
that&#39;s how we create and that&#39;s when
we&#39;re at our best that takes me to my
third suit another bio suit and
Deborah&#39;s gonna come on out here
thank you for helping me out Deborah&#39;s
gonna come right out here in my bio suit
for Mars Thank You someone to tell you a
little bit about this suit it&#39;s not a
gas pressurized 140 kilo system mm-hmm
know what I&#39;m gonna shrink wrap you okay
how are we gonna do that so we&#39;re gonna
put the pressure directly on your skin
now I have to provide 30% of an
atmosphere 30 kilo Pascal&#39;s 1/3 of an
atmosphere keeps you alive in the vacuum
of space so can we do it are we up to
the challenge we think so and I want to
give you maximum mobility okay because
Mars is tough why we going to Mars to
search for the evidence of life okay
past life four billion years ago but
still it would rewrite all the
scientific books if we have the evidence
of past life in our solar system so
that&#39;s what we want to explore Mars a
little challenging Valles Marineris now
that&#39;s the Grand Canyon of the solar
system ten times longer than the Grand
Canyon on the US the mountains yeah
they&#39;re big Olympus Mons three times
higher than Everest at 25 kilometers so
is she up to it to be a Martian extreme
Explorer I think so she can move she can
bend it&#39;s pretty comfortable this is the
pressure layer remember we&#39;re applying a
pressure this is a mock-up the
engineering prototypes of course have to
apply all the pressure she&#39;d be a little
too snug if we put on the real prototype
and how to wear it for two hours with us
so what&#39;s the what&#39;s the design behind
this first in the materials we can get
about 20% of the atmosphere again we
need 30% that&#39;s the design go get about
20% with passive elastic material that&#39;s
kind of the white you&#39;re looking at
shrink wrapper a little bit we get
almost all the way there but we need
something else active materials so my
doctoral student Brad whole shoe is
coming up with some great work
shape-memory alloys you might know about
him or a nickel hi there nickel titanium
people like to call them muscle wires
they&#39;re pretty cool so we need to shrink
wrap a little bit more
so this is just a mock-up of course but
zip you push down there all right now
I&#39;m getting a couple extra centimeters
there so I can go from my 20 kilo
pascals 30 kilo pascals voila we have
enough pressure and we&#39;ve just
demonstrated enough pressure production
with our active materials but I still
want her to be as mobile as possible you
saw those Apollo bloopers great
technology for 40 years ago we haven&#39;t
improved much on the gas pressurized
suits so we can do better how can we do
better
inspired by uber all&#39;s early work on
patterning geometry if you want to move
around very flexible you&#39;ve been patient
sitting with us all morning move around
a little bit and if I drew circles all
over your arms and legs what would
happen to those circles like in my
animation the circle would turn
elliptical and those two red lines
they&#39;re very special
those are bisecting diameters from the
circle to the ellipse they stay on both
surfaces and they only pivot they only
rotate they do not extend those are
called the lines of non extension so we
throw a little math out at three
dimensional eigen vector analysis voila
the Spider Man suit that&#39;s the pattern
of the black lines and the embedded gold
line just see here this elegant math
engineering know-how designs a wonderful
aesthetic solution to give us maximum
mobility and requires minimum energy
expenditure I want all of your energy to
go into exploring Mars not wasted in
overcoming this big pressurized bulky
suit so we dream we dream big we want to
enable humans we dream of superhuman
performance I dream of a world without
without with no disability let&#39;s just
get rid of it no one should have a
disability only ability we need to
celebrate the ability of humans because
we can all perform and we need to
enhance it people need a little help my
Martian astronauts will need a little
help when they get to the surface
because of all that muscle bone loss so
we dream of superhuman capability we
work on it inspires us every day we&#39;re
very inspired by exploration by thinking
about helping humanity just one kid at a
time and then onward to though my love
and passion of design and engineering so
final image
and that I&#39;d like to show you is oh one
one thing about this the helmet which we
can display here second to final image
what&#39;s the day in the life of the
Martian astronaut gonna be like you saw
those mountains you have to go up and
what you have to do but we need to embed
very interesting but complicated IT
systems the IT system you put on that
helmet put on your Google glass wish you
good with goggle vest has to be very
enhanced version because we need to
write our own code for it we have the
code we just can&#39;t import it how how
much well we&#39;re getting there
remember you ready for the next reason
how how much oxygen do I have left
Oh 60% David good good keep going my
Rovers my robots are all with me on this
journey I&#39;m gonna go down the slope
bring up a three-dimensional enhanced
vision whoa what&#39;s that slope mmm 20
degrees okay I can do that don&#39;t send
the rover&#39;s down that&#39;s 30 degrees right
there so we&#39;re all a team exploration is
always a team that you heard Diana say
so eloquently so the last image I leave
you with is earth spaceship earth as
coined by Buckminster Fuller it&#39;s
important for all of our research to
reflect down on the earth spaceship
earth if I take earth and shrink it to
the size of a basketball our
life-support system our atmosphere is
three human hairs thick as you see here
so the inspiration to take our work back
down to earth and we&#39;re all stewards of
this planet please enjoy the view of the
Southern Lights taken from Space Station
the astronauts are there in the 90
minutes we&#39;ve had these talks of all my
heroines inspiring me they&#39;ve already
circumnavigated earth that&#39;s how long it
takes and here&#39;s the image they show you
[Music]
thank you and thank to Deborah
[Applause]
