get the spray years out of our house
that believe it or not is how my
grandmother would greet my friends as
you could imagine I wasn&#39;t real fond of
her this is a photo of my grandmother on
her fourth birthday in 1909 in New York
City when I was 16 I found out that the
day after this picture was taken she was
kidnapped abducted by one of the gangs
of extortionist known as the black pan
that prayed in Little Italy&#39;s they had
her three months and it was only because
of the strength and cunning of my great
grandmother that she was returned alive
it took me years to get the full story
but when I did I was finally able to
love my grandmother and to understand
the transformative power of knowing your
family history that set me on a journey
i created a family tree and traveled to
sheila italy&#39;s the kalabrian fishing
village my family came from within an
hour of arriving I was shocked to
discover we still had relatives in
Shilla that led to endless meals and
bottles of wine but also the realization
that my ancestors story my story was
shared by people I didn&#39;t even know
existed better yet we each held missing
puzzle pieces of our family&#39;s narrative
when I saw Sheila I could not understand
when my grandfather said he would never
return turns out there was a good reason
in 1908 there was an earthquake and
tsunami they killed over a hundred
thousand people in Sicily and Calabria
most of sheila was wiped out when i
asked my newly found cousin Chaz a day
how we survived he told me a remarkable
story about how my family was in a small
fishing boat slightly north there&#39;s a
tidal wave that slammed back and forth
across the Strait of Messina they nearly
drowned and they may have wished they
had when they reached the shore
everything and
everyone they ever loved was gone as a
12 year old my grandfather spent nearly
a year digging up the bodies of his
friends and relatives family stories can
also help make history tangible world
war two became more than facts and
figures when my dad told us his story he
was on a carrier headed to the Pacific
but because he was a good swimmer he was
taken off the ship and stationed in
Hawaii as a water combat instructor his
brother wasn&#39;t so lucky he was fighting
on the front lines in Germany throughout
the war my dad would send him letters
that included a handful of Sam the
thought of my uncle freezing in a
foxhole pouring that sand through his
fingers made the tragedy of war and the
randomness real and heartbreaking so as
I learned family history can help you
better understand yourself others in the
past but it is critically important for
another reason from the human genome
project to the plur if eration of
genealogy sites we are discovering our
paths and plotting family trees in huge
numbers there&#39;s now nearly 40 1,000,000
family trees on ancestry.com alone but
those trees are just the start armatures
for the narrative the stories are what
matter why because history is
storytelling and most of the stories
have been told by people who look like
this granted there&#39;s probably some fine
historians in that bunch but history
written from one perspective can be
skewed and incomplete family stories can
help counter the single narrative that
so often become history they could bring
to light little known event like the
1908 Italian earthquake and the terror
of the black hand and family histories
can help fight stereotypes for Italian
Americans heroine like my
great-grandmother Giovanna who fought
the black hand they&#39;ve been obscured by
entertainment that has romanticized the
Mafia and Jersey Shore
culture eventually I wrote a novel based
on our family stories thousands of
people have said that the book parallels
their own immigrant family history and
that it is open windows to their past I
thought I had written a story about my
family and it turns out it&#39;s a
collective story of a people and an era
that&#39;s rarely in textbooks history is
powerful it helps us understand the
presence and guides our future but whose
history is it what other stories are we
missing perhaps if historical accounts
were more inclusive we would make better
choices as a society today so what&#39;s in
your attic what light can your family
story shed on our past I dare you to
find out
