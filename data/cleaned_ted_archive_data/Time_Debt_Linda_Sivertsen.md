I am a time debtor I was given that

lovely label at 10:00 p.m. one night I
just made a pot of black tea to fuel yet
another work-related all-nighter and my
friend Jay she wasn&#39;t having it she seen
me do this before and was all freaked
out it was going to hurt my health time
debtor I hadn&#39;t heard the term before
but I could feel truth all over it
was I wasting time I didn&#39;t have always
racing to catch up ok fine but she&#39;s
suggesting I had to somehow reimburse
myself for the hours of sleep I was
about to lose yeah like that was going
to happen in regular getting you spend
money that you don&#39;t have so it would
make sense and in time didn&#39;t you spend
the time that you do have incorrectly
but I didn&#39;t have a choice my mind
flashed on the 60 all-nighters I had
clocked that year to keep from losing
everything my husband of 19 years had
left me for another woman but I was
keeping it together I mean my house had
slipped into foreclosure and I couldn&#39;t
bribe our grieving teenager out of his
bathrobe for a million bucks but I knew
I&#39;d be ok if I could just power through
more billable work hours
never mind that what I needed were more
light hours part of me really wanted to
be open minded that night talking with
Jade about this time debtor crap but
honestly I was proud that I could rally
while everyone else slept and besides I
was liquored up on caffeine I didn&#39;t
have time for a bummer reality check
then she said that she had been going to
be a meetings that&#39;s short for debtors
anonymous now I&#39;m thinking she&#39;s really
lost it she&#39;s not in debt but she
explained there are all kinds of debtors
you can lose your time in many different
ways
live beyond your means and I was like
she said Linda your work hours are out
of control of course she was right I
wasn&#39;t spending my time wisely I was
over investing in client care
and under investing in self-care I was
so busy reacting to other people&#39;s
emergencies that I had little time for
the prevention of my own instead of
manage my time my time was managing me
it&#39;s pretty devastating to see how even
the most important things to me were not
immune my son and I had just written a
book together about protecting the
environment who&#39;s really dear to my
heart but I was too busy with work and
divorce drama to fully promote it but I
know I&#39;m not alone as I think of my
successful friends time dating is the
norm more than an addiction I would say
that it&#39;s become an affliction the
disease of our era so I got myself to a
couple of debtors Anonymous meetings and
I read everything I could that they
offered in all of it rocked my world
especially a symptom of compulsive
getting that VA called terminal
vagueness did you catch that
that&#39;s terminal not as an airport but as
in lethal and then when you don&#39;t have
an accurate sense of your situation your
denial and bad habits can kill you
but even if being vague doesn&#39;t shorten
your life it does prevent you from fully
living it one cure for terminal
vagueness is trunking track your numbers
track your time
boy tracked my money I had my bills on a
huge color-coded wall chart but when it
came to time specifically I wasn&#39;t
tracking the right metrics imagine that
X is your number of hours and Y is your
number of years over the course of a
lifetime we think our x and y are
infinite but of course they&#39;re not we
say that time is money but it isn&#39;t I&#39;ve
lost enough loved ones in my life to
know that time is energy it&#39;s our
lifeblood when we drain it away it&#39;s
gone our plans bankrupt
so I had to get real and I&#39;d like to get
real here with you about what time that
looks like and how I got the situation
largely under control because maybe
you&#39;ll relate it started by saying that
those all-nighters I was so bloody proud
of were sapping the quality of my
all-day errs what I thought of as a
net-net was in fact a net not to put
this in monetary terms let&#39;s say that
you earned $3,000 a month and you spend
5,000 it&#39;s pretty easy to see that&#39;s not
going to work for very long right you
can ignore the overspend you can choose
not to open up your bills but you&#39;re
still in the red and it&#39;s recorded
somewhere the two kids acknowledged
sheet of their time okay in this
audience some of you probably do but are
you tracking what matters most to you
are just clocking hours in your
smartphone so what does life look like
through the eyes of a time debtor here
are four common symptoms see if any of
these feel familiar number one is
thinking you&#39;re a machine this is
leading that you should be able to do
whatever it takes just because you used
to or because someone else expects you
to which you really crave is sanity and
long-term fuel but you borage on candy
bars for a quick energy high and then
curl up in the fetal position under your
desk number two is forgetting the
happens factor this is the call from
your high meanest co-worker you knew you
didn&#39;t have time to answer or the
surprise detour on the way to your
meeting boom you&#39;re in the red time life
and your day has barely begun
number three is denial of the laws of
time and space physics you know you have

to be at work by 9:00 a.m. but you&#39;re
still trying to pack in a workout cook
for the entire family and make a call to
your best friend you&#39;ve been an adult
for years now people but you&#39;re still
shocked by how long regular everyday
stuff takes I saved my favorite for last
number four is time shock this is where
you look up at the clock and go huh oh
my god which is happening
sorry I thought I had more time you&#39;ve
literally lost time like aliens have
abducted you for me two things help stop
the madness first I just started
tracking my time so that I could be
aware of what was happening thankfully
it&#39;s easy to talk the minutes it takes
to do most things second I had to
uncover the emotions underneath my
behavior so I could get to the heart of
why time vetting is often a symptom of
something deep and dangerous our
emotional lives can have our schedules
by the throat some people spend way more
time at work than their peers because
they have a deep fear of not being good
enough others invest in friendships that
don&#39;t serve them because they fear
loneliness many run themselves ragged so
they don&#39;t have to feel when I look back
at where I lost the most time hands-down
it was - relationship drama with my ex I
have spent a lot of time in and
recovering from our dysfunction I had
made a diary document on my computer and
I logged the beautiful stuff but also
his hurtful words and his betrayals but
I often erased those entries when he
would apologize because I loved him and
I felt guilty for focusing on the
negative for recording the truth of my
own feelings after my separation I fell
for a sexy mystery man who baked
homemade pies and sang love songs yeah
and very quickly I was be railed by his
moods and I was spending valuable time
up at night helping him build his
business when I needed more rest for my
own once again as vague in love as I was
with time I no longer erased my diary
entries thank God but I could not make
sense of them he yelled at me at noon

and then wined and dined me at 7:00 he
shut me down with silence and then
reeled in my kid with laughter my poor
sister
and friends were on speed-dial and we&#39;ve
spent stupid amounts of time processing
is this normal and why happy
is there more good than bad but here&#39;s
the thing
we live in a society that measures
everything to dissent to the inch to the
pound but we have no way to clearly
assess our own feelings one day I had an
idea
it&#39;s like color code my diary entries to
match my overall feelings maybe maybe I
can be my own witness my own best friend
put myself on speed dial
it started simple with only three colors
blue for tears
yellow for mellow and green for romance
colors y&#39;all don&#39;t lie I could see my
romance at a glance and blissful Green
Day&#39;s were always followed by tearful
blue ones our life together was more sad
than happy I could see the loss of days
and I had such a bill to pay I had been
so blind I wasted time in unhappy
relationships and wasted more time
trying to make sense of them my patterns
didn&#39;t change because you can&#39;t change
what you don&#39;t see logging my feelings
put color and shape around the time I
had wasted I had been powerless but I
now had the power in my own hands I&#39;m
getting affects everyone thanks for a
minute about which emotions concerning
love or work or body image or family or
friendship are training your life blood
which emotions and bad habits are
robbing you of your vitality we all long
to make a difference in this world and
we lose chunks of time priceless
momentum don&#39;t get me wrong there will
always be fans of time that put us into
debt like grief that require their own
timetable or situations too complex to
track like moving or having a baby but
how often do rush through the things you
really want to focus on I&#39;m now
recovering time better
I could have done that earlier if
someone had taken me by the shoulders
and said look where you&#39;re spending your
time color coding on my computer saved
me and it was so easy I highly recommend
it you can also use paper and
highlighters if you want to calendar and
highlighters
I also if you have an iPhone I created
an app to make it even easier as you can
see it&#39;s called the boyfriend law but
you can track anything nowadays I
maintain myself a priority and my head
hits at pillow by 11 p.m. I would never
ever think to drink a love much less a
pot of black tea after sundown the other
night my fiance and I were snuggled up
watching a movie and the thought of
working late to make up for lost time
felt like someone else&#39;s nightmare in
the mornings before I even think to
check my email I made the time to check
in with me first to see what I need from
me I have become my own best friend
so think about making time your new
boyfriend or partner best buddy or
favorite client the joy you want to log
how you spend your time can feel like
the longest most miserable relationship
of your life or the best love affair
you&#39;ve ever had so I stand before you
today hoping that the minutes you have
so generously shared with me have been
well spent and that you give yourself
the gift of the time it takes to
accomplish whatever matters most to you
refuse to write a bad check on your
greatest asset your time your life thank
