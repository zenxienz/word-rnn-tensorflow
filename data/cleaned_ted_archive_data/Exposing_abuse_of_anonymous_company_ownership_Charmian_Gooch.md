back in March I was thrilled to stand on
the Ted stage in Vancouver and launched
my wish as this year&#39;s TED Prize winner
my wish is very simple it&#39;s for us to
know who really owns and controls
companies so they can no longer be used
anonymously against the public good and
through this for us together to launch a
new era of openness in business it&#39;s
been a really exciting six months and is
a lot to update you about I&#39;d like to
start by sharing with you a short film
that Ted have helped us to make that
shows just how the structures anonymous
companies have been for the tens of
thousands of people affected by Mexican
drug gangs there is a problem in Mexico
a group of men controlled brewing
and killed
they rule through fear
in America one man has made it he had it
all the businesses the money good life
by yourself
[Music]
this is the story of one family good the
bad and the ugly truth an American
company laundering Mexican drug money
three brothers two parts one dirty
secret the real owners hidden the
profits concealed this is a problem
throughout the world anonymous companies
have been legal for years like a shell
they conceal owners protect criminals
that the shell is starting to crack
question thank you so why is my wish to
end anonymous company ownership it&#39;s
because over many years as a field
investigator and campaigner I&#39;ve come up
against this type of company time and
time again all of us at Global Witness
have these companies are underpin almost
every case of corruption and
environmental destruction that we&#39;ve
ever seen they used to tear down the
forests kick people off their land and
rip off millions of us around the world
now just to be clear I&#39;m not fancy
business far from it but I am against
the practice of secrecy that allows
criminals to fester behind faceless
corporate structures and that film you
just saw it talked about American front
companies and anonymous companies a
World Bank study looked at over 200
cases of grand corruption worth fifty
six billion dollars it found over
seventy percent use anonymous owners and
guess what America was 10 times the most
comfortable country America ten times so
when I when I launch my wish many in the
audience have questions about it because
in the era of Edward Snowden when we&#39;re
all understandably a bit freaked out
about our privacy we&#39;ve just been
hearing some more yesterday well this
can seem like a way to hold Big Brother
at bay but this isn&#39;t about delving into
people&#39;s private lives it&#39;s about having
enough information to know who really
owns and controls companies it&#39;s about
finding that balance between protecting
our rights to personal privacy and the
need to stop criminals I suppose
fundamentally it&#39;s about saying that for
our economies to
properly and fairly we need the right
information now another message from the
Ted community was that people wants to
understand more they want to hear the
real human stories behind this issue so
today I&#39;m launching a new project to map
out the abuse of anonymous company
ownership around the world it&#39;s early
days but it already reveals a pretty
shocking picture from modern-day slavery
to arms traffickers and more this is a
key problem with companies involved in
laundering billions of dollars and in so
much misery you&#39;ll be able to click
through on this using this online map
and see the stories about corruption and
other crimes and we&#39;ll be adding stories
all the time as it is a work in progress
living on many in the tech community
were keen to help us create a prototype
public registry that would start to
collect and make public information on
who really owns and controls companies
and we&#39;re working with the tech
community and key partners like Oakland
corporates and all help is welcome I am
also delighted to be able to report that
the business community is getting
involved we are now working with the B
team on this issue they are a group of
visionary global business leaders who
the queen them have set up and runs
company&#39;s worth many billions of dollars
the B team includes mo ibrahim the
telecoms entrepreneur richard branson
founder of virgin york insights who led
puma paul polman of Unilever and
brazil&#39;s very own year male a house who
is here in the audience today
so people are joining us all the time
will you join us too this is how you can
help business leaders the B team has
shown the way so please talk to me if
you want to help us make the business
case for transparency or help in some
other way and everyone can tell the
world about this problem please share
that online map and the stories it
health and all of us here in Rio and
beyond well we can make our voices heard
too because in just one month the g20
finance ministers will be meeting they
represent the world&#39;s largest economies
and action to deal with anonymous
companies is on their agenda so all of
us here at Ted global please tweet the
Brazilian government today and let them
know you support this issue and finally
what next well we&#39;ve seen some
incredible momentum and this momentum
needs your help now so many people from
the Ted community have given their time
and their supporting their ideas and
it&#39;s just amazing what people working
together can achieve so please join me
on this journey and let&#39;s make this
change happen thank
[Applause]
