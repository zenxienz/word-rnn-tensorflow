thank you very much this evening I want
to take us beyond the edge of the sea so
we are going to go to beyond where you
usually think about normally if you look
at a see a picture like this this
Pacific Ocean we&#39;ve been sitting on you
look at the surface and you don&#39;t see
beneath it and also when we look at the
planet we see the surface and we say
three quarters of the planet is covered
by water but in fact it&#39;s more than
ninety five percent of our biosphere
where organisms live are in the deep sea
this is a huge part of our planet and it
matters and it&#39;s also a place where you
should care this is a cartoon from 1980
1983 in the new in The New Yorker
magazine I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t care
about the bottom of the sea but I don&#39;t
this is a pervasive view because I think
we don&#39;t really understand what&#39;s down
there what is down there can be really
stunning glorious animals very exquisite
and design very graceful in their
motions things you just want to know
more about right you see these animals
you look on the seafloor you see
creatures that are unrecognizable well k
octopus you&#39;ll recognize that guy but
there&#39;s some animals here in these
videos that I can&#39;t tell you what that
thing is for instance so we haven&#39;t now
the ability to access the deep sea we
can take beautiful pictures the cameras
now that we have can zoom in and look at
tentacles and tentacles of tentacles and
see details at my eyes can see so it&#39;s a
spectacular world it&#39;s a chance to
really understand what&#39;s going on to see
the way we can do that now the way we
never could before I am a deep-sea
violence I study mostly the animals that
live in hot springs on the seafloor on
these mid-ocean ridges mid-ocean ridges
are places where the earth is or ocean
crust is spreading apart and they are
volcanic systems pretty much anytime any
day there&#39;s a volcanic eruption going on
somewhere in the ocean in the deep water
may be more than one eruption that just
happen all the time down there it&#39;s a
very dynamic kind of geological setting
and this heat
that drives the mountain ranges that
causes the rock to be buoyant also moves
is the plates are moving apart and that
those rocks becomes fractured and fish
ered sea water can percolate down
through there gets heated up by the hot
rock comes out from the surface of the
sea floor as black smoker chimneys so
these are hot springs on the sea floor
black smoker to me and they are the
submarine analogue of terrestrial hot
springs of geysers they are pretty
spectacular to see very primordial
looking temperatures 350 degrees Celsius
coming out of here they&#39;re so hot
they&#39;re sterile nothing can live there
okay so it cares about that except that
sometimes often in fact most places
they&#39;re leaky and we see things like
bacteria okay bacteria well these are
actually pre specials because you can
see those there&#39;s no microscope here
might have been a zoom on the camera but
these are macroscopic you really can see
them with your naked eye fake creatures
these animals are primary producers in
these systems so they&#39;re living in this
area where warm water is flowing up
there getting chemicals and they are
like green plants on land but instead
their primary producers making making
organic material without sunlight so
what they&#39;re doing is taking chemicals
from the warm water coming up from the
sea floor that&#39;s so fine and then
they&#39;re mixing that with the oxygen
happening in the bacterial cell that
creates cellular energy ATP and that&#39;s
what the microbes are feeding on that
having grown multiply they get that
nutrition so this is chemosynthesis the
idea of chemosynthesis really changed
the way we think about the origin of
life on our planet and in fact we think
that at hydrothermal vents right now
there are the clays that make membrane
like mesit systems there are proton
pumps there are proto chemicals proto
biotic prebiotic chemicals that are part
of the system that could have where life
could have originated in fact some of us
think that life may be originating right
now at Hot Springs but we can&#39;t we don&#39;t
see it
cuz it&#39;s being at being eaten by the
organisms that have evolved over time so
it&#39;s really interesting from thinking
about origin of life and also thinking
about life on other planets so in
planetary bodies so chemosynthesis using
chemical energy instead of sunlight that
opens up a whole range of extreme
environments that we see in the solar
system and the universe that organisms
could have evolved used to evolve back
on earth we look at these hot springs on
the seafloor giant tubeworms the iconic
animals the blood red plumes really very
beautiful in life they get eaten by
other things these two worms are called
it can be as big as me and it can be
about you know an inch or so in diameter
they have no mouth no digestive system
so the big puzzle when they were
discovered was how do they eat fact they
have bacteria inside of them it&#39;s the
same kind of bacteria that are
autotrophic that are primary producers
so the tube worm eats the bacteria and
it delivers through that red plume the
chemicals that the bacteria needs to eat
on I want those two worms occur on the
East Pacific Rise on the mountain range
they&#39;re the hot springs on the East
Pacific Rise I want to just show you one
is the next slide some of the variation
that we see we have a biogeography
events inconsistent they&#39;re not the same
animals everywhere so we&#39;ll take a quick
look at the Scotia arc the central
Indian Ridge the southwest Pacific Beth
mark systems and the hydrothermal vents
in mid-atlantic ridge just a couple of
still photographs to show you some of
this variety in the top left there are
hundreds and hundreds of crown there&#39;s
scaly foot gastropods mussels shrimp on
the mid-atlantic ridge I want to talk a
little bit about the shrimp they&#39;re
pretty darn cool these guys form over
the black smoker chimneys they&#39;re there
in a thousand 1500 per square meter they
unlike the tube worms they do have a
normal digestive system but if they have
their bacteria on the outside they&#39;re
basically farming the bacteria and
picking them up with their mouth parts
are stuffing the bacteria in their mouth
I was feeding that way but what&#39;s
particular about these guys is they
don&#39;t have ice box like being a little
instead they have these patches on their
back organs underneath their carapace
that are adapted for detecting very thin
source of light so they have no optics
they have a whole lot of rhodopsin it&#39;s
a big expanded I derived from a normal
shrimp I but design for detecting good
light what kind of did like to be down
there we thought about it and we thought
that well black smoker chimneys 350
degrees Celsius what the temperature
comes out at hot things though I
sometimes think very simply hot things
slow maybe these below and we were able
to go down with a this is quite a while
ago now at the time was a very sensitive
camera like what you have in your cell
phones now you kill phones probably
better than what we use this is a
picture taken of a black smoker with
flashlights then we turned out the
lights on the submarine and took a
picture this is ambient light on the sea
floor so there is light on the sea floor
its life in the deep ocean and we think
the shrimp are using this light to
navigate black smokers also have the
minerals have deposited around black
smokers in some geological settings
these deposits can accumulate so they
become large enough to be of interest
for mining and Jews were and he was
present he said in the ocean depths
their minds of zinc iron silver and gold
which would be quite easy to exploit and
that&#39;s where we&#39;re at now is thinking
about how to exploit minerals on the
seafloor these minerals including
minerals from these hot springs on the
seafloor we have to think about this we
like our technology we&#39;re very metal
driven society no matter where you are
we need metals and that&#39;s going to be
true into the foreseeable future so how
do we have any service that supply the
quality of the ores are degrading on
land because they&#39;ve been used and the
orders in the deep ocean may be good
maybe height pretty high so I should
show you what one deposit looks like on
the seafloor the tag noun it&#39;s in
international waters it&#39;s under the
jurisdiction of the International seabed
Authority which is making currently
writing up the regulations for seabed
mining and
our mental management of mining it&#39;s an
organization set up to facilitate mining
at the same time that is to protect and
preserve the marine environment so we&#39;ll
take a look at the tag now this is
exactly the place where the swarming
shrimp were first discovered this is
that 3,600 metres if we look at it in
map view look at it the symmetry it
looks like a little sticky bun on the
seafloor and terms of dimension it&#39;s
small hydrothermal vents are not big
places this is only about to the size of
two football fields in diameter it&#39;s
basically a lens with sulfide mental
this is what the miners want to go after
when they talk about going after the
seafloor massive sulphides these kinds
of systems occur on land they&#39;ve been
brought up from the seabed and to land
so this kid creek mine is a is a
hydrothermal vent deposit so when you
think about mining on the seafloor you
can get this picture you don&#39;t have all
those land-based super infrastructure
this is all going to be done by a ship
but you have this big hole in the ground
it&#39;s open open cut mining basically in
the southwest Pacific Nautilus Minerals
ISM mining company first mover company
they are a canadian company working out
of brisbane planning to mine in the
waters of Papua New Guinea they have a
number of leaf sizes exploration leases
that&#39;s what you see in this slide and
they currently have a mining leash that
they received in 2011 from the
government of Papua New Guinea to mine
the Saguaro on hydrothermal vents site
so I&#39;ll run that Saguaro means salt
water in Pigeon so the solara one is
slated for mining they hope to be mining
there in 2018 the first half of 2018
just a couple of years from now here&#39;s
what how they plan to do it this is
their vision they have a surface mining
vessel and they lower our ovies remotely
operate remotely operated vehicles to
the seabed those mining tools their
money to overawe Roby&#39;s they chunk up
the sea floor grind it up send the
material up through a rising Worcester
system to the ship the material gets be
watered that d-ward materials filtered
and sent back down to the student the
machines are baked they&#39;re already
constructed
and like I said they&#39;ll be going into
the water hopefully well hopefully from
mullahs view and 2018 the picture you
saw the mine site shows it looks kind of
like a desert right but in fact your
animals that live there on the fifa
online hydrothermal vent chimney for
their sales and barnacles crabs or the
whole bacteria from the bacteria all the
way up to the pup consumers so knowledge
minerals and the other mining industries
come to the science scientists and say
well how do we think about this how do
we do the environmental management many
kinds of systems and we&#39;ve been helping
them about that and some of the things
we have to think about our you know
scientists we don&#39;t want to advocate for
or against mining but we want if mining
is going to take place let me have to
figure out how can they do it best so we
think about where the protected area
should be that makes sense that our
strategic and allow the organisms to
persist we think about what kind of
baseline date is you have to collect
beforehand we think about what kind of
modern monitoring do you do what&#39;s a
significant adverse impact how do you
define that so all the kinds of legal
and environmental management concepts
you need we think about how do you
mitigate what are one of the ways to
minimize the damage of mining and even
more challenging to think about is how
would you possibly restore something
with a mile mile and a half two miles
three miles down in the ocean very
challenging very intellectually rich but
challenging and yes interesting area to
work so I&#39;ve talked to you a little bit
about the scientific value of these
seafloor massive sulphides and hot
springs I&#39;ve taught you a little bit
about the commercial value and I wanted
to just bring in the ideas how we think
about the deep sea and the cultural
construction of aesthetic value in the
deep sea it&#39;s up to us to make these
systems valued if it just doesn&#39;t happen
it&#39;s not an innate character of
assistance it&#39;s human values that need
to be placed on them I had a student who
thought about this looking at texts from
medias de versus BuzzFeed all the way up
to New York up Isis citizen
imposing my opinions but including the
New York Times and the words that kept
up the emotive words that were repeated
over and over again we&#39;re aliens strange
unknown in mysterious this is how we
think of a deep sea and then the artwork
that goes along with this is cultural
construction we often see the lantern
fish that Ben are so strange and eerie
or here&#39;s another picture them going
after the rubber ducks its own water the
woodcuts here&#39;s a different way of
looking at organisms on the seafloor
face painting as a way to bring
awareness to what&#39;s going on in the in
the deep sea this is in the case of
people are trawling the last example I
want to give you is of a the Yeti crab
this has become an icon of the deep sea
it was actually discovered on a Alvin
died that I leg and I didn&#39;t discover
this crab my colleague Michel say comes
back on the dives discovered it found it
made sure we collected it brought it up
it became it&#39;s a new family of crowns
and it has become a really special
animal in the deep sea world this is
some rather menacing perspective
interpretation of this craft by Lily
Simonson very very well known oil
painter and then in another extreme they
have been turned into a little plush
stuffed animals that kind of want to put
around your neck when you&#39;re on the
airplane find it get a nap so I just
want to close I have two things I wanted
to close with the first is that these
are trilobite they&#39;re probably not going
to be trial about alive on the people
they&#39;ve been extinct for hundreds of
millions of years but they capture for
me the idea that we don&#39;t know what
we&#39;re going to find it we have not
explored all the oceans by any means and
there&#39;s many amazing things out there to
be discovered if it&#39;s not a trial about
it maybe something else really really
strange and wonderful and then the
second thing is we as a society make
shoes to exploit minerals on the sea
floor but it&#39;s also then our
responsibility if we do that it&#39;s our
responsibility to understand what we
will lose as well as what we will gain
thank you
