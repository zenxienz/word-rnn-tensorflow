so I&#39;m an artist then I worked in
technology and I have a project I&#39;m
going to show you today that combines my
love for science hip-hop and design I
want to check by the way to any tech
guys in the house yes the project is
called the rap Almanac and if the
database that analyzes the language in
hip-hop there are 50,000 songs lyrics
33,000 rs.5000 album and but search
looks like chips you type in the word
understand in this case power press
return and you get back to results for
every song in the database that uses
that word power and we&#39;re in the song
the word is used and the other data
associated with each song are of course
artist named song title from release
date and geolocation or two that are
really important and they&#39;ll come into
play later on so these are some analyses
of rappers and their songs and there was
scored based on how important those
scores related to the data so this is
the first time that the content of
hip-hop is compared with the location of
hip-hop and the time in hip-hop and it
gives the different context for the
culture of hip-hop and you can do really
fun things once it pop is in data form
and this is an example of mapping the
language in hip-hop so this is a google
map of all the Staten Island rappers so
where they all live it when I first put
the data into matt form I got to see
around the planet where each rapper
lives and what the places that each
rapper raps about
another project I did with the data was
look at the most popular champagne brand
mentions from 1982 2010 and I dip on the
chart right here you see is when jay-z
had it falling out with Chris tile and
pretty much dead at krystals popularity
in hip-hop this project is looking at
the 50 cent in his career and each line
represents a song and it and the
analysis takes the song through
different parallel coordinates and this
is a project is the text correlation
between jay-z and nods when they had a
rap battle so the lyrics on on the left
are jay-z&#39;s others on the right or
nozzles and the words that they share
the diss each other or right down the
middle so in short the project
visualizes hip hop lyrics as a cultural
indicator meaning how does hip-hop
influence the world and how does the
world influence hip-hop how does it show
up in hip-hop so while I was working on
this I didn&#39;t know but there was a
bigger place at Harvard called the
hip-hop archives and I was working on
projects posted them to my website and
the director emailed me and invited me
to come in and continue and continue my
work so I did so and I was also invited
to go to Carnegie Mellon to add some
more analysis to the for the database
but I also wanted to make some art from
the from the data and in particular I
wanted to make some something sculptural
and I didn&#39;t have an idea really what I
was going to do when I got there but I
took a tour of the facility and saw this
15-foot robot arm and I was like
whatever I&#39;m going to do I&#39;m going to do
with that
so while at Carnegie Mellon I added more
analysis to the database and this is
actually what it looks like to analyze a
song in the case this is actually Drake
entire musical career and you can see
stuff like locations like cities in here
whether or not the song is negative or
positive and the words that they use the
most are highlighted in this analysis so
data is cool spreadsheets are cool but
not that fun to look at all the time so
I wanted to make images from this so and
and basically Zeta needs memory Dana
needs experience data needs an
experience to be able to tell a story so
in experience I had when I was about you
guys age was looking at this Pablo
Picasso light pen drawings where he took
a light pen and made drawings on on
photographs so what I did was put a
light pin in the robot arm and I plotted
all of the locations in an artist career
around the globe and this is what it
looks like this is Kanye West map so
from Kanye&#39;s first song to his last one
all of the locations he raps about are
plotted this is what looks like this is
Drake
kendrick lamar not and this is all 12
artists so finishing that residency I
came back to New York and open up a
school a rat research lab where this
past summer I did a pilot class with six
of my students and the upper right and I
showed them how to do data analysis data
visualization and we and they worked on
their own research projects and the
research process is really cool and they
made a tumblr that has their research
and their research projects one of them
one student emanuel looked at crimes
that were wrapped about the number of
crimes that were wrapped about over one
period and then compared them where
actual crime rates reported for that
same period and he found that when wrap
wrapped about crimes a lot the actual
crimes that were happening warrant was
it wasn&#39;t matching up they were lower so
i&#39;m going to invite all of you guys to
apply to the rat research lab come join
us and analyzing hip-hop music and
culture thank you
[Applause]
