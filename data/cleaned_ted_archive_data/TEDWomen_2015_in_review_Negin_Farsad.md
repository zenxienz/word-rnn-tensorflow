hi hey guys uh you know that feeling of
like joy and gratitude that you have
liked from the last poet I&#39;m here to
take a dump on that feeling okay um this
has been such an amazing conference
hasn&#39;t this been amazing
such a wonderful time this year&#39;s a
theme it was a momentum there was
actually a there was a second theme that
they had going that they scrapped the
original theme was actually textures
eating food off of sticks and oddly
shaped small containers plus there&#39;s a
robotic petting zoo they scrapped that
title is a little clunky uh but you know
when the Commons like this where there&#39;s
just only women some things come up some
interesting things come up like there
was a really long line for the bathrooms
on that first day they&#39;re not enough
bathrooms and I thought you know I&#39;ll
just sneak into the men&#39;s bathroom but I
didn&#39;t want to be the one person to run
into Jimmy Carter when he&#39;s in the
bathroom I didn&#39;t want to be that guy I
be Jimmy Carter in there plus the white
topia dude being like Jimmy Carter where
do you live I want to come live with you
Plus that male feminist guy being like
listen you guys should really divide
your chores it relates to better
outcomes I didn&#39;t want to see that by
the way we learned from rich Benjamin
that that playing poker fishing golfing
these are all a very serious academic
study yeah so the rest of you scholars
have totally been doing it wrong me to
be devising your your research in the
South of France where you can go
wine-tasting into the beach that&#39;s what
you guys should be doing it by the way
rich uh get out of white topia it is not
safe for you there what are you doing
how do you not see in the virtual
reality journalism of no need Ella pay
by the way I love that no needle up Enya
and her virtual reality journalism is
basically saying that print journalism
is dead
and that we&#39;re gonna all stop reading
all together so that&#39;s what I took away
from that um but what really got to me
was was that was Sakina yacouba&#39;s talk
seconds
Sakina yaqoob&#39; as a afghan education
rights activist she is the woman who
basically played mind games with the
Taliban
with the Taliban and one
yeah that was like a typical Tuesday for
her you know tell me I saw a bunch of
rifles you know what a typical Tuesday
is for me I construct four to seven very
clever tweets so medium Sakina are the
same we&#39;re the same
I actually do have some things in common
with sakinah&#39;s and iranian-american I
were both Muslim we both speak Farsi and
despite any kind of accomplishment that
we might have in life we will both still
disappoint our parents because they
wanted us to be engineers mostly you
mostly love you oh you&#39;re great and
that&#39;s you know this was such a touching
talking and that&#39;s really one of the
hallmarks of Ted is that there is
touching talk after touching talk you&#39;re
gonna cop cry 16 to 22 times before

10:00 a.m. and then you&#39;re gonna stand
up and do your standing ovation right so
you&#39;re basically you you cry you stand
you clap you squat you cry Stan clap
squat stand

claps 1:20 sound like one of the poets
from yesterday cry stay
that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to learn
another main hallmark of a TED
conferences that you always have to have
a white lady singing a Chinese mountain
song
at itok
they followed all the rules there
um there was so much amazing technology
on display at his TED conference wasn&#39;t
there&#39;s so much amazing technology Robin
Murphy wants us to use robots in
disaster zones and by the way this is
this is an image of her with an heir an
unmanned aerial robot and for anyone on
the Obama camp who might be watching
they look a lot like drones but instead
of killing people they actually save
people so that&#39;s just wanted to make
that distinction who she got political I
did Ronna I&#39;ll tell you me is making
complete our computers read our emotions
um she actually gave us some really
fantastic statistics apparently women in
the u.s. smile 40% more than men but
women in the u.s. also make 23 percent
less than men so while we&#39;re making less
money we hide our rage behind a
beautifully crafted
this is great you know quality is great
but this technology you know is really
exciting I think what we&#39;re good what&#39;s
gonna happen is we&#39;re gonna hear a lot
more arguments where women are saying
how can you not understand how I feel
okay turn on the app so you can
understand how I feel I was actually
able to get some data from Rana that she
did not share with you less yesterday
here are some things that your computer
of the top three things that they have
found that your computer&#39;s likely to say
to you you you need an app you look like
 you&#39;ve been on Facebook for the
last five hours do you know where your
child is
maybe you should finish on this cry in
the bathroom entire looking at your face
christena mark condo is pissed because
men have pockets to put their devices in
and waiting dogs and so forth of course
at first I thought she was going to
unveil some kind of bioengineering of
like a kangaroo pouch on all women
because it&#39;s Ted like that would be
normal but um turns out she&#39;s actually
making advancements in wearable
technology her company is called
Ringling by the way um the that name
narrowly beat out the other name they
were looking at which was you Apple
watch
if anyone from Apple is here I totally
still want an Apple watch just so you
know
come on a pink one okay um I was really
excited with this technology but I think
I&#39;m gonna wait for the next version of
ringly the nipple ring Lee you suck the
technology&#39;s supposed to disappear so
hey
says to disappear speaking of nipples oh
there was I did that Segway bitches yeah
speaking of nipples there was a lot of
cata talk about relationships throughout
this conference which was really
exciting for example Maria Bello she
started out by telling us that 50% of
the audience is in a committed
relationship and the other 50% have
Netflix so sorry about that but what I
really like the thing I really got most
from her talk was the many many many
people who have fallen in love with her
this is like a terrible conference to be
single at when you&#39;re a heterosexual
women oh sorry I didn&#39;t mean to label
myself
I didn&#39;t mean to label myself just
disregard that you know what I was
supposed to do that so you could see who
was talking about you know what I mean

because I wrote this talk at 2:00 a.m.
so this is all a disaster okay but I
think the most sexually explicit talk of
the entire conference came from Marlene
Zuk and evolutionary biologist
she&#39;s also Ted&#39;s
in-house insect pornographer
Marlene Marlene says sexing insects is
more interesting than sexing people
about Marlene um you clearly have never
seen me have sex so I think I keep
things very interesting I occasionally
go on top and I almost always take off
my socks so and they&#39;re very interesting
sexy times but there there are also
women making other advancements and
understanding nature come on Kai Kani
curtisha is figuring out how marine life
interacts with the water by studying
their hydrodynamic signature and the
great thing about the hydrodynamic
signature is pretending to understand
the term hydrodynamic signature
researchers
matera Monaco is a bunch of pretenders
and a Chania eg choppa by the way who&#39;s
killing on the name pronunciation
if I mess up anyone&#39;s name there&#39;s that
golden rule that an ethnic person can
mess up the name of another ethnic
person so get off my back you know what
I mean but attenuated Shaba is is
battling the water hyacinth which is an
invasive aquatic weed so basically what
she&#39;s doing is she&#39;s harvesting the
water hyacinth drying it out and then
weaving it into like beautiful
decorative objects now my question for a
channel is can you do this with other
invasive things like guns or or like
assholes
can you please figure that out Ateneo
we&#39;re really counting on you so
Elizabeth Naima yarrow is trying to get
men to fight for equality for women and
girls with her he for she campaign and I
actually I want to tell you guys I&#39;m
actually launching my own campaign it&#39;s
a it&#39;s called the he for brie campaign
it&#39;s some people standing up for the
rights and the deliciousness of brie
cheese I&#39;m launching it in my kitchen
and so far we have thousands of crackers
that have signed up in solidarity with
brie cheese so you&#39;re not change in the
world launching my own campaign that is
the dumbest joke I&#39;ve ever written
I couldn&#39;t cut it out so stupid he for
Bri all right hey myself love myself
memory Banda is
she&#39;s definitely gonna end up merging
when she&#39;s done with that I would like
to suggest her maybe going to prom or
catching a One Direction concert or
something just to take a break because
what are you doing you&#39;re a kid okay
this is ridiculous
Emma was really it really kind of
another hallmark of a TED conference is
that you&#39;re walking among Giants people
like Oh Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda and
Billy gene kami before
there would be no in swimming sports
there would be no Venus and Serena
making orgasm sounds on the tennis court
that would be there would be none of
that you know you guys don&#39;t know this
but when she got off the stage she went
backstage and fought and wrestled a
tiger to the ground that&#39;s how I don&#39;t
know why Ted allows Tigers backstage
it&#39;s just a weird quirk Junko and talk
about it but uh um but I these women are
so impressive I had a really and the
thing is like you&#39;re in the space with
them right so you never know like you
could be you could meet one of these
ladies and I had the honor of walking
behind Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin and I
was talking to my friend about the
vitamins that came in the gift bag what
up Jo gummies okay and and I was like oh
I&#39;m really excited about the vitamins in
the gift bag and Jane Fonda turns around
and she said you know you have to take
six doses of that that&#39;s the math that
you have to take and I was like huh I
don&#39;t know if you guys have ever been in
conversation where Jane Fonda tells you
how many vitamins to take I don&#39;t know
what brilliant comeback you guys have
created for that
because I was like oh my god Jane Fonda
first of all she reads the back of
bottles I never do that I should be like
more like Jane Thailand I just done been
silent so it was one of my more eloquent
moments here at 10 among Giants but you
know we just saw so many former
presidents yeah there was just like how
many presidents can one kind of print a
no they were just roaming around just
like being presidential and I was like
okay how many Jesus there should be some
kind of cap on that uh who is
programming this thing but we got some
some great exemplars of just women just
for granted being women people like
Margaret Heffernan is a she&#39;s a business
Margaret ISM is a is a business mogul
and she&#39;s trying to build social capital
with employees and she talked about how
in Sweden they&#39;re they&#39;re building
social capital through something called
thinka which means which means coffee
break and/or IKEA side table you learn
that from Margaret um Roxane gay who
does not love
we deserve the same opportunities as men
that women are equal to men and they
deserve to live a life free of
catcalling unless of course catcalling
is where you get your self-esteem in
which case it&#39;s totally fine but she&#39;s a
really bad feminist like she isn&#39;t it by
the way she wasn&#39;t able to be here today
and but literally she told me she wants
you guys to know that she knows that you
guys all think that she has a great rack
that&#39;s uh
that is what Roxane gay told me to tell
if you&#39;ve no joke she&#39;s a bad like she&#39;s
a bad feminist okay but make sure you
watch that game Margot have Margaret
Heaven and we can be average chickens
that watch Real Housewives follow the
Bible of Beyonce and eat Funyuns and
retracted novels and we&#39;re still
feminists
thank God for that well by the way God
is still a man so sorry about that
that&#39;s not that hasn&#39;t changed
God is still a man so I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m
gonna just uh I&#39;m gonna close it up here
this has been such a wonderful
experience I&#39;m so honored to have been
here and I&#39;m so honored to be a part of
the test bellows program and and you
know what I just want to share an
inspirational word from my mother and
you know what why don&#39;t we all join
hands let&#39;s just join hands let&#39;s have
that this is my mom okay
let&#39;s just all join hands and uh and I&#39;m
