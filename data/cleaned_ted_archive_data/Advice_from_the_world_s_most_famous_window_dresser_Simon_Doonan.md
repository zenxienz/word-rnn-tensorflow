an organic pickle maker a fluffer in a
strip club and okay a sustainable and
sustainable goat herder a transgender
ventriloquist certain professions are so
freaky and marginal that they sound more
like the punchline of a Monty Python
sketch tonight I&#39;m going to prove to you
unequivocably and joyfully that the real
opportunities today lie in these freaky
marginal areas were areas where you&#39;ve
never looked the dusty corners of the
world that is where you should be
looking if you want creative
satisfaction and a groovy job I should
know because I am drumroll the world&#39;s
most famous window dresser oh yeah let&#39;s
talk about window dressing for a moment
now window dresser is one of those
stigmatized professions that if it
showed up on your child&#39;s what I want to
do when I grow up list you would
probably drag him to a psychiatrist and
you know have him severely inspected but
I&#39;m here to tell you that the reality is
very different now how did I get started
in this field I got started in this
field when I left college my mother said
to me you need to get a job so I did the
obvious thing I got a job demolishing
public toilets yes it was every bit as
disgusting and horrible as it sounds and
on the third week I got fired and I was
walking home as the dusty little
department store in my little town and I
thought that is more moi working in the
store right so I went in and I got a job
selling clocks and watches and there was
a recession at the time so there were no
customers so all I had to do was like
dust these clocks and
and eventually I got bored and I thought
goodness me the window display people
are having so much more fun than I am so
I clawed begged my way into an
entry-level job in the display
department and you know I was happy to
be surrounded by kindred spirits to be
in this freaky little display studio I
never imagined it would take me catapult
me across the Atlantic win me a shelf
full of awards and bring me all this
creative satisfaction okay so once I got
the lay of the land I looked around I
thought goodness me these displays are
so boring and so tragic that it&#39;s
frightening you know the kind of broken
finger on the mannequin a wig on
sideways so I thought this profession is
right for reinvention right for
reinvention so I made a list of all the
taboo busting freaky ass things that
have never been done in a window and I
did them beginning with the next slide
oh yeah there it is oh god see now I&#39;ve
got go back go back because that&#39;s
important so this is a good example
coyote abductions you know no one ever
did that in a window so I did all these
horrifying things mannequins and coffins
people hanging themselves you know I put
stuffed rats in windows with little you
know Dicky bow ties on like anything
obnoxious and appalling that had never
been done in a window I did it and they
got a lot of notoriety for it I also I
also yes toilets from the wrecking yard
for no reason I also I won&#39;t say that
again yes celebrity caricatures that was
one of my signature moves to start in
the 80s before celebrity culture sort of
comeback I start thinking how people are
starting to talk about celebrities again
so they didn&#39;t in the seven
so in the 80s people getting more
excited about so the release Prince
hello little red Corvette Madonna the
mesmerizing mistress of perpetual
reinvention dyeing her hair again Madge
again in her goatee a pointy poor outfit
so the Queen with a fire extinguisher
between her legs because it was that
year that Windsor Castle burnt down so
here I am busting taboos in this freaky
ass marginal much reviled profession and
oh I am the only person ever to have put
Margaret Thatcher in a dominatrix outfit
the Iron Lady the Iron Lady in a dungeon
ironing etc so the other thing my other
big claim to fame is that I invented the
messy window the disgusting messy window
full of cigarette butts it&#39;s such a et
cetera running out of time so your
takeaway from all this what is your
takeaway from all this good question
your takeaway is that the the freaky
marginal nooks and crannies of the world
that is where you&#39;re gonna get creative
opportunities not by becoming a hedge
funder or become joining the NFL or
becoming the next JC you&#39;re going to
find freaky interesting mind expanding
creatively fulfilling work in the
freakiest nooks and crannies of the
world thank you
