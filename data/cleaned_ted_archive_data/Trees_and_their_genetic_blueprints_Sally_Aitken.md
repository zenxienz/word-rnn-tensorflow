so I have a confession to make I love
trees and I kill them
I&#39;ve probably killed ten thousand tens
of thousands of trees in the last decade
but that&#39;s not nearly as many as climate
change related causes have already
killed things like insect and disease
outbreaks and droughts so I study
conifers and conifers are ancient trees
that ancient species that live on earth
cover huge areas and they&#39;ve been around
for hundreds of millions of years now
they continue to provide us with a lot
of things they provide us with clean air
clean water habitat for many species and
they also provide us with the wood and
paper we use every day now how have
these species lived for so long on the
face of the earth well the environment
has always changed over time and trees
have had to deal with that and they&#39;ve
dealt with this in two ways that they&#39;ve
had to migrate or adapt
now trees have had to migrate great
distances but this is a very slow
process after the last ice age trees
were able to migrate about a hundred
yards per year but to keep up with the
current rate of human-caused climate
change they would have to migrate
several miles per year now they can also
adapt as some trees successfully live
and reproduce and others die but that
process of evolution through natural
selection takes quite a while so the
trees of any given species have
different genetic blueprints depending
on where they live and that reflects the
climates that they&#39;re adapted to so for
example these are Sitka spruce and we
collected seed from California to Alaska
and we planted those seeds all together
in an experiment and so the growth that
you see here reflects largely their
genetics because they&#39;re the same age
they grew in the same environment and
you see huge differences among them the
trees from Alaska are tiny but tough
they grow for only a very short period
of time because they&#39;re adapted to a
short summer the trees from California
they grow and grow and they tower over
there Alaska neighbors because they can
are adapted to a long summer now if you
were to take a tree from California and
plant it in Alaska it wouldn&#39;t do any
better than if you took a California and
dressed for California and put them in
an Alaska winter so these populations
they have home-field advantage just like
a sports team the local the locally
adapted material has historically done
best in that place but as climates
change home-field advantage no longer
works so how can we use this natural
genetic diversity to help for us adapt
to climate change
well we plant in the US and in Canada
over three billion trees every year and
people decide what to plant where so if
we can better understand this adaptation
to climate we can change what we plant
where so we study the characteristics of
trees that help them deal with their
climate and you may not think of trees
as growing very quickly but these are
lodgepole pine and if you watch them
here we measure their growth when they
start growing when they stop growing how
much they grow and we relate that to the
environments that they come from but we
also establish some big experiments
where we torture them in various ways we
expose them to a heat waves droughts
freezing temperatures and this work
requires a lot of people power
particularly student power it&#39;s very
labor intensive but what if we could
look directly at the genes that affect
those traits and affect adaptation to
climate
well conifers have obese genomes they
have about seven times as
much DNA as in every cell as you or me
and the genes make up less than 1% of
that DNA so can we go in and grab the
jeans and just sequence those now 10
years ago 20 years ago this was
impossible but new genomic technologies
allow us to go in pull out the genes and
sequence those and then we can search
for the ones that are related to climate
and through this process we have
generated enormous datasets for example
we have sequence over four trillion DNA
letters in pines and in spruces from
different locations across species
ranges and if we were to print that data
out we would have a stack of paper 200
times taller than the Empire State
Building
so we don&#39;t print it but we do require
supercomputer computing clusters to
analyze the data and what do we look for
well what we look for is patterns
patterns in the variation we have
identified millions of locations within
those genomes that vary some individuals
have one letter some have another in
those places and what we do is we look
at the traits related to climate we look
at the traits related to climate we look
at the climates themselves and we lay
those patterns together with the genes
and we look for those genes that affect
adaptation to climate and we can use
that information to better choose trees
to plant for new environments we can
also increase the genetic diversity and
the species diversity of what we plant
to add resilience to the system so
scientists are looking for solutions to
slow the effects of climate change on
natural biological systems and genetic
diversity plays a major role in that
search thank you

hello
so in January today she retired and
Dylan unfortunately she has retire too
so I am in there serve in their place
today I have a quick question in your
studies which species of trees was the
most interesting well it&#39;s hard to have
a favorite species I work on about ten
of them but the one that&#39;s probably
closest to my heart is the whitebark
pine and this is a species that only
occurs at very high elevations and the
only way it disperses its seed is with a
bird called the Clarks Nutcracker the
other interesting thing about it is the
seeds are a major food source for
grizzly bears so when those trees can&#39;t
produce seed the Grizzlies don&#39;t do as
well in places like Yellowstone so it&#39;s
a beautiful tree it&#39;s in the mountains
and it has to be my favorite all right
thank you
