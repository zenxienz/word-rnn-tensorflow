all righty everyone so let&#39;s have some
fun
everyone in this room has a name and our
names represent our identity our
cultural origins history and I believe
our worldview and future so my name is
Eric antibiotic udo and i run an
international network called kin it
enables every single one of you in this
room to access the people and
information and resources you need at
any given point of time around the world
but I&#39;m not here to talk about that I&#39;m
here to talk about the names behind the
people of this network every single day
I interact with amazing young people and
other seasoned folks just like you all
and I want you to know about yarmulke so
your Mecca is like many of us young
Nigerians puzzling in in Lagos trying to
overcome hardships here but make
something not only for ourselves but for
the country of the whole yamakasi she
does two things here one is she helps
local business owners early-stage tech
startups achieve high growth so that
they&#39;re primed and ready to compete
globally additionally she Shepherds in
to the Lagos tech ecosystem
international investors so why so that
we could have a prime opportunity for
foreign and foreign investment but I
want to share with you all
Yumiko story around her name and what it
means to her please show the video I
don&#39;t want you to come whenever I say oh
my name is give it up someone always
said people are thinking that I&#39;ll be
okay because we know that we name our
soldiers you know
so there&#39;s a real strength in knowing
your identity your name is specific Aria
and it be honest and your name and your
roots and your heritage on your altar is
so so vital to becoming a success worse
than ever we understand confidence in
yourself and your ability and where to
come from then precise accuracy so I
personally agree significantly with
yarmulkes points having the confidence
to understand your roots your heritage
and allowing that to spearhead the work
that you do and the impact that you make
your makan I also spoke more about
candid realities here in Lagos Nigeria
but she mentioned her name the one that
means victory that surrounds her gives
her the audacity and the energy to power
through why because her purpose is to
make these young entrepreneurs and early
stage business owners right for who the
international investors that she&#39;s
shepherding to Lagos to drive foreign
investment into this country which I
doubt anyone here would disagree that we
need but to have confidence in your name
it&#39;s somewhat of a journey she attested
to that but I can as well so maybe you
can tell by my accent I was raised in
the United States and some of you may or
may not know this but growing up in the
u.s. California - the exact being
African wasn&#39;t exactly cool the kids
didn&#39;t get it and so my name stood out
it wasn&#39;t always accepted
additionally teachers and colleagues
would pass over my name because it was
too difficult to pronounce
they call me abbreviations letters
alphabets different letters of the
alphabet but never my full name that
makes an impact on you
in many cases I contemplate it should I
change my name
should I abbreviate it to make it more
convenient or to assimilate but even
here in Nigeria my name is often debated
my lovely taxi drivers I tell them my
name is Eric n Missa ah Erica you are
Mary Cana
nofa I am Nigerian or say my name is
Obata - kudos and they tell me oh you
are Congolese I say no sir I&#39;m from a
Craven state but I understand that some
of you all may have had some interesting
pivot
journeys with your own name and you
contemplate these similar questions
maybe even someone&#39;s pronounce pronounce
your name or misspelled your name and
you question if it worth it to correct
them should I assert myself in this
moment if I change my name will I get
this job but I&#39;ve chosen to get in front
of it it took some time as I mentioned
earlier and so today I use my name as a
conversation starter an entry point into
the world that is Who I am my name is
Eric n and it means victory comes from
God a boat Takuto is my last name o boat
at Duke and odo those are the first
three families in my lineage my
ancestors and my name traces me back to
this beautiful continent of Africa and
Nigeria the e BB o people of southern
Nigeria put it all together put it all
together and my name is my anthem
victory comes from God it&#39;s my family
tree or both at guro and together
it&#39;s my compass if I ever get lost my
name will lead me back home
so by default that&#39;s being here in this
room means that we have ambition
we have tenacity we have the ability to
see into the future see how we can
imprint ourselves take ownership of what
we offer and by doing so undoubtedly we
will have a tremendous impact on the
next ten maybe fifteen and a hundred
years here in Nigeria but guess what
also across Africa and also globally so
as such my beautiful brethren for us
with our names let&#39;s get excited about
them because guess what the common names
that we know today need to move over
because there&#39;s a new emergence of
common names and they are your names
Jenna do Amica Babatunde Selassie jolly
cast by looking into your name and to
those of others around you you&#39;re
accepting your future as we guide you
through that destiny thank you everyone
[Applause]
