so hello everyone we started the day in
outer space and we are going to end the
day in outer space pretty cool right
yeah there we go how many of you have
seen this photo before lots right so it
was taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts
over 45 years ago and many people credit
this photo in part with sparking the
environmental movement why why was it a
spark it&#39;s because it highlights how the
earth is fragile and it highlights how
the earth is special this world teeming
with life with oceans with weather why
did our planet come to be this way but
other planets did not they&#39;re dull
they&#39;re lifeless like the moon so
fortunately as a planetary geologist my
students and I get to think about this
question and we think about it in part
how do planets work how did this sustain
life through time we think about this in
the context of thinking about other
planets to like Mars so who knows that
Mars today is really cold and really dry
yeah yeah a few Mars a file well it is
the temperature only barely gets above
freezing and the lowest temperatures are
over a hundred degrees below zero but
this picture shows that Mars probably
once had liquid water and it probably
once had an ocean this is a topographic
map of Mars and we&#39;re peering down into
the northern lowlands we&#39;ve learned over
the last decade of exploration that
actually during the first billion years
of its history Mars had rivers and lakes
it had soil forming from water trickling
through the rocks there were
hydrothermal systems circulating in the
subsurface and there were there were
lakes that evaporated and left behind a
bathtub ring of salt
so what happens to Mars why did this
once water rich planet transition into
the cold and dry world that we see today
and could there possibly have ever been
life that form during that first water
rich period so we get a few shots to go
down to the ground and explore these
questions so this is Dale crater and
some of you may know that this is the
current home of the Curiosity rover Gale
Crater is a hundred and fifty kilometers
and it has a mountain in it that&#39;s
taller than the tallest mountain in the
continental United States so we wanted
to go and we wanted to go to this crater
because we wanted to look at the record
of its rocks so when you think about the
Grand Canyon right you think about
layers of rocks and you know that
geologists like the Grand Canyon you
might like the Grand Canyon but we like
it as geologists so much because each
layer of those rocks records a history
of the environment that was once there
so you hike down the Grand Canyon you&#39;re
hiking older in time you&#39;re reading the
record from the rocks similarly this is
what we can do at Gale Crater except in
this direction we&#39;re going up we&#39;re
starting with the oldest rocks we&#39;re
working our way up up through them to
see what they tell us here&#39;s another
close-up view the closest we were able
to get from orbit and you can see these
ledges each of these rock layers has a
particular story to tell us now you
might remember two years ago did any of
you watch the landing on until on the
web streaming it yeah a few of you out
there that was pretty awesome right so
the triumph of engineering the team at
JPL the engineering team landed a
one-ton Rover on the surface of Mars and
if you haven&#39;t seen the web video i
encourage you to google seven minutes of
terror and watch how they did it but for
those of us scientists in the room it
was now time to get to work because once
we landed our destination was in front
of us mount sharp the mountain we were
going to climb to determine the
environmental history of Mars
and it was beautiful from the surface so
this is a postcard it is an image taken
from the surface of Mars by the rover
and you can see the beautiful rock
layers in the mountain ahead of us for
exploration now there was a long journey
ahead of us though before we would get
to those rock layers because where we
landed up there we had to actually go
around a pile of sand dunes that were
really really high like like way above
my head high that would cause the rover
to fall over if the rover tried to drive
over them so we had about a 15 kilometer
trek ahead of us when we landed it was
kind of cool because we have orbiters
around Mars too and we could see exactly
where we had landed which was in the
middle of that black spot and then we
can see all the pieces that delivered us
to the surface the heat shield the
backshell the parachute and we could
also see that our landing had blown away
the dust to reveal rocks just around the
rover now anyone in the room thinks
about geology or is curious about what&#39;s
going on your attention might
immediately be drawn right here to this
contact between three different units of
rocks what that says there&#39;s three
different environments there to explore
so even though Mount sharp to go there
to start our 15 kilometer drive we&#39;re
supposed to go south which way did the
rover go yeah the river went there we
wanted to check out these cool light
tone layered rocks and it was it&#39;s been
an amazing journey ever since the last
two years so we started out by checking
out those patches where our rockets that
had delivered us to the surface blew
away the dust so we went to the the one
over to the left and what we saw when we
got there were these crumbling rocks
that look like they were cemented
together we took a closer look and we
saw that those cemented rocks were
actually rounded how do rocks become
rounded when you just break a rock right
oh I heard someone say it oh when you
just break a rock right it shatters into
all these fragments it requires water
tumbling tumbling tumbling to wear down
the edges to form to form these rounded
rocks so conglomerate is the name of the
rock
and on Mars as well as earth they formed
from water that was the first of the
water discoveries but it was not the
last because then we kept driving and we
got to these light tone layers that we
had seen from orbit and wanted to
investigate so we extended the rover arm
out with its microscopic imager and
chemical instruments and we also drilled
the hole scooped up some materials and
stuck it in the laboratory instruments
that the rover carries in its belly and
when we did that we found out a few
things we took a look down the hole and
we saw when we shut the hole with the
laser do you see these these these dots
going down yeah the drill didn&#39;t make
that the rover carries a laser that
analyzes chemistry by shooting Mars
materials at a distance of up to about
seven meters away so yes we have a laser
beam on Mars and it told us that this
rock was was was was full of clay
minerals and you can actually see the
veins of salt right from from the lake
waters that were once they are
evaporating so there was an amazing
water story in it and it showed that
that channels brought waters down off
the crater rim they ponded tumbling
rounding roxas they went then pond into
formal lake and we can all tell this is
geologists just by looking at the shape
and the composition of rocks so having
made those discoveries which is pretty
awesome we still had our 15 kilometer
journey ahead and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been
doing for most of the last year and a
half is trekking slowly the rover goes
slowly the rover driving seat is like
this so it takes a while to get places
and we&#39;ve had a little bit of challenges
along the way so the rubber wheels
aren&#39;t supposed to have holes this big
in them pointy rocks have been
puncturing our wheels and there&#39;s no
Triple A on Mars so you have to preserve
your wheels and we&#39;ve been adopting the
strategy of driving on loaf and which is
a lot safer gentler on the wheels so at
last so this was only a few weeks ago we
made it to the base of Mount sharp
and you can see the layered rocks
stretching before us we&#39;re working our
way through them now drilling to
understand the chemistry we&#39;ve got about
another three kilometers up the hill of
climbing left to go so pay attention to
this journey the rover is even now
drilling driving drilling driving we
asked earlier today what would you bring
to Mars would you go to Mars well we&#39;ve
already brought our curiosity to Mars
and it is a proxy for us as explorers
until we can make it there one day
ourselves so thank you and follow along
the rover&#39;s adventure
[Applause]
