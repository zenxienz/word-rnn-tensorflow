of all human infectious diseases which
one is the most deadly maybe already
thinking about SAS swine flu Ebola
epidemic that traveled West Africa not
too long ago or even the most recent
Zika infections all these diseases are
standing in common they originated from
animals I work in East Africa as a
veterinarian on diseases that move from
mine was to money and I&#39;ve come across
one that I think is the most arguably
the most deadly rabies it&#39;s caused by a
bullet like virus that is transmitted
between humans and animals through bites
from rabid animals often the domestic
dog once a dog gets the virus man&#39;s best
friend is turned into a ferocious fall
and once you&#39;re beaten the virus starts
moving up the peripheral nervous system
after the brains and once there the
manifestation of the disease begins with
confusion agitation then violence then a
fear of water required to as hydrophobia
you&#39;ll be surprised to know that for a
hundred and twenty years you have had an
effective vaccine against rabies the
question is why do you still have people
dying the horrible terrifying death from
rabies there are three things that are
responsible for this misconceptions and
I want to address them today the first
one is that rape is a small public
health problem every country send their
data on the people that have died from
different diseases to the World Health
Organization the information that goals
they are about Trey be the numbers are
dismal fear of them making it look like
dravus is not a big disease
now we have evidence that those numbers
are up to 200 times less it&#39;s a tip of
the iceberg and the results for that are
many one ribbit infects communities in
marginalized areas where health access
access to health care is actually not
good and because the disease states up
to a month before you can start getting
the manifestation of the science often
the physician and the patient can&#39;t
connect the bite wound that is already
healed the disease that is manifesting
and therefore the end up detailing is
something else and there are many
diseases for instance a labral marilla&#39;s
present in the same way and a lot of the
patients are declared to hassle about
malaria when calculated correctly every
fifty nine thousand people around the
world most of them in Africa in Asia
diaphragm rabies now we put it into
context with a defense that we know
about that&#39;s many times the peak deaths
that are due to other impressions that
grab the world&#39;s attention now if rebus
is a big public health problem what are
the factors are causing this horrible
terrifying deaths the second notion is
that word life play a big important role
in the maintenance of the rabies virus
and therefore for people that work on
the disease it feels like exercise in
futility that if you eliminate the
disease from dogs that transmit it then
what life are going to introduce the
disease I mean it&#39;s true that a few
countries in the West have wireless
variants of the rabies virus but the
studies that you&#39;ve done in Africa
showed that the virus that circulates
among the dogs is the same virus the
circlet inward life and importantly
studies for instance in serengeti
national park have shown that if you
vaccinate dogs around the park you do
not only reduce the numbers of rabies
cases to zero in dogs but also in
wildlife
that misconception is around the stray
dogs that you see roaming around most of
Africa now this dogs many of them have
owners and once you have gone out to do
math dog vaccinations we find out that
if you tell the people in time even the
dogs at Rome will be made available for
vaccinations the problem with this
notion is that you take away all the
efforts that would be taken to mass dog
vaccinations and put them into things
like bathing and shooting of stray dogs
in places like Bali Indonesia they have
tried that and found that the more they
shot the dog the more they tried killing
them the madurai be spread it does not
work the only solution that works in
terms of rabies elimination is actually
mast dog vaccination the good news is
other rabies is little is not the most
infectious disease now people that work
in this is often the time in the
interventionists of a disease using
suddenly the co are not which is a
number of secondary cases one infective
case will give in a population that has
not had the disease before now the
higher that number the bigots the bigger
problem is for you to eliminate it or
the more that be the proportion of the
population that you need to vaccinate
for avis is actually small at 1.2
meaning that you wanted to bring the
deceased down you only need to work in
it seventy percent of the population I
participate in organizing master
campaigns in East Africa and I can see
the endothelium with which small boys
and girls are bringing their dogs to be
vaccinated and keep the disease away
from humans it is working that
enthusiasm I hope can be taken up by
governments and people in rib is endemic
countries and one day let&#39;s make Kenya
and the world re be free please thank
you
