perhaps a quarter of all TED Talks
feature living organisms maybe more
whether there&#39;s an urgent need for
conservation or a creature that might
teach us something it&#39;s clear that this
audience really values biodiversity so
with your help we&#39;ve made ed Wilson&#39;s
grand vision a reality to build the
encyclopedia of life we started with
databases from the world&#39;s best museums
libraries and science projects and we
brought in content from Flickr and from
Wikipedia and invited everyone to add
text directly to AOL pages with the help
of global partners we have content now
in Spanish and in Arabic with more
languages to come because people should
be able to learn about the species they
care about in their own languages turns
out that species of scientists are
describing 15,000 new species every year
and so we&#39;ve set it up that if they
publish an open access journals will
create new pages on EOL automatically
for example for this tiny set of frogs
these smallest known tetrapods which
were just described a couple months ago
the best thing is that everything on yo
el even a software is available to use
for free and to reuse so they&#39;re
actually great for ted talks so as of
this week we have information on almost
a million species that&#39;s incredible
that&#39;s half of the tree of life and it&#39;s
only been five years but we&#39;re more than
just a bunch of web pages we&#39;re actually
a powerful platform for social
engagement with the living world a
thousand scientists and naturalist have
volunteered to help us with quality
control and they&#39;re working with over
50,000 members who are exploring eol
pages and building collections and
communities now I&#39;m an ornithologist and
many of you made the birders well we
have people on EOL making lists of all
the species in their backyards not just
Birds
using AOL they can make customized field
guides and soon we&#39;ll be able to take
any collection and turn it into an
instant mobile checklist at first it was
hard for some scientists to share so
openly why should they give away their
hard work for free but science is
changing on AOL scientists connect with
crowds of people who care as deeply
about biodiversity as we do we&#39;ve got
some great ideas for what those clouds
could do EO wilson said that if he&#39;d had
a site like this what took him 30 years
to do would now take only a few years to
accomplish imagine if we could inspire a
few more yo Wilson&#39;s like Matt Reinbold
who took this picture of frog died while
serving in the United States Air Force
so our next steps are to bring as many
eyeballs as possible to eol to work with
richer more computable data you helped
get us off the ground and now we&#39;re
gaining momentum the next five years
will be even more exciting thank you
