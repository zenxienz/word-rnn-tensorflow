well thank you so according to the
American microprocessor Association this
year we will produce more transistors
the individual components that go into
today&#39;s electronics then individual
grains of rice harvested on the planet
at a lower cost that&#39;s crazy that&#39;s
amazing inside of this box are about a
million grains of rice a modern
smartphone contains about a thousand
boxes worth of this this year will make
a billion of these cell phones Wow now
since only one of ten transistors
actually goes into making a cell phone
you might ask yourself where are they
going and how are they actually being
used so they&#39;re actually going into
three classes of devices that not only
process information but interact with
the physical world they are sensors
computers and fabricators and together
the combination will have enormous
impact on the way we design and make
things so think of sensors as devices
that perceive physical properties and
translate them into a stream of useful
digital information and as you&#39;d expect
sensors are becoming incredibly cheap
and immensely powerful they measure
everything from your heartbeat to the
flow of traffic in cities and much much
more now computers especially cloud
computers can process this information
and they allow us to produce meaningful
simulations okay and they can enable us
to manipulate and experiment with these
digital objects and digital models now
you&#39;ve probably heard of consumer 3d
printers that prints in plastic and
resin but the real advances are taking
place in industrial machines that have
material or sculpt them away and they&#39;re
printing everything from well jewelry
all the way up to jet engine parts so
these technologies augments three
capabilities that are central to the
very act of design sensors record or rip
our physical world and to help us
provide a better understanding of
context computers can
by these digital models to explore
better alternatives and fabricators can
construct tangible objects and tangible
things and together these three
capabilities establish a powerful system
of design a new way of thinking of
design called rip mod fab so how does it
work so say you wanted to design
something like I don&#39;t say a pair of
shoes the traditional way of doing this
is to begin with a generic model of a
foot that&#39;s called the last and it acts
as a reference guy that you can sketch
on and doodle and make alternatives and
as you do this you build prototypes in
this iterative loop and what you
selected a design that you like you
strip it to a factory and eventually you
get the final shoe in maybe 12 to 15
months okay Rick mod sab begins with the
scan of your foot with your exact
footprint and you know what&#39;s
interesting about this is that it can be
done with cell phones for free as you
can do this today now and so you have an
exact model of your foot which acts as a
starting point to build a digital
template a digital version of it and so
the computer can then modify that model
and simulate and build the version and
get the one that you exactly want to
have done so and once the model is
complete you can have it fabricated in
it using robotics and voila a shoe so
that&#39;s the goal okay it&#39;s not quite here
yet but it&#39;s coming and what&#39;s
interesting about this is that it&#39;s
completely potentially going to change
the business model of footwear you would
buy the intellectual property of the
shoe that fits you exactly but you might
lease the material of the ship of the
printed shoe returning it once it&#39;s
finished so that&#39;s a simple example now
what if you wanted to take advantage of
this crazy amount of technology that&#39;s
available what each if you wanted to
design such a strong and light chair so
this simulation priest by david benjamin
starts by generating one chair and then
it evaluates it determines it
strengthens and other parameters then it
does it again and the
again and again and again again it
produces hundreds thousands tens of
thousands hundreds of thousands displays
them on a landscape it can create more
designs than any person here can create
in a lifetime and you sort of play God
selecting the one that you want and when
you&#39;re ready you print it out huh so Wow
is that real yeah it is real so maybe
that chair doesn&#39;t look particularly
comfortable or attractive not intended
to be you could start by designing a
bike and have this particular shape and
have the computer modify the internal
parameters creating a kind of lattice
work that places material only where it
needs to be and you know the interesting
thing that about this is that when you
look at it close up the computer
discovers patterns that resemble some
things that look familiar it resembles
microscopic bone and that&#39;s insane
because it mimics nature solutions huh
through brute force so different
industries are beginning to use this
kind of technology this is the ER be
it&#39;s the first 3d printed car in my
hometown of Winnipeg Manitoba not an
industrial center just recently a
company called Local Motors a 3d printed
a fully drivable car in 44 hours in 44
hours that&#39;s two days what does that
mean for the automotive industry that&#39;s
incredible in the construction industry
it&#39;s not uncommon to scan an entire
building by flying a drone around it and
then that gets converted into a digital
model which you can modify that happens
very quickly and what&#39;s not so common
yet are 3d printers concrete printers
that will then fabricate this but
there&#39;s a chinese company now that is
already printing 10 houses a day for
under five thousand dollars each yikes
so the lesson here is that as soon as
information technology touches an
industry that industry is forever change
right along the compounding growth of
digital tools so i think that rip mod
fab will fulfill the promise of uniting
the digital with the physical
own way to connect the customized
products for their beautiful and
functional and elegant so this is really
just the tip of the iceberg so when you
have a tremendous amount of
computational power you can optimize not
just an individual component but an
entire system so one manufacturer is
improving an engine by starting with a
piston that makes it lighter and then
that allows the return spring to be
thinner which then allows the shaft to
be shorter and then the changes cascades
through the entire system and they&#39;ve
been able to shrink the engine by
two-thirds just by beginning with one
part this is the future of design this
is going to have I think really
significant implications for designers
as well as for engineers because it&#39;s
going to shift design from making forms
to establishing goals and constraints
and then allowing the computer to
simulate the forms or discover them it
moves us from creating or ideas to
searching for the best ideas and it
equips designers to comprehensively
design entire systems so will this be
used by everyone no I don&#39;t think so
it&#39;s going to be really a most optimal
for the the wickedly complex projects
but I think it&#39;s really going to
transform the very nature of design make
it far more organic than ever before so
more transistors than grains of rice and
by the way this milestone happened in
the year 2008 and it&#39;s been doubling
ever since and it&#39;s creating a world
where digital power is essentially free
and infinite and it&#39;s kind of like
giving us super design powers it&#39;s
allowing us to extend our senses to an
exquisite view of the world as it
actually is it&#39;s giving a super brain
power to envision the world as we&#39;d like
it to be and it&#39;s giving us magic
capabilities for us to build just about
anything and I think the combination of
this three capabilities our ability to
read understand and write back to the
world
something to get pretty excited about
thanks so much
