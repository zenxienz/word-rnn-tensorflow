I grew up in Chicago and I was very
influenced by design and architecture
specifically the Bauhaus and I always
wanted to also eventually live in a
glass house in the forest Mies van der
Rohe was a big inspiration for both the
Bauhaus and the design of his Farnsworth
house in Plano Illinois that was built
in 1951 he also influenced Phillip
Johnson who built another glass house in
1949 which is called the Glass House
Phillip Johnson said that it&#39;s more
difficult to build a house like this
than a skyscraper
Toshiko Morrie went to school with my
wife at Cooper Union and she designed
this house upstate New York it&#39;s mostly
glass but it has different shapes to
accommodate the functions that the
Kelly&#39;s use we wanted something very
simple very minimal and I was influenced
by a temple in Japan called Katsura
which was built in the 1600s and they
separated the buildings based on the
season we built our house as a
deconstructed house of four pieces plus
a garage that are all about the same
size as the Farnsworth in the Glass
House there&#39;s a place to eat there&#39;s a
place to exercise there&#39;s a guest house
in the main house so it&#39;s really a
deconstructed program
and 120 acres in Columbia County we&#39;re
tied together by sidewalks that are
heated in this case because of the the
environment and the house is very simple
with it&#39;s very similar on the top as the
bottom very influenced by the Airstream
trailer that we used when we were
building the house to make things
smaller and more functional we&#39;re using
prefabrication by a company called Shoe
Co bill Baker from Skidmore in Chicago
did the structural design he also built
the Burj Kalifa tell this the largest
the highest structure in the world below
grade is a lot of technology to corrupt
to control things like geothermal etc
and above-ground it&#39;s very simple
dieter Rams furniture and others like
John pouvez was also very influenced by
we control everything through an iPad
using savant we also have incorporated
Chinese Buddhist sculpture and the main
thing that I learned in doing this house
is how similar it is between information
architecture and physical space and
that&#39;s where I&#39;ll spend the next six
years of my career at r/ga thank you
