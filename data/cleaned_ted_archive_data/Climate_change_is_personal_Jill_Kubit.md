scientists tell us that we have a
massive problems global climate change
many say it&#39;s the greatest problem that
we currently face some even say it could
be the greatest challenge ever faced by
human civilization we know the reasons
fossil fuels and deforestation we know
the results rising sea levels mass
migration and we know the science we&#39;ve
already passed 400 parts per million
concentration in the atmosphere and
we&#39;ve seen one degree of Celsius warming
now tell me did your eyes glaze over yet
so I&#39;ve spent the last 10 years trying
to engage people on climate change and
when I started doing this work I assumed
that if I just talked about the
scientific facts if you knew what I knew
then you would be inspired to take
action but it turns out that learning
the science by itself doesn&#39;t work for
most people it doesn&#39;t fit with our
experiences and the day to day view of
the world and even though we&#39;ve begun to
see images of rising seas and extreme
weather events most of us have not seen
our comfortable lives disrupted and
therefore we don&#39;t see climate change as
a top priority when compared to good
jobs good schools and other more
pressing issues climate change is only
something that we continue to see is in
the distance it&#39;s either far away in
time or it&#39;s happening to people it&#39;s
not really happening to us and there are
those of us that see the issue as so
massive that we jump straight to
hopelessness there&#39;s nothing we can do I
can&#39;t make a difference well I thought a
lot about how to best talk about this
issue so that people can relate
issue and I got posted from a number of
different ways a lot of my work has been
on thinking about how a transition to
renewable energy economy will create
jobs I&#39;ve also thought a lot about the
health benefits and the economic
benefits but it turns out that all of
those reasons are still just like
scientific facts they&#39;re rational
arguments there&#39;s something missing in
about the way that we talk about climate
change feelings so how do we make
climate change feel relevant how do we
take an issue that seems so overwhelming
and so distant and make it feel more
personal and immediate how do we get
people to connect to the issue and how
do we inspire people to become engaged
well I have an idea let&#39;s talk about
climate change from a place of love what
do I mean by this I mean that even for
me and activist
someone who&#39;s worked on this for the
last ten years I didn&#39;t think much about
climate change in a personal way until I
became a parent in addition to changing
almost everything else about my life
having a child made me see climate
change through a different lens you see
what climate Sciences activists and
policymakers talk about climate change
and they talk about the need to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions or increase
renewable energy standards they refer to
years like 2020 2030 and 2050 those
times always seems so far off but now
those are the times then my son Gabriel
will be in the first grade graduating
from high school and about the age that
I am now and they no longer seem very
far away I&#39;ve begun to imagine his life
unfolding during this next period of
time where we either make a massive
transformation of our society or we
begin to endure
catastrophic climate change when I find
Gabriel was 18 months old I met another
mother Tricia Sturm
she had just written a letter to her
daughter Eleanor about climate change to
open in the future this letter became
the first in a project that she and I
co-founded called seer tomorrow at its
core this project is a series of letters
videos and photos about climate change
dedicated to the people that we love our
children grandchildren nieces nephews
our friends sometimes even our future
selves we share these stories on social
media and they become part of our
long-term archive preserve for the
recipients when they are grown at its
core this issue is actually very simple
we are simply connecting climate change
to the values that we already hold the
values of family parenting and lyta see
and we are not the first people to make
this connection for the last several
decades there have been moms and dads
and the environmental justice movement
who have connected pollution to the
health of their children and in the last
five years there have been a number of
new organizations that have emerged that
engage parents and grandparents on the
issue of climate change but what our
project does is amplify this idea we
open up a conversation between
generations and also amongst friends
your friends and family on Facebook will
be more open to reading a letter about
your child and climate change than they
would a news article
global warming this year tomorrow
project is an opportunity to open up a
conversation about climate change from
the place of love these words were
written by joy let&#39;s in a letter to her
two sons it is an act of love to you and
everyone who comes after I really could
not live with myself if I let an act of
injustice as big as leaving you an
unlivable climate and didn&#39;t do
everything I could possibly do to stop
it
I stay up late at night and I read these
letters they inspire me like this one
from Stacey a mother of three I want for
you to be able to watch the sunset in
the distance and feel hope for your
tomorrow I want you to witness the
massive changes we made as a society to
protect you and this precious planet so
far we have received hundreds of letters
and I have read every single one of them
there is a power and a potential in
every letter to change ourselves and to
inspire others
now we know that our project is not the
answer to climate change it is not the
one answer that everybody has been
waiting for but there are many many
solutions that are available right now
our project builds on this and provides
an opportunity for us to have that
conversation
in a letter from Ryan to his children I
know it is a long past time to wake up
the choices my generation makes now will
determine your future this is not a
choice just about future generations
this is about us and the people that we
love now those we already know we write
these letters we express our hopes and
concerns for the future our vision for
what is possible and our commitment to
act we share them with the people around
us our friends our family our social
networks maybe they will change some
minds maybe they will inspire people to
act the seeds of change are planted in
many minds and the world begins to shift
first all too slowly and then faster and
faster we need to make these changes
fast as fast as a boy like Gabriel grows
up this is the world I want for my child
and yours thank you
[Applause]
