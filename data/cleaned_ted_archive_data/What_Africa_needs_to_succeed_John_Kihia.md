good afternoon um my talk today will be
on what we need to do in order to make
Africa succeed and I&#39;ll start by making
a special request from all of you and if
the request is can we set up this okay
thank you
now I would want us to imagine that you
are all applicants and you are living in
Africa then come the first three rows
sit down please first three rows on the
first three rows okay congratulations
you have enough to take care of yourself
and to have and you have enough to plan
for your future the last of you are poor
and 80% of you poorer farmers living on
small-scale farms and what this means is
that you live far away from in a town
far away from the main roads you don&#39;t
have access to electricity or running
water and you have low education and you
don&#39;t have a lot of market marketable
skills
however you are still you you are still
you and that means that you have still
have vast ammunition to get what you&#39;d
need in life you have a very smart you
are very entrepreneurial and you still
have that dream to be to get what you
want in future sit down thanks a lot
and I want to go back to I grew up in a
small farm in the rural areas in 1970s
this was a time when we had cold war and
therefore education was free health
services for free food were subsidized
and therefore the need for money was
very true but now we are living in a
cash economy where they need for lots of
money to buy and to purchase everything
and in that kind of circumstance what
would you need your number one need is
money and if you need money the next
question that you ask yourself is what
would you do who do well begging do you
want a doubt I don&#39;t think so what
you&#39;ll be looking for is an opportunity
an opportunity to give you money and
they are no job and without jobs the
best alternative is to start a very high
profitable business and in America today
I think two out of every three new jobs
are from small businesses and in Africa
what we need our opportunities
opportunities that you read to creation
of millions of highly profitable jobs
for me for the very small scale farmers
who are living out there they are the
majority just like you thank you
