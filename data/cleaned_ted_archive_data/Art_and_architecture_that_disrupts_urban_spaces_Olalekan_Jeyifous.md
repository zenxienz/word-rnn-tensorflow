good evening everybody
thank you very much for coming out I&#39;m
gonna be discussing my artistic practice
with you guys so I&#39;ll be showing a
couple projects one of them I&#39;ll be
speaking about more in depth and I&#39;m
just waiting for the slide to come up
okay so my artwork is heavily influenced
by my background in architecture and
you&#39;re going to see that in the work
that I&#39;m showing you I creates
speculative architectural interventions
into urban surfaces and spaces and they
reflect my love of science fiction as
well as interest in borrowed and
invented narratives that include
geopolitics culture technology as well
as mythology on a much larger scale I&#39;m
also very much fascinated by urban
planning and urban growth and urban
development so what you&#39;re looking at
right is this plan abstracted plan that
I refer to as urban growth strategies
and they&#39;re actually derived from images
microscopic slides of liquids
interacting on the cellular level and so
I was really fascinated about the idea
of this sort of self-organizing
proponent and how that could then be
projected onto this large scale and how
that could be used to examine the ways
in which cities evolved grow and are
organized I&#39;m also interested in
cityscapes in landscapes and realizing
them in creating them imbued with
utopian or dystopian ideals depending on
whatever the conceptual framework is so
that said this is the gap map and in the
project it&#39;s actually a project
narrative it&#39;s actually owned by gap but
that&#39;s also an acronym for a greater
area protocol and the idea of a Hyannis
project is that it focuses on total
surveillance linguistic as well as space
segregation and the commodification of
every aspect of basic human interaction
so someone who&#39;s really good at
promoting a brand gets access to greater
areas of the city and those who are not
that good are very limited it was
loosely related to South Africa&#39;s
apartheid era pass laws so you can see
from my work I&#39;m much more interested in
generating inquiry and discourse than
creating solutions to social issues or
coming up with design problems the work
is speculative and it&#39;s fantastic coal
and it&#39;s about world building but still
grounded in a lot of contemporary issues
a project that I&#39;ve been working on
recently that is going to be ongoing
it&#39;s my shanty megastructures for Lagos
Nigeria and the idea behind this project
is that I&#39;m taking the material and the
construction and building typology x&#39; as
well as the organizational strategies of
shacks and favelas and slums and
informal settlements and I&#39;m blowing
that up to this really large scale of
commercial developments and the idea
behind it is to basically bring
visibility as well as prominence to
marginalized communities they&#39;re often
displaced often not considered and
you&#39;re actually looking at a series of
photo montages where I&#39;ve created 3d
constructs designed them on a computer
and then interjected them into spaces of
privilege real estate throughout Lagos
oh nothing you&#39;re seeing is real this
isn&#39;t even this isn&#39;t built none of this
is real so that said this take place in
Lagos Nigeria which is one of the
fastest growing mega cities on planet
Earth
it&#39;s home to more than 25 million
inhabitants that number is stated to
double in the next 10-15 years or so
that said it&#39;s a place of an incredible
amounts of ingenuity and creativity and
potential you have major corporate and
global economies
existing at the same time with the
informal mark
which is prevalent throughout Lagos
conversely there is a lot of poverty
there is failing infrastructure there is
traffic which is a nightmare and these
are the sort of things that I&#39;m
interested when I&#39;m looking at imagining
a future city and I&#39;m excited about how
Legos will transform over the next you
know few years 10 15 20 years but I&#39;m a
little bit dismayed that a lot of the
development focus focuses primarily on
luxury development any of the
middle-class development and very often
communities such as macoco Village are
completely overlooked and this occurs
you know throughout the world this is
not just you know Lagos Nigeria so the
idea of this image is to you know really
bring to light these communities exist
and they should be considered in terms
of design and not only considered and be
designed for but they actually have a
lot to contribute this is built in terms
of green technology aquaponics
vermiculture agriculture as well as
sustainable resources land reclamation
waste reclamation land reuse so this is
what a lot of my work focuses on really
bringing these things to light thank you
so much for your time
[Applause]
