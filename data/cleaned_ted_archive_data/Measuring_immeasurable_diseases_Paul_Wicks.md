130 years ago Lord Kelvin says when you
cannot measure what you&#39;re speaking
about when you cannot express it in
numbers then your knowledge is of a
meager and unsatisfactory kind it may be
the beginning of knowledge but you have
scarcely in your thoughts advanced to
the stage of science this quote really
resonates with me because for the past
decade I&#39;ve been trying to take the
measure of mysterious and unmeasurable
diseases like autism mood disorders or
ALS when we think about measurement we
often think of the tools we have that
we&#39;re born with our hands our feet the
length of our strident for a long time
that was sufficient for most measurement
but as we develop more sophisticated
tools we need more sophisticated
measurements ones that were precise that
could be calibrated so that parts
assembled in many different parts of the
world would work together harmoniously
in a system so where are we with
measurement when it comes to medicine on
the one hand we have diseases that are
measured well HIV heart disease and
cancer where we&#39;ve made amazing progress
but on the other hand we have the
diseases that I study we have mood
disorders or we have the rare diseases
that affect so many people and remain
unmeasured and it&#39;s a huge challenge
there are no inches of insomnia there
are no pounds of pain and some diseases
skirt the boundaries between these two
domains something like multiple
sclerosis has incredibly detailed
technological measurements this is a
three-dimensional cube MRI scanner by GE
and to the trained eye the hyper-intense
white spots can be visualized in three
dimensions down to level of millimeter
so you might think we have it covered
but it turns out that&#39;s not the whole
story where the lesions are or how big
they are doesn&#39;t actually correlate all
that wealth of experience with the
patient has living with disease on a
day-to-day basis because each of our
brains are slightly different it&#39;s very
hard for simple data about groups of
patients or have they change over time
and of course an MRI is an expensive and
sophisticated piece of technology which
means our opportunity to sample patients
over time is limited to so my concern is
that right now our knowledge of MS
remains of a meager and unser
factory kind I have faith though that
they&#39;re a group of pioneers who can help
us change this they&#39;re the patients that
live with disease every day for the past
seven years I&#39;ve been working with the
online patient networker patients like
me to help patients like Jess with MS
here to measure her disease we
constructed an MS rating scale
consisting of seven simple questions
about her cognition her speech her
vision of swallowing her walking and it
turns out these measures correlate very
well with the neurological assessment
done by trained clinician she can do
this as many times a month or a year as
she wants to when you have data such as
we have we have about 200,000 patients
in total about 30,000 of them with
multiple sclerosis you can start
aggregating that data up this is a
prototype that we made with one mind for
research and Orien buyer networks which
takes all of the data about every
patient and uses it to make an
individualized personalized prediction
of where jess with ms will be two years
from now along with appropriate
statistical confidence intervals so when
you have the right measures you can do
amazing things but there&#39;s a void to be
filled of measurement in medicine there
are only a few hundred instruments like
the MS rating scale that have been
developed and validated with patients in
mind for the thousands of diseases that
we have but I think we can change that
too today I&#39;m proud to announce the way
the support of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation this year patients like me
will be building an unprecedented new
open science platform disease but
experts and researchers from around the
world will be able to come to patients
like me and develop new instruments
they&#39;ll be able to listen to the
patients that live with disease every
day immediately and in real time so they
can iterate on the instruments improve
upon them and then deploy them best of
all every instrument develops on the
platform will be licensed under Creative
Commons so that the instruments will be
free for anyone forever so with hundreds
of instruments imagine what we could do
then think of all the other technologies
that we don&#39;t yet have when we integrate
Google glass when we integrate the
medical tricorders then we&#39;re really
going to be able to understand these
diseases and learn about them not for
curiosity not for publication
not for profit but to take them apart
one by one and consign into the history
books thank you
