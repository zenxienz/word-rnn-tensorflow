so imagine that I offer you a drunk drop
it into the water supply I say and
pretty soon everyone&#39;s going to start
sharing your political views on climate
change on abortion you name it
you&#39;d be pretty tempted wouldn&#39;t ya I
mean politics matters after all and who
doesn&#39;t want the blowhards on the other
side to start voting your way but if
you&#39;re like most folks you&#39;d probably
hesitate and rightly so there&#39;s
something wrong and well deeply wrong
about trying to get other people to go
think your way just by manipulating them
or coercing we want to convince our
political opponents we won&#39;t but we want
to do so with reason it&#39;s not with force
or threats so reasons matter but what
sorts of reasons should we care about in
public debate in particular why should
we care about giving reasons that emerge
from a broadly scientific conception of
rationality as opposed to let&#39;s say more
traditional or religious ways of
thinking it&#39;s not an easy question it&#39;s
not easy because I think we&#39;re
increasingly divided in this country
over what even counts as a good reason
we all know how you know polarize we
become sure but what I think is less
often noticed is that we are not just
divided over our moral values we&#39;re
actually also divided over our epistemic
values over our very principles of
knowledge and rationality and so forth
[Laughter]
so we&#39;re not we&#39;re not just divided over
our moral values were divided over our
conceptions of knowledge and rationality
now when we get into political debates
we&#39;re often arguing over policy we&#39;re
trying to decide what to do like you
know what to teach in the schools for
example but before we can decide what to
do we&#39;ve got to agree on some of the
facts like which textbooks are accurate
and which aren&#39;t
but before we can decide on the facts
and agree on the facts we&#39;ve got to
agree at least on some of the principles
and methods we use to figure out what
the facts are for figuring out the facts
and that&#39;s where we are right now in
this culture
I mean debates over climate change
evolution even the history of the United
States are not just about those subject
matters anymore they&#39;re also about
whether we should give more weight to
observation and and logic or more weight
in so let&#39;s say consulting sacred texts
at least some of the time
now when debates get to this point they
can seem really impossible to resolve
because it&#39;s you know I mean if you
think about it&#39;s going to be really hard
to give reasons for your very standards
of reasons without begging the question
without assuming what you&#39;re trying to
prove you&#39;re going to end up arguing and
defending science with science and
religion with religion and the other
side is going to cry foul so it seems to
me that disagreement over reasons while
central problem doesn&#39;t necessarily show
that disagreement per se is that I mean
democracies thrive on disagreement after
all the noted political philosopher John
Rawls said that you know democracies
inherently involved dialogue between
incompatible but reasonable doctrines
but there&#39;s the rub how are we going to
decide whose views count as reasonable
and whose views don&#39;t if we can&#39;t even
agree on what reasonableness is now how
do we engage in dialogue with people on
the other side of the aisle if we can&#39;t
exchange reason for newsflash we don&#39;t
and we can
so it seems to me what this tells us
what this should tell us anyway is that
civil society requires a common currency
in which not only to exchange money but
a common currency in which to exchange
reasons in my view this common currency
should be founded on principles of a
broadly scientific conception of
rationality but not because those
principles and the methods they endorse
are more accurate although I do think
they&#39;re more accurate but because using
those sorts of principles in public
debate respects our autonomy more it&#39;s
more democratic than using principles
and methods that appeal only to
Authority or religion okay so imagine
imagine we&#39;re going to get a spaceship
and blast off to another planet they
call it parallel earth what do we know
about parallel earth you ask well we
know it&#39;s going to have great beaches
and excellent happy hour specials and we
know that the people there are going to
be humans like us and that the earth is
going to be a parallel earth is going to
be a lot like ours and that there&#39;s
going to be societies they&#39;re a lot like
our societies and so forth and so on but
we don&#39;t know two really important
things about it the first thing we don&#39;t
know is we don&#39;t know who we&#39;re going to
be when we go to parallel earth we don&#39;t
know what our race is going to be what
our gender is going to be our income
level our education level or our
religion etc etc and we also don&#39;t know
and this is the really weird part we
also don&#39;t know what principles and
methods for accessing the truth are
going to be accurate on parallel earth
so on parallel earth it might turn out
but consulting the sacred texts really
is the best method for learning about
the truth or maybe not maybe no method
is going to be accurate we just don&#39;t
know
but suppose we had to decide anyway
before we got in the spaceship and
blasted off we had to decide what
principles and methods for accessing the
truth we were going to privilege or give
weight to in public debate once we got
there what would we go on well we know
we can&#39;t say well let&#39;s just privilege
the ones that are accurate because we
don&#39;t know what goes up and it wouldn&#39;t
be wise or in our self-interest would be
smart really to just say well let&#39;s just
go with whatever principles and methods
are endorsed by the people in power on
parallel right because we don&#39;t know who
those people are gonna be we don&#39;t know
you know whether we&#39;re going to be
amongst for the same reason you know
probably wouldn&#39;t be smart or in our
self-interest to go for you know just
let&#39;s go and take up whatever principles
methods are going to be suggested by the
sacred texts on parallel earth because
we don&#39;t even know for example whether
we&#39;re going to be able to read those
texts so what are we going to go on what
are we going to make this decision again
when we don&#39;t know who we&#39;re going to be
and we don&#39;t know which methods are
going to be accurate well it seems like
it would be reasonable to go for those
methods and principles for accessing the
truth that are emerged out of sort of
shared capacities we have as human
beings capacities to observe our
environment or to think logically at
least to some extent about about that
environment and about our thoughts about
it I mean even if those methods and for
some bizarre reason turned out not to be
accurate at least we now going in that
these are methods and principles that
are inclusive that we have a reasonable
chance of hearing using once we get to
parallel just because we&#39;re human beings
so this little you know science fiction
story little political fable I just told
you of course comes from work by Hobbes
and Rousseau and Locke and John Rawls
and I think it really shows us something
important about the value of
giving reasons that are based on this
broadly scientific conception of
rationality I&#39;ve been talking about
because those principles principles that
of that sort would be the ones that
would be reasonable to endorse in an you
know hypothetical situation of social
and epistemic equality when we&#39;re all in
the same boat and we don&#39;t know which
methods are accurate and it seems like
it&#39;s in our self-interest to go for
those methods that are going to emerge
out of our shared capacities as human
beings but there&#39;s more than
self-interest at stake there&#39;s also I
think a straightforwardly ethical reason
to privilege principles of scientific
rationality Johann Zollner was a 18th
century essayist part-time philosopher
full time clergyman but now he&#39;s really
only remembered for one thing he&#39;s the
dude that asked a question that inspired
Todd
so in the Zoners day in
eighteenth-century Prussia there was a
debate going on it&#39;s going to sound
familiar to you it was a debate over
marriage and the debate was whether
marriage as the progressives of the day
or claiming should be a civil
institution or whether it should be
understood as a religious institution
now the progressives as I&#39;ve noted they
thought that it should be a civil
institution and they claimed that what
this thing that you know the sort of
idea they called the Enlightenment sort
of you know gave credence to that the
Zollner was having none of that
so in 1783 a little bit before the
French Revolution he publishes an essay
in a popular magazine of the day called
the Berlin Monthly and in that essay uh
he you know he rails against the sort of
enlightenment values and he says that
roughly but only a religion can ground
such an important social institution and
moreover religious authority should be
given more weight in public debate but
then in the foot
but note he says it&#39;s really interesting
thing he he says and besides whoever
could tell us what this enlightenment
thing was anyway nobody can define it so
a few months later philosopher Immanuel
Kant publishes a response in the same
popular magazine to Zolt to Zollner is
outside and he calls it and answers the
question what is enlightenment and what
God says is that enlightenment is
humanity&#39;s emergence from a self-imposed
immaturity a self-imposed in Detroit the
maturity due to lack of courage
lack of courage to think for yourself as
opposed to letting other people think
for you now times concern wasn&#39;t just
self-reliance as he goes on in the essay
to make clear what do you really wanted
to say is that the very fact that we are
beings that can think for ourselves
shows us that we owe it to each other as
citizens to give reasons to each other
that recognize that fact that recognize
the fact that we are beings that at
least hypothetically can say for
ourselves I think this is you know gets
at a second and straightforwardly
ethical reason for giving some weight to
the principles of scientific rationality
in public debate even if you do know the
truth even if you&#39;re the Oracle of
Delphi or Plato&#39;s philosopher king you
shouldn&#39;t just appeal to that authority
when justifying or giving reasons for
your views about what you think is true
you should try to give reasons that
other human beings can recognize as rain
reasons how at least because in part
there are human beings when I give you
reasons like that then I&#39;m treating you
as a being that cat least hypothetically
can make up your own mind I am treating
you with dignity I&#39;m treating you
like a grown-up and there&#39;s value in
treating you in that way all in and of
itself
now a lot of people find this sort of
emphasis con sentences on the importance
of rationality 90 and you know of course
a lot of psychological data
not to mention common sense tells us
that we&#39;re really picking rotten
reasoner&#39;s on the individual level I
mean we we overgeneralize we&#39;re ripe
with prejudice we forget to carry the
one I mean and that&#39;s just me
you know so on the individual level
really we&#39;re really bad reasoner&#39;s but
that doesn&#39;t mean that we should give up
on reason in the public domain what it
means is that we need to erect public
institutions that promote fix the
exchange of reasons that promote what
cognitive called public reason
institutions can help us overcome our
private limitations our personal
limitations that&#39;s in part what
institutions are for so that&#39;s why I
think that even if you think that the
Bible or grin or Dianetics is the
ultimate guide to the truth in your
private life in your public life you
should be supporting institutions like
the neh or the NSF or frankly even this
one because institutions that promote
the exchange of reasons of the sorts
I&#39;ve been talking about are doing the
work of democracy at least that&#39;s what I
think you&#39;ll think if you agree with me
that democracy is about working out our
differences by means other than force
and manipulation
that&#39;s what you&#39;ll think if you think
that democracy is something that it&#39;s a
practice that we can engage in as mature
human beings that&#39;s what you&#39;ll think if
you think that democracy involves
respecting each other&#39;s autonomy and
that as I said is what I think is the
most basic reason for privilege in
principles of scientific rationality and
public debate now there&#39;s of course an
alternative way of looking at things
there&#39;s a different way of looking at
things you can see politics as war by
other means all right but once you start
thinking of things in that way you face
a really disturbing slide you start to
see the people on the other side of the
aisle not this fellow citizen but as
combatants and dupes to be manipulated
or coerced
and that&#39;s a problem
it&#39;s a familiar point in this country in
the poisonous political climate that we
live and it&#39;s a sort of thinking
unfortunately that encourages people to
go for the drug that I mentioned at the
beginning or to go for the super PAC or
to go for the gun but I think there&#39;s
hope even in the climate that we&#39;re
living today I think there is some hope
I mean our society just like Kant&#39;s
before us has been recently embroiled in
debate over marriage the debate in the
arcades about marriage
between gay and lesbian couples and it
seems to me that is becoming pretty
clear that the side that&#39;s been favoring
reason in the sense I&#39;ve been talking
about has been winning the field over
the side that has been favoring
tradition respect for autonomy as one
over that&#39;s just how we do it around
here and that I think gives us hope it
tells us that reasons can work in the
long run even if not always in the short
run and it reminds us of why can&#39;t
civics lesson is so important for us
today it reminds us that democracy and
rationality go hand in hand the one
really cool idea about the Enlightenment
that I like to hold on to is the idea
that we have a shared currency of
reasons just by virtue of being human
beings giving up on that is to give up
to give up on an essential Democratic
hope I hope that politics doesn&#39;t have
to be for by other means I hope that
democracies can and should be spaces of
reasons sure this is a hope it&#39;s an
aspiration it&#39;s an ideal but it&#39;s one I
believe is still worth striving for
thank you
[Applause]
