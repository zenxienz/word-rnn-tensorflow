when I was still an extremist I
celebrated the 9/11 attacks when the
news came in over the radio that a plane
that hit a building the first thing that
came out of my mouth was god is great
Allahu Akbar now you see extremists are
made and not born in my journey as a
middle-class Muslim kid from Canada
began at a Koran school that I attended
every day of the week every weekend the
boys were on one side the girls were on
another side and both of us would be
rocking back and forth in front of
wooden benches reciting the Quran by
rote not understanding a word of what we
were reciting if you made a mistake you
were slapped you were beaten we were put
into a stress position and this is where
I was first introduced to the concept
that religion is something violent of
course the public school that I went to
during the day was the complete opposite
of this environment the boys and girls
mixed was a nurturing caring environment
he weren&#39;t slapped if he made a mistake
and this contrast would lay the
foundation for an identity crisis for my
identity crisis that would manifest
later on in high school I wasn&#39;t bullied
in high school I wasn&#39;t picked on we
were one of the cool kids but one day
when my parents were gone overseas
I had a house party and unbeknownst to
me my father had told his brother my
uncle to check on the house while he was
gone so as a teenager
has this party happening and all the
friends are over in the middle of the
party my uncle walks in and he begins
yelling and screaming telling everyone
to get out he grabbed me by the scruff
of my neck he says what have you done
you&#39;ve shamed the family you have
dishonored and defiled the home people
pray here he said you&#39;re bringing these
people here to do these things he called
up other uncle&#39;s who came to the house
sat me down surrounded me and berated me
over and over making me feel so guilty
over what I had done and so I told
myself there the only way for me to
dissolve egde what was left of my my
credibility my reputation in the family
and in the community was to quote
unquote get religious so I took a four
month trip to India and Pakistan and as
I was walking about a rural area I saw
these men would look like religious men
and I approached them to seek some
wisdom from them they were not religious
men and I don&#39;t know if they had wisdom
to impart on me but they said to me look
if you want to bring about a change in
the world then you have to do it through
jihad you have to do it through the
ak-47 and when I returned back to the
mosque that I was staying at
they followed back with me they let me
fire their ak-47 and I was bit by the
jihadi bug they were to me the heroes
that I heard about that we read about in
the books of old warriors of Islam
companions of the prophet alayhi Salaam
I then returned back to Canada and
manifested this mentality internally and
externally recruiting other young people
to the cause we saw ourselves as
vanguards of the faith warriors ready to
vanquish our enemies
by any means necessary of course well
although I initially celebrated the
attacks I quickly realized that I could
not reconcile my understanding of
religion with what I had seen and
witnessed I resolved that I would go to
Syria to study Arabic and Islamic
studies
I sold my belongings it took my wife and
my two young children at the time and I
left but what I found in Syria was not
what they showed me on the brochure I
saw a real police state I thought back
to the country that was from Canada and
I thought hey maybe this isn&#39;t such an
oppressive state after all I could
gather as I liked I could rail against
the government as I wanted nobody was
going to black-bag me and disappear me
but most importantly the Islamic
University that I attended I met a young
Islamic scholar who would challenge my
interpretations I spent a year and a
half with him we went over chapter and
verse of what extremists use cherry-pick
and mutilate the understanding of Islam
I came to realize that my
interpretations were completely wrong
but I was also disillusioned with what I
had seen in Syria and with a newfound
understanding of the religion returned
to Canada in 2004 of course the first
week I was back in the front page of the
paper was a young man who had been
arrested on terrorism charges in
connection with the London bomb plot
that young man was from my Quran school
that I attended as a child he was my
friend that used to sit next to me
so I contacted the Security Intelligence
Service I thought this has to be a
mistake I wanted to give a character
reference for the family&#39;s good family
but it was out of their hands it was in
the courts but of course after that
phone call an hour later I was sitting
across the table from an intelligence
agent intelligence officer who of course
recruited me to become an undercover
account
operative or his eyesight doing my
Islamic duty to protect innocent people
now I can&#39;t talk about the intelligence
assignments that I did infiltration
operations but my last assignment would
become the most public assignment and I
Traverse over to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police integrated national
security enforcement team and gave
testimony in five legal hearings over
four years and one of the things that I
noticed and observed when I was
undercover is the presence of converts
in these groups and the reality is the
vast majority of converts who become
Muslim actually become better Muslims
than born Muslims and it is also true
that those who come from a generally
dysfunctional background are more
vulnerable to recruitment by violent
extremists or the women and the girls
that are being lured over by predators
who have this idea that they&#39;re going to
meet their jihadi prints on the other
side girls who are cooped up at home who
can&#39;t have functional gender
interactions with boys so they stay at
home and they find their boys online and
so they can get their piece of ICANN so
what I&#39;m going to do is try to chart the
process by which an individual goes from
quote-unquote normal to violent
extremists just a clarification of terms
radicalization is a process a process by
which an individual comes to believe
that violence in public spaces is
acceptable once that person accepts that
they are an extremist and when they act
on that there are a violent extremists
so first and foremost basic
psychological discourse on nature versus
nurture and this is how we grow up
observing and absorbing from our parents
and from our societies around us but as
we come as we become more self-aware
certain things start to pop up in our
lives that we become interested in so
whether it&#39;s geopolitics or the idea of
deprivation so when you&#39;re a young kid
15 years old watching jihadi videos of
your people
abused assaulted persecuted oppressed
mutilated killed you begin to feel
deprived or if it&#39;s an issue of identity
and belonging or ideology extremist
ideology where really its fascistic in
the end my way or else the second phase
is where people become active in some
kind of social movement or social
protest community and when you join a
group you are more likely to do things
that you would not do as an and it as an
individual think back to when you&#39;re 15
16 things that you did because your
friends told you to do it I know I
remember
but the third category is what really
resonates in this context of behaviors
observable behavioral changes that you
can see in people that will indicate
that this person is going to become a
violent extremist or is most certainly
vulnerable to recruitment by violent
extremists the question now is how to
reverse this trend I went through a
period of de-radicalization after
spending time with a with a chef who
could explain to me the meaning of the
of the verses of chapter and verse with
what we see today with young children
young boys young girls something needs
to be done there&#39;s a role for government
to play for communities to play for
faith communities to play for just
regular average men and women to play
break the stereotypes remove the labels
think past and look past my journey has
been emotional intellectual and deeply
spiritual I&#39;ve traveled thousands of
miles interacted with and learned from
thousands of people and I know that I
stand stronger today knowing that I have
a deeper understanding of the
complexities of religion of extremism
and of the world we live in today thank
you very much
you
