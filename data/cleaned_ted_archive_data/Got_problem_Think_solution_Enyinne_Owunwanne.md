so growing up my dad used to tell my
siblings and I got problem bings
solution well here I am living in
Nigeria full-time in a country full of
problems
no secrets there but one of our
best-kept secrets is that we&#39;re actually
a country full of solutions very
innovative solutions in my bag I have
three seemingly everyday items but the
three entrepreneurs here in Nigeria
these items are far from everyday first
up I have a potato so too many of us in
this room we&#39;re looking at this potato
and we see french fries we see chips but
to a lobby or loose way he looks at this
potato and this potato signifies power
Alabi creates his own electricity using
potatoes
he&#39;s a hobby scientist and through his
experimentation he realized that by
combining potatoes zinc and copper the
chemical reaction with the potato juices
actually creates electricity six
potatoes can power a reading lamp and
can light up a small room in a lobby&#39;s
house so while you and I we might eat
our chips in the dark a Olivia is
cooking potato power got problem sink
solution
a water bottle waste we have a waste
problem in Nigeria most of us have grown
very complacent to either seeing waste
or tossing waste but not everyone
there&#39;s a young entrepreneur named Tony
joy and in 2013 as an undergraduate
student she created an NGO called we are
mad mad stands for making a difference
and that is exactly what she&#39;s doing
here in Nigeria she has a team
throughout nine states and they help to
rid our streets of our garbage not only
that but they turn our garbage into
beautiful handcrafted items jewelry home
decor even bags from our recyclable
plastic her team has trained over 100
women and children to effectively turn
waste into personal wealth got problem
think solution lastly I have lettuce now
for this example we&#39;re going to pretend
that this is water hyacinth I mean I
have access to it II got problem thing
solution now water hyacinth when they&#39;re
grown controllably it&#39;s actually a very
lovely beautiful plant easy on the eyes
but more often than not they grow
uncontrollably and they grow wild and
that&#39;s when it&#39;s an environmental
problem when you drive over a third
mainland bridge if you look left if you
look right you&#39;ll see masses in masses
of greenery
that&#39;s water hyacinth so we might look
at this is just a pesky weeds but to
Mike organoid and his team they look at
this and they see cooking gas in their
factory here in Nigeria they create
biofuel by extracting ethanol from water
hyacinth bio seal is an affordable
low cost and much safer alternative to
cooking gas got problem things solution
I think we can all agree here that we&#39;ve
reached our tipping points in a country
where fuel no day like no day what I
know day hobby sure we have problems but
if collectively we changed our mindset
and we stop seeing Nigeria as a country
full of problems but really a country
full of opportunity a country full of
solutions waiting to be invented and
implemented will realize that the answer
to many of our problems lie right here
within our own hands within our own
minds and as we&#39;re seeing today with in
this very room we must continue to keep
reminding ourselves got problem
absolutely I thank you
