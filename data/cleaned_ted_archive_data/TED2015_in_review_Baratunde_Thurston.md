I am really glad that Chris set the bar
low at possibly hilarious for this
presentation because I don&#39;t think in
the history of a comedy act one has ever
had to follow redesigning death we&#39;ve
been through a lot this week there&#39;s a
lot to cover I&#39;m going to move rather
quickly we have had over 90 presenters
over 20 hours of mainstage presentations
we&#39;ve each been required to consume 5
pounds per person of single wrapped
vegan snack foods shoved down our
throats
we had to do that this theater is
beautiful the day I walked in I was very
impressed with the wood construction
give it up for the theater until I saw
this from Alaura and I&#39;m no longer
impressed if it&#39;s not bamboo it&#39;s not
 we&#39;re not doing it I&#39;m not doing it
straight lines are for losers losers I
want to give it up for tedactive and the
crew up at Whistler give it up to the
Damned please they are a part of this
I&#39;ll see you guys I have no idea what
you do when we cut away from your feed
so I sent someone I sent my producer and
co-founder Bryan Janos up to Whistler
here&#39;s what it looks like up there just
non-stop sex just non-stop that&#39;s the
active part of tedactive it&#39;s ridiculous
and of course we all come here for the
ideas but we especially come here for
the free material goods who among us
does not remember the line for the gift
cave it was a little something like this
we&#39;re just trying to get a seat here
it&#39;s very very special I represents an
entity known as cultivated wit I am its
co-founder and CEO we take our name from
Horace who said a cultivated wit one
that Badgers less can persuade all the
more and we try to apply the great power
of humor to expand understanding
relatability and make the world a bit
more fun my task here today is to do
that for Ted so welcome to cultivated
wits ted recap let&#39;s go we started off
with a man who took to this stage and
said that his technology was inspired by
an evil machine sent back from the
future to destroy all of us he said the
words out loud himself and I looked at
his face the whole time and he never
smiled you know why because he&#39;s not a
man he&#39;s up 3d printed monster that&#39;s
right that&#39;s right
I see you mr. disome Oh Nick Bostrom
warned us so warned us he told us human
level AI is coming he put up this number
centric chart we have a lot of different
learning styles not everybody is
numerically inclined so we translated
this for you this is what he was really
saying to all of us
and we heard him and we believed him we
were moved by the the solid foundations
of his arguments and then this man came
on stage after him this machine
apologist Oren Etzioni came up here and
said oh nothing to worry about the
machines are our friends the machines
will empower us do you have nothing to
fear from the machines and we didn&#39;t get
to see these two Duke it out face to
face Ted needs more debate so 2016 we&#39;re
proud to announce Ted fights between
these two vostra versus Sione future of
humanity lies in the balance let&#39;s keep
going this was a really really great
moment when our stratospheric jumper
took to the stage and I was just
wondering what is inside of that
spacesuit who is inside of that space
suit it turns out Felix Baumgartner was
inside of that spacesuit he carries him
around like a little trophy waving his
jump in his face it&#39;s great it&#39;s great
Oh Abe Davis you were great you were
great Abe told us how to recover sound
by snooping on plants and other objects
in our life and he expressed surprise
that we would assume this would be used
for surveillance why would you be
surprised you just showed us that the
most pervasive items in the Western
world snack foods are spying on us
move over NSA we got to beware frito-lay
this is not good this is not good Neri
Oxman helen had such a difficult time
trying to capture your brilliance
informal job titles and I can understand
someone who says things like we came up
with our own table of elements editable
biology this the setting for our next
exploration was the Solar System a
wearable digestive system and we mother
earth a person who says that has only
one job title and that is goddess well
done Marriott you rule us all you rule
us all we heard from the presidents of
the Elon Musk fan appreciation society
we laugh cuz we love who told us we&#39;re
going to Mars more specifically a few
thousand of us who can afford the five
hundred thousand dollar one-way ticket I
go into Mars and he also said an amazing
thing about our are no concerns really
that we would travel to Mars with the
earthly problems we&#39;ve so perfected over
the millennia he said this colonists
will settle Mars just the way they came
to America really oh I just see a lot of
like earth to premises setting up
Martian slave colonies and I don&#39;t like
that particular fuchsia I just gotta say
say you laughing love and now for a list
of horrible things we&#39;ve heard on the
Ted stage war with China is come hanging
asteroids are gonna kill us all
antibiotic resistant bacteria is here
implicit bias and racism will get us if
it doesn&#39;t over policing will get us if
it doesn&#39;t under policing will get us if
that doesn&#39;t do it sexual violence or
will it be domestic violence or will it
be violent violence it&#39;s all coming for
us and most of all anything that follows
the phrase what if or just imagine
here&#39;s a rule of thumb if a Ted speaker
says just imagine just don&#39;t a horrible
horrible future is about to unfold in
your mind masquerading as reality a
speaking of masquerades at this very
moment the NCAA March Madness tournament
is on but this room doesn&#39;t really know
much about that because we only had one
talk addressing sports one talk and it
made the great find gladiatorial act of
basketball look like this
well done nerds you I&#39;m Davey go and
wore this this powerful vest which
allows us to extend our senses and I
wondered what does Chris&#39;s vest allow
him to do every sound somebody gives a
TED talk he gets stronger it&#39;s like the
quickening it&#39;s amazing they&#39;ve also
said that this vest would allow us to
feel the Internet as if that were a good
thing let us remember Monica Lewinsky&#39;s
talk the internet is full of heinous and
horrible people who need more empathy so
we propose a solution let us take this
feelings vest
let us trap in internet trolls filled
with hate and subject them to humility
at scale it might look something like
this as a result pretty pretty nasty
stuff and then we the Batman himself a
man whose vision exceeds all of ours he
told us that blind people could hear
everything that&#39;s going on in any room
in the house he told us his sonar gives
him the power to perceive activity
around corners move over frito-lay
Daniel Kish is coming your way that&#39;s
right Batman is coming for you not to
save you not to save you and pop-up
magazine can we give it up for pop-up
magazine I love this they sell out in
five minutes when they do it in San
Francisco and we heard about an
undercover teacher in North Korea we
heard about a brilliant Wall Street
investment strategies behind the bars of
San Quentin prison we heard about so
many things about the two that really
popped out to me if you want a
celebrity&#39;s autograph get that celebrity
to sue you they will have to sign the
paperwork thank you so much Chris milk
and then the best of this session for me
the most memorable Louis Armstrong has
sex tapes Louie Armstrong had sex tapes
thank you Sam green for digging that out
for all of us Chris Burkhart you know
there are there are some ideas which
really do have the power to change the
world and and yours did because you
convinced this black man that he
to go surfing in the Arctic that is a
massive feat which man that was not
desired that ever and now it&#39;s all I
think about
let us discuss art for a moment Marina
Abramovic she showed us her facility
that she&#39;s building in Hudson New York
she had a lot of rooms where people
could experience six hours at a time to
get to the essence of what it meant to
be human she showed us the Crystal Room
but she didn&#39;t show us several other
rooms that we dug up in the process
there&#39;s the blood room naturally there&#39;s
the Seanie room just opens into a
tempest there&#39;s the normal rooms just a
world just get to hang out there for a
while which is really cool it&#39;s pretty
sweet it&#39;s like a fancy Upper West Side
apartment and then there&#39;s the room
that&#39;s populated by blindfolded elite
leaders of the world listening to Marina
Abramovic talk about her rooms room
circular economy it&#39;s pretty great it&#39;s
pretty great now for a list of things
you could only here at Ted you all saw
the cover The Economist from a few weeks
ago of course you did that is an
assumption worth spreading
we saw massive applause for the photos
of baby coral all right everywhere
they&#39;re everywhere
I ran into a physicist in the mall yeah
you did your brain is locked in a vault
of silence of darkness inside your skull
okay that&#39;s true
yep for those of you who were zoning
junkies that works here I was raised by
lesbian wolves in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains
Dustin Galan I believe you when you say
that oh my goodness and then this man
this happened and his name was Chuck
Berry which I was not expecting this
only at Ted Bill Gates is gonna be
available to meet you in the Ebola room

only at 10:00
I&#39;m gonna take a quick water break I&#39;m
gonna show you a video just a little
video and interlude
touching touching
we just had this this very powerful
session we heard the calmest man in the
world tell us to get angry which was
beautiful and and sati Aarti he also has
great accomplishments he freed 83,000
children from child labor and slavery
and it made me reflect on what I&#39;ve done
today I woke up and and when the alarm
went off I didn&#39;t press snooze I just
followed through on that because I
believed in that right anger its idea to
action that was my action today Dame
Ella when your nearest source of help is
in space you are officially a badass
that is the textbook definition of
badass Aloe Blacc you&#39;re the man you&#39;re
the man
you&#39;re the man that was just moving to
tears messed up my makeup thank you so
much for that I was really great and
Sophie the last can we just laugh for
Sophie one more time just some of those
people did sound like they were being
physically injured or try and settle or
duck in to hunt them it was very very
beautiful Roman Mars Rome 99% invisible
very visible on this stage Roman
channeled his inner crotchety old man
you know rant that when the ted.com
people post this online I hope they call
it get your flag off my lawn
we&#39;ve done something very special for
you Roman we noticed that Ted does not
have a flag and so we made one just for
you this is the official official flag
of Ted and here is all the rules we set
forth for us because design matters
Marteen Marteen Marteen Marteen so much
satellite radio he invented that
fatherhood she rocked that cure for a
rare disease she developed that
obsessive desire to preserve her love
for her wife in the form of mind clones
mind files and cryogenics yo stop that
you have us cannot cure disease why do
you have to go make a black mirror
episode out of your test bina48 maybe
what happened to one through 47 we don&#39;t
hear about that we don&#39;t hear about that
and on I&#39;m geared at us where is Anand
is Anand in the room give it up for
honored here tonight this talk about
these two Americas it was beautiful and
I&#39;m proud I&#39;m I&#39;m a friend and I&#39;m so
pleased but it was almost the perfect
TED talk it was all the hair was perfect
it was blessing it was quaffed just so
but you made an interesting choice you
told the Ted audience that they might be
part of the problem you don&#39;t do that at
Ted haven&#39;t you tell the Ted audience
there the totality of the solution there
the exceptional visionaries we have no
future without them next time better
luck so very close so very close
we appreciate you honor they appreciate
you Theaster gates ideas and practice
together he said I believe beauty is a
basic service and it&#39;s true and and Rome
and Mars thought he was talking about
flags when he said that and so he was
very excited about it as well
I just wanted an excuse to show the flag
again so you&#39;re welcome everybody
Sarah Jones Sam Jones you could have
your own week of programming you could
have 45 speakers all played by Sarah
Jones
I would pay $8,500 for it and it will be
worth every dime Sarah
2016 create that make that we will fund
that so good and to close this out
you know the TED Prize was a beautiful
moment that brought us all together we
thought we&#39;d give out our own prizes
these are our cultivated with Ted awards
for the best way to prevent your son
from driving that goes to Chris Urmson
who invented a self-driving car just so
his teenage kid wouldn&#39;t drive himself
that was very creative for the session
that made my job the hardest I want to
give it up to just and unjust for just
having such heart such beauty and if I
made jokes about that session I look
like an asshole and I don&#39;t want to do
that I don&#39;t want to do that the thank
you for not killing us all Award goes to

Padgett that was too long ago we get it
you were in high school you don&#39;t have
to keep showing us those six bags joke
