I saw this photo captured by Daniel bear
who lack in 2010 during the devastating
flooding in Pakistan those long dark
streaks are the shadows of a helicopter
that has just dropped food aid to flood
victims and the crates have smashed open
as they hit the water and the food is
sinking and these people submerged up to
their knees waists necks are rushing to
salvage what they can their movement
transformed by the overwhelming power of
the water I felt this image with my
whole body empathizing immediately not
only because of the horrific situation
depicted but also because of the
uncomfortable beauty of the image itself
it immediately brought to mind Rafael&#39;s
final painting the Transfiguration I
just have to say I loved the Jesus dress
like a Pakistani I had traveled in this
part of the world myself in 2000
trekking through the mountainous
landscapes of my platoon ancestors on
the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan
taking some photos myself ironically of
people who were then were suffering
through a devastating drought and I
remembered these people but a great
distance had since separated me from
that place and I was probably affected
more than I know by 9/11 and the
prejudices of its aftermath but through
this image a great distance within me
was suddenly bridged as a director and
artist this mix of visceral experience
and discomforting beauty is what I
strive to create through my work
for the past three years together with a
team of artists scientists and engineers
I&#39;ve been developing holo scenes a large
performance installation that is a
visceral visual and public collision of
the human body in water sighted in
public plazas or parks or the courtyards
of Arts or science institutions policies
features three large aquarium like
sculptures each inhabited by a single
performer carrying out an everyday
behavior like shopping or cooking filled
and drained by a custom hydraulic system
each aquarium floods with up to 12 tons
of water in less than a minute
transforming the movements of the
performers within now it turns out
simulating a flood safely is tricky so
it&#39;s taken us years of R&amp;D to design our
aquariums the first of which will be
begin being fabricated next month and we
just prototyped our hydraulic system
using an industrial water container to
house performers carrying out some
everyday behaviors that we&#39;ve gathered
from collaborators around the world such
as buying flowers in a mall in Saudi
Arabia or nursing a thermos while
waiting for the Sun to set in Colorado
or making ramen in a dorm kitchen in
Japan as the water rises the performer
swims to the top for air when necessary
and then dives back below to adapt his
behavior to the new aquatic environment
as the water drains he continues soaked
by these mini floods and aware that the
water will soon rise again
aquariums are a lifelong fascination I
love these fabricated transplanted
Ecology&#39;s separated from the viewer only
by a sheet of clear glass that for me
has always paralleled the thin surface
between real and dream space
I&#39;ve often imagined in aquariums
inhabitants peering at me through their
windows to see me on the outside as the
entertainment the imprisoned to
submerged I&#39;m using the aquariums of
hallow scenes to weave the unraveling
story of water the rising seas melting
glaciers intensifying floods and
droughts into the patterns of the
everyday the ebb and flow of water and
the resulting Transfiguration of human
behavior offers an elemental portrait of
our collective myopia persistence and
for better or worse adaptation thank you
