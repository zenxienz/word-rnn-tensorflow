thank you so much for dinner
solar power is scaling up faster than
cellphones for six years running half
the world&#39;s editions of electric
generating capacity have been renewable
and the fastest-growing parts have been
the modular mass-produced renewables
like solar and wind power in each of the
past three years they&#39;ve added over
eighty billion watts and won a quarter
trillion dollars of private investment
so America now has more solar jobs than
we have coal or steel jobs China last
year added more solar power than the
United States has and the year before
China got more electricity from wind
power than from nuclear power nuclear
and coal plants prospects are fading
worldwide because wind and solar power
are cheaper and can also make grids
resilience preventing cascading
blackouts but these modern renewables
also scale up in a fundamentally
different way traditionally we built
giant cathedral-like power plants each
costing billions of dollars in taking
many years to license and build but now
each year you can build a factory that
produces each year thereafter enough
solar cells to generate each year
thereafter as much electricity as your
Cathedral ultimately will so solar
output skills up incredibly quickly mass
producing solar and wind equipment makes
it cheaper so it grows faster so it gets
cheaper so it grows faster in 20 states
today entrepreneurs will put solar power
on your roof with no money down and beat
your utility bill and soon they&#39;ll offer
cashback yet many people still claim but
solar cells and wind power are too
variable to produce much electricity
reliably because we can&#39;t cheaply store
huge amounts for when the Sun doesn&#39;t
shine or the wind doesn&#39;t blow that&#39;s a
myth we do not need a storage
breakthrough we do not need supposedly

24/7 baseload : nuclear power plants to
keep the lights on and here&#39;s why first
variable does not mean unpredictable we
can predict solar and wind power at
least as accurately as demand in this
stormy winter month forecast output from
all the French wind farms almost exactly
match they&#39;re at
you&#39;ll output a day later but also we
secondly we built the electric grid
because no kind of power plant is 24/7
they all break those giant power plants
are shut down about 10 or 12 percent of
the time losing a billion watts maybe in
milliseconds often for weeks or months
often without warning the grid handles
this intermittence by backing up failed
plants with working plants in exactly
the same way but often in lower cost the
grid can manage the for castable
variation of solar and wind power by
combining them with renewables in other
places or of other kinds let me show you
how this can work for example the
isolated Texas grids summer electric
loads can get much smaller and less
peaky with more efficient use profitably
now combining 86% wind and solar power
with 14% other dispatchable renewables
creates surpluses that can charge up I
storage air conditioners and electric
cars and then recovering that
distributed storage when needed and
filling the last gaps with unobtrusively
flexible demand can then deliver 100%
renewable electricity every hour of the
year with only 5% left over using such
choreography
some European countries without adding
bulk stores are already delivering 25 to
58 percent renewable electricity far
more reliable that America&#39;s Iowa and
South Dakota as well are over one fourth
wind powered today so they in Europe
have already far transcended renewable
power supposed reliability limits
whatever exists is possible the National
Renewable Energy Lab is also
choreographed reliable eighty or ninety
percent renewable electricity for the
lower 48 United States
bottom line bulk electricity storage and
fossil fuel backup are the costliest
ways to make the grid more flexible so
we would use them last not first a
breakthrough in cheap bulk storage would
be helpful but not vital we needn&#39;t wait
for it and the market isn&#39;t waiting only
the myth holds us back thank you
you
