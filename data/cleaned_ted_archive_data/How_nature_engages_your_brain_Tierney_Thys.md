well it&#39;s great to be here well you know
we&#39;re always looking for some quick
painless way to focus our brains aren&#39;t
we
coffee Ritalin b12 brain games brain
fitness markets projected to reach six
billion by 2020 well what if I told you
there&#39;s something exists today that
delivers amazing results cheaper with no
side effects
it increases concentration and focus
reduces stress and anxiety it speeds
healing sparks creativity and you can&#39;t
OD on this stuff
what is this amazing substance well II
Oh Wilson tells us and his theory of
Biophilia that just being surrounded by
bountiful nature rejuvenates and
inspires us who I feel better already
now nature&#39;s calming healing effects was
formally investigated by Roger Ulrich a
psychologist in the 1980s and he found
that Haase patients whose hospital rooms
looked out on trees had faster healing
rates and requested fewer strong pain
medication then patients whose whose
windows looked out on brick walls you
know personally I wouldn&#39;t want to be
hock and percocet in this new skyscraper
going up in Milan Italy but you know
what I find really interesting is that
just staring out at nature does
something mysterious to our minds and
bodies last year I started working with
Nalini Nadkarni another TED speaker and
we started putting nature imagery into
the exercise yard of an Oregon prison
talk about nature deprivation at its
most extreme and we&#39;ve gotten some
pretty remarkable preliminary results
and what&#39;s equally exciting is this
growing number of compassionate prison
staff members willing to give this
simple tactic ago to lower inmate
violence
aggression what a potentially cool
low-cost tool for our incarceration
nation that houses 2.3 million inmates
many of them suffering from mental
illness and destined to be repeat
offenders now you know speaking of
incarceration most of us don&#39;t really
get out all that much either
as of 2010 humans have officially become
an urban species and the average
American spends 90% of their time
indoors 90% so granted you know cities
do have their nature Bob that&#39;s for you
but we you know by and large we have
become very separated from the
landscapes and seascapes we evolved from
so could nature imagery maybe help
defray that growing deficit and if so
how well we know from fMRI studies that
measure blood flow to the brain but
there&#39;s a particular region of the brain
that processes scenes and scenery
actually this is work that is Nancy
kanwisher who&#39;s he&#39;ll be presenting
tomorrow don&#39;t miss it and we also know
that the brain responds differently to
rural and urban imagery and we know that
the right amygdala fires up in response
to watching animals imagery you know I
had to get the mola in there somehow but
there&#39;s so much more we don&#39;t know for
instance which habitats best stimulate
or comas is habitat preference in the
eye of the beholder or is it hard wired
into the hominid brain as many
evolutionary psychologists suggest if we
had answers to questions like these we
could optimize the creation of nature
imagery to maximize its social and
therapeutic good and that&#39;s what we&#39;re
doing with pilot funds from National
Geographic have teamed up with Nalini
Nadkarni and tanley and we&#39;re using
mobile
g&#39;head sets to measure brain dynamics in
response to different biomes and we&#39;re
using beautiful imagery like this shot
by Louis Schwartzberg and David Hannon
and others in 4k this is all part of a
new field
I&#39;m calling neuro Biophilia the science
of how nature engages the brain of
course it&#39;s always better to be out in
real nature but sometimes it&#39;s just not
possible so for all those times we&#39;re
separated from the wild be it in
hospitals nursing homes office buildings
space stations supermax prisons we&#39;re
hoping that this kind of research can
help provide that one well guided touch
of nature to reconnect us all thank you
it&#39;s amazing can you like how would you
imagine this kind of tool could you know
might be used for somebody suffering
from depression or PTSD I mean what
would traditionally be well I think you
know now we can capture nature with such
incredible resolution I mean to the
limits of the resolution of the human
eye and so there&#39;s so much information
that we can draw on but we don&#39;t know
how exactly how to optimize it for
particulars like for someone who&#39;s
depressive or someone and so so we can
we can look at that and see if we can it
can be optimized to particular disorders
like exposure therapy exposure therapy
and then also we&#39;re looking at audio as
well so with sound without sound I mean
the questions you can ask our are so
numerous but but nature nature imagery
as a therapeutic tool I think is really
untapped journey thank you so much thank
you
