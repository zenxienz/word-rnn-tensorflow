I don&#39;t know what you do for a living
but I have the best work in the world
I teach teenagers now if you have raised
a teenager and think that I might need
to undergo some psychiatric testing let
me remind you that I can&#39;t raise their
allowance or extend their curfew and
thankfully I don&#39;t have to get them out
of bed in the morning but I do get to
enjoy their curiosity and their passion
their energy to take on the world and
let&#39;s be honest some of them are
squirrely goofballs I am so lucky to be
a teacher I get the chance every day to
give kids high-fives and to celebrate
with them and laugh with them I get to
help kids find their voice and through
literature discuss the beauty and
challenges of the human condition I get
the chance every day to help kids see
who they are and who they want to be but
this is more than work that I am lucky
to do this is work that I have to do I
was all set for the smooth and narrow
road I was born a middle-class white
male to college-educated parents growing
up in the suburbs but quickly that path
took turns and detours divorce broke our
household alcoholism broke relationships
my mom&#39;s death broke my heart and then
unemployment left us straight broke I
would lay awake at night in my
brokenness doubting that I was destined
to have a bright future and sometimes
darker thoughts than that so I am
intimately aware that while teenagers
are curious and
passionate they are also often
overwhelmed and unsure one in five
teenagers faces depression nearly half
of the children in this country will
face some form of severe adversity or
trauma during their childhood and over
16 million children live in families
that struggle to put food on the table
how can someone excel in high school
trigonometry and chemistry and
literature how can they further their
education how can they consider their
contribution to the greater good when
they are facing so much of life with so
few resources we do it when we don&#39;t
have to go at it alone in my childhood
and for so many children in this country
hope rests in the hearts of teachers
mr. Reagan never pride or prodded for
why some of us wanted to stay at school
until 8 o&#39;clock at night he just met us
with a warm smile and a laugh that could
fill the room
mr. shirts didn&#39;t didn&#39;t dig into the
underlying reasons why I had earned poor
grades he simply told me that he wasn&#39;t
going to lower his expectations because
the world out there wasn&#39;t going to
lower theirs either but if I put in the
effort he would meet me every step of
the way
Rita Pearson told us that every child
needs a champion and that is absolutely
true teachers become that champion when
we come to see our role not just as a
distributor of content but as an
unconditional partner in learning a
caring and abiding presence in the life
of a child who commits to show that
child love first and then to teach them
to love learning the joy inherent in the
process of learning I think about
Breanna who entered our high school as a
9th grader in the avid college readiness
program that meant that she came from
the academic middle that meant that she
had a dream to go to and be the first in
her family to graduate from college by
her advancement via individual
determination and it meant that she was
counting on me to be her teacher through
all four years of high school because
our avid teachers loop with students
from ninth grade to 10th and then on to
11th and 12th grade to ensure that they
have a relationship with a caring
supportive educator who they can deeply
trust
that first year went well
Brianna was just like dozens of children
that you probably know she was shy but
kind and responsible she earned good
grades and was pleasant to be around
she came back for 10th grade and
something had changed she was bitter
angry she was apathetic about academics
and her grades had just plummeted out of
nowhere almost inexplicably it was like
she was a different person have you ever
had a teenager upset with you it is not
what I would call a pleasant experience
face looks like they&#39;re smelling garbage
and they&#39;ve got a piece of it caught in
their throat
Oh
those are the days when I don&#39;t enjoy my
work quite as much those are the days
when it takes a lot more vulnerability
to show a student compassion but those
are also the days when they need us the
most
I was lost on what to do for Brianna
being pleasant was dismissed jokes were
not funny
ever the truth was Brianna was lost
herself and I could almost see the door
of opportunity closing right in front of
her and I just refused to let that
happen
halfway through the year at my wits ends
I decided to just sit down and write her
a letter I thought about what I still
loved about her her throw back cultural
tastes her unique sense of humor and
independent nature and somewhere in
there was still a caring heart I was
sure I thought about the future that she
could have and I wrote to her about all
the positive possibilities that I saw
for her I gave her that letter
the school counselor started to work
with her her grandmother continued to be
a constant presence in her life and over
time Brianna began to turn it around and
it was wonderful to witness over time
Brianna overcame the depression an
eating disorder that was just consuming
her we worked together the next two and
a half years to help her improve her
grades to find her passion to give her
the skills and habits that she would
need to make her dream come true and
today Brianna is a sophomore on a
four-year college campus happy healthy
and studying to become a teacher
you know Brianna&#39;s story is her own but
I and teachers across this country could
share soul wrenching stories of
devastating teenage years many far more
extreme and that is the core reason why
so many of us have come to see our job
as one that requires us to love first
and then teach why I see my role as to
be a child&#39;s teammate in learning and in
life from the first day they walk into
my classroom until the day they walk
across that graduation stage and
sometimes well beyond that because
however hard that walk might be for me
their walk is so much more difficult so
often so when kids walk into our schools
caring counts it matters Parker Palmer
told us that the enemy of learning is
not ignorant but fear fear of personal
failure fear of being vulnerable and
labeled not good enough not smart enough
fear of an unknown future unabated fear
stalks learning in its tracks
because we are all emotional beings and
so it&#39;s the courage to care even when
caring is the hard choice that helps us
make a difference and help kids launch
beautiful lives and so as we approach
kids in our classroom we have to
remember that the degree to which
students feel cared for and supported
should be a part of every school&#39;s
evaluation that school climate should
drive school Progress plans because how
we feel about the places where we spend
our days and the value of our work is
what drives engagement and effort and
that is what drives
Cheeseman
and so maybe that means that teachers
loop with students from multiple grade
levels even in high school to ensure
that they have that relationship of
support and Trust maybe that means that
we have policies that bring student
voice and feedback to teachers more
often so that we can help improve our
practice with their voice but I think it
also means when we think about teacher
practice and care it has to mean more
than high-fives and stickers and notes
of encouragement those are good things
we should do those things but it also
has to mean designing learning that is
so compelling and empowering that school
becomes the best 7 hours of a kid&#39;s day
it means committing to care for children
simply because they exist not because
they have somehow earned our care and it
means that we commit to care for every
single child in a way that is so driven
from our core beliefs when we think
about a revolution in education we have
to remember to put hearts before
hardware we have to remember that it&#39;s
relationships that improve data reports
and we have to remember that a true
education gives every child the
foundation of security and strength and
significance when we talk about a
revolution in education we have to
remember that we want every child to
achieve that we want to come to a world
where we say that not one more time will
a door of opportunity closed on any
student because we have educators that
are driven in their souls by core
beliefs to care for children that not
one more door of opportunity closes on
any child not one more time not on our
watch thank you so much
you
