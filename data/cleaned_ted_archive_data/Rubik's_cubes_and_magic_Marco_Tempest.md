sure that everyone in the room
recognizes this the Rubik&#39;s Cube most of
you have probably played with it but I&#39;m
also guessing that not quite as many of
you were able to solve it earlier Rubik
created this puzzle in the 1970s and
it&#39;s spread like wildfire books were
written competition staged record set
experts were interviewed it&#39;s probably
the most recognizable puzzle of the 20th
century and it is as popular and
challenging today as when it first
appeared the cube became part of the
culture an iconic design that is now
recognized all over the world so I
brought some cubes with me so for your
job is not to solve them
