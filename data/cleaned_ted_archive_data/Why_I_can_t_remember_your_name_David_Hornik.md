so a few months ago I brought my dad by
my office so he could meet some of my
coworkers and as I introduced him to my
friend Lila I realized that I had
forgotten the name of the woman who was
standing next to her which was a little
bit embarrassing seeing as I&#39;d worked
hand in hand with this woman for the
last 11 years
and so while Lila and my dad chatted I
worked desperately to try and remember
her name is it Susan or Mary or Kirsten
and and and just as my heartbeat was
racing and I and I figured lost hope her
name popped into my head and I thought
oh thank goodness and I introduced my
dad to Diane and I breathed this huge
sigh of relief and just then around the
corner walked our new receptionist of
three years and there was no chance that
I was going to remember her name and so
over the next ten minutes I tried
desperately to come up with it to no
avail and eventually I slinked into my
office feeling defeated and a few hours
later I was sitting on an airplane and I
was thinking about this this situation
and feeling terrible that I hadn&#39;t been
able to make a connection between these
two people who I care deeply about and
as I sat on this plane I actually
started to cry which was a little
surprising particularly for those
sitting next to me but the surprising
part wasn&#39;t that I had forgotten their
names in fact I forget people&#39;s names
every day I forget the names of friends
and co-workers and loved ones every day
of every week of every year and for the
longest time I thought this was normal I
thought that this was at least normal
for someone with a crappy memory but it
turns out that it isn&#39;t it turns out
that that it&#39;s directly a byproduct of
my dyslexia and the same broken piece of
my brain that that is in charge of
interpreting written language is also in
charge of remembering what people call
themselves and it does an equally
terrible job of both and so as I sat on
this airplane I realized that the
challenge with dyslexia is that it&#39;s
it&#39;s an invisible disability that when I
forget your name you just think I&#39;m an
idiot
or I&#39;m a jerk you don&#39;t you don&#39;t know
that I have this disability I don&#39;t
carry a
I don&#39;t have a hearing aid I&#39;m not
sitting in a wheelchair and and so you
assume the worst and I and dyslexia is
not the only hidden disability the only
an invisible disability out there there
are millions of people with OCD or
bipolar disorder or or are on the
spectrum they have Asperger&#39;s and they
experience this same thing every day
where people make certain assumptions
about them based on their behavior
without understanding or appreciating
the underlying cause and as I said
thought about it I realized that I was
as guilty of this as anyone and so since
that time I&#39;ve I&#39;ve tried hard to give
people the benefit of the doubt when
there&#39;s more than one explanation for
the way that they&#39;re behaving and I&#39;m
hopeful that people will give me that
benefit that is out and so towards that
end I know that I&#39;ve I&#39;ve known many of
you for a very long time and over the
course of the rest of this week some of
you are gonna catch me glancing down at
your nametag and I just want to say here
and now I still love you I just can&#39;t
remember your name
thank you
[Applause]
