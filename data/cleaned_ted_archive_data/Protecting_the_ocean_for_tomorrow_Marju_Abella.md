we spend a lot of time talking about the
problems facing our oceans acidification
pollution overfishing and while those
are very big problems there is still
hope hope to restore fisheries and the
livelihood of the people who depend on
them the tope depends not just what is
happening on a global level but also in
the communities along our coastlines and
it all starts with a few small changes I
am from the Philippines it is a country
made up of 7,107 islands within the
Coral Triangle we are known for a great
food incredible spirit and ability to
have fun and I can assure you it truly
is more fun in the Philippines you have
the most amazing oceans just off our
coast
where the center of the center the
Earth&#39;s marine biodiversity with over
two thousand fish species 600 coral
species whales dolphins whale sharks and
more filling our waters it is a truly
incredible and beautiful place but it is
also facing an oceanic crisis my
community the municipality of valuing
has long seen the problem people in my
town are mostly farmers and fishers
these fissures and their families depend
on the sea for the income and the
sustenance yep year after year they
catch fewer fish there&#39;s less fish out
there my grandfather used to tell me
that our seas were so rich that one
could scoop a bucket and come home is a
bounty today it is not so that is a
lesson I learned while spending some
time with the local Fisher Billy Alberto
three years ago
I went out on a boat with Billy Alberto
Billy is a typical Fisher from my
village he&#39;s 46 married with four
children a devout Roman Catholic and has
spent much of his life in a boat just
off our coast
since his father taught him to fish over
the next three hours
we got three small fish fish he
explained
were scarce fishers regularly used
illegal methods
just cyanide and dynamite in order to
mr. fish catch it would also include
that to our marine sanctuaries uncut the
marker boys delineated along the area in
order to increase the fishing grounds if
only they weren&#39;t his friends Billy said
he would deport them but this fishermen
and Fisher women are not bad people
they&#39;re simply trying to make a living
and feed their families they&#39;re the sons
cousins friends with inner a human
family it&#39;s easy to blame the fishers
after all they&#39;re the ones doing the
fishing but instead we must engage the
whole communities and change your ways
the problem was and is always finding
out how that works then my organization
heard about this international
conservation organization named rare the
passive formula for creating social
movements by helping the local
communities take pride in their local
natural resources this effort engages
the fishers as well as the whole
community to take care of the sea just
as they would take care of their
children to see this resources as
uniquely theirs and vulnerable to be
lost if aren&#39;t protected the SE became a
conservation fellow a local leader who
uses traditional marketing strategies in
order to inspire pride and change how
the Fisher&#39;s fish this is where things
get tricky
after all I was not a marketer how would
I know the formula for influencing
behaviour rare straining help I started
by talking with the community during one
of my conversations I met Eduardo
balonus a notorious dynamite Fisher who
was offended several times by the
authorities but still he did not stop he
did not see when he should change his
face after all wasn&#39;t it still erased to
fish and feed our families I also met
Oliver the U by one of the guards
voluntarily guarding our marine
sanctuaries
time and time again he would risk his
their life in order to protect what he
calls his treasure this conversations
with Eduardo Billy and Oliver helped my
behavior change campaign I created the
holistic approach based on social and
biological science
I also work with Visser organizations to
create a more effective management
committee we mock out the marine
sanctuaries build enforcement teams to
ensure no one entered and use basic
science to keep track of official play
this fishers then help serve as key
influencers to change the social norms
around fishing in a human my marketing
campaign also targeted on other people
and messages that were designated I
carefully identified who the key
influencers of my target audiences were
for example for Billy a devout Roman
Catholic a local piece for Eduardo his
peers for others their families and
friends my conversation with Oliver the
you PI on risking his life to protect
our marine resources guided my messaging
I could still remember every word he
uttered I will risk my life over and
over again for something that gives me
life I am a father to three fisherman
sons what will become of them fish
stocks will continue to drop we must
protect our resources for generations to
come
and thus that became the root of our
tagline well I&#39;m goin Karen gasps a sack
of my own
or we let our nature flourish today so
you have something to be pissed there
future generations Fisher&#39;s like Eduardo
Billy and Oliver all sort of fishing as
a family tradition while I focus on the
Fisher&#39;s the second part of my marketing
campaign targeted the broader community
who could pressure them to fish properly
a carefully customized mascot just as
brands and universities create a mascot
to share a message and build pride I
together with their local Fisher&#39;s in
indie band chose the raccoon
butterflyfish a fish with which the
community could connect and name him
Louis of course II - needed to be
carefully tested one of my first focus
groups told me that my cigarettes look
like a rice and that my fish look like a
frog the countless revisions led me to
the final version labeled by one Fisher
as the most beautiful fish
ever seen I also work with children the
next liners of this earth and a key
influencer group during various school
visits we knew they would go home and
ask daddy why aren&#39;t you taking care of
the sea so I can be like you and finish
one day we also targeted all the sectors
in the community during various
community activities mural painting
coastal cleanups basketball tournaments
and more all to get the people engaged
and change the social norms Arnhem
fishing in a human over time I saw how
my efforts built the social legal and
management structures that influence
change and water Fisher&#39;s - feeling part
of a community and a greater cause
indeed humanity is both the cause and
the solution to environmental problems
over the three years
we have seen our fish stocks increase to
a nearly full metric tonne this results
are incredibly motivating for us
community knowledge and wider marine
sanctuaries are powerful increased from
just over 25 percent to over 60 percent
90 percent of the Fisher&#39;s believe that
no one should be fishing in those areas
and since you&#39;ve started working fishers
have reported that their fish catch have
gone up we know we still have a lot of
things to do but these results are first
up and now we are slowly being
recognized across the country as we are
now part of the top 12 well-managed
marine protected area out of the 1,800
in the Philippines
but far more important and drunking is
seeing total strangers working as when
enemies becoming friends people caring
more for the environment and changing
their ways
so the generations to come could still
live in a world where fishing is still
possible
I can now stand on the same shoreline
where I won so Fisher&#39;s destroying the
reefs and see the same ones protecting
it that is my own sense of pride I am
NOT alone in this journey I&#39;m just one
of the many conservation fellows working
in the Philippines and around the globe
in order to protect our marine resources
we&#39;re slowly transforming the
Philippines and serving as a model to
other countries and communities we are
the Philippines we are proud of our
country our people in the land and the
seas that are uniquely ours
