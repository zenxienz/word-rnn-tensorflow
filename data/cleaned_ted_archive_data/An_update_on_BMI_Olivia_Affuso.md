so let me tell you a story about my
friend who was a college football player
in Division one back in the 1990s he
still said but he&#39;s a big guy tall and
muscular and proportionately he has more
fat he has more muscle than he has fat
which is a good thing so earlier this
year he decided that he was going to run
the Mercedes marathon in Birmingham
Birmingham Alabama he had trained for
several months and on race day it was
cold outside and as he came through one
of the eight stations he stepped on a
piece of ice and he fell injuring his
knee after completing the race he tried
the usual rest ice compression and
elevation but nothing happened nothing
helped so as primary care for doctor his
primary care doctor quickly referred him
to an orthopedic surgeon and when he
called to make his appointment he was
told that the doctor doesn&#39;t see
patients with the BMI over 35 that&#39;s
body mass index or weight divided by
height so his BMI was 36 this makes
absolutely no sense for an otherwise fit
and healthy person to not receive the
care they need so after pleading his
case of being fit and otherwise healthy
with no his
three of arthritis he was allowed to see
a an orthopedic nurse practitioner who
ordered an MRI on his knee
the MRI of course showed that he had a
torn meniscus so it took three months
for him to receive the care that he
needed and seven months later he&#39;s still
in pain as an academic researcher
specializing in obesity reduction
through diet and exercise I hear about
this kind of thing far too often there
are many other individuals who are being
denied access to medical care because
BMI incorrectly classifies them as
having an unhealthy weight for instance
it can also be misleading in the
opposite direction suggesting that
patients or normal when otherwise they
are clearly sick take anorexia for
example which is a life-threatening
illness characterized by self starvation
and extreme fear of being overweight and
actually having a low body weight but
many of these patients are denied
medical treatment by their insurance
companies because their BMIs are not low
enough and too many people suffering
from anorexia fail to fall below the BMI
or 15 even though they are severely ill
obviously this frustrates me as a person
but also as a scientist who&#39;s been
working very hard to overcome and
counteract the obesity epidemic that we
have in this country so I set out to
find an alternative method to BMI not
only for myself
but also for other scientists and
physicians trying to improve the lives
of others the new method needed to be an
easy portable relatively inexpensive way
to measure body fatness so how about
pictures after all most of us are
carrying around a small camera in our
pockets known as a smartphone so a few
years ago I started working on an
alternative method using digital
photography to measure body fatness from
photographs of course this idea of using
photos to measure the body is not new
back in the 1930s scientists had the
idea to measure body volume the actual
physical shape that the body takes up
which along with weight could be used to
determine body fatness but their efforts
were limited by a lack of technology and
even tried using elements of mapmaking
to determine the curves of the human
body but this was too complicated
fast-forward 80 years and we now have
the necessary tools and technology
available to us because of the evolution
in digital photography which allows us
to take high-quality photographs with
cameras that are very small costing less
than 30 bucks or even new cell phone
camera add to this my personal
experience of learning to tell a
person&#39;s body fatness with a fair degree
of accuracy just slide looking at them
so we wanted to see if we could train a
computer to do that - so my colleagues
and I aim to develop a way to automate
the process of transforming digital
photographs into accurate estimates of
body fatness first we needed to decide
on the best method to test the accuracy
of our method of body fatness so we
chose the full body DEXA scan that moves
quickly from head to toe and produces a
high quality estimate of muscle bone in
fact but the DEXA is very expensive and
not particularly portable then using two
simple digital photographs we created a
3d model of the human body that allowed
us to capture volume from the pictures
we then coupled the visible the visible
cues of a person&#39;s body to get at their
shape which allowed us to have more
information about their body fatness all
of this was done automatically by a
computer and the combination of these
elements gave us the information that we
needed to accurately predict body
fatness so well how well does our method
work using pictures from hundreds of men
women and children we found that our
estimates of body fat were similar to
those from the DEXA scan we also found
that our results were better at
correctly classifying people&#39;s level of
obesity compared to BMI when the BMI was
compared to DEXA and we&#39;re not the only
group working to develop alternatives to
the BMI there is a team in the UK that
has been working on a 3d scanning tool
to measure body volume
and linking that information to health
outcomes or illnesses several other
groups have come together to discover
new ways to use technology to solve some
of the other problems of obesity maybe
you have heard that the pear shape is
healthier than the output shape because
there&#39;s more fat around the waist and
that fat is linked to negative health
outcomes such as heart disease but BMI
tells us nothing about that so we can
apply new relatively inexpensive
technology in ways that were once
unavailable to us ways that could change
the lives of millions but it&#39;s not just
about the technology it&#39;s about changing
the mindsets of diet of doctors and
scientists who have settled for a
limited measure that doesn&#39;t serve us
all our hope is that by pairing digital
photographs and computer analysis we can
do just that
so let&#39;s move beyond the BMI so that
everyone can get the personalized health
care that they deserve
after all almost none of us are average
thank you
