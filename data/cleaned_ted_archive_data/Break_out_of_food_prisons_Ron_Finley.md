Ted you know let&#39;s make some noise yeah
yeah I&#39;m a criminal I know it&#39;s hard to
believe looking at me but I am I planted
a garden in South Central Los Angeles
wound up having a warrant out for my
arrest for planting carrots
planting food what this what this turned
into let me ask you this first who in
here has a garden who in here grows
their own food who eats out of their
garden
okay we&#39;re gonna go for 100% we got to
change that I want everybody in here
when you leave here to have a garden I
want you to go home and plant a garden
why because it empowers you why because
that garden everything starts in the
garden all of life starts in the garden
okay what what when people ask me why
did I why did I put this gardener what
was my inspiration my inspiration it was
heart disease asthma type two diabetes
diabetes cancer and all these other
ailments and diseases that can be
treated with food and the biggest
disease of all is the disease of lack of
opportunity in my communities and I
wanted to change this so from this we
were able to have the laws changed where
you can now grow food in your Parkway
the strip of land where I put my garden
in Los Angeles California so people want
to know how and where to start and I
tell them you start at the beginning and
they like where is that I said wherever
you start it&#39;s the citroen it&#39;s the
simplest thing
I mean gardening is it&#39;s easy just all
you need is water seed and soil that&#39;s
all you need
and it&#39;s you need to start feeding
yourself we all need to start doing this
my garden has has translated been
translated all over the world I got kids
in India they calling themselves
gangster gardeners now because of a TED
talk that I did it&#39;s going to take us to
change our communities okay somebody&#39;s
some of these communities I call them
food prisons okay because you have to
literally break out of them to get any
kind of healthy food I got tired of
seeing that happen I got tired of seeing
young people young people winding up in
the morgue young people riding up in the
prison industrial complex which I call
the justice system so we gardening you
can change this regarding you can&#39;t
empower yourself what I want you to do
is realize that you can&#39;t design your
own life okay don&#39;t let some other
clowns design your life for you you need
to take it up on yourself and design
your own life and this is what I did
with my garden my garden has everything
from bananas and strawberries and apples
and oranges and watermelons and in
collard greens I can&#39;t seem to figure
out why the watermill watermelons and
the collard greens they always come up
missing I don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t know maybe
he&#39;s got something me doing you know the
fact that I&#39;m in South Central
you know I don&#39;t know I mean these these
are these are bees that just they&#39;ve
been it they&#39;ve been in my house for
like two years they just decided to take
over this trash camp what I want you
guys to do is realize that it all starts
from art everything is art okay when you
when you even designing your life is art
okay you don&#39;t you can&#39;t recreate your
life whenever you want it at every turn
that you have and that&#39;s what you need
that&#39;s what we need
do what I would like everybody in this
room to do is when you leave here the
side on this is how I what I want my
life to be this is how I want to change
my life and you can do that with
gardening gardening is the gateway for
you to design and your life and it
affects and enhances every part of your
life every part eating healthy food we
need to have these schools redesign
where the the school the is inside the
garden not the garden inside the school
all of life happens in the garden that&#39;s
where our lessons come from I have these
these um these preschool kids they come
in the garden and they uh they eat
literally shrunk right from the soil
they that&#39;s gonna change their whole
outlook on further unfold and their
reaction to food for the rest of their
life what I want was what I want you i
want to ha let you guys i want to spit
some game at you for a minute girls love
flowers I don&#39;t know why they just love
some flower plant flowers okay I want
everybody I want all of us so when you
