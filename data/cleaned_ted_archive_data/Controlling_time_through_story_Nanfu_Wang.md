time for me has always been an adversary
my life has been about defiant I&#39;m in my
work animal life of sin how moment can
squeeze and dilate and how in the span
of a moment the entire course of a life
can change three years ago I was in
China making a documentary film called
hooligans Pharaoh I had been following
some of the most courageous women&#39;s
rights activist tea in China led by a
woman named ali IBN also known as
hooligan sparrow they stay to the public
protest against the school principal in
the government official who had the
raped six young girls but at the time
the government was covering up the crime
ficient is effectively banned in china
the government reacted to the protest
with an intense wave of harassment
intimidation arresting the activists
tradin them across the country I was
there with them for every moment
documented net with my camera in some
cases a hidden camera simply by being
present was the activist I too became a
target of the government the police
compass cleared my camera they
intermitted it and harass my family and
friends and eventually three national
security agents came and they
interrogated me for five hours
ultimately I talked my way out of the
interrogation and made it out to the US
but that moment of the interrogation
remains in my mind in that moment the
hours felt like years and how a handle
that could potentially change my entire
life moments like that have shaped my
perception of the time I&#39;d like to share
with you a story from my child
when I first became aware of time I grew
up in a small remote village in China
where the highest education in that
village was elementary school when I was
9 my parents had to send me away to the
boarding school in the city sending me
away was hard on my parents but for me
it was devastating my father was my best
friend when I left home my only means of
communicating with him was through the
long letters we wrote to each other and
during their summer vacation I would go
back to visit and spend as much time as
I could with my father even as a child I
knew that my father my time with my
father was really spent precious because
when September came admission back to
the boarding school in the summer of
nineteen ninety-seven I was 11 one night
I woke up around two o&#39;clock in the
morning and saw my dad sitting on the
couch I asked him why he was up at such
a late hour he didn&#39;t answer he didn&#39;t
turn to look at me I woke my mom she
called his name she SAT there
expressionless I didn&#39;t know what was
happening I put a pen in his hand hoping
that he could communicate with me
through writing is what we did when we
were apart from each other I let go of
the pen in his hand it fell through his
fingers and down to the floor I stood
there watching him as my mom ran to find
help at that time we didn&#39;t own a car
and there were no telephones in our
village my mom went to friends houses
hoping to find someone who could take my
father to a hospital eventually we found
a car and care with my father into the
back seat to begin the 100-mile journey
to the nearest hospital
when we got to the hospital we learned
that his brain was hemorrhaging at the
point the doctor gave my mom two options
without a procedure to stop the bleeding
he would die within 24 hours attempt to
bring surgery he might survive but you
might also died during the surgery
process because of his history of heart
disease the time to make that decision
was really limited my mom chose to get
them operate the surgery was eight hours
long I waited at the hospital together
with my mom I could feel the weight of
those eight hours of play slowly past
the vividness of my memory of those
hours still surprises me I remember
hearing the gurney approaching doctors
and nurses talking and hoping that you
will be my father&#39;s currently coming but
you never happened he didn&#39;t survive the
surgery he was 33 years old and I was 11
in the tradition of our village they
brought him back in the late him on the
floor of our home he would lie there for
three days under a white sheet
surrounded by candles as people filed in
and out for a final visit I spent each
of those three days Neil and down in
front of him I stared out of his face
his body for hours and hours hoping that
I could notice more movement and his
muscles or in his eyes I thought about
our special ways of communicating maybe
all the people who said he was dead just
didn&#39;t know our secret and I was the
only one who knew that he didn&#39;t die on
the third day they put him in the coffin
and buried him in the ground
I cried in a way I never had not because
that he was dead and gone and I&#39;m us but
because I imagined he was alive I
thought those people have chopped him in
the box and he would be cold starved and
supplicated I thought the people who
buried my father had murdered him
gradually I came to understand what
happened I realized that the prison
could die at 33 years old and that death
is random and can come for any person at
any time in the years that followed I
became convinced that the same thing
happened to my father would happen to me
I believed that I would die when I
turned 33 the timeline for my life was
suddenly condensed and the way I saw the
world would never be the same time has
manipulated me into looking alive
differently I became determined to love
each minute as if there were two minutes
to love each day as if there were two
days so that I couldn&#39;t at the time that
have been taken away from my father I
decided that I was going to live my life
as if I will live in for both myself and
for my father my desire to live more
than one life grew over the years I
found a way to put myself through
vocational training then different jobs
Ben college and then gradual schools but
it wasn&#39;t until two thousand eleven when
I came to the US I discovered
documentary films initially I recognized
the medium as a way to take control of
time to manipulate it to multiply it
documentary films allow audiences to
visit places the big never been to and
to hear about people and ideas and
cultures that they&#39;ve never heard of
but for documentary filmmakers this
experiences a physically real when I&#39;m
shooting in the field I live with my
subjects I get into their minds when I
was making hooligans barrel I lived with
the Chinese a human rights activist for
three months together we went to the
protest and we were forced to flee from
one city to another across the country
to avoid the police harassment their
experience became mine Alyssa to a
degree and on another project I followed
the lives of a homeless prison on the
streets of a Florida in the left his
lifestyle I ate out of a garbage cans
and slept on the sidewalk in order to
bring my subjects stories to life I love
their life lifes that are different from
mine in this way every time I make a
film the film also makes me and not
spending time and I&#39;m not working I&#39;m
still in time and i&#39;m earning time
documentary filmmakers can also control
time during the editing process we can
choose to face any moment in time to
carefully study and then we can skip
days or years or generations forward in
an instant before settling on another
moment to study there are chicks that
storytellers use to play with time we
can slowly down we can speed it up we
can flash back we can flash forward and
when eventually a film is finished with
sharing it with an audience is his own
experience in time traveling the
audience rise along with the story
traveling through time as naturally as
they would travel from one point on a
map to another it&#39;s through storytelling
the time temporarily loses grip on us
and on our perception of the world in
being a filmmaker I&#39;m very fortunate to
have
this extra dimension of choosing any
moment in time to study with the subject
and then eventually with an audience I&#39;m
grateful for this and for finally
finding the way to be in charge of time
thank you
I
