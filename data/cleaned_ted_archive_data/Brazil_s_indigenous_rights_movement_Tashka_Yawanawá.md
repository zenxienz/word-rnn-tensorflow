needed for amazon can speak english i
see i can be you with without losing Who
I am and I&#39;m and that that colonization
try to farm indigenous people you know

into that and that brings a lot of
genocide in at messiah and al saleh bc
is for indigenous people because follow
bc that we know how to cure we have our
medicinal plants and we use to Kira p
but like in cases amazon like when I&#39;m
Elias come to the Amazon they keep a lot
people because they don&#39;t know how to
treat that and that kind of disease q a
lot indigenous peoples and that make
indigenous people slowly like today this

rights amen in the state people they
don&#39;t have idea about the right about
their lanes the bigger Rangers can
invited the land and then logging
companies they can t their energies
those people and some students come to
the cities and they start coming

jaan doesn&#39;t faze indigenous the union
of indigenous people and they come to
all leaders differently despite of the
zoo they come together organize some
manifestation and advocacy like to
Brazil some powder they are organizing
they should arrive in this movement for
fight for their land and also in 1988
about to start to 13 change that because
the laws of 1973 at the year of I I
bought that say indigenous people living
under tutela like once that means that

you are choosing you are not response
for yourself you cannot do anything you
cannot think about your future you
depend upon I when I a national indian
foundation for anything you want to do
and what we are we are we are say that
that flow is very old now indigenous

the yellow an hour you can see it on my
people and the yarn our we use our land
for hunt and fish every day like we
don&#39;t have a McDonald in the corner you
don&#39;t have a Walmart we have the
rainforest we hunt and we fish every day

rainforest and not just for indigenous
people and for every human being when
you walk in and enter and the voice you
feel peace and harmony because they&#39;re
everything to star ever ever human
beings connect with the nature and we
have it is linked it with the nature for
the hour an hour
the length means life and is where we
find the medicine when somebody seek
they come to the shaman and sharma they
push you to tell him why the dreamer in
the last month or last days we can go
view interpretation if he has spiritual
disease he is going to pray for you if
you are physical these physics is going
give you the medicine if because we are
now I believe when you seek because your
body and you saw and was not in
hammering is the fourth where we can we
can we can get our a medicine and also
we have this red color we that you pay a
repaint of patient embodied when were
Yellin our pain painting his face or
body they want to show health happiness
and beauty and we do that once somebody
paint you they painting you in
accordance with you so sometimes linky
with a snake this big snake is not the
size of the Hollywood movie anaconda is
not that not that size but as a snake
that we use juices paint because for the
hour an hour when we drink this this
medicine now recall only but some people
know as I you asked our vegetarian some
in Peru they call ayahuasca is as a mega
powerful medicine they have your vision
when we do that we saw that spear is not
a snake by speed of the snake and we use
to paint like this you can see here that
is make health we use when you use this
you are holding the energy of the snake
in your body like this I&#39;m use enough
that
we paint our face and also we paint our
body when so I paint in you yet they
