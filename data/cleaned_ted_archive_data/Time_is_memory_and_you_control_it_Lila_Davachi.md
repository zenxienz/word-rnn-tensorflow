I was in labor for 72 hours with my
first child my husband and I were
hunkered down in our small Greenwich
Village apartment in the moment I
thought it would never end but now when
I think back on those 72 hours they feel
like a blink compared to the two minutes
between hearing my daughter cry for the
first time and being able to hold her in
my arms in those two minutes I remember
the sound of her cry
I remember the doctors and nurses
commenting on her full head of dark hair
I remember my husband leaving my side to
film her first layin foot stamp and I
gel

I remember the clock on the wall 5:32
a.m. I remember seeing her face for the
first time and I said honey baby and
when she heard my voice she opened her
eye now when I think back on those two
minutes they seemed limitless now there
are many ways people have talked about
time time is money time flies like an
arrow and this is all meant to capture
some aspect of what time means in
specific contacts and today today I&#39;m
here to share with you a personal and
scientific discovery that for all of us
time is memory so before I explain this
further it&#39;s important to differentiate
between objective and subjective time
and in order to do that we&#39;re going to
do a little experiment because that&#39;s
what I do best
I&#39;m going to show you two short videos
and I simply want you to watch them and
afterwards I&#39;m going to ask you to tell
me which video is longer okay so one go
and to
okay raise your hand II Fidel the first
was longer great now raise your hand if
you thought the second was longer okay
well both videos were actually
objectively the same length
they were both five seconds but
subjective time is how long it feels
like it took to you we all varying our
perceptions of time some of you may have
thought the first took longer and some
of you may have thought the second took
longer but the important thing to glean
from this example is that time does not
exist at least not in the way that we
might think if you&#39;re looking at your
watch but instead it&#39;s an extraction
based on reality and it&#39;s related to
memory so how do we know this one we
know that if you lose your memory you
can&#39;t cobble together people with places
or things but every day is new and not
in a good way we live or you would live
in an eternal presence and this is
perhaps best exemplified by the famous
story of patient hm-hm was incredibly
debilitated by severe epilepsy and after
many years of suffering he opted to
undergo a surgery to relieve his
seizures however after the surgery HM
could no longer form any new memories he
could remember all of his years leading
up to the surgery but no matter how many
objective minutes hours days or even
years had passed after the surgery HM
had subjectively only lived a few more
moments so while this is an extreme
example it highlights that memory is our
way of reliving our past experiences and
reappear Ian Singh our time and it
follows them that the more discrete
memories you have from a prior
experience that that experience becomes
expanded in time so there&#39;s a tendency
almost complete agreement that we as
humans want more time there&#39;s never
enough time but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just
time that we want instead we long to
lead a full life now what I want to
share with you is if time is memory and
we want more time than what we really
want or more memory leading a full life
refers to the idea of having lots of
varied experiences one
that were later be memorable so so far
this might seem straightforward but it
gets a little complicated because it&#39;s
exemplified in the story of my labor and
birth how we feel time passing in the
moment is different from how we
retrospectively remember time and the
interesting finding is that our
estimates of time in the moment are
negatively related to those estimates in
memory so let me unpack that for you a
little bit let&#39;s start with the in the
moment perception we know that every day
contains the same number of minutes and
hours but our subjective perception of
each day can vary widely
some days go by quickly and others not
so quickly so in the moment what
produces is variance and how we
experience time passing well it turns
out that experiences that contain very
little change over time are the ones
that seem to drag on and take
subjectively longer than experiences
that contain a lot of change but now
consider how we reflect back and
remember time it actually works in the
opposite direction if you&#39;re asked to
remember a very mundane experience you
have little to remember and your
estimates of time shrink rapidly even
though in the moment it felt like it
would never end and by contrast when
you&#39;re asked to remember a very eventful
experience one that felt like it was
passing very quickly you would have a
lot to remember and your estimates of
that experience would actually expand so
stepping back a little what does this
tell us about how we remember our time
well we remember our time with respect
to our experiences what you&#39;re doing
with your time how much you are doing
the more places you&#39;ve been to people
you&#39;ve spoken to or even thoughts that
you&#39;ve had the longer you remember that
experience to have been so how will we
study this in the lab actually let&#39;s
make this a little bit more concrete
think of each discrete event as a unit
of experience and these units are later
available for recall think of them as
memory units
in an environment with a lot of variety
and change you&#39;re forming far more
memory units that an environment was
very little change and it&#39;s these units
the number of these units that determine
our estimates of time later on more
units more to remember and time expands
time is memory so how do we study this
in the lab in the lab we&#39;ve come up with
very simple ways to try to mimic these
ideas of contextual stability and change
in experimentally tractable ways and in
several experiments we&#39;ve studied how
people remember time participants will
come into the lab and stare and they&#39;ll
look at a computer screen and will
present a series of visual images of
objects and faces one at a time a new
one on each trial think of these as the
people and objects and your experiences
now to mimic the idea of a context
alongside each image we present a
picture of a scene and that scene will
either remain the same as in this
example across time to mimic the idea of
doing the same thing in the same way or
the scene will change now later on we
ask participants a simple question we
show them a pair of images and was
simply asking to tell us how far apart
did you experience these two images now
unbeknownst to the participants we craft
a memory test so that the pairs of
images had actually been presented
objectively the same distance apart
about 20 seconds but some of the pairs
of images were presented with the same
scene hypothetically forming one memory
unit while other pairs of images were
paired across the scene change
hypothetically forming two memory units
so even though the objective amount of
time was exactly the same what we see is
a participants reliably rate visual
images of having been encountered
farther apart in time when they had been
experienced across a scene change so
remembering two memory units compared to
one makes your memory for time expand
it&#39;s as if the changes in their
environment has a consequence of pulling
things apart in memory and time and
making the intervals between them seems
aligned
longer so to give you everyday example
imagine you go to the supermarket and
you run into your friend Surrey in Aisle
three and then some time later you run
into another good friend Raphael in
another aisle in the supermarket so take
the same example that&#39;s identical except
now you run into Raphael in the parking
lot later on you&#39;ll remember the two
encounters to be farther apart in time
if they occurred in the two different
contacts okay but the interesting thing
is what if I plop down in the moment and
met you in the parking lot and asked you
to tell me how much time had passed on
your trip to the supermarket now you get
the opposite answer the analogy here is
I would stop you in the parking lot as
you&#39;re loading groceries into your car
and simply ask you how long have you
been here in that case you would rate
the changing environment as taking a
shorter amount of time then the disable
environment so the bottom line is is
that in the moment we feel like a busy
day is passing very quickly a changing
environment feels like we&#39;re losing our
time it&#39;s going by quickly but later
when your memory is probed those same
experiences feel like they took a longer
amount of time time expands so so far
what what the examples I&#39;ve shown you
suggests that our memory for time is
actually an interpretation of the events
that are unfolding around us and our
next question was what do we rely on for
this interpretation so far all of the
examples I&#39;ve given you suggests that
changes in the external world like we&#39;ve
seen changes in my example are going to
determine how you remember time but is
it completely up to the external world
the answer is no we&#39;ve shown that how
you remember time is modulated by your
internal world your own interpretation
of the events that are unfolding so
we&#39;ve done these same kinds of tasks
using brain imaging and what we can do
is we can measure your internal world
your brain while you&#39;re viewing the same
kinds of images and specifically what we
what we do is we can take still pictures
of your brain at the beginning of a
series of images and then at the end and
we can compare the neural activity
patterns that are present at the
beginning and under these experiences
and what we see is that if your neural
activity patterns look very different
across time as in this example you
remember the associated events as having
been encountered farther important time
it&#39;s as if you&#39;re changing brain
patterns offer an interpretation that
you were in two very different contacts
in this case mental context at the
beginning and end of this series of
images on other trials even though the
same objective amount of time has passed
your brain patterns might look more
similar across time and what we see is
that when your neural activity patterns
are more similar it has the consequence
of bringing the Associated items into a
closer more integrated memory trace and
you remember those items as having been
encountered closer in time together so
the important implication here is that
even when the external environment is
changing a lot you can maintain a stable
internal experience and by contrast if
the external world isn&#39;t changing very
much you can create distinctive
experiences in your mind so in the end
this offer is an important element of
control a good example of this for me is
my morning commute I live in New York
City and I take the subway to work every
day for better or for worse and my
commute contains lots of people the
sounds of their music smells emanating
from their food and sometimes their
bodies and at every stop new folks get
on and some folks get off and some
mornings I feel like my experience is
anchored on the external environment
I notice a cute little girl and I smile
at her or I cringe that the lack of
deodorant on my neighbor
this happens a lot and you can bet if
you could look at my neural activity
patterns in that moment they&#39;d be
varying widely as I attend to all the
various elements of that experience but
on other mornings I may be trying to
figure out a problem at work and I
barely notice the stops passing by now
that&#39;s an example of maintaining a
stable internal experience so given that
we have some control over time through
memory which do we prioritize which will
you prioritize well there&#39;s no right
answer right and our priorities might
change from day to day do you prioritize
the feeling that time is passing slowly
is on a lazy Sunday or a day at the
beach or you do prioritize having lots
of memories by leading an action-packed
full life again there&#39;s no right answer
and your priorities will likely change
from day to day but I hope what I&#39;ve
shared with you today will let you know
that time is memory and with that
knowledge and hand know that you control
time thank you
