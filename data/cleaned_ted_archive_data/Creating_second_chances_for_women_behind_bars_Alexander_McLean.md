I&#39;ve had some amazing women in my life
my grandma Aileen lost her home and
family in the Second World War she
single-handedly raised my mother loved
me unconditionally and taught me to have
the courage of my convictions I grew up
in a home in London they didn&#39;t always
have electricity or gas I was too
ashamed to take the free school lunches
I was entitled to a scholarship to a
private school transformed my
aspirations susan is another amazing
woman I first met her when I was 19 and
repainting her home Susan lives in a 7
by nine foot cell shared with four other
women with no toilet or bed on death row
and lazier prison camp Paula Uganda
Susan had been sentenced to hang at the
age of 21 for killing her husband as he
attacked her with a machete Uganda has
some of the highest rates of domestic
violence in the world I realized that
women and girls are incredibly
vulnerable when they come into conflict
with the law in Africa research in
Sierra Leone revealed instances of
police torturing and raping girls as
they interrogate them in South Sudan I
met a woman who was waiting to be
executed on her husband&#39;s behalf because
the police couldn&#39;t catch him the
ugandan parliament has recently passed
legislation which mandates imprisonment
for women who wear miniskirts and
lesbians upon entering prison when he
many women lose their homes and
possessions they also lose their dignity
in prisons that don&#39;t have clinics or
sanitary towels children born in prison
may become prisoners in their own right
once they reach school age if they have
no family to take them away however
Susan showed me that African prisons can
be places of positive transformation and
that people in prison can be change
makers
I established the African prisons
project in 2006 to bring dignity and
hope to men women and children in
prisons in Africa because I believe that
every human life is incredibly precious
our work is to equip people in prison to
transform their communities and nations
as health literacy and legal educators
we&#39;re establishing a TED inspired
fellowship program for transformative
members of prison communities after
getting the death penalty Susan
completed high school exams in prison
she became a tutor to her fellow inmates
she established a prison choir and wrote
songs for it we recorded a CD of their
music in 2007 three years ago we got
Susan admitted to the University of
London to study for a degree in law by
distance learning this was the first
University in the UK to admit women and
ethnic minorities since then Susan went
to court spoke on her own behalf and got
her death sentence overturned last year
she SAT her law exams and performed well
especially in human rights law this year
she&#39;s opening a legal aid clinic in her
prison and when she&#39;s released in two
years time she plans to practice as a
lawyer we&#39;re inspired by Susan she is
gaining the tools to make her society
more just what greater transformation
then death row inmate to lawyer imagine
for the cost of keeping one person in
prison in New York for a year we can
give diplomas in law to 15 people in
African prisons to study with the
University of London the same
institution Nelson Mandela studied law
with from prison in South Africa this
year we hope to take on a whole class of
women law students in prisons in Uganda
and Kenya in doing so we believe we will
establish a new generation of lawyers
whose motivation comes from their
personal experience of con
flict with the law I hope they will
inspire vulnerable women and men all
over the world that they too may be
changemakers that&#39;s an idea worth
spreading thank you
