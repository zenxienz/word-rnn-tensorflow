oh so for those of you who are
unfamiliar with Darius&#39;s story i want
you to feel what it was like to be one
of his supporters and to meet him in
person for the first time I found some
footage on YouTube that was uploaded by
one of his fans in 2007
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
it was mania
Darius&#39;s adventure began here at a
summer camp for kids with disabilities
in our home town of Athens Georgia
Darius and his big brother Mario were
both my campers and they were also my
friends they were born with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy a fatal degenerative
disease that ultimately affects every
muscle in the body on average kids with
DMD died in their late teens or early
20s
Mario passed away the year that this
picture was taken he was just 19
in the same year Darius transition to
his first wheelchair and this was a
profound moment for Darius he&#39;d just
seen his brother died and he just become
old enough and mature enough to really
understand what the doctors meant by
these words it&#39;s 100 percent fatal and
there is no treatment so what did he do
he convinced his friends to take him on
a road trip West for three weeks in the
summer of 2005 our goals were to test
wheelchair accessibility across the
United States to raise funds and
awareness for DMD and to convince the
producers of MTV&#39;s hit show pimp my ride
to customize Darius&#39;s wheelchair on
national television footage from the
trip became a successful nonprofit
documentary and ultimately Darius would
travel over 300 thousand miles by Road
across his lifetime sharing his story
with supporters around the world he
inspired what felt like to us an entire
generation of young people to care about
his disease and in all likelihood the
kids that he reached will be the ones
who cure this disease I&#39;ll tell you how
we know that with their help Darius had
raised over 2.5 million dollars for DMD
research by the end of 2009 which was
the year that Darius and I were honored
with Ted fellowships he used the money
to fund promising DMD research all over
the world and one of the trials that he
helped fund was for a drug called exon
dys 51 7 years after coming to Ted and
seven years after helping fund that
trial on September 19 2016 X
dys 51 became the first fda-approved
treatment for DMD in history one week
one week after the scientific
breakthrough darius celebrated his 27th
birthday and two weeks after that our
friend and fellow fellow Darius Williams
passed away he left us with an
incredible perspective on his own life
and his own death and I want to leave
you with that perspective today these
are his words I&#39;ll be smiling when I
leave because when I die folks ain&#39;t
going to say Darius gone they&#39;re gonna
say Darius gone West thank you
[Applause]
