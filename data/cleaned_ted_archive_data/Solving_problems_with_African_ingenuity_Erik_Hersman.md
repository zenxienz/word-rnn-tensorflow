my name is Erik Hersman I grew up in
Kenyan Sudan actually and I now live in
the u.s. doing web application
development but the reason I&#39;m here is
because I&#39;m also a blogger I started
white African comm a couple years ago
and it talked about Africa and
Technology and then about a year ago I
started after gadget with a team of
bloggers from all over Africa and the
Diaspora that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to talk
about today
so after gadget is all about solving
everyday problems with African ingenuity
I&#39;m going to give you a speed run
through a couple slides and stories that
we&#39;ve had throughout the last year so
this is a example of some of the tools
that you&#39;ll see at roadside foodie
workshops or you know this is something
that this gentleman made from scratch to
work with small engine repair here we
have a model airplane that actually is
fully functional made from scratch
rebuilt car alternators using copper
wire bamboo and plastic a community bio
latrine project in the Kibera slum in
Kenya a 100 dollar bicycle motor that
gets 50 kilometers per hour a crocodile
made from sheet roof that has been used
and thrown away soccer ball made from
twine and old trash bags this is
actually an interesting one I just found
the other day this is a streetside
nursery and what they do there is they
divert the rainfall from the street into
a gutter and they can have water
throughout the year throughout the dry
season because of that in these pools in
the back what they also do is grow
tilapia in there to feed themselves
now you&#39;ll see toys like this all over
Africa they use wire cans wood plastic
everything you can think of but this is
just a great example of it a welding
machine handmade
and a windmill made from sheet roof
bicycle parts and actually going to talk
to you&#39;re going to hear from another
individual who&#39;s done something even
more remarkable than this one later on
today so in Africa we see ingenuity born
and born of necessity and you know these
examples are just examples of that
Africans bend the little they have to
their will every day using creativity
they overcome life&#39;s challenges and then
you know we&#39;ve already talked about what
the world sees well where the world sees
trash Africa recycles and where the
world sees junk Africa sees rebirth
thank you
