if you could stop a natural disaster and
save thousands or millions of lives
would you right now we are in a position
to prevent a natural disaster I&#39;m
talking about asteroids about twice a
year a sizable asteroid impacts earth
and puts us at risk most of the time
these exploded too high in altitude to
cause any damage to the ground but as
you can see asteroid impacts are not
rare just two years ago we had a wake-up
call an asteroid exploded near the city
of Chelyabinsk Russia population over a
million that asteroid was 18 metres long
the size of a school bus it blew out a
hundred thousand windows and over 1,500
people were injured shockingly we had no
advance warning world space agencies and
governments first learned about that
asteroid on Twitter there was a far more
devastating asteroid that impacted near
remote tunguska siberia in 1908 that
asteroid flattened trees for 830 square
miles the size of the Los Angeles basin
it had the energy of 300 Hiroshima bombs
so just imagine if in 1908 that asteroid
had impacted earth a couple of minutes
earlier or a couple of minutes later
over a populated region that asteroid
impact would have been the defining
event of the 20th century so our
challenge is detecting dangerous
asteroids we estimate there are nearly 1
million potentially dangerous asteroids
in our inner solar system because of
that in 2005 Congress required NASA to
find these dangerous asteroids and so
far over 12,000 have been found 12,000
that leaves us 980 7840 it leaves us a
lot more potentially dangerous asteroids
to find so are so
Lucien we need to build telescopes on
land and in space to find these
dangerous asteroids it will take focus
it will take funding to build these
telescopes and accelerate discovery once
we find the dangerous asteroids we know
what to do we&#39;re not going to blow them
up like you see in the movies instead
we&#39;re going to deflect them will launch
some spacecraft that will push or pull
the asteroids into a different orbit so
that they&#39;re no longer on a path to
impact earth within enough advanced
warning we know how to deflect asteroids
but our challenge continues to be
detection we can&#39;t stop what we can&#39;t
see we can and should and should dare to
defend our planet asteroid impacts or
one natural disaster we know how to
prevent thank
