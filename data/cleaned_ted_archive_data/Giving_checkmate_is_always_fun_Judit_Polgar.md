before I was born my parents decided
that I was going to be genies chess is a
game that you can learn the basic rules
in about 15 minutes but it has more
combinations than atoms in the universe
just was and still is after today in
male-dominated sport was it realistic
from my parents to think that I can
become the ultimate world chess champion
both of my parents are teachers we lived
in Hungary modest conditions behind the
Iron Curtain
by the beginning of the 80s I started to
get interested about the game by this
time both of my sisters were playing
competitive chess my mother told me the
first moves when I was about five years
old and we lived in a small apartment
there my sister Susan had already
serious chess trainings in the living
room behind closed doors I very much
wanted to go in to that room but it was
forbidden for me as my parents told me
you can enter once you learn how to play
chess so obviously I was very motivated
to learn the game in the beginning it
was only a game for me but it became
gradually competitive it suited very
much to my character as from a very
early age I love challenges by
practicing daily chess chess became as
my native language I never forget when I
was just seven years old and I was
standing in a main square of a town in
Hungary and there were 15 chess board
set up and I was playing with 15
opponents simultaneously and I&#39;ll beat
them all
but what was even more fun when a bit
later I was playing and winning against
grown-up man playing blindfolded which
means in chess that I was with my back
to the chess board and Colin got the
moves like Quinn GA check my opponent
would see the board and while making the
move would give the answer rook takes GA
and I would go knight of seven checkmate
of course at this point I was giggling
the gif checkmate is always fun
especially to adults let me take you
back in time to Greece when I was only
12 years old in 1988 it was a milestone
in my career as I was for the first time
part of the women&#39;s Olympic national
team but what was really great that I
was playing together with my sisters in
one team side by side a journalist years
later told me that when the reporters
saw the list the Hungarian teenage team
they considered it&#39;s going to be a
nice-sized story of the event but it
turned out that I was winning one game
after the other and our team was winning
day by day and we became the story of
the event as the coolest thing was that
we broke down the 30 years of Soviet
hegemony by winning the Olympic gold
medal for the first time
but I can recall a very special moment
for me which I keep in my memory when I
was playing in this Olympia the game tan
I was concentrated very much on the
board and after calculating some lines
I looked up from the chess board and who
did I see the world champion Garry
Kasparov watching my game Wow
the player who I admired and I respected
so much and I learned so much from his
games
it gave me inspiration and gave me
energy too
I smashed my opponent in that game
within a few moves after the Olympia a
journalist asked us Perot what does he
think about my chess do you think that
it&#39;s possible that one day Judith will
challenge you he would say I&#39;m
absolutely sure that she&#39;s going to
become the woman&#39;s vote chess champion
but if we will play and then he
continued that I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s
almost impossible almost as a matter of
fact it was he was not the only world
champion thinking similarly about
women&#39;s chess as a matter of fact the
legendary Bobby Fischer once said I can
give a night or two any woman player in
the world and I can still beat her but
to give you perspective what is to give
a night or in chess it&#39;s like entering
in a swimming competition having your
hands behind tidier tied your hands
behind your back before jumping into the
pool so you can imagine how happy I was
at the age of 15 when I broke Bobby
Fischer&#39;s record becoming the youngest
Grandmaster
by this time I was the number one woman
player in the world but my real dream
was to become the ultimate number one
between man and women I knew I have a
very long road ahead of me then for the
first time I met Kasparov it was an
exceptional experience for me
he has such a charisma strong presence
and incredible deep chess preparation
practically I&#39;ve lost the game before
even making a single move you may ask
how is that possible right it&#39;s because
I had great respect for his chess and
psychology is very big part of the game
imagine Kasparov walks into the playing
hole and sits down opposite to you I had
the feeling that he wants to eat me up
alive it took me years until I figured
out a strategy that works against him I
gave him a hard time in this game first
of all I build up my self-confidence and
I used his own weapon against him when I
was playing this game my focus was that
I will attack his King aggressively no
matter what happens on the chess board I
will stick to my plan at one point he
started to feel uncomfortable and he
took off his jacket put it on the chair
took off his watch put it next to the
chess board and from his body language
it was obvious that he didn&#39;t feel good
at all I even had the feeling for a
fraction of a second that he had it in
mind that maybe he might even lose the
game but he escaped this time but I felt
that victory was within reach our next
encounter was a bit more than a year
when we met again over the chess board
and it was very interesting that
Kasparov also had this very aggressive
style and he wanted to kill the opponent
but in this game he choose the very
modest opening which was very calm they
exchanged the Queens already at the very
beginning of the game to enter into
calmer positions but in the middle of
the game when we entered into the
crucial situation when he captured one
of my pieces instead of capturing it
back the natural way I was playing with
my rook the unexpected moved to the
middle of the board and I was attacking
his King again it turned out to be a
decisive move and within the moves
Kasparov had a difficult position he
couldn&#39;t start my threat of giving a
checkmate and he resigned this game gave
me a lot of energy and strength to fight
in my upcoming tournaments event
competitions and I fought myself into
the top 10 practice perseverance and
passion these are key elements of my
success but you may ask whether did I
achieved accomplished my dream to become
the world number one in ultimate
competition and I have to say no I did
not
but I did challenge all the top
grandmasters I planed it in the world
championship tournaments and I did beat
11 respective world champions
after those championships tournaments
challenges fights victories I have a new
dream my dream is to see educational
chess in all elementary schools because
I strongly believe the chess is not only
a game sport and part of culture but it
is an essential educational tool I was
very fortunate when I was very little to
learn the game of chess it gave me a lot
it gave me a lot of success happiness
over the chess board but it gave me much
more it gave me life skills which I use
in everyday life whatever I do in our
multitasking world I think creativity
logical thinking problem-solving and
good decision-making are essential
skills but until my new dream becomes
reality I like to inspire people
especially youngsters to dream big make
good moves in life set your goals high
and rigidly impossible thank you
Thank You Julie question you said that
you had to develop your own aggressive
style to be successful in a
male-dominated sport like like chest
tell us more about that style how is it
well it means on the chess board that I
always always going for the king okay
and I wanted to win the game as soon as
possible I was creating opportunities
from nothing like from a sunny day the
sunder comes and and that&#39;s the image I
had from a very early age like 11 would
you be willing to share with us one of
your games
sure do we have a board here so what
game are you going to show us who are
you playing against I play the game
against Karpov this time he&#39;s like I&#39;m
Anatoly Karpov now well if you want to
be yes I have of this is chess as a
second language she&#39;s speaking chess now
this was the position okay hold on all
right so I I&#39;m counting I have one more
pound than you
does that mean that I&#39;m ahead well in
chess but first of all many of my games
were like this that I was giving up my
pieces in order to attack the king and
we usually say that I have compensation
like the black piece is very much out of
the board on the side and I have two
bishops which are can be very strong so
more or less the game is balanced but it
can be dangerous for black okay is it
your turn now I played a very small move
with my rook okay that&#39;s interesting I
see that you&#39;re indirectly defending
this found that I could take my with my
queen so maybe you are threatening me to
take this found exactly this is so
Karpov had in mind I didn&#39;t cut off okay
so so I&#39;m I&#39;m going to defend it like
this and the interesting thing is that
already Karpov was in town pressure and
he didn&#39;t realize that he&#39;s going to get
mate it very soon this time it&#39;s you oh
I was sacrificing my bishop yeah it&#39;s
not defended I&#39;ll take it
I would give a check oh okay
I cannot go here cannot hear only one
that this is the only one I have right
yeah okay and now I was sacrificing my
next bishop in order to open up the King
okay you know considerable here that I
have no other option than to take your
bishop
okay actually Karpov resigned already be
playing I&#39;m the new car for sure
okay I again I have just one move right
well you have a move to go with your
king yes this is the only one I can play
and I would go checkmate within g5
congratulations Thank You JD folder
thank you
