I want to ask you to spend the next few
minutes thinking about truck drivers
that&#39;s probably not a group of people
you spend a lot of time thinking about
in your day to day life but I think you
should and the reason is because
truckers do largely invisible work we&#39;re
totally dependent on the work they do
and we hardly ever think about it and
truckers actually have some really
surprising things to teach us about
surveillance and monitoring so there are
about 3 million 3 and a half million
truck drivers in the u.s. they&#39;re hidden
human infrastructure right we hardly
ever appreciate the work they&#39;re doing
but truckers have a saying which is if
you got it a truck brought it and if you
think about it even in the digital age
basically every material thing you owned
was at some point on a truck being
driven by a truck driver
they really literally touch our lives in
lots of different ways and when I talk
to truck drivers about oh I didn&#39;t I
should say to when we do think about
truck drivers it&#39;s largely not in a
positive sense right sometimes we think
about them when we&#39;re trying to pass
them on the highway and that&#39;s not
usually a very positive experience and
then pop culture tends to portray the
driver as a misfit or an outlaw and not
someone who&#39;s doing a difficult job
working really hard now I&#39;ve spent a lot
of the last couple years talking to
drivers about their work and when I
asked them what attracted them to truck
driving a lot of what they tell me is
kind of this romance of the open road or
the idea of autonomy the idea that no
one is looking over your shoulder no one
is monitoring you right you you do work
in the way that you see fit now as we
all know the open road isn&#39;t actually
all that open when you really look at it
there are lots of rules on the road and
truckers deal with rules and spades much
more so than most of us do and the rule
I want to talk with you about today has
to do with the hours that truckers drive
now the federal government restricts the
hours truckers can drive which is a
safety regulation right the idea is the
more drivers are on the road the more
tired they&#39;re gonna be the more tired
they are the more likely they are to
cause expensive and deadly accidents so
the government caps the number of hours
they can drive every day now for about
the past 80 years truckers have been
required to keep track of their hours
using paper logbooks which look like
this you can buy a book of these
at any truck stop for just a few dollars
and it&#39;s a pretty simple technology the
driver just takes a pencil draws a line
on this graph indicating when he&#39;s
driving when he&#39;s off duty when he&#39;s
doing something like fueling or
unloading and then he has to be ready to
present this piece of paper to law
enforcement if he&#39;s pulled over or at a
weigh station now the problem with this
system is that drivers don&#39;t take these
seriously at all they often call their
logs their comic books or their coloring
books or their swindle sheets and it&#39;s
well known that drivers pretty rampantly
fudged their logs right and that makes
sense there are a lot of contingencies
on the road sometimes trips just take
longer than you think they&#39;re going to
and drivers are financially incentivized
to stay on the road as much as possible
so they have another saying drivers have
a lot of things and this one is if the
wheel ain&#39;t turning you ain&#39;t earn it
right there&#39;s they&#39;re not getting paid
to sit by the side of the road waiting
for the next available legal driving
time so if you think that this is a
problem if you really think we should be
getting tired truckers off the road one
potential solution is to monitor drivers
electronically and that&#39;s the approach
that the Department of Transportation is
taking so they&#39;re in the process of
rolling out a mandate that will require
all drivers to by install and use what
are called electronic onboard recorders
or EOB ours which look like this and
basically the EOB are just automates the
function of the paper log it plugs into
the truck itself and it monitors when
the truck is in motion to construct the
same kind of log right now as you can
imagine not every trucker is a huge fan
of the EOBR some of them are actually
some of the drivers I&#39;ve talked to have
said you know this kind of levels the
playing field a bit keeps me from having
to compete with someone who&#39;s willing to
break all the rules all the time but by
and large most drivers feel that these
are you know black boxes or spy boxes is
a common descriptor for them that
they&#39;re invading their privacy that
they&#39;re impugning their dignity and that
the boxes treat them like children or
criminals so as you can imagine there&#39;s
quite a bit of controversy in the
industry right now about these now one
of the reasons for this has to do with
the capabilities of the box itself so
what the government is likely to require
is basically just a piece of just a box
that monitors when the truck is in
motion
where it is not actually all that much
data but what&#39;s key here is the auxilary
features that are bundled with that
technology right and it&#39;s those auxilary
features that truckers employers are
very interested in because they&#39;re also
very interested in monitoring their
employees right so in a way it&#39;s as if
the government said okay everybody has
to buy a cell phone that makes calls
right but you guys all know you can&#39;t
really just buy a cell phone that makes
calls basically all the cell phones on
the market make calls and then some and
so what is the and then some for EOBR as
well in addition to monitoring when the
truck is driving they&#39;ll also monitor
things like when the driver breaks hard
how fast he&#39;s going at any given moment
if he changes lanes without signaling
what his fuel efficiency is if he leaves
a pre-specified route right it&#39;ll send
all of that information back in real
time to the drivers employer and it&#39;ll
allow the employer to construct a
scorecard which can then be used to rank
the driver alongside his co-workers
sometimes companies will attach a small
financial incentive to good performance
or they&#39;ll just even so simply post the
scores up in a common area so drivers
can feel can get a sense for where they
are as compared to their co-workers so
this this technology then seems to form
what I call a surveillant convergence so
in other words the single piece of
technology both is surveillant
technology for for law enforcement right
it&#39;s there&#39;s a government purpose but it
also serves employers purposes right it
allows truckers to be monitored Cutts
kind of coming from two different places
and a single technology that&#39;s all
bundled together and so I think a
technology like this tells us something
about surveillance more generally in
society so often when we think about
surveillance we tend to think about kind
of the big name things right things like
the NSA&#39;s prism program what we don&#39;t
think about are these sort of more
subtle insidious technologies that
infiltrate all different aspects of our
daily lives how we live work and relate
to one another and I think the trucker&#39;s
scenario is really instructive in
helping us to think through how those
technologies are impacting us even when
even for really autonomous mobile
employees who traditionally
have a lot of freedom like chart drivers
