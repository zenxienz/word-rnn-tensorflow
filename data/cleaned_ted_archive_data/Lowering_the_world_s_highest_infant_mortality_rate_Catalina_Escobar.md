okay
this is one Philippe
my second son he was 16 months old when
he fell from an eighth floor in
Cartagena Colombia my country 13 years
ago this little baby I didn&#39;t give birth
to this one though but this little one
also passed away in a public hospital I
was volunteering for a full year and
they both passed within four days the
difference was that my own son was an
accident
this little one passed because his teen
mom failed to raise $30 to pay for his
treatment and I had that money in my
pocket that day but that money was
needed a few days before so I lived in
Cartagena for two and a half years 1998
with my husband and my two baby boys
Encarta hen I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve been
there but Cartagena is this beautiful
city located at the northern Caribbean
part of Colombia but when you go there
it&#39;s totally surrounded by misery this
parent that&#39;s why I started volunteering
in this public hospital maternity
hospital and a couple of days a week for
a full year in that neonatal unit if I
could call that a unit because there
were only babies and cradles a couple of
baby sick babies and I would spend hours
there and I remember coming or not
Tuesday and I would turn around and say
what happened to the baby over here and
the nurses came to me and said that baby
died and what about the one over there
or is that old that one too
so it was sort of a normal thing and you
know these things I was you know opening
this door where it was too big of a
problem to deal with
so I said god that&#39;s it
I&#39;m not standing still they&#39;re babies
dying out there and I fell nobody was
doing anything so as a business woman
out I was back then working with an
American company partnering with them
actually I said well in order to do this
I need to figure out I need to think
about a strategic thinking and model
that would affect the highest impact
possible the highest number of people so
this is where I started said well but
you know it&#39;s gonna take a full life
commitment so the first year I started
studying the numbers like any business
person and this is what I found
Kartha Haena used to have the highest
infant mortality rate in the whole
country
forty-eight deaths per 1,000 born alive
while in the US were 6.8 it was the year
2000 right and I turned around and said
where aren&#39;t these babies dying and was
the hospital I was volunteering actually
there were 65 deaths per 1000 750 babies
used to die a year most of them
preventable causes god and I said this
is too big for me this is such a big
problem and then I said well I should
start from the very beginning
let&#39;s Taric at the hospital and then I
asked myself where is this hospital in
the hemisphere where I can find the
lowest infant mortality rate and it was
in California ha
and I went there and I found out that
there were four key aspects the first
medical protocols high-tech equipment
hide standard medical staff and a system
who&#39;ll pay for the bills okay so I
brought that to Columbia I sort of
Colombian Isaac and I faced another
challenge the fundraising nobody would
give me money people thought I was crazy
that hasn&#39;t changed much though but we
built we raised the money and we built a
state-of-the-art intensive care unit for
babies we equipped it we operated it for
a few years and then we said God we need
to measure ourselves we brought some
experts and after six seven years of
operations this is what we got we
lowered the total infant mortality rate
by 79%
God we have saved more than 3,200 babies
and it didn&#39;t cost more than $600,000
you believe that oh I was so happy and
then I said I&#39;m not happy enough because
where are these children coming from
we&#39;re saving those babies lives but
they&#39;re trapped in poverty and they&#39;re
trapped because their mothers are
trapped and then I turned around and
said let&#39;s study the facts Columbia
listen one third of our population still
under the poverty line 19 percent of
women who give birth are teenagers then
shift car tahina
68 percent of the population 1 million
people are they&#39;re still under the
poverty line 30 percent of women who
give birth are teenagers you know what
happens over there you really want to
know what happens
well these girls they&#39;re in extreme
poverty conditions they&#39;re completely
trapped in poverty they&#39;re sexually
abused and that really concerns me but
once again I said god I need to make
another model who you know to break that
poverty cycle but make it in a
sustainable replaceable way and create
the highest social impact possible once
again a strategic driven mind so that&#39;s
why I find these communities a lot of
problems but we also found that word
really perpetuates poverty in our
nation&#39;s in Latin America is teen
pregnancy there&#39;s a close correlation
between
poverty and teen pregnancy in Colombia
today is number one in South America and
we started with his girls teens and you
find faces like this one like works Ana
she was sexually abused raped by her
sister ex-boyfriend when she was 15
she&#39;s now in the middle of a program and
you final these things are but you also
find that girls over there didn&#39;t just
get pregnant and they could pregnant
because there&#39;s repeating the same
paradigms other mothers and grandmothers
who were teen moms as well
all they see and all they learn is what
they have in their communities in the
fish tank
oh dear so we had this problem back
again and said we need to figure out in
a very short term how to break that
cycle of poverty so this is what we call
the 360-degrees intervention so we bring
those girls between two to four years
and we don&#39;t have a shelter they come
like if they go to school on a daily
basis the first six months are the most
important ones
these girls are either pregnant or just
deliver their babies we provide them
with education health care nutrition the
basics but that&#39;s the easy part we give
them whole world of empowerment dignity
dignity is not you don&#39;t input poor
things to the poor they&#39;re tired of
being poor you have to give them the
very best and the second phase a lot of
education they need to graduate from
high school and we have scholarship for
college and careers technical careers
and then along the way we teach them how
to work if they start earning a little
bit of money I haven&#39;t seen such a
powerful thing as a woman earning money
they become independent it&#39;s amazing and
we have what we call their productive
workshops if you go there ever there are
quite a few people here they&#39;ve been in
cut line into our foundation but if you
really go there this productive work
shows workshops enable these girls to
acquire the expertise the industry needs
so it&#39;s a demand and supply kind of
thing where we match so this is what I
really love the two key drivers how we
measure ourselves like usual earning
stable income and having a responsible
sex life because we know that if they
get pregnant in the short term back to
poverty what we really do the bottom
line is that we take them out of that
fish tank and provide them with this
whole world of opportunities in fact out
there they&#39;re not victims anymore see
they&#39;re now taking part of an active and
progressive society we have worked with
twenty 2710 moms since the year 2000 480
sorry 95% of them have a responsible sex
life that&#39;s so very important and 72% of
them either study or work I want to see
that facing every single girl of mine
and you know the bottom line we cannot
get confused between change and
transformation that leads into progress
you know
because usually people change
circumstances but with love compassion
structure and passion we&#39;re not changing
circumstances we&#39;re changing their
realities you know and after all these
years
what started as a painful and sad story
it&#39;s a love story of laughing we were
together we&#39;re a team
he cannot transform without his mom and
I certainly cannot do it either by
myself and that&#39;s why I find is the real
power of love it&#39;s that connection
between both to change that reality this
one thank you
