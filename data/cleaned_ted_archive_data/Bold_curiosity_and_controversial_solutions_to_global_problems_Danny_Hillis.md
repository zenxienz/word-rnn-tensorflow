well thank you Chris so what if there
was a way to build a thermostat that
allowed you to turn down the temperature
of the earth anytime you want it now you
would think if somebody had a plausible
idea about how to do that everybody
would be very excited about it would be
lots of research on how to do it but in
fact a lot of people do understand how
to do that but there&#39;s not much support
for research in this area and I think
part of it is because there&#39;s some real
misunderstandings about it so I&#39;m not
going to try to convince you today that
this is a good idea but I am going to
try to get your curiosity going about it
and throw up some of the
misunderstandings so the basic idea of
solar geoengineering is that we can cool
things down just by reflecting a little
bit more sunlight back into space and
ideas about how to do this have been
around literally for decades so clouds
as you just heard or a great way to do
that these low-lying clouds everybody
knows is cooler under cloud unlike this
cloud because it has exactly the same
water content is to transfer air around
it and it just shows that even a little
bit of a change in the flow of the air
can cause a cloud to form so we make
artificial clouds all the time these are
contrails which are artificial water
clouds that are made by the passing of a
jet engine and so we&#39;re already changing
the clouds in our earth by AXA or if you
like to believe it by super-secret
government conspiracy but where we are
already doing this quite a lot this is a
NASA picture of shipping lines as a
passing ship actually cause clouds to
form and this is a big enough of fact
that it actually helps reduce global
warming already by about a degree so we
already are doing solar engine
there&#39;s lots of ideas about how to do
this people have looked at everything
from building giant parasols on the
space to choosing bubble waters in the
ocean and some of these are actually
very plausible ideas one that was
published recently by David Heath at
Harvard is to take chalk and and put
dust up into stratosphere where reflects
off sunlight and that&#39;s a really neat
idea because chalk is one of the most
common minerals on earth and it&#39;s very
safe it&#39;s so safe we put it into baby
food and basically if you throw a chalk
up into the stratosphere it comes down
in a couple of years all by itself
dissolved in rainwater now before you
start worrying about all this chalk in
your rain water let me explain to you a
little little of it it actually takes
and that turns out to be very easy to
calculate this is a back-of-the-envelope
calculation I made but I assure you
people have done much more account
careful calculations and it comes out
with the same answer which is that you
have to put chalk up at a rate of about
ten teragrams a year to undo the effects
of the co2 that we&#39;ve already done just
in terms of temperature not all the
effects but the temperature so well you
know what what does that look like I
can&#39;t visualize 10 0 grams per year so I
asked the Cambridge fire department and
Taylor mill fall to lend me a hand and
this is a hose pumping water at 10
teragrams a year and that is how much
you would have to pump into the
stratosphere to cool the earth back down
to pre-industrial levels it&#39;s amazingly
little it&#39;s like one hose for the entire
earth now of course you wouldn&#39;t really
use a hose should fly it up in airplanes
or something like that
but it&#39;s so little it would be like
putting a him a handful of chalk and
every Olympic
full of rain it&#39;s almost laughing so why
don&#39;t people like this idea why is it
more seriously and there&#39;s some very
good reasons for that um a lot of people
really don&#39;t think we should be talking
about this at all and in fact I have
some very good friends in the audience
who I respect a lot who really don&#39;t
think I should be talking about this and
the reason is that they&#39;re concerned but
if people imagine that there&#39;s some easy
way out that we won&#39;t give up our
addiction to fossil fuels and I do worry
about that I think it&#39;s actually a
serious problem but there&#39;s also I think
a deeper problem which is nobody likes
the idea of messing with the entire
Earth isolados I love this planet I
really do and I don&#39;t want to mess with
it but we&#39;re already changing our
atmosphere we&#39;re already messing with it
and so I think it it makes sense for us
to look for ways to have so mitigate
that in impact and that we need to do
research to do that we need to
understand the science behind that I
noticed that there&#39;s a theme that&#39;s kind
of developed it tab which is kind of
fear versus hope or creativity versus
caution and of course we need both of us
so there aren&#39;t any silver bullets you
know this is certainly not a silver
bullet but we need science to tell us
what our options are and that informs
both our creativity and our caution so I
am an optimist about our future selves
but are not an optimist because I think
our problems are small I&#39;m an optimist
because I think our capacity to deal
with our problems is much greater than
we imagined thank you very much
so we we do have a real life expert on
clouds with us do you mind if I invite
up on stage Katie do you mind if I
invite you back on today about as much
as we can have a conversation about this
well I know Nancy disagrees with me
about so said okay what did you make of
Danny&#39;s talk Jenny you&#39;ve seemed so nice
and I hope we can be friends and you you
terrify me I am very worried about you
engineering solutions for many different
reasons I feel like if I went to the
doctor and the doctor said you have a
fever I know exactly why you have a
fever we&#39;re not going to treat that
we&#39;re just going to give you ibuprofen
and also your nose is going to fall off
I would be really upset and I would want
a new doctor and I feel like dealing
with climate change by reducing the
amount of sunlight we get is really
problematic because there are physical
reasons to be frightened by that for
example it&#39;s not going to do anything
about ocean acidification and that&#39;s I
care very much about the health of the
oceans but I think I&#39;m a physicist but
I&#39;m also a human being of a citizen and
I&#39;m frightened as a citizen because I
feel like when I want to do an
experiment I have to go to my University
and if there are human subjects I have
to obtain informed consent from every
single human subject and I feel like
what what you are proposing to do is
involving all of us as your human
subjects and I&#39;m not sure I consent to
that
I sympathize with all of that and I
think it would be great if we lived in
the world where people had to get their
consent before messing with it but you
are already in the middle of an
experiment and I&#39;m not talking about
that one either right I&#39;m not either
people are already messing with the
atmosphere and we don&#39;t really
understand the effects of it so we are
geoengineering and so what I&#39;m arguing
for is we should understand it we should
do the research to understand it I&#39;m not
claiming insecure but it may be it may
be something that we need to help us
cool down while we fix the ball and I
don&#39;t think you know we can throw away
any options now I think we really need
to get the knowledge if we&#39;re going to
do geoengineering which we are going to
do even if it&#39;s a bad idea we need to
understand that and we need to do a
better job of it okay so this is the
start of an incredibly important
conversation thank you both of you we&#39;re
going to continue this we can still be
friends thank you
