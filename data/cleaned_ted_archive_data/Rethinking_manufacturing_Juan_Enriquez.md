all right so the really good news is
I&#39;ve got some really cool stuff on
evolution bad news is it&#39;s not big debt
you won&#39;t see it till January so in the
meantime I&#39;m gonna try and knit together
three big themes that have been going on
at Ted and then do something really
stupid which is actually say what part
of this might mean for the next 30 years
so as you nip these things that don&#39;t go
together together I&#39;m gonna bring the
other networks robots in 3d printing and
you&#39;ve been hearing about that this Ted
this morning this session last year and
as you&#39;re thinking about the impact of
these things the first thing you&#39;ve got
to talk about is how it affects people
because there&#39;s a management bromide out
there that people are the most important
part of any organization and you start
every HR meeting with us and you talk
about it but how you organize people has
really changed so if you think about the
guild system back in the 1500s how you
organize people was in these little tiny
cells in these concrete units you did
not want to spread information you
wanted to keep it tight you wanted to
keep it really secret it didn&#39;t want
people to know how you made those
textiles as you begin to move technology
forward then you organize people in
these long lines and they become
interchangeable and instead of people
really mattering it&#39;s engineering
logistics time and you get a 50 fold
increase in output so that different way
of organizing people moving from these
little cells into very long things
actually really works then in the 1960s
you have a corporate structure that
begins to reflect that so it really
doesn&#39;t matter who organizes or who sits
in those boxes you can move people from
this geography to that geography this
function of that function the lead books
are talking about the organization man
primarily because it was all men wearing
wingtips with one woman and white shirts
and blue suits and as you go forward in
that you have a whole series of workers
who actually hate it when something goes
wrong now you&#39;re organizing people in a
different way and in a knowledge economy
you actually love it when things go
wrong because then you can build and
change and make things and networks and
you begin to organize people
based on how are you and where are you
in this network unless as the Christakis
fowler stuff you&#39;ve seen over the last
few years so there are key bridges there
are people who are highly influential
there are clusters of people and you can
map every doctor in Raleigh Durham North
Carolina on how they interact and you
can do the same thing for undergraduates
and you&#39;ve seen this chart so it&#39;s who
gets the flu how quickly is it
contagious
and the same thing is true for products
and services but that is a completely
different way of organizing people and
if people matter they matter in a very
different way today from the corporate
1960s so where it gets interesting is
when you begin to plug in these
technologies so all of a sudden what
you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re taking this
non-hierarchical
networked economy and you&#39;re beginning
to plug in these 3d printers that we&#39;ve
been hearing about that can make very
sophisticated objects and you&#39;re
beginning to get these Maker Cafe is and
people are beginning to really be able
to print and paper or to print and water
to print in plastic or to print in metal
so you have a very different networking
structure very different hierarchical
structure with the new technology coming
in and then you add the third thing
which is robots so the stuff that rod
Brooks is doing is incredibly important
because it&#39;s the first uncaged
industrial robot which means you can get
between the car and the robot and it
won&#39;t take your head off
second thing is he&#39;s shipping it for
twenty-two thousand bucks the third
thing is it doesn&#39;t take a PhD a
programmer so in my own strange mind you
take these networked economies and you
begin to put them together and all of a
sudden your core R&amp;D starts
decentralizing out of these
organizations so you can have innovation
and new designs way at the edges of this
thing you can have an entirely different
manufacturing base and oh by the way
your customers become designers as well
which is why you now have a cupholder in
Tesla and the file is uploaded and you
download it and what that means in very
practical terms is that this kid can
show up in your office and say I&#39;d like
to build a flying car
and you kind of say alright take a
number right sure you&#39;re gonna build a
flying car I mean it took General Motors
next time the next years to do this
thing but of course
comes back four years later proves you
wrong and builds a car which of course
you can order today and for everybody
with purple tags it&#39;s much cooler to
drive up to the hotel lobby and one of
these than a Tesla so as you&#39;re thinking
about the stuff and the implications of
these things here are five major changes
that I think are going to take place
because we&#39;re organizing society in a
different way because we&#39;re bringing
robots into it and because we&#39;re able to
print in three dimensions so change
number one network forces are going to
begin to overwhelm corporations you keep
your corporation organized in that
structured hierarchical way you&#39;re toast
because the network is just going to
each a second big change 3d printing and
robots are going to decentralize
manufacturing design that core R&amp;D
department that would design something
for five years and then send it off to
corporate and go through all those
things and let it go to the fair and
then it would be on the shelf and three
or five years that&#39;s going to be
completely overwhelmed by customers if
the company doesn&#39;t do it itself you&#39;re
going to get a very fast build and
redesign the cost of making things is
going to drop radically so if you can
plug these three technologies together
it really doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re
making a big pen or a Montblanc pen and
that&#39;s part of what makes this design
stuff so interesting because the
manufacturing is fundamentally going to
change and then the last thing is the US
and the you might become low-cost
manufacturing centers because all of a
sudden how you make stuff where you make
stuff may not be a monkey Lola in Mexico
it may not be China may not be India and
what&#39;s really interesting about the
stuff is there&#39;s these three or four or
five really big underlying themes kind
of wandering their way through Ted as
you begin to knit those things together
you&#39;re going to see some very very large
scale changes in how we organize society
and who&#39;s rich and who is poor and how
things actually happen thank you very
much
