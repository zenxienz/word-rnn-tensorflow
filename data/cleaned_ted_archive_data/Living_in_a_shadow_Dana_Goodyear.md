starting early in the morning of the day
i went to see barry mcgee and claire
rojas married artists whose story I&#39;ve
been wanting to tell since I first heard
it 13 years ago a robin redbreast
started hurling itself at the glass
window in their living room it wouldn&#39;t
stop Claire said it knew you were coming
she cuts three paper birds out of she
cut out three paper birds and pasted
them to the window to warn the bird away
thud it Dov&#39;s suicidally again causing
her three dogs to bark wildly Claire
said maybe it&#39;s Margaret in 1999 when
Claire was in her early 20s and had
recently graduated from the Rhode Island
School of Design she started sending
cassette tapes of her music to Barry and
his wife Margaret Killgallon was also an
artist margaret was beautiful a wisp of
a woman with wavy auburn hair and vivid
blue eyes self-effacing but stubborn an
idealist and an amp she played the banjo
and surfed and the women she depicted
smoking fighting huge painted freehand
on gallery walls did the same Margaret
and Barry were twins kindred each
other&#39;s first love they ate the same
dress the same painted side-by-side
often on scraps of wood they dragged in
from the street using discarded house
paint that they got for free together
they went up and down the west coast
sneaking into train yards and repeating
their aliases on boxcars murga dan Barry
stood at the center of a group of San
Francisco artists called the mission
school they&#39;re outside our aesthetic was
its roots in graffiti and mural art and
old-timey sign painting was starting to
dominate and shape the contemporary art
scene they had shows in London and New
York and
in LA and Tokyo very represented the
united states of the venice biennale
margaret was later in the Whitney
Biennial like many young female painters
of her generation Claire looked up to
Margaret before long though this
aesthetic crush so common in benign
among artists turned into something else
entirely leading some to say that what
Claire wanted was not to be like
Margaret but to be her to the extent
that this is true i think that Margaret
may have wanted it needed it to the
music Clara spent Darien Margaret was
naive and stripped down just a guitar
and a voice they listen to it
obsessively they started a
correspondence with Claire little
thank-you notes and encouragement the
better music and about our own paintings
which were miniature intricate fairytale
scenes Claire sent more tapes when
Margaret got pregnant she filled the
pages of her sketchbook with possible
baby names Piper Mojave Bianca Claire so
like Rojas CLA re seven months pregnant
Margaret went to Philadelphia for a
group show West Coast artists and their
East Coast counterparts Claire was one
of the East Coast artists and so the pen
pals met properly at last Claire
remembers Margaret up at a gigantic
ladder or willowy woman with a huge
belly painting with roller brushes on to
the walls late into the night one night
in Philadelphia Claire saw Margaret run
into the bathroom and followed her her
unflappable new friend was sobbing
terrified something was horribly wrong
with Margaret&#39;s body that much was clear
queue outside Margaret&#39;s closed circle
knew it but she was a cancer survivor
and shortly after marrying Barry had
undergone a mastectomy
after the surgery she chose not to have
chemotherapy or radiation her doctor
thought she would be fine but throughout
her pregnancy she had premonitions pains
that her Midwife explained away in her
sketchbook Margaret made lists of
carcinogens and ominous assemblages of
words far away underneath dead weight
dead weight spells waait in her private
thoughts it was only a matter of time
along with her baby a tumor was growing
inside Margaret and on some level at
seems she knew it after Philadelphia she
learned that the cancer was in her liver
were added Lane undetectable behind the
baby hidden her mother who had also had
breast cancer told me that she urged
Margaret to get treatment immediately
but again she refused she wanted to see
the pregnancy through without adding any
other variables in june 2001 a month
before her due date she gave birth to a
baby girl and then started an aggressive
treatment regimen she named the baby
asha hope in sanskrit three weeks later
Margaret died not long before that
Claire received an email from the
curator of the Philadelphia show letting
her know that Margaret wanted her to
call Claire put it off too shy then the
curator called to tell her that Margaret
was gone so you don&#39;t know what she
wanted to say to you I asked no idea
Claire said fairy who had been sitting
there saying almost nothing just quietly
shaping a little twist tie into a heart
suddenly looked up and said it wasn&#39;t to
come meet me Claire said this was an
arranged marriage by Margaret I swear to
God
the terrible economy of Margaret&#39;s
deaths one person leaving is another
entered David a mythic quality the baby
who sells had multiplied along with the
cancer was a little miracle and Margaret
as the mother who had given up her life
so that her child could live was a
martyr even if that story was a fiction
or at least an Elysian because Margaret
was never presented without stark choice
it was natural that Barry asked Claire
to perform at the memorial Margaret had
loved her music after a few months there
was a yes Claire to be part of a group
show of our artists that Margaret had
admired she brought Asha the gallery was
noisy and dusty except for Claire space
which was quiet and clean painted blue
and pink and strung with Garland&#39;s of
birds and little mess unconsciously
Claire says she&#39;d built a nursery for
asha Claire moved in with Barry and Asha
and San Francisco she&#39;d fallen in love
with both of them but she was also
driven by a cooler more mysterious
impulse a sense of obligation to a woman
she had never even really known she went
to train yards with Barry so that he
could graffiti boxcars is Margaret&#39;s tag
she learned to surf everyone remembered
Margaret&#39;s banjo playing Claire walked
the streets of the mission with the
guitar slung across her back holding the
hand of the little girl she now calls my
daughter at the same time Claire&#39;s
paintings began to bear an uncanny
resemblance to Margaret was it an
appropriation or an act of selflessness
or some strange amalgam of the two
Claire was a young ambitious artist
processing her experiences through her
work the guilt the loss the ghostly love
triangle she was memorializing Margaret
extending her purchase on the human
plane but to others it was clear Claire
was there in Margaret&#39;s place living a
life that didn&#39;t belong to her painting
a lie somehow to blame Claire says I
went under two shadows Margaret&#39;s and
berries and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m out of it
yet four years ago she decided to
abandon the feminist narratives that has
been present in her work since her
school days all her work now is abstract
the response people say it reminds them
of Margaret things Claire was told not
to wear hair clips not to wear corduroy
is not to paint a woman not to use the
color red that Barry had turned her into
Margaret because he missed her but Barry
just wanted her to be his maid it was no
wonder if she felt like an imposter
Margaret&#39;s clothes filled the dresser
drawers her materials were stacked on
every available surface Claire ate her
meals on furniture Margaret had dragged
in from the street an old Happy Meal
Margaret has found interesting was left
in place the same went for a donut and
some Ho Hos Claire resented it and she
resented herself for presenting it in
order to stay she had to believe
margaret was an angel margaret was a
martyr from one point of view Margaret
staff had given Claire her life there
was no room to complain or even tidy up
berries morning was reiterative
ever-present and never happening he
surfed and he worked incessantly just as
Claire disappeared for a while inside
Margaret&#39;s style she also lost herself
in the work that was left to her to do
starting at the age of 25 she took care
of Asha at ash&#39;s school people assume
that Claire Haas Peruvian short and
strong to ashes with
was the nanny Claire adopted Austin 2008
to this day she refuses to have her own
baby though Barry begs her she&#39;s afraid
of what would happen if she were to die
who you might be asking is the real
martyr Greece is slow and the stuff of
the Dead is obstinate a few years ago
clear insisted that buried box up
Margaret stuff and take it to his studio
he can&#39;t yet bring himself to sort
through it it sits there and cartons and
in stacks out of you where it can&#39;t make
him sad in the studio Barry showed me an
old painting of Claire&#39;s something he&#39;d
rescued from the garbage in a fanciful
Margaret asked font she&#39;s painted the
word out wait these days purging old
belongings is becoming a family pass
time while I was visiting officer
cleared two bags of give away stuff and
two bags of garbage from her room at
thirteen she&#39;s tall and slim with a
gentle easygoing sweetness so
reminiscent of her mother that her
grandmother often slips and closed her
Margaret in recent months friends of
Margaret&#39;s have been reaching out to
Asha wanting to impart something of
Margaret&#39;s spirit now that she&#39;s old
enough to understand oh my god girl
Claire said seeing haces clean room she
asked if she&#39;d like to put a cozy
reading chair in there you can have
Margaret&#39;s chair how about that Claire
said Asha bounded to the living room and
lays sideways across a big
mustard-colored upholstered chair I want
to get rid of it Claire said officer
replied and that&#39;s my favorite chair
Claire still thinks about Margaret every
day sometimes it&#39;s from joy and
sometimes it&#39;s from frustration and
sometimes it&#39;s from sorrow she said she
gave me ahsha and I will obviously never
forget that but on a basic level the
adoption freed her
with it she literally felt like she was
saying goodbye to Margaret Barry wants
to exist in the present stay alive move
on he stopped using Margaret&#39;s tag and
no longer agrees to request that he
recreate her wall paintings for Museum
shows so in his head he sometimes so
here&#39;s the haunting sound of Margaret&#39;s
banjo roll he too is slowly saying
goodbye but I got this scent watching us
to clear the space in her room and leapt
to get her chair also who is at the
threshold of her life as a woman an
artist in the making already a source of
inspiration for both Barry and Claire a
kind child whose empathy her father
thinks comes from being raised by
grievers that she also is just about to
say hello
thank you
you
