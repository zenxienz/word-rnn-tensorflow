I arrived to Gaza roughly two months
after the latest war in 2014 upon
arrival to the first farming family I
already knew a grieving soro awaited me
the family home of Jamila&#39;s Anina and
her offspring had been leveled to the
ground the only remaining structure of
the house was a stairway to their
balcony a sore reminder and attached the
moni that the rubble was once a home her
family has hosted me and my fixers
during my previous visit the table was
full of delightful Palestinian dishes
such as Matt Luba hummus and the data
salad pale white eyebrows and Jamila&#39;s
face have struck me from the last time I
saw her the color has completely
vanished from them the families of work
with have all been seriously affected by
the atrocities of war most of them have
lost their farmlands and their homes in
worst cases develops their family member
I started examining foreign and domestic
social issues and tensions I believed
were fundamental outcome of a war while
still a teenager my camera enabled me to
articulate what I perceive as the
Western indifference towards people
living developing countries quoting
between the interests of geopolitical
superpowers samira&#39;s deberry whose leg
was amputated during the second war in
gaza in 2012 had to hire workers to help
him cut and remove of what was left from
his completely destroyed olive tree
plantation in the southern town of Rafah
that the berry family lived next to the
farm but their house got destroyed
during the war so they now have to rent
another home war has critically weakened
the agricultural economy and left much
of the Funland destroyed or unable to be
cultivated during my previous visit in
the same period in 2013 it was
harvesting season this year all leaves
egg plants and clementines were not
there to be harvested because most of
the Palestinian farmland is located at
the so-called buffer zones a no-man&#39;s
land that was established as a safety
barrier between Israel and occupied Gaza
Strip farmers struggle to serve
I&#39;ve and provide for their families in a
very dangerous area bullets and tank
shells often land in their field Gian
and mohammed abu da were raising five
children in a town of hanina&#39;s their
house was located roughly 300 meters
from the israeli border even before the
last escalation of violence the lives
they were living would hardly be
imagined able to people fortunate enough
to live in peace along with the great
deal of land that the family has lost
due to the establishment of the buffer
zones the remaining land was considered
to be too dangerous to use so workers
didn&#39;t want to come work work for
Mohammed in addition the family
transformed their rooftop into a
playground a playground that was
surrounded by fences tanks and sniper
towers Mohammed ng and did their best to
be good parents so the children would do
well in school in fact their kids were a
students after the war the family was
forced to move into a shelter home and
now live in a United Nations refugee
school in an overcrowded classroom with
several other families as a result the
children&#39;s focus and will to study
dropped their mother says that they&#39;re
too stressed out from living in the
classroom and that they&#39;re too tired
from waking up at four in the morning
every day the kids are now hiding their
grades from their mother and father
embarrassed because they&#39;re not doing as
well in school the overall situation of
Palestinian farmers is more than
unfortunate thousands are still numb
from the war and are still coping with
loss others are trying their best to
restore their lands and despite the lack
of heavy machinery such as tractors and
bulldozers so that they can thereby
restore their only income we were
sitting in Holly&#39;s earnings farm in the
northern part of the strip when a man on
a donkey cart passed us by they greeted
each other by raising a hand and a
little after holiday told me that the
man a fellow farmer has lost 17 members
of the family and was the only one that
survived 17 a great majority of
casualties in modern conflicts aren&#39;t
the fighters this is why I aimed my
camera at the world beyond fighting and
blood and work to document the ongoing
life after the war a life that is a fact
by the devastating consequences and
inhumane acts of violence for me the
main story of every war isn&#39;t the
fighting what the military casually
calls the collateral damage in other
words civilians and their struggle to
survive long after the bombing has
stopped thank
