so I&#39;ve been trying to master the art of
listening ever since attending my first
ted conference I was mesmerized I found
myself hanging on the word of FM speaker
some of them made me laugh a few of them
made me cry I handful of them really
scared me but I found myself seeing the
world through a whole new lens at the
risk of sounding slightly dramatic I
felt literally transformed by the
experience I could not wait to go home
and tell my friends and family about the
things that i had heard her but sadly
that feeling of transformation
disappeared almost immediately after
leaving Ted and while paid close
attention the information i heard became
more elusive harder I tried for calling
no mutation have been surprised because
I&#39;d heard from almost 100 speakers in
five days time many of whom were talking
about things that I had never heard of
but I think issues more fundamental than
that I think it&#39;s a difference between
hearing and listening should you only
hear with your ears but you listen with
your mind and so this is the eve of my
eight ted conference and ever since that
first year I go to every test with the
intent purpose of trying to savor every
moment live in the present absorb as
much material as possible and find ways
not just to stay in the content but the
spirit is a conference of the whole so
I&#39;ve developed five lessons here&#39;s what
I&#39;ve learned so far the first is for
giving your all now it seems obvious but
the first piece of advice I got from Ted
was don&#39;t miss a moment and yet in 2008
I made the decision against my better
judgment to schedule business call in
the middle in the program I took some
comfort having looked at the schedule
incident this is the speaker I&#39;ve ever
heard of and she&#39;s talking about
neuroscience and I work in automotive
let the end of the world if I miss it
well the speaker i miss was Jill Bolte
Taylor talk about the stroke of insight
and if those of you aren&#39;t familiar with
her she came on stage with a human head
a human brain in her hands the spinal
cord is still attached she told the most
remarkable and personal story of what it
was like to experience a stroke of the
1837 and the way she describes us
medical emergency it&#39;s almost like a
spiritual awakening of course I can go
back and watch it online and I&#39;ve done
that but it&#39;s not the same as being an
audience and being part of a collective
dust and cops experience or words
firsthand so my second advice to you is
to take note now when you would I TED
conference you might find yourself in an
auditorium what heads of state captains
of industry Nobel Prize winners it&#39;s
easy to get very distracted but if you
take notes you&#39;ll find yourself staying
in the moment you&#39;ll be more engaged and
you have a better record of what took
place so since we were young we&#39;ve been
taught to listen with an analytical year
and just record the headlines but for me
that doesn&#39;t work I strive to capture
every single word as it&#39;s being said now
of course I fall short of verbatim and
my notes are filled with typos and lots
of gaps but what it does is it forces me
to entertain every thought of being said
because what I find is that most people
only tend to write down the ideas that
reinforce that they already believe so
if you strive to report everything then
you&#39;re not letting yourself the
opportunity to censor the content so I&#39;m
not an artist my background is in
finance and law and I work for an
automotive company but my favorite part
a pet is coming up with these drawings
and it&#39;s a luxury that only indulgent
when they go to the tech
but I go back and I look at the notes
and I had illustrations about all of the
essence of what they&#39;re trying to say
but what were the big things that came
across and sometimes woman being a
particularly good mom I said and color
them with my kids when i get home but
these notes they sit on my desk and they
serve as a reference a daily source of
insight and a reminder of inspiration as
a tech conference in February I took 121
pages of notes and I have four or five
volumes of the last heads that I&#39;ve
attended third piece of advice be open
to new possibilities now every speaker
deserves a chance to be heard we have to
challenge yourself to let go of our
biases our prejudices the way in which
we see the world of course it&#39;s easier
said than done but I ask you to quiet
that voice in your head that contradicts
what the speakers have to say because
they may open horizons so I think about
Harry Terkel the MIT professor with a
pioneer heralding the benefits of the
internet who a year or two ago took the
stage to talk about all of the concerns
the worry she had about technology
should not like the impact having on
society or tendency to make us escape
loneliness but more critically could our
reliance on digital devices mean that
we&#39;re limiting those moments of silence
where in sight an introspection are born
the birthplace of innovation if you want
to be really open-minded their number of
talks to talk about the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence and Who am
I to say that they&#39;re wrong I think
about the words of Karl saying induces
that when you consider our place in the
universe perhaps the little arrogant
processing that were the center of it
and even last talked we heard from the
founder the internet who said maybe the
Internet&#39;s next generation
interplanetary
so like 3rd lesson for you to challenge
yourself we&#39;re quick to label ourselves
right brain left brain can&#39;t we be a
balance of both so a couple years ago an
economist by the name of Daniel Kahneman
talked about the experiencing self and
the remembering self and he said that
the reason that we have such a hard time
understanding happiness it&#39;s because we
have two identities and the experiencing
self is always hijacked by the membrane
cell and I guess it was speaks to this
idea about listening what you listen to
or what you remember listening may not
be what you actually heard but what if
you lean a little bit more towards the
science TED Prize winner junior could
teach you about the importance of
changing art he said artisan intended to
change the world but it&#39;s powerful
because can change the way that you see
the world so my fifth lessons you is to
savor every moment I find that I my very
best version of myself when I met Ted I
more engaged I&#39;ve heightened awareness
and I&#39;m reminded that my viewpoint is
infinitely small the way to my favors I
try to capture nonverbal moments so
Natalie merchant&#39;s saying a couple years
ago 10 she&#39;s my all-time favorite artist
I&#39;ve seen her perform a concert many
times what my favorite performances of
one she gave a test it felt so intimate
early this year we also saw from a
Chinese artists who calls himself the
invisible artist and he literally hides
himself inside of paintings so one on
the would see you&#39;re right would you
collaborate they did with junior so you
can see the influence and how these
things come together my favorites all
times had talked in seven years of
attending head came from a three minute
attendee speech by 24 year old girl
named Glenn
for many she told tale of what it was
like to hear two years earlier by a
doctor on Christmas Eve the chance three
years left to live she had terminal
cancer machine ever since that moment
people that tried creates bucket list
for her but she had her own vision of
what should be done she said to date how
should spend your time she laughed she
cried she playin she&#39;s continued her
study in nursing so people except well
she must be in denial doesn&#39;t she know
the odds are that she may never become a
nurse and she said what every doctors
wrong what would have me do become a
brief that starbucks she said I can
barely order the coffee let a little
think about making it for others and
then she reminded everyone in the
audience she said I may be dying but so
are you so what kind of plans are you
putting forward so they revisit these
five tips about the art of listening
keeping the spirit of Ted alive give me
that you&#39;re all taking note of
everything that happens around you being
open to the possibilities challenging
yourself and savoring every moment I
wonder if these lessons apply equally to
the art of living because living estate
isn&#39;t the same as embracing life just
like hearing it was the same as
listening thank
