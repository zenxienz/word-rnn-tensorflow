so now what we understand is that all
bacteria can talk to each other they
make chemical words they recognize those
words and they turn on group behaviors
that are only successful when all of the
cells participate in unison and so now
we have a fancy name for this we call it
quorum sensing they vote with these
chemical votes the vote gets counted and
then everybody responds to the vote and
what&#39;s important for today&#39;s talk is
that we know that there are hundreds of
behaviors that bacteria carry out in
these collective fashions but the one
that&#39;s probably the most important to
you is virulence so it&#39;s not like a
couple bacteria to get in you and then
they start secreting some toxins you&#39;re
enormous that would have no effect on
you you&#39;re huge but what they do we now
understand is they get in you they wait
they start growing they count themselves
with these little molecules and they
recognize when they have the right cell
number that if all of the bacteria
launch their virulence attack together
they&#39;re going to be successful at
overcoming an enormous host hi I&#39;m
delighted to be back to give you a
little progress about what we&#39;ve been
doing in quorum sensing and so today I
want to tell you one story about how
we&#39;re taking what we learned about these
bacteria talking together and trying to
interfere with that conversation to make
a fundamentally new kind of antibiotic
and so the story I&#39;ll tell you about
concerns this pathogen pseudomonas
aeruginosa this is the bacterium that
kills people who have cystic fibrosis
it kills immune compromised people and
it causes effect infections when you get
a catheter a stent or a breathing tube
and the reason Pseudomonas is so
virulent is because of this chemical
communication this quorum sensing what
Pseudomonas does is that as it grows it
makes and releases small molecules which
are the red triangles on this slide and
so as the cells grow these molecules
that are outside of the cells increase
in proportion to cell number and as you
heard on the clip when the bacteria
detect that those molecules are there
they interpret that that means there&#39;s
other cells around and then as a
collective all of the bacteria together
make a biofilm which is how they sit on
services in tier two tissue and then the
group together secretes the poisons the
toxins that make us sick
so that&#39;s quorum sensing and so we want
to be able to interfere with that
conversation and so we know what the
molecule is that Pseudomonas talks with
it&#39;s the one that&#39;s on the left side of
this slide and so what we did using
chemistry is we change the structure of
that molecule to make the one that&#39;s on
the right and so what that chemistry did
was it changed the signal molecule the
word into an inhibitor so we changed the
molecule that turns on quorum sensing
into a molecule that shuts down quorum
sensing so what happens if you have such
a molecule so first I&#39;ll talk about
biofilms
so in this Petri plate what we&#39;ve done
is we&#39;ve put Pseudomonas in the middle
of the Petri plate and what I hope you
can see is that the bacteria have spread
out to the edges that&#39;s this biofilm
formation as a group they move out over
the plate and that could be like your
tissues but we have this inhibitor so
now if we do the experiment we put the
Pseudomonas in the plate and we add the
inhibitor what you can see is that the
Pseudomonas can&#39;t move so that&#39;s good
that&#39;s step one in the infection it
seems like our inhibitor can shut down
biofilm formation the next question for
us is what about these poisons these
toxins the Pseudomonas secretes so now
you&#39;re looking at an experiment and in
the left hand test-tube that&#39;s wild-type
Pseudomonas it&#39;s doing quorum sensing
and it&#39;s secreted these toxins and when
it secretes those toxins the bacteria
turn green in the middle test tube
that&#39;s a mutant that we&#39;ve made where
we&#39;ve knocked out its quorum sensing
system so that mutant has no
communication and what you can see is
that the bacteria are colorless they
can&#39;t secrete the toxin so they don&#39;t
turn green the right-hand test tube
shows you wild-type Pseudomonas that
we&#39;ve added our inhibitor and what I
hope you can see is that the inhibitor
greatly decreases the ability of
Pseudomonas to secrete that green poison
so now we&#39;re in business it looks like
at least in a lab we can shut down
biofilms and we can shut down tox and
secretion so what about in an infection
so in this experiment you&#39;re looking at
an animal a model system that we have
for Pseudomonas infection
the lab and all we do is measure whether
the animals are alive or dead and so on
the line that you&#39;re looking at
obviously if we don&#39;t add Pseudomonas
the animals are perfectly fine if we
give a Pseudomonas infection now what
you can see is that all of the animals
die within the first day after the
infection starts but if we do that we
give the Pseudomonas infection and we
give that inhibitor molecule that I
showed you what you can see with the
third line is that we can greatly
improve the outcome for the animal so in
fact we think now that there must be
merit to this idea of interfering with
chemical communication and that maybe
this could form the foundation of a new
type of therapeutic and so what we&#39;re
doing in the lab right now is we&#39;re
taking the molecule that I showed you
and we have to make it more medicine
like we have to build in potency and we
have to make that molecule safe the
second thing is that we got inspired by
that biofilm experiment that I showed
you and we&#39;re working with engineers now
to try to try to embed those inhibitor
molecules into materials and the idea is
that maybe we could make infection
resistant catheters or stents or
breathing tubes and then finally I&#39;m
just telling you one little vignette
that&#39;s about Pseudomonas we work on lots
of globally important pathogens in my
lab and we&#39;re having similar success
doing these kinds of strategies in other
bacteria as well and then to finish I
just want to show you the two students
who did the work Colleen O&#39;Laughlin and
Neutra sure they both work in the lab
and I&#39;m lucky to get to work with them
every day thanks for having me back not
so interesting
