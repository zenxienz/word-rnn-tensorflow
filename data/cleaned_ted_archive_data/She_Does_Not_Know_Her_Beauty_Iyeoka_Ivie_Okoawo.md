my name is yokai EA at a womano Crowell
my father named me after my grandmother
my name means I want to be respected she
does not know her beauty she thinks her
brown skin has too many flaws if she
could see her image in the owner of a
river where her mother was born she
would know but the city holds no clear
streams website streetlights shade the
sunsets miracles and the concrete covers
the soft memory of the earth unborn seed
black is the color of her press and
burned hair she thinks her curls are too
tight and short if she could feel her
natural birth lock blow in autumn okey
just rest breathe on the hill her father
once stood she would know but the girl
does not know her beauty she thinks her
lips are too thick if she could hear the
Benham men whisper thoughts across the
Atlantic Ocean praying to touch her
heart
Hoffa just one kid she would know that
the girl does not know her beauty she
chooses to believe that her eyes are
dark and troubled no one told her evany
was the color of the universe&#39;s wings
she thinks her nose is too flat her
breasts too small her legs too long in
other land her to dance you know never
learned how to run in the banks of a
Golden Pond embrace her existence guided
by the light of a tropical dawn she
forgets her name means Eevee a precious
child who harbors the beauty of an ocean
pearl she forgets she received her soul
from her grandmother adopted the spirit
of her mother if he can recall the
celebrations they had at her birth she
would know if I could reach her she
would know she would know I would make
it so there is cause for her to know
that she is more than a motherless child
victim of an impressionable faith
helplessly born inconsistent society&#39;s
interpretation of what beauty stands for
but I cannot reach her if she chooses to
be blind only she can choose to see but
the city holds no clear streams West
Side streetlights shade the sunset
miracles and the concrete covers the
soft memory of the earth unborn feed my
name is yoga EJ arable mental power
thank you
[Applause]
