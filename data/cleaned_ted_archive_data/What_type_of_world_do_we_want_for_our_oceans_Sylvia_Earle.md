so huh
five years ago Ted tried a new way to do
what it does so well that is to foster
ideas worth spreading ideas big enough
to change the world and so they
organized the first mission blue in the
Galapagos Islands aboard another
National Geographic Lindblad vessel and
here we are five years later in another
part of the Pacific Ocean and now the
stars are lined up in ways that have
never been possible before as never
before in the history we know what none
who preceded us could know it just gets
better in that way as we learn more and
understand more who we are where we came
from and maybe most importantly where we
might be going in the future it is
something like a race can we learn
enough soon enough to be able to keep
pace with the changes that we have
caused - the only place in the universe
that&#39;s suitable to sustain us so days
literally days after we returned from
mission blue one from the Galapagos
we got a wake-up call I did anyway most
of the world did because we could see
our power to destroy it wasn&#39;t
intentional but it happened and it&#39;s
just an example of the kind of power
that humans have developed in the matter
of a few hundred years to truly alter
the nature of nature what was it long
thereafter that I had a chance to
experience what it&#39;s like to swim
in a changing ocean in fact this is of
just an example of a place near Coco&#39;s
it&#39;s a world heritage area it&#39;s a hope
spot it is a place that is now awash in
a river of plastic we now see even now
even though we know better we&#39;re still
extracting wildlife from the sea in ways
that are clearly not sustainable
consider what we&#39;re doing to creatures
that once thrived in the high seas
sometimes near the shores swordfish
they&#39;re taken so relentlessly that they
really get to grow up to be big
swordfish Henry David Thoreau once
commented many years ago who here&#39;s the
fishes when they cry we need to think
differently about our relationship to
the ocean and the creatures who live
there we now know that the ocean drives
climate and weather
we know that the ocean is a source the
fundamental underpinnings of our economy
of our health our security a life itself
but it&#39;s not just those issues this we
now should be looking at as a moral
issue an ethical issue what are we doing
what are we doing to our mostly blue
planet so this is a glimpse of the Coral
Sea a place that I knew when it was as
robust as what you were seeing in here
what we are seeing here in this still
intact still beautiful part of the
Pacific Ocean there are lots of reasons
for despair the deeper you go in the
ocean you&#39;d like to think the smaller
our footprint is but things are changing
we&#39;re moving deeper into the ocean now
with deep-sea mining not just deep-sea
fishing it seems that wherever we can
take ourselves we go with the attitude
of extracting from the very systems that
keep us alive lots of reasons for
despair but you know it there plenty of
reasons for hope as well and that is
what keeps me going I think it&#39;s just
the idea that it&#39;s not just all despair
plenty of reasons for hope and this is
the time as never before but not only we
know what we have to do but to actually
get on a business of doing it with
knowing comes caring and with caring
there really is hope that we can get it
right after ten years of analysis the
census of marine life that looked at the
past and the present and the future of
life in the sea came to the conclusion
that it&#39;s not all doom and gloom about
half of the coral reefs around the world
are in pretty good shape about 10% of
the sharks the tunas the groupers the
halibut and other kinds of creatures
large and small still remain despite
clear-cutting of wildlife in the sea
mostly at a rate that is increasing in
recent decades but they&#39;re not all gone
yet we&#39;re beginning to look at the
creatures in the ocean with new eyes
with a new respect about who they are
what they are and how they fit into the
greater scheme of things the greatest
diversity of life on earth is out there
down there the blue part of the planet
each creature every one of them is
essential to making the ocean what it is
I don&#39;t think there are any spare parts
out there they&#39;re all doing something
that makes the planet function in ways
that were in place long before humans
arrived on the planet for the little
fish the tiniest ones have their little
burrows and home places in the reef -
the largest fish in the sea
and yet many people think of fishes well
you know fish all fatigued or not 25,000
or so different kinds of fish get
labeled comprehensively as as fish or
more often as seafood fish and chips
fish chowder or catch of the day
rather like saying Kentucky Fried birds
or how about memo burgers fish&#39;s
economic units is currency not as living
components to be treated with a thorough
clinical considerations as well as
gastronomic considerations two years
after the Galapagos expedition I had a
chance to reaffirm what I&#39;ve learned
after 10 times of living underwater for
weeks at a time and thousands of hours
of diving what I learned within that
time is respect for life the respect for
life in the sea in ways that we have
come to respect Birds on the land and
other creatures not enough but the way
we have yet to understand the nature of
life in the sea getting to know them as
the ocean as a laboratory living in the
ocean to see it from the standpoint of
the creatures who actually live there to
become a sea creature I mean into a
sense we&#39;re all sea creatures anyway
as dependent on the ocean as any fish or
whale or carnal reef but it&#39;s getting to
be there and spend time with them to get
to see them the way we have with many of
the creatures on the land to recognize
every fish has its own face every one of
them has its own distinctive DNA just
like cats and dogs and humans and
whatever now we&#39;re beginning to
understand that these are wild life wild
creatures part of the planet that makes
earth what earth is
so the current Pope the Pope of Hope
suggests maybe we should do unto others
as others do unto us can you imagine
doing that with fish or just suppose we
we listened to the ocean listen to the
fish and thought about them in different
ways of course fish can&#39;t speak for
themselves it&#39;s up to those of us who
can see them and speak for them but what
if we listened to the voice of the ocean
we have done so with whales by the
middle of the 20th century after
centuries of regarding whales as
commodities people began to see whales
with new eyes they began to listen to
their songs
[Music]
but for some whales are still considered
pieces of meat just as many regard tuna
lobsters shrimp and other wildlife in
the sea as commodities or as currency
sometimes even as a source of sustenance
in the past whales were mined from the
ocean and threatened treated as just
goods just the way many fish are today
but now we know what we could not know
before now that we&#39;ve spent time
actually exploring the ocean getting to
see it from the inside out and from high
above now we know what no one could know
that when I began exploring the ocean
many years ago new technologies enable
us not only to see the world from high
above look at the ocean look at the
polar areas but to document to record to
measure and to figure out what the
consequences are of what we&#39;re doing to
the planet we now know that the planet
is warming planet is changing it&#39;s
warming faster now than any time in
human history as Arctic ice melts we can
document it we can measure it we can
plan where where&#39;s this going anyway
good news for shipping bad news for
polar bears bad news really for us as
the ice diminishes the chances of
survival for the creatures who live
there naturally also diminishes and our
survival chances for that diminished -
now we know these things although it
might seem that warming could be a good
thing in some ways
there are consequences that relate to
the warming of the melting of the ice
owing to what we&#39;re doing to the planet
that is driving right now this year this
moment while we&#39;re here in the Pacific
Ocean we&#39;re in the midst of the of the
greatest coral bleaching event that
we&#39;ve ever recorded that&#39;s cause for
concern it cause for hope that we know
it exists
what if we didn&#39;t know this was
happening or understand why it was
happening or understand why storms are
getting more frequent and more intense
but now through the technologies that
enable us to understand the causes of
many of the problems excess carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere and in the
ocean we can now see solutions
protecting the natural systems that not
only extract carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere but also admit oxygen that&#39;s
vital to life as we know it if you&#39;d
like to breathe and listen up protecting
mangroves marshes seagrass meadows it&#39;s
critically important to take care of
these systems that keep us alive in the
ocean small photosynthetic organisms
hold the planet steady by capturing
carbon by emitting oxygen by driving the
great ocean food webs it&#39;s important to
take care of them to have that there it
is ocean food chain in action the
important thing when you get in the
midst of something like this is not to
actually become a part of the food chain
in action but what you can see is okay
sunlight photosynthesis food oxygen
right up the food chain to drive and
power the great ocean predators and
ultimately shape the character of the
ocean chemistry
in the past five years since mission
blue one there&#39;s been an increasing
awakening to what we should have been
aware and concerned about and what seems
obvious when you think about it that the
oceans the ocean and all that it holds
is actually the most effective carbon
capture and sequestration or storage
system that exists or ever has existed
we now speak of blue carbon what a
concept
we know that trees are carbon capturing
and storage units so we give carbon
credits for trees what about fish would
have helped dolphins and whales what
about all life in the sea it&#39;s a living
planet chock-a-block full of
carbon-based units that hold the planet
steady we need to have new ways of
thinking about the value of the
creatures that are there of course it
relates to climate change just as
natural systems on the land do as well
so new technologies have come along that
have made possible access even to the
deepest parts of the ocean now we can
see the ocean and sea ourselves with new
perspective new eyes new understanding
fewer systems currently exist to enable
humans to go see them for themselves the
nature of what&#39;s below the surface I
mean we can get down those divers
snorkelers whatever to the skin of the
ocean but the average depth is two and a
half miles and all of it matters right
down to the greatest steps seven miles
down what are we thinking you know there
are thousands of aircrafts and thousands
of millions of cars millions of boats
how many submarines that enable us to
see the other part of the planet that
heretofore has not been accessible to us
but we have the technology what we lack
is the will to get down there and see
for ourselves
what&#39;s lurks within the ocean itself and
yet every scientist every kid every CEO
every president every person every
citizen should have
to the blue part of the planet all the
way down we go seven miles on describe
what&#39;s keeping us from going regularly
seven miles to the deep parts of the
ocean we need not just systems that can
take us personally although we certainly
do need them we also send our presence
remotely into the sea harnessing the
technologies that now exist we could
only dream about 50 years ago we&#39;re
dreaming about but now they&#39;re here
within our grasp this is a moment in
time as never before and you&#39;re here
maybe as never again because things are
changing fast
one thing that is exciting is to
understand that nations do have
jurisdiction now out beyond the land
that we know and love us our countries
so early this year the United Nations
after years of deliberation has finally
agreed to a process that would make it
possible to protect the high seas beyond
national jurisdiction with an
implementing agreement that can lead to
come to governance and ultimately
protection of areas in the high seas
that now in a sense are owned by
everyone that protected by no one island
nations in the Pacific and globally have
begun to exert their authority in their
own exclusive economic zones to protect
large areas of the ocean securing their
assets giving marine life safe havens
blue parks I mean what a concept early
in the 20th century this was an idea for
the land now we&#39;re beginning to look at
the ocean including the deep ocean we
think of the ancient trees worth saving
how about the ancient corals that are
thousands of years old
how about getting transportation systems
that will take us out to sea the
wondrous geological formations as well
as the biological ones in the deep sea
an area
that has been protected for 15 years is
giving us cause for hope that we can use
our new insight our new technologies use
our minds to grasp the significance of
restoring places that have been depleted
cabo pulmo is a beacon of hope it had
been fished depleted to the point where
literally there was little for the local
people to catch but here&#39;s the big idea
the people themselves sort of took note
of the need to protect and restore a
place that was important to them and
soon after the Galapagos expedition in
2010 I had a chance for the first time
to visit this place and then later 2012
most recently earlier this year to meet
with Jeremy Jackson who was on the first
mission blue expedition to conspire with
him and the people who live there to see
what could be done to enhance their hope
for a place that now has been protected
and with with luck we&#39;ll continue to be
protected not just for the creatures who
live in the sea but for the people who
live by the sea and recognizing that
literally all of us live by the sea if
protect the ocean we protect ourselves
of course but it&#39;s only coming into
focus right now that when you take
action you can go too far we can have
lost species we have lost systems in the
ocean but if you come soon enough with
protection restoration is possible so
here&#39;s the plan to develop a global
framework engaging people communities
organizations like cabo pulmo working
with the local people listening to them
and using their sense of caring about
their future and in partnership with it
national union for the conservation of
nature that represents more than a
hundred governments and nearly a
thousand organizations represents people
around the world with scientists teams
of scientists in 45 locations around the
world to harness that framework and give
people a place they can go to empower
them to start the process to wind up
eventually with official protection for
the places they care about presently
more than a hundred places have been
nominated as hope spots and we need to
be able to respond to that interest to
that love to that hope actually there
are other ways of course other
organizations are doing their part to
protect the ocean the National
Geographic with a pristine seas
expeditions leading to protection
working with governments and working
with people 20 areas that are have been
identified as being in really good shape
worth protecting and some success has
already been realized well all of the
pristine seas our hope spots but hope
spots don&#39;t have to be pristine in fact
most of them aren&#39;t they&#39;re places that
with care can recover like cabo pulmo
it&#39;s an idea there&#39;s worth spreading
an idea that could change the world
embraced by people wherever they are you
know there was a time we thought that we
could do anything to the ocean that we
wanted to no problem but now we know the
ocean is not too big to fail
now we know what our predecessors could
not know plenty of reason for hope but
only if we act on what we know we&#39;re
living with policies that were set in
motion sometimes hundreds of years ago
ethical policies dominion over over life
on Earth an attitude that we are the
boss of the world we&#39;re part of the
world and it&#39;s our job as individuals
who can now bring about change because
hope for the future it&#39;s never before we
have a chance to do just that
2012 at the UN conference and Rio the
headline was what is the future we want
what&#39;s the future we really want we have
the power to shape it we have to hurry
because there are tipping points that
have begun to move beyond the point of
no return can you imagine a world
without sharks can you imagine an ocean
without tuna without coral reefs can you
imagine a world without us huh
lots of things you can imagine I&#39;d like
to imagine the world with hope this is a
time when we have choices we still can
shape the future that we want protect
the ocean as if our lives depend on it
because they do thank you
[Applause]
