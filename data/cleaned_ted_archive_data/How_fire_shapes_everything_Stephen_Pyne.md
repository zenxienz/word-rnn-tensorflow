when I was 18 I signed on as a smoke
chaser at the North Raymond Grand Canyon
and began a career as a PI romantic not
a pyromaniac important distinction on a
fire crew you soon learned how fire
shaped a season and how fire seasons can
shape a life and I wondered if the same
might be true for Humanity after all we
are a uniquely fire creature on a
uniquely fire planet so eventually I
traded in my Pulaski for a pencil and
then a PC and became a scholar on fire
so let&#39;s gather around this figurative
campfire called a TED talk and let me
tell you the story of fire on earth and
of the keystone species that for good or
ill has become the keeper of the
planetary flame and how we&#39;ve created a
world with too much of the wrong kind of
fire too little of the right kind of
fire and it&#39;s making our world less
habitable well let&#39;s begin with fire
among the ancient elements fire is the
odd man out earth air water all are
substances fire is a reaction it
synthesizes its surroundings it takes
its character from its context and that
makes it a shape-shifter but it&#39;s also a
shapeshifter intellectually you know all
the other ancient elements have got
academic disciplines devoted to their
study the only fire department on the
University campus is the one that sends
emergency vehicles when the alarm sounds
the fundamental setting for fire is the
living world life created oxygen life
created fuel the fundamental chemistry
of fire is a biochemistry and the
sentence begins on izing land they
burned and they&#39;ve been burning ever
since but they burned in a way that was
very patchy some places some eras had
lots of fire routinely others only
episodically
or even rarely and one reason is that
life did not control the third element
of the fire triangle namely ignition
well that changed when a creature
arrived who could wrest control of
ignition away from lightning and fire at
will and at that point we complete the
cycle of fire for the circle of life but
we got a lot - we got small guts and big
heads because we could cook food we went
to the top of the food chain because we
could cook landscapes and now we&#39;ve
become a geologic force because we&#39;ve
begun to cook the planet seems we&#39;re
intent on turning earth into a kind of
crock-pot well we hold this particular
fire power as a species monopoly you
know other animals knock over trees dig
holes in the ground hunt we do fire
that&#39;s our unique ecological signature
but our fire power comes with real
limitations not every spark spreads not
every fire is going to behave as we wish
and the reason is that the power to
propagate resides in the setting so we
began changing the setting with Slash
woods we drain pee we loose livestock in
a score of ways we began altering and
magnifying the combust ability of the
places we inhabit but this too has has
its limitations you know you can only
coax or coerce so much out of a setting
before it begins to degrade and if we
want more power and it seems most of us
always do we have to find something else
to burn well we found it by assuming and
burning lithic landscapes coal oil gas
and the rest these are the fossil fallow
of an industrial society and with them
we have begun once more to remake the
world you know traditionally
we have thought of fire history as a
subset of natural history particularly
climate history but now it&#39;s becoming
clear the natural history including
climates or subsets of fire history this
new combustion burns without the old
ecological checks-and-balances burns day
and night winter in summer through
drought and deluge for a long time the
question the human quest for fire
concerned obsessed over sources finding
enough stuff to burn but now it&#39;s
becoming a problem of sinks the capacity
of land air and the oceans to absorb all
the byproducts of our burning well when
you begin industrializing it goes it&#39;s a
it&#39;s a huge phase change and I&#39;m going
to call it the pirate transition by
analogy to the better known demographic
transition because during this initial
phase there&#39;s a real ramping up of
burning there&#39;s a population explosion
and a lot of those fires are really
nasty and damaging and abusive but then
eventually the new order begins to
establish itself by technological
substitution and outright suppression
the population of fires plummets good
fires as well as bad fires it falls
below replacement values it can no
longer do the ecological work required
so if the pirate transition begins with
a kind of fire orgy it tends to end with
an ecological fire family while many
nations looked over looked across the
spectrum of really wrecked landscapes
and and adopted a program of
state-sponsored conservation to protect
their remaining estates in too many
cases colonial holdings from the ravages
of axe and fire
this was a global project it was
perceived from the Northern Rockies of
the United States to the central
provinces of India interesting index of
the reach of these ideas Rudyard Kipling
wrote a sequel to the jungle books in
which he describes what happens to
Mowgli after he grows up he joins the
Indian forest service and fights against
poaching and you guessed it fires only
much later would the paradox has become
palpable that in many cases setting
aside land to shield it from fire only
created permanent abodes for fire and
that the effort to suppress all fire
only create an ecological insurgency
that we can no longer contain well this
phase change runs like a terminator
through earth history and contemporary
geography sub-saharan Africa awash with
fires Western Europe ablaze with lights
well not all those lights are powered
directly by industrial combustion but
you can bet industrial fire is somewhere
fundamental in their chain of creation
and they all substitute for open flames
or a more a finer grain but more
politically radical example North Korea
distinctive by the absence of evening
lights but if you look at the day time
equally distinctive by the concentration
of open flyers so how does it work well
it&#39;s all around us we don&#39;t even see it
consider the setting we&#39;re now in at one
time a building like this would be
filled with working fires flames for
lighting heating cooking even
entertainment they&#39;re all gone we might
have an occasional symbolic or
ceremonial or token flame but otherwise
it&#39;s gone and yet
this space continues it&#39;s always the
fire is a kind of dark matter to be
shaped by fire the materials you&#39;re
sitting on have all been tested for
flammability this room is equipped with
automatic sprinklers and smoke detectors
the design of the seating and its
capacity is determined aligned with the
exits all of which have special
illuminated signs with their own
autonomous power sources so apart from
those token or ceremonial flames however
the only fire that might occur here is a
wildfire and that turns out to be a
pretty apt metaphor for industrial
landscapes generally so we see if I can
summarize it&#39;s very brief history of a
very big subject for aeons natural fire
prevailed but it was lumpy in space and
time
and people come we increase ignition by
orders of magnitude and we began
rearranging landscapes
to make them more combustible the domain
of fire expands vastly and the pulses
and patches are recoded and then we come
to industrial fire it competes with all
the others and this time we have to
think about the landscape as thick
because we&#39;re taking stuff out of the
geologic past and we&#39;re lofting it into
the geologic future so two grand realms
of combustion seemingly unconcerned
preak of fires none of which play well
with the others how are we going to
divide three into two and have something
left over because if we fail we simply
cede the world to fear Oh fire how we
cope will depend however not only on our
technology but how we imagine ourselves
in the world this is the Aspen fire
boiling over the Santa Catalina
Mountains and bearing down on biosphere
2
two very different visions of the future
biosphere two a completely engineered
self-contained entity something that in
principle could be plopped down on
another planet has no tolerance zero for
fire every fire prevented or put out as
a problem solved for the Santa
Catalina&#39;s free burning fire is both
inevitable and essential and here every
fire put out is a problem put off
interestingly we can map these these two
visions on to prevailing images of fire
held particularly by Americans so here
from the 2000 fire season in the
Northern Rockies a view of fire as a
benevolent presence in a kind of
pristine nature and a year later fire is
a malevolent presence in a built
landscape what&#39;s missing in all of these
what&#39;s missing is some image or
narrative of ourselves in that scene as
constructive agents using fire to make a
more habitable world so let&#39;s go back to
the fundamentals fire in the living
world ourselves as holders of the torch
two narratives prevail one is the
Promethean story
it speaks of fire as technological power
a fire is something abstracted from its
setting perhaps by violence certainly
held in defiance of an existing order
well we need a lot less Promethean fire
we need to find surrogates for
combustion as a source of generic energy
the other narrative is amor let&#39;s call
it primeval fire and it speaks of fire
is a companion on our journey and
something of our shared stewardship with
the world around us I I particularly
like the kid with the fire stick no
wonder he&#39;s grinning
but how else is he going to learn to
burn properly we need a lot more
probably Mieville fire because fire does
biological work that nothing else does
so as we enter the future the earth is
shedding its cycle of ice ages for a
fire age our relationship to fire made
that possible our past is a record of
how we have used our fire power our
future will be a record of what we have
learned from that experience but you
know I&#39;ll bet that when the time comes
to tell that tale we choose to do it
around the fire thank you
