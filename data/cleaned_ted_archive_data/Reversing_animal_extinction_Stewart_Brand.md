go away thank you the idea of the
extinction first went public just last
spring that Ted and TEDx and in
Washington DC 25 scientists held forth
and a new idea went completely public
thanks to Chris Anderson by the way that
happened I&#39;ll report a little bit what&#39;s
happened just in the months since then
one of the speaker&#39;s was a woolly
mammoth expert who had discovered that
the closest living relative of the
mammoth was the Asian elephant now that
you know Mike closeness that close you
can conjure you could use this amazing
new genome editing tool called CRISPR
and which is sweeping the biotech labs
and one of the people using it is George
Church at Harvard on a known mammoth
gene for the production of cold tolerant
heat haemoglobin and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a test
the test is far along they&#39;ve moved the
gene from the computer into living
elephant cells and the science article
will come out of this this is the state
of progress
George has four postdocs working on this
and their ultimate goal is vast herds of
new Canadians
or return to Canadians back in the
Arctic where they belong
we may need them back a Russian
scientist named Sergei seamoth has a
theory
that would put the manless to work he
says that the world&#39;s largest biome used
to be what was called the mammoth steppe
it was Arctic grasslands kept in order
by dense herds of mega herbivores
including mammoths when humans killed
them off Tundra and boreal forests took
over and right now thawing Tundra is
releasing greenhouse gases grasslands if
they could be restored fixed carbon so
to prove his case Sergei is created in
northern Siberia and place called
Pleistocene Park for as dense herds of
animals like musk oxen and they are
indeed grazing and trampling the tundra
into grassland and Sergei is waiting
patiently for mammoths to come and join
his herds to help stabilize climate
change next animal passenger pigeon okay
in North Dakota science fair ben novack
imagine how he could bring back the
extinct dodo 12 years later we employed
in full time to bring back the extinct
passenger pigeon here he is at the Paleo
genomics lab at UC Santa Cruz preparing
passenger pigeon DNA for sequencing
which will then be compared to the DNA
from this closest living relative which
is the band-tailed pigeon and results
from that will give us a sense of the
population history of passenger pigeons
going back many millennia and it will
show the way to possibly bring
passengers and passenger pigeons back
for future millennia Beth Shapiro has
three students working on this project
the science paper is in progress will
come out this year and an interesting
fact about the past
visions that are dimorphic the male is
quite gorgeous but it&#39;s not for our
benefit
it&#39;s for the female but this then raises
the question of who exactly has been
apparent the first revived passenger
pigeons well at the Bronx Zoo in New
York there is a flock now of band-tailed
pigeons who are being groomed to become
eventually the first surrogate parents
of a revived formally extinct offspring
next animal one of the founders of
conservation biology said at TEDx the
extinction the biotech could help solve
one of the most serious problems that
faces endangered species it&#39;s called
extinction vortex and what happens is
that very small populations remnant
populations in breeding and genetic
drift makes the animals less fit which
leads to a smaller population which
makes more animals they&#39;re less fit and
so on down to nothing
any form of somehow restoring genetic
variation and variability is called
genetic rescue the idea is to somehow
turn this whole process backwards and
get out of the extinction but the
extinction vortex so we got asked by a
government agency to see if any of this
could help black footed ferrets
Nestorian ferrets is they lived solely
on prairie dogs and when farmers and
ranchers declared war on prairie dogs
the ferrets were collateral damage and
they were declared extinct in the 1970s
but then ah but then in 1981 a tiny
remnant population was discovered in
Wyoming but there&#39;s just seven founders
and with just seven founders you know
there&#39;s going to be in breathing
problems so then you wonder if maybe
and the museum specimens there to be
restored basically old gene variants
that could be brought back into the
current population and in a sense young
ferrets could breed with their
genetically richer ancestors now there&#39;s
a lot of captive breeding going on in
this government program they&#39;ve produced
thousands of ferrets and many have been
released to the wild Ryan and I got to
go along on one of these release events
where we discovered that a ferret isn&#39;t
necessarily thrilled to go down into a
hole probably occupied by a horrified
prairie dog and they&#39;re fast and they&#39;re
smart and they bite
[Music]
so research is now going ahead if you
see if biotech can help these animals
make them more brave and so we&#39;re right
now sequencing two animals from the
living population doesn&#39;t hurt them two
from the frozen zoo in San Diego which
may have some nice old DNA which is
richer and that is going ahead with this
is just a tiny portion of the people
who&#39;ve dedicated their lives to saving
this exquisite creature and part of the
idea is this is such an model animal
that if this form of genetic rescue
works for the black-footed ferret then
it may well be able to work for other
endangered species it could help
revolutionize conservation it certainly
revolutionized us because we discovered
that our original mission was too
limited and in fact it needs to broaden
so that we&#39;re not just reversing
extinction that we&#39;re helping prevent
extinction if all goes well these
animals will be around long after we&#39;re
gone what about the ferret who had
doubts well I can say that he made his
peace with living wild
thank you
