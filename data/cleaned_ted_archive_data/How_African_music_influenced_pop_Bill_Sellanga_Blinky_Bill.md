in his book how music works david ban
one of the members of the band talking
heads says something that about rhythm
that i found very interesting he said we
are all Africans and this is something I
like because for the longest firstly for
the longest time a lot of Africans I
felt that our contribution to humanity
hasn&#39;t been valid or solid and secondly
the influence of African music on pop
culture is immense but has been
downplayed severally like often one of
my one of the best examples of this is a
song called Paulette and it goes a
little something like this
[Music]
Anto sampled by a hip-hop musician
called Jayco and he gave us something a
little like this music doesn&#39;t exist in
a vacuum
we&#39;re always influencing each other
James Brown for example had a huge
influence on Kenyan bands in the 70s a
lot of them sounded like him and one of
them that we had a Kenyan bandleader
called Kelly Brown back home and yeah
and so you listen like James Brown&#39;s
Jonah&#39;s funk music funk is influenced a
lot by jazz and jazz it&#39;s influenced by
African music so it&#39;s cyclical some of
my earliest memories of the music my dad
and my mom used to play a lot of great
African musicians like Hugh Masekela
Miriam Makeba Franco and the works
I&#39;d like to say I like to listen to this
music but it was painful to my years I
hated it
and what I what I found myself
gravitating towards was Michael Jackson
which also played a lot on Kenyan radio
and one of the musicians that had the
huge impact on me was a band called the
mighty Cavaliers sir old Kenyan band and
they have a song called duniya naman
which I thought was perfection it&#39;s one
of my favorite Kenyan songs and
everything about it is I love
[Music]
I like everything about it but I wanted
to update the drums so that they have a
bit more punch and this is what I did
two years ago to that song
[Music]
so this musician what I liked about them
is like their exceptional they&#39;ve been
working on it on their music for the
longest time but one of the things is
that you know and back home considers
their contribution important and so with
working with this music I&#39;m going
backwards into Kenyan music history and
trying to bring it forth so that the new
generation that&#39;s listening to Kenyan
music which we are at the forefront of
pushing I exposed to these musicians and
their work and most importantly one of
the things I&#39;m beginning to find is that
a lot more people are tuned in Fela Kuti
once said I must find my identity in
Africa and therefore and then I will
find myself and in bringing this music
back people are beginning to know about
it
and looking back at what they did and
loving their contribution thank you very
much
