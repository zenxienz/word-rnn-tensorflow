are
do some science I&#39;m just placing some
glass slides here something that you&#39;ve
all seen before but now if you could
watch what I&#39;m watching you would be
seeing tiny little lightnings this is
the only part of the talk that will
actually have lightning I&#39;m gonna move
these little glass slides all I&#39;ve done
is just cleaned it up that&#39;s all and I
want you to play close attention things
will happen fast I&#39;m gonna take some
water this is just water I added some
food coloring to it to make it color and
we are going to place them on the
surface here and if you can cut to the
projection video okay not that exciting
it just sits there but wait a second
watch carefully
if you look carefully you&#39;ll notice
they&#39;re talking to each other to just
realize that something else was placed
right next to it this is just water and
they are signaling each other they&#39;re
actually computing which directions to
go and now I&#39;m gonna just play with it a
little bit you know why stop at green
let&#39;s add some color to it literally and
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all played with water
and food coloring before the ironic
thing is the phenomena that I just
showed you had never been seen before
what you just realize now they don&#39;t
like each other wait a second
the green is trying to run away and the
Reds trying to chase it like a little
cop car and they&#39;ll slow down and start
something again what&#39;s so fascinating
about what I just showed you
in the end it&#39;s something very simple
you might have seen it in your kitchen
although you didn&#39;t I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s I
find it fascinating it&#39;s it&#39;s such a
simple thing it&#39;s just water and some
food coloring sitting in and what we
discovered in this system is that these
systems have the capacity to communicate
signal and literally compute can you go
to my first slide so I could spend the
next hour actually explaining it to you
what just happened right there I spent
four years trying to figure this out
this talk is not about that I&#39;m not
gonna tell you anything what you just
saw but I&#39;m gonna invite you to go home
tonight find a little sharpie some food
coloring some really clean glass you can
buy some pre clean cover glass put these
things on and just watch them and I&#39;m
gonna share with you a very short clip
of video of what did I do for the last
four years and just watch this
[Music]
we can make them chase each other they
can climb Hills by the way about the
back of your head you should be thinking
where is the energy source
you can have them line up like a
soldier&#39;s and you can literally turn
them into a transfixed dance
[Music]
what&#39;s inside these little things are
tiny little tornadoes they&#39;re extracting
energy from evaporation to turn them
into physical objects this is actually
not that far from how physical cells
crawl around like your neutrophils
trying to chase bacteria blue doesn&#39;t
the orange doesn&#39;t like blue so they can
detect each other
so they know a sense of self and you get
the point
just go home and play tonight but what I
do want to mention today is there is a
sense of wonder in some of these very
obvious phenomenons that lie right in
front of us if they could fundamentally
understand some of these phenomena is
you have the chance to actually exploit
them and that&#39;s what we did and one of
the factors that we&#39;ll talk about today
is this idea that what you just saw tiny
little raindrops these little bits of
matter that you can literally make
machines out of these things and if
you&#39;re me you think about what is the
most ultimate machine that I&#39;m gonna
make which will end up being a universal
Turing machine any of you who think
about computation this is the simplest
possible machine that has the capacity
to emulate any computer in the world any
classical computer so it&#39;s not just fun
and games here if you think about the
history of computation all the way from
the jacquard looms to the Babbage
machines to every single electronic
computer that you&#39;re holding in your
pocket right now
they&#39;ve all been about the idea of
computation and about processing
information but laws of physics force
you to think about that information has
to be fundamentally physical a piece of
drawing on a chalkboard is physical
electrons running around in your
computer or physicals photons are
physical and that introduces this new
idea of a paradigm what if computation
did not just process information but
could actually process matter itself
this is an idea that I&#39;ve been obsessed
with for the last 10 15 years there is a
little bit of a history to it in the old
days this is a relic from the Space Age
when it got started
little Rockets were being built no
computer in the world had the capacity
to handle the gamma radiation
the temperatures of thousands of degrees
to actually control the nozzles and
there were Russian rockets flying around
working with tiny little fluid computers
that we were passing this material
around to be able to control it I don&#39;t
know what happens when something goes
wrong on a computer like that but it
didn&#39;t scale you&#39;re probably happy
didn&#39;t scale otherwise you would be
holding some vet laptops right now but I
started thinking about this more than 10
years ago I spent a lot of time in my
PhD my friends tell me playing with
bubbles and I did figure out a way to
build a universal computation using
purely fluids that scales at small
scales is decently fast enough but there
was something lacking
it was completely asynchronous and so
some a little bit of computation would
happen here a little bit there they
don&#39;t talk to each other very quickly
the whole thing would turn into chaos so
we went back to the drawing board again
and today I&#39;m going to present to you a
new platform that we are in leashing
which allows us to do synchronous
universal logic purely using fluids and
I&#39;m gonna actually get into the
technical details of how you can build
it and in the very end I&#39;m going to give
you a tool that allows you to actually
explore this so let&#39;s get started okay
you start with a little glass slide and
you pattern tiny little magnets these
are soft magnets what that happens that
gives you a little platform of a chip
and you put that inside some magnetic
coils you don&#39;t wind up some coils you
put them around you turn the coils on in
a way such that you can build a rotating
magnetic field one rotation of a clock
is one o&#39;clock you apply a little bit of
a bias feel to it that allows you to
actually magnetize the fluid droplet
itself now you realize that you can make
any shape you want I just drew a tee you
put that in a magnetic field and it will
actually magnetize but then when the
field changes the magnetization
orientation would change and you end up
with something like rolling hills all
remember the Microsoft desktop with
rolling hills
remember when you put a ball at a top of
the hill it rolls down that makes sense
in a system like this you put a ball on
top of a hill it would roll down but the
hills themselves are changing and you
end up in a cascade where the balls
trying to chase the hill at all times
and you get physical notion of this
matter now I have a better analogy than
all this technical stuff which is
musical chairs here&#39;s a chair that is
the energy trap I&#39;m talking about and
you are a little droplet a little bit of
matter you just sit there when the gong
goes tick-tock it&#39;s time to flip in a
musical chair game you switch to the
next closest chair you find and you move
to the next chair and you move to the
next chair and so forth now you can make
it a little bit more interesting what if
I turn and arrange the chairs around to
turn an infinite loop and you&#39;ll
actually be stuck in this loop forever
every time a clock thing sting you move
to the next chair this is a memory loop
this is a fundamental unit of memory
where you can essentially store bits of
matter and information at the same time
we actually built this here is an
experiment that allows you to now think
about this has been slowed down 10x and
what you allow to see are these tiny
little bits of matter running around
they don&#39;t need any instructions I
forgot to tell you there are no wires
all there is is a rotating magnetic
field you can do something a little bit
more exciting which is turned into a
marching army
these little things will just do their
thing forever you come back the next day
they&#39;re doing the same thing not that
exciting but I said it is matter that we
are manipulating I could put anything in
these tiny little things I could put
individual cells
I could put biomolecules I could
actually put patient samples inside
these little things and the way they
organized and arranged based on what you
run they will find a place and then
magically when I turn off the field
you&#39;ll see all of them freeze in place
right there and what you&#39;ve done
suddenly is you&#39;ve manipulated matter in
a very different way where there is a
state to the system so let&#39;s complicate
it a little bit imagine now I add a
little more number of chairs and now you
get two choices of chairs you go to the
closest chair to you and you move with
the gong of a clock you end up sitting
on another chair nothing has changed
you&#39;re still stuck in an infinite loop
unless another person arrives to play
the game
let&#39;s call red person Alice another
person Bob now Bob steals your chair and
now Alice has no choice but to find
another chair which is the closest next
chair and suddenly the fate of Alice has
changed
Bob stuck in the infinite loop Alice is
out what I just showed you is a
fundamental unit of computation it&#39;s
called the Ann gate only when Alice and
Bob come together there is actually an
output now when you start thinking about
computation you have to ask yourself can
I make a unit that allows me to make any
computer in the world we just did that
that allows us to make one single gate
that can make any logic that you can
imagine
billions and billions of these logic
gates are put together in your computers
to do anything you want to do at a clock
and now again Alice comes along now this
is the actual geometry instead of the
fake musical chairs when Alice and Bob
come together you notice they both
change and this gives rise to a universe
Lexx or gate and you know this is not
theory so you get to actually watch the
video right there both Alice and Bob are
now stuck in an infinite loop but this
demonstrates the idea that you can do
universal logic now I said a Turing
machine Turing machine has something
more fundamental which is it requires
memory how do you build memory so what
you&#39;re looking at is the tiny little guy
stuck there forever until a cue arrives
this is called a flip-flop a standard
flip-flop when put together turns into
registers registers give you rise to
memory and we have all the basic units
to build universal Turing machines
purely using little water droplets so at
this point you start thinking about wait
a second how how big can you how many
little drops can you arrange and I said
there are no wires so literally this
entire setup shrinks down and the
physics works out that you can really
shrink this down to a point where little
postage stamp chip has the capacity to
control hundreds and thousands of little
bits of matter now you&#39;re sitting on
your chair is like I don&#39;t need another
computer and I don&#39;t think you do why
why would you do this the fundamental
aspect is the fact that every single
diagnostic test when you saw Ebola when
these little machines were being shipped
out you get the tiny little chips but
then you have a huge amount of
infrastructure that goes into
controlling the chip because the chip
has actually no controls built in so the
cost of Diagnostics high-throughput drug
screening actually single-sim sequencing
in genomics is based on all these giant
robot factories that run and process
these information so there is an obvious
application applying some of these
fundamental principles to completely
change how we actually design some of
our chemical analysis factories
literally we have the capacity to make
an object that is size of a USB sticks
that you would plug in in a USB Drive
and has the capacity
manipulate matter with thousands of
little drug molecules and thousands of
little cells and nothing else but to me
there is something more fundamental
which is this idea that in our world
we&#39;re stuck with two ways of making
things there is the subtractive you can
take a chisel in chisel of a matter and
you can build stuff and the exciting and
3d printer base additive assembly where
you can assemble bits of matter the
capacity to process both information and
physical matter simultaneously allows
you to do something completely new which
is algorithmic manipulation of matter
which is literally what biology does to
build a developmental plan is an
algorithm so instead of making an object
you would write a single equation and it
spits out a physical object this is
exactly the directions we are at this
point but I want to be inclusive about
this as a technology so we put together
all our papers all the exact methods we
put it on a website we put together a
little tool a design tool that literally
if you work with Lego you are ready to
design this website is live right now
all the people who actually upload and
build circuits you can make a circuit
upload it out here we will be choosing
circuits on a bi-weekly basis and
actually build and share this with the
community because one of the goals is to
get this technology out to the broadest
group of people that now think very
differently about computers and I&#39;m very
excited to see what you would build
thank you
yes so correct me if I&#39;m wrong but what
you&#39;re saying is right now when we
output from a CPU or a computer of some
kind it&#39;s an electrical system that&#39;s
translated back into bits bits go on
computers or other devices and then you
if you want to manipulate matter with
those then you have to use a 3d printer
but what you&#39;re saying is you can not
only compute but you can manipulate
matter therefore cutting out that
interim process is that correct yeah
yeah I mean literally the output of this
object is not just a string of
information that somebody else has to
act on the output is physical matter
itself it&#39;s the organization of matter
that you put together so say 20 years
from now or 10 years from now and you&#39;ve
got this going even more maybe more out
of the lab and stuff can you give us a
just an example of like how someone at
work or at home might use this to output
matter so think of it this way think of
your hand your hand is made out of you
know maybe hundreds of billions of tiny
little cells this is the scale that
we&#39;re operating at that these little
droplets that I&#39;m talking about are
they&#39;re roughly the size scale of cells
for example tens of microns to build
something like this with a serial
process by putting one voxel at a time
it would take infinity it&#39;d take a very
long time but if you think about rules
of the game you realize a finger or a
hand this finger is literally a copy of
this so you&#39;ve taken code and you&#39;ve
literally copied it I could have a
finger on your hand with ten fingers
just copy-paste that iterative code and
that&#39;s exactly the point is the fact
that we might have the possibility to
build physical matter that&#39;s algorithmic
for example you might want to make a
fractal structure but literally when you
compute that fractal it&#39;s not just a
graphic piece it&#39;s literally physical
bits of entities put together right so
something you could actually you could
hold it on and give to your child to
play with or something like that so this
is pretty cutting-edge stuff right I
mean it&#39;s not not that many people doing
outputting matter from computers yeah
yeah every time you come on our
every time you come on our stage you
just blow our minds let me ask you
another quick question about your
project you showed at tEDGlobal a few
years back called full scope could you
tell people what it is in about 30
seconds but also like what has been the
impact of getting full scopes out in the
world so full scope is a microscope it&#39;s
origami microscope you put together you
do microscopy but the goal is to do it
anywhere we wrote a paper and then we
moved on to other stuff and we realize
nothing changed in the world actually
you know you realize when you write a
paper thing changes you have to do
something we decided we decided to build
a little manufacturing Factory inside
the lab we built the first 50,000 units
and we asked anybody who wants them we
would send them out after blood and
sweat a lot of work we shipped out these
50,000 units that around the world now
in 230 countries and kids around the
world including adults and everybody are
playing and doing microscopy out in the
field and the goal is fundamentally
change a scientific society where
curiosity is really what the starting
point is where you don&#39;t just wait for a
tool or complain that I don&#39;t have this
fancy tool so I can&#39;t do this but to
share the tool upfront and then this
community has the same sets of tools so
we have farmers in Mongolia who are
trying to test camel milk and kids in
Nigeria who are actually detecting fake
drugs yeah it&#39;s quite crazy
so this it&#39;s interesting that you you
distribute it in a two-pack so you&#39;re
encouraging social interaction around
science and they&#39;re about 50 cents each
roughly that&#39;s correct it costs us 50
cents to make the goal is when you get
one and some of you can get you have to
give it to somebody else that you think
will never ever ever see through a
microscope and that sort of allows for
this idea of science activism where it&#39;s
not just about you it&#39;s what you do with
that as a tool that yeah in correct me
if I&#39;m wrong but I believe this
microscope is sensitive enough to see
malaria is that right that&#39;s correct
we&#39;ve done tests for
we have field studies for
schistosomiasis African sleeping
sickness and one of the contexts that
ends up happening is we split up the
project into two themes although it&#39;s
sensitive to see malaria it takes a lot
more to do malaria Diagnostics right
which is training and everything so the
stream is not to wait there is a medical
part of this project there is the
education part anybody and everybody can
have and start playing and deploying and
getting trained because one of the
challenges in healthcare is not
technology frankly the tech month
the challenge is human capital when a
taxi driver starts driving a taxi in
Uganda why should he choose to fight
malaria and that&#39;s kind of the challenge
we are facing is combining healthcare
and science education together it&#39;s
amazing how much you and Jose are
similar Minds they get a drink tonight
thanks so much
I really pick mine is Macar
[Applause]
