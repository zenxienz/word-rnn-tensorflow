on October 17 2007 I was diagnosed with
anorexia nervosa with just one judgement
one moment my life was completely
shattered I remember sitting in the
doctor&#39;s office when I first heard the
news just glaring at my dad as if this
was his fault his problem his choice
that I was now cornered in this room
utterly undone by this word this disease
this thing but he didn&#39;t even look at me
he just stared right through me for
months I denied my diagnosis I soon
learned that my vital signs were
critically substandard my bone density
had shrunken to the point of osteopenia
and my levels of estrogen had plummeted
so drastically that I had lost my
ability to menstruate yet I fiercely
continued to defy the doctors and tell
myself that this challenge was not mine
it was another girl who was brave enough
to share her story with me who showed me
that I needed to face this challenge and
that I needed to change my perspective
her name was Rena Rena was a writer and
a spoken word artist an entrepreneur and
a creator most importantly she was a
thriver she had suffered emotional abuse
and molestation abandonment and violence
in her family yet she had learned to
heal herself by realizing and concluding
that her challenges for her strengths
and that her flaws were simply vessels
for her potential Rena opened her opened
my eyes to realization that thousands of
girls around the world were suffering
from disorders such as mine simply
because they did not have the self-worth
and mutual respect to appreciate all
humanity as unique gifts and work
together to demand and to create a more
accepting world so I made it my mission
to build a sisterhood of changemakers
that would empower all girls to assert
their voices and embrace their
collective capacity for change just so a
new vision and/or
was born one that in just three years
has mobilized and United thousands of
girls from around the world for a single
purpose peace you know Jacqueline
Novogratz shared in an earlier TED talk
and in her book that compassion is
simply not enough we need to bring
tangible skills and local knowledge to
the table in order to make a sustainable
impact and I fully agree with her but
when I think back to what I had to offer
three years ago at age 15 I realized
that it was simply an only compassion
I am the three friends I&#39;ve recruited to
work with me had absolutely no idea what
we were doing we needed to build a
website but we had never dabbled with
HTML or Java we needed to start a
corporate bank account but we didn&#39;t
even know how to manage our own yet we
had an idea an idea worth spreading so
simple that we made it the name of our
organization girls helping girls and we
launched our first chapter in India than
Ghana than Nigeria then almost - really
when we started receiving emails and
phone calls from girls in other
countries like Turkey and Bangladesh
girls just itching to change realities
but who simply didn&#39;t know how and like
a viral message our mission spread and
spread and spread until it became a
global movement unrestrained by a single
director but burgeoning with the mind of
its own today
our small team of just girls has trained
and mobilized over 30,000 young women to
create innovative and substantive social
change
with no hired advisors and not even with
any full-time staff we have provided
girls in more than 20 countries with the
one-on-one mentorship toolkits funding
and support network to build their own
micro enterprises and create sustainable
development initiatives in their
communities what we learned is that
there are no quick fix solutions for
girls empowerment I remember us watching
an advertisement several months ago that
suggested giving a sanitary pad to a
girl in the developing world would
change her life forever the pad would be
her ticket to a bright future and a
better education you know a happily ever
after
giddy with this idea we decided to
collect stockpiles we started calling
all our teams across the US and
collecting tons and tons of sanitary
pads and pads and toiletries to
distribute to our sites abroad and we
were so excited that we were totally
unexpected a letter that we received
from one of our girl leaders in Uganda
Josephine she bluntly say that you know
it&#39;s really kind of you to be shipping
us all these boxes of sanitary pads but
what we really need is a cultural shift
we need to heal fear grow tolerance not
give women simply another veil to mask
their shame another excuse not to talk
about this new stage of womanhood
and as we were thinking about this we
realized that in in trying to empower
these girls we were actually perversely
just entrenching them further in their
isolation from society by localizing the
politics of Education to a woman&#39;s body
instead of examining the larger
structural forces in play we were
fighting the burden of this problem on
the woman now I&#39;m still trying to figure
out how to remedy this approach and I
don&#39;t have all the answers but what I
can say is that I think it is always
important to try to foster dialogue from
the girls perspective
because sometimes building simply
building a safe space in which girls can
together debate and innovate solutions
is the best gift we can offer this poet
was driven home to me several months ago
when my team and I arranged a joint
activity between three teams of girls
one from an elite prep school in the US
one from an all-girls school in India
and another from a village in Ghana and
we asked all three teams all comprised
of girls aged 12 to 16 to tell us and
share with us how they would respond to
a particular scenario there&#39;s a woman
who&#39;s carrying a heavy pile of wood on
her back and a man is following her
carrying nothing now of course the team
in the u.s. responds this is a blatant
violation of women&#39;s rights and the man
should not coerce a woman to carry what
if she does not want to the team in
India responded that sorry the team in
Ghana responded that you know it&#39;s a
woman&#39;s role to carry wood and she is
simply acting according to her
community&#39;s code of conduct the team in
India responded that the sheet theme
showed women to be committed to
community leaders hardworking and strong
and that it was the man&#39;s place to
follow behind her and assist her if she
needed
now you know needless to say all of us
my team as well as the girls themselves
were quite surprised by the diversity of
responses but instead of causing
confusion this dialogue this activity
sparked a dialogue in which all three
teams talked about what it meant to be a
woman and not only that it led them to
collaborate on a global project in which
they hosted jointly during the same
weekend forums on this topic that are
now changing the way women and girls are
perceived in their communities and all
of this started from a single
conversation a simple exchange these
girls proved to me that when girls think
about and reach out to one another they
can empower one another to discover even
their most hidden assumptions and dreams
and then act to fulfill and share them
with others when in thinking back
actually to my own journey to the stage
I am recall two words that Rena shared
with me three years back she said Sejal
when you are a part of a sisterhood that
loves you that only wants to see you
soar it is absolutely impossible to fail
so this is my dream to grow this
sisterhood for all girls so that all
girls can be enabled to empower each
other stories the way they have
empowered mine for there is a special
magic that is created when a girl who
has been blinded to her own potential
learns to open her eyes and discover in
her own soul the living breathing
posting dreams of another for this it&#39;s
a secret of girls helping girls it is a
simple idea but one that can change the
landscape of social change forever
thank you
