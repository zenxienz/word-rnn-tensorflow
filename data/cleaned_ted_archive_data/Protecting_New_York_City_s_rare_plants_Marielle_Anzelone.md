okay I&#39;d like to introduce you to a New
Yorker who broke my heart this is Tori&#39;s
Mountain mint and while it may look like
a weed to you to me it&#39;s much more than
that this scruffy looking wild flower is
something really special a globally rare
plant with only 29 populations in the
entire world one population was found in
2003 on the south shore of Staten Island
right here in New York City the city
owned the land and should have preserved
it as a park but instead the site was
turned into a strip of big-box stores a
few of us fought to save this plant and
protect its habitat from development so
when the bulldozers finally came I cried
today if you go to the site you&#39;ll see
it the mint is still there but instead
of surrounded by forests it now lives in
a sad garbage filled strip surrounded by
a giant parking lot other New Yorkers
haven&#39;t been so lucky here a swamp pink
white milkweed and support shenton all
locally extinct all of them gone from
New York City so why does urban
biodiversity matter I mean aren&#39;t cities
places that have no nature anyway or if
they do it&#39;s just like pigeons weeds and
rats right well I don&#39;t see it that way
New York City has more forests more
marshes and more meadows than any other
city in North America nearly one eighth
of the big apple looks like this with
this nature it&#39;s not protected so in
order to save it we have to know that it
exists at all so let&#39;s move beyond
defining new york city as just taxicabs
the Empire State Building and jay-z all
hardscapes and humans are flora and
fauna and
our own well-being depends on it for the
first time in human history the world is
now an urban place so more people live
in cities than they do in rural areas
this makes the Big Apple a proxy for the
whole planet so this is about more than
just saving the last few spaces that are
left it&#39;s also about opening up cities
to nature from the inside out so here&#39;s
something you&#39;ll recognize a typical
street tree right it&#39;s sad a loner a lot
like our mountain men shoved off to the
side and forgotten but what if we
transform this tree into a natural
community by filling it with native
ferns and shrubs and wildflowers now
imagine if we took plenty of these
communities pack them into shipping
containers and snuck them into times
square in the middle of the night
without getting arrested this pop-up
forest with towering trees and trout
lilies against the flashing Jumbotrons
will help show page the transformative
power of nature nearby but this idea
this time square biome is just the
beginning let&#39;s put these now on every
single block throughout the whole city
these biomes are now habitat for
warblers and vearios and monarchs these
creatures search through our city find
homes and our biomes and help feed our
souls too so we have a choice we can
continue to define New York City as Kurt
Vonnegut&#39;s skyscraper National Park or
more radically by celebrating the
chestnut Oaks back row here the metallic
bees that buzz here and places for all
of us to take all of it in thank you
