the purpose of the Library of Alexandria
was to collect all the world&#39;s knowledge
although we&#39;ll never know exactly how
successful it was I&#39;m certain that the
modern-day version of it is doing a much
better job now you may be thinking that
the modern-day version is the internet
but actually that&#39;s not the case really
the modern-day version is all the bits
of contents that live on millions of
computers all over the world the
internet is merely a pathway to this
distributed archive of information and
in the internet has problems because
these pathways are expensive and you
know the advent of a $35 smartphone in
turn axis in some countries is 10 times
monthly income which is exactly why 4
billion people do not have access to the
Internet now you know you&#39;ve seen the
graphs the global internet usage race
around the world are going up year after
year after year but still 4 billion is a
huge number and it&#39;s a huge problem
which is not going to be solved anytime
soon so let&#39;s dissect the problem and
try to figure out what we can solve so
right over here we have a map that shows
global connectivity and if we view the
the internet as a key to the library
then we see that the key is either too
expensive or does not exist in much of
the world so if we want to be able to
access or offer access to a library of
information to everyone we want to
bypass conventional pathways so how do
we do this well one way is to think
about a pathway that already encompass
isn&#39;t fully blanket the whole world and
that&#39;s radio waves and very specifically
radio waves broadcast radio waves from
satellites I&#39;ve been thinking about this
problem for about seven years ever since
I started library school and in the past
two years I&#39;ve been working on a
solution
oh well and the solution is Oh Outernet
Outernet is a universal information
service available to all of humanity
regardless of income infrastructure or
geography what we do is we take content
from the web and we broadcasted over
satellites we make offline versions of
the web available to those who cannot
have access to the Internet so this
right here is a 60 centimeter dvb
satellite dish it&#39;s common in even the
most remote places of the world they&#39;re
normally used to be able to watch TV
what we repurpose them to be able to
receive our data cast we we use them to
collect pieces of websites and we have
software that reconstructs that data and
turns it into digital files and then
which can then be viewed through a web
browser any kind of a web browser I&#39;ve
mentioned the word beta cast and so one
thing to be very specific about is a
data cast is like a television broadcast
it&#39;s a one-way transmission and so the
way that this works is you know for
example with this screen right here is
if you&#39;re tuning into the galaxy 19 or
hotbird 13 which covers 1.1 billion
people in the world if you&#39;ll see this
and if you happen to have software with
the right compatible hardware is that
your hard drive will begin to be
overflowing with web pages that we&#39;ve
copied and push down the pipes this is a
solar-powered do it yourself digital
library it&#39;s made entirely from
off-the-shelf components this one is
somewhere in Detroit right now it&#39;s
continuously receiving Wikipedia our
current service covers all of north
america europe middle east and north
africa by the end of the year we&#39;ll have
complete global coverage and we&#39;ll be
able to deliver 10 gigabytes of content
per hour i want to give you a little bit
of context on exactly what that is over
a period of just 90 minutes we could
the entirety of the Ted website this is
my favorites this is a pillar of
knowledge it&#39;s basically a village
library but it&#39;s symbolic in that very
shortly will be begin a partnership with
the World Bank and the focus of this
partnership will be the pillar of
knowledge but also the focus of it will
be to provide educational information to
a billion people in the poorest
countries in the world and in the most
fragile states so I&#39;ve talked a lot
about the data casting the service the
application layer but no now we get to
go to the fun stuff right now I&#39;d
mentioned that we&#39;re operating operating
over leases from conventional
geostationary satellites starting next
year will be renting a microsatellite
this is a prize that is actually an
exact replica of price at a price that
is a fully operational microsatellite
it&#39;s currently in a six hundred
kilometer orbit and it talks two
receivers on the ground and and this
this is Lantern Lantern is a mobile data
casting hotspot so when it&#39;s on solar
power it receive signals from a prize
set and then it&#39;s stored it for later
use when it&#39;s on battery power it&#39;s
serve as digital media over Wi-Fi so one
of the benefits to something like this a
mobile receiver is that in times when
terrestrial networks are damaged due to
man-made or natural disasters is this
will always work so in about a year and
about twenty sixteen or so we&#39;re hoping
to launch 12 of these for our own
constellation for a global network for
mobile coverage in many ways this is
very similar to GPS GPS is also a
broadcast data system what the
difference is that we will be able to
receive 100 * information will be able
to receive 5 50 gigabytes per day and
that&#39;s the equivalent of a dozen ebooks
and a thousand news news are
all without the internet so I just want
to share that what we&#39;re building here
is humanity&#39;s Public Library imagine if
there was a library in every village a
library in every home and a library in
every pocket don&#39;t imagine if imagine
when thank you
