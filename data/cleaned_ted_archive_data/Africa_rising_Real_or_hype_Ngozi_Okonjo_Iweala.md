thank you very much Catherine I&#39;m glad
you don&#39;t want my job the average life
for finance ministers is two years it&#39;s
been calculated I thought about how to
grab your attention today with just
sitting here have learned so much and I
decided there are two things one is I
have to transport you from all these
cold arctic things you&#39;ve been looking
at to a very warm fuzzy continent the
second is that I don&#39;t have any props
like my first TED Talks so you actually
have to look at me now I&#39;m just going to
update you on a TED talk I gave in 2007
which was talking about the other Africa
of business opportunities my talk is on
Africa reality or hype Africa rising
reality or hype let me go back first to
the 80s and 90s and the image of Africa
that everyone had and still has a large
extent which is an Africa of conflict
and Africa of disease and Africa of lost
economic opportunities and Africa of aid
an Africa declining economically where
nothing is happening that&#39;s the picture
that everyone and that was the true
picture but the policymakers on the
African continent learned a lot of
lessons from what happened in the 80s
and 90s and in the 2000s launched a
series of reforms that designed to bring
the continent back up on its feet and
I&#39;m here to just update you and say that
a lot of changes have happened since a
lot of these reforms were put in place
first of all on the continent most
countries are now democracies and have
gone through one or two cycles of
Elections conflicts are down and
economic indicators are looking up and
that&#39;s where this Africa rising
phenomenon came out of let&#39;s look at
debt we used to have a debt as a percent
of our gross domestic product of a
hundred percent or more in most
countries today is 32 percent which is
better than what you have in the US and
Europe and most other places thanks to
the good work that was done and forgiven
Africa&#39;s debt in the early in the 2000s
let&#39;s look at inflation we had an
inflation rate on average on the
continent
about 48% and now we are down to about
6% and growth that used to be less than
2% is now about 5.5 and the IMF is even
forecasting 6% foreign direct investment
has gone from 9 billion dollars in the
year 2000 to 50 billion dollars today
and is double the amount of aid going on
the continent 50 percent of our people
of our urban people in our urban areas
now have access to the Internet and
Internet users gone from four million
people in 2002 167 million today thanks
to the mobile phone so that is what is
happening my country nigeria is a good
example of this we&#39;ve been growing at
about 7 percent per annum for the past
decade third of our young people have
access to the internet internet commerce
and other modern things that you take
for granted are really taking hold on
this continent so I just want to say
that there is a reality to what is
happening and that opportunities that
the continent is a continent of
opportunity one third of the population
are now classified as middle class by
the African Development Bank and
investors I realize in this in fact I
want to say that the boat of investment
and opportunity is leaving for the
continent and those investors who don&#39;t
join now and wise up to this will be
left behind but let us just also look so
this is these all the opportunities but
the high part of it that I want to
caution is that there are also
challenges what are these challenges we
have the challenge of inadequate
infrastructure be it for connectivity by
air within the continent ports roads
rail and power most of all inadequate
infrastructure we have rising inequality
with our growth has come inequality so
that the well of people are the ones who
are getting most of the gains and we
have people who are increasingly been
excluded we have the challenge of
unemployment up to a third of our people
of our young people in most of our
countries are unemployed and if we don&#39;t
solve that problem by improving the
quality of growth it would come to haunt
us
the next five to ten years so these are
the challenges that we see but we can
also look at these challenges as
opportunities if there&#39;s an adequate
infrastructure what does it mean it
means there&#39;s room for the private
sector to invest and to partner with
government to improve this if we have
rise in unemployment what does it mean
it means we need to look at the quality
of those sectors where we invest we need
to diversify our economy so that we can
get people working in agriculture and
the housing sector even in the creative
arts these are the opportunities that we
see and so I want to just tell you that
when you see a challenge in equality it
means we have to improve our tax system
so that we can redistribute to those at
the bottom end of the ladder make sure
they&#39;re included so for me even those
challenges represent opportunities for
the continent and I&#39;m here to invite you
to say join us
work with us work with us to take
advantage of all the opportunities to
ensure that Africa remains a continent
that can contribute to this world and
continues rising with the reality of the
world thank you
you
