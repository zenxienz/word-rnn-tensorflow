my name is Terry kucik one and I
represent the African is the association
with the community of ISPs across the
continent from different countries and
I&#39;m going to talk to you briefly about
what everybody is saying the life blood
of the digital economy bandwidth
broadband call it whatever you want to
say but Africa unfortunately pays 40
times what the developed world pays to
connect the Internet
I guess most of you have been seeing
that what you hear in Africa do you food
bills are high the internet is very slow
and this is the reason why should the
poorest be paying more to connect to the
internet now look on the other side
which is Africa and spent about five
hundred million dollars annually
communicating with each other to third
parties that&#39;s not our problem but look
at the other side of it forget about the
capital flight but then the side of it
is that Africans can spend five hundred
million dollars communicating through
third parties so me there&#39;s a lot of
money in Africa when it comes to
communication so my theory is how can we
figure out how these does five hundred
billion dollars we goes out of the
continent to reduce the 30% that we
spend communicating with each other the
problem is that Africans are not
communicating between themselves within
the countries meaning if you said I&#39;m
not an email right now not in Tanzania
because tanzania has an action point but
you go to Playa Burundi send an email
from one ISP to the other it goes to
London and maybe to the US before coming
to Burundi the same person who may be
sitting next to you because you&#39;re on
two different networks why these two
networks not talking so our strategy as
average price to build internal capacity
let&#39;s get the ISPs talking to each other
let&#39;s get the computer I was talking
with in the countries that&#39;s first step
the second step is that we need to get
the countries talking to each other
which is if I make a call to South
Africa right now to go to London and
maybe to Paris back to London before in
South Africa but if I make a call South
Africa she will go straight across the
border to South Africa or maybe to Kenya
in the case of East Africa is changing
because right at megacolon Safaricom or
settle it go straight across the border
so that&#39;s change this progress so
hopefully we can take that 500 million
dollars and build a treasure
infrastructure that is needed
to make communication cheap and until
communication is cheap in Africa we
can&#39;t participate in the digital economy
I mean talk about you know what was just
being discard call centers you need to
bond with you to get a source into
coming to the continent to create a lot
of the business opportunity that&#39;s being
talked about so here&#39;s how we do in
apart from the you know action point I
XPS internet action points which were
building in various countries we
envisage that if we can break Africa
down into these population dead centers
which are 12 of them and sort of build a
rule Network and alongside the building
of the road network also build fiber
connectivity to displaces quickly you
could see through it happening within
Africa and quickly you can see Africa is
talking to each other across borders and
that will change significantly and a
coup and power train so our solution to
the bandwidth problem is we need to
build infrastructure within the country
there&#39;s a lot of infrastructure that
exists for us to talk to the rest of the
world but we need to beautiful show that
in Africa talking to Africans and using
fiber and also combination with wireless
technology which are very cheap now we
can get Africa wired up and we can get
Africa shocking for next to nothing
thank you what what tell me what you
estimate the cost is of doing that what
kind of investments can be needed
well the nice to me I put is I run a
billion dollars so actually two years we
can finance this infrastructure build up
something is a little bigger but I think
that there&#39;s money to pay for it so 1
billion dollars could do that so someone
could please kindly work out there how
150 years of the g8 thing you know and
then and then next thing were isn&#39;t a
lot else works and we could get it going
but we&#39;re doing it this being building
something with the elements of many
different countries there&#39;s some carbon
that&#39;s going on so into what I want to
talk about what what do you believe is
the timetable to get that done what that
is that it will happen well if we give
Africa another ideas but you see this
the problem we&#39;re building this
determined right now is the fact that
the political system doesn&#39;t allow one
country to top the other for example
when I was coming hours care that we now
get a visa
border but I&#39;m an African ash which
enters Tanzania very easily than any
other country in the world if I&#39;m going
to South Africa should be the Edit setup
aboard ship easily then reconvene the
world in the same way so if I&#39;m building
fibre from Kenya she be able to
entertain them more easily
that&#39;s the company cadet I want to do
this but the Kenyan government has
language says no we will not sure what I
like to do it so there&#39;s some relation I
need to go and it will happen I believe
it will happen in this happened all
right
thank you thank you much
