hello tedsters this is actually my third
TED three-minute talk and it&#39;s great to
be able to share my research but you
know being known as the three-minute guy
is not always a good thing
now Ted is all about ideas Worth&#39;s worth
I&#39;ll try that over now Ted is all about
ideas worth spreading but many people
think I could never have an idea worth
spreading I&#39;m not creative or artsy or a
genius well the good news is anyone can
have super ideas and the interesting
thing is that many great ideas come when
people do surprisingly simple things so
let&#39;s look at four simple ways to have
super ideas one is have a problem
because ideas or solutions to everyday
problems Richard Branson told me at a
problem he was stranded in the airport
after his flight to Puerto Rico was
canceled and to solve the problem he got
on the phone called around chartered a
plane sold tickets to the other stranded
passengers and actually ended up making
a profit the light went on I could start
an airline and the idea for Virgin
Atlantic was born
Sam Smith had a problem he was really
heartbroken after his lover left them
and then he thought well to get over it
I&#39;ll write about it the light went on
and the idea for a song called stay with
me was born it went on to win four
Grammy Awards and song of the year so
Sam went from very heartbroken - very
happy
and the idea solved his problem number
two listen because ears are Wi-Fi for
ideas dr. Jean Carruthers was injecting
a patient&#39;s eyelids with Botox to stop
them from to stop muscle spasms and the
patient asked why didn&#39;t you inject my
forehead Jean said you don&#39;t have spasms
there
the patient said I know but every time
you inject my forehead I get this
beautiful untroubled expression gene
listen the light went on and she had the
idea to use Botox to reduce Brown lines
and wrinkles and from that one comment a
whole new Botox treatment came around
that&#39;s now used by millions and valuated
billions number three look around
Richard Feynman was a physicist eating
lunch in the Cornell University
cafeteria and a student stood up and
threw a plate across the room
those crazy students and Richard notices
a plate spun and through the air
the Cornell medallion on the plate
seemed to be spinning faster than the
plate well he went away got an idea
worked out the motion of the mass
particles whatever there and he said
looking in that plate was what one is
Nobel Prize ji look at a plate now all I
see his food he looks at plate and wins
the Nobel Prize so when it comes to
ideas IQ spelled a ye often wins over IQ
as Marilyn Vos savant says and she holds
a Guinness record for highest IQ to
acquire knowledge one must study but to
acquire wisdom one must observe or as
warren buffett says i always believe my
eyes rather than anything else and now
the biggest secret for super ideas could
I have a drumroll please
oh that&#39;s not bad come on one more time
I don&#39;t wait wait here I have to
introduce you okay one more time a
drumroll please whoa now that&#39;s what I
call a drumroll
the important thing is write down your
ideas because if you don&#39;t they&#39;ll fly
away never to return
Larry Page says when I was 23 I suddenly
woke up thinking what if we could
download the whole web and just keep the
links I grab the pen and started
scribbling out the details and Google
was born when a really great dream shows
up grab it so if you are dreaming of a
great idea forget being artsy or
creative or genius just be yourself
do some really simple things and you too
can have super ideas worth sharing and I
can&#39;t wait to hear about them thanks so
much
