okay how many times a day do we check
our phones maybe 20 30 what if I told
you that the average person checks their
phone over a hundred times a day that is
a tremendous amount of time we&#39;re
spending looking at our devices but
what&#39;s the alternative we can either
have our phones out all the time
interrupting us while we&#39;re in meetings
or when we&#39;re out to dinner or we can
keep them tucked away in our handbags
but then there&#39;s this fear of missing
something important now for a lot of the
men in the audience which there aren&#39;t
very many right now you tend to keep
your phones in your pockets but for
women we don&#39;t have pockets that big and
sometimes we don&#39;t have pockets at all
so I started to think about ways where I
could have the most relevant information
sent to me without it being distracting
to what I was doing or who I was with
and since most women I know wear jewelry
I thought that the time was right to
finally put our clothing and our
accessories to work and to have them
help us and do more than just decorate
us I began to see this vision of the
future where our clothing and
accessories will become our devices and
they&#39;ll help make us better and
healthier and more efficient in a few
years time everyone here is gonna be
shopping for electronics the way that
today we shop for clothes you&#39;ll want to
buy the piece that fits your personal
style and you&#39;ll want to buy the
functionality that fits your lifestyle
so you know there are a lot of amazing
products on the market today but a
problem that I saw with a lot of these
products was that they were being built
and sold as unisex offerings and they
tend to look a lot like gadgets I
noticed very few companies in the space
targeting women and even fewer were
focused on the fashion aspect of
wearable technology and you can&#39;t just
turn something pink and think that women
are going to want to wear it
men and women have very different wants
and needs when it comes to our clothing
and we wear different things so let&#39;s
start designing these devices
differently there doesn&#39;t need to be a
one-size-fits-all solution so when I
polled a lot of the women I knew there
were a few things that stood out that
wearables needed to be in order to work
for us one they needed to solve a
problem in our lives too the tech needed
to disappear and exist in the background
three they needed to look good in our
case the jewelry had to be something
that you would want to wear even if
there was no technology inside and
finally they needed to empower us so
that&#39;s why I decided to create an option
for women i designed a collection of
smart jewelry so this ring that I&#39;m
wearing right now is actually connected
to my phone and it will vibrate and
flash a little color depending on what
notifications I&#39;ve set it up to to do so
for example right now I have it set up
to vibrate three times and flash green
when I get a text it vibrates once and
flashes red when I have my next meeting
coming up and it&#39;s not about getting
every notification sent to us we can
filter down to the ones that are most
important so if you only want to know
and the kids or the babysitter is
calling you can set it up that way
alternatively if you want to know every
time someone likes your Instagram posts
your social media posts you can also set
it up that way so let me walk you
through a few of the product decisions
we made to get to this point because
although it looks very simple it came
with a lot of challenges here is a video
of my very first prototype
I purchased a snaffle electronics kit
online and a 3d printed some jewelry and
built this vibrating motor circuit so I
could measure the intensity of the
vibration inside of the ring because the
first thing I wanted to know was does it
even feel good to have your jewelry
vibrate on your finger
and I used this to test it on different
people to get their reaction and the
reactions were incredible I still to
this day get so excited when someone
tries the product on for the first time
there&#39;s just so much surprise and joy in
their reaction and I knew I was on to
something so the next thing we looked at
was making the tech part of wearable
tech feel discreet and a hidden and so
from an engineering design perspective
we really focused on the miniaturization
of all the electronics there are about
50 components in here so we really
worked to get them super super small and
tiny so that we can work with artists
and designers to be able to create
around it without a lot of restrictions
and with that we made the decision not
to have any buttons or switches or
screens or plastic or USB ports we
wanted it to look like jewelry first and
this seems like an obvious thing but it
comes with a lot of challenges for
example if you have no button on your
product how do you turn it on and off
and how do you reset it if something
goes wrong and if there&#39;s no charge for
it how would you charge it so we added a
few key things to its core it has an
accelerometer so while you can&#39;t turn it
off by a button or a switch you can set
it to go into a low-power state when
it&#39;s not being worn or when it&#39;s not
moving and you can also tap on it oops
to get feedback on whether or not it&#39;s
connected I&#39;m all good and then when we
looked at charging we really looked at
how people wore jewelry today so usually
when you go home at night you take off
your jewelry you put it back in your
dresser or back in the box so that&#39;s why
we decided to make the box the charger
you simply just take out the jewelry put
it back at night and voila you&#39;re good
to go and the Box even has a battery
inside so it doesn&#39;t need to be plugged
in all the time
and the next thing we looked at was the
actual jewelry part so we made the
decision to use all semi-precious and
precious hand-cut gemstones and this is
great for our customers but typically in
consumer electronics this is a very
strange thing because not node1 product
looks the same
usually with consumer electronics
everything comes out exactly the same so
this created a level of complexity in
our manufacturing and quality control
you know they&#39;re very frustrated with me
because they don&#39;t know how to tell if
something&#39;s good or not but you know
it&#39;s a very important decision so
looking at these details and you know
thinking through all these design
decisions can really make your product
feel magical so they really should not
be overlooked and now I&#39;ll leave you
with one of my favorite quotes by Mark
Weiser who&#39;s said to be the father of
the ubiquitous computing movement and he
says that the most profound technologies
are those that disappear and I couldn&#39;t
agree with the statement more especially
when it comes to the Internet of Things
and to wearable technology we&#39;re at a
point in time where technology can fit
seamlessly into our environments and
work itself work its way into all the
things that we interact with on a daily
basis like our clothing so the next time
you start a project I always recommend
start with the problem that you&#39;re
trying to solve first but when you look
for solutions just simply look at the
world around you you could be wearing
the answer to all of your problems thank
you
