well you see on the screen are seven
individual atoms atoms of the building
of matter but in my lab atoms of the
building blocks for a quantum computer
so we use the quantum states of these
atoms in order to store and process
information why do we do this well the
computers even the supercomputers that
we have today cannot do every task that
we throw at them here is an example from
chemistry what you see is that as the
size of problem increases the time taken
on a supercomputer increases
exponentially and it rapidly hits the
age of the universe the prediction is
that for a quantum computer the scaling
is very different and it maintains its
ability to compute this type of problem
now these are the problems don&#39;t just
exist in physics in chemistry in fact
one of the first quantum algorithms was
found for finding the prime factors of
very large numbers and that&#39;s important
because that means that a quantum
computer would break RSA cryptography
which is a gold standard and in
widespread use today and while these
problems may seem niche it&#39;s worth
bearing in mind that cryptography and
physics for exactly the areas that were
being thought about by the fathers of
the modern computer with no anticipation
of the major developments that were to
follow so how do we build a quantum
computer well we start from individual
atoms and we start from the quantum
states of individual atoms and those we
think of in the following way we take
the surface of a sphere and each quantum
state is a point on the surface of the
sphere and we donate up as being zero
down as one and quantum states can be
anywhere in between in the laboratory
when we shine a laser pulse what we do
is to rotate this quantum state about
the center of the sphere but for a
computer we don&#39;t you just need these
individual elements we also need to
connect them together logically and so
how do we do that well there we use the
fact that our atoms are charged and that
means that they push on each other they
repel each other like balls on the end
of a spring if I move one the other one
also
moves and this gives a physical
connection and allows us to start to put
together circuits and here the circuit
that you see was one that we use to
demonstrate any logic on two atoms but
two atoms is pretty far from competing
with a supercomputer so we think we&#39;ll
need around a million atoms in order to
do that and that&#39;s very far from the
level of six or seven which are in the
leading laboratories today and the thing
we&#39;re thinking about there is scaling up
and the question you ask is how what do
we need in order to scale up and a
principal element is you need to be able
to communicate you need to be able to
take information from one side of your
processor to somewhere on the other side
and so one of the things we had to put
in was the ability to transport our
atoms around this larger device and
indeed that&#39;s what we do we push them
with electric forces with this in hand
then we had the ingredients for scaling
up we can transport and we can do all
other operations that gives us a unit
which has all the elements we require
for scalability and can be dropped in as
part of a larger array to make a
computer what remains is to fabricate
complex structures that can actually
implement this computer and advances are
being made there too in red I&#39;ve
highlighted the regions where the atoms
can be transported on this chip and all
the other things you see are connections
for control signals and the beauty of
this chip is that it was built using
methods that are similar to the methods
that are used to make the chips in your
laptop so there we have to stand on the
top of the electronics industry which
makes highly complex and well-developed
devices in order to build quantum
computers so where we stand today we
think there is no fundamental barrier to
building a quantum computer for what is
nevertheless required is innovation
technological innovation physics
innovation in order to take us the
optimal path to that goal thanks for
your attention
