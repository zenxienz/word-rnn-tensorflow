I am here to raise the alarm picture a
place where women are seen only
twenty-four percent of the time that&#39;s
what the global news media serves up to
you each day it&#39;s like this just we
Charlie rally picture when a northa when
a when an ultra-orthodox newspaper
removed all the women from the image
news covers women twenty-four percent of
the time here&#39;s how that plays out each
country shrinks can we go back one there
we go each country shrinks by the
percent of the population of women who
are missing from the news it&#39;s not
pretty and when women are seen and heard
we&#39;re all too often shown as objects or
victims this distortion damages everyone
research tells us that we know less and
we feel more hopeless and cynical from
this news distorted news also increases
empathy gaps inequalities and declines
in social health and well-being add
social media to the mex and empathy gaps
can grow because in social media
inhibitions are low and action is easy
so what can be done how about increase
the level of women in News leadership
and let&#39;s cover more women in the news
frizzy
kudos to Bloomberg News who now insists
at least one woman expert is featured in
every Enterprise journalism story and at
PRI we&#39;ve made a serious commitment with
our across women&#39;s lives initiative
these are just two examples of putting
the news back into balance second let&#39;s
continue to push social media companies
to provide tools to combat harassment
and misinformation and third let&#39;s take
action ourselves by spreading newsworthy
stories about women and using social
media to drive change one of my
inspirations is Alana Pierce she&#39;s a 21
year old Australian journalist who
reviews video games she&#39;s been harassed
online including rape threats her
solution she says when these boys do
this to me I go to their online profiles
find their mothers and then tell them
exactly what their son has said to me
it&#39;s 2015 it&#39;s high time that women are
shown as the powerful force we are in
society it&#39;s good for women men and the
world we are done with news
organizations not covering women and
Miss shaping our world let&#39;s band
together hold news organizations and our
social discourse to a higher standard
and let&#39;s create a world that&#39;s more
informed and balanced and values all of
us thank you
[Applause]
