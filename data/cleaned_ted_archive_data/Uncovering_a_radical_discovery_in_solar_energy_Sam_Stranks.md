I hold the future of solar power this is
a piece of glass but on it I have
printed a thin film of a man-made
mineral called perovskite which is the
fastest improving solar technology we&#39;ve
ever seen I&#39;m a physicist at MIT and
most days I can be found sitting in
pitch dark labs using lasers to study
these profs codes I look at how well
they have a slide to energize and
transport electrons as electrical
current and how we could improve the
efficiency of this we&#39;ve made
breakthroughs by looking at these
processes happening on timescales of a
billionth of a second at a length scales
100 the width of a human hair I first
came across prof. Scott&#39;s back in 2012
while I was at Oxford University when a
fellow graduate student made a
remarkable discovery
he found that man-made versions of the
naturally occurring minerals called
perovskite could be tweaked to make
extraordinary solar materials like this
one I hold in my hand
prof. Scott&#39;s let us truly rethink what
we can do with the silicon based solar
panels we see on roofs today we can
create profs cait cells that are
colorful opaque or partly transparent
this means we can make beautiful
buildings in which the solar panels are
an integral part of the design rather
than something that needs to be
disguised imagine a skyscraper with
colorful perovskite tinted windows that
shade the interior from hot sunlight by
converting it to electricity reducing
the cooling bill while also providing
power this is a flexible solar cell made
at MIT that is so light and weight that
it can be suspended on a soap bubble
being that we can envisage lightweight
inexpensive price guard solar sheets
that could be moved with the Sun just
like clothes hanging to dry being so
light they could be easily deployed into
remote communities and this could go a
long way to providing power for the 1.3
billion people in the developing world
who lack access to electricity another
aspect that really excites me is how
cheap these can be made these thin
slang films are made by mixing two
inexpensive readily abundant salts to
make an ink that can be deposited in
many different ways for example by
printing roll-to-roll like newsprint by
gently heating these thin films form
just like salt crystals emerging from
evaporating tidal pools the films are
very high-quality similar to the silicon
we see in solar panels on our roof today
but without the costly high temperature
processing this means that profs gate
solar panels could cost less than half
of their silicon counterparts to put
this in context less than half a cup of
the ink would make enough profit solar
panels to power an average home and a
figure I find even more impressive
prof. Scot solar panels made from just a
half-filled Olympic swimming pool of the
ink would comfortably power all of
California in just three years the
efficiency prof scout solar cells
convert sunlight to electricity has hit
21% and rising that&#39;s a milestone
conventional silicon took 30 years to
reach but prof. scouts are set to reach
the market first as an ally rather than
a competitor to silicon we can even
print a low-cost prop Scot layer right
on top of new silicon panels without any
major changes to manufacturing
installation or wiring this boosts the
efficiency of today&#39;s silicon technology
by generating at least 20% more
electricity per panel but at very low
additional cost when I say that prof.
Scouts are the future of solar I don&#39;t
mean in the distant future prof Scots
are said to make their commercial debut
this time next year the challenge we&#39;re
facing now is the show they can reliably
operate for many years but accelerated
testing shows were on track what&#39;s more
we&#39;re discovering these profs cards also
excellent light emitters and they could
spawn the next generation of low-cost
LEDs with exceptional color purity
that&#39;s a whole other story
we&#39;ve still got work to do and it would
take a global push to realize the full
potential of prof skates but given the
price of cheap clean energy the future
is bright thank you
