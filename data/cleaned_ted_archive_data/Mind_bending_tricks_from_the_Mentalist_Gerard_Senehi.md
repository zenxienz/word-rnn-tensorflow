I know about you guys but I cannot
imagine what the future is gonna look
like in 50 years I may not be alive then
but you guys will and honestly I cannot
imagine what my future is gonna be like
in five years and I&#39;ll tell you why
later but I&#39;ve asked for a few
volunteers to be selected at random so
if you could please come up we&#39;re gonna
have a little fun all right because I
have this unusual job I&#39;m a Mentalist
which really means that I do things that
people don&#39;t know can you line up over
here please and I&#39;m gonna ask two of you
for an object and two of you you&#39;re
gonna send me a word in a foreign
language and oops
alright two of you for an object you&#39;re
gonna send me a word in a foreign
language and you&#39;re gonna think of a
picture could I borrow an object please
I hold it up point it up straight up
like this now how many of you believe in
telekinesis the ability to move things
with the monitor it&#39;s a little one there
all right well I&#39;d say it&#39;s don&#39;t move
don&#39;t move watch don&#39;t hold it too tight
did you feel that all right very good
you have an object to let me stand in
between you two right here hold out your
hand like this we&#39;re gonna take this
hold out your hands be ready to catch it
two hands watch
did you see that amazing the Energy&#39;s
like flowing today
alright so people when they see what I
do they think they know what it is but I
like to do something they&#39;re not sure so
people sometimes think I have psychic
powers which that&#39;s crazy or they think
that I&#39;m doing a magic trick that might
be crazy - who knows all right but
you&#39;re gonna send me a word in another
language you got a mic all right we need
a mic what language Spanish could we
have a handheld all right think of your
word is this something roundish yes I&#39;m
getting that I&#39;m getting like give me a
letter please about a Quaker vowel just
hey does it start with a in English
English yes in English it starts with a
a Apple yes that&#39;s your word yeah
all right fantastic that&#39;s really really
good interesting huh all right now I
don&#39;t know what the future will look
like but if we were living three four
five hundred years ago and you ask
someone your age what&#39;s the world going
to look like in 50 years they would have
said well it&#39;s kind of more or less look
like the way it looks like now so that&#39;s
kind of interesting
all right you have a picture that you&#39;re
thinking of all right I&#39;m gonna ask you
to take one of these and one of these
and in a minute I&#39;m gonna ask you to
draw it but before I do I want to do a
little test with the whole audience here
think of a number between 1 and 50 I&#39;ll
give you a hint it&#39;s an odd number
both digits are odd you&#39;ll have one
I was sending you what do you have 37
that&#39;s what I was sending amazing
alright this is good now we&#39;re ready
alright stand back to back with me right
here
all right I&#39;m gonna draw it first just
think of your image clearly try not to
mess me up because I get confused all
right
I&#39;ve done mine you do yours
what okay all right so I I&#39;ve got to go
now but I want to tell you something
even though I don&#39;t know what the future
will look like in five years for me that
is a really cool things I mean sometimes
I might feel a little bit like unsure
but the reason I love that I don&#39;t know
the future because it means that I can
imagine it and I can create it and I
guarantee you in five years you&#39;ll see
me doing something different so thank
you very much and thank you
I have I have a question for you all
right I have to ask because I&#39;m stunned
what should I be asking you oh my god
that is amazing that is like the best
question uh what&#39;s important in life I
guess I mean if you&#39;re if I have one
question I guess you got asked what&#39;s
important in life
I guess what&#39;s important is to make room
for what&#39;s possible that&#39;s what I&#39;m
saying thank you so much hi
