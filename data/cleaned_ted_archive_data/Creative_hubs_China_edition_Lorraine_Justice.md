put all of your papers away we&#39;re going
to have an exam on your east-west
knowledge of design in China bear with
me we&#39;ve all heard that cringe-worthy
question can the Chinese people be
creative can the Chinese people innovate
well I have to tell you that is one of
the most Western centric ideas that I
have heard in a long time and i&#39;m here
to share with you some of these ideas so
when the Western eye looks at Chinese
art it looks as though nothing happened
for 2,000 years we really don&#39;t
understand what&#39;s going on in the art
the transitions and how narrowly those
people had to innovate and create within
the Confucian system so 2,000 years of
Confucian creativity but were more
comfortable with the last 65 years of
the PRC and they have certainly had
their disruptions in art so when people
ask that question are the Chinese people
creative are they talking about the
disruptive self-expressive creativity
that we have in the West or are they
talking about some other type of
creativity and I can assure you there
are other types of creativity so in the
last 50 years China seemed to take a
great leap forward and go from this to
this this is the work of guap a she&#39;s a
very disruptive fashion designer in
Beijing she shows all over the world and
yes fashion is a feeling but she&#39;s
expert at fantasy and color and so on
and so she is leading the way in one
area fashion design but let&#39;s look in
contrast to the work of Makkah who is
from southern China her clothes
made of natural materials and are very
casual so you&#39;ve got these contrasts
going on just from the north and south
of China the other thing is we as
Westerners have had 200 years or more to
get the nuances of advertising branding
consumer loyalty consumer research and
so on China has really only had about 30
and that&#39;s not even addressing the IP
issues but the 2008 summer olympics in
beijing really brought home
international branding in a big way and
marketing and so the chinese people have
really started to embrace creativity
marketing branding and so on now the
next few slides i have to show you our
of current work going on by
professionals in china i took just a few
and this is the work of nyrian who and
they do old and new works in china
sometimes with new materials and notice
that the sizes are different the colors
and shapes are different and it&#39;s made
from zisha clay dug from the side of a
lake they&#39;ve taken village ladders and
used that shape and gardens tools to
make more modern products the designers
in China today are concerned about large
scale problems and they&#39;re using small
scale solutions this is the lettuce
house and it&#39;s a modular house and it
incorporates grey water and composting
and all of that and there&#39;s a team
that&#39;s working on some of the social
issues around that this is the creative
work of her John ping he takes Chinese
calligraphy and uses a Western format
and we don&#39;t need to understand Chinese
calligraphy to get the feeling and
message from his work so right now in
China they have approximately 1,000
industrial design programs in their
universities
the United States has about 53 and
decreasing this is an image of a work
done by this group of students who also
care deeply about social issues and
economical issues and climate issues and
so on and it&#39;s a face mask that they
hope will one day replace the paper mask
and there&#39;s ongoing work in this area
this is a deceptively simple image of a
shoe there&#39;s a whole system behind it
but it has embedded technology to help
the visually impaired navigate uneven
surfaces but they&#39;re also using some of
the latest materials and technology that
are being developed in china so they&#39;re
not above using ancient buddhist imagery
to to get their point across I took this
example because I thought it was
interesting it was done by a group of
students who were inspired by the
stained glass windows in western
churches and although the format is
Western the images that they&#39;ve created
are certainly not they&#39;re very
contextual and you know we have less is
more in our interface design and so on
we are seeing things in China that are
going more contextual which will
probably mean that we are going to need
more research to really understand the
way some of the interfaces will go on
the products they develop so there are
1.3 billion people in China I&#39;ve just
shown you the work of only 20 to scratch
the surface so I don&#39;t know do you think
China is going to be creative and
innovative I think so
