it&#39;s gonna be a little different than
the last one my father killed people
it&#39;s been 14 years since I discovered
that fact and the second I did it cast a
shadow over my childhood I found John
Mafia&#39;s criminal history on the Internet
when the New York State Department of
Corrections digitized its records in
2000 tons out my father a drug dealer
and a thief
was in prison for 12 years before I was
born for murder
gun murder he shot a criminal informant
in Owls Head Park in Brooklyn in 1963
right before my mother died in 2006 she
confessed that he had committed several
gun murders that he&#39;d never been
arrested for the John Mafia I knew was a
carpet cleaner but even when I was a
child his past intruded in our lives
when I was just a few months old my
father broke his parole and we lived as
fugitives for five years hiding out in
Southern California under fake names the
FBI came for him eventually
and it was quite a scene my cousin kept
me in my bedroom while they questioned
him downstairs and led him off to jail
so she was 16 and a lot stronger than me
I was five I bolted for that bedroom
door determined to say goodbye I
wouldn&#39;t give up I ran to the door again
and again and again and she pulled me
back each time by my hair that&#39;s how
strong our bond was even though my
father was a murderer
he was a good father to me he died in
2001
fast forward to January 2013 right after
the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown
Connecticut Joe Nocera the op-ed
columnist I worked for at the New York
Times asked me to find out who gets shot
every day in America strangely no one
was doing this the project which we
called the gun report began with just a
couple of Google News searches I would
search for man shot woman shot child
shot teen shot accidentally shot I would
gather as much information as I could
find about each story and compile it
into a daily report though it started
out small by the projects and 16 months
later we reported 40 shootings a day of
course there are more not every shooting
makes the news according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention 60%
of all shooting deaths in America are
suicides and most suicides are not
reported at all I didn&#39;t expect everyone
to read it all it&#39;s kind of hard
material to get through I just wanted
them to scroll through and get a sense
of the carnage taking place in their
country every day soon I began to see
patterns shootings multiplied over the
weekend resulting in paragraph after
paragraph holidays summers were the
worst full of needless violence
arguments stray bullets kids finding
their parents guns compiling the weekend
report took me 10 hours but it was like
climbing a mountain every day but it was
important work this is exactly why I
became a journalist would it sway public
opinion or a spark legislative change
probably not but it would start a
conversation about guns between each
mass shooting this drumbeat needed to
continue before and after the Adam
Lanza&#39;s of the world did their damage
believe it or not it wasn&#39;t until I been
doing the report for a few months that I
realized that the daughter of a man who
took lives with guns was now reporting
on gun violence
perhaps this was my penance I could
atone for the lives my father took
people would ask me Jennifer how are you
coping with us this is such depressing
material I became really numb but that
all changed the day I found myself
reporting on a friend ally escandarian
35 was shot and killed by a disturbed
former acquaintance in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn on November 11 2013
along with two of his fellow musicians
they were members of the yellow dogs a
rock group comprised mostly of expats
from Iran Ali was vibrant full of
positive energy nothing but love I was
used to reporting on people I didn&#39;t
know but all these death made it real
before I started this project I had my
own assumptions about gun violence in
America more than 350 posts and 60,000
deaths later here is what I learned
there are a lot of gang shootings and
drive-by shootings and they&#39;re happening
in former hubs of industry now in
economic decline like Indianapolis and
Flint Michigan I was surprised to learn
that certain suburbs were magnets for
gun violence perhaps mirroring the
housing implosion not that the nation&#39;s
cities were exempt Miami Chicago st.
Louis Detroit Newark New Orleans
Philadelphia all well represented the
entire eastern half of California is
rife with gang activity while half the
shootings I reported were the result of
a crime the other half I was very
surprised to learn with a result of
arguments
often fueled by alcohol among neighbors
family members friends romantic partners
many homes in America have easily
accessible guns and children find them
shooting themselves and each other while
we&#39;ve been sitting here a nine-year-old
girl in Newark was shot by her 12 year
old brother who was playing with a
9-millimeter gun in their house happened
just this afternoon she&#39;s in critical
condition a hundred children died in
unintentional shooting deaths in the
year after Newtown that breaks down to
two a week you may think that I have the
solution to the scourge of gun violence
in America well it&#39;s a little complex
for one answer but I do have a few ideas
first of all parents need to lock up
their guns end of story
second of all we&#39;re vetted so much in
society to get a driver&#39;s license you
need several points of ID you need
driving training you take a written test
I think we need more vetting and
training to get a firearm I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s too much to ask especially when you
consider that a gun is an instrument of
death owning one is a grave
responsibility every gun buyer should be
screened regardless of whether you get
your gun at a gun shop a gun show or on
the Internet this is what we call
universal background checks
90% of Americans support universal
background checks but Congress won&#39;t
pass them and some states have no gun
laws at all do you know how gangs in
Chicago get their guns they go next door
to Indiana find people with clean
records who buy a dozen at a time
your state can have super strong gun
laws but it doesn&#39;t matter if you border
a state that doesn&#39;t the number one
supplier of illegal guns to New York is
Virginia last week in Washington State
voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot
initiative to expand background checks
this was a huge victory one that we can
replicate in other states if Congress
refuses to strengthen federal background
check laws let&#39;s go around Congress let
the people decide I don&#39;t expect anyone
to wave a wand and prevent the deaths of
32,000 people every year I think the
answer is gonna lie in a patchwork of
solutions it&#39;s not gonna please
everybody but you know what saving just
one life is better than saving none
thank you
