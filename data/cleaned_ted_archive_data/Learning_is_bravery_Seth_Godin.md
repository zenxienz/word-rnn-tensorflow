so for eight years I I played the
clarinet growing up well actually that&#39;s
not true I took lessons but I&#39;m not sure
I actually played the clarinet I went to
hear Michael Tilson Thomas perform with
a Symphony Orchestra and there was a
clarinetist playing a solo and the first
few notes were the middle C the easiest
note the first note they teach you and I
realize listening to that that I had
never actually played the clarinet
I had never once in my entire life
played a single note that sounded like
that note did but all the years that I
was taking lessons no one sat me down
and said you know what none of this
matters none of the notes and the songs
and all that stuff we keep piling on for
you to do matters if you can&#39;t play a
single note that people actually want to
hear and I spent a lot of time thinking
about why was it part of it was that I
didn&#39;t care enough I didn&#39;t care enough
to put myself into it in a way that
would touch another person and part of
it is the world that we are growing up
in quick little experiment go ahead and
raise your right hand just as high as
you can please okay now please raise it
higher hey what&#39;s that about
I&#39;ll tell you what it&#39;s about what it&#39;s
about is that you learned at the age of
four that teachers and parents and
coaches and bosses would always ask for
a little bit more and so it&#39;s safer to
hold a little bit back it&#39;s safer to
care just a little bit less but now we
live in this world where we get a chance
to dance and to leap and to hack and to
do things that touch other people right
but we&#39;re so eager to add another tweet
and do another thing and put another
thing on the pile cause it&#39;s safer it
gives us a way to protect ourselves now
we make the menu longer instead of
making one dish that people are willing
to cry drive across town to buy and so
we end up with the hacker paradox right
number one we need to care enough to
connect care enough to put ourselves at
risk emotional risk or any other kind of
risk to touch other people and to play
one note that&#39;s worth hearing
but we also have to be brave enough to
ship it before it&#39;s ready because it&#39;s
never ready it&#39;s never the right time
Gutenberg launched the printing press
when fewer than eight percent of the
people in Europe knew how to read Karl
Benz launched the Carwin it was against
the law to drive when there were no
roads sufficient for cars and when of
course there were no gas stations or
all-night drive-through liquor stores
and so the question we have to ask given
the leverage that we&#39;ve been given in
the way our culture is so open to notes
that matters this yeah we&#39;re probably
going to succeed the people in this room
have succeeded beyond most people&#39;s
dreams that&#39;s a given
the question is my friend Celine told me
is not that but will you choose to
matter will you choose to actually make
music thanks a lot
wait you&#39;re not gonna play that note I
don&#39;t know how
