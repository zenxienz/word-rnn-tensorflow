living in working in rural tanzania
after the last decade I&#39;ve had the
incredible opportunity to listen to
thousands of East Africans tell me what
they believe their biggest frustrations
in life are for a population that lives
on one to two dollars a day I was
actually really surprised at what I
heard I thought I was going to hear a
list of all the basics food water
shelter but what I heard was that people
wanted access to modern lifestyle they
wanted all the things that government or
the private sector provide us they
wanted better infrastructure they wanted
roads and particularly they wanted
electricity so it&#39;s when the Sun sets
tonight one out of two Africans are
going to reach out are not going to
reach out and flip on a light switch
instead they&#39;re going to light a wick
combusting kerosene which is jet fuel to
create a dim smoky light to light their
home and ward off darkness really it&#39;s
just crazy the world bank estimates that
a single kerosene lamps in a room for
one evening just an average size room
has the same health impacts of smoking
two packs of cigarettes a day that&#39;s
insane so what this means is the world&#39;s
poorest people are paying more for
inefficient energy and I their house
there has to be a better way there&#39;s a
hundred years after Edison invented the
light bulb and we still have 1.6 billion
people who live without access to modern
electricity so my business partners and
I decided that it&#39;s time to stop looking
down and start looking up
and i&#39;m not i&#39;m not talking about god so
we actually you know you look at Africa
it&#39;s the sunniest place on the planet
why is it that solar technology isn&#39;t
accessible to everyone everywhere so we
won out and started knocking on doors
and we found John no sorry this is John
John lives in Tanzania he had three kids
to study by a kerosene lamp every night
and after a few hours of studying John&#39;s
kids have to close their book because
noxious fumes of kerosene start to burn
their lungs of course John doesn&#39;t want
to create unhealthy living conditions
for his family but what did you do we
talked to many people like John we
talked to many families went to many
doors and what we found was actually
surprising the reason why people do not
trade in the kerosene lamps for solar
panels is a risk someone like John would
have to spend his entire life savings to
go out and purchase and install a solar
system if it wasn&#39;t for financial risk
then what if somebody feels it what if
it breaks who does he know who could fix
it how much is that going to set him
back how much is that going to cost him
so in a place where everything breaks we
haven&#39;t only started to look for an
environment proof solution and not
necessarily technology more of a rugged
off-road version of a business model and
our aha moment really came when we when
we look towards an industry that had
already figured out how to bring an
environment proof solution for mod
modern banking and modern communication
to the same exact gigantic population
that we were looking to serve the cell
phone industry everyone in Tanzania uses
their phone for everything they pay
their bills they sometimes get
education they even get medical advice
it&#39;s literally easier to do it&#39;s
literally easier to pay a bill in the
middle of rural tanzania on a 20 taller
basic cell phone than it is to check
your bank balance on a
six-hundred-dollar smartphone in the
middle of New York City so this this got
us thinking what what if we could figure
out a way to provide make solar
technology accessible in the same way
that the mobile industry had attacked
this problem so we thought about this
approach we thought all right what if
someone like John instead of buying a
kerosene lamp he could go and pay one of
paint agent one of our agents the same
amount to install our solar equipment on
his home and instead of instead of going
to the local shop to buy kerosene he
could then just pop up his prepaid solar
meter every day to get electricity if it
breaks one of our agents can come out
and fix it so with this service someone
like John would get 50 times more light
for less money and less risk so this is
exactly what we did to the northern
Tanzania not Kilimanjaro up here in the
top right and over the last year alone
we&#39;ve installed tens of thousands of
solar systems connecting over 30,000
people with access to a modern lifestyle
and one of the surprising things is that
right here in the middle of this of this
map 300 of those systems were installed
by John as one of our sales agents so
that was really the start of off-grid
electric now we&#39;ve made solar energy
accessible for people just like they pay
for their phones they can pay as you go
top up through mobile phone credit and
one of the biggest lessons that I&#39;ve
learned over the years of working in
what would it be considered a
kid resource environment is that there
are no limited resource environments
perceived limitations are really just a
matter of innovation and logistics so I
I think that it&#39;s also really important
to just mention that you know a lot of
people have looked at this problem as
one that&#39;s best solved by charity but we
believe that that there is a business
opportunity to create sustainable
infrastructure for really moving people
into the future with clean reliable and
cheap energy sources thank you
