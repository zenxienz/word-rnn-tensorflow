let&#39;s imagine that this happens some
kind of global catastrophe a doomsday
event civilization has collapsed
and the vast majority of humanity has
died with some survived let&#39;s say this
TED lecture hall serves as some kind of
hardened bunker and well apartment you
loft at the back you die but the rest of
us survive and we venture outside and
find ourselves in this post-apocalyptic
wasteland what now what would you need
to know not just to survive in the
immediate aftermath but to thrive in the
long-term
could you rebuild a society for yourself
and avoid another Dark Ages could you
navigate some kind of shortcut route for
the most important scientific
discoveries and technologies and so
accelerate the rebooting of civilization
well before we go any further let me be
absolutely clear I do not actually
believe doomsday is upon us I&#39;m not
talking about survivalist skills or how
the world might end but I do think this
notion of the apocalypse and the loss of
all that we take for granted today is a
great thought experiment the ultimate
what-if question as a scientist I wanted
to hold up a mirror to our modern
society and explore all of the behind
the scenes fundamentals of how our world
works and how we progressed through
history so imagine that we do find
ourselves in this world with a rug has
been pulled out from beneath our feet
think of all the things that you rely
upon your day-to-day existence food and
clothes and tools and transports how
much of that do you think you could
actually make or do for yourselves and
small community when civilization is no
longer providing for you well I think a
very neat example of the problems it
would face here are given in an essay by
Leonard read could I pencil now the eye
pencil isn&#39;t some gadget coming out from
Apple it&#39;s a story and it makes the
point that this pencil the simplest
implement or tools of ever likely to use
or interact with in our day-to-day lives
there&#39;s not a single person on the
planet that knows how to make a pencil
no one person because human knowledge is
distributed amongst the entire
population from operating a timber mill
or mining metal ore or refining the fuel
that we use to move things around it
takes many thousands of people to make a
single pencil and this is just a simple
item of our everyday lives
as a society we have an immense
collective capability but we&#39;re
individually ignorant and incapable so
what would you need to know to start
rebuilding a society from scratch and to
relearn everything else that you need
well for this project I research into
everything from making metal and clothes
and reconstructing the calendar or the
printing press or generating electricity
which have all been important in
building our modern world but don&#39;t
really have time in 18 minutes to go
into everything you would need to
rebuild the world from scratch so I&#39;m
going to focus what I think to be the
three most important areas that have
allowed civilization to progress through
history and these have been food fire
and knowledge so starting with food if
you do find yourself in this thought
experiment and a post-apocalyptic
scenario you could scavenge for
leftovers and I worked out than the
supermarket just down the road from
earlier North London
there is not preserved food to keep me
alive for 55 years or 63 years if I were
happy to eat or the can dog food and cat
food as well today we are exceedingly
good at preserving and stockpiling food
but sooner or later if you and future
generations are going to survive you&#39;ve
got to know how to grow food for
yourselves and most importantly each
farm has got to grow not enough for
themselves and their own family but for
several other members of society as well
because these people free from the
fields can then specialize in other
skills carpenters and blacksmiths and
chemists and nurses and it&#39;s this feat
where one person feeds ten others that
enabled civilizations to progress and
develop over time so it&#39;s looking to the
basics of how we&#39;ve done that now today
only about a dozen crops account for
over 80 percent of what we grow and
through the history of civilization the
most important plants have been these
the cereal crops and in particular the
first three he&#39;s gone backwards not
forwards let&#39;s try that again I mean
these the cereal crops and in particular
the first three wheat rice and maize
which was supported all of the
civilizations of Europe Asia and the
Americas and this dominance of cereals
in our diets means that throughout the
history of civilization humanity has
thrived by eating grass no different
from our cows and our sheep cereal crops
evolved as fast-growing species of grass
but we hit a problem the kernel of wheat
is a lovely nugget of nutrition but it&#39;s
hard and indigestion so what we need to
do is break down that grain to release
the nutrition so that our bodies can
absorb it and the most important
inventions of
helped here have been the Roman
waterwheel and the medieval windmill
these are clearly ways of harnessing
natural energy sources to save the
labour of our own muscles and the most
important part is a pair of cylindrical
slabs the mill stones which turn over
each other and grind that grain into
flour this is a relic of Stone Age
technology right in the heart of the
complex mechanisms of the windmill and
we take that flour and we cook it we
bake bread and the heat of the fire
makes the food taste nice but most
importantly helps to break down the food
so that we can absorb it so in a very
real sense the mill stones are like a
technological extension of our own molar
teeth and the oven we use for cooking
bread or the pot for boiling rice I like
an external pre digestive system
humanity doesn&#39;t have the benefit of
four stomachs like a cow so you&#39;ve had
to adopt technology to enable us to
thrive biting fast-growing species of
grass so alongside food fire is another
foundation of society we use fire to
cook our food it&#39;s kill germs and meat
and to keep us warm but civilization
also uses fire to take the base stuff
that we dig out to the ground and
transform it into the most useful
materials and substances of history we
take river mud clay and we bake it into
bricks for building we use fire to get
metal out of rock out of the ore and we
use fire to drive much of the crucial
chemistry that our society today depends
on like making artificial fertilizers
which feed over 2 billion people on the
planet today our modern world is as
reliant upon fire as a Stone Age family
huddled over the campfire
we&#39;ve just hidden it behind the scenes
factories and our power stations
nowadays of course much of this energy
comes from burning fossil fuels coal gas
and oil but if we&#39;re starting over from
scratch we won&#39;t get access to crude oil
now something another energy source
something there&#39;s growing all around us
is trees and for much of history and
it&#39;s been firewood and charcoal which
provided the energy source for society
now what I want to show you is a very
effective use of firewood I&#39;ve got
what&#39;s called a gasifier stove here but
I made myself I had just some old junk
tin cans there&#39;s a outer tin can and an
inner can where I&#39;ve got some newspaper
and just a small handful of twigs which
is gonna light in a second and on the
bottom of the outer can there&#39;s a row of
air holes and also underside of the
inner can so when this is lit it draws
the air up through the fire to keep it
nice and intense I&#39;m just gonna like
that now
although it smokes a little as it first
gets started this will clear in a second
and the unique thing about this gasifier
stove is that they go the smokes just be
stopped and we now have a four foot jet
of flame coming out the top so we get
the camera to come in nice and close so
I&#39;m covering myself in some of that
newspaper coming out as ash I&#39;ve gonna
take off this chimney and being careful
of your eyebrows there and the Ted
camera more importantly you should be
able to see that we&#39;ve got these hot
embers at the bottom of the tin can but
they&#39;re also Jets of flame coming in
from those air holes and what&#39;s
happening is that the wood is breaking
down in the heat of the fire and giving
off lots of gases and vapors and smoke
which is itself combustible and we then
reintroduce oxygen in fact hot gas to
then re combust all of that this is
smokeless when its operating and very
efficient so it&#39;s gonna douse that out
now and that&#39;s ready for clearing thank
you now this is exactly the kind of
appropriate technology that has been
touted around the developing world by
development agencies because it&#39;s simple
to make yourself and it makes the most
efficient use of the firewood that a
family can collect and the fact that
it&#39;s smokeless when it&#39;s up and running
means it&#39;s much healthier for cooking
enclosed cramped conditions and power
stations exist which use that same
gasification process on agricultural
waste and biomass to generate
electricity and provide heating that
principle of baking wood to get it to
drive off vapors has also been crucial
in history if you draw off those vapors
rather than burning them as we do in our
gasifier stove you can collect really
useful substances for yourself like
pitch and turpentine and methanol even
the ashes left behind after harbored
fire are exceedingly useful if you soak
water through them you
extract potash or so - if you burned
seaweed and potash and soda are used in
making everything from soap to paper to
glass so before we used oil it was wood
the provided the fundamental chemistry
for society and today we also use fire
for moving things around we burnt fuel
in our cars and our trucks and what you
really want to be able to avoid in this
post-apocalyptic scenario it&#39;s for your
society to regress to a state like this
we&#39;ve lost mechanization you can&#39;t run
engines anymore and you have to resort
to using your own muscles or hitching up
draft animals like horse and oxen so the
question is how can you keep machinery
going to provide power for you when you
don&#39;t have access to oil well you can
take our gasifier stove and if you scale
up from something the size of a soup can
to something the size of a trash can and
strap it to the back of a car you can
run a car using wood as fuel rather than
oil now this is the gasifier stove that
we&#39;ve got on the back and it draws off
those producer gasses takes them over
the roof of the car down into the engine
where they&#39;re finally allowed to mix
with oxygen and explode usefully to
drive the car now sure this might look
like some kind of crazy steampunk
post-apocalyptic Mad Max contraption but
it works and this isn&#39;t some kind of
Fringe hobby during the oil shortages of
the Second World War there are over a
million gasifier powered cars wood
powered crop wood powered cars across
Europe this is exactly the kind of
technology you could use to stop the
further oppression of your society and
then stop pulling yourself back up by
your own bootstraps
now finally I want to focus much more on
the long-term we&#39;ve talked about how you
can put food in your belly and harness
fire for creating crucial chemistry and
driving machinery for you but there&#39;s
something else just as important how can
you ensure that your society develops
and progresses over generations how do
you generate new knowledge of yourself
and relearn everything else you need
well there&#39;s one invention there&#39;s over
400 years old and it&#39;s been more
important than any other and enabling us
to build the modern world and this
invention is a scientific method now may
sound surprise to you but the way that
we do science today is itself an
invention
it&#39;s like knowledge generation machinery
science isn&#39;t a collection of facts and
figures it&#39;s the way you figure new
things out for yourself and in our
history the Scientific Revolution was
driven and enabled by one particular
substance something which is relatively
strong and also chemically unreactive
and also perfectly transparent and this
substance is blass scientists like
myself need glass to build the tools to
investigate the natural world around us
we use glass to make test tubes you can
see inside to watch what happens in
different chemical reactions use test
tubes to make simple thermometers so you
can measure and understand temperature
and heat and we use glass to manipulate
light itself to make lenses for
telescopes and microscopes for studying
germs and bacteria and infections now
the main ingredients for glass there are
three of them are silica soda or potash
that we saw earlier
and lime and you can get these from sand
seaweed and seashells you can collect
for yourself all of the main ingredients
you need for making glass from this
idyllic Robinson Crusoe beach and what
you do is use fire to get a clay kiln
nice and hot and pop inside your recipe
and the soda though is the melting point
of the silica sand so you can melt it
into a mixture and the lime helps to
stabilize that for a good quality glass
so glass and science have been
instrumental and enabling us to explore
the natural world and understand it and
to build the technologies that we use in
our modern world and modern apocalypse
is hopefully very unlikely I still think
this thought experiment of how you could
go about rebooting civilization is very
informative so if you do ever find
yourself in a post-apocalyptic world
remember this most important truth it is
science that built our modern world and
it&#39;s science you would need to build
again from scratch thank you
yes please come up you&#39;ve made a
terrible mess well thank you for not
setting to come here that set me right
into my place there we go
so I was very taken actually let&#39;s step
forward because we have people coming to
clean up to Hoover up behind you I was
very taken with the with the statin you
gave us that it would take 55 years T
everything in the supermarket please
we&#39;re gonna fall off the front hello um
how did you come up with the number 55
years or 63 good handle food she felt
like I&#39;d rather taught myself so for
this project and I researched into lots
of elements of house civilisation works
but also how the stuff we&#39;ve got already
would provide a grace period you could
scavenge and use like canned food I
talked about and to calculate that
number I went around my local
supermarket in Northland and an angel
and walked on every single aisle and
multiplied up everything all the sustain
all the preserved food that is there and
divided down by the amount you need to
eat per day to survive and I got that
number and also some very very odd looks
people working in the supermarket with
me if I clipboard counting stuff up in
the book on the topic that knowledge and
I feel like there are going to be many
many numbers in that - do you have any
other beautiful numbers you&#39;d like to
share with us
oh so the the other things I looked into
was how long pharmaceuticals would
continue to remain useful if they&#39;re not
being produced anymore
and you want to continue taking
antibiotics for example but the thing
that we set up to me is interesting and
was how long GPS keeps going how long
could you pinpoint in position on the
planet before you had to work out
navigation for yourself because the
satellites aren&#39;t working and it ends up
being pretty quick because though the
GPS satellites will still be up there in
their orbits they require regular
updates for the timing signal which is
how GPS works GPS works by a very
accurate clock and they would start
falling out to synchronicity with each
other so get out your sextant right
thank you so much
