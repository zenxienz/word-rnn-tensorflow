Oh how do you possibly talk after your
teacher but that was the connection that
I didn&#39;t know about soul synchro destiny
we know that yes that it was Joan who
and I suspect that germ came into your
life because you have said that in your
life death and life and the creativity
that came out of great suffering are
inextricably linked to talk about
birthin death you know I didn&#39;t
understand it then and I do understand a
lot more now and I continue to go on the
path to understand it even more as we
all do each one of us is a patient each
one of us is a loved one we all live in
birth and death it&#39;s something none of
us get away with so my story is simple I
started when I was born my father died
at 3 in a car accident and I think that
paved the rest of my life you would
think the easy thing is he was a tailor
and made custom-made suits obviously the
last thing I want to go into his fashion
my mother was in fashion my father was
in fashion and I grew up on 7th Avenue
but it was truly the understanding of
his passing that led to my birth of the
person I would become today but I did
wind up on 7th Avenue designing clothes
and Ann Klein was my first boss now for
those of you knows he was an amazing
sportswear designer and I was this young
kid in Parsons School of Design and just
wanting to sort of make it wanting to
prove myself to Ann but the real truth
was I wanted to be home and be a mom I
wanted to take care of my baby because
coming from a working mother for all of
us who are working mothers you know the
biggest stripe we have
how do we take care of our child and
really give that the love and compassion
that we need but that&#39;s not what the
universe sort of saw for me so I had to
be humble about it and had cancer and in
those days nobody discussing she
wouldn&#39;t even tell me I was pregnant
nine months and is having which nobody
discussed and we had a collection to
birth death simultaneously at the same
time so I said I&#39;m gonna stay home be
with my baby now and take care of my
child because I came from a working
woman and I wanted to be the mom we have
to hire another designer and then they
said well you know you&#39;ve got to stay
here and can&#39;t do this without you so
there I was ten days late gave went into
labor in the office went to the hospital
and is in the hospital we&#39;re both in a
hospital and the collections do so I get
a phone call and said well when are you
coming back to work I said would you
like to know whether had a boy or girl
by the way I had a girl anybody
interested the collection is do in
fashion well I said well I can&#39;t I
called the doctor and I asked the doctor
when I can come back to work and he said
you know you know the stitches I said
well I can take care of that don&#39;t worry
but I gotta get to work I have a
collection too they bring the entire
collection to my home and in Long Island
all the trucks the cars and everything
and I get a phone call and died and I
thought everybody was gonna come to my
house to see my daughter have bagels and
lox and celebrate the birth of my new
baby Gabby who was named after my father
but that&#39;s not how it worked out so I
had to go back to work the next day and
do a collection for Anne Klein and you
were very young at the time 25 at that
time the minute that collection came out
and you were suddenly the face of and
the designer of Anne Klein everything
began to change
and pretty soon you found yourself as
that woman who everybody thought had
everything you launched Donna Karen
being you created this global Empire of
design you met the man that became there
so made your partner everything is
looking really terrific in your life and
you say no something&#39;s missing what was
it actually the girl who&#39;s sitting here
will there&#39;s a girl here in the audience
who juiced me the first time
Pam Troy but there I was I had just
opened my own company Donna Karen I had
birthday incline inclined to and I now
had to go on to Donna Karen but I wanted
to design clothes for me and my friends
it was really clear a small little
company just for us didn&#39;t work out that
way and then my daughter had to design
clothes my daughter DKNY the whole nine
yards I had everything I had the most
amazing husband that I had a crush on
since I was 18 years old the man of my
dreams artists creative long hair
ponytail kind of artist guy the kind of
guy I like brilliant he talked about
this thing called connection of the dots
so over my head but he used to put the
dots on the piece of paper he was an
artist and I had a family it was really
beautiful but something was missing I
was a yogi since I was 18 years old
that&#39;s how I did the bodysuit because I
think you put on your body clothes in
the morning you do your yoga practice
and then you go to work so I was very
selfish and designed my own wardrobe but
I was looking I was searching and I went
to the beach one day we have this
amazing house on the beach I had a beach
I had my children I had everything and I
looked at this rock and it was a little
rock on the beach it had two eyes that
look like a big potato will smile into
us and every week I would come back to
this rock and I would talk to this rock
and I would say rock how are you so
peaceful where were you finding your
peace and this amazing
world we live in today and every weekend
I&#39;d come back and talk to my rock and I
would you send to my yoga practice and
everything like that and I was searching
and then in seven weeks my rock
disappeared I got very upset and I
scorned the beach everywhere looking for
my rock so now I decided I&#39;d get a
boulder
so we&#39;d sit on the boulder and talk to
my mother my father had died and I must
say forgot my mother died the day of a
show again birth and death I had a
collection do I had to run to the
hospital take you say mom don&#39;t go
anywhere I have a show to do and then
and then to is you have this
transformative meditative experience
going as Stephen gets sick critically
sick and once again your life shifts and
out of his illness came another
transformation this illness and eventual
death when Steven got ill I thought I
can handle birth and death pretty
quickly but this was when I really
couldn&#39;t handle and it was not only I as
a loved one couldn&#39;t handle but in my
opinion the doctors couldn&#39;t handle and
the nurses couldn&#39;t handle and he
painted a sign for me a plus and a minus
and he laid in bed and I would cry like
a baby because my man and my dreams and
he says listen you can look at the glass
half empty or half full that&#39;s your
choice I&#39;m here why are you crying
but then Steven did pass away and in his
passing I didn&#39;t have the skills then
Joan that I needed now roshi
that how do you really take care of the
patient Steven had this wonderful woman
that both Eve and I know quite well
right now and she took care of my
husband she would walk through the
hospital with these amazing essential
oils and everybody would go what&#39;s going
on what&#39;s going on I want that I want
that and I realized the nurses was so
busy and the doctors were so busy and he
said whatever you do you must take care
of the nurses and I didn&#39;t understand
what he was saying at that time and
unfortunately Steve
past it was about a nine year battle
with cancer lung cancer now my
girlfriend got sick brilliant
photographer artist fashion model brain
tumor a breast tumor I mean they&#39;ll full
nine yards and once again I had to give
her somebody to help her and I had this
vision years ago about where do we find
the calm in the chaos Urban Zen to Dan
Klein inclined to Donna Kerr and I knew
Urban Zen was what I really wanted to do
I needed to address people not dress
them only because they was taken in this
dressing room so often and realizing
what was missing on their inside how do
we get together we&#39;re all here how do we
connect collaborate communicate and
create change
so urban Zen was born the dots were
connected in Stevens studio okay one
more dot to connect what is this a
broken arm
okay first I wish you can see all mice
we don&#39;t have got a lot of okay but tell
me okay I broke my arm
so I said to Pat how do I end on the
rock story but I&#39;d tell you my rock
story I just came back from Australia
and there I was taken to a cave the
burial ground with all sorts of bones
and I was in a nomadic country out in
the wilderness what we do in a turban
Zenoss preservation of culture health
care and education kind of put it all
together so out there I said to the
elder may I touch this bone and they
picked up the bone and I walked out of
the cave and I broke my arm
but the story continues of the
connection of the dots as they broke my
arm
I met a healer an amazing healer I was
on this nomadic project working with the
aborigine culture and he and I had gone
to a hospital where we were doing the
Urban&#39;s and integrative therapist
program I meet this amazing heal he says
come south with me and he takes me south
he says I want to take you on a journey
and I arrive in nowhere as land I arrive
in the most extraordinary place in
Australia and a man gets into the car
his name is Steve long-haired kind of
guy really hot this does not end in a
new romance no no no he has cancer
devastatingly cancer and he said to me I
make fragrance I said really
so does my husband Oh decided my husband
he had cancer he made fragrance and he
said I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re ready for
this
and I said what and he pulled out the
two bottles of fragrance that was first
designed by my husband 10 years ago and
I said he created the first content of
the fragrance we did but Donna Karan
fragrance which Steve created so I so
believe in the connection of the dots in
birth and death there is no separation I
love it yeah your connections for them
[Applause]
