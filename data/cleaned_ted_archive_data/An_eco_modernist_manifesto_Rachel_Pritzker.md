what does it mean to be green most of us
associate being environmentally friendly
with things like recycling driving
hybrid cars and consuming less that&#39;s
certainly how I used to think I was
raised on a goat farm where we grew our
own vegetables and heated with wood in
my 20s inspired by a deep love of nature
I built an off-grid house out of
recycled materials I was committed to
helping the planet but I came to realize
that none of the eco conscious actions
I&#39;ve mentioned even if we all did them
would be enough to solve the great
environmental challenges of our time we
need a different approach so I joined 17
other environmental philanthropists
scholars and scientists in co-authoring
an eco modernist manifesto it lays out a
new vision of how to protect the
environment while ensuring people across
the planet can live fulfilling lives
Eco modernism is optimistic about
humanity and our planets future rather
than encouraging people to scale back
their lives we seek to unleash human
creativity for the benefit of people and
the environment
that means we&#39;re firm believers in
modernity and technological progress
sure it&#39;s fun to fantasize about simpler
lives but not for the billions of people
around the world in dire poverty whose
lives of hardship are not a choice they
deserve access to the same modern
advancements that have brought us clean
water safe medical treatment and well
lit schools the Eco modernist manifesto
argues that for all people to have the
opportunity to enjoy modern living
standards without destroying the natural
world we need to move our civilization
beyond a dependence on natural resources
so how do we do that exactly
well first off we need people to
continue moving to cities because they
concentrate human populations cities and
suburbs only take up about three percent
of the Earth&#39;s land area leaving more of
it to nature since people in cities
don&#39;t grow all their own food urban
migration also drives increases in farm
productivity resulting in more food
being grown on less land cities can be
dirty and isolating but they also give
people especially women important
opportunities to improve their lives for
everyone to have the chance to join the
modern world we&#39;re going to need a lot
more energy to meet this demand without
overheating the planet we need to
rapidly transition to energy sources
that are clean cheap and dense wind and
solar will be part of the mix but they
won&#39;t be enough on their own like all
energy technologies they have some
serious downsides they&#39;re the opposite
of dense requiring huge amounts of land
and natural resources and because
they&#39;re not always on it would be
difficult and expensive for them to
power a modern grid nuclear energy on
the other hand provides 24/7 power and
has a proven track record of being able
to quickly scale up to power a modern
society it&#39;s so dense that a piece of
uranium the size of my fist could
provide all the power I&#39;d need for the
rest of my life it may be an
uncomfortable truth but nuclear holds
enormous potential for both the
environment and human civilization I
know the concerns safety waste and cost
but after overcoming my own assumptions
about them I&#39;ve learned these issues are
not as insurmountable as most people
think
plus dozens of promising new advanced
atomic designs are currently under
development that cannot meltdown can
actually run on today&#39;s nuclear waste
and now for the potential of being even
cheaper and faster to scale I believe
that human prosperity and an
ecologically vibrant planet are not only
possible but inseparable that&#39;s the
essential message of eco modernism it&#39;s
a cause for optimism and it&#39;s already
underway
people are moving to cities we&#39;re
getting more food from less land and
we&#39;re using denser forms of energy by
embracing and accelerating these trends
rather than fighting them we can create
the kind of world we&#39;d all want to live
in and redefine what it means to be
green thank you
