so over the course of the last 23 years
I seek him navigate the planet once on
foot and then I&#39;ll stop counting on this
process I&#39;ve been using 23 pair or
walking boots but I have to say I didn&#39;t
become an explorer I was born an
explorer like everybody here in this
room because as a child we are born to
explore but I guess I always been a big
fan of my inner child why we&#39;ve got
these things coming on here we are so
from there and never stop exploring
across the u.s. I walk around Australia
on a 14,000 kilometers journey I follow
of the Indies in South America all the
way to Machu Picchu and then I walk from
Siberia to Australia under three years
your name in this trip I had this for
the first six month I was in this
cleaning process I was like inside a
washing machine but one day I just look
like another day but that they are
Walker and something happened what was
outside was actually inside me that day
it&#39;s when nature and I became one so
during that trip across Mongolia where
big Mongolian men invade my camp every
night when night falls
then comes China China
was full of surprise put it that way
things get a bit sour when I get to the
western border where the Special Forces
following me there
I needed to flee the country and then
comes allow the hose full on I had
dengue fever for three days in a jungle
alone and a week later while drug
trafficker even my camp at night with
automatic gun so Thailand came like as a
relief crew really because it&#39;s helped
me to appreciate human being again
in fact when I reach South Island I
thought oh my god I&#39;m alive that was
about it
I&#39;d jump in a cargo boat to just get in
Australia where I reach my destination
my little tree down the south part so
these were my previous expedition but I
want to take you today in a northern
part of Australia where there is more
while of the human being this is a
special place because there is
crocodiles everywhere and every time you
try to look through the high grass or
bit more closely you find that list eggs
so today I want to have you drop you
there this is the Kimberley region this
is the most austell place in this
continent
so this is the plan my idea was to
survive for three months with no food
and it was really like the plan of the
average people where to live before his
years ago so I make my way way down and
gets to the bangles bangles national
park but one day I arrive there one
month prior departure and through some
different contacts I made this local
object woman called Jeju I had a chance
to go bush with her and when I explained
to Georgia where I was going to go and
she said to me oh darling no not this
year it&#39;s not a good year this year come
back next year
so she explained it to me that this year
was a drought year and so what&#39;s
happening the bush it&#39;s nature all bark
a wait for the next rainy seasons that
it would be not enough stable food out
there for me to survive on so I did a
seven days walk but she was right so I
decided took to take with me on my
journey a food source of entred gram of
flour per day and this is look like this
that&#39;s all I&#39;ve changed on my original
plan so the expedition started on the
6th of June 2015 I can drop off with a
helicopter and I started walking on the
second day from this higher ground up
there i trow my for debit bucket in a
water trap but i didn&#39;t collect enough
water so i trade again i put it back
when I&#39;m about to pull it back something
was blocking it I thought first well
that&#39;s a branch no worries
you know but the branch was bringing me
my bucket back really hard
I was pretty that way
in fact I was fighting with a crocodile
that was my first fight that was the
real winning beginning of this
expedition can you see this little light
out there right there
this is me it&#39;s my camp
so in order to be strong I needed to
understand my vulnerability and as long
as I&#39;ve been thinking about doing this
trip it&#39;s been a long time it was an old
dream but one day last year I had this
incredible feeling and I thought how
could actually be ready for this dream
of mine hiding in a corner so I started
training studying about it eating a
little did I know then this expedition
would become the hardest expedition I
have ever undertake so it&#39;s a little bit
like you know when you look through
window and you look outside but you
inside a house in order to experience
the outside you have to do that step
outside of the house and you need to go
outside of your comfort zone and in that
little step there is nobody to help you
it&#39;s between you and you but one thing
will help you it&#39;s curiosity curiosity
will help you to open your vision to see
further
it&#39;s how walking became a master over
the years I start to hear the melody of
the earth the more our walk the more it
becomes really clear that everything is
linked it&#39;s like in a big giant painting
where everybody small thing big things
have their place and I start to feel my
sense of belonging to this planet I&#39;ve
crossed deserts Mountain savanna plain
jungle rivers and I started to feel the
belonging with God with this planet
but I needed to understand that we are
part of the mumbles family in order to
survive I need to shut down my left
brain and use the right one
attrition senses feeling and so I needed
to get in touch with my animality a
little bit so it&#39;s a process so over the
years I can now smell the water from far
away I can actually gather my own food
find the right shelter yes I began amid
wild a little bit but deep down on the
Ordos layer we all have I found this one
beautiful animal but let me bring you
back to Australia out there into
all-you-can-eat country you need to find
it first
so in the morning I will eat cup of
flour and then ten hours later even if I
catch one or two fish I still have to
clean it make a fire cook it eat it and
all that energy will not be replaced by
one or two fish
at the beginning of my expedition I will
catch one fish also happy about it
oh I had my first fish getting out of
the water and soon as he get just out of
the water
guess what the Crocs get it so I needed
to put some strategy on place real
strategy for real solution you know so I
will have two different fishing spots
and quietly run from one to the next one
and I will have just enough time in my
hand to actually catch another fish and
make sure that it landed safely next to
my feet soon as yourself they would be
there watching me smiling at me they
become my friend my pet friend so during
this expedition I push at my limit like
never before but I was okay I was okay
but suddenly down down the track one
night for no reason I will struggle I
will hit some boundaries within myself
but then over the years I&#39;ve learned
I&#39;ve learned those hard time don&#39;t last
to start with and storm pass nothing
really lasts so that&#39;s what give me the
power to to strudels house our time and
I was the solution for me because people
asked me how you can actually walk for
so many days so many kilometres
I bet you you on me just one step at a
time
really but every step is important
so I had this trick for my mind you know
what the body is something but you&#39;ve
got the mind to deal with so to trick my
mind I will have like a post-it on my
forehead with my destination writing in
it then I will trick my mind the
destination is here so I will avoid some
question like actually do we know where
we going on this one I had it are we
there yet so now I know that many of you
got one question in mind why why I put
myself to this massive effort pain risk
solitude while in reality there is no
proper answer to this question exploring
is my way to search to understand
walking is my teacher but the best way
to put this is probably to tell you what
surviving for three months has done to
me
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve wrote in my tent the
truth is surviving has ripped me apart
destroy all my self-knowledge and all my
certainties surviving has gutted mean
surviving has run like a ball to my soul
and play with my body fat surviving has
pushed me a little further on further
again into a dark place or sometimes in
an incredible and lighting one either
one of those places I wouldn&#39;t have
visited normally it&#39;s only out of those
zone of extreme encount faults that the
work is done
experiences learn and it&#39;s all worth it
it has always fascinated me to carry 30
kilogram house on my back it&#39;s
fascinating to think that it&#39;s the
reflection of how little we really need
surviving in those extreme places it&#39;s
like buying your ticket to freedom
but the currency it&#39;s sweat hard work
dedication it&#39;s a constant work it&#39;s a
humbling road where the respect for
whole life form grows with the deep
understanding of our invisible link to
everything everyone everywhere
Thank You Sara
so I sure that people here are curious
to learn how you deal with Mongolian man
and drug dealers come into your camp
yeah that&#39;s a bit of a tricky one but
it&#39;s about energy yes so when you&#39;ve got
people coming towards you energy and
into your zone off of security you know
that they up to no good
right they really up to no good so you
need to react in consequence so I&#39;ve got
a big knife and I survived nearly 30
kilos a big knife Sarah thank you very
much thank you
you
