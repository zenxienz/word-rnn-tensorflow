remember the Garden of Eden
for Yves funk out with that snake you
could walk down the street now war about
leaves all the kids could go
trick-or-treating
then those foreigners started coming in
like the Germans in 1790 then the Irish
arrived the potato blight the
neighborhood started changing life was
better we lived right that life had up
a shade of white when they say we want
our America back our America back our
America back when they say we want our
America fair well what do they mean
it&#39;s a classy joint so they told me not
to curse but when the chorus comes
around next time when you guys think it
before that was Ellis Island and that
statue we got from the French well that
horse still learning with strangers
she&#39;s flirting fighting them into a bed
the guineas the coolies the wetbacks
arete the Jews now those terrorists and
you let him know woman looks after my
kids as the one who is cleaning my mess
life was righteous life was clean send
them all back including me when they say
we want our America back our America

want our America back well what do they
mean
before the gays had the agenda before
the slaves were free before that man
