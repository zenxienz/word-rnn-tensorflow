my name is Paulson sale I served as the
executive secretary of South Africa&#39;s
Truth and Reconciliation Commission
Commission was appointed by Nelson
Mandela and Archbishop Tutu headed up
the truth commission and tell you one
story and leave you with one concept one
of the first victims who appeared before
the truth commission was a woman by the
name of Joyce entombed Kulu Joyce&#39;s
Sansa P where had been poisoned while he
was held in detention by the South
African security police he went in
healthy and robust he came out of
detention having lost his hair unable to
walk in a wheelchair and in a generally
Moorabbin estate superior within a
hospital I checked in for treatment and
one night he disappeared
Joyce came to the truth commission to
tell the story of a mother whose child
has disappeared she told us that every
time the phone rang every time there
were footsteps in the corridor every
time there was a knock on the door she
thought it might be superior but she
knew in her heart of hearts that he had
died at one critical moment Joyce
reached down and gathered up a clump of
superiors hair that she had kept since
the day he disappeared and held it above
her head and said this is all I have
left of my son and she said to
Archbishop Tutu and by extension to all
of South Africa I want you to find out
what happened to my son we found out
what happened to Sir P where he had been
abducted in the night by a hit squad
he&#39;d been murdered his body had been
thrown onto a pyre burnt into ashes and
his ashes had been thrown into a river
and the remarkable thing about Joyce and
some Kulu is and and many of the 24,000
victims who appeared before the truth
commission is they fundamentally wanted
two things they wanted the truth about
what happened so they could look back in
order to move forward and they wanted
acknowledgment they wanted somebody in a
position of power to look at them and
say an unspeakable atrocities was
visited upon you and we in the name of
the new South Africa beg for your
forgiveness and now the concept ubuntu a
quintessentially African
term but also a kid term Ubuntu means we
are who we are through our connectedness
with others we measure ourselves not by
who we are as individuals but by who we
are as part of the community and our
contribution to the community and our
obligations to each other
so when you think about mass atrocity
think about a bun tube because Ubuntu is
not about revenge it&#39;s not about
recrimination it&#39;s about building a
community and forcing people back
together in the context of mass atrocity
and when you think about Africa don&#39;t
think about genocide don&#39;t think about
mass atrocities think of one of Africa&#39;s
most important and inspiring exports
think about a good news story from
Africa think about a bunch oh thank
