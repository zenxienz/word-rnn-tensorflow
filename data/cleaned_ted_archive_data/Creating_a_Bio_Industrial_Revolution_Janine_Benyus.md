so here&#39;s what I believe I believe our
species is about to take an evolutionary
leap in culture and this time I think
it&#39;s about the way we&#39;re going to make
things you know those manufacturing
plants on the edge of town with the
razor wire around them and a lights on
all night long
parts of that manufacturing are coming
into the city they&#39;re coming to your
neighborhood they&#39;re going to come into
your house and people are calling this
our generations Industrial Revolution
it&#39;s our Gutenberg press our assembly
line our transistor and I agree I think
that the ability for anyone to make
anything anywhere on demand to make an
object it&#39;s going to have a big impact I
have a question as a biologist if it&#39;s
going to be more benign than less
industrial revolution is it going to be
beneficial to all life is it going to be
biologically compatible this industrial
revolution is coming towards us and this
time we can see it and we have a choice
we can make we can use the metaphors of
the rusty machine age or we can consult
biological wisdom and if we choose the
latter
we are in luck because we are surrounded
by biological wisdom we are not the
first to manufacture put yourself here
when I walk through a place like this
I think manufacturing zone there are
tens of thousands of tons of material
and chemicals being made every instant
without a plume of pollution it&#39;s silent
its fragrant there are no need for razor
water or hard hats or ear guards skulls
and crossbones in this zone
and when I crunch through these leads I
don&#39;t see refuse
I see the raw materials of the next
life-form
I see supply chain the Japanese have a
name for walking through places like
this they call it forest bathing can we
bathe in our manufacturing zones I think
we can but we have to get some first
principles down what is it about those
places what is it about this world that
makes it work first of all what&#39;s
abundant is golden for us what&#39;s rare
the rare earths the gold it&#39;s gold but
that&#39;s what&#39;s precious metals what
abundant is gold and true abundance is
needing what it is that&#39;s right around
you mystery is built to shape there&#39;s no
waste leftover it&#39;s not cut down you
know with waste from from bolt of wood
it&#39;s one material safe chemistry and
reincarnated logs don&#39;t decompose into
the soil of the way they think they do
they upcycle into the bodies they
reincarnate so that the law becomes
fungus and the materials in the fungus
become Bowl and the materials in the
bowl become the spectacular great gray
owl it&#39;s local it&#39;s safe its cyclic its
existence proves that it can be done but
this is our revolution so first of all
we have to really look at the two
stories of stuff because we chose a
different path for sure 3.8 billion
years ago that&#39;s high Anna bacteria came
up and began the first making revolution
right we only been at this industrial
revolution for about 250 years it&#39;s much
older life chose life friendly chemistry
that terrible does not put his head in a
kiln to make that ceramic and yet in a
few weeks a tough tough ceramic is
created we use a lot of high heats a lot
of pressure
chemicals that&#39;s why we need razor-wire
life is additive this term additive
manufacturing life builds to shape we
tend to cut things down so in a
manufacturing parts catalog the biggest
part is for cutting and grinding tools
because we carve things down
96% wastes 4% product we use all the
elements in the periodic table because
we can life uses a safe subset in fact
most materials on this planet are made
with six elements and when those
elements are put into materials into
polymers what are like our plastics long
chains those polymer systems there&#39;s
only about five of them keratin collagen
chitin not very many we use every time
we need a new function we make a new
plastic we have about 350 and Counting
that makes it hard to recycle so they
wind up dispersed all over the place
like plastic swirling in the ocean gyres
life concentrates materials doesn&#39;t
disperse them these are deep patterns
what happens is I bought one material
system that tightened composite that
that beetle is made of has all the
functionality it needs what it does is
it adds information to matter it has
structure to matter so that when the
beetle wants it to be abrasion resistant
it lays up the chitin fibrils in a
plywood hatch when it wants
breathability it makes a poor when it
wants color it puts down transparent
layers that play with light to create
color we do like having layers in our
chip bags in our candy bags you&#39;ll
oxygen exclusion one layer inking
another layer and then it&#39;s hard to
recycle but the story of stuff that we
have we made it up you know nature keeps
what works ancient organism the shock
but it changes what doesn&#39;t have another
eye
since the jumping spider right it
changes by adapting and evolving so
here&#39;s the question can we evolve the
story of stuff it&#39;s starting look at
this we&#39;re not cutting it down anymore
we&#39;re building to shape layer by layer
that&#39;s as close to biomimetic as I&#39;ve
seen
it&#39;s an enabling technology the DNA is
in the computer-aided design the digital
blueprints we can put complexity inside
this is a venus flower basket it&#39;s a
glass made of silica a glass sponge
incredible intricacy but now we can do
that kind of intricacy too we can build
to shape there aren&#39;t the holes that we
poked out of those guitars we can build
a whole car to shape one material in
these shoes the structure changes to
grant function does that sound familiar
when you go to your famous footwear
you&#39;re not going to have thousands of
boxes of shoes you&#39;re going to have five
printers and a new generation of
artisans this is nervous system stuff
it&#39;s beautiful the algorithms come from
leaf venation
designs are going to cross crisscross
the globe in life runs on information
and we do too it&#39;s getting cheaper and
cheaper very high-resolution printer the
form one and even some toys things 400
bucks so here&#39;s my house I want a 3d
printer really badly manufacturing is
coming home but I&#39;m wondering who&#39;s
going to take out my hazardous waste
trash this is our revolution we all have
to do this you guys so with biomimicry
the work that I&#39;m in we look to the
natural world and say how can nature
intervene in the system and you can
intervene in every single one of these
things if you&#39;re an entrepreneur if you
want to start a new business if you&#39;re a
teacher let&#39;s do this supply chain build
files those are the 3d computer-aided
design files that go in the printer it
chemistry in the printer and then the
return logistics so look at biomimicry
is doing so far in this simplified
supply chain remember those five polymer
systems you know we have a lot of right
now
carbon dioxide these plants that these
ants are carrying they are fifty percent
by weight carbon dioxide we have a lot
of that right now so local raw material
carbon dioxide this is Nova mer they&#39;re
making plastics that are 50 percent by
weight carbon dioxide Unilever just
invested in them they learned it from
plants ceramics from waste co2 this is a
sea urchin that&#39;s teaching us how to
pull the co2 out of smokestacks to make
ceramics because you use those in 3d
printing as well our waste cellulose our
papers when you recycle them the fibers
get shorter and shorter and we finally
landfill them there&#39;s a group in Sweden
that&#39;s learning how to take those tiny
fibers and put them back together the
way at rebuild cellulose elegant
structure there are no dyes in this
picture it&#39;s all structural color and
now that we can lay down the layer by
layer let&#39;s make the color come from the
layers that we dial in the group in
Harvard they&#39;re making they&#39;re taking
actually the chitin which is in seafood
waste and they use the architecture from
the dragonflies wing and they layer it
up in that plywood hatch I talked about
and it&#39;s the strength of aluminum with
half the weight and it&#39;s biodegradable
LEDs fireflies have LED lanterns in a
way right and in order to make them
really really bright they put those
tiles inside the lantern when we put the
money LEDs that same pattern we get 55%
more light from the LEDs like friendly
chemistry life use water as a solvent we
use toxic solvents imagine pouring water
into your printer instead there&#39;s a
whole bunch of people working on
water-based chemistry
hold on right now I checked this
morning self-assembly which is putting
molecules together and allowing them to
jigsaw naturally without any heat it&#39;s
called self-assembly there are 308 books
on Amazon with self-assembly in the
title this is quite a mature research
project this is really cool a group in
Sweden again you lot they are doing
surface based chemistry it&#39;s inspired by
the ribosome the thing that makes the
proteins in your body and it puts amino
acid after amino acid using DNA as the
template they&#39;re doing thin film surface
chemistry to basically grow molecules in
your printer not yet
and then the product should come back
right as it does in the natural world
life is really good at this so there&#39;s a
bunch of people biologists who study
molting and who studies the shedding of
skin it&#39;s timed degradation here&#39;s John
Warner and he&#39;s making polymers again
plastics were the raw materials the
building blocks have little molecular
hooks on them you shine UV light they
come together for as long as the
products needed and then when it&#39;s not
needed you put it in an enzyme bath
shine UV light again they come apart
life&#39;s chemistry czar unzip all this is
based on what happens in your body when
you get a sunburn and then an enzyme
comes in and repairs it how do we make
sure John John have a medicinal chemist
but not everybody knows these patterns
so how do we make sure that nature&#39;s
wisdom is available to all makers at the
moment of creation don&#39;t you love this
guy we need a biological intelligence
service bis we&#39;re starting this is
called ask nature org check it out you
can put a function and design an
engineering function in there and up
local nature strategies but it needs to
be much more robust for this makers
culture I want you to join this it is
it&#39;s a wiki it&#39;s a public domain
self-fulfilling prophecy
what we want to do is have people be
able to quickly understand the
biological strategy get the design
principle an application idea and then
download a 3d model that goes right into
the tools they use every day those
computed aided computer-aided design
tools but first we have to scan the
biological world there&#39;s only 140
Natural History Museum&#39;s let&#39;s have scan
genes going there with our cell phones
pull out the drawers
and scan some of these natural models
and then put them in 3d so they&#39;re
available downloadable an architect&#39;s
not going to read a paper on how nature
handles compressive strengths we have to
put that intelligence in a truss if
they&#39;re building a building that they
can download we need to put the LED
light the pattern from that firefly in
our computer-aided design
okay we need optimization tools this is
one that&#39;s based on bones and how they
how your bone responds to stress and
light weights everything else except
exactly where it&#39;s needed and now that
algorithm is used to lightweight parts
we need those right in the right in the
printer files we need a chemistry
recommendation and him so that when you
go to make a toxic reaction in your
printer chemistry you&#39;ve got some
alternative like this natural silica
formation and lastly we need these deep
life&#39;s principles to be an interactive
guide to keep life&#39;s wisdom right in
front of us we need to become lifelong
learners can we do this people always
say like not in our nature no kind of
species we are we&#39;re kind of species
that does this we&#39;re phenomenal species
and we are nature don&#39;t forget that take
heart we&#39;re very young or only 200,000
years old not 3.8 billion we do have a
very big impact but guess what we can
choose what that impact will be we can
tell our children gentle
and we don&#39;t have to do this alone there
are 30 million species 18 thousand new
ones a year yes many on the ropes
we have no time to lose but we are
surrounded by genius not just in this
room without those doors I live in
western Montana and I am surrounded by
genius
I&#39;m surrounded by 21 wolf packs and I&#39;ve
never seen one come out there all the
time but I know they&#39;re there and one
day there was a wolf because when I saw
I was skiing friend of mine
I had my long skinny skis on we were in
the backcountry and I left a perfectly
good trail do not do this this is not
recommended the reason I did it was I
wanted to sniff a ponderosa pine because
ponderosa pine when they&#39;ve been cooking
all day in the Sun they smell like
vanilla and they&#39;re irresistible my
skied through all these willows and all
this underbrush smelled my pine and then
I realized I was completely stuck and
then I heard a crashing like I have
never heard coming towards me and I
turned around and this was coming
towards me a thousand pounds at 35 miles
an hour but unfortunately he wasn&#39;t
looking at me
he was looking behind him at the wolf
that was probably chasing him and he was
coming straight at me and I was stuck in
my skis and you know when you have that
dream where you&#39;re being chased and you
can&#39;t get anything out I just like and
he heard me because his ears pivot 360
degrees and he heard me run around and
he looked at me just before he hit me
and left up in the air and he turned and
he disappeared
I hoped and I looked and I realized
there was a perfectly formed little game
trail
right next to me and so I took it and it
got me home we have to remember we are
not the first to manufacture but this is
our revolution right we can choose this
it doesn&#39;t have to be as industrial as
the last it doesn&#39;t even have to be a
bloody revolution it can be an evolution
we can go forest bathing but we have to
say this is our revolution and we&#39;re
going to do it differently and luckily
there&#39;s plenty of help out there if we
get this right we get to do what I think
we really really want to do which is to
stay here on this home that is ours but
not ours alone it&#39;s time to make our way
home thank you so much
[Applause]
