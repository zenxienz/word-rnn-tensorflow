thanks very much at the end of the Cold
War the United States made a policy
decision that maybe one of the biggest
mistakes of the 20th century
it&#39;s contributed to create chaos and
uncertainty in this current day and it&#39;s
not based on politics it&#39;s based on
games in game theory there are two types
of games there are finite games and
there are infinite games a finite game
is defined as known players fixed rules
and agreed-upon objective baseball right
an infinite game is defined as known and
unknown players the rules are changeable
and the objective is to perpetuate the
game when you pit a finite player versus
a finite player the system is stable
baseball is stable so is conventional
war for that matter when you pit an
infinite player versus an infinite
player the system is also stable the
Cold War was stable and that&#39;s because
in an infinite game there are no winners
and losers we cannot lose the game and
so we work to keep the game in play
right in fact because there are no
winners and losers the only thing a
player can do is drop out when they
either run out of the resources or the
will to play problems arise however when
you pit a finite player versus an
infinite player
it&#39;s the finite player who then gets
caught in quagmire this happens in
business all the time
the game of business is an infinite game
the concept of business has existed
longer than every single company that
exists right now and it&#39;ll exist long
after all the companies that exist right
now go away the funny thing about
business is the number of companies that
are playing finite they&#39;re playing to
win they&#39;re playing to be the best
they&#39;re playing to beat the quarter or
the year and they&#39;re always frustrated
by that company that has an amazing
vision a long-term vision that seems to
drive them crazy and over the long term
that player will always win and the
other player will run out of resources
or the will and they&#39;ll either go out of
business
will be
or a solder merge required or whatever
it is this is also what happened to the
United States in Vietnam the United
States was fighting to win the Vietcong
were fighting for their lives they would
fight forever if necessary this is also
what happened when the Soviet Union was
in Afghanistan the Soviets were fighting
to beat the Mujahideen and the
Mujahideen were fighting to survive
fighting for their very very lives now
when it comes to policy you have to know
what game you&#39;re playing so you can play
the right rules and this became
completely clear to me when the Soviets
actually drove their tracked tanks into
Afghanistan and Brzezinski the national
security adviser for President Carter
was called into the president&#39;s office
and the president asked him what is the
policy of the United States and
Brzezinski said the policy of the United
States is to eject the Soviet it&#39;s a
finite goal and then almost as an
offhanded comment he says and if we
can&#39;t do that we&#39;ll make it as expensive
as possible for them to stay in other
words the United States accidentally had
an infinite strategy which is not fixed
in time and we don&#39;t know exactly what
it looks like what we&#39;re trying to do is
drain the enemy of will and the
resources to continue to play and ten
years later the Soviets drove their
tanks out of Afghanistan running out of
resources and the will now if you think
about what happened when the Berlin Wall
came down we were in an infinite game
Soviets and the United States and the
Berlin Wall came down and the United
States made again one of the greatest
perhaps one of the greatest blunders
policy blunders of the twentieth century
they announced that they had won the
game they had won the Cold War no they
didn&#39;t the player dropped out because
they ran out of the will or the
resources to play and the problem is is
because they thought they had won the
war they started acting like victors and
the United States imposed their will on
the world for about eleven years and as
it turns out the world didn&#39;t like that
too much and as what happens in all
infinite contests new players started to
him
if you consider how the Cold War existed
it really existed on three tensions
there was a nuclear tension both both
states had nuclear weapons to end all
life there was an ideological tension
one was an exporter of democracy and
capitalism the other one is an exporter
of soviet-style communism and there was
an economic tension that&#39;s what kept the
Cold War alive and well not
coincidentally life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness the only three
things for which we will bear any burden
and pay any price and fight forever to
defend now the nuclear tension has been
replaced by Pakistan and China China was
already there Pakistan North Korea
maybe Iran the ideological tension
soviet-style communism has been replaced
by Islamic extremism and the economic
tension the Soviet Union has been
replaced by China we don&#39;t fear nuclear
war with China but the point is as all
three tensions are alive and well and
you see the problem is is they all know
who their enemy is but we don&#39;t realize
that the Cold War 2.0 is happening and
we are still trying to decide which one
is more important we&#39;re trying to win
and beat all of these things and not
realize that the game is infinite not
finite and the United States policies
these days are become shorter and
shorter term which creates turmoil and
chaos in strategy in how we present
ourselves to the world the easiest way
to understand the game you&#39;re in is when
you have an opposing force in other
words not that right so you want great
leadership you want somebody to say what
we stand for but if you don&#39;t have that
you get to say not that so it was really
easy the intelligence services for
example during the Cold War they fought
like cats and dogs like they fight now
but they could all agree on one thing
not that and they worked really really
well to combine their forces to face the
Soviet Union we don&#39;t have a singular
not that anymore and so we&#39;re all over
the place but all of our enemies all
have a singular not that and it&#39;s us
ideally we want to run all of our
decisions through our values this is
these are what make us enduring our
values our enduring and this is what is
the foundation of an infinite contest
so you&#39;ve consider up here is where our
values lie what I call the why our
values right
these things are infinite they&#39;re
enduring right down here you have what I
call the what these are our interests
and they are finite and ideally what you
want to do is you run all decisions
through our values and then through our
interests let me show you what that
looks like sometimes they go in our
favor and sometimes they don&#39;t so for
example when we go into a battlefield
and we shoot a bad guy we will take his
injured body we will bring him into our
hospitals and we will risk American
lives to bring him into the hospitals
use American doctors American beds
American medicines to nurse him back to
health
that&#39;s not in our interests but the
reason we do it because it&#39;s kind of who
we are it&#39;s kind of what we do it&#39;s like
it&#39;s our thing right when we make a
decision based solely on our interests
it looks like this right
so should we torture people now the
reason we did it offshore is because
everybody kind of knew that that was an
hour thing because if we had no problem
with it we just do it here so we hit it
away because we knew it was
uncomfortable because we know what our
values are so what&#39;s been happening in
the world is we&#39;ve been evaluating all
of the things that have been going on by
ignoring our values because we don&#39;t
realize we&#39;re in an infinite contest and
we only look at our interests so we
think about what should we do in Syria
and we make a very very good decision
based on Syria our interests in Syria we
make a decision and what would she do we
do in Crimea and what would she what
should we do with regards to Putin and
what should we do with regards to Iraq
and Afghanistan and we&#39;re all over the
place and the problem is is when you
pull back and take a look now nobody has
any idea what we stand for this is
confusing for our allies who no longer
trust us because we&#39;re no longer
predictable and it&#39;s fantastic for our
enemies because they can exploit it
ideally what we do is we run
all decisions through our values first
and though it may not always go our way
just like I said we make decisions all
the time that aren&#39;t always in our
interests like bringing an injured bad
guy and putting them in our hospitals
not on our interests but what that does
it makes us predictable and it makes our
allies trust us because they know we
stand for and they will either stand
with us or they&#39;ll stand against us and
together we will go through the infinite
contest for as long as it takes this is
what we&#39;re in right now the Cold War is
alive and well and we will not help
contribute to stabilizing the world
until we start playing the game were in
rather than playing the game we&#39;re not
in thank you very much
