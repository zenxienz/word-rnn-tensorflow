a singularity University and I was on a
short course there a couple months back
and after coming why from there I had
this crazy idea which I called Peter
about turned out he&#39;d had the same idea
and to cut a long story short we&#39;re here
today to join forces and it announced
the creation of a new X Prize and ask
your help in figuring out that what the
rules of it should be because here&#39;s the
concept an artificial intelligence
XPrize presented by Ted to be awarded to
the first artificial intelligence able
to come to this stage present a
compelling TED talk good enough to win a
standing ovation from you the audience
so we&#39;re agnostic as to how that talk
might be presented could be a robot
strolling on to the stage or an avatar
or a disembodied sexy voice and the
standing o criterion isn&#39;t it really
just as a sort of powerful symbol for
the standard the talk should aspire to
assumes an audience briefed
appropriately to be skeptical and the
other measures are in place to prevent
the contest gained Peter you&#39;ve put
seven thoughts into how this might go so
any x prize the rules are the DNA of the
competition what the rules are determine
whether we get the results we want so at
the end of the day we&#39;re in the middle
and actually the beginning of that
design so the question is what should it
be should it be during the year that you
all throughout topics we collect a
hundred different topics and then during
the day where the AI is on stage we go
through those and you randomly select
one and then should the AI have five
minutes to get us talk ready 30 minutes
to get a talk ready and then present it
should be three minutes 18 that&#39;s how
long should it be maybe you vote with
your feet then afterwards Chris you do
one or two questions and maybe some
experts add their opinions in what might
that be so the current
is that each year we might bring two
finalists to to the stage and you know
give a smaller award to the best effort
that year based on your response and
sometime in the future I mean this might
take 20 years who knows when an AI truly
delivers a compelling TED talk that
encapsulates a genuinely new idea then
you all rise and we crown the winner
with a major prize so I guess if we&#39;re
successful it&#39;s a way for us as a
community to kind of track the growth of
AI to discover what computer
intelligence really might do and maybe
also to discover some things that can&#39;t
do along the way we hope it will spur
you know new education opportunities
possibly contribute to the way in which
people and computers work together to
great things and generally contribute to
the powerful dissemination of great
ideas so we&#39;ve been going out to speak
to some amazing people rakers laws going
to have to decide whether he wants to
sort of advise or compete Sebastian
through Nicholas Negroponte but we&#39;d
like to do here is ask the Ted audience
for your input we&#39;ve created a website
it&#39;s just X PRIZE org slash Ted and at
the site tell us do you think it&#39;s a
good idea do you you know how long a TED
talk should it be how do we select the
topics ultimately now how long should
the I have to prepare and then you know
do you think this can be gained and how
can we prevent it from being gamed and
then finally if you have a set of rules
you&#39;d like to put in please join us
we&#39;ll be taking this content will be
coming together with Chris and the team
from Ted and our advisors and announcing
what we hope will be a great XPrize
supported by you the Ted Williams Peter
thank you it&#39;s going to be great fun
what can the deal on this one thank
thank you
