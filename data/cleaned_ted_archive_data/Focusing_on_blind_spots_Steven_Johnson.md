but there&#39;s nothing like being slotted
between Sir Martin and Sir Ken to make a
guy feel like an underachiever so what I
want to say so that the AV team doesn&#39;t
kill me what you are about to hear is
not the sound of the audio system
malfunctioning
[Music]
okay so that may sound a little bit like
a horror movie soundtrack but it is in
fact one of the great artifacts in our
collective ingenuity that is the first
known the earliest known audio recording
in human history now I know what you&#39;re
thinking you&#39;re thinking oh you know
Thomas Edison invented the phonograph
1877 you know I know this story in fact
that recording is from 1860 using a
device called the phonograph that was
patented in France in 1857 by a genius
inventor named Edward leon scott de
martinville when thomas edison was 10
years old full 20 years before edison
started to work on the phonograph it was
an ingenious device it basically took in
sound waves through a kind of a membrane
covered with parchment and that would
vibrate modeled after the anatomy of the
human ear and would convert those
vibrations into a vibrations in a little
pig bristle there would each wave forms
onto a rotating cylinder it was just in
an ingenious and invention is very
unusual particularly in 19th century
technology to be almost a full
generation ahead of the competition in
something like that when you&#39;re 20 years
ahead of Edison you&#39;re doing pretty well
right so the question is why have we
never heard of this guy and the answer
is and this is where the story gets
really interesting that Scott managed to
forget one key feature playback there
was no way to actually listen to the
audio that you recorded now this may
seem a bit odd it&#39;ll be like inventing
the automobile and forgetting to include
the part where the wheels turn around or
you know there&#39;s a reason why when they
rolled out the iPod they they didn&#39;t
forget to include a headphone jack right
you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s got a thousand
songs in your pocket you just can&#39;t
listen to them that&#39;s just nice to know
they&#39;re there
that wouldn&#39;t have done quite so holla
right and so the what&#39;s fasting about it
is it is it Scott didn&#39;t just forget to
include this feature or he wasn&#39;t just
kind of struggling to invent this
feature and get playback it
even occurred to him it wasn&#39;t part of
kind of his frame of possibilites he
didn&#39;t even try to invent playback
something that seems so obvious to us
today the question is why would you even
do that
why would you invent something to record
audio that you couldn&#39;t playback well
his idea was he was obsessed with
sonography and he&#39;d seen this success of
creating little markings on a page that
could take a transcript of what somebody
was saying and you could learn to read
the Mac and he thought if he could
transcribe sound waves onto a cylinder
human beings who turned out to be quite
good at you know deciphering patterns
written onto a page human beings would
learn to read waveforms it would be like
an ultra-fast form of transcription was
actually a pretty good bet it just turns
out that human beings don&#39;t have in
their cognitive toolkit the ability to
read sound waves none of us can do it
even to this day but a wonderful thing
about it ten years ago a group with this
wonderful organization called first
sounds org led by people like David
Giovanni found these old edgings of
waveforms in these archives in Paris and
they took them and they scan them into a
computer and they trained the computer
basically to play them back and convert
them into audio and so a hundred and
fifty years later they heard the sound
of Edward Lee on the Scott scott de
martinville warbling from the grave what
you just heard they&#39;re so wonderful kind
of bringing back to life of this
technology but I bring this up and tell
you this because I think there&#39;s an
important lesson here particularly at in
contacts like Ted which said when when
we study the history of innovation or we
look around us and at all the innovators
around us and in this room we so often
focus on the breakthroughs and the
successes and and the ideas worth
spreading but if you look at the history
of innovation it is almost as often
defined by these blind spots these empty
spaces the thing that seems so obvious
ten years from now that you couldn&#39;t
think of at the time that there wasn&#39;t
in your field of vision so I think it&#39;s
important for all of us as individuals
or as organizations to go about taking
inventory of your past ten years what
was the thing you couldn&#39;t see and what
kept you from seeing it and trying to
figure out what those blind spots were
because
we get good at that and we learn from
the patterns of those older blind spots
we can start to anticipate the things
we&#39;re not seeing now because I guarantee
you they&#39;re out there and by the way not
every blind spot is a dead end Scott
never saw a penny from his invention and
it&#39;s largely forgotten from history but
about fifteen years later another
inventor was tinkering with the
phonautograph
and hit upon a new way to capture and
transmit sound and that guy&#39;s name was
Alexander Graham Bell thank you very
much
