how do you see there are two types of
reality there&#39;s a tangible which is this
current experience that&#39;s a combination
of your senses your perception and your
perspective and as the intangible which
is this blank space for new realities
where you can create it with your mind
and imagination in dreams and ideas I
now want everyone to sort of pause and
retreat race the origin of your current
experience so the chair you&#39;re sitting
on the clothes on your body and even the
building that were in you realize that
everything was first conceived in an
imagination it was an idea that was
created and so basically this tangible
experience is something that first
exists in the intangible and then
happens and so now I want to talk about
exodus exit out of the design school for
Nigeria where we create new realities
for the country through our imagination
and use design process and compassion as
tools to manifest these realities we
nurture ideas through cycles from
imagination to reality in sectors and
States now I personally have used this
model to create new ideas but I also
want to talk about compassion compassion
is something like I feel we need to
discuss as a country as a people and I
and through the cycles we confront
issues on self compassion such as
purpose doubt shame fear an external
compassion such as relationships
tribalism patriotism and even the
environment because I think if we cannot
first face ourselves and how do we begin
to face the country that you know we are
in so I broke down the sector&#39;s into
different categories to aid for a better
design approach so set to do with
identity such as Culture Media Human
Development fabric such as energy
housing and health and skills such as
agriculture where you zoom out
manufacturing and technology and
experience such as disability gender and
just a human experience
I personally have also use this model
like I said before to develop ideas and
I said I first started with the scale
category so in the scale category I
picked resources sector and through that
I learned that clay was this very
interesting material that has been used
by our ancestors and seem to be
forgotten so we found that it was this
energy-efficient material it was very
fine wind protect protective and
resistant it&#39;s a soundproof material as
well as I can anti moisture material and
so I investigated further and zoomed in
a bit more into molecular structure
where I found that there were two
components to it so there&#39;s a
tetrahedron module which is this and
there&#39;s octahedral modules which is this
and so from the island that I could
actually create a wall in clay if I just
mimic its actual molecular structure and
so I started sort of playing around the
populations and sort of came up with a
clay on a module that mimics its
structure and actually kind of start
getting a wall from here and then kind
of went a bit step a step further to
just work around creating a natural clay
module so essentially instead of using
cement perhaps we could begin to think
about using clay the next sector that I
chose based on decks on the experience
category was the trade and commerce so I
have been very passionate actually about
the markets and I actually good it with
my mum all the time because that&#39;s the
cheapest cheapest things you can find
you get in the market and so I designed
a restore which improves the experience
of the informal markets from micro to a
macro scale so I then went to the
markets actually again based on this
model and identified issues that I
wanted to improve such as shelter
seating just a general clutter and
scalability and then came up with a
triangular design store that has
everything that a vendor needed from a
display to sitting to storage and
because of its form could easily be
populated so you see a radial pattern
and then there&#39;s options for linear
aggregation such as these I then may
take this take it a step further and
took it to the markets because I wanted
to account
that idea into skill and then and then
had it be tested for feedback and
refinement because I wanted to see how
it was in that actual contest and I
wanted her this fruit seller to tell me
what she felt about it and so after that
I refined that idea a little bit more
and then took it again to the market for
final implementation yes one of my
favorite architects says you never
change something you never change things
by fighting the existing reality to
change something build a new model that
makes the existing model obsolete an
exodus is the X Exodus is a design model
that is that sir Exodus is the design
model models and harnesses and
manifested the potential of Nigeria and
so I personally have experienced the
broken truth of this country I have
cried I have been frustrated I&#39;ve been
angry but then I took a stance as an
architect and a stance as a designer and
I said that I was going to see through
the lens of my imagination and through
there I realized that anything I
conceived in my mind was possible but I
had to fortify that with my mind my body
my soul my integrity my honesty my
patience and compassion as most of all
my willpower and and from there I feel
that we can design and build a new model
for Nigeria and so I ask again I asked
again I ask again how how do you see
thank you
