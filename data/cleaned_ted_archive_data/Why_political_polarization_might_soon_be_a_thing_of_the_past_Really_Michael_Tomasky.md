thank you all for permitting me to share
my thoughts on the uplifting topic of
political polarization in our country I
want to make three historical points
quickly and I hope excessively to you
first the way we elect legislators our
national legislature Congress is
mandated in the Constitution and the way
we do it has resulted over time in the
existence in the United States of to
really large political parties okay two
really large political parties that&#39;s
what we&#39;re accustomed to here that&#39;s not
what happens all over the world of
course in democracies we have
parliamentary democracies like Germany
France Italy Israel many other places
where they elect their legislatures
differently and where they have many
parties right they have a spectrum of
smaller parties and those parties decide
to make coalition&#39;s together to form
governments it&#39;s a whole different way
of doing things I don&#39;t have time to go
into details now but the way our system
has worked because of the way we elect
legislators in single-member districts
in winner-take-all elections our system
has evolved to have these two big
parties and it&#39;s what we&#39;ve had for the
last 160 years since the Whigs went away
and since we&#39;ve had the Republicans and
the Democrats so that&#39;s fact number one
two big parties fact number two big
parties by their nature are amalgams of
factions right there are Malcolm&#39;s of
factions think quickly with me about the
history of both of our parties the
Democrats started as a southern agrarian
party then they became a party of the
northern immigrants of the political
machines in the cities Tammany Hall here
in New York most famously the Republican
Party started as a mostly New England
based abolitionist party then as the
country expanded geographically as the
territories of the heartland became
States the New Englander said ah there
aren&#39;t enough of us to win in a national
election we better make common cause
with these Heartland agrarians so that&#39;s
how the parties developed again the
history is much more complex than that
but that
how the parties developed that meant
that within the parties there was
division and there were big divisions
within the parties let&#39;s skip ahead to
the 20th century think about the
Democrats in the mid 20th century what
was the Democratic Party deeply divided
over in the 1940s and 50s race because
the Democrats were northern liberals and
southern conservatives southern
segregationists the Republican Party was
divided as well they had the rockefeller
wing the moderates named Nelson
Rockefeller and they had the Goldwater
way the Conservatives name for Goldwater
right so both parties had all these
different moving parts now these
different moving parts they agreed on
enough things that they could function
coherently as political parties but
there were a lot of divisions within
them and that meant there were a lot of
kind of moderate to conservative
Democrats back in those days the 40s 50s
and there were a lot of moderate
Republicans that meant and this is the
third point historical point and the
important point that meant overlap there
was a lot of overlap between the two
parties and that overlap is what made
the compromise possible made the
bipartisanship in Washington possible
but the differences eventually became
too great and so what started in the
1960s was what I call an ideological
sorting out process by which the parties
went apart this started over race and
civil rights when the Democratic Party
embraced civil rights in 1964 that
started a process that moved the
southerners out of the Democratic Party
it took a long time these old habits die
hard but it happened and it certainly is
a process that is complete today then
came the 1970s cultural issues came to
the fore for the first time in the
history of the country abortion wasn&#39;t
an issue before the 1970s the Christian
Coalition entered the political fray in
the 1970s it didn&#39;t exist before then
move to the 1980s ronald reagan&#39;s time
big fights over the size and scope and
role of federal government there were
more of these examples along the way but
I think you see what I&#39;m getting at the
fault lines Hart
between the two parties and the old
overlap disappeared it disappeared
there&#39;s a magazine called National
Journal in Washington which covers
Congress and politics and they&#39;ve been
doing this very interesting exercise
since the early 1980s
they take the voting records of every
senator and they determine the most
conservative Democrat and the most
liberal Republican now when they started
doing this there was a fair amount of
overlap by 2010 there was no overlap at
all the most conservative Democrat was
still more liberal than the most liberal
Republican that&#39;s why we&#39;re polarized
folks it&#39;s not something in the water
it&#39;s not that people got mean it&#39;s not
the attack ads it&#39;s not the money it&#39;s
not the news these things all have
something to do with it sure and they
all feed into it the viciousness of the
news cycle and the corrupting influence
of money in politics but it&#39;s really
these historical forces that have
created our polarized situation now
having said all that what in the world
is the way out of it
well there are three possible rays of
hope that I can offer you tonight that
may unfold if we&#39;re lucky
over the next few years the first is the
big demographic change that&#39;s going on
in this country specifically with regard
with regard to growth of the Latino
population it&#39;s really changing the
character of the electorate it&#39;s
changing specifically the character of
the electorate in some key presidential
states most notably Florida Florida used
to be reliably Republican because the
Latino population was a smaller and B
was Republican it was Cuban American and
it was reliably Republican that&#39;s
changed in the last decade or so it&#39;s
now only half Cuban it&#39;s half Puerto
Rican poor Ricans of course are very
overwhelmingly Democratic also the
younger generation of Cuban Americans
are more liberal than conservative much
more so than their grandparents so
Florida has really changed and it&#39;s a
harbinger of other changes to come in
Florida I would say I would not yet say
it&#39;s unwinnable for a Republican the
polls are still pretty close but but if
these trends continue it will be soon
unwinnable for a Republican candidate
and
Texas will follow in 2024 28 and once
that happens then the Republican Party
really has to look at itself and I think
specifically it will have to embrace
immigration reform with a path to
citizenship it&#39;s going to be a hard
fight within the Republican Party but I
think they&#39;re gonna have to do it and
opposition to immigration reform is like
the glue on the heart right and once
that glue is dissolved other things will
move so that&#39;s number one number two
also has pertains to the Republican
Party it is at a crossroads because of
Donald Trump there&#39;s a lot of division
obviously within the party over him if
he wins I think there&#39;ll be a faction
within the party that will rise up to
oppose some of his more extreme measures
and that could lead to some moderating
tendencies within the Republican Party
and then if he loses then that would
mean that the Republicans have lost
three elections in a row and any time a
party loses three elections in a row
they kind of take a look in the mirror
the Democrats lost three in a row some
of you will recall in 1980 84 and 88 and
after the 88 lost they said all right we
really do have to move to the center now
and they did so in the person of Bill
Clinton there are some reasons to think
that the Republicans won&#39;t do that there
will be great resistance to doing that
within certain circles of the Republican
Party but this will be fought out in the
party and maybe we can hope that the
forces of comparative moderation might
prevail that&#39;s number two number three
now I&#39;m going to get a little technical
on you and then what we call in
Washington processing but number three
has entirely to do with the filibuster
I&#39;m sure many of you know the filibuster
is a Senate rule that makes it possible
for a minority of senators just 41
senators to prevent the Senate from
passing anything now this again is going
to be a very very difficult contentious
process but there is talk in Washington
of changing this rule so you no longer
need 60 senators to pass a bill it&#39;s
ridiculous it&#39;s something that in the
old days the Senate used to do very
rarely but now they do all the time
everybody knows it&#39;s a problem nobody&#39;s
going to be willing to take that first
step but you know eventually somebody is
eventually somebody is that&#39;s why I put
this into the future at maybe six seven
eight years it&#39;s not something that&#39;s
going to be solved quickly it&#39;s not
something that&#39;s going to be solved
easily but you know historical errors do
come and go right they do change the era
of bipartisan cooperation ended and
changed gave way to the era that we&#39;re
in now this era will end sometime too so
all is not lost my friends always not
lost thank
