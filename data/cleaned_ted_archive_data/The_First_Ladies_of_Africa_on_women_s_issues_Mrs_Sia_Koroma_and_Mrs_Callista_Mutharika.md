my first
Shin is how do you see your role as
first ladies thank you how do I see my
role as a first lady perhaps let me
begin by saying that I come from Malawi
and Malawi&#39;s in the southern part of
Africa itself bothered by tanzania
applause zambia in the west and
mozambique in the east and southern part
now to the question I see myself as a
wife to the president I see myself as a
mother to my biological children as well
as to the children that we look after in
the house but further to that I also see
myself as a mother to the nation because
everybody calls me am I am I and am I
means my mother my mother so who could
not accept if you were offered children
children are so sweet so I see myself as
a mother to the nation but further to
that I also see myself as a campaigner
of women&#39;s issues issues to deal with
clean water because we know that water
is life clean water is very important
more especially for the woman so I want
to see women have clean water but also
issues of education education is very
important for the girl child and for the
women so that they are able to make
informed decisions and so on a source of
we know all about that but I also see
myself having a role of ensuring that
the women in my country have food in
their homes and I think these issues
they come natural to me perhaps because
of my background the environment where I
live
you know I think most people would take
most criminal pick up these issues if
they lived in a country like Malawi
thank you no I tell you that I&#39;m commit
there was a member of parliament then
became a member of the president&#39;s
cabinet in the car so here&#39;s a little
bit of an interesting background and the
first lady from la presse the first lady
Koroma isn&#39;t a different role in the
last ten years of last 25 years with
regard to your being a first lady I
would say over the past 10 years sir
alan is coming out of a civil war it is
categorized as a responsive function we
the state was devoid of a first lady
simply because the guide now there is a
vacuum even before she died first lady&#39;s
rule was Lily humanitarian charitable
and philanthropic acts they were
housewife who just reported instances
for the largest present and state
functions and I know that&#39;s not what
you&#39;re doing now go on Ella my darling
[Music]
what do you think your role is as first
lady well my role is very very similar
to my sister in Malawi my nation called
me mama for short wasn&#39;t the mother of
the nation I always also regard myself
as a god model Venetian an assistant to
the younger females the role is simple I
complement the president&#39;s efforts on my
husband settled and because of our
unique position of being first ladies we
can influence both the people
and those who governed as a result I&#39;m
involved in a lot of advocacy workers I
raised the awareness of standing issues
affecting the health and well-being of
my people how did you figure out of you
what to focus our first lady no daddy
thank you I think have been been brought
up in that African environment and also
seeing the problems that women say
especially having faced face to face
with somebody say dying because of lack
of medical facilities whilst giving
birth and also knowing some friends who
have died whilst giving birth I think
any one of us know would take up that
challenge to see to it that no one dies
while giving birth and also you know
walking throughout the villages in
Malawi on a weekday and you need a full
going child and you ask them as to why
they are not in school and they give you
one of these answers I am too hungry to
go to school that&#39;s why I can&#39;t go
because even if I went to school I
wouldn&#39;t be able to understand what the
teacher will be saying all they give you
an answer like I have no clothes to wear
to go to school all I have no notebook
to write on no pencil to use so madam I
can&#39;t go to school
what would you do you would be forced to
do something about it and therefore I
chose issues to do is face motherhood
issues to do with vulnerable children
issues to do with the empowerment of
women because of what I face as a woman
of what we all face as women what would
we find some of the barriers are that
you have to overcome first lady Koroma
well sir Lowell is a small country for
some fifty two percent of the population
a female seventy percent live in the
rural areas where the live on
subsistence farming there&#39;s a high
literacy high fertility rate women
cannot make decisions about their health
due to cultural barriers unknown and
taboos in certain areas for more reasons
girls are not allowed to go to school in
certain areas so these are all various
communications via barrier when you
raise the profile a bit technology is
absent we need help in those areas under
so it&#39;s a male dominant world we have we
still have glass feelings to break women
are still marginalized most of them are
rural hall where the problem is soon
there&#39;s a lot of balance also I think
that many things that we you alluded to
them that we don&#39;t think of that so many
girls don&#39;t go to school if they are
menstruating they don&#39;t have the
facilities to do that so much of a day
in a woman&#39;s life involves time poverty
taking three four or five hours to get
clean water what are some of the areas
that you&#39;ve worked on where you found
settle in Malawi if we go to secondary
schools we find that girls enrolment is
only at twenty-six percent so I made it
a point that I go to several schools and
inspire girls to stay in school despite
all the problems one of them is
important the one that you&#39;ve just
mentioned that sometimes you don&#39;t find
that there enough sanitation facilities
for the gills and so they drop out but
another problem I think that we have in
the country and that I&#39;m working on is
the fact that as we are fitted in here
out of 100,000 let me start by saying
807 women out of every 100,000 dies
while giving birth and that is if you
put it in simple terms but it&#39;s about
one in eight or one in nine who did do
something about it if you had the
privilege and the position and the power
in order to be able to change that
scenario and thus that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing
at the moment that why I established the
safest motherhood but also in a country
of 14 million people you find that about
a million of that population is
hiv-positive and about 1 million
children are orphaned and about five
hundred thousand families our child
headed meaning the oldest in the family
is under the age of sixty
both parents have died would you not be
forced to do something most of us would
be forced to do something so I am
working with vulnerable children as well
and what results can you share with us
surely I have been an advocate for
maternal health issues because one of
the worst things that could ever happen
to anybody is to die of childbirth but
we&#39;ll lose the baby when you give back
to have been an avid convener when my
husband came to office in 2007 we had a
maternal mortality rate of one thousand
three hundred four hundred thousand life
passes most recent demographic studies
show that we have 857 100,000 men
thought and that is used to the
intervention of Iraqis are created an
office of the first lady Australian
which is renewal fee they will avoid the
Ministry government government of Sierra
Leone the plethora of un partners in
particular ENFP and most of all the
demons and I know that you are all
trying to get together as first ladies
and figure out how you can bring best
case practices together for the
continent would you like to comment on
it
yes first of all you had that question
regarding whether the role of the first
lady has changed or not and perhaps out
there it is changing because the first
ladies of the past in Africa we are not
doing the sort of things that we are
doing now so we find and people like
yourself anyway women&#39;s campaign
international Rockefeller Foundation in
the forefront telling us that we ladies
values of Africa you now must realize
that it is important to bear in mind the
fact that you have to leave a legacy so
now the word legacy is coming in to us
and we are learning to work towards
ensuring that we leave a legacy after we
have left office and everybody wants a
good reputation every everybody wants to
remembered for something else and that&#39;s
what we are trying to do we want
everybody to remember for the good
things that we have done so you find
that we are all we are now beginning to
be changed people thank you very much
