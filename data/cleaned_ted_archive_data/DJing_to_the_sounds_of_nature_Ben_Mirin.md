when I moved to New York City three
years ago I had no idea that I was going
to become a wildlife DJ I&#39;ve been a
lifelong bird watcher still AM
and I needed a way to reconnect with
nature but I&#39;m also a musician and so I
sat down at my computer started
listening to different bird songs online
and put a few down to some beats just to
see what would happen lo and behold now
I travel the world as an explorer
recording the sounds of different kinds
of animals for scientific research but I
also sample those voices to create
original music that inspires
conservation and celebrates the natural
beauty and musicality of nature my work
is ruses me to a lot of really colorful
characters like this yellow headed black
bird he&#39;s such a character I I first met
him in the Sierra Nevada mountains last
summer on a recording expedition I
recorded his voice along with several
other species and then made a song out
of it that sounds like this yeah the
other birds
[Music]
it&#39;s pretty easy when the sounds of
major stone musical on their own when I
can&#39;t travel to an ecosystem myself I
collaborate with the McCawley library at
the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and
together we assemble a kit of sounds of
voices but bring a place to life and I&#39;d
like to take you on a world tour now
through four different ecosystems
they&#39;re amazing for very different
reasons let&#39;s introduce some of the cast
for today&#39;s show we have empress cicadas
from Borneo we have the sounds of the
American Southwest from the Sonoran
Desert table Elina pigs that I kick
drums down
you have APIs Ren trail so many
different species roadrunner that&#39;s a
sound we have yeah I like to imitate
them we have parrot fish chipping away
at coral their sharp beaks and the base
of a humpback whale pretty much perfect
pret never hurt see what I mean there&#39;s
music all over the world and last but
not least he has the runic of a hot of
a.m. mockingbird singing in the
Chesapeake Bay to a nice backdrop of
crickets and secatur that high notice is
a katydid let&#39;s mix things up a little
bit
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
you&#39;re a nobody
[Music]
come on think
[Music]
see right that way they ride that way
they ride that beat like an ocean wave
[Music]
weakness weakness by giving in to what I
love nature and music I discovered
something much bigger than myself music
and art can connect us all to the wild
world in many different ways it
essentially turns conservation into an
international language that anybody can
dance to and anybody can understand I
work around the world now doing concerts
like this with local sounds that I
record on expedition to connect people
to the sounds of their own backyard in
every case I notice that the lesson is
basically the same people love to
celebrate what they feel close to and
it&#39;s just opens up a door to broaden the
future for what our next generation of
explorers conservationists and
scientists can all achieve I think they
deserve the opportunity and so do we
because we all share the same future and
they&#39;re going to push our understanding
forward for how we share this amazing
blue marble with all these incredible
animals after all the whole world is
singing we might as well tune in thanks
so much for listening
[Applause]
