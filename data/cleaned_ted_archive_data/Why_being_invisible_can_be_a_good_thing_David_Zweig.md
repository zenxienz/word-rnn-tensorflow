thank you you arrive at the airport you
check-in you make your way through
security maybe you stop off and grab a
sandwich use the restroom you finally
arrive at your gate while you were doing
this you&#39;re probably checking email on
your phone maybe you&#39;re talking with
some friends via text maybe you&#39;re
thinking about work at best you were
probably half paying attention as you
wandered around this ridiculously large
and complex place yet if you got from
point A to B to C without getting lost
it&#39;s not an accident it&#39;s because of a
man named Jim Harding or one of his
colleagues Jim Harding works in an
unusual field called
wayfinding these are the people who
design the signs and systems to help us
navigate or find our way through complex
environments like airports hospitals
even cities they figure out which
typefaces to use which ones are the most
legible from a distance what
illustrations can be understood by the
greatest number of people
they even angle aisles and certain ways
all these different things to usher us
from one place to the next often without
us even realizing it and that&#39;s the
thing I want to focus on about Jim
Harding&#39;s work that when it&#39;s at its
best it goes by unnoticed he simply
wants you to get from one place to the
next without even thinking about it and
this is really the opposite of how so
many of us operate for most of us the
better we do our work the more
recognition we receive yet for Jim
Harding perfection equals invisibility
he told me that for him for his work to
go unnoticed it&#39;s a mark of honor and a
source of deep satisfaction how strange
that is because we live in a culture
today where attention seems to be valued
above everything else you know where
reality TV shows come and go but they&#39;ve
never canceled one because there weren&#39;t
enough contestants and we all sort of
seek our own little
micro celebrity don&#39;t we where we&#39;re all
spending so much time online kind of
secretly hoping for more and more likes
on every post hoping for evermore
followers
we&#39;re told that to get ahead in business
you need to raise your profile or build
a platform the best ditch seems to be
that we&#39;re told that the more attention
we receive for ourselves and for our
work the better off we&#39;re going to be
but what if this is a vast myth what if
in order to become really successful and
to be really fulfilled and satisfied
what if that can happen without gaining
any attention at all I traveled around
the states to Europe and Asia to meet
with people like Jim Harding Invisibles
people who are really skilled at what
they do whose work is critical to
whatever endeavor they&#39;re a part of but
yet who go largely unnoticed by the
public I wanted to know in a culture
where recognition is valued so highly
what kind of person chooses to work
behind the scenes and thrives there and
I found despite a really wide range of
fields and industries that all these
people work in that they share certain
traits the most important of which is
that they have a real ambivalence toward
recognition they simply don&#39;t seek
attention the way it seems so many of us
do and yet amazingly this attitude by
not seeking attention is actually what
brought them their success another
invisible is a man named Dennis poon he
is a structural engineer on many of the
world&#39;s tallest skyscrapers he is on the
board of directors of a global
engineering firm these buildings cost
billions of dollars to create the safety
and soundness of these buildings rests
on his calculations now the frank lloyd
wright&#39;s and the Frank Gehry&#39;s of the
world are going to get all the
recognition but without Dennis poon and
his colleagues their buildings wouldn&#39;t
stand dennis poon in his role with all
that enormous responsibility
the vast teams of workers underneath his
charge he is a leader and yet dennis
poon whenever i asked him a question
about himself invariably answered we
instead of i
and I found this collaborative mindset
that he had common among all the
Invisibles that I met with and again
this attitude brought this guy to the
very top of his field by not trying to
be this big person out front but by
seeing himself as something as part of
something larger
I first met Peter Stumpp
when he was buried under the lid of a
Steinway concert grand piano like a
mechanic&#39;s under the hood of a Rolls
Royce
Peter stuff is a renowned piano
technician and he works for a renowned
Symphony Orchestra except he&#39;s not like
the guy who comes to your house and just
Tunes your piano at home Peter Stumpp
spends days and days working
meticulously behind the scenes changing
not just the tuning on the pianos but
adjusting the weight and the height of
the keys how the felt hits the strings
all these little meticulous details that
he works on that oftentimes the
musicians the conductor and the crowd
don&#39;t even know all they know is
everything sounds great
and for Peter Stumpp that&#39;s all that
matters he told me my name is never in
the brochure and I&#39;m fine with that
because when I&#39;m sitting in the audience
and I hear Emanuel Ax a famous pianist
performing I feel as though I&#39;m having a
duet Peter stumps behind the scenes
meticulousness again another core trait
of these Invisibles he doesn&#39;t care if
anyone knows about all the details he
did he just wants a great end result
we&#39;re told that we need to promote
ourselves and we do sometimes in
different circumstances but what the
Invisibles show us is that by embodying
certain traits and that by valuing
yourself as part of something larger
that they are both the antithesis and
the antidote to our age of relentless
self-promotion thank you
