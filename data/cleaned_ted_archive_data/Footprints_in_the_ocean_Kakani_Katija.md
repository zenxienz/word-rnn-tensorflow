quick show of hands how many of you grew
up watching Star Trek whoa now hold your
hands up I want everyone to look around
and despite us being at Ted women
there&#39;s a lot of us who grew up with
Star Trek right and watching Star Trek
was actually a huge family affair in our
household my dad and my brother were
really interested in the technology that
the crew were using my mom on the other
hand was a little into Captain Kirk
right whereas I was absolutely
captivated by this idea that a crew of
people were going to these far-off
places looking for life and it was
actually this search for a life this
exploration that inspired me to become
an aerospace engineer but at some point
I stopped looking for life in outer
space
and instead started to look at life much
closer to home and the footage that
you&#39;re looking at right now is not a
star field it&#39;s actually the ocean at
400 meters or a quarter of a mile deep
and what you&#39;re looking at is marine
snow and unlike outer space where we
have yet been able to find life the
ocean and every drop of it is teeming
with life
and so that&#39;s why I&#39;ve become a
bioengineer to learn more about this
mysterious place as well as the
organisms that inhabit it so the ocean
is inhabited by a lot of alien and
crazy-looking organisms like this one
and we&#39;re constantly finding and
discovering more of these organisms
every day so this organism looks pretty
big right on the screen but actually
this animal is about a centimeter or
about an inch in size and most of marine
organisms are even smaller than that so
imagine such a small organism living in
a really dynamic environment where food
and nutrients and the things that are
necessary to sustain life are really
limited and food for these organisms are
isn&#39;t really that appetizing for these
small animals they largely feed on
marine snow which is made up of
particles mucus and dead bodies of other
organisms right pretty delicious but
mixing of the ocean the transport of
these nutrients and elements that are
necessary to sustain life is vitally
important to the ocean and those
organisms and I study whether or not
organisms are able to contribute to that
mixing in some way and so let me explain
how we go about doing that
so this is my dog Kiran I know I think
she&#39;s pretty cute too and if you&#39;re
wondering she&#39;s an English Shepherd
they&#39;re fantastic dogs but I want you to
ignore her and focus on the footprints
that she&#39;s left behind
now footprints for the trained eye
provides a lot of information right it
can tell us something about that
organism what it was and also what it
was doing at the time now trust really
organisms will leave footprints behind
in sand or dirt but marine organisms
will leave footprints what we call
hydrodynamic signatures behind in fluid
but because fluid is transparent you
have to add something to it right and so
what you&#39;re going to see is a dye
visualization that clearly illuminate
what these hydrodynamic signatures are
and so like terrestrial footprints these
hydrodynamic signatures provide a lot of
information for us it tells us something
about who that organism is and also what
it was doing at that time is it feeding
or is it swimming and so not only can we
visualize what these Hydra
signatures look like we can also measure
them using some tools that are available
as normally in only a laboratory
environment and so using lasers and
high-speed cameras we can actually
illuminate particles that surround
organisms in the water that they swim
through and so using these particle
images over time what we can do is
compute and get a velocity field or a
velocity information and that can tell
us a lot of additional information about
their sweetie swimming and feeding
ability as well as their mixing ability
and we&#39;ve also developed a device if
you&#39;re wondering that&#39;s me holding it
it&#39;s a mobile device that allows scuba
divers to swim to the organism or the
process that they&#39;re interested in
measuring and measure those hydrodynamic
signatures that are present and so you
may be wondering what things have we
learned from this and we&#39;ve looked at a
lot of different organisms and if you
look at the snapshots of each one of
those hydrodynamic signatures you&#39;ll
know that they are distinct and they
vary depending on the kind of behavior
that organism is undergoing but in
addition to these hydrodynamic
signatures we also noticed a feature
that has never been seen before and if
you look at this dive visualization I
want you to focus on the volume of fluid
that&#39;s following the animal closely
behind it and so for these long
distances and animals travel you could
see that that volume of fluid continues
following that organism as well and so
doing experimental and numerical tests
we&#39;re actually able to show that this
feature allows organisms to mix fluid in
regions or in distances that are much
greater than themselves
so think about that if a single organism
is able to generate mixing of a fluid
that&#39;s in a region that&#39;s bigger than
itself what happens
when you have many organisms and so it&#39;s
a very interesting question right and
there are many implications it says you
have populations of organisms swimming
around in an environment what kind of
effect is that having for instance what
are these implications right so are
these organisms by creating these
hydrodynamic signatures are they having
any effect on the physical and chemical
makeup of our oceans
how has overfishing right the mass
removal of biological mixers how has
that affected the health of our oceans
and we also know that the ocean is
extremely important in the process of
absorbing carbon dioxide from our
atmosphere which has implications for
our climate what role if any do these
tiny tiny organisms play on larger
processes in the ocean so the only
honest answer I can give you right now
is that we don&#39;t know but that&#39;s okay
because this is science right and
through the scientific iterative process
that it is we can eventually accumulate
enough evidence to determine whether or
not this process is indeed important to
the ocean and so this topic biogenic
ocean mixing is really brand-new and
it&#39;s up to us to come up with evidence
that either supports this idea or
negates it and so you may be wondering
what&#39;s next
and how can we possibly know everything
we need to know about the ocean if we&#39;re
only looking at organisms and processes
at the surface and so with colleagues of
mine from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute we are developing and
deploying new technology that allows us
to measure hydrodynamic signals of
organisms from the surface to four
thousand meters or two-and-a-half miles
deep and we&#39;re going to be looking at
how fluid and nutrients are transported
through the oceans like this organism
it&#39;s a couple centimeters or inches big
it&#39;s able to extract about 1/3 of all
particles near the surface here in
Monterey Bay and deposit them on the
boat at the bottom of the ocean we can
also look at the longest organisms on
our planet and learn how they swim and
it can inspire and allow us to develop
underwater vehicles of the future and
finally we can look at swarming
organisms and whether or not they have
an impact on mixing in the ocean and so
I hope I&#39;ve convinced you all and that
by developing this new technology and
deploying it we can reveal unseen worlds
and learn how fluid motion will affect
these organisms and by studying things
that are alien to us we can actually
inform something about topics and
processes that are very important to us
thank you
