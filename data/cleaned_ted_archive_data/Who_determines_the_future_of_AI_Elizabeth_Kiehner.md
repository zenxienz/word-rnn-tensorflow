so when we think about artificial
intelligence we set up this crossroad
where we often hear like a quote like
this a very apocalyptic picture painted
for us about what the future is going to
be like I&#39;m here to fly in the face of
that you might refer to this Stephen
Hawking quote or similar quotes made
from elon musk or even from bill gates I
have a much more optimistic outlook that
I want to talk about with you here today
so when we think about AI the term was
first coined in 1956 that&#39;s 61 years ago
and since then we&#39;ve done very little to
educate the general public on the
nuances of artificial intelligence and
what that actually means what is this
impact on our lives so the first thing
that I want to draw a distinction around
is the difference between artificial
intelligence and artificial general
intelligence a new acronym AGI so if you
remember one thing AGI come away with
that tonight and tell your friends
because artificial general intelligence
is what people typically think of when
they imagine that robot buddy they&#39;re
going to have in the future that has
full autonomy total consciousness it
might be as intelligent as fam it might
be even a little bit more intelligent
than them we are so far away from that
today and it&#39;s something that we may not
even see in our lifetime I think we&#39;re
focusing our attention on the wrong
thing I want to argue that we should be
scrutinizing people it&#39;s the people who
are doing the programming of AI today
that really have an impact on driving
the future of where this technology goes
and people are wonderful but we all have
so much baggage don&#39;t we we have biases
and we have prejudices and we have all
sorts of different ethical values
beliefs and religions that inform and
what we do every day and we bring that
with us quite frankly to our work but we
luckily have new rules for the cognitive
era so we have at IBM establish the role
of an
six adviser we have field testing in our
production process before anything gets
deployed and then explanation based
collateral systems so if you&#39;re working
with Watson and you ask Watson a
question you will not only get a very
quick answer you&#39;ll find out the level
of confidence Watson has in that answer
you&#39;ll find out all of the rationale
behind the decision making process so
that&#39;s really great right but what about
bias what happens when we talk about
bias who here in this room would purport
to be biased raise your hand that&#39;s
great it&#39;s everyone and it&#39;s inevitable
that humans are all bias it&#39;s part of
what makes us human quite frankly and
these gut instincts and our feelings
that we sometimes get in the pit of our
stomach that give us a sense you know I
should do this thing instead of that all
of these underlying fundamental drivers
which sometimes include religion help us
to inform the up to 35,000 decisions we
make on average each and every day so
what about turning our attention now to
religion who here in the room believes
in God so whether you do or not you&#39;ve
certainly heard of this quote before we
all have and I would argue that we stand
here today at this point where we&#39;re
creating artificial intelligence in our
own image and we need to be very very
careful about how we&#39;re doing that and
how we&#39;re programming for that so if we
turn the table the other way and ask
Watson hey Watson do you believe in God
how would Watson respond well that would
actually depend on which instance of
Watson you are talking to Watson is
trained in several different domains and
has very deep domain knowledge in each
of those areas so are we talking to
financial services Watson or are we
talking to legal Watson we might be
lucky enough to talked about Watson who
won jeopardy but today let&#39;s pretend
that we&#39;re talking to the Watson that&#39;s
very skilled in understanding medicine
and oncology
and when we think about that we&#39;re
definitely treading in the territory of
life and death and with life and death
inevitably comes up the topic of
religion just think back a few years to
all of the controversy that was
surrounding the Terri Schiavo case and
then pivot for a moment to other legal
aspects such as the fact that there are
13 countries in the world where being an
atheist is illegal not only is it
illegal but it is punishable by death
and you see how important it is for us
to consider what religion means when we
train our cognitive systems so we have
these people that we call quality
experts and it&#39;s pretty easy for us now
to take structured and unstructured data
and feed it into Watson but what we have
to understand and where the subjectivity
comes in is another acronym called URL
that&#39;s our ability to help Watson
understand and reason and learn and
that&#39;s the area again where we need to
focus our attention as to what we&#39;re
programming into the systems as well as
algorithmic accountability what&#39;s
happening in our data sets where is the
data coming from is it coming from a
safe source and our our data sets biased
ultimately when we look at the values
that were embedding into the system
we&#39;re going to ultimately need to agree
on what those are and where they&#39;re
coming from are they reflective of
judeo-christian values are they
reflective of secular values or they
reflective of values that we haven&#39;t
even defined it that is what keeps me up
at night despite that I have a very very
positive feeling about the future in
just three years will see 5 million
people connected to the Internet that&#39;s
more than half of the world global
population so all different people from
different races religions colors Creed&#39;s
working together online be it with AI be
it with quantum computing on the cloud
it&#39;ll be
miraculous time for us to think together
so what I asked you here today and the
question on the table that I want to
leave you with is really this the
question is not whether machines think
but whether humans do thank you very
much
