as a conceptual artist my work always
begins and ends with an idea the more I
refine my ideas and develop as an artist
the more I find language to be the most
direct and appropriate material for
realizing them at the surface level
language appeals to me because it&#39;s
accessible in order to understand my
work a person only needs to know how to
read but upon closer inspection one
simple word or in this case the absence
of it can contain a world of meaning I&#39;m
particularly interested in the way we
use language to regard and refer to the
passing time the word now for example is
so specific and yet so ambiguous now
could refer to this very second the
length of this talk this week this year
this century and since I&#39;m a sculptor at
heart at some point I began to think of
words as objects I started to give words
like now a physical form and ask
questions like how long is now or what&#39;s
the distance between now and then this
custom engraved sign says now on one
side and then on the other when mounted
to a wall in a corridor the sign is like
a blade that slices through a person&#39;s
path dividing time and space the sign
physically delineate the past from the
present or if you approach it from the
other direction the present from the
future but now isn&#39;t static it&#39;s dynamic
so I decided to incorporate motion and
mutation into the word itself this
kinetic sculpture uses motorized acrylic
line segments to spell the word now
about once every second the lines that
construct it slowed down ever so
slightly as the word forms but just like
time itself they never quite come to a
complete stop one moment is continuously
and infinitely being replaced by another
eternity is a sculpture i made in
collaboration with my partner mike
fleming we mounted 30 electric clocks to
the back of a large piece of white
acrylic arranged their hour and minute
hands to spell the word eternity and
then plugged all the clocks into a
series of power strips on the floor so
when the switch on the last power strip
is flipped the hands begin to move
and the word almost immediately
disappears into a jumble of black lines
eternity doesn&#39;t reappear until the
clocks our hands naturally return to
their original positions exactly 12
hours later by definition eternity is a
state to which time has no application
for a brief moment every 12 hours this
sculpture allows a legible word to
appear using clocks that would
ordinarily keep time to materialize the
immaterial concept of timelessness
wonder is a kinetic sculpture that&#39;s
brought to life by the movement of other
it uses a proximity sensor to form and
fragment the word when a viewer is near
or far when viewed from a distance the
work almost appears to be a painting of
a constellation in the night sky but as
a person approaches the motorized white
dots begin to move and then close slowly
coalesce to spell the word wonder and in
hopes of figuring out what causes the
sculpture to move viewers engage and
interact with it in really playful and
spontaneous ways by allowing their
curiosity to get the better of them they
discover the one they&#39;re hidden within
the work whether or not they ever see
the word wonder is both a noun and a
verb it&#39;s a feeling of surprise caused
by something beautiful unexpected
unfamiliar or inexplicable it&#39;s also an
action a desire to know something that&#39;s
currently unknown to wonder is to play
unlike a child discover something
unexpected about yourself and the world
around you my art practice is founded on
my
own sense of wonder and it&#39;s my personal
goal to create works of art that inspire
a sense of wonder and others thank you
