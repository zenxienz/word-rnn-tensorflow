at eight years old I started my own
business called Maya&#39;s ideas and I make
eco-friendly clothing and accessories
I&#39;m 13 now and although i started my
business in 2008 my artistic journey
started waiting for them I&#39;ve been
growing ever since I could hold a crayon
and I&#39;ve been making animated flipbook
since I was three years old animation
art has always been my first love I was
really influenced the art and I want to
incorporate and everything I did even my
business I was finding fifth fabrics
around the house and say this could be a
scarf or hat and I had all these ideas
for design I noticed when I wore my
creations people will stop me and say
wow that&#39;s really cute where can I get
one and I thought I can start my own
business now I didn&#39;t have any business
plan to only eight years old I only knew
at once make pretty creations that were
safe in the environment and I wanted to
get back my mom taught me how to sew and
on my back porch I was didn&#39;t make hip
dance and out of ribbon write down the
names in the prices of each other the
first time I saw was a headband I major
headache zebra print and I read the file
on it I name is Lee reply I thought it
was the craziest combination but I had a
feeling it would self and it is I
started making more item like hat scarf
and back to my name&#39;s began snowing all
over the world to places like Denmark
and Italy I had a lot to learn about my
business like branding and marketing
staying engaged in my customers and
seeing what sold the most and relief I
learned it&#39;s good for things to go wrong
with business because we gain experience
knowledge and skills doing what you love
makes work easier and just remember you
have to work hard and be committed it
will be worth it in the end
I&#39;ve had a section for protecting the
environment and its creatures since I
was little my parents taught me at an
early age about giving back and being a
good suit to the environment so when I
started my business I knew two things
all of my items has the eco-friendly and
sandal and percent of the profits i made
went to local and global charities and
environmental organization even though
I&#39;m 13 I understand that we need to save
our plan for future generations because
our descendants men that has anything
left that makes me even more passionate
to save it from destruction another way
I spread the word is through animation I
learned about when animator was well as
three there is a program on TV about
jobs most kids didn&#39;t know about when I
understood an animator makes the
cartoons i saw on TV I immediately said
that&#39;s who I want to be I don&#39;t notice
it mentally or ll but that was a great
leader fining moment in my life what I
love about art was to painting dancing
or music so you can tell a story as far
as a movement the creative spirit that
is art I&#39;m working on our anime series
called the Palmers it&#39;s about bees and
other pollinators in our environment and
why they&#39;re so important I decide take
these creatures and make a super drill
team
