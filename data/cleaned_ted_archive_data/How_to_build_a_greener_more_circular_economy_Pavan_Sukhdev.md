the last two and a half decades have
seen scientists economists politicians
say again and again and more and more
often that we need to change economic
direction we need a green economy a
circular economy otherwise how will we
avoid climate change
how will we ensure ecological security
how will we achieve sustainable
development but despite all that
agreement we are still hurtling towards
planetary boundaries on greenhouse gas
emissions on phosphorus depletion on
nitrogen pollution on biodiversity loss
on ecosystem degradation the list goes
on
why is this I think this is because we
really haven&#39;t paid enough attention to
what&#39;s really driving the economy look
at this 3/4 of the economy measured in
GDP and jobs in the u.s. is private
sector worldwide that answer is 2/3 it
is today&#39;s cooperation that is driving
resource use in economic direction and
today&#39;s cooperation is not with
apologies to some in the audience the
small family business or the small and
medium enterprise or even the big family
business it is the multinational
cooperation now the question that begs
to be asked is therefore is today&#39;s
cooperation going to deliver us
tomorrow&#39;s green and sustainable economy
well I&#39;ve been looking at this issue for
some time and there are some patterns
that emerge if you look at the economic
history of the cooperation over the last
hundred years the pursuit of profits has
become a pursuit of size and we see this
in examples like Volkswagen first
incident they wanted to become the
world&#39;s number one car company beating
Toyota so the investigation
technology and some special software and
the rest is history let&#39;s look at his
fiend in the last 40 years 1970 to 2010
the number of corporations whose
turnover exceeded 0.1 percent of global
GDP like that&#39;s like a small country
went up from just 20 companies to a
hundred and twenty companies that&#39;s the
kind of bulking up of size that I&#39;m
talking about today&#39;s corporation the
multinational has become kind of an
international arbitrage or of sorts
arbitrage inge resources where mining
license are cheapest and easily
available usually some African country
arbitraging labor where it&#39;s available
in in supply in China India Bangladesh
and then are we charging manufacturing
capacity from wherever that&#39;s most
easily provided and subsidized you know
Korea or Malaysia India and obtaining
consumer markets where they are richest
in the US Japan Europe and the
high-net-worth sections of the BRIC
countries that is today&#39;s multinational
and that&#39;s really what&#39;s driving this
economy another thing that we see coming
up again and again is leverage and the
use of leverage and this is literally
ignoring all the lessons that we&#39;ve
learned over the last four recessions
which have been driven by the overuse of
leverage excessive leverage or the abuse
of leverage the net result of this is
that the cooperation becomes what we
call too big to fail and by this I don&#39;t
just mean the banks in too big to fail
because you know caring and settlement
would stop but I&#39;m talking about
insurance companies AIG too big to fail
needs to be rescued car companies
General Motors too big to fail another
rescue right Swissair airlines too big
to fail oh how could I forget hedge
funds LTCM remember too big to fail you
know hedge funds these sort of Mother
Teresa outfits who need US taxpayers
money to save them you know markets get
tough
whatever happened this concept you know
in economics we had this concept that
markets are supposed to punish the
missed allocation of capital what
happened to that product I want
something else I&#39;ve noticed is the
increasing and aggressive use of
lobbying which has almost become part of
the job of senior management and a
highly effective return on their on
their time
it&#39;s about tilting the playing field so
that it&#39;s tilted in your direction keeps
out competition keeps the advantages and
licenses you have in your hands and
sometimes it means also obfuscating
reality and this can go on for decades
at a time we&#39;ll take X form for instance
in 1977 there scientists told the
management that there was a significant
problem with emissions from fossil fuels
which would cause climate change in the
early eighties their own ships went out
carrying state-of-the-art equipment to
test this theory and the results were
conclusive and immediately after that
and for the next 30 years they went into
an aggressive campaign of climate denial
successfully defeating a number of
climate regulations and end controls how
could I also forget leaded gasoline that
went on for 60 years it was in fact in
nineteen twenty early 20s that research
at both Yale and Harvard University
proved that there was serious health
damage from leaded gasoline but of
course it was only in the 70s and 80s
that this was banned so these are all
the results of lobbying in this case
from Standard Oil way back and then
General Motors and then many other car
companies and then the use of
advertising without ethics and
advertising is after all about opinions
it&#39;s not about facts
it is about persuasion it&#39;s it&#39;s not
about information but and it&#39;s also
there basically to create desirability
you know like the desirability of
cigarette smoking which you saw in so
many advertisements and on television
until of course five decades later radio
and television advertising was banned
for cigarettes we have all of this
happening and leading to what I call
externalities the third-party cost of
doing business as usual and the size of
corporate externalities is absolutely
humongous we are talking about trillions
of dollars of public costs of making
these private profits this is the
biggest free lunch in the history of
mankind so we have an agency problem of
monumental proportions because the
economies main agent that is the
corporation is basically moving the
economy in the wrong direction so what
do we do what&#39;s the theory of change
well firstly I must not apologize for
the complexity of these slides that I&#39;m
gonna show you and talk you through
because we have a complex problem and
I&#39;m afraid complex problems only have
complex solutions and the complex
problem we have right now with the
economy&#39;s main agent is that it&#39;s
leading to and driving excessive demand
because of uncontrolled I mean
consumerism driven by the corporation is
leading to underprice supply and
basically everything is really unreal
in price terms and its leading to very
damaging resource depletion and of
course and most of all in my opinion is
leading to public capital losses
especially the loss of natural capital
in the process of making private profits
but driving all these big picture
system-wide macro issues we find that
there are in fact micro level drivers
drivers at the corporation level and
that is a problem but the good news is
that there are also micro level
solutions so when we look at marketing
and advertising it is actually the ad
brilliance of corporations and their
advertising agencies which converts
human insecurities and to once-once into
needs needs into demand demand into
production production into profits and
thereby hangs a tail it is of course
possible to correct this and one
possible good example is the European
cosmetics Association which actually has
detailed rules about for example how not
to use sex and children in advertising
we look at leverage again this is of
course a problem but there are solutions
we&#39;ve used capital limits in the past
quite successfully consortium
arrangements have worked and so on the
the problem with resources and excessive
use of resources is partly because we
don&#39;t tax resource use or excessive use
of resources and that&#39;s coming because
of the typical tendency of taxing the
goods and not taxing the bads
however Norway has a 79 percent tax on
resources on on fossil fuels extracted
in the North Sea and when I asked the
Environment and development minister
eric hoerlein don&#39;t the companies
complain I mean won&#39;t they leave he just
smiled in reply I said yes they&#39;ve been
complaining for the last 25 years but
they&#39;re still here and last but not
release the externalization of course
today we are within two weeks of the
launch of something called the natural
capital protocol this is a huge exercise
involving all of the form accountancy
majors and most of the large
corporations over 50 companies have
committed to be pilots this natural
capital protocol will basically provide
a framework for any company anywhere to
be able to measure and disclose its
impacts on nature on environmental
impacts if we follow all these things I
believe we will achieve a different kind
of cooperation the cooperation is like a
species it responds like any species to
its environment which in this case is
policies prices and institutions I
believe we can through this approach
achieve unchanged in the cooperation
towards one which basically heralds in
stakeholder capitalism not just share
all the capitalism which has goals
aligned with society which is a
custodian of nature and takes care to
reduce limit and manage its
environmental impact
which is a community that builds social
capital such as naturae in brazil which
is a company which is selling cosmetics
and personal products not to shops
because it doesn&#39;t have any but through
1.5 million housewives who are trained
by the company who are paid thirty three
percent commission and whom the process
not only on self-respect and income but
are able to use it to educate and
provide better health for their children
there are companies who act as
institutes emphasis india&#39;s information
technology giant trains 30,000 new
graduate severe in its university some
of them will leave as people do and they
will carry with them that knowledge
training skill and brand value
externalities which are positive for the
corporation this sounds good but our
investors interested and the interesting
thing is if you look at the recent
statistics they are the amount of assets
debt and equity that are taken through
the lens of sustainability has increased
almost 30 percent per year from 13
trillion dollars 21 trillion dollars and
what this means is that the investors
are looking at assets which almost now
one-tenth of the total asset class
around the world of 215 trillion
companies are beginning to measure their
impacts their externalities and
beginning to report them integrated
reporting has been around for a bit but
now here what we are seeing with these
leading companies some of whom are my
clients is that they are measuring
externalities in economic and social
terms and putting them out for others to
see these are companies from chemicals
to forestry to luxury travel to a water
utility but unfortunately these are
still too few for any real change so the
question is how can we scale up and
speed up this evolution well I&#39;m gonna
do my small bit for that I have decided
to put the IP the intellectual property
of my company on the web so the IP ml
process that we do for our clients will
become public knowledge animals
and I&#39;m now looking for money to raise
capital so that we can create a very
simplified package so that even the SME
can make use of this technology
something you know the 199 dollar
variety which can be made available
easily and frankly once we&#39;ve done that
I think the cost barrier will have gone
away and then I will be targeting not
ten potential users but ten thousand
users and at that point I&#39;m sure the
accountancy firms will think hmmm why
can&#39;t this be done on a regular basis
for all the world I think that of all
the changes that can possibly assure in
the era of cooperation 2020 this is
probably the one that we matter most
wish me luck thank you
