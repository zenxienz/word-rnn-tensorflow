have you ever had that I&#39;m in over my
head
and they&#39;re going to find out feelings
maybe is when you got a promotion or you
started a business or you landed in a
new role like the highly qualified
administrator who couldn&#39;t believe they
gave her the job once she got there she
found out the hiring committee had come
directly from a wine function she said
AHA they were drunk or maybe you&#39;ve said
if I can do it how hard can it be I
actually heard he got a if I can get a
PhD in astrophysics from Caltech anybody
can this tendency to discount or
diminish obvious evidence of our
abilities is called the imposter
syndrome the first time I heard the term
I was a 21 year old doctoral student at
the same University where my mom was
working as a night janitor I instantly
identified and showed it other the other
students as a matter of fact we decide
to start a little impostor support group
we started meeting and talking about big
intellectual frauds and how we&#39;re
fooling all of our professors and
everything went great for about three
weeks and that&#39;s about the time I
started to have this nagging sense that
even though everyone else was saying
they were an impostor
like I knew I was the only real impostor
decades later and psychologists are
still telling us that the way to
overcome impostor syndrome is to just
keep talking about it the more we can
talk about our supposed ineptness the
better we&#39;ll feel I don&#39;t know if
anybody ever talked about how fat you
feel like do you feel any thinner
talking about impostor feelings is a
start but you can&#39;t share your way out
of impostor syndrome so what does work
well it begins by recognizing the people
who really don&#39;t feel like Impostors are
no more intelligent or capable than you
or I
that the only difference between them
and us is they think different thoughts
that&#39;s it which is really good news
because it means all we have to do is
learn to think like a non imposter for
example the big difference means people
who feel like imposter some people who
don&#39;t is no one likes to fail no one
likes to make a mistake no one likes to
not know the answer or to have an off
day or to struggle to master something
but when these things happen to
Impostors we experience shame like the
woman who is the head of a large Medical
Center who said to me I feel like an
impostor because everyone else on the
executive team is brilliantly articulate
and I&#39;m not now there was a time when I
would have said to her oh I&#39;m sure
you&#39;re brilliantly articulate but now I
know that wouldn&#39;t have served her so
instead I said well maybe you&#39;re not
maybe you&#39;re not and that&#39;s okay she was
thinking like an impostor
non Impostors no they can&#39;t be brilliant
at everything and they&#39;re fine with that
the reason we have to pay attention to
the conversation going on in our head so
we can reframe it the way a non impostor
would my favorite reframe of all time
came from Daniel Boone the wilderness
explorer who said I was never lost but
it was bewildered once for three days
[Applause]
that is a very good refrain somebody in
serious need of a refrain was a friend
of mine who was asked to put together a
major presentation at the last minute
she nailed it but all she could think of
was oh man that was just a bunch of BS I
threw together at the last minute what&#39;s
the reframe how about wow how good am i
that I can pull together information at
the 11th hour that other people
genuinely find useful that last part is
really important because it speaks to a
contradiction in impostor logic because
when you think about it what we&#39;re
really saying is other people are so
stupid they don&#39;t realize we&#39;re
incompetent to imagine if you&#39;d come up
to my friend and said that was great and
she look to you and said seriously
Wow I mean you get out the house much or
what right how arrogant how absurd would
that sound what should she say in that
situation yes thank you
exactly the thing about impostor
syndrome is that it affects up to 70% of
people not just high achievers but it&#39;s
a confidence issue for a lot of people
so for years I would give people ten
ways to combat impostor syndrome there
was always that one person who would say
but is there anything else we can do and
I would say well of the ten things I
just gave you what did you try right
well I&#39;m not saying buzz there anything
else we can do it took me a while but I
finally figured out what was happening
what they wanted was to walk in the room
feeling like an impostor and walk out of
the room not feeling like an impostor
and that&#39;s not how it works in fact
feelings are the last to change do you
want to stop feeling like an impostor
then you have to stop thinking like an
impostor how would you like to feel
confident 24/7 yeah good luck with that
because that&#39;s not that&#39;s not how
confidence works your body doesn&#39;t know
the difference between fear and
excitement so as you&#39;re walking up to
the podium or into the meeting or any
place where your confidence is shaky you
have to say to yourself I&#39;m excited I&#39;m
excited yes you don&#39;t believe it and
that&#39;s okay because now you know that
you don&#39;t have to feel confident to act
confident and over time you really will
begin to believe the new thoughts and
when you do you can stop trying to
overcome impostor syndrome and instead
just use reframing to talk yourself down
faster that way instead of having an
impostor life you can have an impostor
moment thank you
so we&#39;re going to have valerie stay up
for a couple minutes while i ask you
just a few questions while we set up for
our next speaker so 70 percent that&#39;s a
lot is are they&#39;re measurable
consequences for a business or a company
when people have impostor syndrome in
within the company yeah absolutely
when you feel like an impostor you have
to find ways to deal with the anxiety of
kind of waiting for the other shoe to
drop so some of the coping mechanisms
are things like flying under the radar
you know not raising your hand not
asking for promotions not giving your
ideas and sharing in meetings
procrastination you know when I was
supposed to be writing my dissertation I
had the cleanest house in Northampton
Massachusetts workaholism self-sabotage
so all of those things they work they do
the job but at a cost and if you have
number of people in the organization
engaging in those behaviors you&#39;re going
to have a cost to the organization as
well totally and and for managers who
might see that their employees are
experiencing impostor syndrome what are
some ways they can help mitigate and how
can they help yeah one of the best
things a manager or leader can do is to
normalize it and to to talk about it and
if you have imposter feelings to talk
about it in a very offhanded
matter-of-fact way like oh that&#39;s that
impostor thing oh yeah some of the
brightest people on the planet have
these feelings
I mean Maya Angelou said I&#39;ve written 11
book and every time I write another one
I think oh I pulled another one over on
everyone and they&#39;re going to find out
so know that you&#39;re an excellent company
with some of the most you know talented
people on the planet awesome thank you
so much Valerie thank you
