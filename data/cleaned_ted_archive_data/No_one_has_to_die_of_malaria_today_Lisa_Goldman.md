in these next three minutes six people
will die of malaria 3,000 a day and 90
percent of the deaths are in Africa many
of you know this but almost all of them
are young children and pregnant women
and if you look it&#39;s an ancient problem
the malaria was described accurately
2700 BC and the plants that are used
today to derive the remedies have been
used for centuries in some places but
the parasite and being awfully mosquito
that relationship was not identified
until the early 1900s and if you look at
the map of malaria and de Missa tee it&#39;s
almost the same map as the lowest income
per capita in the world and the highest
child mortality rate now we knocked it
out in the West but think about it if
people are sick they can&#39;t work or study
very well so it costs 13 billion dollars
a year in GDP and now Africa is fighting
back there are a lot of new innovations
that you&#39;ll hear about for vaccines and
cures but there are three interventions
that the w-h-o recommends that are
effective and work right now
artemiy some combination therapy it
costs about a dollar a dose indoor
residual spraying which spray the
interior walls with insecticide and that
lasts about six months and then
long-lasting insecticide nets which cost
about ten dollars delivered and lasts
for five years so there&#39;s still a big
challenge with distribution if you look
at these these are very bulky products
one net 40 nets or one Bale and you have
to get these products down a road that
looks like this with road maintenance
that
takes place with whatever is at hand and
there are a lot of people down those
roads not just a few so it&#39;s a big
challenge to get this is the last mile
what the last mile might look like but
if you ask the people who have received
the 30 million bednets and 1 million AC
T&#39;s that the Global Fund delivered in
the last year they&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s
making a very big difference in their
lives in this village they say that they
cannot remember a time when there were
so many fat babies that I know you have
to believe that and the children are
doing better in school because they&#39;re
able to focus on their studies they&#39;re
well rested and the adults are able to
earn more income they&#39;re working more
productively because they&#39;re not sick
all the time
so the bottom line is nobody has to die
of malaria today we have the tools right
now
