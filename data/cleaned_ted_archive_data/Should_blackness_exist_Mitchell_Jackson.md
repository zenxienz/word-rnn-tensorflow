so in 1949 the United Nations charged
or some of renowned scientists was
studying a race problem in 1950 those
experts reached a general agreement that
the idea of race is a biological myth
declaring mankind is one all men belong
to the same species Homo sapiens so I
was born like 25 years later and I can
tell you throughout my childhood and
youth it was like not a soul in America
got the memo by the time I was playing
Biddy basketball the outcomes of my
blackness may as well have been cheers
making sure that I knew or felt that a
black baby was five times more likely to
be born out of wedlock than a white one
then years later I was six times more
likely to go to prison than a grown
white baby that my mama my mama was what
the elephant&#39;s called a welfare clean
and if I was murdered there be a 93%
chance it&#39;d be by someone black look I
know we just met dawn but I want to
share something with you that uh I&#39;m
both ashamed and proud of I used to be a
drug dealer and there were times in that
life I thought oh my god
this guy is gonna kill me the time to
scare me the most
I was selling some dope to this dude
named Rob I hopped in his car I handed
him with no he handed me a sack with the
sack bail life so I reached in hoping
for thousands and instead God might not
believe money and tissue I was like what
is this some kind of joke then a guy
sprang up from the backseat and choked
me and smashed a gun to the side of my
head don&#39;t say one word he said sir I
put off driving all car while I&#39;m
begging in the lab me going every so
often I got the gonna smack me upside my
head and threatened to kill me I
recognized the voice of the gunman is
that of an old high school classmate
yeah we went to school together
and his name was stitches Rob stitches
and me are defined as black which means
if they had made the paper or the news
which it didn&#39;t it could have been
classified as yet another instance of
black on black crime and that fact is
crucial to what I came to discuss what I
believe is the most important element of
black on black crime blackness before I
get to blackness though I really want to
rap to you about whiteness for a second
that whiteness is many historians
scholars and philosophers have argued is
an invention of the Europeans who
colonized what became the USA and
secured by methods including
propagandizing ideas like that
vade concept of phenotype as well as by
laws policy terror and death that
whiteness as my hero James Baldwin
argued has been absolutely a moral
choice so I got another question for you
this one&#39;s a little more serious though
if you could choose to abolish white
power and white privilege and white
supremacy would you do it
now what if I asked if you&#39;d also banish
blackness while white people were
inventing themselves they also were
forging blackness by means that included
propagandizing ideas like that very
concept of phenotype as well as by laws
policy terror and death any of that
sound familiar you&#39;re right both
blackness and whiteness come from the
same place the deep me to debase exploit
and oppress groups of humans so call me
crazy but I propose to address the crux
of America&#39;s race problem at large to
address in specific the troubling
product of race known as black on black
crime
we must void the ideas of whiteness and
blackness I mean how could we call for
the death of whiteness and let live the
greatest creation of a people who
believe themselves white people who
believe themselves black yeah there&#39;s
much talk now securing the black body
and there are many me included
proclaiming black lives matter there
have been movements of black pride and
black power that have been mantras of
ooh black is beautiful and too black too
strong and though all of them are meant
to empower and they have done so they
all are also rooted in an identity meant
to subjugate and dehumanize the group I
call my people
colored Negro black African American
look this is not me trying to revive
that ages old argument to my people to
receive a new lengua now nor am I ever
trying to distance myself from them like
I don&#39;t know how y&#39;all do out here but
I&#39;m down for my folks like fo flat tires
nor what I ever try to knock the
necessity known as black culture but
what I am saying is this by claiming
blackness as who we are we&#39;ve been
coerced into complicity into reminding
those who believe themselves white of
their privilege and perceive higher
status
we must revolutionize the idea of
blackness and in this case the most
revolutionaries being we can do that I
can do is refuse it as a racial category
and an idea so I can just hear the
naysayers you know so what&#39;s this new
America gonna look like Mitch what&#39;s
gonna be the bedrock of these new
identities keep it all the way real with
y&#39;all I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m happy happy
to assist how I can in the search for
answers
if this sounds to you all like a Q&amp;A and
an Africana Studies class guess what
it&#39;s because it&#39;s so often is the first
time I heard anyone deconstruct the idea
of whiteness I was at New York
University this was like 2002 and give
you a little perspective on it for that
privilege I was paying tuition that
equaled near twice what my mother has
earned in any year of her working life
give you a little more context I&#39;d
already justified being a woman ours and
many times over I&#39;d had my baby girl out
of wedlock
I&#39;ve been to prison and already I&#39;ve
been to prison and more than once gave
serious thought I&#39;m talking deep
contemplation to whether I could or
should murder someone is payback now I
am not attributing those decisions to my
blackness but I&#39;d like to believe if
I&#39;ve been given the tools to critique
blackness and whiteness and some of the
way as I do now I would have made wiser
choices I know one thing
would have been damn tough to make worse
once
so anyways right sighs armed with what I
know now I can&#39;t help but wonder what ro
internalized blackness played and what
stitches did to me and what he did to
his former home boys I can&#39;t help but
wonder what would have happened if when
I came face-to-face with someone who
wounded up to me in the middle of the
night to buy crack or when stitches
looked across at the man he killed
instead of a seen a colored or a Negro
or a black man or woman or an
african-american or even an American we
have been given the chance to perceive
even a chance to perceive with those
long-ago inventors of blackness and
whiteness never ever wanted us to see a
fellow human being thank you
