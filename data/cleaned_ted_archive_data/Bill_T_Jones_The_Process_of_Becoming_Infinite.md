okay you
[Music]
I dreamed I didn&#39;t dream I was in
Connecticut in about 1983 at Kent school
for boys I was an affiliate artist and I
was invited to be there because they
thought the lads needed exposure to all
culture including dance well as his
lovely man said to me that day he said
you know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t want you
to take this the wrong way but we liked
you because you had an athletic style
and you know those guys from the Joffrey
they&#39;re just - they&#39;re just - well my
job was to dance on campus and to attend
classes I remember the day that was a
class on Dostoyevsky and we were talking
about evil and good but evil and then
the Box changed to thinking the mind and
one of the guys said to me well when
you&#39;re dancing you must shut off your
mind so I had a concert to do and I
thought yeah buster I got something for
you
and it was called 21 now I could stand
here and give you all the reasons that I
am here today I will get around to it
but they were concern that you had
context context for what I&#39;m saying and
what I&#39;m doing context is everything
right so this dance is kind of what we
call in my world a task-based
choreography it comes from a phase in
the last 30 40 years of modern dance
development which is extremely
interested in process as performance
it&#39;s a long journey folks it&#39;s like
going down a road I don&#39;t know where
it&#39;s going there are three or more
stories but I&#39;m going down a road and
I&#39;m asking you to go with me to go with
me
