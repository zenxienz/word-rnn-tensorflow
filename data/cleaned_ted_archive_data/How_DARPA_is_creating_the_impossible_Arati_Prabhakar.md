good evening this is a circuit that
melts away when its work is done
and here is a tool that delves into the
deep web and the dark web to find human
traffickers these are the kinds of
robots that could one day navigate
through a damaged nuclear reactor and
prevent a meltdown this is a vehicle
designed to withstand a massive blast so
our soldiers can walk away uninjured and
here in my hand I have a neutron
detector and a gamma ray detector it&#39;s
small enough that first responders can
carry it everywhere creating a city
scale network so that they can detect
nuclear materials before a terrorist
detonates a bomb these are just a few
things
these are just a few of the things that
we&#39;re working on today at DARPA the
Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency and tonight I want to talk with
you about one of our areas of work that
is going to stretch our minds in
completely new ways it&#39;s the area of
neuro technology and this is where
breakthroughs in electronics and
neuroscience and algorithms are coming
together to enable a new kind of
seamless symbiosis between people and
technology it&#39;s going to exhilarate us
it&#39;s going to make us deeply
uncomfortable and it could even cause us
to reassess what it means to be human
now why is a Defense Research agency
even thinking about this the answer to
that begins in 1957 that&#39;s the year that
this happened the shock in the United
States when the Soviets launched Sputnik
at the height of the Cold War was
palpable and in its wake our country
created DARPA to prevent technological
surprise our predecessors quickly
realized that the best way to do that is
to create some surprises of our own and
over time we&#39;ve done that in two
different ways sometimes we see a really
tough military challenge and we go after
it with a revolutionary approach so we
made it possible to create a stealth
aircraft like this that to an enemy
radar looks as Tiny as this but a
different motivation drove DARPA
development of the ARPANET and the
Internet of powerful chip technologies
and advanced materials here we saw
bubbling pots of research that we&#39;re
still immature but that allowed us to
dream about groundbreaking capabilities
and with the private investment and the
entrepreneurship that followed we were
able to enable the incredibly rich and
complex information environment that
we&#39;re all living in every day so today
when we see those early signs of
technological surprise we go after them
and one of the areas where we&#39;re seeing
those signs today is neuro technology
because think about it we are surrounded
by exabytes of data networks that
operate at trillions of bits per second
and here a different prodigious
capability in each of our brains many
tens of billions of neurons able to do
things that no computer can do but our
link to the information realm is a
keyboard and a mouse it&#39;s sort of like
two supercomputers that are relegated to
talking to each other like this it takes
you right back doesn&#39;t it so neuro
technology has the potential to change
that and our work here begins by
focusing on the problems of wounded
military servicemembers it as we do that
research so it opens the door to
something more let me show you please
meet Nathan and Jan these two are each
paralyzed below the neck in the study
that they&#39;re participating in they&#39;ve
each had small arrays placed on their
motor cortex and from those arrays the
researchers in this lab are able to pick
up the electrical signals from those
specific neurons translate them in
real-time and use them to drive a
prosthetic arm and this is what&#39;s
happening here Jan is thinking about
moving her own arm she&#39;s trying to get
that chocolate bar within reach and she
got it
Jan is amazing and you know when she did
this this was the first time since she&#39;s
been paralyzed that she&#39;s been able to
feed herself a bite of chocolate when
Jan started this study that was one of
the first things she wanted to do which
tells you about this woman&#39;s priorities
I like that so you know because Jan can
use her thoughts to control that arm she
can use her thoughts to control other
kinds of tools to even an airplane and
in fact Jan got to try out a flight
simulator just by thinking about it she
was able to do controlled dives and she
even took a spin in an f-35 fighter jet
so Jan in the work that she&#39;s been doing
she&#39;s able to move things she can move
that arm but she couldn&#39;t feel the
chocolate bar that it held in it in its
hand
Nathan also has implants on his sensory
cortex and here he&#39;s able to receive
electrical signals that allow him to
experience the sense of touch
watch as the researcher presses the
mechanical fingers here index pinky
middle index the middle and that&#39;s the
first time
and that&#39;s the first time that Nathan
has experienced the sensation of his
fingers being touched for over a decade
now Jan and Nathan are only part of the
story of neuro technology today we&#39;re
also working to try to repair the kind
of memory loss that can come with
traumatic brain injury and when we do
that we also open the door to the
possibility of enhancing memory or
accelerating learning we&#39;re working to
fix the neural miss firings and the
imbalances that can result in
psychiatric disease and that work opens
the door to the possibility of
customized mental health States and
we&#39;re working to use the peripheral
nervous system to monitor and to
maintain the organs of the body and that
opens the possibility to people being
able to directly control their
physiological functions for example
regulating your own bill you&#39;re on blood
pressure now this is research it&#39;s not
yet robust capability but already it
allows us to dream about a future in
which we will have harnessed the power
of human brains and the power of
technology together first control our
individual capabilities but also to
start weaving an intimate ecosystem of
interconnected capabilities now with
these big possibilities come some big
choices in a possible future neuro
technologies could enable a warfighter
to focus under fire by turning his heart
rate down or to sense an odorless
biological threat or to directly and
intuitively control a bevy of military
systems that could keep the adversary at
bay in that future will the military
banned neural enhancement the way we ban
performance-enhancing steroids today or
conversely is there a future in which
neural enhancement
comes a condition of military service in
a possible future neural tech not narrow
technologies could enable people across
society to overcome depression to boost
our physical health to learn complex
tasks in a flash to connect among
ourselves in new and deeper ways in that
future will society think about neuro
technologies the way we currently think
about SAT test prep or braces or even
laser eye surgery we just think it&#39;s a
personal choice or is there even a time
when we can start to imagine a growing
gap a disturbing gap between the neural
enhancement haves and have-nots could
some basic level of neural enhancement
come to be seen as a right and not just
a privilege these are some of the
choices ahead and they are choices for
all of us not just for the technologists
among us at d&#39;arco we pursue these
powerful technologies because of their
power that&#39;s our mission it&#39;s what we do
for our country but we know that the
very power of these technologies means
that they can be used for good or for
ill so this story of possible futures
how it turns out depends on you and you
and you these big choices belong to all
of us and as we shape our future with
these extraordinary technologies in the
choices we make we will reveal who we
are and who we will become as human
beings thank you
you
