so I&#39;m sure that quite a few quite a few
of you have heard the warning beware of
the uncanny valley yeah yeah and so
don&#39;t see all of Wikipedia charts of
course I thought I&#39;d supply you one
while explaining that the uncanny valley
really is a Nimbus of coal and but more
so a hypothesis in the field of human
aesthetics that says that if something
is more than 85 percent ourselves human
looking but less than 95 percent human
looking but a real human so I&#39;ll find it
kind of uncomfortable it&#39;s a little
awkward you know things like zombies for
example and uncanny valley and so I
can&#39;t even compare this to everyone&#39;s
favorite caffeinated beverage
hysterically mine coffee no a nice iced
coffee is amazing a hot coffee I&#39;ll take
one of those too but the real problem
here is when your hot coffee has gone
cold and you have this really awkward
cold cup of coffee in which you know you
need the caffeine but you can&#39;t really
drink it you know what what are you
doing thinking about that is how you
might drink this anyway because it&#39;s
functional it&#39;s fascinating but there&#39;s
nothing delightful about it you don&#39;t
connect with it you don&#39;t get excited
about it and so it sounds like things
that are close to right but not quite
dying like that cold cup of coffee feel
really wrong and somebody who loves
connecting one industry to the other I
do like to think of wearable technology
this way
so we have our I fancy techno centric
consumer he&#39;s got all the devices he&#39;s
using them all at once cuz that&#39;s what
we&#39;re supposed to do he&#39;s getting his
tweets in his oh he picks the cool guy
on the block 15 effects look at him
honestly makes me feel a little
uncomfortable and I feel like because
he&#39;s not really vibing with that either
and even though we have wonderfully
functional technology it&#39;s not really
suiting us we&#39;re missing an essential
element which is ergonomic design put
book out with her body on the market a
big-ass neuralyzer example which is an
amazing touch sensitive piece of
technology which is fantastic but the
thing about it is that it stops you a
so headband and I don&#39;t know about you
but never really worn one of those so I
don&#39;t really it&#39;s not only that really
connect with me on on the other hand
though something that&#39;s essential to
human connection is being able to look
someone in the eye and understand them
and this is kind of economic design oh I
was great as augmented reality is we
still have to remember that we&#39;re
designing for humans to look at one
another and so designing something that
flops that vision really isn&#39;t enhancing
the human experience of creating a
different experience and I think that
focusing on the human experience is so
important when it comes to wearable
technology so how do we make more
ergonomic design if your the answer is
to create multidisciplinary teams so we
have a team that&#39;s working to have been
collaborating so we should have a piece
being passing the technologists the
designer and back and forth and we argue
insight and think about it kinds of
great conclusions and all of this jazz
and I feel like what we&#39;re doing right
now currently it&#39;s kind of the
equivalent of a choice a free line where
the technologists or engineer designs or
create something they design the
schematics or we may pass it off to the
designer to make it look prettier pretty
as they can and then we put it to the
market there&#39;s no real back enforcement
because a lot of design often isn&#39;t
moving into what we&#39;re creating it&#39;s a
pie on top of what we&#39;re creating and so
why do we want economic design in the
first place right it&#39;s for easy
integration so when we&#39;re young we learn
to use all these amazing tools around us
and since we&#39;re all eating here I
thought this spoon would be a lovely
example of a tool that we&#39;ve all learned
to use since we were very young and of
course isn&#39;t technological but the thing
is auditors that it has in urban Amish
and very visceral connection with us so
if I&#39;m using a silver spoon I feel very
fancy because I&#39;m using a plastic spoon
that&#39;s exciting one of do dishes at
night if I&#39;m using my hands or them you
know feel kind of savage it&#39;s not very
polite and I have this emotional
connection to this very simple but well
designed object so how do you get
wearable technology to how that same
sort of connection with us
generally when you want to have a
connection with someone else he asked
them questions right but not too many we
don&#39;t want to be nosy destroyed model
questions and with that in mind we
created a company called created where
we do research and development for
future of wearable things so things are
entrusted the body by asking questions
one of our questions was can clothing be
modular thanks to technology so
concluding meet us where we are and so
if I&#39;m always going to it trying to fit
into it different ways our outcome was a
shirt called I go back so essentially is
controlled by a computer interface to
change shape hypothetically sunbae
completely transforming from one thing
to the other another question we ask is
is to multidisciplinary ideation create
new products specifically over certain
topics so we talked about wearables and
particularly batteries what kind of new
energy forms can we get to power the
wearables that we have thinking teams of
everything from scientists to designers
to general weirdos just look at the
topic and see if we can build something
in that really collaborative mindset
then another question we asked ourselves
is that can I both be inexpensive
inexpensive because that means that it&#39;s
inclusive and it&#39;s kind of more
whimsical it&#39;s not this deep pocketed
fancy toy that you showed out there
people but something that your son might
also have I might you can use to connect
with one another so we created a pendant
called tribe that is used at events and
you can connect with other people by
sending them white messages so at the
end of the day as you always created our
own uncanny valley here we looked at
well-designed in economic objects like
the spoons we see how all this works
first meant we enjoyed using things like
this however in the middle Falls really
highly technical objects that have
functional but not organ AMA cos I&#39;m
which takes the facts right ethnocentric
uber-cool consumer so what we really
hope
and what we&#39;re trying to are created is
get to the other side about uncanny
valley so how can we combine economic
design and highly functional technology
in order to create a bond between humans
and objects and I think that&#39;s really
where the future of wearable technology
lies thank you
