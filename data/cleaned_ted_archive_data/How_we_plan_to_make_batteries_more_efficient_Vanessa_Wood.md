as someone who researches batteries I&#39;m
often asked Vanessa when will I get a
better battery my first response is
better how a battery user I of course
want better everything I want a battery
the charges faster
I want a battery that lasts longer on a
single charge I want a cheaper battery
and I want one that performs as well as
it did when I first bought it but as a
battery researcher I know there are
trade-offs among all these different
features batteries are inexpensive
primarily because they are spit off
battery manufacturing lines at a rate of
about one battery every few seconds it&#39;s
this incredibly fast manufacturing speed
that makes it challenging to improve all
these performance parameters at the same
time but to start to understand how we
can move beyond trade-offs let&#39;s look
into a battery in a lithium ion battery
you have three long thin layers that are
rolled up a cross section through these
layers look something like this energy
density in your battery is determined by
how much active material that is how
many of these blue particles you have in
how much space and what they&#39;re made of
charging speed and a battery is
determined by how fast you can shuttle
lithium ions from active particles in
one layer to active particles in the
opposite layer discharge speed is simply
how fast this process happens in Reverse
now we&#39;ve seen that battery technology
has been advanced incredibly in the past
25 years but surprisingly many of the
complex processes that go on inside a
battery are still not well understood
so this reason trial and error still
plays an important role in battery
development for this reason my group has
worked for the last six years to try to
better understand fundamental processes
inside batteries we&#39;ve developed x-ray
based techniques to actually look inside
batteries as they operate this enables
us to directly see what the problems are
and which solutions work
here you see a subvolume of inside of
your battery the flake lake particles
are graphite which are used in about 95%
of lithium-ion batteries today when you
charge your battery lithium is inserted
into the graphite particles and the
particles expand when you discharge your
battery lithium leaves the graphite
particles and they contract
manufacturers like graphite because in
addition to being cheap it can tolerate
this immense mechanical stress every
time you charge and discharge your
battery but the flake like shape of
graphite makes for a long complicated
path along which your lithium ions have
to travel and we&#39;ve shown with our x-ray
imaging approaches that it&#39;s this long
complex path that limits how fast you
can charge your battery this led to the
formation of battery on a startup
company out of my group battery on
developed a technique to align the
active particles inside your battery
such that lithium has a shorter or less
twisted path to follow
this means manufacturers can stick with
graphite as a cheap and mechanically
robust material but give you a battery
that charges faster all while not
sacrificing energy density or battery
life so better batteries as someone who
quite literally spends her time looking
into batteries I&#39;m excited by what I see
inside there&#39;s still tremendous
potential for chemistry and engineering
to bring us all around better batteries
and of course while I&#39;m looking forward
to getting one of these batteries and my
cell phone and my computer all around
better batteries have a far more
important role to play
they will enable affordable electric
transportation and they will make it
possible to store intermittent renewable
energies like wind and solar thank you
very much
