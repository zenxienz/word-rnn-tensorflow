hi everyone let&#39;s do something fun and
unusual for a TED talk ok I want you all
to break up into groups of four and
share with your group a story from your
childhood that reveals whether you&#39;re an
introvert or an extrovert and introvert
or extrovert and then I&#39;m going to ask
each group to select the most personal
poignant private of these stories and
share them with the audience as a whole
and from this collaborative group
process a larger truth will emerge I&#39;m
just kidding I&#39;m just kidding we&#39;re not
going to do that but how many of you
were thinking how can I get out of here
right now without insulting the speaker
yes I saw the horrified looks on your
faces even through the glare of these
spotlights so this is how so many
introverts feel about the team-building
exercises we are forever obliged to
participate in now I was really lucky I
got to spend and I got to spend seven
years in splendid solitude writing a
book called
quiet the power of introverts in a world
that can&#39;t stop talking and when it
published I thought that I would give my
TED talk and I could go home for seven
years and write another book but the
talk touched a nerve and thousands and
thousands of strangers started reaching
out and sharing their own stories of
accepting their introversion for the
first time and those stories changed the
course of my life so I&#39;m going to tell
you all about that but first I want to
share just a few of these stories ok um
high school junior in Kansas who was
desperately trying to twist herself into
a pretzel trying to be a leader but she
was kicked off her high school&#39;s
prestigious leadership squad because she
wasn&#39;t outgoing enough she was so
devastated but she told me that she saw
the TED talk and it reminded her what
she actually would have preferred to do
in the first place which was science and
so her version of leadership turned out
to be publishing her for a scientific
paper at seventeen winning a huge
university scholarship and today she&#39;s a
happy freshman majoring in biomedical
engineering yeah
okay there was an ivy-league president
there was a fortune 500 CEO and a Marine
Corps general all of whom confessed to
me that introversion was their secret
and their secret strengths there was a
quiet teacher who somehow managed to
convince her entire school to rethink
its emphasis on class participation and
endless group projects and there was
even a lonely young guy who decided not
to commit suicide because he finally
realized there was a place for him in
this world and today believe it or not
he&#39;s happy he&#39;s productive he&#39;s in a
loving marriage so it turns out that
embracing their quiet nature does not
cause introverts to flee to a shack in
the woods it empowers them to embrace
the world but to do it for the first
time on their own terms now ironically
these stories had the same effect on me
I found myself every morning with my
laptop thinking about all these souls
and writing not the first sentences of
my next book but the blueprint for a
quiet revolution that&#39;s what I want to
talk to you about and then it went on
and I started joining forces with a
growing army of quiet revolutionaries
many of whom by the way are extroverts
with quiet colleagues and spouses and
kids of their own and together we have
just formed a venture-backed mission
based company whose goal is to empower
introverts for the benefit of us all
thank you that&#39;s a third to a half of
humanity one out of every two or three
people you know is introverted so we&#39;re
dreaming really big and I want to just
give you in the interest of time the
quickest look at three of the many big
projects on our drawing board okay first
transforming office architecture
solitude is a crucial ingredient of
innovation and even of leadership and we
want to bring it back to the workplace
two years ago at Ted just after I gave
my talk I met with a lovely guy and a
self-described introvert named Jim
Hackett who you all had a chance to meet
last night and now Jim at the time was
the CEO of Steelcase the company who of
course helped design the beautiful Ted
mainstage and he told me that for years
he had been worried about the growing
erosion of focus and privacy in modern
offices and of course we had been
worrying about the same thing and been
pretty vocal about it so fast forward
two years
we have now formed a partnership with
steel case to bring quiet spaces to open
offices so now workers can move freely
back and forth between private and
social spaces as they wish and in fact
thank you
and in fact Jim Hackett I believe and
his successor CEO Jim keen who are two
of the most inspiring quiet leaders I
know are here right now do you guys want
to maybe raise your hands next hmm
helping organizations train the next
generation of quiet leaders you know
many of the world&#39;s great leaders are
quiet and in fact some of them are here
right now people like Bill Gates and
general McChrystal are introverts we
want to be creating a whole lot more of
them so we are building a quiet
Leadership Institute to Train introverts
to lead communicate connect by drawing
on their own natural strengths instead
of asking them to turn into extroverts
now two years ago thanks to the power of
Ted I now have this unlikely career as a
public speaker and and I go around the
world talking to every conceivable type
of organization and you know who I found
gets the potential of quiet leaders
better than anyone the military the
military where leadership is a matter of
life and death and everybody knows that
many of the great leaders are introverts
so so excited today to announce that the
quiet Leadership Institute is going to
be led by a wonderful guy named Mike
Erwin he is a decorated veteran two-time
Bronze Star winner
he&#39;s a professor of leadership and
positive psychology at West Point and a
very fierce quiet revolutionary okay
third empowering quiet children the most
poignant letters I get the ones that
haunt me come from children who are
hurting because the well-meaning adults
in their lives asked them why can&#39;t you
be a little bit more like your outgoing
sister and they know that they can&#39;t be
and they never will be and the letters
come to from parents who are hurting
because they hear repeatedly a
parent-teacher conferences that their
child&#39;s pretty great but would be so
much better
if only he were that precious thing more
talkative in class hundreds of schools
thousands of teachers have been reaching
out to us class
ringg for change so in the year ahead we
are going to be partnering with schools
to develop tools for parents and
teachers to harness the talents of quiet
children one final story there once was
a boy who was so quiet and shy he used
to run home from school as soon as the
bell rang to avoid socializing with his
classmates an SS boy grew older he
learned how to speak out on their behalf
hey this British boy sighted
instinctively with the oppressed and an
Fe grew older he learned how to speak
out on their behalf but he remained
always a shy and quiet man believing
that these traits were his greatest
source of strength the boy&#39;s name was
Mohandas Gandhi and he later uttered for
me the most important sentences in human
history in a gentle way you can shake
the world so whether you&#39;re an introvert
or an extrovert I invite you to join our
revolution and I invite you to consider
really that empowering the introverted
half of the population is going to
benefit us all but most of all I invite
you to go out and shake the world gently
thank you very much
you
