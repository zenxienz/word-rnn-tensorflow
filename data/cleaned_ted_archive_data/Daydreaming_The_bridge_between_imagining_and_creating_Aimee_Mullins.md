let&#39;s move on to - Amy - Amy Mullins
who&#39;s up next and we have a little video
I believe - roll about Aimee Mullins and
if we could pull the video please it&#39;s
born without fibulas in both legs
I was amputated aged one and I&#39;ve been
running like hell ever since
however fit all over the place I was
speaking to a group of about 300 kids
ages 6 to 8 at a Children&#39;s Museum and I
brought with me a bag full of legs
similar to the kinds of things you see
up here and had them laid out on a table
for the kids and from my experience you
know kids are naturally curious about
what they don&#39;t know or don&#39;t understand
or as far into them they only learn to
be frightened of those differences when
an adult influences them to behave that
way
I just pictured a first-grade teacher
out in the lobby with these unruly kids
saying now whatever you do don&#39;t stare
at her legs when of course that&#39;s the
point that&#39;s why I was there I wanted to
invite them to look and explore now we
will welcome the incomparable Aimee
Mullins
[Applause]
chipmunk cheeks Oh
daydreaming most people think it&#39;s just
idle reverie a lapse and attention but
what if it&#39;s actually the habitual
practice of imagining the practice of
ignoring our current boundaries of
reality and disregarding on purpose what
we&#39;ve been told makes sense obviously I
was always a big day dreamer in
elementary school my report cards had
two columns one for grades and one for
attitude I had good grades but routinely
I got minus signs in the attitude column
and the teacher comments went something
like this
amy is never really with us amy is
always somewhere else or she is a
chronic daydreamer like it was a
contagious medical condition so
essentially I was getting A&#39;s but I was
scolded for how I arrived at them and I
was made to feel ashamed for how my mind
works how I solved problems and absorbed
information and it took me a long time
to really own the way my mind work and
stop apologizing for how it engages with
the world most of you here know me for
being able to design parts of my body
but the genesis of that was in
harnessing what happened regularly in my
mind as a child designing and
redesigning an identity which usually
had nothing to do with what other people
expected it would be I spent a lot of
time in children&#39;s hospitals and when I
couldn&#39;t actually leave the hospital bed
with two full plaster casts on I used
day dreaming as a tool to become an
explorer I traveled in my head I honed
my ability to imagine other times and
places in great detail places I&#39;d never
been to so as a four-year-old I was
flying around on a magic carpet across
the Great Pyramids of Egypt I was I was
just in with the knights of the round
table I was telling that to a friend the
other day and she was like oh
yeah yeah I loved that whole maiden in
the tower daydream when I was a kid I
was like no I wasn&#39;t the girl locked in
the tower I was the guy on the horse
rescuing the girl on the tower I was the
knight obviously I mean scientists tell
us that these daydreams are self
generated is fascinating they emerge on
their own not from what we perceive so
they&#39;re unique to each of us we each
have this wellspring of visions inside
us that gives us access to the essence
of who we are but we also have that
ability to create other versions of
ourselves that explore different ways of
being I&#39;ve never actually felt the
ground beneath my feet
but I&#39;ve wiggled my toes I have flexed
my ankles and yeah I say ouch when
someone steps on my feet I do those
things are so known in my daydreams that
when they do become real I will already
have experienced them day dreaming is
different than night dreaming in that
you&#39;re claiming autonomy over what you
can envision when we&#39;re kids have the
only place we have autonomy is in our
own minds we need to nurture a
guilt-free environment where our
children can daydream and you know while
we&#39;re at it let&#39;s abandon our proclivity
to tell kids not to get their hopes up
or to be realistic when they&#39;re
imagining what they might do or or who
they might become and instead let&#39;s
foster an atmosphere where we&#39;re free to
be highly improbable and wildly
unrealistic in our goal-setting none of
my best adventures many of them
documented here at Ted over the last 16
years have materialized
because I&#39;ve been realistic I didn&#39;t
have a clear path that was carved out
for me so things that had never existed
before had to become real in here before
they ever had a chance to to become
possible in the eyes of anyone else
I designed my future by daydreaming it
we can act on our imagination by
daydreaming it&#39;s the bridge between
imagining and creating daydreaming helps
us see a path where the unknown the
unexperienced or the unreal becomes
seeing known and ultimately much closer
to being real creativity is imagination
actualized the dreamers who act are
lauded we call them visionaries pioneers
trailblazers and that ability to do what
they dream is seen as special or unique
but it&#39;s not unique it&#39;s just practiced
we come into this world innately able to
imagine in daydreams but as we become
adults we often stop ourselves from
having them I mean we&#39;re reporting on
our current realities more often than
we&#39;re imagining better ones so let&#39;s
make daydreaming a choice not an
accident we can and should habituate it
and practice it like it&#39;s a sport or any
other skill that requires a commitment
of time I&#39;m Stein claimed to have begun
his theory of relativity while
daydreaming regularly about running
alongside a sunbeam to the edge of the
universe now I have no idea what that
image has to do with math and science
but it worked for him because he allowed
himself the daydreaming time to explore
it TE Lawrence all men dream but not
equally those who dream by night in the
dusty recesses of their minds waken the
day to find that it was manatee but the
dreamers of the day are dangerous men
for they may act on their dreams with
open eyes to make them possible now
that&#39;s the kind of dangerous we should
all get behind next
[Applause]
