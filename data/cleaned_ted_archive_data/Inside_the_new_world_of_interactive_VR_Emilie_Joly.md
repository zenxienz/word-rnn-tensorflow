so virtual reality is kind of an
unappealing technology we&#39;re asking
users to put a huge helmet on their head
and move around with very little notion
for their physical space we&#39;ve all seen
it we are users they look at best silly
but to me it is one of the most
inspiring technologies today I am deeply
interested in how we can create and use
technology to create an emotional
connection between impossible worlds we
are at the threshold of a new world of
immersive storytelling and with the
first headsets coming out in a couple of
months it&#39;s safe to imagine that in not
too long they&#39;re clunkiness will have
diminished and will have access to new
type of stories that are no longer
controlled by the storyteller but by the
user and with my team we developed those
impossible worlds as interaction
designers we want to create an
experience that is not a film it&#39;s not
really a game it&#39;s really something new
and this is how we came up with our our
project sequenced I want to introduce
you to Mike on stage so that we can show
you what it&#39;s about so welcome Mike
so sequenced is deeply inspired by
Japanese animation it&#39;s an adventure on
360 degrees the story is set in the near
future borders have collapsed resources
are missing and societies are slowly
rebuilding themselves a key character in
the story is called Raven she&#39;s a 13
year old girl living in the desert and
she&#39;s going to make an unexpected
discovery about her origins and the
story is going to unfold on various
episodes the novelty in stories like
sequenced is that all the characters and
all the environments are aware of your
presence so they literally react to you
looking at them so if for example Mike&#39;s
looks up we should see Raven flying
around there she is and she&#39;s going to
land behind one of the trees so this
event it&#39;s not pre-scripted it&#39;s really
happening because he&#39;s looking and then
if he goes back to her hiding somewhere
behind a tree she&#39;s going to come down
and start talking to the other character
what&#39;s that big machine just the
transport then every scene can go many
different ways so if for example Mike&#39;s
Mike turns around and start looking at
the red flying device the characters are
also going to start talking about it and
the story is going to go into that
branch what does the Red Stick tell you
that the water is acid I knew that the
water doesn&#39;t shine in the same way we
know things in different ways and so
there are more than 50 triggers inside
one single scene so
my guess you wouldn&#39;t really notice on
the first screen again imma you have to
like watch the story again and again to
see all the different possibilities
scanner and principle we use the same
triggering mechanism for sound so for
example if there are multiple
conversations happening at the same time
we&#39;re using audio triggers so that you
can focus on what the character is
saying or what the sound is so the sound
goes louder it&#39;s the good example is
serious if you&#39;re in a party and there&#39;s
a lot of noise and you&#39;re trying to
focus on what somebody is talking about
so it&#39;s kind of the same idea I&#39;ve
always believed them what we&#39;re doing is
building the basic tools that are needed
to create interactivity in VR and this
new medium Marcus is going to be so
excited well thanks Mike thanks
vir has really this unique power to
physically throw you into another
dimension it&#39;s the first medium in which
the screen completely disappears think
how crazy this is the possibilities are
really endless we tend to focus on the
technology and on the interface but this
is really about presence the story takes
you down one of a series of different
paths and the story adapts automatically
it&#39;s taking you down surprising places
depending on your emotions or your
interest so don&#39;t pay too much attention
to the clunky helmet because that&#39;s
going to change and all the stories
they&#39;re going to be amazing thank you
