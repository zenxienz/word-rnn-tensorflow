thank you guys so much and I do have to
say that it&#39;s all rumbling that you do
said that&#39;s getting us up blasting into
space have you ever seen a NASA rocket
launch it&#39;s usually doing that just what
you did and so I&#39;ll take you on a
journey some of those thousands new
world that we imagined but that we
actually found already I was in the sky
you go out at night you see a couple of
styles and starts if you have a look at
the night sky but that&#39;s only a fraction
of the billions of stars we actually
have in our galaxy alone and so this is
a picture of our galaxies billions stars
in our galaxy alone and out there we
have billions of galaxies so this
incredible number of stars out there and
with the last NASA nice emissions what
we found is that around every fifth of
those stars out there there is actually
a planet that&#39;s small enough so it could
be a rock and it&#39;s just at the right
distance that is not too hot or too cold
so that there could be liquid water what
we think you&#39;d also need for life out
there so there are thousands to billions
of planets out there and how do we find
them what you saw before is a huge milky
way and what I wanted to show you there
is that actually we only probing a tiny
tiny bit of our solar neighborhood and
we found thousands of planets already
and this is to show you how we find them
because there are tiny you take the
earth put them next to each other 100
earth is the size of our own son so it&#39;s
tiny if you look up at night you see the
spot of life the star but you won&#39;t see
the planet we need huge telescopes to do
that and that&#39;s the next generation of
telescopes but for now have a look at
the animation
there if the planet goes around the star
the star actually wobbles so basically
the planet moves around the star and the
Sterling&#39;s back because the gravitation
of the planet packs of the star and so
the plot the star moves back and forth
and you can see that in the stellar life
pretty much similar to when an ambulance
comes and goes away from you the sound
changes the Doppler effect you can do
this for life as well and so the star
moves towards you away from you and this
is how you figure out that a planet goes
around it and what you also see if by
chance we look at it the right way the
planning goes between us and its fur it
blocks part of this really hot Stella
surface so the star Bharata CLE gets
dimmer and this is how you can figure
out how big the planet is that goes in
front of that star and so it&#39;s much
easier can find the big start planets
out there but if you make a graph and
this is what I see when you see here on
the bottom is the radius of the planet
how big it is and here on the right is
how many we found out there and don&#39;t
worry about the numbers but you see
Jupiter sitting at around ten Earth
radii here and the earth sitting around
one and what you see is that there are
so many more of these small planets out
there and when the planet goes in front
of the star as you see here the
sterilized gets dimmer but part of the
sterilized gets filtered through the
atmosphere of the planet and that allows
us to read the atmosphere figure out
what&#39;s in the air of that planet over
light-years away so we can&#39;t do if you
want to kind of weather forecast for
planets around other Suns what is pretty
exciting because we can&#39;t really get
there yet and I&#39;m counting on all of you
guys to figure something out how we can
do space travel a little bit better and
also to help me have a look at these
plants and discover explore these other
worlds because we have thousands of them
so I hope
a couple of you actually going to do
this for a living well this is really
where you get right you get a tiny tiny
spot of light and space because these
planets has so far away if we shrink our
whole solar system to the science of an
Oreo cookie the next star is two
football fields away and that&#39;s the next
star and we&#39;re talking about billions of
stars so basically you get a tiny speck
of light out there and what you do you
hopefully did in school already you
basically use a prism to cut it up in
its own colors the white light off the
planet gets cut up within its colors and
then you can actually read the intensity
in each of these colors and that tells
you what kind of error is on that planet
makes a spectral fingerprint and here
you see the one for the earth that has
oxygen water and also reducing ass mess
and that is the spectral fingerprint for
life and of course the earth was
different through geological time and
here&#39;s just a couple of things when life
started and how new we are but that gets
reflected in the spectral fingerprint
what kind of life you have on this
planet maybe even intelligent life and
what kind of environment air is up there
and so we learn about our own planet by
doing that we learn about other earth
and basically this is how this spectral
changes and really one of the things we
wanted to learn about past present and
future of yours and hopefully find
signature of other life on this planet
and so I hope you guys a couple of you
guys are going to help us out in the
future I&#39;ll miss thank you so much
[Applause]
