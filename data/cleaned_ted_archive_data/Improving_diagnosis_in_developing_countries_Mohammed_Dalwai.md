triage can save lives you see it&#39;s a
simple process that happens everywhere
around the world as patients walking to
any emergency center I like a 42 year
old gentleman that walks into a rural
clinic in South Africa where I used to
work he comes in with chest pain he&#39;s
anxious and scared and the emergency
room is busy but he would still have to
undergo a system of triage which means
asking a standard set of questions doing
his vital signs adding it to a
mathematical school and then if needed
during an essential investigation like
an ECG electrocardiogram afterwards he
will get a final color red indicating
critically ill or green maybe not so bad
the problem is that we are getting
cleared wrong in the developing world
maybe because we have limited resources
sometimes we have two nurses and one
doctor looking after hundreds of
patients sometimes we fail to ask to
send a set of questions for every single
patient sometimes we make mistakes was a
mathematical score because retired
because we human sometimes we forget to
do the essential task like an ECG I&#39;m a
South African emergency medical doctor
and I&#39;ve worked with Doctors Without
Borders in emergency centers all around
the world and I&#39;ve seen these mistakes
I&#39;ve seen a 22 year old woman died in
Pakistan because she was bleeding
internally and we made a mistake with
three other incorrectly in South Africa
1 million people are triaged every
single year in the Western Cape alone
one in every four patients are
incorrectly triage
which means people are dying in our
waiting room triage was broken and we
have to solve this problem together with
a team of health care workers designers
and developers we form the open medicine
project and we created a mobile
application that could effectively and
efficiently triage patients one that
will go through the standard set of
questions every single time one that
would calculate the mathematical score
for you as you went through and added
the vital signs and one that would alert
the healthcare worker to additional
investigations that would have to be
done in 2013 we implemented this in one
of the busiest emergency centers of the
western cape and in a small study showed
a staggering eighty-eight percent
improvement in triage completion which
means we started getting 30 drives for
the first time which means less patients
were dying in our waiting room we are
now in the final negotiation stages of
rolling massage across 25 facilities in
South Africa but then as we move forward
we started realizing something for the
first time we had electronic data
unclear something that we&#39;ve never had
before and we could start doing things
that we&#39;ve never been able to do before
like increasing diagnostic capability so
if you look at something simple like our
fate systolic blood pressure and you put
them together you could get something
called a shock index which is a
sensitive clinical indicator to help
doctors for example identify patients
that had internal bleeding but otherwise
look well then we started looking at
other data like how many patients we
were seeing what days of the week they
were coming in and how sick they were
based on acreage color you can in start
looking at let your limited resources
and how best to effectively utilize
those resources and then picture this
picture the Cheerios application at the
beginning of every emergency center
across the continent pulling simple data
into a dashboard you could incite seen
for instance children under 5 in Central
African Republic that is presented with
watery diarrhea you could come in from a
specific clinical village you could
start reaction being proactive rather
than reactive and send us the team
before hundreds of patients die and then
think about West Africa and everything
that&#39;s been happening in West Africa at
the moment simple 30 later like high
temperatures and bleeding coming from a
specific clinic village or town and Risa
Scott seen possibly alerting us to an
outbreak before it happens like Ebola
you see before we never had this
information this is information that we
took days weeks months to get to us if
it ever got to us at all and we would
never be able to be proactive now for
the first time we could possibly do this
what I&#39;m talking about is the real time
epidemiology through the simple process
of triage thank you very much
[Applause]
so just a couple of questions I remember
the old way because I&#39;m obsessed with
like biological thrillers and stuff I
look I love that stuff that people would
you know a couple months would go by and
all of a sudden in the cdc&#39;s morbidity
and mortality report that would be like
cluster of deaths in Angola with vague
information and maybe somebody would go
there but they&#39;re always so far behind
what was really going on this is you&#39;re
basically saying that you could easily
have this data be coming in from all
these clinics and then roll up and you
have algorithms which will kind of flag
and say you know temperature lots of
kids with high temperature in this
village let&#39;s figure out what that is
and go to attack it immediately and
potentially if you had an Ebola outbreak
in the future you could try to contain
it a lot faster than it was is that
right yes so instead of tracking this
you can I insects symptoms which then
allow you to react much faster and even
if you just found the clinic and say
okay what&#39;s happening is the
contaminated water source easy something
going on in your community and it allows
us to be a again like I said proactive
rather than reactive so what&#39;s again you
guys are implementing it at your clinic
you know your hospital now and you&#39;re
rolling it out regionally I think we
said 25 or so plotting more what&#39;s it
going to take to put that let&#39;s just say
Africa while eyes wide what kind of
resources do you need to do that you
need money technological expertise
cooperation of big organizations I think
it&#39;s better to do it with small
organizations probably but but now that
I apply us but no seriously what do you
need to make this real well we obviously
need buying from the government we also
need buy-in from the smaller clinics we
would need the resources and funding to
be able to roll it out we&#39;ve actually
released the application for free on the
iPad store as well as the google android
store and now we are developing it
further so that that&#39;s free version you
could then download straight to your
clinic and start working technology
itself is not expensive it&#39;s all known
stuff its databases basically exactly
and by allowing page
healthcare workers to have the power to
be able to impact patient care I think
that&#39;s the key element that we want to
be able to do to me it&#39;s amazing that
you started at improving tree up triage
providing decision support to help
really tired nurses not accidentally
make a mistake and then all of a sudden
you get to real-time public health and
epidemiology I&#39;m pretty psyched about
what you&#39;re doing thanks so much thank
you
