I was 18 months old when the foster care
system placed me in an upscale home in
New York City&#39;s Queens neighborhood it
had all the marks of wealth prestige and
affluence I was placed in a home where
the arms of loving parents private
schools and weekends at the shore should
have awaited me instead I came
face-to-face with unspeakable acts of
abuse shaming slapping neglect and more
I struggled to fit in with other
children at school I was different and I
had more than one secret to keep one
fateful day at the age of 14 I disclosed
to my foster parent I was not like the
other boys I was transgender my foster
mother&#39;s response was they kicked me out
of the home to save the other children
from what she calls the devil&#39;s creation
I became one more nameless throw away
one more statistic to add to the growing
2.5 million homeless LGBT youth in
America for me it wasn&#39;t easy undergoing
gender transition as a freshman while
secretly being homeless and living on
New York City subways I didn&#39;t have
support I didn&#39;t have anyone when I then
went on to high school I understood that
the only thing that would be tangible in
my life would be my education but see
for me at 14 it&#39;s not what it looked
like for the average youth it wasn&#39;t
taking my clothes out it wasn&#39;t making
sure that my mom or dad would check my
homework and say you&#39;re doing a great
job instead it was walking just about a
mile up and down Christopher Street and
hope to get clients how to get a meal
and transportation money to even get to
school that&#39;s the reality that many LGBT
youth are facing in this country it&#39;s
the very reality that many
I woke up saying to myself what did you
do to deserve this I&#39;m human like
everyone else
I don&#39;t deserve pain I don&#39;t deserve
trauma why couldn&#39;t I have gotten the
mom that would love me but then I
realized that a transformative moment in
my life that it was not about who was
willing to accept me was are willing to
accept myself and was I going to accept
myself in the way that my peers told me
not to because see my journey began
wrapping t-shirts on my head because I
couldn&#39;t afford expensive wigs and
because that was my truth I was really
cute and physically attacked by the guys
and girls in my school and so after
leaving I said to myself I&#39;m so sorry
I said to myself that you can&#39;t give up
because you&#39;re gonna give up in ways
that I can see it could be very easy to
it&#39;s not easy to walk in your truth it&#39;s
not easy to be different because my
different is the kind of difference that
people feel they have the right to tell
you that you do not deserve to live see
my struggle with gender transition
getting through high school but the
average transgender youth struggle is
where to say what does safety look like
what does my family look like because
they rebut me I rebuttal myself see now
I know you&#39;re seeing me here and you&#39;re
saying well something had to get better
at some point in your life you chose not
only not to give up but to thrive to be
the best person you can be
and it started at Christopher Street
here I look to the water and it was the
water that liberated me it was the water
that I could envision privilege
happiness and success
I seen my struggles pass me by and as
they passed me by I was reminded of the
people that had no clue what people like
myself were going through and so today I
want you to know that when you see me I
am NOT which engine to look like I&#39;m
just a courageous person who dares to be
different they&#39;re very different that we
all are here today they&#39;re very
different that we are reminded of every
single day when we walk out of our home
and see other people&#39;s reality after
graduating high school and going on to
Rochester New York I then started my own
foundation Jenna global after starting
Jenna global
I have a national ambassador ship with
the Human Rights Campaign
after the National ambassadorship with
the humans rights campaign I then got
one of the most amazing news I could
have ever gotten in my life that we had
won the Emmy Award for the T word
documentary and when you see me crying
can you see me shaken up right now it&#39;s
because I know how many of my sisters
will never make it here how many of them
has lost their lives and so right when
this sounds like the it gets better we
cannot forget about the road in front of
us I&#39;m not acting for this to be a sad
story I&#39;m actually you to see someone
standing here and they&#39;re paying and
their truth and actors that what can you
do and when you say what can I do
it&#39;s joining the revolution of loving
and accepting someone different because
different is the new frontier and if you
can&#39;t do it for me do it for the people
who&#39;s dying in August 2015 three
transgender women of color were reported
murdered in one day many reports come in
every single month one of our main
battlegrounds is to exist in a world
where everyone says you&#39;re trying to be
someone you&#39;re not and the only thing
you&#39;re doing is living as yourself
I needed they need it we need the love
we need the liberation we need to
support not only for the 2.5 million
homeless LGBT youth but for the 41
percent of transgender people that
attend suicide for the ever-growing
numbers of not just murdered but of the
families rejecting would maybe the most
amazing thing in your family which is
the catalyst to different it&#39;s not
living in the norms it&#39;s breaking them
and so I say will you join it do you
want to join it
thank you
