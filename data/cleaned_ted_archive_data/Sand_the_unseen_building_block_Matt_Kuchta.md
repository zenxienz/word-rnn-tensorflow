so I&#39;m a geologist I love sand Sam tells
me all sorts of things about how that
material is deposited what kinds of
things were going on in Earth&#39;s past but
at the same time Sam it&#39;s gorgeous
it&#39;s got all sorts of colors and shapes
patterns as many kinds of patterns and
sand as there are places to find sand
finding sand well that&#39;s easy
here&#39;s a picture long&#39;s peak Rocky
Mountain Park in Colorado it&#39;s a sand
factory it&#39;s taking the rock that makes
up the Earth&#39;s crust and breaking it
into smaller pieces
ice water wind even glaciers plants are
breaking these rocks down into little
pieces little pieces of sand that might
start wandering their way down the river
somewhere eventually finding their way
to the ocean
rocket the ocean might be battered and
bashed and smashed into smaller sand
grains there too sand is everywhere we
can find it in all sorts of places but
one of the things that I really like
about sand is that we use it every day
even though we don&#39;t think about it in
the concrete that makes up our roads and
our highways our buildings all the
computer stuff that we use on a daily
basis
silicon most sand contains a lot of
silicon camera sensors computer chips
our society is essentially built on sand
and stuff made from sand window-glass
right we can see outside we can make
green causes to grow plants because of
sand
traction where I come from up in
Wisconsin roads get icy in the winter we
throw sand on the sidewalks in the road
so that we don&#39;t slip around as much
freight train ease they spray sand on
the rails to help provide traction and
if any of you have ever built a
sandcastle
you know that sand is a really good
building material right it&#39;s everywhere
it&#39;s widespread and well it&#39;s dirt cheap
but if you&#39;ve ever built a sandcastle
you realize that not all sand castles
work out very well sand has some
problems so I&#39;ve got some high-speed
video of a bowling ball falling on top
of a sand castle
slow down about 30 times so one of the
things that you can see is it a wooden
ball it&#39;s falling downwards the sand
castle used to be here now it went that
way so let&#39;s take this video and let&#39;s
pull it apart see what&#39;s going on if we
look at the forces involved maybe we can
understand what makes sand castles work
and how we can make them better so here
we&#39;re just going to take three grains of
sand because that&#39;s a lot easier to keep
track of them the you know million or so
that were in that sand castle
drop a bowling ball on it well that
bowling ball is gonna exert a force
downwards it&#39;s gonna push the sand
grains below out to the sides so the
only thing holding those sand grains and
keeping them from going out there is
friction unless we add a little water
right if we add a little water that
surface tension what keeps water in the
little droplets what makes it stick to
things helps add some tension offset
that force pushing them apart but even
water&#39;s surface tension doesn&#39;t work all
that well if that&#39;s a really heavy
weight like a bowling ball so let&#39;s take
something
and put it in between the grains of sand
maybe a piece of fabric something that
has some strength in tension so if we
pull on it it will pull back and now we
have enough forces pulling back in
holding those grains together so that
when the weight tries to push them apart
they won&#39;t move so I&#39;ve got another
sandcastle I&#39;m gonna drop bowling ball
on it we&#39;re gonna watch it in slow
motion but instead of just sand I put in
four sheets of just standard window
screen into that sandcastle Pacbell nice
and tight together watch what happens
don&#39;t blink
yeah Wow all right you could stand on
this thing it&#39;s a super sandcastle now
keep in mind if you&#39;re doing that South
Beach and you&#39;ve got sheets a window
screen everywhere bring them back when
you&#39;re done hit clean up after yourself
but boy you should see the look on
people&#39;s faces when they see you
standing on top of a sandcastle
it&#39;s pretty cool all right well this
technology is not something new it&#39;s not
something I just invented we&#39;ve been
using this for over 50 years it&#39;s a
material that we know is called geo
fabric but even though we&#39;ve kind of
been using our geo fabrics for the last
50 years or so it&#39;s not a new technology
ancient Mesopotamians were using this to
build their structures over 3,000 years
ago parts of the Great Wall of China
have the same kind of geo fabric made
mostly of reeds and dried grass woven
together in a sheet they&#39;re engineering
with geo fabrics well now it is when we
want soil to be strong we can compact it
together and layer in these geo fabrics
to help support whatever might be on top
of the soil which got me thinking for an
outer space right we&#39;re traveling to a
distant planet somewhere and we&#39;re on
that somewhere far away moon and we&#39;re
looking well imagine that bowling balls
a micro meteorite hitting the surface of
that planet right to protect our space
habitat we didn&#39;t need to take a lot of
really heavy expensive materials but if
we bring some lightweight geo fabric and
use the sand that we find on the planet
just maybe we in solve some problems
save some money and explore new worlds
so the next time you see some sand
remember it&#39;s important here you sure as
heck know it&#39;s gonna be important when
we go to another planet thank you very
much
