thanks Tom for emotionally preparing the
audience for my outfit and it&#39;s every
comedians dream to follow up a talk on
how to save dying babies so that makes
me feel really good
does here&#39;s the deal guys
we have this really annoying racism
bigotry and Islamophobia problem in this
country if you ask me the best way to
deal with it is to make white people
laugh now I know your first question is
why white people right that&#39;s a really
good question and the reason why white
people is because they control a lot of
institutions like the government the
economy outer space AMC&#39;s Mad Men and
TED talks
so now like most of you I&#39;m an
iranian-american Muslim female comedian
and we&#39;re we&#39;re really good at
communication so I&#39;ve developed a series
of guidelines on how to make white
people laugh okay now the first one is
change the stereotype now if you&#39;re from
Belgium you&#39;re known for delicious
waffles if you&#39;re from Brazil you&#39;re
known for big breasted women who wear
and sell fruit if you&#39;re from Iran
you&#39;re known for Iranian uranium
enrichment now this last example is not
edible if you&#39;re from a country where
the stereotype is not edible you need to
change the stereotype okay I wrote a
show called bootleg Islam and in this
show I tried to equate Iran with
eggplants because Iran ian&#39;s don&#39;t give
a about uranium but they have a
super duper hard-on for eggplants okay
it&#39;s true so throughout the show I&#39;m
sorry I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t mean to elevate
the discourse that way I feel like said
some more you don&#39;t understand too big
now throughout the show I chronicled my
relationship with eggplants and I don&#39;t
want to talk about what happened that
night um and by the end of the show
instead of calling me a dirty Iranian
terrorist people were calling me a dirty
Iranian eggplant lover it&#39;s a market
improvement now
the next rule of thumb is don&#39;t be
afraid to talk about politics okay
politics are the burqa clad elephant in
the room you have to talk about them to
defuse the tension all right so I wrote
a show called the israeli-palestinian
conflict Oh romantic comedy it tracks
the conflict back to a one-night stand
that happens between Israel and
Palestine at the 1948 Geneva Convention
which as we all know was a really
convention
and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a two-person musical
there&#39;s also animation throughout and
here&#39;s a sample of that animation what
happens when Israel and Palestine first
meet
[Music]
that&#39;s right it was really beautiful
the next rule of thumb is to get up into
people&#39;s faces but do it in a delightful
way so myself and comedian Dean
Obeidallah when took a bunch of Muslim
American comedians and we run around the
country to places like Alabama
Mississippi Arizona Georgia places where
they love the mozzies and and we did
stand-up shows and we called the tour
the Muslims are coming right which some
people thought was like a preventative
warning lecture on the coming Muslim
apocalypse they were very confused when
it was just a stand-up show when we
weren&#39;t doing shows we would go into the
middle of town squares and set up and
ask a Muslim booth where people could
come and ask us questions questions like
why are you wearing so much cleavage now
the and the next rule of thumb is get
some non-threatening allies ie other
white people okay and we documented the
Muslims are coming tour for a feature
film that&#39;s coming out later this year
and we got some allies to talk in a
movie about Muslims here&#39;s a sampling of
who they are and a summary of what they
said Muslims Muslims Muslim millions and
millions of Muslims Islam gay the gays
and Muslims my name is John I&#39;m a Jew
Islam Islam Islam there&#39;s no God you
fool
Muslims now in conclusion
as you can see from this graph the more
jokes you tell on the x-axis okay
the better white people feel on the
y-axis I know this is a really
complicated graph for you guys but as
you can tell there&#39;s like a slight dip
after joke number four and I think you
guys even remember you guys were a
little weird after joke number four on
that for this guy but don&#39;t worry
because it goes right back up and also
don&#39;t worry because this graph is
totally made up
now if telling jokes isn&#39;t your thing
that&#39;s totally fine you can just go out
and hug a Muslim make a baked good for
an immigrant get wasted with someone you
don&#39;t know and as long as we&#39;re taping
it white people happy they&#39;re less
likely to start wars so thank you that&#39;s
all
[Applause]
