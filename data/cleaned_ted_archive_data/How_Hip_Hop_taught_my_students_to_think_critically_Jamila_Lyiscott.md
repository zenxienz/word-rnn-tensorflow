every semester that I teach pre-service
and in-service educators on topics
ranging from diversity to racial justice
to literacy acquisition in urban schools
I make sure to include a unit on the art
of the cipher but those who don&#39;t know
over 80 percent of urban educators are
not people of color and live outside of
the racially diverse communities where
their students reside so I bring in the
cypher a practice within hip-hop culture
with West African roots essentially it&#39;s
a circle of people who come together to
share an extemporaneous freestyle or
newly written ideas over a beat the goal
is to exhibit mastery lyrical and
rhetorical dexterity sometimes using the
African diasporic tradition of
signifying so every semester for some
years now I&#39;ve taught these fundamental
skills of hip-hop writing so that these
educators dare participate in the art of
the cypher and every semester I
witnessed the same exact patterns during
the lesson in a nutshell terror and fear
the beat is in the background and as I
watch the hesitation and anxiety in the
roll reach a boiling point on lower the
music to invite some truth honest
reflection about what is being felt
vulnerability fear of failure discomfort
about being inauthentic my line suck
these are some of the feelings that are
agreed upon in the room it is at this
point when I can see the anxious
excitement of some and fair and shame in
the eyes of others that I ask how many
of your students do you label illiterate
by societal standards while they can
demonstrate mastery over this complex
cognitive form that intimidates you in
this cypher how inauthentic it must feel
for them to participate in a culture
that regards their own as inferior I
tell this 81%
therefore marginalized people a truly
diverse society is not about simply
participating in dominant culture I tell
them that I am a repository of
transnational conflict
have you ever endured the duplicity of
feeling like both victim and convict
have you ever enjoy the shame of in a
classroom mixing your words with your
thoughts like Professor this all the
reports that sometimes hegemonic forces
are forced to use the Gries of
fabrication and I&#39;ll be thinking the
same thing so I don&#39;t know why they&#39;d be
hating this may sound like just another
case of broken English but I&#39;ll be as
broken as the rector&#39;s of our history so
I&#39;ll be that broken be that broken
record can you see my lines I tell them
that the process I tell them that the
process towards diversity is not just
about the presence of difference it is
about creating spaces and opportunities
for truly esteeming and exploring the
value of difference on its own terms you
see the problem with standard forms is
not that we are incapable of acquiring
them is that they so often fail to
incorporate the genius that is available
within diverse cultures and if I am
forced to be you and I am robbed and you
are robbed of the fullest potential
of me
