seven years ago I found myself alone on
a train in North Korea facing four
soldiers it&#39;s like did the people off
like the experience was really scary I
was like they&#39;re thinking about oh my
god what&#39;s going to happen to me I was
being questioned and the other
passengers have been told to get off the
train this was my first trip to
Pyongyang today I still ask myself what
am i doing in this place
I found it and ran a nonprofit called
chosen exchange and we trained North
Korean entrepreneurs we bring volunteers
to lead workshops in the country and we
select the best candidates in North
Korea to bring them overseas for further
training and incubation programs often
when we think of this place I&#39;m sure you
guys was wondering entrepreneurs North
Korea how can this word spit together in
a sentence when I think of North Korea
often this probably does the image you
have in your mind or maybe you think
about refugees as you rightly should or
just maybe you might be thinking of this
guy it&#39;s this place is a very unique
place I remember kind of my first trip
there and I was like wondering you know
kind of what were these people thinking
what do they want to do and I think the
one thing that&#39;s kept me really coming
back to this place is the experience of
meeting North Koreans who see the world
in an individual way so give an example
you know on my first trip there I met a
lady who told me that she wanted to be a
female business leader for me this was a
very individual aspiration on another
trip I met a lady who told me that she
wanted to be in the 3% as her 3% of what
and she said the 3% of female CEOs who
run fortune 500 companies it is this
individual Koreans with the aspirations
that contradict the image of this
goose-stepping brainwash North Koreans
that bring me back to this country every
year
working with these people is not easy
you know it&#39;s more it&#39;s more than being
shadowed in the streets of Pyongyang
kind of more than the numerous armed
checkpoints if the pass through
everywhere you go in the country it is a
simple act of communication that is the
most frustrating experience calls go to
a switchboard and emails are shared by
an entire organization in this context
face-to-face meeting is critical for
getting any work done however one never
knows who is listening in I remember on
one trip I was sitting with my colleague
in the hotel room and I was telling him
about how Co the room was 20 minutes
later the hotel staff burst into the
room and they asked you know we heard
your room is too cold do you need us
adjust the thermostat
I mean seriously talk about customer
service but this society is changing a
lot has been written about grassroots
markets that have sprouted in North
Korea but not a lot has been written
about entrepreneurs who are building
scalable private businesses in the
country the example I&#39;m going to share
with you today is an anonymous composite
of several entrepreneurs who have worked
with it is simply too dangerous to share
a single person&#39;s story and this story
begins with who me a 45 year old lady
living with her two kids and a husband
in Pyongyang who me owns a 2-story
department store on the first floor
you&#39;ll find a supermarket and it&#39;s
topped of goods from all over Asia next
to it it&#39;s a room filled with
electronics if you walk in there you see
flat-screen tvs you&#39;ll see washing
machines and you even find Dyson fans on
a floor above it she carries musical
instruments catering to parents who
believe that musical training would give
the kid and intellectual edge pretty
much like parents from all over the rest
of Asia 11 years ago hung me laughs a
job at a library she saw an opportunity
an opportunity to sell foreign products
to a population staffed of the
opportunities to travel she borrowed
money from a Chinese investor rented a
room in a restaurant and stocked it with
foreign goods
a fears later as some North Koreans
prospered to trade and aspire to own
status symbols who me found a ready
market for flat-screen TVs she expanded
her shop but Hermes entrepreneurship is
hidden it&#39;s hidden from the eyes
observers who study this country and the
reason for this is that when you asked
him me about her business she claims
that it is a state-owned enterprise but
this is nonsense in reality who me
simply pays a portion of a profit to a
government ministry she keeps the
remainder
she makes the manager of decisions and
she&#39;s even able to invest to grow her
business however life is not easy for
whom me in the past when the political
winds have changed entrepreneurs like
her have lost everything entrepreneurs
like whom me a changing North Korean
society in the past people look to the
government as a means to advance their
social status people wanted to climb the
bureaucracy today this same people are
looking to the market they are looking
to set up their own and the price and
this change this change is powerful this
change is not externally imposed on the
country instead it is about individual
Koreans who are creating opportunities
for themselves and their fellow people
North Korean entrepreneurs exists and we
can do more to support these people
thank you
