my journey had embrace started with two
questions the first was a question I had
well as a graduate school student at
Stanford taking a class on public health
I wondered we had a class on infant
mortality and I wondered why infant
mortality was considered a development
indicator when I asked my professor this
question he answered because it&#39;s a
social mirror I was puzzled I wasn&#39;t
sure I knew exactly what he meant by
this the second question someone asked
me as I was moving to India to do this
work she was skeptical and she asked so
many babies in these countries die do
mothers even care or is it an accepted
everyday part of life I came to discover
the answer to both of these questions
soon after i moved to india and after I
began to meet the countless woman who
would lock their babies I&#39;d like to
share one of those stories with you
today how did you know

Lennon&#39;s era para algo algo de nada
unfortunately Chandu is not alone every
year around the world 3 million babies
die within the first twenty eight days
of their life that&#39;s six babies every
minute most of these deaths are
forgotten about for the most part except
for by mothers this is the absolute
worst tragedy a mother could endure
there&#39;s no more helpless of a feeling
than watching your child die and yet in
many of these communities not only do
mothers with their children they are
blamed for these deaths I now know that
a mother no matter how poor no matter
how impoverished no matter how
uneducated will go to any lengths to
save her baby if there are this many
babies still dying there&#39;s something
deeply wrong with the solutions and the
systems that exist today including a
lack of technologies that empower these
mothers to save their children one of
the biggest problems these baby face is
staying warm they&#39;re unable to regulate
their own body temperature that is a
primary function of a baby incubator but
incubators concept to twenty thousand
dollars they require a constant supply
of electricity and they require a
trained doctor or nurse to operate in a
country like India where there&#39;s one
doctor for every 2,000 patients this
poses a huge challenge
my team and I Adam Braves have been
working on a low-cost way to tackle this
problem and what we&#39;ve come up with is
the embrace warmer which looks like a
little sleeping bag for a baby the core
technology as a pouch of a wax-like
substance a phase change material that
when melted maintains a constant
temperature of 37 degrees Celsius for up
to eight hours at a stretch you can heat
this other with a short burst of
electricity or with boiling water and
you can reuse this over and over again
the product is portable it complements
existing practices like skin to skin
care and it&#39;s been designed to be easy
enough for a mother to use look simple
but this has gone through hundreds of
iterations over the years as we&#39;ve
tested and retested to make sure that
it&#39;s locally appropriate what I&#39;ve come
to discover in this process however is
that technology itself is only part of
the solution in order for technology to
be effective there must be intense
technology will only multiply that
intent no one has the intent to shave a
baby more than a mother and yet few if
any solutions in this space are designed
for those with the greatest intense in
fact when embrace first started we
created a version of the product that
could be used by doctors and nurses in a
clinical setting we wanted to introduce
the product into a safer environment
with trained caregivers what we found
out later as we change doctors nurses
and mothers was that it was the mothers
who perform best in our training
assessments it was the mothers were
uneducated and illiterate who paid the
most attention who retained the most
information with the technology designed
with this intent the embrace and warmer
is now saving lives around the world
this is Shiva Malema she comes from a
small village in South India she and her
family are all farmers this is her
mother and her grandmother behind her
she gave birth to a three and a half
pound baby that was kept in the device
and this was a baby a few months later
when we went to visit he was at a
healthy weight and
mood in the house was festive as the
family was deciding what to name the
baby in the nine-month naming ceremony
and although it was a joyous occasion it
was also a stark reminder to us that in
India many babies aren&#39;t named until
they hit nine months because it&#39;s so
common they&#39;ll die before then this is
Kathy Keerthi lost her first baby and
gave birth to a second child at a little
over three pounds that was kept in and
warmer and this is the baby three months
later you can tell she&#39;s grown into a
nice little butterball and she just
celebrated her first birthday and this
is sara sara is from Uganda she has a
fourth-grade education she&#39;s also a
farmer she gave birth to her baby one
month prematurely those cats in the
warmer and this is a baby at seven
months she&#39;s happy and healthy this
picture was taken a week ago embrace has
now helped over 5,000 babies mostly in
India with pilots happening in nine
countries around the world and we hope
to help many more not only with this
technology but with a line of innovative
affordable technologies designed for the
users with the greatest intent it&#39;s only
now that I fully understand what my
professor meant when he said infant
mortality is a social mirror it&#39;s
because I&#39;ve seen firsthand over and
over again how selfless and how
courageous these mothers are they will
do anything to save their babies and yet
these babies are still dying in such
vast numbers today&#39;s mirror reflects a
profoundly sad picture I believe we can
solve this problem and other major
social problems by designing solutions
that enable the most beautiful part of
the human spirit to be actualized our
intent to protect and to care for those
whom we love and that is the picture I
hope to see when we look into that
mirror thank you
