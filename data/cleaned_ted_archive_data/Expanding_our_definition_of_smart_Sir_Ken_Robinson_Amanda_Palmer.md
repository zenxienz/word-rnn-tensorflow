there&#39;s my other confession is I&#39;m going
to blame pregnancy for the father he
makes me laugh without really having to
say anything so this could be super
awkward if I just turn into some
giggling simpering school child who
proposed just please forgive me hi Hey
how are you Oh God it started okay so
I&#39;m going to start off we canvassed our
TEDx amazing TEDx community around the
world and I have picked two questions
that were submitted from those questions
for you so I&#39;m going to just kick right
off with the question from Lisa chin
from TEDx Zuzu in China who asks I
watched your house schools kill
creativity talk in 2006 have you seen
any changes in education since then yes
what are they that&#39;s my all right okay I
didn&#39;t know there be supplementals um
I&#39;m screwed actually you know I didn&#39;t
want to say this I mean Ted has been a
fantastic thing for me the talks been
seen we think about 25 million times
being viewed online but I think it&#39;s you
could probably multiply that by 10
because it gets shown at events like
this or large events so I don&#39;t know
maybe it&#39;s been seen by 2 300 million
people I mean I know that&#39;s not Gangnam
style you know
or Miley Cyrus but I don&#39;t twerk yeah
and are you sure
well now rule about how to rule I don&#39;t
twerk I mean I I might today I don&#39;t
know it depends of the mood takes me I
think in fact I just did it was a small
small private twerk so how happy
actually quite a lot you know that I was
as fast as he listened to Susan about
all that she&#39;s had I get lots and lots
of emails from kids from parents from
teachers about how that particular talk
had a huge impact on them I know schools
that have reorganized their Thai way of
doing things because of that I know hold
school districts who&#39;ve reordered
themselves around the issues that I was
raising what I&#39;m keen to say is that I
wasn&#39;t making this stuff up I gave a
talk a while ago at a university in the
Midwest somewhere and over lunch with
the faculty beforehand some guys said to
me you&#39;ve been at this a long time now
haven&#39;t you I said what&#39;s that he said
you know trying to reform education I
said yes that&#39;s right he said what is it
seven years now I said how do you mean
he said you know since that TED talk and
I said yes but I was alive before that
you know this was so that was
that was like a moment ready I just
showed up and and at a time there&#39;s a
private thing but but the reason I say
it is that it it also resonated that
with all kinds of people and it
resonated because it&#39;s true that our
education systems squander huge amounts
of children&#39;s talent and the consequence
is that very many people don&#39;t discover
their talents and it&#39;s not an accident
it&#39;s systemic you know years ago you&#39;re
from Liverpool on you Sheffield I&#39;m very
so to hear that sorry I was misinformed
is there anybody else I could be
speaking to instead anything anybody
closer to Liverpool perhaps I don&#39;t know
no I&#39;m your best bet
all right well in my twenties I went
round the abattoir
in Liverpool no the slaughterhouse you
know which is a factory for killing
animals I don&#39;t know why I went now to
be honest and I think I was taking a
girl out you know I mean I fun I know
how to treat a woman
you know cometh before we have dinner
let&#39;s see where it came from and
and I went we went around this thing and
you know it&#39;s designed to kill animals
and it does I mean very few escaped you
know they&#39;re on chest width there aren&#39;t
survivors clubs you know that get
together and think about the old days at
the abattoir
and at the far end of it there was a
door that said veterinarian and I
thought well he must be depressed you
know at the end of the average day you
know so I said after what&#39;s the
veterinarian for is it a bit late you
know for that and and he said well he
comes in this guy show me around he said
the veterinarian comes in every couple
of weeks to conduct random autopsies so
I thought well he must have seen the
pattern by now surely in I mean another
another 2,000 dead cows with bolts in
their head there&#39;s there&#39;s something
happening in there I&#39;m going to get to
the back of it I refuse to be deterred
are you gonna bring this back there yeah
yeah any time any minute now yeah any
minute
hey but my my point is and there is one
that if you design a system with certain
features to do certain things don&#39;t be
surprised if it does it and if you
design a school system based on the
principles of industrialism and
conformity and you strangle it with a
culture of standardized testing which
bleeds the life out of teachers and
students alike don&#39;t be surprised if
this is not a cordon of creativity and
vitality and don&#39;t be surprised if in
America 30% of kids leave before the
12th grade don&#39;t be surprised if
depression is one of the biggest
problems now affecting schools around
the world and don&#39;t be surprised if the
whole thing in the end is a source of
more frustration than it is success for
a lot of people and my answer for a lot
of education systems is that you know
often policymakers scratch their head
and think how can we solve all these
problems and the simple way to solve
them is to stop causing them don&#39;t do
that do something else
I don&#39;t know and if you just be quiet
for a minute they I I don&#39;t know what I
was it&#39;s not due till April you know the
thing is nothing the thing is that so
what I&#39;m saying is the reason I think I
get such a response from students and
from teachers and not just them brought
from policy makers and often governments
I&#39;m pleased to say it&#39;s because they
recognize that I don&#39;t think people are
acting out to the wrong intention you
know they&#39;re doing the wrong thing for
the right reasons and and what I&#39;m
trying to show and I said I didn&#39;t make
this up I stand in a very long tradition
people have been arguing for holism
who&#39;ve been arguing for human systems of
Education not automatons based systems
education and which ones ones which are
generally responsive for the talents
that people have and I&#39;m delighted to
say there are lots of countries in the
world which are moving in that direction
some like Finland have been doing it for
a very long time so I think we have time
for one question from the audience which
is absurd but thankfully second is not
leaving tonight right
not much you&#39;ve heard something I don&#39;t
I mean he might be if it doesn&#39;t behave
but um can we have I can&#39;t see where
microphones are does someone have a very
quick question that won&#39;t prompt a very
long answer no pressure
well if there are no yes there&#39;s some
doing that yes if you can wait yeah
microphone yeah sir can I guess my
question you know throwing his voice up
here we see when&#39;s the tipping point
right at one point I&#39;m back here it&#39;s
it&#39;s some laps not helping is it I&#39;m
back here
the multi-directional microphone in the
dark I&#39;m back here not that big of a
really go yeah yeah hi
when&#39;s the tipping point at what point
do you see something changing that will
will really start to make significant
shifts shifts in outcome I think several
things are happening already you know we
were hearing earlier from Susan about
Gandhi and Gandhi&#39;s other great dictum
was be the change you want to see in the
world and my case for all of this is
that we need a theory of change and what
policy makers often seem to believe is
that they can only affect change in
schools by grabbing the reins and taking
command of everything and controlling it
and that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing around the
world command and control mentalities
and education is not an industrial
system it&#39;s an organic system it&#39;s a
human system and we make much more
progress if we apply principles of
Agriculture an actually of organic
farming you might compare organic
farming with industrial farming and say
it&#39;s based on completely different
principles so the change is already
happening it&#39;s happening everywhere
there are brilliant schools all over the
place there are great teachers running
great classrooms there are great home
schoolers there are wonderful initial
school districts are trying to do the
things that we&#39;ve been talking about it
isn&#39;t we have to wait and then see if it
if it reaches a final conclusion organic
life isn&#39;t like that it&#39;s a constant
process of change and it won&#39;t be
finished either so I always say to
people change what you&#39;re doing change
where you are if you&#39;re a teacher if
you&#39;re a school superintendent if you&#39;re
a student it change what you do change
your world and if enough people change
their worlds we changed the world
whether it happens quickly or slowly we
don&#39;t know but at least we can set off
on the journey and many people are well
II I think very well advanced along it
already
[Applause]
here is the reason that we do not have
time for more questions is that I am
about to spring a surprise on second
which makes me deeply happy we thought
that we should pay tribute to the man
with twenty five million views are all
star of all stars if you will and so to
do that we roped in someone who knows a
thing or two about virality it&#39;s just
like a monetary thing you just yes yes
I&#39;m afraid you owe me no I am actually
going to buzz off stage and leave you
sitting here not feeling awkward because
I would like to welcome to the stage
miss Amanda Palmer with a song she has
written especially when I can stay right
there
[Applause]
hi hi oh wait
Oh can you hear me I&#39;m really nervous I
was up here yesterday and I wasn&#39;t
nervous and now you&#39;re here hello
imagine how I feel all right um so oh
god yeah I live with this all the time
you know minute so uh okay
hi sir Ken um uh it&#39;s just a song I&#39;m
just oh okay I I wrote this yesterday
basically um just a short introduction
because you need to know the background
for it to make any sense at all
um a good TED talk
this has been an amazing conference so
far by the way and my mind is blown
again it was last year - and a good TED
talk really changes you and a really
really good TED talk not only changes
you it the way it changes you can change
which is to say you know I you watched
does anyone watch them repeatedly
because I sometimes - and if the work
hang on you can change and I first saw
your talk back at the beginning when I
was you know a few years ago when I was
first discovering Ted and it really
moved me a lot especially the part about
the choreographer um and I don&#39;t need to
go into it you guys have all seen it and
soon um I was that kid I was this like
flighty weird chaotic couldn&#39;t focus
didn&#39;t want to read weird already girl
and I have also spent my life really
believing there is a misdiagnosis and a
lot of kids instead of a celebration
that part of the talk meant a lot to me
and then Ted write me about two months
ago and said will you write this song
for sir Ken and I was in Australia
writing a book ironically based on my
own TED talk on a sick deadline and was
like sure maybe I&#39;ll just write it when
I get to Ted with my husband who&#39;s a
writer who will maybe do all the work
I brought Neil Gaiman with me he&#39;s
sitting right there and so we thought
that we would you know write the song on
Saturday or Sunday and I would rope it
Jason Webley my friend who also came and
played who was awesome and we we decided
to prime ourselves on Saturday night so
we took Sir Ken on the laptop into bed
and we watched and I didn&#39;t mean uh uh
I&#39;m getting a bit edgy now you know
and the class struck me and it totally
different way than I imagined it dead
yes I&#39;m sure yeah it&#39;s actually striking
me in a completely different way no I
was just coming up on this very stick to
it it struck me in a new way because I
all of a sudden was sort of seeing it
for Neal&#39;s perspective too and um where
was the laptop connected that&#39;s really
blighted uh Neal um I don&#39;t know if you
guys know Neil Gaiman he&#39;s my husband
he&#39;s you should go him or me he&#39;s a
really accomplished writer who didn&#39;t go
to college and uh I found out a story he
told me when we were first going out he
when he was 17 he&#39;s also he&#39;s British
he&#39;s one of you and you guys are
somewhat the same generation and sort of
reminded each other they&#39;re both very
handsome he it&#39;s not getting any better
by the way I&#39;m just saying when when you
when you was 17 it was going through the
the the crushing ness of the British
public school system and which I&#39;m sure
you know a lot about and his parents got
a letter from the administration of the
school saying we would like you to come
in because we believe that Neil&#39;s
not inconsiderable talents would be
better educated elsewhere and here&#39;s the
thing his parents got the letter and
because they were British and super
embarrassed didn&#39;t even go into the
office they just pulled him out of
school because they assumed he would be
expelled and then you know maybe were
all the luckier for it because he would
often became he&#39;ll Gaiman but it wasn&#39;t
until 30 years later just recently when
he ran into one of the administrators of
the school who told him oh that&#39;s not
what that little
all we thought you were so talented you
should probably go to art school
and we wanted to just tell your parents
so I saw you know whatever that&#39;s the
story and the story of the writing of
this song is a 12-minute TED talk it was
mostly written in bathrooms and
conference faces of Ted I tried to rope
Neil or Jason and Saturday night we went
out to dinner instead Sunday we were
really going to muscle them and do it we
were like oh my god we don&#39;t have a song
let&#39;s just do a Beatles cover and write
some words about education we were
really screwed
I wrote this yesterday and um I hope
it&#39;s good I&#39;d really nervous I&#39;m sorry
that if I fuck up are you trying to
lower our expectations here is I would I
don&#39;t know uh so here I have to read it
because I just touched it an hour ago
all right
[Music]
it isn&#39;t easy to be human not that with
any other choice when she was young they
gave her heavy books to read the chief
pigeon struggled all words just look
like toys and they punished her
unmanageable fee we cannot measure
what&#39;s important
just what&#39;s easiest to find and what
they found is that sheet with her life a
weed without a ground that she could
grow or a son to give her light this is
most certainly alarming what she needs
Oh can&#39;t these little brats learn
anything little a proper education a
dancer in a prison little bricks and I&#39;m
tear down a boom when we were small the
teachers told us that we needed to be
brain which one to swallow a compendium
of rules and to be quiet like the others
to apply ourselves and save the things
we care about for later after school
as his imagination fled in his
unmanageable mind
they made him run around a track and
fucked his speed but he just wanted to
write stories in the safe fields of his
mind this is most certainly alarming
what he needs
it&#39;s look at these little breaths learn
anything at all a proper education a
writer in a prison little pricks a nun
tear down all covering this world and
it&#39;s unmanageable children all curled up
stared inside could be so strong they
are so willing to be wrong not like
these teachers who are so afraid to die
don&#39;t they know that that just means
that you&#39;re alive and by the by you can
do anything at all
without a proper education the whole
earth and a prison little breaks a nun
tear down a ball
so here&#39;s to you Sir Ken Robinson heaven
is a place where people play spray the
walls outside because when the world is
in the balance
Oliver lot what was it again what did
they say in the letter and the world is
in the balance all of uh
not inconsiderable talents will be
needed for the challenge as we rise
are we most certainly will fall
[Music]
Oh haven&#39;t we learned anything at all
[Music]
it&#39;s fantastically thank you
ladies and gentlemen Amanda Palmer
answer Ken Robinson
can I do this
yeah okay
oh thanks time thank you very much
