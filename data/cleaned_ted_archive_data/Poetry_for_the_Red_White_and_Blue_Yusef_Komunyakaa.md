it&#39;s an honor this honor to be here to
share with you two poems the first one
is titled grenade
there&#39;s no rehearsal to turn flesh into
dust so quickly a hair-trigger
a cup hammer into brain a split second
between band and infamy it lands on the
ground a few soldiers ducked in the
others are caught and a half run and one
throws himself down on the grenade all
the Watchers stopped a flash smoke
silence the sound fills the whole day
flesh and earth fall into the eyes and
mouths of the men a dream trapped amid
air they touch their legs and arms the
groins years and knows the sand what
happened some are crying others
or laughing some are almost dancing
someone tries to put the dead man back
together he just drove on the damn thing
sir
a flash smoke silence the day blown
apart for those who can walk away widows
ever shreds of flesh and bloody rags
gathered up and stuff into a bag each
breath belongs to him it&#39;s song it&#39;s
curse every prayer is his your body
doesn&#39;t belong to your mind and soul who
are you do you remember the man left in
the jungle the others told their lives
to this phantom do they feel like you
would his loved ones remember him that
little part of stature erected in his
name didn&#39;t exist and does it enlarge
their lives
you wish he had lied down in that closed
coffin not wonder the streets I enter
your bedroom at midnight the woman you
love should never understand who what
you remember what he used to say if you
give a kite too much strain that&#39;ll
break free
that unselfish certainty but you can&#39;t
remember when you began to live his
unspoken dreams the second poem is
entitled
soliloquy heavy metal soliloquy
after night long
white-hot helva of blue steel we rolled
into Baghdad plugged into
government-issued earphones here in hard
rock the drum machines wrapped up
guitars roared in our heads
all their gods were crawling on all
fours
these bloated replicas of Han beetles
drew us to targets as if they could
breathe and think the turrets rotated
360 degrees
the infrared scopes could see through
stone there were mounds of silver in the
or lead or our helmets were the only
shape of the world lightning was inside
of a titanium chinks and the music was
almost wholly even if blood was now
leaking from our eardrums
we were moving to a predestined score as
bodies slumped under the bright have in
wait a thunderous fall in sky locked in
shield off from desert sand and
equatorial eyes I was inside a will a
carmine world caught and a limbo a
finger on the trigger getting ready to
die getting ready to be born
thank you
