I want to talk today about technology
wealth and culture and their
relationship to Africa as a continent
when I started doing what I&#39;m doing now
I was propelled along that road by two
things that happened to me the first of
which was I read an article by John
Perry Barlow in Wired magazine called
the Internet in Africa I thought about
half of this was completely crazy the
other half was really very very
interesting
the basic assumption of this article was
that Africa could move from being
essentially agricultural and peasant
societies skipping this bit the
smokestack culture of in the Industrial
Revolution to getting to post-industrial
postmodern society going from producer
to service economy and finding through
technology something that could be done
to create wealth within the continent
the second thing that happened to me was
that I went to a supper party and a
quite senior person in an NGO said why
does bikini Faso have to sell its crops
why can&#39;t it feed its people and there
happened to be around that table a
development economist and if you know
economists they go on at great length
and he explained the world trade system
and at the end of this rather lengthy
diatribe we then got to talking about
what was it that perhaps technology
might do that would help contribute to a
country like Burkina Faso making its way
in the world in some economic sense so
that&#39;s what I want to talk about today I
want to talk about technology not in the
sense of the kinds of things that people
in the development sector often talk
about I don&#39;t want to talk about One
Laptop Per child I don&#39;t want to talk
about agricultural pricing systems these
are all wonderful good things but these
are window openers they give you some
idea of the potential of Technology what
I want to talk about today are door
openers of fundamental change things
that will make things very very
different
the first of these door openers is to
talk about selling shortage and
corruption when I first started doing
what I was doing what I&#39;m doing in
Africa people were buying fixed phones
and in order to buy the fixed phones
they had to fill in usually forms in
triplicate attach a photograph find a
district official to sign the form put
the form into the phone company which
was a monopoly run by the government and
maybe two three years later they would
get their phone now
if you paid a bribe you could get ahead
in the queue so you could actually get
your phone immediately and I became
fascinated by how much people were
paying so you would pay 10 20 30 dollars
to to get your phone installed now
scroll forward six years and actually
what has happened is that an African in
any country in Africa can walk into a
mobile phone outlet and for the down lay
of perhaps three dollars can walk out
have a phone and be immediately talking
to their mother their father the pet are
their relatives their children their
work colleagues just like that no bribe
needs to be paid now we were all
agonizing about how do you get rid of
corruption this got rid of corruption
nobody bribes to buy a mobile phone you
simply walk into a shop so you go from
selling shortage to having plenty now I
ask you also think are there other areas
of African life where this same
principle can be applied because it
seems to me that in that way you suck
corruption out of parts of the system
the second part is selling shortage is
to do with price elasticity
that&#39;s another economists fancy term
what does this mean well it means that
when mobiles were first available on the
continent
you would pay say $1,300 to get one now
as I said before you pay $3 the
difference is thousands we&#39;re able to
use them and now millions and hundreds
of millions are able to use them but
we&#39;re not at the end of that price curve
as you bring the price down more people
are able to afford it
and if we keep doing that we&#39;re probably
about two-thirds of the way through the
process then more and more people will
be able to use those phones there was a
survey conducted in a suburb of Nairobi
which has already been mentioned Kabara
and I say a suburb this is what is
laughingly described as an informal
settlement a slum people live in tin
shacks and the three quarters are
william live there this is like a
victorian print in the victorian
industrial city and out of these places
will become the future of the city and
it does this survey discover that four
people share a mobile phone so I talked
to my development friends and they will
say on Africans ingenious and sharing in
the face of adversity nonsense this is
actually a market doing begging this is
people who are not being served at the
price they can afford
and I would contend that two out of
those four can be enfranchised by the
market at the moment the average revenue
per user which is the industry&#39;s
technical term for actually describing
this revenue are Fu&#39;s is actually
between ten to fifteen dollars in India
those are pros are down to four to seven
dollars so we&#39;ve still got a ways to
come down in terms of price and that
means that the number of people using
phones will continue to go up now if you
look at the new technologies that are
becoming available wireless and mobile
voice over IP then I believe that you
will see low-cost niche voice operators
because it is extremely difficult for
the mobile operators to cannibalize
their own existing high revenues some
may be able to do it but not all of them
and if you look at companies like locale
in Brazil you see in a sense the
prefiguration of this trend so that&#39;s
selling shortage in corruption now
second door-opener bandwidth is the fuel
of the new economy it&#39;s like a petrol
and if you look at Africa in this map of
Africa you will see that there is a
single cable connecting Africa
internationally to the rest of the world
this is fat-free it is the only cable
worth talking about on the continent it
only goes down
the west coast of the continent it was
built by a shareholder consortium and
its African members were all incumbent
telcos and they all have monopolies in
their own country as a result when they
first started selling this bandwidth
they sold it at $25,000 per megabit per
second per month and I&#39;m not going to
keep repeating that so when I say a
number that&#39;s what I mean this price has
now come down to ten to fifteen thousand
dollars at the expensive end and sixteen
hundred at the lower end now there was a
price investigation in Mauritius which
is an Indian Ocean island right out on
the far end of the cable and as a result
of the price investigation by the
regulator the price was brought down to
three thousand dollars now why does any
of this matter well I was sitting at
supper last night with the owner of an
angle and IFP who was saying he wished
he could lower the prices that he was
offering to his customers because see
they would then be able to sell to more
customers and we were joined by a young
guy running an American software company
he explained what he did and he said
well completely unprompted I wish I
could bring some of my software
programming to Kenya but the bandwidth
price man is so expensive we just can&#39;t
do it
so actually high priced bandwidth keeps
business out of the continent now we
have been campaigning for open and fair
access to international bandwidth of
this kind when I say we I should mention
two individuals who are in the room
Joseph Fisher oh and Eric Aussie Ocwen
both of whom have formed part of a
network of Africans who have been
bringing this change about so we have a
situation on the east coast of Africa
where four cables are going to arrive
all of them working under some version
of open access principles and all
offering a starting price of between 500
to a thousand dollars so you can begin
to see that the content is now ready to
take part in the global conversation
because it has that bandwidth fuel okay
the next door opener I want to I want to
ask the audience how many of you own can
I have them lights up slightly so I can
see people&#39;s hands how many of you own a
Rolls Royce I saw a guy with a t-shirt
so I thought maybe he owned one no he
has only got the t-shirt he hasn&#39;t got
the car fine
okay that&#39;s high cost low volume that&#39;s
the mentality of selling shortage low
cost high volume how many of you of auto
budget airline ticket show of hands
okay very simply that&#39;s low cost high
volume so that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at
this is the transition I&#39;ve already
described that took place with mobile
now if you&#39;re African you&#39;re going to be
sitting here looking at me and saying
well it&#39;s all very well saying that you
know broadband is going to come and
androids over IP and all of these kinds
of things who on earth is going to buy
it man so let me give you the example of
Kenya Kenya has 32 million people of
those 32 million people two million have
bank accounts and half a million have
property of a sufficient value that
would suggest that they should be right
candidates to buy broadband so the
people are out there there&#39;s an emergent
middle class this is the beginning this
is the start and you will see this
emergent little class in Kenya Senegal
Nigeria places like that it&#39;s already
happening I want to give you a tour to
the future when Kenya put its exam
results online for secondary students
there were six hundred and fifty five
thousand exam results two hundred and
fifty thousand students went online to
look at those exam results so that is
the what one of the earlier speakers was
talking about as the cheetah generation
I have no idea what animal that
generation is going to be but they are
going to be very different to the
current generation so we go on to the
next of the door openers this is the
Hall of Fame
Sani Abacha Emperor Bokassa Mobutu Sese
Seko all the great guys the big vend why
benzy now
I observed when I looked at the telecom
sector in Africa as I traveled around
you would find a circumstance in which
the president of a particular country it
will remain nameless his wife was the
shareholder in the leading satellite
reseller in another country the daughter
of the president was the owner of the
leading GSM operator I could give you
several examples sometimes cut out to
use so you can&#39;t actually see it but
actually it occurs the government is
deeply involved in a particular set of
decisions in terms of business it has
its fingers in the pot now what you have
in Africa is a kind of monopoly
franchise capitalism so I get given the
franchise for BMW cars I&#39;m the only guy
who sells them therefore I could sell
them pretty much as expensively as I
like and of course there are ways around
this but that&#39;s that&#39;s the general
principle now what happened about five
years ago was something called the
African ISP Association was set up and
began to campaign for people getting
licenses and competition in the market
who weren&#39;t the usual suspects who
weren&#39;t the friends and relatives of the
men in power and this is caused a a
broadening of the business
ecology within a lot of countries so for
instance in South Africa due to a lot of
other forces as well there are 366
companies that are known as value-added
network providers in Kenya there are
probably somewhere between 30 and 50
companies now this is not true of all
countries but if you have this diverse
business ecology and you have an
independent regulator decisions which
you would call in in where I come from
stitched-up decisions are open to
discussion there challengeable people
debate how a decision is made and who
gets the prize at the end of the process
and this same liberalisation and
deepening of and making more complex in
the sense of the business sector is
happening within media so if you looked
at Uganda 15 years ago it had a handful
of radio stations and now it has 1500
plus radio stations so you can see
something is happening
now this technological revolution like
the Industrial Revolution is not really
just about technology it&#39;s about social
and cultural relations if we go back to
that Stone Age tribe that we were
hearing about yesterday
particular Stone Age tribe and one of
the guys goes off traveling and in those
days there were no mobile phones so he
comes back and he has to walk all the
way back and tell them the message he
says guys the tribe up the road
they&#39;ve got bronze axes we&#39;ve only got
someone&#39;s butt with these guys who got
bronze axes they&#39;re really good at
killing people and the defenders and
they good at killing animals so we
should be making bronze axes and he&#39;s
pitching away to the tribe and spell it
you know giving all the advantages of
having bronze axes and how good they are
and a guy puts his hand up at the back
and says excuse me what are the stone
chip is going to do I don&#39;t want to be a
bronze smelter that&#39;s dangerous work
what are we going to do a stone
Schippers so technological revolutions
have winners and losers and the stone
chippers in the telecom sector of the
several thousand kenya telecom
messengers who have be recently been
made redundant so if you have winners
and losers how do you persuade people
that there is a better life how in a
sense do you say to them there is a
prize at the end of this there is paying
but there is prize a prize at the end of
this and this is a discussion about
traditional versus modern this is Abuja
which is the capital of Nigeria and
Nigerians if you talk to them about
Abuja they will say ah
Buju this is not Nigeria this is America
if you drive the road from Johannesburg
to Pretoria big freeway come going home
time traffic jams just like Los Angeles
smart car dealerships big high-tech
buildings I&#39;m not in Africa really
something&#39;s happening but I&#39;m not in
Africa so what is it
that modern Africa will look like what
will the look and feel of modern Africa
be like I don&#39;t know the answers that
question but I think that&#39;s quite
important because if you&#39;re going to
persuade people that the better life is
worth having what are you telling them
that it is this is Nelson Mandela in the
phantom mall and people go and have
their photograph taken underneath it and
this is sort of a blending of the
traditional and the modern and one day
African tourists in great numbers will
go and have their picture taken in the
San Tan mall because they will have
enough money to travel within the
continent more wisely now this is a very
badly executed design idea but wait but
wait with me here or kina Faso academic
silvestra where Drago did this with his
kids in the project he runs the point
about this is it&#39;s not just about owning
a computer it&#39;s about possessing the
idea so if somebody like OMA tech can
actually make an African designed
computer that people can identify with
it is theirs and maybe people all around
the world will say I want an African
computer what is an Apple computer what
is an iPod an iPod is a hard disk in hot
pants this is where we go here now I&#39;ve
talked to people all talk about facts
we&#39;ve seen lots of charts and so on and
so forth what I want to say is that what
will mobilize change in many ways is
actually dreams longings desires
fantasies this is all the subconscious
to that produces fiction so how I
understand foreign cultures is often
through film when people are making love
or making war you can tell something
about them this film Hong Kong made film
so trilogy fantastically enormous Lee
well made and was reversions of scores
AZ&#39;s last movie The Departed now the
African equivalent is Nollywood and you
will hear later about Nollywood this is
sold on DVDs all across West Africa
this is the b-movie of Africa how did
this happen because actually with
digital technology you can make low
entry into the market and the same
digital technology is capable of
creating digital cinemas because digital
projectors are very cheap now so all of
this product that we&#39;ve been seeing up
on the screen which unless it&#39;s been on
television in Africa almost nobody will
have seen is capable of being shown in
digital cinemas that will make money in
the future
final thing pay TV pay TV was until very
recently a monopoly run by South African
company called STV another company has
entered the market that company is
interested in doing local content so
media markets will begin to emerge so
that there will be ways of imagining and
talking about the new Africa as it puts
itself into place I think one of the
strange things about working in Africa
is time and time again people have that
little shrugging motion and they look at
their feet in they go well this is
Africa when the water is not working the
electricity is not working Internet&#39;s
not working I think that there are
people in this room who have the ideas
the energy and the imagination to be
able to reach a situation where we can
say this is Africa and be proud
thank you
[Applause]
