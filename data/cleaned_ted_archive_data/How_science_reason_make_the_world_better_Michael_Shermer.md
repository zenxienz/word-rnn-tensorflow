most conservatives today are more
liberal than most liberals were in the
1950s how that happened is the subject
of my talk which I&#39;ve titled the moral
arc how science and reason have bent the
moral universe toward truth justice and
freedom by morality I mean the survival
and flourishing of sentient beings
survival and flourishing this is what
evolution is vouchsafed us in our nature
to strive for and by sentient beings I
mean not just us any creatures with
brains that are capable of sensing
perceiving feeling and especially
suffering important question about
morality is not can they think but can
they feel can they suffer the art part
things are getting better I claim we are
living in the most moral time in our
species epoch slavery has been outlawed
in every country in the world where it&#39;s
still practiced in the form of slave
labor and sex trafficking this is being
combated with vigorously probably will
be ended by 2020 to 2030 the death
penalty has been outlawed in almost
every country in the world there&#39;s one
south of us that still holds a bet most
states that have it on the books almost
never practice it my own state of
California for example most inmates on
death row die of old age before they&#39;re
executed and most states never employ
except for Texas anyway so democracy has
been spreading electoral democracies
there were only 15 and 1,900 by 2000
there were 91 of the hundred 83
countries almost half January of this
year there were 60% there were 118
electoral democracies a Monday there
were 119 but it&#39;s back down to 118 now
so moral progress is you know three
steps forward to back and so forth but
we&#39;re or making it there the expansion
of the moral sphere to include more
people more sentient beings
rights for women rights for minorities
and so forth we&#39;re in the middle of a
rights revolution right now that we can
all participate in and watch unfold and
see exactly how it happens
gay rights in same-sex marriage you can
see who supports it secular forces of
enlightenment humanism and you can see
who opposes it dogmatic fundamentalist
religion now we&#39;re making progress in
that area as well if you&#39;re like me and
you think by the way I have some good
news on this if you&#39;re like me and you
think that the legalization of marijuana
is also another step of moral progress
I found biblical support for both gay
marriage and pot legalization in
Leviticus chapter 13 chapter 20 verse 13
where it says if a man lies with another
man he must be stoned
[Applause]
try that on your conservative friends oh
man by science and reason I mean since
the Scientific Revolution in the
Enlightenment it&#39;s no longer acceptable
to just say my beliefs my morals are
better than yours because they&#39;re mine
or because my God is better than your
God or because my country can pound the
crap out of your country those are no
longer acceptable arguments to make
people can make that make them but we
can reject them based on what I call
Hitchens dictum after my friend
Christopher Hitchens who said that which
can be asserted without evidence can be
dismissed without evidence you have to
have reasons for your moral beliefs
arguments rationality empirical evidence
you can&#39;t just assert it any more also a
lot of our moral improvement has come
about from what I call the which theory
of causality if you think that women
cavorting with demons causes crop
failures disease and disasters you&#39;re
either insane or you live 500 years ago
nobody believes this anymore science has
debunked that theory of causality so
much of what we used to do to people was
based on bad ideas that have been
improved with science and reason so what
can we do well not all of us can invent
the Internet and end disease or whatever
we can all just take small little
incremental steps we&#39;re not trying to
get to utopia we&#39;re just trying to make
the world a little bit better tomorrow
if than it was today and to that extent
by the courage of our convictions and
the boldness of our actions just try to
make the world just slightly better
today than it was yesterday and so forth
and so on and that&#39;s how the moral arc
has bent toward justice truth and
freedom thank you
[Applause]
