there are three periods in history
during which the world has made
remarkable progress and each and every
time Africa as we left behind the first
of these periods was the Renaissance
when people like Isaac Newton Leonardo
da Vinci accepting up with ideas that
will transform the world the second was
the Industrial Revolution when the steam
engine electricity etc we were invented
and now in the Third Age the Information
Age where the PC the internet and mobile
telephony have transformed our world and
each time Africa&#39;s we left behind a few
years ago president invective South
Africa proclaimed the period of the
African Renaissance and so I wondered
what could we do this time to ensure
that we will not left behind that this
time we took up could actually achieve
the promise of creating precent
prosperity in our continent and so was
born the idea for the African Leadership
Academy the Academy aspires to serve an
engine that can help to bring about this
Renaissance for Africa so one thing I
realized is that each and every time
that these tremendous change changes
occurred in the world there was an
explosion of individuals who had ideas
who came up with ideas and implemented
these ideas that led about that led to
tremendous change in the world let&#39;s
call the individuals change agents now
Africa has a lot of these change agents
already we&#39;ve seen and met several of
them at Ted over the last few days and
heard about the idea and what they&#39;re
doing to implement them so our goal and
the Academy is to become more systematic
and proactive about developing these
change agents for Africa so that we
don&#39;t just leave it to chance but really
harness a group of people who are united
by one common purpose to bring about
peace and prosperity in Africa
so practically speaking how does the
Academy work we&#39;ll identify young people
from all three to four countries in
Africa 125 each and every year that we
believe have the potential to change
Africa will bring these young people to
the Academy for two years which will
form the beginning of a lifelong process
of nurturing these amazing young people
to become the change agents that Africa
so badly needs think of like a sort of a
road scholarship for young leaders in
Africa so 50 years from now what we
ought to see by then we were to develop
6,000 change agents for Africa let&#39;s say
a hundred of these have become effective
and ethical political leaders who are
contributing to peace and stability on
the continent another hundred have
contributed to finally in cures to some
of Africa&#39;s most ailing health problems
a thousand have become entrepreneurs and
created millions of jobs others have
become central bank governors university
presidents teachers doctors etc and
maybe just a few have launched the
Microsoft in the googles of Africa or
have become the Thomas Edison&#39;s and it&#39;s
almost Jefferson South Africa and
together this group can work together to
bring about this elusive African
Renaissance so just quickly want to show
you a couple of slides of the campus
which is opening next out of Europe yeah
thank you
thank you Thank You Fred
