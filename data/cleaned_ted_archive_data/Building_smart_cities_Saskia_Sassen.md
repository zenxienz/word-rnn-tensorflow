dozens and dozens of cities are being
built around the world hundreds are on
the drawing board hundreds and hundreds
as it happens in our world all kinds of
firms are emerging and not so many but a
few that are ready to build the city for
you a high-tech the most famous one
probably is Songdo in South Korea there
are also firms that will leave you a
city they want to keep ownership now
these cities are all marked by extremely
high-tech systems cities have long been
places for technological innovation
think about the Roman aqueduct but this
is different this is ah this is really
the whole city as a tech space like this
here is the issue the technology is the
inert of this city the rate of
obsolescence of technology today is very
high what happens when the technology
which is the inside the whole city is
kind of a tech space becomes obsolete to
the cities come crashing down cities
actually when you think the good old
cities they have outlasted kingdoms
republics multinationals financial firms
why how do they do that and one way of
thinking about it is that the city is a
complex but incomplete system and in
that complexity lies its possibility for
reinventing itself think of cities like
London Istanbul
maybe not Long Beach but even Long Beach
has reinvented itself if I got it right
but I expected the port and I got like a
resort
wonderful having a great time
this is a very distinguished old
building distinguished for its very
sinister history today with the addition
of a very innovative environmentally
socially etc edition by Norman Foster is
considered the most democratic political
building that we have in the world that
is the city as a living system I love
this image which I saw in the in the
Venice architecture Biennale this past
summer and it so shows this city you
know the animal in this is the arc
finale
through the darkness of an earlier
historic period the video that comes
with it which I want to show sort of
suggests to me these dark forces of
history cities that have died and then
they outlived Istanbul 3,000 years Rome
and they all come through so here comes
the video that lasts for about 50
seconds these are the dark forces of
history in my imagination

cities are living systems their systems
were technology buildings and people
interact technology I repeat has always
been part of the city the question
really is high tech and rates of
obsolescence so you have a city this is
Rotterdam a heavy port part port city
and one part that is not no longer
necessary for the port and it becomes a
very domesticated lovely almost suburban
place there all for living systems that
interact with a biosphere this is one of
my favorites I wouldn&#39;t want to live
there and I bet you it&#39;s a high luxury
apartment building but it gives the idea
I have been doing some research on how
we can use biosphere capabilities to to
sort of address some of the issues that
cities confront and one that is great
that that just that was just discovered
is a bacterium that likes to live in
brown waters in other words what we
produce in vast quantities in bathrooms
and kitchens and as it lives its little
lives in these brown waters it produces
a molecule of a kind of plastic which is
resistant durable but biodegradable it
recalls what is now a negative force it
is a burden they don&#39;t know how to
dispose it into actually a basic input
for all kinds of industries that&#39;s just
an example now two questions on
technology one is can technology hack
the city and can the city hack
technology the first one can technology
hack the city yes I would say this maybe
high density buildings but it definitely
is hacking the city this is not urbane
this is just a tall building with high
density
this is Songdo high tech city this is
not clear to me what this is is this
truly urban I&#39;m not so sure this to me
is a kind of the high tech city there&#39;s
a kind of hacking of the city there are
many more examples by the way but can
the city hack technology yes this is an
old oil rig and it&#39;s sort of an ocean
mini city and imagine all the old high
rate but of course there are many more
ways think of a car made for speed and
distance on the highway it arrives at
the center of the city with a lot of
traffic and it is reduced to a little
crawling worm the car the city has
hacked the engineers design for that car
that is a way of hacking technology more
generally I think that three sort of
talked back and they do that in many
different ways one of the things that
I&#39;m exploring now is the notion that
cities actually have speech and I began
to think about this when we pass our
Supreme Court gave speech to
corporations you know which means that
they can put in money for election and
so you know the city clearly is not
doesn&#39;t have our kind of talk but I I
was reminded of a something that that
was the case in New York City years ago
when New York was actually bankrupt it
was a dangerous city there is a big part
in the northwest in the upper as they
follow the Upper West Side
Riverside Park a part that is now
beautiful the part was then in the 80s
with the site of murders and and rape
the 80s was also a time there was a
whole new crowd of people coming into
the city they were highly educated young
people professionals and they were going
straight for Wall Street the new kind of
Wall Street small specialized not the
old fashions not the insurance and the
Big Bang the kind of new world of
finance and what I want to describe is
something that to me is a kind of
solution of the prisoner&#39;s dilemma
so these people I these beautiful
buildings and a whole bunch of them
bought places on Riverside Park
but Riverside Park was very dangerous
what you do in New York when you have ah
you know when you live in a dangerous
place you buy a dog but these dogs were
this tall you could literally look them
in the eye when you have a dog what
happens you have to walk the dog every
day every morning every night and dog
seem to have some sort of clock maybe
there is a biologist and knows better
but they&#39;d like to be walked in the
morning evidently or maybe we have
imposed that on them I really don&#39;t know
but so what happens when all these
people go into the park walk in there
big dogs other people begin to feel safe
in the park as well so it is a mix of
people&#39;s practices and these people may
be extremely selfish it doesn&#39;t matter
but their practices connected to urban
space which produces a public good the
park is suddenly safe and that to me is
a kind of speech Act there are many many
more such instances that I&#39;m looking at
now the high tech city threatens the
evolution of cities in the sense of it
produces maybe complex systems attack
clothes so one could then ask why does
it matter that we keep cities complex
but incomplete one there are many many
reasons I&#39;m just going to give you a few
one reason is this absoluteness of these
buildings if the technology is really
the innards of the city and the rate of
obsolescence is increasing we get this
these are all real buildings by the way
and they&#39;re still standing I just want
to clarify I just realized some people I
think oh my god a whole city collapse
but that is a scenario this is Chinese
artists who got a bit fed up with
7,000 new high-rise buildings that were
built in Shanghai in a period of about
five years I think if I were in China
and an artist I think I would also come
out with this so this is sort of one
scenario now it&#39;s what would happen in
the real world is not as dramatic as
this it would be big and pieces of this
kind of process but there are other
reasons and I think that here I want to
move sort of in in a larger historical
condition if you want that we all live
and a lot of what happens in our world
today is the encounter between huge
technical systems in sort of the living
conditions of everyday people now
something I&#39;ve been doing research on is
the new surveillance system and in the
United States in the Netherlands in
Germany in the UK this is not about
traffic speed this is not about you know
whatever the little things and trains
and no this is serious stuff now the
city a bit messy a bit anarchic is the
space that historically has been a space
where those without power get to execute
a project they get to make a history
where immigrants arrive they also solve
the prisoner&#39;s dilemma by you know
upgrading their neighborhoods they
create a sub economy you know the
capacity of urban space to enable where
those who like gays and queers who were
not accepted could actually develop the
projects of getting us accepted is it a
surprise that most minority people tend
to live in our big cities now the
surveillance system it&#39;s a new
surveillance system it has existed just
you know for about eight years this is
what we know 10,000 buildings almost
10,000 buildings what we don&#39;t know is
what we don&#39;t know the usual dilemma
this is full time surveillance and this
is not my data by the way this is data
that you know it
it&#39;s collected by a whole diversity of
entities and 90% of us are having our
email etc etc it&#39;s all being collected
we&#39;re not under threat it&#39;s not a
turnkey you know system but what it is
it&#39;s the search for those five or seven
terrorists at any given moment I guess
but for that to function we we the
citizens we those who live in the
country or have to be suspect the logic
of the system is that for our security
we have to be suspect very disturbing
and it&#39;s not going away
on the contrary this is expanding my
question what are the spaces where we
can actually we can&#39;t contest this major
technical system we can&#39;t the Twitter
list places where we can sort of create
a bit of distance between it and and I
think cities are those spaces but not
perfect technological systems that you
know are like tech space cities which I
live cities which have contradictions
one image that I have is that the logic
of the engineer and I adore engineers is
not about engineers hat but advert the
logic of the engineer and the logic of
the citizen of the user of the
technology of the person who dwells in
that environment are actually quite
different in a high-tech city the logic
of the engineer will dominate will it
give us a little room to spoil it to
hack the technology to in it well in one
of our complex cities no matter how high
the technology is but not it&#39;s
overwhelming it&#39;s all occurs I would say
we can still execute our projects we can
sort of unsettle the technology and in
the end the image that comes to my mind
is the image of a kind of open source
urbanism we are going to be using more
and more
it&#39;s going to be inhabiting all kinds of
aspects of these cities there is no no
doubt about that but these hundreds of
cities that are being built there are
literally closed technical systems I
don&#39;t know and I may not be alive when
they collapse but I think there will be
a different type of space there will not
be much room for that kind of divergence
between the logic of the engineer and
the logic of the user the logic
extending further of the inhabitant so
in that sense we have to find a way to
keep our cities yes
complex but incomplete and again think
think of all these firms that they come
on enormous power and they go under
think of Republic&#39;s up the Empire
Istanbul built I don&#39;t know how many
times destroyed burned to the ground
that is an extraordinary capability and
so so for me the city is when I when I
say for instance that the city has
speech cities have enormous ly complex
capability in the work that I do on
finance and specialised services one of
the things that that I have found is
that in global cities you have a kind of
production of something that I call
urban knowledge capital and knowledge
that is more than the sum of all the
knowledge --is in the head of the
brilliant creative class is a term that
I don&#39;t particularly like by the way but
you know a knowledge that is more than
the sum of all the specialized firms
that is again that intermediation the
city as actually a fight that has speech
that has its own way of talking back but
while historically this has all worked
very well I I am not so sure with it
extraordinarily powerful
close technical
systems and an enormous business sector
behind that that is going to be
generating and how already has a bit
generating very very vast profits so in
that sense keeping our cities complex
but incomplete is I think essential
otherwise we will have a lot of dead
obsolete cities thank you very much
[Applause]
