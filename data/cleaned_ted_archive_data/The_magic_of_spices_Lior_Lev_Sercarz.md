so I love spices I really do and I hope
that in less than six minutes from now
maybe you would like them a little bit
or give them a little chance that they
deserve the question is why spices well
it&#39;s very simple spices add flavor to
food now if you&#39;re from the people who
don&#39;t like food with flavor or tasteless
or boring bathroom break right now is a
good idea or in five and a half minutes
I&#39;m gone let&#39;s forget about this whole
conversation
but if you do like food with flavor
stick around for a minute you might
learn something
I didn&#39;t start cooking because I had
this poetic grandmother that knew a lot
of things she was an awesome grandmother
but cooking was not her forte by far my
mother back in Israel was just working
late so I had to cook dinner very often
I later on ended up in a cooking school
in France went on to work for some very
famous chefs a little bit all over and
landed a job here in New York about
eleven years ago for the near Budi I&#39;ve
learned a lot from the near one of the
main things that I learned that
restaurant was not my call in life so
what would be my call in life maybe
spices would and again why spices out of
everything
well we spoke about flavor but for the
sea for the 20 years or so that I worked
in kitchens is that my colleagues and
chefs and bosses and people even at home
were seriously afraid of spices for no
reason and mistakingly saying very often
I don&#39;t like spicy food well what they
meant is I don&#39;t like hot food and I
thought maybe by making spice blends I
can encourage you guys here to use more
spices and bring some fun back to your
food so if we need a blend how do you
make a blend well here&#39;s a little
insight about my world well every blend
needs a story my mentor and good friend
Oliver addresses that you need to
describe every creation in life by once
upon a time otherwise it&#39;s pointless
and I&#39;m with him so once upon a time
please meet this dude in the middle Pere
Poirot or Peter pepper if you translate
it into English so let&#39;s honor him and
make a pepper blend why because pure
amongst our eating smuggles plants from
the Dutch and Portuguese few hundred
years ago and plants them all over the
world and these days we can all enjoy
spices without any monopoly so Pierre is
gonna be our hero for the spaceman what
do we need well we need a cast we need
some actors so here is our cast peppers
from all over the world green and white
and pink and red the best quality that
you can get step one we have a cast then
we&#39;re going to measure them and scale
them because if this works well well
you&#39;ll ask me again for it and I do not
need to know how to make it so we&#39;re
gonna scale them next thing that we&#39;re
gonna do we&#39;re going to toast them a
little bit kind of release their
essential oils and warm them up to each
other they&#39;re gonna sit in that jar for
quite a while together better get
familiar like you guys with the people
you just met tonight very important that
they get along after we warm them up to
each other and they get more friendly
we&#39;re gonna grind them we&#39;re gonna use
different pepper grinders and we&#39;re
gonna coarsely grind and finely grind we
want to achieve texture in that blend
that we&#39;re gonna do so we grind them and
everything is going well and we&#39;re
mixing them in a ball now most people
are say awesome let&#39;s start cooking this
is where I say don&#39;t do anything stop
put them in a jar put a lid and walk
away I want to walk away for an hour a
day even a month sometimes and the
reason being is this this is such an
intense process I want to come back with
a fresh perspective see what just
happened here apply my senses to this
whole project look at that
first of all these visuals you&#39;d want to
cook with something that looks good it&#39;s
colorful then we&#39;re gonna pop off this
jar lid and we&#39;re gonna smell these
beautiful pine aromas and sweet and
Fleur that&#39;s gonna get us really excited
then we&#39;re gonna taste them this is not
a pop who read this is gonna go into
your dishes so we want to make sure that
they&#39;re hot or sweet or sour or savory
then we&#39;re also gonna listen to the way
that they crack when you start eating
them or when you drop them on a surface
this is very important you don&#39;t want to
be that loud guy in the restaurant that
chewing on that spice blend last but not
least is texture and the way we grabbed
him from the jar how much we&#39;re gonna
take I had a couple fighting at the
store not too long ago his food was
apparently over-salted
long story short his fingers were double
of mine he was using fine salt the
scrubbing way too much salt I
recommended coarse salt
end of story they&#39;re a happy couple
and these food tastes much better
texture it is very important so assuming
we went and we did this great awesome
blend what do we do with it now well you
tell me what you want to do with it I
usually like to have a drink
so I&#39;ll mix it into some bubbles or some
wine and make myself an awesome spice
drink you can make yourself a salad you
can season fish you can do whatever you
want with spices you don&#39;t even have to
cook you can order in and sprinkle
spices there&#39;s no police car outside
that&#39;s gonna arrest you for that just
enjoy them your food will never taste
the same again
trust me beside the fact that apparently
it&#39;s even healthier for you now I don&#39;t
cook with my mother back in Israel as
often as I would like to anymore but I
do have an extended family here in the
US and aside from the fact that they&#39;re
very excited that I married their
daughter my father-in-law is super
excited that his food tastes better
since we met so as your new spice
advisor or consultant on therapists if
you will go home open that dark place in
your kitchen called spice cabinet some
of the things in there should not be in
there and the rest should be used
you&#39;re gonna bring flavor into your food
and mainly love these spices giving them
the place that they deserve let&#39;s just
bring family back to cooking thank you
very much
[Applause]
