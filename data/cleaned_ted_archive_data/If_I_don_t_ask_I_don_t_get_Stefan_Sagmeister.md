so all about
fifteen years ago Richards old woman the
guy who found that this and the reason
we are actually all sitting around here
asked me to design 70 posters for Ted
for free and it was such a gigantic
amount of worth of work that I really
had to say no to him a week later he
calls me on the phone and he says Stefan
you owe me five minutes late or or that
go into a room where there&#39;s nobody else
where it&#39;s just you and the phone when I
do and said now close your eyes and
picture me naked
I don&#39;t know I&#39;m fat that it&#39;s an ugly
sight a picture me naked and now picture
me going down on my knees in front of
you and I put my hands on the floor and
I put my head on the floor and I come
slowly back up and I say I beg you do
these posters for me
[Music]
[Applause]
so I did hated every second of it I had
to do them myself it was my handwriting
so I couldn&#39;t give them to an intern and
a number of years later we spoke at the
same conference in Tokyo and we ran into
each other after a conference at Narita
Airport and I complained to him that I
was stupid enough to allow the
conference to fly me in coach and I had
to go back now and fold myself into this
tiny seat for 14 hours and I said I&#39;m
sure you weren&#39;t that stupid I&#39;m sure
you forced you force them to fly your
business and Richard said oh no no no or
I don&#39;t fly business oh I only fly first
oh and I said well you Richard oh
and you know you know went to the
bookstore or something and uh attacking
I got my ticket back-end while I was
looking for my C that looked at my seed
assignment and I said it said number 1 B
and there is Richard in 1a in first
class and what happened was that after
we had talked he went back outside into
check-in and he told the Japanese
airline check-in lady that he just ran
into his long-lost son that his bitch
ex-wife never lets him see and the only
way to reunify was his son would be if
she upgrades me
so now we had 14 hours for him to tell
me his life moto and the one sentence
that he built all dead on and we made a
little video about that can turn or turn
up the sound - and down the lights on
the stage

you so much Richard
