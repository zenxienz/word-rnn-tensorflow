I am thanks very much I haven&#39;t done
many talks before but I&#39;ve just left
perfect waves in Islands a beer today so
I said any surf will know that some it&#39;s
a bit of a nightmare so I hope you enjoy
my story okay I grew up in the coast in
England you know I started surfing about
eight and I very quickly knew that it
was something that I wanted it to be in
my life forever and when I was leaving
school I I sort of said this to my
career&#39;s officer and then sir things not
that conventional and it just didn&#39;t fit
in with the boxes that I&#39;ve got got you
know provided so I ended up being a
plumber and after my college course I
very quickly realised working as a
plumber that my heart and soul just
didn&#39;t lie in the toilet or in pipes so
I began my mission to basically make
surfing my job and what I did is I got a
job in a circle factory I worked in a
surf shop I became a lifeguard and
worked on the beach and this all enabled
me to travel every winter and it was
through traveling in the winter that I
found my niche and surfing and it was I
wasn&#39;t the best small wave surfer but
when waves got big I just seemed to
excel and guys that were a lot better
than me at surfing in small waves they
were getting scared I was sort of coming
into my element so it was it was I came
back when winter and I&#39;ve been watching
YouTube with some guys in Hawaii and
they were getting towed into waves like
huge waves on jet skis and it&#39;s one
thing that inspired when I thought oh I
want to try that and so I went to Island
met with my friends we got a jet ski and
then this is me driving the jet ski and
this is the first time we ever won out
and as you can see I was I was never a
natural and and there&#39;s a lot harder
than it looked
but we after that accident we kept on
we&#39;d be persevered we trained and we
start we started to get a lot better and
this is actually me surfing this time
and this is a wallet probably the the
the biggest waves I&#39;ve caught an island
definitely one of the most heaviest so
as you can see I didn&#39;t make that one
out so it happens to me a lot but this
is it&#39;s funny like so this is a big wave
and there&#39;s a surfer on it that&#39;s me
there swimming that&#39;s not intentional I
fell off from the wave before and my jet
ski driver couldn&#39;t pick me up and at
this point here this is like what you
trained for this is when you have to
believe in yourself and this is also
probably the most scariest situation
you&#39;ll be faced with you know that&#39;s a
big wave it&#39;s about to break in my head
but that&#39;s when you have to to really
believe in yourself and and not panic
think about your training you&#39;ve done
and and that&#39;s what will get you through
those sort of situations so obviously
I&#39;ve surfed a lot of big waves and I was
really fortunate to get a good break and
I got some sponsorship which enabled me
to surf more and work a little bit less
but it was it was at this point when I
actually lost all my sponsorship a
couple years ago and then and at this
point I&#39;ve been married for a few years
I have two kids and I sat with my wife
in the kitchen table and sort said okay
well you know there&#39;s a lot of pressure
for me to provide for my family but also
get a steady income and a job and and I
supposed to care so what should I do and
thinking that she probably said well
you&#39;ve got a you know pick up this
banner again and get perhaps a plumbing
and and she just looked at me said well
what do you really want to do and I sort
of said all straightaway as I want to
surf up the biggest waves in the world
and she said well you just have to make
that happen then and and it was from
that point there that with I came up
with a project with one of my friends it
was called behind the lines and we plan
to document a winter chasing big waves
in Europe and
we managed to get some funding for it
which enabled us to travel all that
winter and it was it just happened so
that that winter we had an incredible
amount of storms in the Atlantic and on
the 2nd of February there was a huge
storm which we knew would create some of
the biggest ways we&#39;ve ever seen in
Portugal and Nazare and we headed down
there and it was giant and we had like a
four-hour session and that for hours out
to sea y&#39;all caught one wave and this
this next video is just about about that
wave toggle way it&#39;s wet enough that it
was like wasn&#39;t wires rollers definitely
I kind of kick from the cannon coming
sideways there&#39;s a legend
[Applause]
so some people don&#39;t seem to have the
concept of following your heart your
dream or your passion but but for me it
is I just had to believe thank you
[Applause]
