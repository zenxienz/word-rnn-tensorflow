good morning I want to start by inviting
you on a journey across space and time
in the next century beyond our solar
system moving toward another star but
I&#39;m getting ahead of myself I need to
first of all tell you why I believe
pursuing an extraordinary tomorrow
that is human interstellar travel is
really necessary in order for us to
build a better world today and the
reason it&#39;s necessary is because it
fosters radical leaps radical leaps in
innovation in technology and our
knowledge and understanding of the
universe our knowledge and understanding
of ourselves and today right now we
desperately need those kinds of radical
leaps to talk about this I&#39;m gonna go
back to when I was growing up in the
1960s it was an incredible time it
seemed like our potential was limitless
everywhere we looked new things were
happening right there was a new particle
discovered there was people were doing
things differently when you think about
the 60s everybody always talks about the
60s as being a time of anarchy but
really I was a little girl through the
60s and what I remember about them was
if everybody wanted to participate and
they thought they had a right to
participate in the world when we look at
the civil rights movement and D
colonialization across the world and
women&#39;s rights and all of those things
that was about pretty saying that we
could participate these were really
radical changes we looked at
entertainment Judith Jamison I wanted to
dance like her I wanted to grow up to be
a dancer
Star Trek original series Star Trek fan
it said that we could get past our
nuclear war and all the things that were
happening then computers were coming
online we&#39;re really starting to get on
semiconductors and of course we landed
on the moon which has been one of those
themes that happened because space
exploration then became a part of our
everyday lives
we thought of space exploration and it
impacted me
it made a difference in my world I went
on and did other things I started as an
MD and an engineer and other things and
I&#39;ve been assited Environmental Studies
professor but space exploration was
there was always something I wanted to
do because it was one of these stretches
really far and when you think about
space exploration it impacted everybody
because this picture you know we always
are looking now at orbital sunrises
right everybody knows that we&#39;re on this
planet Earth but the question I have to
ask now what are we today going to do to
contribute to those same kinds of
radical leaps Frantz Fanon a martinique
and psychiatrist said each generation
must out of relative obscurity discover
its mission fulfill it or betray it we
have to figure out what we&#39;re going to
do with those radical leaps and how
we&#39;re gonna get there but I guess first
we actually have to talk about what is a
radical leap hmm I think of it as a
product a concept an idea goods or
services something that we can change
the world something that actually
transforms us from one generation to a
next something we can&#39;t go back for it
can be a policy a decision think of the
kinds of things that are radical leaps
they cause discontinuities in the way
things were you can&#39;t kill them because
they&#39;re there we can actually remember
them germ theory Surratt achill leave
right the wheel the light bulb those are
radical leaps right if you start to look
at things like how do we get to the hip
hop with a Grammys because of the lost
poets and Gil scott-heron talking about
the revolution will not be televised
these are things that build up on each
other
when we look at radical leaps in
mathematics so we can start counting on
our toes right then we get to an abacus
then we can get to a computer these are
things that are discontinuities these
are changes that happen radical leaps
some people want to have their hair
straight permanently some people want to
have their hair curly permanently
permanence for a lot of people were
radical leap right and technology and
how do we see over the world so these
things can be daily activities they can
be things that happen very frequently
why do we need them
because of the overwhelming challenges
that we face in the world today can&#39;t be
solved through incremental ISM there&#39;s
tiny baby steps when we talk about the
issue of climate change when we talk
about the loss of biodiversity when we
talk about needing to feed everyone when
we talk about why we have so much war
when we talk about toxins that are in
the environment when we talk about
wanting to include everyone and the
bounty of this world they can&#39;t be
solved with baby lis baby steps in
incrementalism we have to do something
much bigger but let me just do a one
quick word about radical leaps in
incrementalism radical leaps are always
good right there can be policies that
are put into place
there can be things that we do there can
be weapons that we create that are not
always wonderful they&#39;re radically but
they&#39;re not always wonderful it&#39;s who&#39;s
creating the technology that makes the
difference is who&#39;s creating the policy
that makes a difference and incremental
ism we have to be careful because right
now we&#39;re building our world on a lot of
the work that was done in the 50s and
the 60s that&#39;s what&#39;s moving us forward
and we&#39;re making incremental
improvements on it and we pay for
incremental improvements that&#39;s how we
get profits right so our profitability
we want to be able to make sure that
it&#39;s going to happen right we want to be
able to predict it and we benefit from
it so we have to be really careful
incremental ism is important sometimes
but we need to do a little differently
the question is what actually holds us
back why aren&#39;t we doing bigger things
why don&#39;t we do bigger things as
governments as people as individuals
I think the first answer is people the
perceptions of who has a solution so
many times we want to go to the same
people for the solutions over and over
again right but we have to have
different people than these teams but
we&#39;re sometimes afraid to have different
people in the teams we&#39;re very fearful
that someone might get ahead of us right
so if we open a door if we go someplace
someone may get ahead of us and fear is
particularly powerful when we think
we&#39;re going to lose something right we
have to be able to get beyond that fear
keeps us from doing stuff we&#39;re afraid
that we may fail
but all of those things keep us from
taking these risks and I think one of
the biggest ones is also looking back we
look back to the greatest generation
right we look back to the glory days of
Apollo we have to be able to do more
than that we have to be able to look
forward we learn the lessons from the
past we build up on them but we don&#39;t
sit transfixed with them so how do we
generate radical leaps we do it by first
of all assembling a team that&#39;s
transdisciplinary because none of the
problems that because none of the
problems that we have today can actually
be solved by just one discipline they
have to be built up across a number of
different disciplines we also have to
make sure that we choose a problem
that&#39;s difficult enough one that we
don&#39;t know how to do very easily right
and then we have to understand that it&#39;s
going to require commitment so the
problem also has to be one that people
can feel comfortable and connected with
those are the things we need to do and
so of course the work that I&#39;m doing
right now and leading 100 year starship
is really about pursuing and
extraordinary tomorrow in order to
create a better world today we believe
pursuing the extraordinary is what
creates a better world today when we
look at some radical leaps in space so
you can start saying well what are we
going to do in space I want to give you
a couple of data points before we go on
if we start to look at some data points
the moon landing was in 1969 I hear
people talking all the time about we
need to do a moon shot right that&#39;s
that&#39;s the that&#39;s the buzzword now moon
landing happened in 69 to really
appreciate the discontinuity between it
you need to be 54 years old or more
let&#39;s say you were seven or eight six
seven eight years old right you might be
able to appreciate it Sputnik moments
people talk about a weird need to have a
Sputnik moment right to appreciate a
Sputnik moment when a Sputnik 1957 he
just be 68 years old plus or minus so
think about it when we&#39;re using these
terms we keep looking back do those
terms have the energy that they&#39;ve
seem to have for some of us the US
population right now only 12% 13% or 65
are older
the median age is 38 the u.s. population
20 percent of it is our 25 percent of it
is under 20 years of age so that means
when we&#39;re talking about these things we
have to recognize that for the time that
most of these people most of the people
in the world have been alive we were
already on the moon it&#39;s not that same
big whoop it was when I was a little kid
it&#39;s a difference right that they&#39;ve
seen the moons of Saturn and I have this
picture of this great Rover on Mars
because we&#39;ve been on Mars for all their
lifetime so when we start talking about
Mars as a journey we know how to do Mars
we know where it lives right there are
some engineering challenges that are
associated with it but we could write
out how to do that this is an issue that
we have to think about how do you grab
something that&#39;s going to capture us
going into the future this is a picture
of me on the space shuttle so if I
didn&#39;t tell you that if you didn&#39;t know
who I was or if you weren&#39;t really like
a space cake this almost looks like it
could be a picture in the International
Space Station right yes so we&#39;re doing
space very the same way in order to be
able to do space so we can get to
interstellar it has to be
transformational it&#39;ll be the difference
between being on the shuttle and being
on the bridge of enterprise now we&#39;re
not going to necessarily meet Worf but
it&#39;s that kind of transformational thing
let me tell you about how difficult it
is and understand the interstellar
travel
you put three grains of sand in the
cathedral and that Cathedral is more
packed with sand and spaces with stars
the issues that we look at are actually
the distance things are very far apart
it means that it&#39;s going to take a very
long time to get anyplace right the time
and distance makes a difference and then
that means you have to be autonomy
autonomous because you can&#39;t send back
from supplies or groceries right you&#39;re
not gonna necessarily slow down so you
have to understand all of these issues
around sustainability and then when you
go into space just think about it 90% of
this dark right we all know what&#39;s going
on in 90
Sinemet how do we look at this and so
it&#39;s the extreme nature of these hurdles
that really makes a difference that&#39;s
what pushes us that&#39;s what drives the
research that&#39;s what makes us think list
of all the kinds of things that happen
that we have to do whether you talk
about having much better energy supplies
being able to understand the microbiome
that you have to take with you all those
little microbes ago on your body whether
or not you have to talk about ecosystems
and manufacturing breaks through
sustainability all of those things are
really big but I believe perhaps the
biggest issue we have to face is human
behavior how do we behave because we
could get so far out and we could do all
the technological work but unless our
behavior changes you know the 10 years
out almost to the start somebody&#39;s gonna
say well I&#39;m not doing what you told me
to do because you&#39;re not in charge and I
don&#39;t particularly like you but we can
start to look at human behavior now that
is one of the issues because everything
that&#39;s required for an interstellar
journey are the same things that are
required to support our life form here
on earth so I&#39;m just going to go through
it again what we do with 100 year
starship is really about inclusion
because we want to have the right teams
we have people from textile designers to
science fiction authors to biomedical
engineering professors to people who are
in religion all the gamut of things
because a problem is that big when we
start to think about radical leaps we
have to be audacious space exploration
is supposed to be bold people don&#39;t want
you taking timid steps they want us
doing something bigger than we&#39;ve done
before we need to have that adrenaline
rush as humans that&#39;s where we need to
go if we think about this this is a
journey that we&#39;ve been on for hundreds
of generations for thousands of years
because space exploration is actually
built on the first people who looked up
and said you know what those points of
light are moving and they figured out
what the relationship was that&#39;s what
we&#39;re building on now so it&#39;s a common
theme throughout our history it&#39;s a
journey that we have to commit to
when you look at radical leaps they have
to be transformative so the whole issue
about 100 year starship is not about
going and launching a mission in fact
when we receive the seed funding grant
from DARPA
to work on this it was really about how
do you get the innovation that&#39;s gonna
transform life here on earth and make
things better and that&#39;s the other part
of it what what are we doing it&#39;s about
life here on earth the full range of
life not just one part not just one
thing it&#39;s not just about the rocket
engines it&#39;s about who we are as a
people because in fact if we figured if
this all out and we got all the energy
done and we didn&#39;t in the work on our
behavior our human behavior our caring
how we interact with each other then we
would use that that energy system for
weaponry which would leave us in a whole
nother calaf ish it&#39;s about being on
earth it&#39;s about seeing ourselves as
earthlings because the reality is the
most of us are not going to get off this
planet our grandchildren our
grandchildren&#39;s grandchildren are not
going to get off this planet we&#39;re going
to have to figure out how to be here
ourselves and this is about thinking
beyond into the future that we are
connected that we can move further that
everything that we do is impacting us so
100 year starship is really an inclusive
audacious journey to transform life here
on earth and beyond we believe that
there is a better future for us but in
order for us to get there we have to
have an inspiring inclusive collective
ambition for Humanity that&#39;s where we&#39;re
really moving and going Eugene Cernan
said we went to explore the moon and in
fact we discovered the earth the
question I would ask is what we would
discover from another star and finally
because this seems so deep because it
seems like sometimes when we&#39;re working
on things
Cynthia Hamel said when in doubt make a
fool of yourself there&#39;s a
microscopically thin line between being
the most gigantic idiot on earth and
being considered brilliant so what the
hell
leap radical leaps thank you very much
thank you very much so
you talked about some audacious things
there could you tell us a little bit
about in that human behavior piece that
you&#39;re focusing on what are the biggest
challenges in that area so when we think
about human behavior here on earth so
100 year starship is really about
capabilities making sure capabilities
exist and when you think about it yes we
can talk about food we can talk about
things like that
but it&#39;s really how do we see each other
how do we commit to long term product
projects how do we invest in a future
that we may not see so many times we
become short-sighted and everything is
about what I&#39;m going to get right now
today so how do we move forward and I
think that&#39;s one of the big investments
I&#39;m struck by the fact when we talk
about food and agriculture everyone says
their people are hungry on earth but yet
right now we generate enough food to
feed everyone on this planet right now
yet we waste over 40 percent of the food
that we have in United States it&#39;s an
issue about sharing and the thing that
100 year starship and when we start to
look at interstellar and going someplace
else what it does is helps us to use and
understand that we&#39;re in this one place
this one environment and can we see
ourselves as a starship we have to think
about it as how do we share these things
absolutely and so tell me a little bit
about why it&#39;s important to think not
just about the technology but about the
people we got to get out of the way why
to think about not just the physical
stuff right because the the metal the
pieces of things because first of all
people make those things and for 100
year starship again we&#39;re looking at the
capabilities and how do we apply them to
life here on earth think about it if we
don&#39;t figure out how to create financial
investment vehicles for the long term
we&#39;ll never get things done if we don&#39;t
figure out how to work in teams we&#39;re
never going to get things done if we
can&#39;t figure out how people can have
different religions and be and
same rule and be on the same planet look
how big this planet is and we can&#39;t
figure it out so if you looked at a
starship we&#39;d have to think about those
things how do we move them forward
absolutely well thank you so much let&#39;s
thank me again
