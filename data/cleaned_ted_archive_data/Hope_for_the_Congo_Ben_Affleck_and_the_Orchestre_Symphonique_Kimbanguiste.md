hello hi ah thank you it&#39;s good yeah I
like it so you have a great weekend how
can I start with anything but
congratulations thank you very much yeah
we I was joking that although he won for
producer I felt that we all gave it to
him for directors as well I felt that I
could well thank you thank you yeah um
so you&#39;ve been with us all day here at
Ted yeah what spit out for you well you
know they told me listen you came you
were at the Academy Awards now you&#39;re
coming to the Academy Awards for smart
people so I thought okay alright I&#39;m
better get it together I don&#39;t know if
I&#39;m that smart but Kadim E award smart
but I showed up and I had a chance to to
watch some of the previous talks which
was really exciting there were a lot of
extraordinary people there wasn&#39;t I for
one man I don&#39;t know if you were the
folks in the audience for this who was
doing it first of all there was a guy
who was having sex with dead animals
which was interesting and then Adam
edifying
don&#39;t let that out if you want to hang
on to the smart people academy and then
there was a guy who pulled the audience
and wanted to know how many of the men
in relationships thought that their wife
was much louder than they were in the
sack during sex it&#39;s a good question not
a no it&#39;s true and every single man in
this audience was like yes yes way way
louder than me and you think not only
are you all brilliant but somehow you&#39;re
like everyone he was crushing it as I&#39;m
sad like I am sticking around here and
we start polling people we are
multi-talented here because apparently
okay there&#39;s a line at the smart people
line we often joke the last session on
Thursday is sort of crazy sexy Ted but
maybe we&#39;ll do so we bless believe I
lived up to that oh I saw that
yeah the guys having sex with the
gerbils that&#39;s 2014 that&#39;s true right
that&#39;s right that was not that right
well they&#39;re just such a delight to have
you here thank you very much and I will
I will leave you to your introduction
okay my search will be very brief I just
want to be clear from the
starts this is not a TED talk I will not
be interesting I will not be funny I
will not be memorable nothing about this
it will be viral it will not be
particularly exciting in any way now
that we&#39;ve established that I think you
know this is going to meet your
expectations perfectly you know when I
was at the when I was at the I feel a
little bit like Al Gore with a headset
you know what I mean a little like
climate change is no joke he&#39;s not here
is he brother so I can do Bill Gates to
see here there is nothing wrong with
mist up there you go that was it yeah
yeah it was just to take a little heat
off al here&#39;s the thing at the Academy
Awards last week some of you may have
saw most of you probably at home like
working on the warp drive and my wife
and I said that you know the people that
we love we we have to work on those
relationships and that&#39;s how in fact we
show that we love one another by the
time that we invest by what we give and
I&#39;m very lucky I have an incredible wife
and she is engaged with me in that and
that way and the other thing that I that
I work on that I spend my time on is the
eastern Congo now I don&#39;t have very long
so I&#39;ll try to be brief but basically
what happened to me was I felt like I
wasn&#39;t doing enough to give back to the
world I looked down I found one of the
most damaged
you know suffering places I thought in
the world I found that one in five
children there would die before the age
of five it was a pretty regular thing
that you&#39;d find more than a million
people displaced inside the country it
was a probably place that you would find
some of the worst sexually based
gender-based sexual violence in the
world where women were raped often
repeatedly with you know brickbats and
glass and bottles and terrible terrible
things suffering fistulas to the extent
that local hospitals couldn&#39;t keep up a
place where there is essentially
complete impunity for some of the
twenty-five odd recognized armed
militias because there is no real state
security sector particularly in the East
there are a lot of things to lament
particularly in the last 15 years about
five and a half million people have died
who otherwise would not have from from
conflict and conflict related causes
mostly starvation and present a
preventable disease so that&#39;s five and a
half million in 15 years right so that&#39;s
a lot now some people have taken
exception to that methodology and I&#39;ve
said well no you know really it&#39;s a
you&#39;re judging against the wrong African
country really it&#39;s four and a half
million or really it&#39;s four million well
how about this let&#39;s say it&#39;s three
million how about that and we can maybe
all agree on three million people I&#39;m
not sure it makes it better
but it means that per capita it&#39;s
roughly the equivalent of twelve million
people in the United States who would
have died over the last fifteen years
which would be if you take the cities
themselves the equivalent of Chicago
Boston and Philadelphia
now if over the last 15 years Chicago
Boston and Philadelphia had every single
person who lived there died we probably
take some steps it would probably be
some reaction it would be reaction to
that to be reaction from Western Europe
dead reaction of North America of us
from South America there would be
reaction from Africa people would know
about it so so what haven&#39;t we responded
to what&#39;s happening in Congo I think
it&#39;s tricky because I think we are a
naturally good people we care about one
another when our neighbor has cancer we
go over there with with meatloaf we
babysit for their kids if someone&#39;s a
friend of ours house burns down we take
them in we do little collection tins at
grocery stores you know in corner stores
we care about one another we care about
our neighbors and we recognize the
connection between all living things but
I think this is my theory what happens
between a place like this and a place
like like Congo is that we feel it&#39;s too
big it&#39;s too difficult to look at how do
you put in your head three million
people I can understand one person who I
know I love I going to stay my aunt who
passed away I can understand the
profound pain at that
also I can understand three million I
can&#39;t I don&#39;t want to understand the the
way that women are being raped and
violet it&#39;s just too painful so I want
to disengage and the way that I
disengage is by saying it&#39;s intractable
it&#39;s not solvable the people there have
been destroyed to the extent that they
have lost their ability to govern
themselves to regulate themselves people
often say with great you know I think it
was Thomas painters that indifference
clad and wisdoms guys they&#39;ll tell you
it I often get lectured you know it&#39;s
too corrupt you don&#39;t understand how it
is down there nobody can get it together
it&#39;s a way if there&#39;s good money after
bad it&#39;s a sinkhole it&#39;s the same Jesse
Helms ideas that have been passed down a
decade over a decade I don&#39;t believe
that&#39;s true I&#39;ve seen and met people
doing extraordinary things I&#39;ve seen
people who are mending the fabric of
their lives and their their families
lives in their society brick by brick
stitch by stitch I&#39;ve seen it I&#39;ve met
the people and it&#39;s moved me and it&#39;s
changed my views on what&#39;s possible on
what&#39;s doable not only by the people who
are in the midst of this terrible
maelstrom of suffering and pain but also
the role that we have to play in
extending a hand which as we all know is
the only decent thing to do so tonight
you&#39;re going to get to see or this
afternoon somebody else&#39;s work not my
work and and they&#39;re pretty incredible
and I hope is that when you connect with
them you&#39;ll start to see more of that
hope for yourself so here you hear here
they are here you have it that&#39;s the cue
for the lights there you go you can
combine it a symphony orchestra it&#39;s
going to play a composition that they&#39;re
from Kinshasa from Congo and they&#39;re
going to play a composition written by
the first violinist called Luba which is
basically about the tranquility of the
traditional Congolese village and a
desire to see that tranquility return to
villages all across Congo please take it
away
