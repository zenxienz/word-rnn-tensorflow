hello this is your goal my sous chef and
we are going to talk and cook at the
same time and later you&#39;re going to
taste what we are going to do here and
we are going to talk about this route
manioc which is the most important food
of Brazil this route 12 years ago
changed completely my life as a
professional as a chef but also as a
human being I was invited to a
gastronomic event at the Northeast of
Brazil pen on buku space which is a poor
state and in that event they asked us
you know chefs from real some power to
make food with the regional ingredients
that&#39;s always what they do and always
accept me because they think that we
because we are from the big towns we
know more than the people from local
places but anyway there I went and I
start to look for which recipe I would
do so they gave us a list of all the
regional ingredients and I didn&#39;t know
almost half of the list and I stopped
asking them what&#39;s booba they said that
four men York what&#39;s Kadima that&#39;s also
from any oak what about massa that&#39;s
another thing from maniac and I said
everything here comes from men yuck how
come I didn&#39;t know that hi how come I
was already a 20-year professional chef
and I didn&#39;t know those things so I went
to the kitchen of the hotel I was
supposed to make the dish and I kept
working with that things but I really
didn&#39;t go through so I was a bit upset
the next day
I went for breakfast now they started to
get up pretty early and I went to the
breakfast and I asked for the tapioca
cracked a polka crept up yoga is this a
product of menu and tapioca crap is one
of the wonders of North Eastern cuisine
at that time you could only eat up yoga
crap at that part of Brazil and when the
technical crap came to me to my dish and
I tasted it it was wonderful it was
crispy on the outside creamy with cheese
and spices and herbs from the inside and
I said this person who knows how to cook
so I look at the restaurant and I saw
there in a dark corner there was this
humble cook local cook that was doing
the tapioca crepes and I said maybe this
woman can help me to find my recipe so i
went there and i asked her what&#39;s this
that you using to make the tapioca crap
and she said I said which flower are you
using she said this is not a flower this
is starch but yoga stretch manioc starch
and I said but how do you get that where
does it come from and she said Baptist
in in men your house where they do all
the sub products of men yuck don&#39;t you
know that she was really surprised that
I professional chef didn&#39;t know that and
then I suddenly know she said but have
you never been to many or cows and I
said what is the menu house so she
looked at me really suspicious and
sister she said you are the professional
guys you should visit a maniac house and
I get out of there I made my dish with
tapioca and it worked all right and I
came back to Rio but I was really really
stunned by that thing I was really
thinking how come I didn&#39;t know about
Manuel house how come this is such an
important thing for Brazil everyone eats
menarche all the time in review but it&#39;s
something like consider the poorest
people food
so I start researching manioc and i went
to the internet and i got books and i
asked people and I every time I learned
something new we got bigger and bigger
that was many orc all over the place
manioc was originated from Brazil at the
Amazon many orc had more than one
thousand eight hundred varieties many
many sub products some that people went
to the industry even and I do know all
that so because of that I got some
recipes also I thought learning the
special recipes about many of flour this
one here that yogurt making today is
very very special manual flora from the
Amazon and all sorts of being as in
spices that you&#39;re going to eat later so
because of that i started to be known as
the manual chef manual ambassador many
or anything so I got another invitation
to make this manual class at a
gastronomic University in University in
u.s. in dallas texas so someone told me
you better made a small film to show
what many okies because they&#39;re people
don&#39;t know about menu so with the help
of some friends we made this documentary
about processing manual and people told
me the best way to do that is in the
Abbey Amazon because they are the manual
houses ask you original with all the
tools everything really handmade so
there I went and we made this film for
three days we were there shooting and
for the first time in my life as a chef
I met a farmer I got closer to a farmer
and we started changing ideas about how
many orcas planted how it is processed
and I was really so fascinated by that
was three days of great great work I was
really feeling
tired by the end of the third day of
shooting so I said that this chair and I
slept I was tired and I slept for a
couple of minutes what I didn&#39;t know is
that Mr ben√©t this man York farmer that
called himself the many oak farmer
professor because he said he was one of
the best he was preparing a surprise for
me so when I slept that what he did that
I missed can we see the film now
[Music]
yes
[Music]
[Music]
so this is what he did this is a way of
packing manioc flour the ancient way the
indigenous ways where they use all the
sustainable leaves and fibers the manioc
flour here stays on stay o for one year
and he did that just to show me how the
ancient people do this and he said they
do they don&#39;t do this anymore and I ask
why why not this is a beautiful thing
this is amazing thing and he said no
because I know these people like plastic
so they prefer to have plastic bags and
I was completely shocked I said we must
do something about that and I asked him
how many people know how to do that are
not many people like people do this just
for fun just to remember all time so I
came back to 30 and I was again obsessed
now not only about the strength of
manioc but also about how can we share
help the farmers to maintain their
culture what could we do what could we
help which kind of thing would we do
then at that time some other chefs came
along and they asked me we like what
you&#39;re doing can we help can we make a
group and I said okay let&#39;s make a group
so i made this brand and i called it eco
chefs don&#39;t mistake by the ego chef
which is a much larger group
so the Eco set got together with lots of
ideas and we create this nonprofit
organization called into to maneuver
maneuver is the stem of manioc is the
way it is planted how it grows so we
start doing all sorts of promotion with
manual flower and we got this product to
be to be served in our restaurants in
our gastronomic fairs and all over so
because of the film we got not now his
finishing here are you finishing yeah
yeah okay so we have a little pepper and
now what happened is that we have this
big project to try to help the guys who
make sure nothing but we don&#39;t have the
money for that so we start looking for
the money in a bank made this loan made
this supporters for this program so I
went back to mr. banner place and for
three years we were there making a
program that he was the manioc flour
professor he start teaching in 21
communities around his town how to make
this and surprise he found many more
people that knew how to do it the
granddad the great wonders that they
didn&#39;t do it anymore so would that help
today 10 more many ox flowers professor
do this and we promote it to restaurants
in rio sao paulo belaying amazon so now
they had the increase of five times what
they used to earn and this became like a
trend is like a new trend
and it was really really something that
was magic while I could never imagine
that by just doing this move just
approaching ourselves as chef at with
the farmers we could change a social
reality that for me was a new thing I
was used to make food at my restaurant
not to change communities so the last
voyage I&#39;ve I made the last trip I made
to the Amazon when I go out there I was
feeling a little bit insecure because I
said it really happened he&#39;s got that
going to work and when I got into the
town about the plane a long way and then
when I got into the town they took me
with the van to the place where the
manual house was and when I got into the
manual house I&#39;ve been there many times
I&#39;ve been seeing people doing that
wheezing the basket many times when I
got into the manual house I thought
something that really struck my mind and
told me yes it worked and that&#39;s what I
saw
those two kids they were playing with it
so for me when I saw that I saw that
worked the young people want to know how
to do it they want to do that ancient
culture that was being vanished so the
thing is we cooks have today a great
great power everyone knows that
television shows what everywhere but we
have a greater power to change farmer&#39;s
life and that&#39;s what we really believe
that we could do should do many a small
farming is an endangered activity all
over the world there is no succession
there is no the next generation and
because we can choose what we eat if we
do the right thing all of us can change
this reality eating products from small
farmers and looking for our treasures
everyone here may have a treasure at
home that&#39;s being endangered and that
can vanish so look for your treasures
thank
and maybe some people can sample some of
the delicious this year what&#39;s the name
of it is this is Cassandra Peru is a man
York because the throat arrows were the
guys that went through the country and
they needed to get some easy food so
always the the base of carbohydrates of
manioc flour and some beans and some
vegetables this is a vegetarian version
of it we&#39;re going to try and sneak some
of this outside and yeah yeah the people
get to taste it today so thank you so
much thank you for the job hmm recommend
ok we have a fearless
