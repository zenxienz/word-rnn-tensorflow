so just get everyone on the same page
I&#39;ll start a little bit about a reminder
of what Khan Academy does just to the
gravity this is an age right after Isaac
Newton and you can just see the pleasure
he had can you determine which light
bulb is being switched
I&#39;m totally humidity makes it feel
hotter why is this excellent question
LeBron kind of colors I can come up with
things actually can interbreed although
for these two in particulate seems like
the mechanics would get kind of
difficult but but it&#39;s not just videos
actually most of what we&#39;re focused on
is our as the interactive side of Khan
Academy what you see here is actually
our computer science platform which was
developed by one of the top salt
computer scientists on the planet John
Resig and it&#39;s really to show students
of all ages the the creative side of
programming and we&#39;ve seen it used by
kindergarteners all the way up to
graduate students to do sophisticated
simulations the meat of what we have
been working on this what most of the
team&#39;s been working on is really the
interactive platform our mission is a
free world-class education for anyone
anywhere and we think that doesn&#39;t
happen unless you get deep practice you
get feedback and so what we&#39;re really
doing is we&#39;re using state-of-the-art
analytics so that students get that
feedback get that practice and we have
tools for teachers so that they can keep
track of where the the students actually
are and since that talk at Ted three
years ago the the scale has gotten to
some degree even even crazier for us up
to that point we had reached about seven
million users up to today we&#39;ve reached
about 140 million users at that time we
were eating about reaching about a
million students per month we&#39;re not
reaching about 10 million students per
month and the number of problems that
are have been done on Khan Academy as
you see is rapidly approaching 2 billion
and
the weave as the last TED talk
highlighted a lot of what&#39;s interesting
what we&#39;re doing is what&#39;s happening
inside of classrooms and we&#39;ve started
to see some really really interesting
results and I don&#39;t want to give any
anyone the impression that Khan Academy
is somehow Silver Bullet that you can
just drop into a classroom and
everything is going to be perfect but
when in use conjunct when in conjunction
with amazing teachers who can really set
the right culture for students to take
ownership and really direct their own
learning we have seen some pretty
incredible things happening these are
the percentile scores for a ninth grade
algebra class in Oakland California and
this is actually a classic if you go a
few years before 2011 they were in the
20th percentile of the state of
California and their most recent test
scores not only are they in the 99th
percentile there&#39;s only nine algebra
classes that in all of California that
are that are outperforming them and but
we remind ourselves is still 90 percent
of the users out there are just people
trying to tap into their own potential
and to us this this this next video
exemplifies that
so I actually dropped out of high school
twice both during my freshman year and
when I eventually came back I was put in
sort of lower level math and science
classes because I was so lying then I
discovered Khan Academy and I was able
to skip two years worth of math just
through using the site and I came into
school I took the exam with students who
had been enrolled in the class all year
and I was actually able to get the
highest or the second highest scores in
the class so for me Khan Academy really
changed the trajectory of my entire life
because without it I don&#39;t think I ever
really would have been inspired to to
learn to love
to love science I ended up graduating as
valedictorian and going on to Princeton
where I&#39;m not a computer science major
and I&#39;m absolutely passionate about
learning about computers
[Applause]
they do that so I just like to say a
massive thank you to everyone at Khan
Academy so on the team please keep doing
the good work that you&#39;re doing because
you&#39;re really changing lives and it&#39;s
actually since come full circle when we
found out he&#39;s a computer science major
we said we have internships and he
interviewed and he actually rocked all
the rounds of the interviews and he&#39;s
actually now going to join us this
summer to build the tools for four
frankly the next generation of Charlie&#39;s
so we&#39;re very very excited about that
this is an announcement that came out
only a few weeks ago the the College
Board announced in 2016 they&#39;re going to
have a new SAT but part of that kind of
the first time in history the cause
board recognized that look there is this
inequity at least a perceived inequity
around people having access to test prep
and able to optimize their score and
really put their best foot forward so
this is something they had never done
before extremely exciting for Khan
Academy what we&#39;re going to be doing is
collaborating with them sharing items
really working together vetting content
to make the best test prep available and
this won&#39;t just be your classic test
prep this will not just be how to game
the exam how to guess appropriately test
taking strategies it&#39;s really about
state of the art tools for deep practice
analytics and feedback and I think
working together we are really going to
be able to level this playing field a
little bit the other thing that has
happened since the last TED talk is
we&#39;ve expanded beyond essentially our
world the english-speaking world the the
developed world we started
internationalizing there&#39;s a fully
Spanish Khan Academy there&#39;s a
Portuguese Khan Academy Turkish French
is coming soon all the world&#39;s languages
are our goal and to get a sense of what
this looks like I&#39;ll show you this next
video quite a bit we put in use convene
JC she&#39;s an shuhada I meant to jannat
I&#39;m not in
twisting p-orbital mana goes out then a
kelipah - a bachelor seems was it well
oh ah ah what is that on all today on
our team does it move the sultry squeeze
importance and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s kind
of surreal for me that this you know
this literally was starting to walk in
closet and during the last TED talk we
were only a seven person organization
since then we&#39;re now sixty people we&#39;ve
had thousands of volunteers we have
200,000 teachers using us in a classroom
in some way shape or form
all of these are pictures of Khan
Academy use being used all over the
planet and what I like to think about
its kind of take a step back sometimes
and you know go back 400 years and if
you were to observe say Western Europe
which even then was one of the most
literate parts of the planet you would
have seen about 10 or 15 percent of the
population could read and if you were to
ask say a member of the clergy someone
who could read what percentage of the
population using is even capable
intellectually capable of reading they
might have said maybe 30 or 40 percent
if you had a really really good
education system we now know that that&#39;s
that&#39;s not true it&#39;s wildly pessimistic
the answer is actually closer to 100
percent and so fast-forwarding today I&#39;d
like to think about what similar
blinders do we have on that right now if
you were to ask someone what percentage
of people are capable of novel research
what percentage of people can understand
genetics or computer science or robotics
I think you will get an answer like 5 or
10 or 15 percent but what if that answer
is actually a hundred percent and what&#39;s
exciting about the next 5 10 15 50 years
is I think we&#39;re going to actually be
able to test those bounds and actually
go beyond them where we can take this
thing called education this thing that&#39;s
been scarce is the determinant between
the haves and have-nots and like clean
drinking water and basic shelter turn it
into a fundamental human right thank you
that&#39;s it so hey listen um
so you said you said that right now like
90% of the usage of Khan Academy is is
not in school it&#39;s kind of individual
use if you were to put on your futurist
hat and roll the clock forward I don&#39;t
know it&#39;s a twenty years when all the
good thinking that you&#39;re introducing to
the world and others are it plays out
what does education look like then does
it happen mainly in homes is it still
happen in schools with teachers and
classrooms how does it happen do you
think I think there will always be
classrooms but I think the nature of
them will be much more self-directed
much more interactive it won&#39;t be about
lecture anymore it&#39;ll be about a
community of learners taking ownership
of their learning and frankly using
things like Khan Academy for the core
skills but then building portfolios
things like our computer science
platform writing so that your transcript
isn&#39;t just your scores but it&#39;s also
what you&#39;ve made well you&#39;re doing as
much as anyone in the world to realize
that future all power to you my friend I
can&#39;t kid
