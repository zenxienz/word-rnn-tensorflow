I gave a TED talk a few years ago in
which I didn&#39;t sound the alarm loud
enough that guys are failing they are
failing academically they are failing
socially and they&#39;re flaming out
sexually with women what does it mean
failing academically guys are dropping
out at 30% only 42% of guys are
graduating with the BAS 70% of all DNF
grades are going to guys
the majority of guys are in special ed
programs fine wiping out socially with
girls I&#39;ve been studying shyness for 40
years the level of shyness among boys is
higher than it&#39;s ever been
especially one-on-one with girls why
they don&#39;t know social communication
they have no social skills and so it&#39;s a
new kind of shyness it&#39;s a social
awkwardness it&#39;s like being in a foreign
country and not knowing the language
they don&#39;t know the language of social
communication especially with girls play
me out sexually they are confusing and
preferring porn sex to real sex
why because porn sex is available it&#39;s
free
it&#39;s easy it&#39;s no complications no
emotional no emotional involvement it
also a means that there&#39;s no romance no
love no kissing no touching and it&#39;s no
performance anxiety what are the reasons
for this we think there are five main
factors America is now leading the world
industrialized world in far lawlessness
between 1 into 1 third and 40% of old
boys are now growing up without a father
issues between minority community it&#39;s
out true in all the communities when
Paula&#39;s are present they spend on
average 30 minutes talking with his son
in one-on-one conversation that same kid
spends 44 hours a week in a digital
world so what&#39;s the message there we
want to get secondly is that by me you
got it before whoops go back sorry
so mothers give love unconditionally
they love you because you exist they&#39;re
happy that the son is in a room he&#39;s not
in trouble
father&#39;s give love conditionally you got
to perform what it has all American
children grow up without a father
physically project now the problem is
mothers give love unconditionally I love
you because she might child this is this
for fathers they give their love
condition you got before we got put out
me so coming home with a C or D is
unacceptable you know so you&#39;re not
going to get a lot you&#39;re not going to
drive the car whatever it is guys no one
have that male imperative of if you want
to be loved and inspected by me you got
it before so guys are five times five
times more likely to have attention
deficit disorder many more times likely
to be put on very heavy medication which
affects them in very serious ways if
there was a draft our generals tell us
there are not enough young men who can
meet the most minimal physical standards
so if they think of it as a national
disaster feminization of schools
elementary schools primary schools now
have only one male for every nine
teachers we know boys brains develop
differently more slowly schools are no
longer fit places for boys to made&#39;
overage support online porn the
high-speed Internet has changes
everything
porn is available 24/7 around the world
there are hundreds and hundreds of porn
channels and kids get chat at trapped
when I call a present hedonistic time
zone with no sense of the future and
addiction is not it&#39;s a number of hours
you do something addiction arousal is
you want variety one change to be
addicted to anything means you would
rather be doing that than anything in
the world and when you&#39;re not doing it
that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking about doing
overuse of video games Jane of course
tells us the wonderful things about
video games and I agree when played in
moderation we&#39;re talking about by time
and hard data by the time a boy is
twenty one is paid spent
10,000 hours playing video games that&#39;s
2 bachelor degrees
what&#39;s wrong with playing video games
that much on the average kids boys are
playing 5 to 15 hours a day so what are
they not doing as Tierney says they&#39;re
not connecting with nature 1 they&#39;re not
creating they&#39;re consuming ok secondly
playing these video games mean they have
a distorted view of reality
because they play video games alone so
my problem is only excess in in
isolation in Japan problem is much more
serious in America there&#39;s a whole new
phenomena hundreds-of-thousands called
hikiko mean hikikomori now spend their
entire life in their room they never
leave their room it says up here when
life sucks might as well just stay in
your room and live life there so what&#39;s
the next we have to refined masculinity
men have to step up to the plate they
have to be available they have to make
connection healthy Mentors but for your
own kids and for other kids women have
to help men learn how to collaborate in
creating vibrant families parents have
to regulate digital time they also have
to create more vibrant family table time
have to encourage kids to do social
activity and share this does information
with each other regularly schools have
to be cut higher or more male teachers
no question about it they also have to
change their curriculum most schools are
still the old-fashioned school they have
to mean what interactive testing more
visual and they have to realize that
there are differences in gender learning
styles the health community has to
realize that video addiction and porn
addiction are reality and they have to
have to develop better prevention
techniques and treatment techniques next
alas our government has this has to now
reward welfare system has to reward
fathers for staying in homes right now
the reward father&#39;s for being absent and
reward only solo mothers lastly we need
a new social app for boys that rings
every hour essentially says get your ass
out on the street
okay so check this at checkout book at
the minds of guys that I did with my
colleague Nikita Duncan in it we survey
20,000 people 70 70 % guys and they&#39;re
really amazing interesting stuff there
thanks so much yeah um just very briefly
Phil um I mean if if if your research
you know bears out I mean what are
consequences for things like population
growth or you know for society oh it&#39;s
data say well in Japan there was one of
the picked is a group of young men who
now go online publicly say we have given
up sex we do not want the AG performance
anxiety and Japan has the lowest
population rate in the world and so you
have tens of thousands of young men ages
10 to 30 saying we don&#39;t want sex
anymore I think again if you live a
world in pornography you know it&#39;s all
of the moment there is no procreation
there&#39;s no concern about the future now
the last thing I want to say is there is
lot there&#39;s new research on Netherlands
proving Jane&#39;s point there are many many
multiple benefits of video games but not
when played in excess and not when in
social isolation still isn&#39;t like you
thank you sir okay
