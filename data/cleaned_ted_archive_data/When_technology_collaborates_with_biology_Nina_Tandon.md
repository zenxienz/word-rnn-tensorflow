so we all have a picture like this right
it&#39;s your eighth birthday your smiles as
big as your afro because you just opened
up like the present you always wanted
which was your first chemistry set right
so yeah from a bit of a geeky family
here&#39;s a pic of me with my two sisters
Sheila Meera then there&#39;s me and Neil my
brother and what I look at this picture
I see so many things is a lot for me I
have memories of how we used to play
with science when we were kids
measuring pie with pots and pans but
what I wanted to show this to you for
was because when I look at this picture
and it helps me trace back what&#39;s become
a bit of a professional preoccupation
for me okay see my two gorgeous sisters
Sheila and mirror actually both color
blinds and my brother Neil is have
retinitis pigmentosa so he has very
limited peripheral vision and it&#39;s blind
at night and so this has some real
implications in our family I was the
only normal sighted sibling and it led
to a lot of discussions you know really
important stuff like Sheila those shoes
not match that dress that is eyeshadow
not lipstick you know roadside bingo was
a bit of a challenge and you can imagine
that was just the tip of the iceberg it
was my introduction to an idea that I
think is quite powerful this idea that
biology as you know miraculous as it is
sustaining our bodies creating our
experience of life it&#39;s also responsible
for the way that we experience it it was
miraculous and fallible it was my
introduction to biology as a technology
I followed this preoccupation through
engineering this is a theremin it&#39;s a
musical instrument does anyone know it
yeah awesome where you play it by waving
your hands in front of antenna and you
interfere with them with an oscillating
circuit and you make music this is me
giving my senior thesis presentation in
college on
with motion tracking and can we meet the
video please thank you
and eventually I landed in a field
called tissue engineering a field where
we use technology and button cells to be
able to grow living spare parts for the
human body and this is a video of some
beating heart tissue that I engineered
during my PhD and I&#39;m now working on a
start-up called epi bones where we apply
these same principles to developing
living human personalized bone grafts we
hope these living bone grafts can
someday revolutionize the world of
skeletal reconstruction and I&#39;ve often
viewed my work at being part of this
evolving story of how we view the body
this idea of body 1.0 up until only
about a hundred years ago where
basically we left the body alone and
hoped for the best
towards about a hundred years ago where
we started viewing the body as an
assembly of spare parts so if you need
it you know analogous to the the
Industrial Revolution and we started
thinking about assembly lines and if you
needed a spare part for the human body
you might get it from a donor or you
might make a new heart right but the
paradigm was still the same this idea of
viewing the body as spare parts right
but we&#39;re moving forward towards this
future where we can really think of self
as other bodies as renewable resource of
cells that we can use to regenerate new
parts for the human body right and this
is so cool this idea is so cool to me
and I love participating in the story
but what I wanted to share with you
today is that I think that this is
really just one part of the story a
broader story in that this is an
evolution in thinking that applies not
just to our own bodies but how we view
technology itself what I want to tell
you about is how I believe that we&#39;re
witnessing an emergence of a
technological revolution that is more
efficient and more natural I want to
tell you that the time of lip building
with living cells has arrived and I
believe that these results were not only
going to change the way we live but how
we view life itself imagine a world
where energy is converted at a rate
10,000 times more
gently than the Sun where batteries are
alive and we&#39;re broken bridges breakdown
and repair themselves every day ladies
and gentlemen we already live in that
world can we go back one slide please
our mitochondria and every cell of our
body gram for gram produce energy 10,000
times more efficiently than the Sun
every single cell in our bodies has a
voltage across its cell membrane and
every bone in our body is broken down
and repaired every day this is amazing
and we&#39;re already living with this
technology and right now we&#39;re at the
middle of a beautiful collision of a
couple technologies a digital
fabrication evolves towards allowing us
to pattern living cells okay in 3d
patterns and as synthetic biology is
coming online where we&#39;re beginning to
think of genetic circuits as Legos that
we can rearrange and build as we like we
can imagine a not-too-distant future
where we can design and fabricate
rationally designed living systems okay
this is not biomimicry
copying nature this is collaborating
with biology and so it behooves us to
ask the question a paradigm shifting
question what can we do with self and in
my own field of tissue engineering this
has taken the form of a dazzling array
of examples Toni attalos work with
flatters engineering an optical cup in
Japan lungs and kidneys at Harald ops
lab at Harvard vasculature at Lauren
Nicholson&#39;s lab and then her company&#39;s
human sight and even cancer in the case
of Karen Berg lab at Clemson University
but as I&#39;ve been discovering more and
more I have friends in some of the
oddest of places this is Suzanne Lee the
good friends she&#39;s a fashion designer
based in London who uses a kombucha like
slurry of bacteria and yeast sugar and
water to grow vegetable leather and this
leather can be used to grow everything
from shoes to jackets and meet Mitch
j√°chym he&#39;s an architecture professor
in New York City
who asks why not grow a home and
experiments with growing lattices that
may someday serve as living wall and
meat andres borghi he&#39;s the CEO of
modern meadow which is a company using
bio fabrication techniques not not far
from what I use to grow hearts tissue
towards growing meat and leather asking
why grow fields of corn to feed the
animals that we use for mutant leather
if we can just grow the cells into those
materials directly enemy caiman Palin
he&#39;s a bio mineralogist
that&#39;s a mouthful who collaborates with
bacteria to mine valuable minerals from
desalination brine which is the toxic
byproducts from desalination seawater
he&#39;s creating he&#39;s using these bacteria
to create wealth from waste while
protecting the environment and meat in
Mar Riedel Cruz he&#39;s a bioengineering
professor at Stanford University it has
got a pretty odd example he&#39;s making
video games using microbes as living
pixels okay and the electrical signals
that he uses to guide these paramecia
around this is a clip from his one of
his video games where the paramecia are
making the ball bounce around to get rid
of the blocks okay so cool and at the
other end of the spectrum literally the
product life cycle meet Jay Renly she&#39;s
an artist who developed a strain of
mushroom that she calls the Infinity
mushroom that can be used as an active
element in a kind of living coffin that
helps to remediate the waste released
into the environment as part of the
decomposition process after death it
almost begs the question what can&#39;t be
done but it also raises some important
other questions like would these kinds
of technologies what would that mean for
us as a society if those technologies
became mainstream and I love this quote
the role of the artist is to ask
questions not answer them and so thank
goodness there are bio artists in the
mix using their biological skills to
grow
art that can help to contribute to the
discussion meet Murray bar shy
she&#39;s a bio artist and founder of a
space called gem space it&#39;s the
country&#39;s first biohacking lab which is
basically that gym membership model for
for biology pay 100 bucks a month and
you can do your experiments and take
classes and explore questions that you
might not be able to explore in an
academic lab what Nurit likes to say is
she likes to look at not look for and in
one of her projects to use exploring how
bacteria which are surprisingly social
and collaborative how they respond to
the various topography is imposed on
them on their landscapes by using
various frequencies of sound and she has
many beautiful results which she says
are the results of looking at not
looking for and a beautiful lens also
for us to explore the role of topography
in our own rhythms in our own lives in
the way that we collaborate and
socialize with each other as humans meet
you not nor and Oren cast their
husband-and-wife team and former Harvard
Medical School research fellows who
started a bio lab called spin biotic ax
in Australia for the express purpose of
growing art they ask the Queen oh when
people say hey you bet you&#39;ve heard this
phrase when pigs fly is this to say
that&#39;ll never happen they ask the
question what would pig wings look like
and so they grew them they they also
grow them in green and blue and they
made a so-called victimless leather
jacket that was displayed at the New
York City Museum of Modern Art do we
sense a jacket theme here and I like
this product is violent from a show
created by some bot Bayaka called
portraits painted with genetically
glowing bacteria can you see in the
petri dish it&#39;s it&#39;s a face to support
hrus and it&#39;s a it&#39;s drawn by bacteria
that are glowing but they&#39;re also
spliced with genes that have been
implicated in Alzheimer&#39;s disease okay
so as these portraits fade they evoke
the idea of lost memory I hope that I&#39;m
convincing is that by learning to speak
the language of cells that we can
hoax them into doing so much saving
lives conserving the planet inspiring
unprecedented works of art and above all
continuing to command our wonder so
what&#39;s next
I think the limits really are just our
imagination
I can imagine living looms based on
ingmar&#39;s videogames that weave fabrics
based on Suzanne&#39;s microbes can imagine
t-bone steaks that epi bone helps grow
as modern meadow but there are many
interesting questions that must be
addressed
are we playing God is tinkering with the
cellular material of viruses bacteria
and plants and animals equals and should
there be different bars for tinkering
with various life-forms for the sake of
research versus education versus
entertainment and if there are more
bacterial cells in our body than human
cells and if we can grow human cells in
the lab what does it even mean to be
human looking back a lot of these
questions echo those with past
disruptive technologies things like the
insta telegraph which we can trace to
the Victorian Internet we call the
Victorian Internet and it wasn&#39;t so long
ago that people were afraid of the risk
of transmitting their own Souls through
blood donation and we go through it and
to help with accelerating this
familiarity and fluency with these kinds
of technologies I think places like
Jen&#39;s Bates are going to play a really
pivotal role elevating the scientific
literacy of our population in the
bioethics discourse so meet Stephen
ELISA and Erin they were students that I
was lucky enough to help mentor at done
space their architecture students
exploring the idea of dynamic media
content by learning to print living
cells and tattoos on these living cells
and watching them as they evolve okay
you can imagine what the bioethics
discussions were at night after they
actually learned to grow these cells
with their own hands my theory is
basically that once you see DNA and feel
it with your own hands then crime scene
shows and bioethics discussions are
really never the same that&#39;s strawberry
DNA by the way
and I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed your tour of
the various ways that diverse people are
exploring collaborating with living
systems treating them as living building
blocks like this gorgeous Drosophila
embryo and since we&#39;re really at the
beginning here and speaking of Legos and
because I started with an awkward
picture of myself thought I&#39;d show you a
better looking picture this is my niece
Sonya playing with her first choo-choo
train made out of Legos and I wanted to
show that to you
I share my final thought if the first
Industrial Revolution was about machines
and the second about information as we
think ahead to the world that we&#39;re
preparing for her and the world that her
generation will prepare for us aren&#39;t we
excited at the prospect that the third
Industrial Revolution can be about life
thank you
[Applause]
