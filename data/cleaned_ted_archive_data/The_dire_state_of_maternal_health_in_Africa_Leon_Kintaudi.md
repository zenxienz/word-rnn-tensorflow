after listening to earnest and those who
proceed and being the last Britain speak
before you go eat your breath kinda
flies out of you you stop reading for a
second there is some great stories and
thank you your nest for the heard dr
congo yes the name is c and you have so
many seeds in that country copper cobalt
gold but this is the carrot of gold
carats of diamonds you name it the
Caesar there coffee and the symptom are
wonders the last word could be curse
that&#39;s possible maybe I was born in
Congo and my father was from an average
family he was the chief of first station
radio station so we had something to to
put the note on sir here and there but
he died suddenly when I was the iSchool
and everything changed from that time I
finished my high school with my forces
behind me having almost nothing
afterwards my other brothers at the
University looking for me I went to the
stake the ticket was paid by one of my
uncles in state I decide the medicine
because I was very frustrated as a lost
my father because he had an acute
appendicitis
and it was unthinkable how could I lose
my father that way I became a tradition
happily married with another physician
and a beautiful child start going back
home on vacations unfortunately and
sadly I lost five siblings three with
HIV one in accident
and one had cancer and I said do I have
to be in the unit it makes sense so I
decide to go back home but I wanted to
show what the Congo is compared to the
u.s. if you take Alaska in Hawaii Congo
about 1/4 of the size of the United
States and those dotted line that you&#39;re
seeing there are the paved roads of
Congo beside the cities my first return
there the first few months are ran like
a dog I couldn&#39;t deal with it
I went back a year later the same thing
I ran the third time I ran and the
fourth time I said I&#39;ll stay
unfortunately there&#39;s a time when we
have all these lootings and everybody&#39;s
trying to get rid of Mobutu all the
killing the took place estate estate and
lost virtually everything I had brought
back from the state but this is not my
story what hurts me the most is that we
talked about malaria we talked about HIV
we talked about acute respiratory
infections we talked about potential and
sadly that something&#39;s happening in
Africa that we are overseeing the death
of women who are bringing joy to this
world heavy babies no one is saying much
about that you turn around most of us
are saying well we have to do something
about HIV but before I&#39;m going to detail
let me just show you
information about the era Congo I think
my friend Katja said that we have six
million people roughly in the country
the crisis you name them will have
millions of them there the wars we have
16 since 1960 and 4 million to $5 the
last one that we just had
the tribes about 400 and women have an
average 7 kids problems with the 7
methods if 0.4 and literacy among the
women is about 44 which is unthinkable
in the US what are the challenges with
all these in your head maternal death a
huge 112 89 per hundred thousand live
births if you have to put all these
women if you calculate quickly the
number of women who can give birth in a
country roughly you have something
between 18 and 24 thousand women dying
every year if you have to pack them in a
jumbo jet you&#39;ll have something like
forty to sixty Jamaa jet crashing every
year in that country children between 0
&amp; 5 we have 2013 out of 1000 die every
year this is a situation in Africa as
you can see Congo Angola Ethiopia a
little bit in your graphing Mozambique
here you have over 1000 and above of
women who the number children dull
because they came to this earth and you
can see the local part of Africa and
deliver South Africa Iran Nigeria we
have less death than in Congo certainly
we are asked physician sometimes
overlooked this but working in a project
that was funded by US aid is made me
think what is the role of an African a
Kamali&#39;s woman in that society and this
would have found out model for many
seven
that&#39;s when his role has arrived in
provider with what sometime I wonder
worker producer in the financial person
these ladies I met them not long ago
they woke up at 4 in the morning they
woke up at 4 in the morning
they walked 27 kilometers to go pick up
what they have on top of their head if
cassava wet ones roughly a sack of
cement on top of the head and they will
go back home to fix some shaquan with
something like our for fou and then sell
it and ask them the whole thing they had
on top of the head was worth $27 it
three of them and this woman at the end
has cooked for the husband and be
pregnant and have a baby these are all
the women and usually in Congo I don&#39;t
know about other countries but the woman
is only the second ranked person these
are old women a dead age they still go
into the field to bring something back
home while the guys are fitting and
enjoyed himself some time he had a
couple of beers or local wine or local
beers major maternal health issues
hemorrhage in those places in the health
centers where we are
malaria during pregnancy you&#39;ve seen
that most of them to die because they
become anemic HIV and TB sexual
transmitted diseases malnutrition as
another issue is an example what
happened to a child born by those notice
I&#39;m fine in a hospital working kkf
padishah what happens on underweight are
nourish any illness the child is gone
we are the savage flow program that was
funded by USAID us eight and we did a
few things to try to improve these
conditions with accidental our children
curative care this is some of the
physicians we trained the nurses we
trained so they could take care of our
mothers giving birth prenatal care in
most places
well shall care is something we did with
you said support and we distribute
treated bed nets
to all the women who came for prenatal
care to try to fight malaria as much of
liquid blood safety was something else
we did also we distribute drugs
throughout the country we have a hundred
help zone d&#39;arco heads by three hundred
we just created seven more are three
hundred more so we have five we&#39;ll do
something else on in a country you can
imagine what is undone out there
we gave water in teach people sanitation
which way in hell themes on-site where
we were and these are the few results we
did improve actually the vaccination of
from--for is something to nanny
something percent obstacles and
difficulties that we face while doing
that these are the guys who tend to kill
our villages nothing happening without
them if you have to go to hospital he
has to see you first to give you
something to protect you against what&#39;s
going to happen there or when terrain
say he can dance and they&#39;ll stop the
rain you can think of all the things you
can think of these are some of the guys
who are miracle guys I&#39;ll call them but
this the guys are obstacles to our
societies they create attitudes that we
have hard time dealing with
accessibility the roads truck stuck in
the middle of nowhere
few examples communication
I must anchor Conte because we thought
he assist them with water phone I don&#39;t
know what would have done but this
happens the person is sick
has be transported from one place to
another he dies in the middle quality
care is initial and I think my brother
was screening here we need to give
quality care I said unfortunately for
Congo most efficient are going to South
Africa to Europe to the United States
because they&#39;re earning less as Chris
said so we are training nurses to do the
job of physicians poverty is a problem
how do you solve this would we go from
here poverty here we have the mother a
child a father trying to fix road for $1
each for the day
did you see another problem this kids
actually not reading they look at
pictures of public health book that we
had they can&#39;t read instead of the
health care these mother just had a baby
few weeks ago and I was there
same here two children want a baby
another only babies there beside the
woman with family planning premature
motherhood 15 years old this is a place
where our kids come out to see the world
is actually a delivery room that&#39;s
unthinkable in u.s. when I was working
there and what&#39;s needed this is the
confusion because if we have to sit down
in office to discuss this we take days
and have sessions and nothing comes out
afterwards because the reality fell so
well what is my vision involvement of
all the best all of us that we&#39;ve also
to our kids our mothers don&#39;t die with
something that is joy that should bring
happiness to everybody all of us have to
BL what can we do here I want to make
sure to the African man to treat our
women with dignity there&#39;s something we
don&#39;t do
[Applause]
we are the same we cannot be outside
into three-in-one and come back home and
try to have sex with her she&#39;s a thing
that&#39;s what right from were close at
protect women in our countries we cannot
be having second bureaus not we did with
Mobutu third bureaus a woman became an
office that&#39;s illegal we should be doing
that educate our children specially our
daughters so they can become women who
can stand up and be themselves and be
productive we&#39;ve got to teach our
children our women our kids especially
they&#39;re our daughters I&#39;m not saying we
should abandon the boys the girls need
to be taught so they don&#39;t become women
with 150 kilos on the head walking
earning twenty dollars that&#39;s abnormal
have work trained personnel it&#39;s crucial
so we can stop hemorrhage of those women
when they come in so we can take care of
them before they have the babies
properly instead of having nurses who
have nothing to do with them and watch
them die so it&#39;s important training we
need to train our health care personnel
and the equipment as you can see how can
you click over someone in the condition
ago making sense we need infrastructure
and equipment so that those women did
not die bringing a child to life and
finally our leaders in a government exam
a lot have been said about them and he
said that these leaders are incapable of
seeing what we are saying but when you
don&#39;t have love it&#39;s hard to love
another person when you don&#39;t have
compassion it&#39;s hard to look at your a
person our ladies need to change I will
really need to understand our leaders
need to see in Africanism
different with chelina strong with a
woman a strong thank you very much
[Applause]
especially when I Lian when I came
across your work I think one of the
pieces I read was in Time magazine and
one of the things that struck me was the
fact that you were focusing on the rule
if info infrastructure the rebuilding of
the rural infrastructure in the Congo
how do you see what you started as
continuing how do you see it as being
becoming sustainable
what sort of inputs would you need to
sort of build upon what you&#39;ve done so
far
Amica to be frank with you sometime I
get very frustrated and you could
discourage to to see that our leaders
don&#39;t lift and yet as you saw you trying
to take medicine somewhere and just talk
for weeks and sometimes a drug saw
deteriorate you can&#39;t do anything with
the fact things are going bad and mostly
family talk to these leaders there were
first interest is there what goes into
the pocket the Detroits it hurts I think
sustainability is a very big issue
I&#39;m thankful the US idea continued to
assist us for the next three years again
what we did is to develop some parallel
activities beside the healthcare for
these people when you earn a dollar day
when we have a country words uses fees
for your healthcare obviously you&#39;re
going to have people are going to stay
outside the healthcare system and you&#39;ll
take care but they&#39;re kicking themselves
or into some witch doctor or something
no oh what would it take to persuade
other Congolese doctors I mean there&#39;s
the several hundred thousands of
Congolese doctors have been trained and
are basically working in the US or
Britain or Europe you&#39;ve come back
because of your own vision maybe others
wouldn&#39;t do that what can you imagine a
program that would bring more people
like you back I started
is a program which we are training
family physician those family fidget
wait twenty nine right now we are
working with the fat Africans Medical
University of South Africa and Medusa
with a training station for four years
to be family physician and what I&#39;ve
tried to show this guy that is possible
to leave home is possible to make money
at home they can have groups not wait to
go look for a job but to come up with
group they can provide quality care show
some compassion you have something that
one physician to 50 to 100 thousand so
if you can put a group of physician
together giving quality care because we
don&#39;t want to have a politically I mean
you have to pay a million dollars to be
treated so it is possible if you
together as a team
reduce the cost of medical care to these
people you will make enough money to
survive I&#39;ve succeeded with six of them
the back home running play cross
producing Kiba say which have because
the vendor mekomo province I&#39;ve some of
them in Kerala which is a ignore and
some just graduated in the clinic fix of
me did you start to go back with me so
I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ll succeed during
everything that is something I would
like to try but they are not sure the
entire audience which is your vision the
great success going forward thank you so
much
