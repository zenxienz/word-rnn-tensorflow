hello there I&#39;m a cultural historian and
as my level of concern with the future
of cities has grown I&#39;m writing less
books and writing more manifestos and
this is one of them contrary to the
feverish promises of turn of the 20th
century
futurists the romance of the road is
it&#39;s driving Humanity down a dead-end
the era of speed acceleration motorized
mobility is transforming the world into
a perpetual traffic jam entire cities
are being sacrificed on the altar of
Auto mobility the landscape is being
reduced to a drive-through and flyover
zone racks to extract fuels whose
combustion is quite literally cooking
globe and nearly 70 percent of major
metropolitan areas today are regularly
under dense and noxious blankets of smog
and people aren&#39;t moving more they&#39;re
moving less and with greater difficulty
and of course they&#39;re also having to
manage the health consequences of the
sedentary lifestyles that they&#39;ve been
encouraged to adopt so if this is the
much celebrated era of mobility I think
it&#39;s time for us to switch gears from
mobility to what I&#39;m going to call
movability movability takes place it
unfolds on the far more intimate
intelligent human scale of the emerging
21st century cityscape it&#39;s the scale of
autonomous land run starting their way
down sidewalks on crowded sidewalks the
scale of cargo vehicles invisibly
tethered to human operators performing
last mile deliveries in pedestrian-only
zones it&#39;s the scale of electric micro
cars platooning down streets while being
able to carry out individualized pickups
and drop-offs and it&#39;s the scale of
civic spaces animated by new kinds of
vehicles that improve the life of the
mobility impaired of the aging
population by extending the compass and
the range of their activities
now I&#39;d like to introduce you to a
vehicle that embodies the spirit of
movability so you can have to sit tight
for a second while I go fix this vehicle
so meet jitta I&#39;m going to take data for
a little walk while we sew cheetah my
robotic sidekick here is the first in a
family of vehicles currently undergoing
advanced testing and development at
piaggio fast forward in Boston and as
you can see cheetah is the kind of motor
scooter for the 21st century it&#39;s a
category of vehicles that I think is
really going to explode over the course
of the next decade and transform the way
we move around cities and like its Big
Brother kilo cheetah is a functional and
fun cargo vehicle that allows people to
move more to move better to move further
and faster to move both more pleasurably
and more efficiently
whether you&#39;re a neighborhood resident
who needs to move three or four bags of
groceries down the block or you&#39;re an
office worker who likes to run back and
forth to work Lexx jog or you&#39;re a
utility worker a maintenance worker who
needs to have their hands-free so they
can perform useful labor while they&#39;re
trailed by an intelligent toolbox let&#39;s
say in a kind of campus type environment
cheetah is your move ability helper
allowing you to do things that you used
to have to do by driving now you can do
them while walking and perhaps best of
all once you&#39;ve completed your appointed
rounds
you can send jito off on its own either
back to base or out on an autonomous
mission into the world now
d-does cargo bay is is built we&#39;re going
to skip through your scooters cargo bay
is built to the scale designed to the
scale of a basically a case of one we
loaded this one up with flowers and
produce but at 40 pounds approximately
in 2000 cubic inches that&#39;s a move
ability challenge that would lead most
of us to read
for the keys to the car to drive Tita
I think as you&#39;ve already seen is
basically to walk if you know how to
walk you know how to drive a vehicle
like this you don&#39;t need to open up an
instruction manual and with its bicycle
sides wheels it can easily and
comfortably to reverse everything from
you know regular and irregular pavement
surfaces it can move between indoor and
outdoor environment streets sidewalks
and so forth and up and down ad a
compliant ramps okay
cheetah has three operational modes the
mode I&#39;ve been showing you which I&#39;m
about to activate again follow me
autonomous and convoy or daisy chain and
you&#39;re not as follow me I&#39;m not using
this device to get Gina to follow me
here it&#39;s using lidar it&#39;s it&#39;s mapping
onto the movement of my of my feet but
what&#39;s perhaps most distinctive about
cheetah the most meaningful about it is
that it leverages the superior power of
human intelligence to perform complex
navigational tasks sidewalks streets
pedestrian areas of all kinds civic
spaces are devilishly complex
environments they come complete with
cracks in the pavement with obstacles
like lampposts and fire hydrants and so
forth
and of course they&#39;re animated by other
moving agents whether it&#39;s pedestrians
or pets or the like given that the world
is not about to be redesigned for
purposes of machine vision and thank God
for that that would be a pretty dreary
rectilinear dystopia jito learns the
optimal pathways through the world by
following an expert guide namely you or
me in this particular case as it travels
it creates detailed three-dimensional
maps of everything encountered it
encounters so that when it&#39;s sent off on
autonomous missions between designated
waypoints it can move intelligently but
adapt should the real world have
diverged from its existing knowledge
base
machine intelligence walking
hand-in-hand with human intelligence
the phrase is a phrase that appeals to
me because it gestures towards a future
in which the equation between movement
and life that has been embraced by every
human civilization over the course of
millennia could now found its mind
itself translated into a bold new
formula a bold new equation namely that
new and enhanced forms of individual
movement equal a better quality of life
for society as a whole thank you
[Applause]
