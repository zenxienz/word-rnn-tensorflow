two people with green wristbands please
go back to where you came from thank you
thank you after the doc not right now so
there&#39;s some things that I have always
struggled with most of my adult life and
and that is my inability to deal with
 it&#39;s just that this so much of
it it&#39;s it&#39;s everywhere but i think i
may have finally found a way to deal
with it a few years ago when the u.s.
midterm election cycle was in full swing
i was consuming news at a very unhealthy
level now this was a time when arizona
my home state had just passed a law
called SB 1070 this was a law that
allows God&#39;s to pull you over and ask
you for your papers just because you
were Brown and the lawmakers claimed
that it had nothing to do with rape
and that it would help make it as an ass
if ur but what they were really thing
was racial profiling we don&#39;t do that
here now let&#39;s go get that Brown asshole
and and this was a time where this kind
of was coming in from offsides
and I was just not sure what to do and
to space saying I I felt I had to do
something and and so I began to make art
in response to all of the things that
are upsetting me all of the things that
I thought were I I looked at
all of this incoming and I
began to respond with of my own
I was frustrated with the Republicans
and
I was also frustrated with the Democrats
and that&#39;s a real Democrat and I did a
whole series of these posters and and
they were part of a larger exhibit
called a bunch of crock now a bunch of
truck was all about me it was a way for
me to feel better about trying to make a
home in Arizona I wanted to bring James
here but his application was rejected
but a bunch of crock was also my Howard
Beale moment it was it was an
opportunity for me to yell things as
obnoxious as this attention people with
pink wristbands global warming is a myth
and so is poverty and racism god bless
Glenn Beck amen thank you hey man and
the bsa&#39;s in the wristbands that you&#39;re
wearing were also part of the exhibit
and and when the exhibit opened and and
then when i began to post the stuff
online
and when i began to post the stuff
online something strange began to happen
what was mostly meant as catharsis from
me began to do actually resonate with
random strangers other than the
occasional you are a moron comment which
I enjoy most of the feedback that I
received made it very clear that there
are a whole lot of other people out
there also in need of this kind of
catharsis and so now I want to take this
idea a step further a bunch of crock was
about all of the things that I thought
were but now i want to make art
about things that other people think are
 and and recently in recently
I&#39;ve started taking other stories of
 and transforming them into
posters animations videos or if audio
stories and more and as i work on these
projects what i have learned and what I
continue to learn is that life can be
difficult it can be full of challenges
it can be messy it can be full of
 but sometimes a little bit of
creativity a little bit of humor can
help you get through that&#39;s what my art
does for me and that&#39;s what I hope it
can do for others as well thank
