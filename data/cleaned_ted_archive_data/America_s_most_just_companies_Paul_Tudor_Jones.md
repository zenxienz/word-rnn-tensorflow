last year I spoke about ten minutes here
now most had
eighteen minutes so they invited me back
this year because I had extra credit
last year I talked about the crisis
facing capitalism and income inequality
you knew I was serious because I brought
charts this year I brought even more
charts you see there&#39;s been a
narrow-minded focus on corporate
profitability has come at the expense of
employees and communities it has created
an unprecedented wealth gap in the
country today
between the rich and the poor and it&#39;s
made our citizenry angry as divided in
our country the stock market recently
has done a pretty good job of rectifying
this by pushing the helm from the top
but obviously a better way is to elevate
and to lift up from the bottom the best
way to do that is by refocusing
capitalism around the concept of justice
where socially responsible corporate
activity becomes just as important to
companies as does making money so with
that idea in mind we created a couple of
years ago a not-for-profit enterprise
called just capital and we began working
on the just index and this is a list of
companies American ones to begin with
where we&#39;re going to rank them according
to their justness now the response has
been broad-based enthusiastic and
business leaders in particular are
asking what can I do to make my company
more just and why do they want to know
because customers want it their
employees will demand it and ultimately
they&#39;re their shareholders of profit
from it so to define justice we
undertook one of the most innovative
polls of 43,000 Americans they perfectly
demographically representative sample
and we asked them
what does it mean to be just for a
company to be just and here&#39;s what they
told us the first and most important
factor and whether a company&#39;s just or
not is does it pay its workers fairly
does it provide them in particular a
living wage just like an election
pocketbook issues tend to dominate but
just as important as Fair Pay was so to
was how does a company make its workers
feel does it care about their job
satisfaction does it treat them as
individuals with respect does it promote
fair hiring practices and treatment now
eight other factors that came out time
and time again we heard it over and over
and over where first do they make safe
and reliable products do they protect
employee rights are they well governed
and generated profit do they minimize
their environmental impact
do they make safe and reliable products
that have value and satisfy customers do
they play a positive role in community
do they behave ethically and honestly
and do they create jobs
domestically now we&#39;re polling as we
speak we&#39;re gonna update those
preferences in this summer for the first
time as we will every summer going
forward we&#39;re going to take those
preferences and we&#39;re going to Iraq
America&#39;s 1000 largest companies from
one to a thousand according to those
metrics according to the public&#39;s
definition of justice and this September
will publish those findings and will
highlight the 100 most just company
according to those metrics and call for
just one hundred and we&#39;ll also identify
the number one company in each of 32
major industry sectors and we&#39;ll call
them America&#39;s most just in any company
that&#39;s on either of those lists but just
100 or
America&#39;s most just well those companies
will be able to fix this logo the just
100 America&#39;s just America&#39;s most just
on their products think of that as a
badge of goodness employees will look at
that as an emblem they want to where
shareholders will look at it as a
signpost and they&#39;ll emit a clarion call
to consumers that this is one of the
most just companies in the whole
corporate universe now if just a few of
us just a few of us begin to alter our
behavior while the results if just a few
of us begin to think about what we buy
where we invest where we work well again
the results could be ginormous and I say
that because our individual choices can
have huge collective power the corporate
sector excuse me the private sectors
fifteen trillion dollars if we move just
1% of corporate spending 1% of consumer
spending 1% of Investor holdings that
will have a six hundred billion dollar
annual impact towards companies that are
doing more good this is a 1% that anyone
can join and it&#39;s not defined by how
much money you amass is defined by the
benevolence of your actions thank you
second while while they prepare the
performance on the carpet let&#39;s move
over the other because I think everybody
has a question and it is you don&#39;t have
an index yet but you have criterion
factors and you&#39;ve been thinking about
this for a couple of years how has this
already influenced your investments if
it has well I think the most interesting
anecdote is about a year ago the
co-chair of my company said you know if
you&#39;re going to be out front on this
concept of corporate justice we better
look at our own company we&#39;re a private
company 500 employees so we start with a
number one factor how do we pay our
employees and we&#39;re in financial money
management company so our lowest
employee in Greenwich Connecticut was
making $55,000 and so I thought this is
fantastic we&#39;re made in the shade and
then I thought you know one of our one
of the guys that does our lawns name is
his name is Pablo and I&#39;ve known the guy
for seven years I seem out there all the
time
I said duh there&#39;s no way he&#39;s making
$55,000 and the reality is is that our
company
outsources the facilities as well as the
lawn management our company and in
Greenwich Connecticut he was making
$10.50 an hour and boy when we saw that
I just thought oh my I mean it was it
was literally one of the most it was it
was a bad moment because that&#39;s not a
living wage and we could clearly have
the capability in fact we had 16
employees who were in various parts of
our facilities because we had outsourced
that that we&#39;re getting less than the
minimum wage and I think you know one
thing that we heard in our polling
supply chain issues are really important
to Americans and we&#39;re for that matter
to everyone so I think the supply chain
issues for American companies are going
to be are going to show up in the ragas
here about 94 percent of jobs attached
to corporate America I&#39;m actually not
jobs in the companies they are in supply
chain and and I was going to say
particularly supply chains offshore or
take advantage of very cheap labor
sometimes
as we know child labor etc those are
going to be issues and they&#39;re gonna
factor into that ranking and I think
it&#39;ll be good to bring transparency so
again shareholders consumers employees
know exactly what type of behavior that
company has looking for to the index
thank you
