hi everybody konnichiwa and so you
people out there in Palm Springs you&#39;re
awesome and the picture that you will
see behind me there is from yesterday we
had a great time out there you know I
can actually feel you right now I can
feel the energy from you and I think
that&#39;s an amazing thing and a wonderful
thing that people can do this when they
get together and I also think think that
there is a very deep and profound truth
in this that when people come together
things happen and one of the most
important things that happens this way
is that when we try to make sense of the
world around us it&#39;s not just something
that we do on our own really in fact I
think we are pretty poor at making sense
of the world on our own you&#39;re much
better at doing that together and I call
this a loop by the way so the process of
making the sense of the world is not
really a linear thing from the mind to
the world from the world to the mind but
it goes through other people all the
time
part of that is socially constructed by
the people that were here before us you
could say but equally important it&#39;s
also socially negotiated right here
right now as we meet other people and we
understand what&#39;s going on in the faces
and in the eyes of those around us my
journey to a deep understanding of this
began some years ago on a very dark
November nights when the police came
calling to my door late and informed me
that there&#39;s been an accident involving
my father and my mother they were in the
back seat of a car on the way home from
a party I imagined them happy holding
hands and they met with a very very
large truck and as I talked to the
officers and drove across the country
across the country to talk with a
hospital staff and formally identify
both of them I knew what was going on
but it didn&#39;t make any sense and there
was no point that came later in the days
and the weeks and the months after when
I was talking to friends families and
neighbors and through their eyes and
their faces and their reactions I
understood what was going on you know
what I&#39;m saying
yeah so I have this Android copy of
myself this robot thing and people often
ask me why do you want to do that what
do you want to make this robot copy of
yourself you see the pictures behind me
is part of the production process of
that it&#39;s not always pretty but it is
honest and it&#39;s also some stuff that
we&#39;ve been doing with him over the last
year the obvious answer to the question
is lack of impulse control but there is
also a deep profound question answer I
think that I want to share with you
today and that is I want to put an
Android in that loop because that helps
me understand what&#39;s going on in the
world around me and I thought it would
be nice to have him here on stage to
share this moment with me and with you
so here he is please welcome the
Geminoid DK
robot was built in Japan it&#39;s in the
line of robots that we call Jemma
Lloyd&#39;s Geminoid twin robots and DK is
short for Denmark where we both live
good morning DK how are you thank you
I&#39;m fine but I am still a little stiff
from lying in the crate and the flight
over here yeah and the customs right
that will pass yeah I should hope so
so DK what&#39;s it like to be the Android
in the loop well sometimes people don&#39;t
even realize I&#39;m an Android they think
I&#39;m a human being and they treat me
accordingly do you remember the
demonstration in Copenhagen yeah the one
where several people would walk into the
room say hi to you say hi to me and then
leave again
while asking for directions to the robot
yeah that was crazy
and then there was this other time I
remember a little boy asking his father
dad are they both robots that was Mason
too in that case you were perceived as a
robot how does that make you feel yeah
that is a little unsettling but we&#39;re
getting used to it so DK what can we
learn from your interactions with people
you can learn many things I would think
I&#39;d like to mention three okay in the
first place we have learned that if the
context is real and working then people
are very tolerant towards Android
partners we can build trust between us
now we can also predict with some
certainty at least in which cases people
are likely to react strongly both
positively and negatively that sounds
cool what else in the second place we&#39;re
beginning to learn how H effects the
interaction between human and robot
mm-hmm especially with young children
there are some concerns about the very
realistic androids right but I think we
can begin to design our way around some
of those issues okay anything else right
in the third place we&#39;re beginning to
understand that there are also some
gender differences
and the perception of androids
indications are that women are more
sensitive toward short comings in my
design than men and that it is perhaps
easier for men to accept Android
partners for communication makes sense
but of course that may also have to do
with the fact that I am male yeah okay
and as usual all of these findings do
require further studies now we&#39;re
scientists
right so that&#39;s how it goes well thank
you you&#39;re most welcome
you can say no if I can be of further
assistance I will you can take a little
rest now
so in our culture there is a deep urge
to correct and perfect things and in our
technological time but we tend to do is
replace stuff that hurts or is
potentially hurtful with technology and
there is a lot of good in that but over
the last year a couple of years I&#39;ve
come to think that I think we&#39;re also in
danger of doing something really really
bad if we do this there is an ancient
word describing what happens when you
take away all the things that can happen
in a negative way to you and leave you
with actually nothing and that word is
nirvana in this case it would be Robo
near vana if we replace ourselves in
this kind of sense with robotic machines
now for me at least this can never be
about replacing the human being this can
be about embracing the wonderful
technologies of our time to gain a
deeper and fuller understanding of the
full spectrum or what it means to be a
human being and the reason for this is
actually that it&#39;s not only the good
things in life that makes us connect and
make us understand each other it&#39;s also
the hardship and those bad experiences
that we have which are traces of life
that&#39;s been lived those experience
experiences enables us to connect many
of you have probably also felt this mind
splitting experience of being in love
with someone who does not reciprocate
the feeling mm-hmm yeah or the wonderful
thing about resting in the arms of
someone you love
here in my hands I have scars have one
right here this is a scar from a meeting
with the surprisingly sharp knife in the
school kitchen many years ago when I
damn near cut my finger in half now the
DK has the same scar in his hand it&#39;s
right here but only I have the memory of
it and only I had the memory of the
healing process which took some time and
was a little bit painful and those kinds
of things adds up to the stuff that&#39;s
really important to us today this scar
goes with the collection of other scars
on my body which are emblematic of the
life that I lived and the choices I&#39;ve
made and stuff that happened to me and
you know what it&#39;s about
because you have similar experiences
don&#39;t you I&#39;m thinking you sir maybe
have lost someone else so you know what
this is and I&#39;m thinking you MS you have
been in love yeah I can tell and
actually I think sir that there might be
a scar on that hand you&#39;re holding right
there no on the other hand okay that&#39;s
how he goes then on the other hand for
me it is not about replacing the human
being I think that would be a big
mistake rather than that we should take
these things all these wonderful
technologies of our time that are so
important to is and place them in these
loops and that helps us understand in
new and fascinating ways stuff that&#39;s
really really important and pertinent to
our own lives and I think that this way
of extending the Lube that is between
people can actually change the way that
we think not only about ourselves but
also about the people around us in a
very positive way so for me this is my
prism this is my thinking tool number
one for unlocking some of all that
mystery that&#39;s in the world and when I
do that yeah we&#39;re flying here that was
crazy when I do that lots of things
things popped to my attention that was
previously not so interesting and
perhaps not even visible to me
so the tiny differences in the way that
we act and the way that robots
communicate with us really accentuates
these wonderful things that are
important parts of our lives
and then sometimes incidentally when I
sit in my lap with all the computers and
all the data that we collected trying to
figure out what&#39;s going on in these
loops and I look across the table and I
see him I laugh a little bit and
sometimes I glance just a little little
thing there and you know what it is that
I see myself know I catch this tiny
little glimpse from time to time of my
father yeah he was blind and his eyes
would often walk across the room like
this without focusing on anything
particular I like the robot so I see him
and I remember and that makes me happy
have a nice day and stay in the loop
thank you
thank you
so um Henry cut I could ask you a
question though I mean I found it and
even right now I find it socially almost
uncomfortable standing next to your
power here like you don&#39;t know what to
do but and so I mean there&#39;s something
amazing here and that that physical
lightness you know it presses all kinds
of human buttons but at the same time
until you&#39;ve got the speech thing right
until we&#39;ve actually made progress in
artificial intelligence and it can feel
like a real conversation
it just seems creepy doesn&#39;t it not to
me do you why that this is in a way
possibly ahead of its time and that
until the artificial intelligence side
and the actual interaction side can be
solved it&#39;s kind of a dead end and
there&#39;s there&#39;s more that you know that
those flying nanobots is where the
robotic advances now I actually see
those things as converging we see so
many different kinds of of progress and
many many different technical
disciplines what what really is the the
stopping block at this moment is that we
need for all of those technologies to
converge and that is going to happen
over the next five to ten years so my
prediction would be that ten years from
now can get me back here and I will be
sitting at my home in sunny Denmark
enjoying a beer on my porch all right
and I will be doing this talk are you
willing to come sure thank you very much
thank you
right
