good morning everybody as June just
opened for the last 15 years I have
lived abroad and in five different
countries so as it happens whenever I
meet new people I get asked where are
you from and I get a hint of disbelief
in people&#39;s faces when I say Turkey they
go like really
you don&#39;t look Turkish which is puzzling
because I do look Turkish everybody in
Turkey has a cousin who looks like me
and then I feel like okay what&#39;s going
on here because outside Turkey the more
people I speak with the more I realize
that I don&#39;t fit to an image that exists
in the global consciousness I don&#39;t have
my clicker thank you and so then then I
wonder you know if I don&#39;t fit to a
typical Turkish for one image what is
typical in Turkey being at the
crossroads speak essentially a language
of many of us it&#39;s not related to any of
our neighbors it&#39;s not a continue we
have Middle Eastern religions we have a
European political system European
educational system everybody who goes to
school in Turkey will learn through and
through European culture and well we
have plenty of American television what
does that make us I suppose the typical
Turkish is diversity that&#39;s probably
what it should be
however people seem to have a kind of a
single story in their minds about wound
and Turkey and I don&#39;t fit so they asked
is it normal
you travel alone this is normal the way
you dress do you have to wear a
headscarf and you go back home I suppose
a fair question because this woman are
all Turkish you see a traditional
village folk in that is your left I
guess and well new urbanites I would say
with head scarves
these are Turkish women these are two
categories of Turkish woman but this
image particular image guess
to represent only part of the story we
do exist that I&#39;m gonna demonstrate that
to you in a minute but before I go on
and talk about the image and the look
because it goes beyond that I want to
talk to you about the mindset which is
actually still there in Turkey which
justifies also the question it surprises
people that an educated independent
woman comes and meets them and talks
about philosophy or science or whatever
because in today&#39;s Turkey there are less
than 50% women in the parliament
they don&#39;t make the rules seemingly one
in four women think that it&#39;s okay for
their husbands to beat them in some
regions we still have something called
honor killing and that seems to apply
only to women seems like for many people
men and women the notion that women are
people is still a radical one but is
that the mindset in entire church is
that the norm
am I really exceptional I started
questioning myself well I&#39;m here to tell
you that I&#39;m not and who knew being an
exceptional would get you stage time
right I have about 130 Turkish women in
my facebook page and here are few of
them and yes that&#39;s the average look
that&#39;s a composition obviously is a
genetically diverse set of people but
that&#39;s not the point it kind of is with
the crossroads I guess but they are all
emancipated independent educated women
they are women of rational thought
they&#39;re scientists doctors lawyers
businesswoman artists
sculptures they are all highly educated
and the night I wonder is this then
normal is this then well it is my normal
it is very normal if you grow up in
Turkey seemingly one on three women
actually have a very high education so
this is not a small number if you
actually go and do the math your uterus
you end up with a number that is over 10
million people and to conceptualize you
can think that if your
to declare independence we would make a
country larger than Switzerland not that
I&#39;m suggesting a woman obligation but
education is what I emphasize and the
reason I occasionally I am ffice Isaac
Asian is because that leads to economic
independence an economic independence
needs to make your own choices and
that&#39;s the key to decide what to do with
yourself or to wear whatever you want to
wear what to do where to live what to do
with your time and energy and money the
key benefit of economic independence at
the end of the day is having a sense of
entitlement to your own life it&#39;s most
valuable thing that you can have and
today easily more than ten million women
and as I&#39;d like to think just as many
men would not like to have it any other
way but how did you get there just about
a hundred years ago our grandparents
yours mine all over the world really had
a different norm for all of us it was
pretty clear that women were lesser
beings universities refused admitting
females
professional woman had to write under
male pen names and they had to pretend
to be men some of them to pursue their
passions I know a story of a Swiss woman
who pretended to be a man oh they&#39;re all
her entire life to be actually to be
able to perform as a doctor and some had
to do their science through their
husbands does it sounds real to you now
it does to me it&#39;s like it&#39;s like such a
long time ago but it is not it&#39;s really
only about 100 years ago and that is
about three generations and that&#39;s
exactly the time were in Turkey a
certain project started to gain momentum
which I think I&#39;m a direct result I&#39;ll
try to tell you just a little bit about
that so here&#39;s the project leader
his name is Ataturk if you know any
Turkish name you probably know his name
he has led many many daring changes in
twenties and
it is in Turkey and his legacy in
today&#39;s turkey is still an interesting
thing to study it&#39;s very valuable for
Turkish identity but when it comes to
women&#39;s rights in fast-forward at the
country level that with the Western some
accounts even exceeded it and in some
particular story he did something very
special work for him and he had opted a
number of children mostly girls and put
them in schools made sure that they got
education he appeared with them in
public instilling a sense of normal that
woman did sports they became
professionals we had world&#39;s first
female judge that was fully recognized
to do anything as opposed to other parts
of the world we had world&#39;s first female
jet pilot in the woman for granted of
world in Turkey in 1930 that is before
France Portugal Spain and Switzerland
but that&#39;s another story
because in Switzerland Alaskan Trump
gave the women right in 1991 right right
to hold and that&#39;s when Turkey actually
elected their first female prime
minister in 1930s my grandmother was
born this is her in a northeastern town
she could vote in her entire life but in
her surroundings women were still very
much lesser beings
nobody asked her what she wanted to be
when she grew up that&#39;s very different
for me and this is my mother 30 years
fast forward she&#39;s roaming in streets of
Ankara playfully posing as a cowboy
styling her hair&#39;s Oh Jeff Byrne and
she&#39;s a direct product of Ataturk&#39;s
vision she had a teacher who was an
agent of this change and that teacher
negotiated with my grandfather couldn&#39;t
really believe in educating girls all
that much the teacher went to her father
and said if it&#39;s a issue of money I&#39;m
gonna found her education she should
study and well my grandfather&#39;s pride
kind of conflicted with his values and
he said I was out paying for my own
children&#39;s education thank you so that
journey began but besides that teachers
extraordinary move for my mother&#39;s
generation
working was normal a lot of women worked
hundred percent of the time they raise
children and they have also did one
hundred percent of the housework blows
my mind but that&#39;s how it was thirty
years down the line when I went to
university a great proportion of my
professors were women and mind you I
studied technology and I have learned a
lot of my subjects from my teachers
throughout my life all the stuff women
my doctors were half them and I just
kind of list goes on and on so it is
very normal for me to be around
professional women who are independent
and I don&#39;t stand out if you ask me I am
just one in 10 million people and when I
was preparing for this talk a small
thing or a big thing rather happened in
Turkey a lot of people took to the
streets to protest demolition of a park
and then the authorities responded with
a lot of force and then the whole
discourse changed into protecting their
freedoms and now millions of people are
out in Turkey many women took the front
lines and these images might be familiar
to you to some of you because they have
become iconic and I want to say is it
normal for them to be there if there
they are they exist and they won&#39;t have
it any other way
thank you
