so this is a good friend of mine Jess
Rogers 2001 she went to hospital for a
routine operation and contracted an
infection during her stay she nearly
lost her life unfortunately she&#39;s not
the only one in the States alone 2
million people every year go to hospital
and pick up an infection it&#39;s crazy
right what&#39;s worse is nearly a hundred
thousand of those die every year this is
like last year&#39;s these are people who
went to hospital for care and got the
complete opposite the number one culprit
causing between forty to sixty percent
of cases of the of these infections is
poor hand hygiene so simply put doctors
and nurses and not washing their hands
properly now washing your hands properly
sounds really simple right but it&#39;s
actually quite complicated and quite
hard every time you touch a patient or
anything in their surroundings you have
to wash your hands pretty vigorously for
a nurse or a doctor that translates to
hundreds or thousands of times a day it
can take up to an hour of your day just
washing hands to be compliant and as
bodies around the world and sexual
control units in Australia but a task of
trying to get these people to comply
there&#39;s rules regulation training
auditing and in some extreme cases in
the state there are spies but go into
hospitals have observed the staff and if
they&#39;re not compliant the original
warning they may lose their job and all
of this hasn&#39;t fixed the problem so a
couple of months ago we were approached
just look at this problem differently
look at this through the lens of design
now we&#39;re a bunch of creatives and
technologists importantly we don&#39;t know
anything about health care so when nighy
to this problem and we don&#39;t bring all
the bias in the history that a lot of
people who work in industry has and we
discovered some something pretty
interesting and surprising to everybody
so I first step was to understand the
problem at a deeper level so Tim our
senior experience designer collaborated
with Don and Keith who run Monash health
so a group of hospitals in Melbourne and
he spent some time in hospitals to
understand this problem and he got
literally honey i dint ified the chili
hundreds of problems that were causing
this issue from simple things like the
actual location of these hand sanitizer
pump these think things you can see
through to the actual practicality of
how they work when you&#39;re in a
high-pressure situation you quickly push
down on one of these pumps the nozzle
can spin around squirt stuff everywhere
you know you&#39;ve done that yourself there
are much broader issues as well where
there&#39;s well there&#39;s an awareness that
this needs to happen the doctors and
nurses don&#39;t truly understand the
importance of hand hygiene in delivering
patient care they see it more as a chore
and we came across something even more
challenging in the first couple of weeks
the senior staff the doctor senior
doctors and nurses started to actually
reject Tim they didn&#39;t want didn&#39;t like
his presence there he was seen as
another guy from inspect infection
control who was looking at them judging
them and going to trick critique them so
this is a really important part in this
project a moment we realized that up
until now all these bodies around the
world have been looking at the doctors
and the nurses as the bad guys they&#39;ve
been looking at them as the problem when
really these people are hardworking
people hard-working trying to deliver
patient care they&#39;re really the good
diet so at this point we change our
approach in the project and we got them
involved in the process as opposed to
observing them can from the outside so a
next step was to take these hundreds of
problems that we&#39;d identified and group
them into five core problem themes from
simple things like the education
understanding about this issues with
patients and staff the practicalities of
the products that I spoke about that the
challenges of the interaction with
patients which which they&#39;re in numerous
there&#39;s a real lack of data around usage
of the pumps and the broader cultural
issues at an organizational level that
exists
so we took these five problems aims and
workshop them with with 60 designers
developers doctors and nurses in a
really high energy session and generated
hundreds of ideas the energy in the room
was amazing one of the one of the nurses
in my group changed from the start of
the session being quite dismissive and a
bit deflated she really didn&#39;t want to
be there and by the end of it she was
beaming with energy and coming up with
some crazy ideas for the first time
she&#39;d been seen as not the problem as a
part of the solution for the first time
miss P staff were empowered to solve
this problem so we&#39;re looking at a bunch
of these ideas and exploring
implementing them we&#39;re going to be
enormous for a few months so it&#39;s early
days just simple things like improving
these pumps to make them not spin around
and other things the staff that got
fired up from this workshop have since
gone off and then a day-to-day basis in
the hospitals are trialing different
things to try and solve this problem
this one example is where they put tape
simply put tape around the floor of the
bed and they call it the zone of safety
so it&#39;s a message to each other but when
you&#39;re in that zone you need to be hyper
aware of the safety of the patient and
the number one priority is hand hygiene
just simplifying a very complicated
problem we&#39;re also looking at ways that
we can capture data next slide of the
pump they currently changed at random no
one knows how much is being used where
and when so we&#39;re looking at very simple
ways like logbooks or things like NFC to
capture this data and feed it back into
the teams so they are enabled to be able
to problem-solve as they go but the
thing that&#39;s most exciting had on the
head of general medicine medicine for
Monash health is the fact that the staff
have gone from being completely
disengaged in this problem seeing it is
more of a chore the evil bad guys from
infection control who comes with and you
know tell them off to now being actively
engaged in it they&#39;ve taken ownership of
this problem and a trialing ways to fix
it that was something completely
unexpected for all
so we hope that this change in culture
and looking at the people who want to
live a care as looking at them as the
solution not the problem well one day
see a reduction in the number of people
for cashing in section when they did it
hospital thank you
