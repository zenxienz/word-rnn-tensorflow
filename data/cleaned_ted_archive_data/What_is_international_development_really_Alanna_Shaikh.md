I&#39;m pretty excited to be here and be
giving a talk that&#39;s not gonna make me
cry on stage I&#39;ve been working in
international development for almost 15
years and the more time I spend working
in this field the more I realize just
how much I don&#39;t know so today I&#39;m going
to talk about three things that you
probably don&#39;t know about international
development the first thing is we don&#39;t
actually know what international
development is one of the major
activities for academics in this field
is arguing about a proper definition
pretty much any report or article about
development has to start by defining its
terms because there is no set definition
we have some definitions that are in
play though the UN definition is the
reduction of poverty and achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals nice
solid basic sort of definition gets a
lot of use right now the 1960s
definition very idealistic it&#39;s the
liberation of people and people&#39;s based
on structural transformation which is a
fantastic definition with this idea that
we&#39;d actually changed the global economy
to help the poorest to the poor and I
think it&#39;s really a reproach to us that
we&#39;ve moved away from thinking that big
there&#39;s the postmodern definition a set
of ideas that shapes power relations
because they value certain things over
other things now in this case the things
they value are paved roads and clean
water and the things that they&#39;re
valuing over our unpaved roads and water
that might make you sick so that&#39;s a
value judgment I&#39;m comfortable with but
this definition is an important reminder
that it is a value judgment
finally like the economist Amartya Sen
defines development as freedom and I
think that&#39;s probably my favorite
definition now dr. Sen had five aspects
to freedom he had Economic Opportunity
social opportunity security government
transparency
and I forgot one Guernica moment you all
right we&#39;re just gonna move on okay the
second fact that you probably don&#39;t know
about international development is it&#39;s
about a whole lot more than just
official development aid there&#39;s a lot
of things we can do that would help the
developing world that aren&#39;t about it
changing trade policies in wealthy
countries would benefit people in
developing countries right now we
encourage the developing world to
embrace free trade to abandon
protectionist barriers while the
countries in Europe and the United
States continue to keep up our own
tariffs to protect our farmers Bill
Clinton actually apologized to Haiti for
what he&#39;d done to their economy by
encouraging them to embrace free trade
while not changing American policies
allowing more immigration into wealthy
countries would benefit developing
countries now this is kind of a
controversial topic so we don&#39;t tend to
talk about it that much but the fact is
Filipino migrant workers sent home
twenty four billion dollars in 2012
that&#39;s 10 percent of the national GDP
Tajikistan little tiny country migrant
workers sent home three billion dollars
in 2011 that&#39;s forty five percent of the
national GDP Mexican workers sent back
twenty two billion dollars that&#39;s a
whole lot of money that dwarfs the money
they&#39;re getting in aid slowing climate
change would benefit people in
developing countries developing
countries contribute the least to our
carbon burden and they&#39;re going to
suffer the most from the impacts of
climate change this little girl in
Pakistan surviving a flood could
probably tell you a little bit about
surviving climate change that she did
not cause the third thing that you
didn&#39;t know about international
development is that the developing world
is actually subsidizing us for every
dollar that the developing world gets in
aid ten dollars flow out into tax havens
and international banks because of
elicit dictator spending they hide their
money Mexico lost fifty two billion
dollars in 2010 in illicit capital flows
they lost four hundred and seventy six
billion over the last decade and that
doesn&#39;t even count the billions of
dollars in hard cash that left smuggled
out in cars over land borders finally
when developing countries need to
improve their infrastructure they don&#39;t
have the equipment or the capacity to do
these kinds of projects themselves so
they hire big construction firms from
wealthy countries to come in and do it
for them
for example Turkmenistan has paid two
billion dollars to a French contracting
firm to build monuments and roads and
bridges and a giant artificial lake in
the country this mosque cost sixty
million dollars to build now what all of
this means is the International
Development it&#39;s surprisingly personal
and if you want to get involved in
development and make a difference you
have to define for yourself what
development means for you
and what about development is the place
that you want to make your change and
that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean giving
more money and aid it might mean that
you want to advocate for changing your
country&#39;s trade policy or immigration
policy just to close things up this is
my definition of international
development that boy in the green shirt
there that&#39;s my son
and he&#39;s there with three of his friends
from Tajikistan and what I want is each
of those Tajikistan and education and
the opportunity to build themselves a
life that my little American boy has
thanks
