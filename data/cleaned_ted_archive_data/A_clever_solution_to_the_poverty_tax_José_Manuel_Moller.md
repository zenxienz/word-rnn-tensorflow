for usable was a stud in major in
economics I left home and I moved to a
poor neighborhood in Dodge curve
Santiago called la Granja there I spend
here and a half without a three friends
and I was in charge of buying every day
groceries and because although stood an
income I have to buy small quantity in a
small packaging on a daily basis in
Chile the local grow store and all of
America are cold and messiness and there
are extensions of the shop owners house
this is what the non messin looks like
and it&#39;s this place where all the
neighbors by everyday basics and talked
with each other while I was doing this I
realized that it was falling prey what
we have called the poverty tax and
explain I was by a quarter of leader of
kokino for a dollar and five cents
that&#39;s four door and twenty cents per
month per liter but in the supermarket
you can get one little of cooking oil
for just three doors so I space for the
percentage more just because I couldn&#39;t
afford the bigger package this is
happening in all Latin America affect 85
percentage of the population we have
called it poor attacks because family
space more just because they&#39;re
low-income its widespread all local
store around the world poor just can
effort bigger packaging so it was in
this context that idea for gram occurred
to me it was possible to reduce
dispenses on groceries in a sustainable
way in partnership with the local source
so what do we do we buy in bulk and we
sell these small quantities to add
unique suspense machine that we develop
this machine so how does it work first
you get the container on your local
store 447 reusable container so you put
the container on the machine then you
pick the product in this case will be
right then the screen let&#39;s say it&#39;s
really you put the kinds of a here and
then duction button this way the machine
will fill the container the family just
paid for the brother and
you done ways ok so our supply chain is
marked and also shorter that in
traditional one because we take the
product in bulk directly to our machines
allow us to say a lot save a lot in
packaging logistic and receive water
reducing the traditional number of for
visible to a single one off we call this
the revolutionary smart wave by because
we sell in bulk prices but in small
quantities win so this machine in the
shop for free and then we split the
profit with the shopkeeper fifty fifty
families save around for the percentage
compared we are packaged competitors in
the same level stores with this system
the shopkeeper can compete with the big
griddle prices in a strainer in every
way bringing them a unit competitive
advantage dispense machine or customer
now can get the big supermarket prices
but in their local neighborhood stores
and this is also sell turing machine
that allows the shopkeeper to save time
but another customers or cellular
products like bread for example we&#39;re
aiming to keep this local store in your
neighborhood because in this one mustn&#39;t
is where the people getting touched
talked for a while and where the
community wants are forged that&#39;s the
reason that we want to make sure that
you have a real chance to compete with a
big conglomerate supermarket now we are
pressing more than hundred locally owned
stores impacting more than 12,000 people
in just six months next year will be
open or first operation colombia bogota
but our more ambitious plan is in fact
all that in America within 10 years with
this system chilean now can buy within
the local community while saving that
allows them to purchase other product
otherwise they cannot afford when
budgets are so tight every peso counts
and can make a real difference for
example access to a barrel education or
even access to a little healthier we are
doing our grammar not because it&#39;s just
innovated at sustainable we&#39;re doing it
because we strongly believe this is a
first solution for a problem of mineral
families
this is al grano the revolutionaries my
wave I&#39;m supporting family owned
business and eliminating the board
attacks thank you muchas gracias
