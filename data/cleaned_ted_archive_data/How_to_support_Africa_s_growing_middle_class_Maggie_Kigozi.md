who is an African here yeah so Africa is
rightly this is a term that has been
coined to describe Africa&#39;s rapid growth
since 2000 and the inevitability of the
continuation of father rapid growth on
the continent yes Africa is rising
Uganda where I come from reduced poverty
from 56% to nineteen percent gdp growth
in the whole of East Africa is over five
percent the middle class is growing you
guys middle class right there and
urbanization is fast fastest in the
world therefore we have local markets we
have regional markets and we have global
markets for us Africa also is gifted we
are so incredibly resource-rich we have
people you 1.7 billion people both men
and women highly educated we are sitting
in a university today very skilled and
very entrepreneurial so the services
have worked for us so far that&#39;s what
makes driving our economies right now
education health finance ICT the service
sectors agriculture huge potential we
can produce food will feed the world
minerals oil and gas tourism we still
have the animals no one else does Audrey
and Lance we have learned that is not
being utilized so is greatly
underutilized so Africa will rise but it
will only do that if we as Africa can
begin to export value added products the
existing trade imbalance between us and
others is caused by exporting
commodities we export we still
unfortunately largely export commodities
and we import those expensive finished
products that we all love
Africa for example produce 75% of cocoa
in the world and out of the hundred
billion dollars that the chocolate
market is we go two percent we got two
percent and so similarly coffee please
you name it cotton that&#39;s the situation
so we are gifted we agree we have all
these resources why is value addition
not happening as it should and value
addition basically is manufacturing why
isn&#39;t it happening number one the
biggest problem was infrastructure you
know without energy you know it&#39;s
expensive isn&#39;t you unreliable that&#39;s
what we had transport our railway you
know how that was how that is and the
roads you know and Airlines we had face
various problems but i&#39;m happy to report
on that front government focus on
infrastructures huge there&#39;s a lot
happening i&#39;m excited about the standard
gauge railway for example that&#39;s
happening between nairobi all the way to
Kigali and you know that has fantastic
that&#39;s incredible so solutions are being
found for that number one challenge that
we&#39;ve been facing the second challenge
land for investments land in Africa is
personal it belongs to us and it&#39;s
something we all take very seriously we
need land if we are going to add value
we need land for industry particularly
we do need land for agriculture we need
land for other things so in order to add
value the land challenge must be
addressed and this is in Uganda much of
Africa land belongs to the people status
investors can come on by and leased land
you can invest a freaking investors in
their own places their own countries can
buy land and own it foreigners can lease
land which is okay 45 years 99 years and
then it comes back to to to the country
or the local owners which is fine
the challenge is can you get like that
is it easily accessible and the truth of
the matter is it not investors are
forced by bad land which is unused
wetlands forests and they&#39;re scattered
so we have not industrial parks but
investors companies scattered all over
the country which it makes it very
difficult for government officials as
well it&#39;s very difficult for the
investor themselves they have to put
rods in place they have to have sewage
they have all these things which makes
their business brilliant competitive but
even government officials is difficult
for the labor unions and the labor
officers and the revenues Eric and
others to get to these companies that
are scattered all over the place so what
is a solution industrial parks in all
urban centers are critical we must as
Africans have industrial areas in all
urban centers in order to add value make
it easy what are the advantages there is
immediate access to substract in an
industrial park the investor does not
have to take months and years trying to
sort out all these problems I talked
about earlier it&#39;s electricity water
they need three phase electricity so
it&#39;s not just any old electricity you
don&#39;t just set up in the village and
hope you can set up an industry you
can&#39;t so those are problems then
government officials can help you we
hope most times and also oversee
regulates whatever you&#39;re doing then
proximity to other companies so the
value chain you have your suppliers of
packaging all around you in the same
area and you have proximity to logistics
you need to export for example we&#39;re
talking about exports here so the the
train station you know the logistics
come together for all of you in the
industrial area so what needs to be done
yes I know we have some industry areas
you&#39;ve seen some their way around we
need to plan as it is better and in
planning the cities and the clowns even
the smaller towns are going to grow
I talked about urbanization earlier
they&#39;re going to grow so you need to
plan early to have landfill industry
demarcated in all urban centers and it&#39;s
not a small amount of land maybe about a
thousand acres some companies need up to
50 acres just for one company so about a
thousand acres you need to plan what do
you want what is in your interest as a
nation is it agro processing zones is it
export zones is it heavy industry and
special economic zones will be essential
for our companies to set up quite easily
then we need to give incentives for
manufacturing these exist in quite a
number of countries already in the form
of accelerated depreciation export
incentives tax holidays and such and
then skills availability where are the
skills I know in a country like mine or
vocational colleges were made into
universities and we lost that middle
group of technocrats that the
manufacturers need we need to move
backwards and make sure we have the
technical skills at these people need so
to wrap up by enabling manufacturing and
therefore value addition to Africa&#39;s
rich resources through industrial park
development Africa will continue to rise
we will succeed thank you very much
