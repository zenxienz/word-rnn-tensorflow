oh I am in a secret on disclosable
location somewhere backstage because I
am so tired I am so exhausted from this
conference and also i feel so thin on
stage this is fantastic actually I&#39;m
here for a very important something I
want to convince you of i deserve the
TED Prize and the x prize for the robot
with artificial intelligence who&#39;s
giving a dad talk right now they thought
it could only be done in 20 years maybe
I did in the day and a half and here&#39;s
my evidence one I came to this
conference not really believing in free
will at all and now I even believe in it
less than I did we are filled with
microbes and parasites that control our
behavior so I argue that I am already a
robot in fact I am one of those quiet
people who really just wants to be at
home reading and watching movies but i
think i have a parasite of me that can
only reproduce under the condition of
being on the Ted stage getting laughs so
for those of you the left thank you and
for the leaving my parasite second of
all my intelligence is artificial ask
anyone who knows me and third I was a
blank slate and I came here not knowing
anything and I constructed this entire
TED talk all on my own so come on I get
the prize I did it I did it the day and
a half oh wait
behind me not me get out of here this is
so embarrassing I am so sorry about that
go okay so last year they asked me to do
the wrap up and I told you that I called
my aunt Bonnie at the end of every Ted
who lives in Seattle and I give her the
she wants to be the first person to hear
what happened to Ted and I can&#39;t help it
I just had to do it again so this is
what my call to aunt bonnie is gonna be
like Oh Bonnie okay so first we&#39;re in
Vancouver it&#39;s really overcast and rainy
and cold not like those California
locations where you want to be outside
which is probably good because you spend
all of your time in sight anyway so I
think their idea was just making it
really miserable outside so we just
wanted to be inside which i think is a
home run they built this huge stage I
think if you look across the water you
see this little patch of area that&#39;s
been deforested and I think that&#39;s what
they used to build this
stage but you know what good because the
stage is fantastic this is my favorite
stage of all the stages from long beach
in Monterey the ones that I&#39;ve been at I
absolutely love it getting in is really
difficult and kind of frantic but I
think they&#39;re going to consult with
temple grandin on how to like calm us
down by squeezing us as we entered the
stage at the theater for next year so I
think that&#39;s going to be really really
good and the speakers were so great oh
my god there was that astronaut there
who&#39;s saying Major Tom from space and
heated this whole speech about how he is
terrified of spiders who knew he is a
man who is so afraid of spiders he had
to become an astronaut and go to space
and then one-time money he was hanging
outside the space station he thought of
spiders and he started crying and
implied it out
the thing can find out then there&#39;s this
guy from the MIT Media Lab by the way
every other person on stage was from the
MIT Media Lab this was like I think it
was a secret MIT Media Lab conference
with Ted and anyway this guy negroponte
a we learned about his obsession with
his old bald spot which I understand
that is very hard but we also he&#39;s the
guy who wants every kid in the world one
child one laptop and I was thinking the
synergy of Ted if he could just get
together with the 3d printer people
maybe from the pictures we saw of those
kids they could print some food for the
kids to just eat ok now that&#39;s going too
far all right he also thinks but in the
future we&#39;re just going to be able to
take a pill and like you just take a
pill and know all of Shakespeare and
come on maybe that means we&#39;ll just have
a ted pill and i was thinking it&#39;s
probably still gonna cost like nine
thousand dollars but you&#39;ll save airfare
the same airfare and i&#39;m one question
for chris how much are the donor pills
gonna cost ok
then there was a skype and ferret he&#39;s
some fantastic designer guy and he told
us about going to the Parthenon when he
was age 9 and he had a complete epiphany
understanding all of the you know waves
that the Parthenon ceiling was made and
how difficult it was and the engineering
involved and the beauty of the art and
this was just not a good talk for my
daughter Mulan to have me see because
now when I take her to the parking on if
she does not have a life changing
experience when she looks at the ceiling
lifetime of disappointment from me
that&#39;s all I have to say also I learned
from him that you can drop your kid off
at a science museum in the morning and
just come back at night oh that was
great okay Ben we got to see Ed Snowden
who was in you know his undisclosed
location somewhere in Russia and I know
you know and I to me he&#39;s a hero i
really i really love him and what he did
but of course you know I don&#39;t know I
guess it&#39;s the girl and meet all I
wanted Krista asked him is what about
your girlfriend what happened to your
girlfriend you just left her and was
this not just an elaborate ploy to get
out of your relationship
girls it my question for him and then we
had the NSA director and I&#39;ll Bonnie I
know you&#39;re worried about the NSA
gathering up all this information he
totally put our minds at rest you all
should not be worried about that first
of all he said Snowden should have not
done what he did he should have just
gone to his superiors in Hawaii the next
guy up and said oh by the way I&#39;ve just
discovered that every single thing we&#39;re
doing is immoral wrong and illegal and
that I would have immediately God to
Washington and got the attention of the
President and Congress and everyone else
I&#39;m sure that would have happened just
through
you
honey don&#39;t worry I know you really have
said about all the information they&#39;re
getting he described this thing they
have that&#39;s in place it&#39;s part of their
protocol called minimized once they&#39;ve
taken all of your metadata they know
your phone calls all the emails under
certain details but who you wrote to and
who wrote back to you once they&#39;ve gone
to that if you don&#39;t trigger something
on some long undisclosed list of
attributes that they&#39;re looking for then
they put in this thing called minimize
where they completely leave you alone so
isn&#39;t that great he does believe in
privacy it&#39;s kind of like if the
government said look we&#39;re gonna come in
and ransack your house at any moment and
if we don&#39;t find anything come on you
have your privacy so that made me feel
then why Michelle the bears oh my god I
loved him he was this guy who was a
printer making junk mail and then at age
40 had a huge epiphany that he should be
a nuclear fusion scientists you know in
that way the guys who worked at Kinkos
are all actors in Vancouver their
nuclear physicist oh and then the gates
are here oh my god it was so fantastic
first of all they were totally lovable
they shared all kinds of great stories
going to Africa and staying with a
family that doesn&#39;t have electricity and
the daughter of the family just asked
for one thing to have the rei light on
on their daughters lamp if she could
have that so she could study at night
and i felt like the whole audience was
like give them the family and rei
headlight please right now you&#39;re the
gate but the amazing thing about them is
that that i learned about that was a
couple they shared a lot of pictures of
them in Bermuda shorts walking on the
Sun set on beaches and apparently both
of them love to walk on beaches and talk
about how to spend billions of dollars I
am so happy we found each other
what are the chances what do you like to
do I like to walk on beaches at sunset
and think about spend billions of
dollars highlight then there was this
guy Alan Adams this physicist who was
trying to explain to us about black
holes which was great because he really
had incredible analogies this fish and
Bonnie during the middle of his he
started getting sucked into a black hole
[Applause]
it was he you can just see in one room I
need radical tactile feeling of what a
black hole must feel like
amazing
and there was this cliff Chris Kluwe guy
from the NFL who things I didn&#39;t notice
you learn so much attend that millions
and millions of people want to know what
it&#39;s like to get tackled and it could be
billions of dollars from the future
because so many people want to get
tackle which is amazing because we
watched a little bit a couple of times
if somebody getting tackled and knowing
more about what it was like to get
tackled okay but I have to end of this
the guy who stole my heart is the
conference Rob Knight the microbe guy
okay Bonnie you know how have struggled
with weight issues my whole life of you
hassle everyone our family turns out our
bodies are filled with these microbes
they totally have a huge set maybe
dictate how would you way there in your
gut you turn your vagina there in your
mouth and apparently having antibiotics
really screws with this and you need
antibiotics you know my mother what
months of my entire childhood was I not
on antibiotics okay I remember my mother
going to the doctor on the way and she
said we&#39;re not leaving his office until
I have a prescription for antibiotics
like I can&#39;t about it constantly when I
got my first pimple when I was 13 my
mother put me and this is no joke now on
tetracycline for four years straight
yeah but actually made me feel something
because I can&#39;t believe I don&#39;t wait
five hundred pounds seriously
considering that but anyway Bonnie when
you go to Ted you&#39;re so filled with with
making connections and when I was
learning about those microbes and
thinking about the microbes in my own
cut you know my daughter Lou lon we
don&#39;t share the same DNA because I
adopted her and she is super thin and
athletic and now she&#39;s 14 and she gives
me this looks like you can just eat my
 and now I think that it&#39;s a very
good idea
but then the entrepreneurial spirit
infused me and I started thinking oh my
god this guy Rob Knight has changed my
life I&#39;m gonna start a business a
probiotic yogurt I could be the
spokesman like another middle-aged
address with shorter hair and instead of
saying fruit on the bottom it will say
fruit from the bottom started on all the
ideas that this has caused I mean just
think about my Grob saturated condoms I
mean come on talk about efficient
delivery okay that was going too far
he&#39;s a comedian oh and my last idea was
that I think of Bill Gates another mean
one and then I&#39;ll leave I think the kids
should use some of his money even though
I really am happy with all the wonderful
things that they&#39;re doing with their
money to get together um with Stewart
Brand I always want to say Russell Brand
the store brand and bring back the
passenger pigeon so that they get so
that Microsoft can finally have a
reliable way to deliver attachments I&#39;m
a Mac user I&#39;m a Mac user
ok so now this conference was great I
totally love it here this is my favorite
stage I love being able to come and see
people sometimes like you know like I I
people tell me they have this with me a
little bit but I see people i think i
know them but i don&#39;t know them like
they&#39;re famous who i&#39;m like oh like that
and when you&#39;re a cab that&#39;s how it is
over and over again i love this
community and i hope that i&#39;m coming for
the next 30 years and thank you this is
a great dad thank you so much
[Applause]
