hi our physical world
coming smart everyday objects
increasingly have sensors processors and
communications capabilities forming a
so-called Internet of Things or network
of smart objects and increasingly we
find these smart objects on people for
example and soon inside of people
fitness trackers health trackers
smartwatches smart phone smart glasses
you can even buy a connected toothbrush
these days our cars of course are
increasingly chatting with one another
with smart traffic systems finding out
about weather and so on in our homes
increasingly are connected as well with
smart alarm systems smart thermostat
smart lights increasingly our cities are
becoming connected monitoring traffic
parking energy use and more but what
bothers me about all of this is that
this smart world is largely fragmented
right now and very incomprehensible by
Pia two people and the question that my
students and I have been focused on
recently is how can we make this world
of smart objects more human how can we
make it accessible to all and the
solution that we&#39;ve come up with and
which I&#39;d like to talk about today is to
map software functionality onto smart
objects to extend their physical
capabilities for example here we have a
radio with a tuning knob and a volume
knob and you can access additional
functionality in this radio simply by
holding your phone tablet or smart
glasses over it for example here we&#39;re
changing the behavior of the radio so
that the different tuning knob settings
play different playlists that we have
and once you&#39;ve customized or changed
your radio you can of course just use
the physical buttons you don&#39;t need to
use the phone or tablet anymore but just
like Tim berners-lee 25 years ago was
motivated to make it easier to connect
different documents existing on
different compute
we want to make it really simple and
straightforward to connect different
Smart Objects with one another and so
you can use the same overlaid interface
to for example connect your smart radio
to a smart speaker if you no longer want
a connection you simply cross the line
there between the output of one and the
input of the other notice that this
whole approach is actually based on open
web standards so that anyone can create
one of these smart objects and it can
become part of the whole ecosystem
here&#39;s another example Valentin in the
video here wants to be able to control
all the lights in the room with just one
simple knob so it doesn&#39;t have to go
round and turn all of them on and off
every time so he simply uses this
interface to draw connections between
all of them and can then just use one
knob to turn them all on and off if you
you can connect the smart objects in
your home to the smart grid and the
smart city here we&#39;re finding out what
the price of electricity is different
times of the day connecting that to the
dryers so that the dryer will
automatically run when the price of
electricity is lowest we think this
approach has a lot of potential for
education learning and play here&#39;s my
nine-year-old son putting together a
motor a robotic car with two smart
sensors two smart motors he can just
take a picture of that car to create a
custom remote control for the carriages
built and he can program his robotic car
simply by drawing on the screen
connecting the sensors to elements like
inverters scalars and so on and through
the motors and he gets immediate
feedback about the program that he just
gave his car and can see what the
resulting behavior is like you can
create or you can create connections or
links between the smart sensors on your
body
and the smart environment around you
here we&#39;re looking at real time data of
Valentin&#39;s temperature galvanic skin
response and heart rate he can connect
those to the color of the lights the
smart light in the room so that he gets
feedback while he&#39;s meditating about how
effective he is at reducing his heart
rate we call this approach smarter
objects because these smarter objects
basically combine the best of both the
digital world and the physical world the
infinite extensibility adaptability of
digital smart objects with the elegant
simple designs of physical objects and
we hope that this approach basically
will make this whole internet of things
a lot more transparent and a lot more
accessible to all I want to end by
thanking Valentin Hearn who&#39;s somewhere
in the audience here over there who&#39;s
one of the brilliant students I get to
work with every day at MIT and who is
the main person working on this project
thank you
