at 21 I was a junior at Wesleyan
University I decided to spend a semester
abroad but I made a choice that many
including my parents found peculiar I
chose to go to the slums of Nairobi
Kenya at 21 I knew that
I&#39;ll never make it by this time most of
my friends have died from violence
disease or Shia hopelessness it was a
tough life and I knew that my future
prospect depends only on a place I was
raised
Kibera the largest slum in Africa in
Kibera I taught myself how to read from
collecting scraps of newspapers from the
trash
my only schooling was life hard lessons
that I learned on the street as a
homeless child that was your fate if you
grew up in a place like Kiara obviously
Kennedy and I could not have been more
different from the moment I was born in
Denver Colorado I had a shot at an
education a future as a teenager the
issues I struggled with were what
college I might go to or what shoes to
wear to school I never had shoes I&#39;m Tim
I was 16 years old
so how is it you&#39;re probably asking
yourself that we found each other and
together are building a movement that&#39;s
transforming urban poverty into urban
promise the answer is forgiveness people
tend to think of forgiveness as an
all-or-nothing proposition either you
forgiving someone or you haven&#39;t this
makes it really hard to do and often
impossible to start we think of
forgiveness in stages we are going to
tell you three stages of forgiveness to
do this you need to understand how I got
to keep
in the first place after deciding to
spend my semester abroad in Nairobi I by
chance found out about Kennedy and his
community organization shining hope for
communities our Shaco that he&#39;d started
in Kibera
shaf Co provides services that interrupt
survival mode organizes communities and
empowers girls who will become the
leaders of the future from Denver I
wrote an email introducing myself and
offering my help
dear Kennedy the email started an email
from Hawaii gal in America who wanted to
help us another white Savior I thought
as if my content was not ruined by white
colonists by Christian missionaries who
wanted to help by the Potala zoom that
exists in the NGO framework Outsiders
cannot solve our problems in Kibera we
can solve our own problems that&#39;s why I
set out to start chovka
as my mom always say only he who wears
the shoes knows exactly white speeches
after some time I finally got a response
from him asking for my resume I spent a
lot of time working on that resume
though something special about this gun
so I Tola but you can come to help us
you can only come to partner with us I
was painfully aware of the legacy of
colonialism aware of the permanence of
privilege imprinted on my own body aware
that these privileges were so randomly
given to me while others were just as
randomly denied
I did nothing to be born in Denver
Kennedy did nothing to be born in Kibera
and yet this is what happened I would
have been paralyzed by guilt about my
privilege except that Kennedy said to me
with great compassion
Jessica you can represent all the white
people this is a lottery
guilt is a luxury we think the first
stage of forgiveness is tolerance today
tolerance has fallen out of fashion it&#39;s
considered neutral at best and
patronizing at worst Torrance is a
simple acknowledgement of another
person&#39;s existence tolerance gives you a
little space to breathe from there you
can recover from the source of your
grief and regain your strength
therefore the first step of forgiveness
is tolerance I decided that the only way
I could understand the community and
authentically serve Shopko was if I
lived in Kibera too so I told Kennedy I
was moving in you are crazy you can live
in a 10 by 10 room where there is no
running water there is no toilet has
ever been a white person living inside
Islam don&#39;t be ridiculous
I told him you&#39;re not the boss of me I
reminded him if you can live there why
can&#39;t I what would your parents say
Alaska I don&#39;t plan on telling them
I&#39;ve always found it easier to ask for
forgiveness than permission this bring
you to the next second stage of
forgiveness which is forgetting
unlike tolerance forgetting is active
when you intentionally forget you create
the space for something new
most of us spend a lot of time in
default mode acting on beliefs and
worldviews shaped by our past experience
too often we get stuck because these
beliefs and worldviews become invisible
to us unconscious when I moved into the
slums of Kibera
I forgot my parents worries my country&#39;s
warnings growing up in a place like
Kiara there is a need for intentional
forgetting or else we&#39;ll be stuck
forever in my alley life experience I
learned that if you have born poor you
and life has no value and it might
shatter life
I also learned that when you draw the
short straw in life nobody cares if you
live or if you die after forgive those
who watched while my friends died I also
have to forgive those who drew the long
straw otherwise I&#39;ll be stuck forever
forgetting allows you to move forward it
can give you a new lease on life so that
you build a new worldview Jessica moved
Nikki Bella in our simple house and for
one week my curious neighbor&#39;s were
knocking the door to find out if that
white girl survived the night
I survived and then we fell in love
despite the challenges and differences
that exist between us such as white and
black poor and rich men and women not
like it was all roses we had plenty of
fights we still do there is and despite
all those challenges I spoke about I
asked her to marry me and she says yes
except that before he asked me to marry
him he tricked me into getting married
when I said it&#39;s better to ask
forgiveness than permission I didn&#39;t
mean this
let me explain there is a culture in my
tradition but before you leave the
country you must build a house and
because I got a scholarship to study in
America I had to build a house and
building a house is also a process of
the wedding rituals except all he tells
me is we have to build some Hut in some
village before he can leave the country
so what can I do but agree and then
there I am standing there encircled by
his entire family in the empty space
where the house will be built and
there&#39;s a matriarch reciting what are
clearly prayers and though I don&#39;t speak
Luo I get the gist
and then suddenly she takes my hand and
places it in Kennedy&#39;s and that&#39;s when
it hits me Kennedy is this a wedding a
wedding looks the same in any language
I knew you&#39;ll understand you did give me
you didn&#39;t give me a chance to
understand and then it was too late I
have to admit probably that I could have
told you but I knew I wanted to build my
house life with and after a while I
forgave him because I knew I wanted to
build a life with Kennedy to this bring
me today final and the third stage of
forgiveness which is release when you
release you set yourself free grudges
bitterness resentment they&#39;re all
burdens they narrow our options our
relationships our experiences of life
forgiveness releases us forgiveness
doesn&#39;t delete the past forgiveness
enriches the future forgiveness doesn&#39;t
mean that you give up your boundaries or
your identity it&#39;s not surrender but it
is new space new potential and
forgiveness has to come from the
position of power and forgiveness can&#39;t
be rushed
there are times and situations where it
is so difficult it seems almost
impossible for example I remember when I
was a little boy my father did terrible
things he&#39;s told the little money my
mamma&#39;s aunt for food and he spend it on
alcohol he was drunk and violent I was
only six years old and I wanted him to
love me
you still do but I never understood why
he never treated me like his son when I
first met Kennedy&#39;s
father he asked me what do you want with
my son son he called me son
then he asked me do you even love my son
she told him she loved me when he left I
asked Kennedy how he could possibly
forgive his father forgiveness is not
about him I told her forgiveness is
about me life is about what you hold on
to and what you release that&#39;s what
makes or destroys you and I&#39;m not fully
forgiven him hundred percent because
forgiveness is a process the important
thing with forgiveness is to start you
have the rest of your life to finish you
have to realize that nothing is as
straightforward as unchanged with fear
as perhaps I&#39;d once thought not love not
Parenthood no act as daring as claiming
another as your own despite all the
human progress
that&#39;ll be made in the one today but
there&#39;s still so much violence so much
and oppression so much fear so much
us-versus-them we think forgiveness is a
big idea but not forgiveness granted in
a rush not forgiveness granted out of
fear but forgiveness granted slowly
steady with
heart of compassion when we forgive it
creates new space that space might hold
the possibility for a child for a new
philosophy for a business idea but in
our case it created the space for an
organization that is transforming
realities for the urban poor changing
tens of thousands of lives but if that
space is blocked by anger and that
nothing will grow the final state of
forgiveness the release is often marked
by some sort of ritual you know a case
we had to do big ritual and this so that
we can overcome the legacy of
colonization black and white poor and
rich and our ritual has been our work
together we understood that we are
stronger together that together we could
do so much more we could be a bridge
between our two continents our two
worlds that we could do so much more
than we thought possible
today in our community is more and more
women report becoming financially
empowered participating in household
decisions men are becoming champions of
girls rights community members from
different tribes are coming together to
promote peace and our girls never cease
to amaze us they continue to be at the
very top of their entire district but
fighting for this change and loving each
other along the way hasn&#39;t always been
easy I learned that I can&#39;t walk in
Kennedy&#39;s shoes I learned I can&#39;t walk
in Jessica&#39;s shoes but we can walk
together
