this is not about thinking outside of
the box this is about thinking inside
the box I was raised by lesbian wolves
in the heart of the Rocky Mountains and
I don&#39;t have any slides there we go I&#39;ll
show you those mountains where I came
from when I was eight years old I buried
a box in my backyard and inside that box
I put a fork a pen and a dollar bill I
thought that maybe aliens or future
versions of humans would find that box
in five hundred years and learn about
the way our species thought how we
exchanged our ideas maybe even how we
ate our food Here I am 30 years later
and I&#39;m still making boxes only now
they&#39;re see-through boxes like three
thousand pound microscope slides with
cut-up books magazines and drawings
trapped inside freezing the DNA of our
culture after dropping out of high
school and traveling the world
hitchhiking through New Zealand I ended
up in Asia and India all these weird
places
I met a renegade physicist who turned me
on to many new lineages of thought from
German 19th century romantics the likes
of Aldous Huxley and Pablo Naruto Naruto
I like Kudo of Naruto my my mind opened
like when Plato cave first felt that
light piercing it this amplified my ever
growing inclination as to the mysterious
interconnectedness of our species
and and the mysterious underpinnings of
our existence there&#39;s a weird kid in the
forest in Colorado I found many strange
things dead animals discarded
electronics rocks and sticks really
anything I could find years later I was
doing that in New York only now it was
called art at some point I was cutting
up a dictionary and I was making a grid
on a canvas for my mom I covered the
canvas in resin and Abby got stock she&#39;s
terribly allergic to bees and afraid of
them so I covered it in more resin
thinking I would hide it the opposite
happened I discovered an optical quality
the text was magnified this built me
this brought me to building these Joseph
Cornell like boxes with 3d collages and
objects I started to layer them in the
boxes all these things I was you know
finding in the streets at this point at
some point I started to draw around the
objects the way you might draw around a
dead body in the street I know you all
have done that all of a sudden I
realized I could draw on space
I could make floating drawings they
started to look like biological matter
dendrites molecular structures I was
just using a pen at some point I was
just drawing in cooking pans it was very
strange my OCD took over and I created
my own taxonomy of invented specimens
first with botanical matter then weird
drawn and painted insects with many legs
and wings at some point I talked to my
friends who are doctors and I borrowed
MRI datasets and I started layering them
up in the resin
finally I did the human form as a
drawing now this was good I finally
found a visual language I was making
money as an artist I could take my
girlfriend out to the lobster for dinner
 was getting good there was one
problem I was going to die the resin was
highly toxic and if I continued to use
it it would eventually kill me so I
switched to glass this was amazing all
of a sudden I could go backwards things
weren&#39;t stuck I could edit change my
mind build perspective I can almost
control time it was like making movies
but these movies didn&#39;t move
this brings me to what I&#39;ve been doing
for the last ten years one project is
called psycho geographies and I like to
think of it as a catalogue of humanity
as a composite of infinite interactions
between cultural adaptations and genetic
projections now what do I really mean by
that our biological DNA bends it curves
at mutated mutates not only through
mistakes in code but through epigenetic
and cultural influences
I&#39;ve spent seven years I think so far on
this project this one has two heads and
inside the chest there are mountains and
a jungle inside that jungle there is a
river and inside that river there are
Roman and Greek artifacts popping in and
out you might find your mother or your
father in there maybe a pet dog there&#39;s
a guy here and he&#39;s throwing pills into
one of the brains this is from the side
from the side they disappear
everything&#39;s gone this one is a
waterfall coming out of the stomach
there&#39;s a strange creature looking at
corn in the cob here&#39;s a woman talking
to a fish this is an old lady playing
guitar - some avocados here&#39;s a city in
the clouds
this guy&#39;s trapped forever in his box
this installation was very much inspired
by the terracotta warriors I&#39;m sure a
few of you have been there they&#39;re meant
to stay together as a group kind of like
this
another project I&#39;ve been working on is
very much inspired by this painting the
Garden of Earthly Delights do you all
know that painting by Hieronymus Bosch
in the Prado I hope so
I like it this piece is rather large
it&#39;s 18 feet long and it weighs 24,000
pounds I&#39;ll kind of walk you through it
it&#39;s hard I wish it was in my pocket on
the left side there&#39;s a cave and the
animal headed creatures are traveling
into this cave through a tunnel to the
back where they&#39;re hiding this is Jesus
and the locust this is the blood
fountain where all the creatures are
dancing this is where all those
creatures have descended from the
volcano into a mass exodus into the
ocean this is one of their bird gods
tied up to a battleship now this ocean
it&#39;s made of thousands of hidden
references Billy Graham is in there
Einstein is in there The Horizon from
the oil spill is hidden in there you&#39;ve
got Waldo in there for the kids and
Osama bin Laden&#39;s shelter for the adults
Bucky Fuller&#39;s domes floating off into
space on the right side of this work
there&#39;s a woman she&#39;s rising out of the
sea and she&#39;s spitting the darkness into
one hand she has clouds coming out of
her other hand and her hands are like
scales kind of like the earth and cosmos
and balance
when you go to the other side she turns
into an 18 foot long serpent she&#39;s
spitting clouds out of a Ganesh like
trunk and her tail undulates
through an analog mesh underworld
catching on fire at the back of the
volcano and terminating at a cycloptic
eyeball made out of 1986 terrorist cards
which were like baseball cards in the
1980s but you get them with a stick of
gum this is my latest box so instead of
making boxes out of glass and books
which I&#39;m still doing in fact they were
like the Boise and biscuits to fill to
feed this dancing giant social sculpture
what you&#39;re looking at it&#39;s called
pioneer works Center for art and
innovation and inside this box we don&#39;t
put drawn humans we put living humans
it&#39;s only been around forty four months
in 22 days since this box was born this
is how it looked it was an old ironworks
from the 1860s we had to put about a
hundred windows in it that was a sort of
parking lot full of trucks now it&#39;s a
garden where people can come together so
the idea with this box is to bring
people together it&#39;s a museum
but I like to think of it as a Museum of
process it&#39;s not about seeing work
finished it&#39;s about seeing work made and
getting made we have a residency program
where we give artists and scientists
space to work next to each other there&#39;s
a painter that was 3d printed we teach
analog photo processes the idea here is
not to get five painters in the same
room
we create new combinations we&#39;ve had a
geneticist working with a musician and
the pair came up with an algorithm for
printmaking
now that&#39;s emergence we&#39;ve had an expert
and circuitry work with a sculptor and
the two came up with sculptures that
were moving using sensors we have a
recording studio
this young man is learning how to play
the theremin have any of you tried that
radio waves magnetic in our science lab
we&#39;re looking at things at a nano scale
and creating three-dimensional
environments at a nano scale to look at
through an oculus we&#39;re also creating
new imaging tests for cervical cancer in
places like sub-saharan Africa these are
just a few things that happen inside of
this strange box we have a radio station
and we print books and magazines so that
what happens here stays it can be
disseminated and be given away to the
people that are not inside this box with
us in tribal culture there was a
community Hut much like this one it&#39;s a
place where people came together to ask
their questions to resolve their
problems to seek camaraderie form
community maybe even make something
together pioneer works is a 21st century
Hut now I&#39;m an optimist as you can maybe
tell and I&#39;m blown away and my mind is
completely blown clearly by the things
that this species can do and how we can
adapt by segregating art from science
physics from music biology from
architecture or whatever example you
like we are seriously inhibiting the
alchemy of wonder and invention so
here&#39;s the thing my box started small
around a canvas it grew to contain a
person and now that box extends to a
community by pushing back the boundaries
of
eugen whether physical social or
cultural we are watching synthesis in
action and it&#39;s nothing short of bananas
thank you very much
