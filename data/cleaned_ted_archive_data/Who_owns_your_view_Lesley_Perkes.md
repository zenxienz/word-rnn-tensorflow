I&#39;m only kidding
I was born here at the Florence
Nightingale Hospital in a city Joburg
Hillbrow 1961 when I came out of my
mother she says I looked like a toilet
brush my hair was standing on end I
think I saw the future 1968 the
apartheid government paused
269 meters of cold concrete power right
into the middle of Hill burrows flatland
reduce those days Hillbrow is 80 percent
why it&#39;s mostly immigrant refugees from
all over Europe we have cafe dears and
cafe dirt it is called very continental
my friend Herbie was a little boy then
like me and he lived in the flat
opposite he says he watched them build
it 24 hours a day for two years until he
says it stole the sky who owns your view
in those days if you were white and you
had 20 cents you could go up the
high-speed lift all the way to the top
to this very fancy restaurant called
Hendricks where you could be wined and
dined and the restaurant revolved so
that you could see the view who owns
your view in the late 80s during one of
many states of emergency when they were
bombs going off in the dust burns into a
work the apartheid government declared
the building insecure and
piece of legislation known as the
national keypoints act and in a
shadowdog no matter which race you were
running in couldn&#39;t go in the other day
2013 the building remains closed under
the same draconian law that&#39;s me I&#39;m
knocking at the door knock knock
knocking at the door
looking at the wall not alone looking at
the wall
in those days this was probably the
blacks only entrance today it&#39;s the only
working entrance but it still hasn&#39;t
worked for me or anyone that I know
the preoccupations of the powerful
prophets in the streets the
preoccupations in the corridors of power
the Hobart hours are publicly owned
building today Hillbrow is 80% black and
it&#39;s seriously continental Africa
Eritrea Ethiopia Senegal the car Congo
our whole future depends on this place
you have places just like this we all
have places just like this no I&#39;m not
showing you our tree-lined roads are
beautiful suburbs or our grand colonial
buildings I&#39;m showing you the face of a
child who lives in Johannesburg on top
of her flats and who wonders where is
wonder where&#39;s our wonder the other day
I heard a brilliant academic and writer
and my country by the name of Herschel
and bombero conference and he says we
have a crisis of imagination unless we
do something about it we&#39;re doomed to
repeat ourselves
he&#39;ll browse rich with beautiful people
a lot of unemployed people
I used to live here this was the first
house that I moved into and I left
school when I was 17 years old but that
was before it was a wank I am in a bank
considered a no-go zone for anyone with
anything to lose
there&#39;s a famous mutual fund empire
builder by the name of John Templeton
who I&#39;m sure some of you mutual fund
Empire builders must know or have heard
of and he said look for the points of
maximum pessimism and invest there well
I am and me and my friends are we work
in neighborhoods ain&#39;t no dad-burned too
scary for us this is the project Chris
was telling you about
in inner-city charvak you know every now
and then they stopped asking us to fill
in forms and go to meetings and they
throw money at us because it&#39;s the World
Cup and we have to look like we&#39;re
always cooking here and they give us a
fortune so when they do we get very
lucky we do this beautiful project with
local artist Mary Sue bandy who actually
lives in that building and verse these
are some images of her exhibition called
long live the date Queen which is about
servitude and the dreams of ordinary
people which we put up on 10,000 square
meters of inner city space that is
normally reserved for advertising here
it&#39;s a pile of rubble next to my house I
didn&#39;t notice it for over a year I kept
driving past it
my friend Johanna after I asked him
brought me that drawing sorry I&#39;m going
back to see this amazing drawing see it
would you have given me permission to
say yes her it wasn&#39;t your money I had a
little bit of money in my pocket from
that World Cup I said yes we made the
Troya bedtime story with her friends and
on
in also an area of the inner city known
as trival people come there all the time
to have their pictures taken some of
them dress up specially some of them
come just as they are the story
continues and you can read about it
online the story manifests in physical
space as well as on the Internet&#39;s back
in Hillbrow full of entrepreneurs this
is George and Co see you can go and be
coached by him at 7 o&#39;clock in the
morning and he&#39;ll bra
people do I&#39;m so happy we are not our
governments Fela Kuti says we are all
Nigerian it stands to reason then even
though it&#39;s probably the most
politically incorrect thing that I could
say to you today from where I come from
that we are all Americans as well and it
therefore stands to reason that you were
born in Hillbrow and that you are my
kindred spirits should you choose for 20
years I have loved this presentation
around from door to door to say let&#39;s
use the Hillbrow as a canvas for public
arts let&#39;s use imagination to reinvent
our city who work with the neighborhood
and do a nine city blop blup upgrade
around the base of the tower and for
years I have hit my head on a face brick
wall of forms to fill in and people
who&#39;ve said I&#39;m mad
a month ago I took the proposal to a
woman by the name of Sharon Lewis at the
johannesburg development agency fully
expecting to be told only such a
romantic who&#39;s such an idealist Cain
slew Abel you know what happens when you
have good ideas and she said this is
incredible we have to do this I swear
nearly asked if she was mad the
residence and we&#39;re doing it
and two weeks ago we sat down and did
the budget for the inner city upgrade
around the base of the tower which i
think is the hardest money to raise and
a week later she told me she has the
budget ring fenced so I&#39;m here to say to
you usually you get a Teddy to comfort
you but not in the streets of Hell braum
and not in a lot of the streets that you
see around maybe and that you don&#39;t
notice help us help us to clean this
Teddy helped us to fix the sick baby
thank you
[Applause]
