these images show the collapse of the
Larsen B Ice Shelf in Antarctica in 2002
this event though is just one of many
that I could show you that capture the
the and document the retreating glaciers
worldwide due to our changing climate
these images though tell you the story
through one perspective a visually
striking but silent one and what I want
to do today is tell you the story
through a completely different
perspective through sound this is the
sound of glacier ice melting in the
ocean
in telling you the story through sound
though I need to tell you a little bit
about glaciers along the way glaciers
are far from passive lumps of ice on our
landscape they are constantly flowing
and cracking growing and melting even in
a stable climate they are actually more
like rivers of ice on our landscape than
than passive lumps and as rivers of ice
an event like the Larsen B collapse is
like the breaking of a dam the glaciers
upstream will accelerate 2 to 3 4 times
their normal speed that ice gets
funneled directly into the ocean and
raises sea level this is the crane
glacier which used to flow into the
Larsen B Ice Shelf it now is throwing it
flowing at three times its speed its
retreating up Valley and it&#39;s shrinking
and it&#39;ll keep doing this for another
decade maybe more we don&#39;t know until it
reaches some new equilibrium each of
these events though is hard to predict
they&#39;re like earthquakes in that sense
but what we can do is look for the
emerging weaknesses and understand the
underlying processes and triggers so
that we can start to foresee some of
these rapid changes that are leading to
rapid increases in sea level rise the
challenge though is that all of this
action is happening at this boundary
where the glaciers tumble into the ocean
the ice ocean boundary which is the most
dangerous part of a glacier to work in
we risk our lives if we want to go up
there to collect any direct measurements
the satellite imagery is great because
it&#39;s been it&#39;s been allowing us to view
these areas from a distance from above
but we can learn so much more if we also
listen from below the water surface this
is the sound of glacier ice melting in a
laboratory tank
and when these combined together we get
back that hiss that you heard earlier
most visitors to glacial fjords will
recognize and notice the sizzling sound
of icebergs melting around their boat
but while this sound is barely audible
through the air it creates a deafening
hiss under the water this is because
water transmits sound much better than
air it&#39;s like when you put your ear to
the steel rail of a train track in order
to hear a distant train coming by
listening under the water we can
actually hear much more clearly that
melting sound of the ice which which
foretells the sea level is rising
glacierized fjords are the loudest
natural ocean environment that we&#39;ve
measured so far the sizzling of ice melt
is just one of the really loud sounds
there but as you just heard there other
sounds as well that was a calving event
which is the birth of an iceberg but we
can also hear rainfall and wave action
we can hear cracking and the rubbing of
the ice against the rock walls we can
hear the gushing of water as it flushes
out from underneath the glaciers and
rises to the surface and of course we
can hear the biological sounds of seals
whales and other animals these sounds
are much louder and much more richly
textured under the water surface than
they are in the air they also contain a
lot more information and this is
information that we want to use to try
to understand these these this this
boundary where the ice meets the ocean
for me that sizzling sound is the most
intriguing because of its direct
relationship with the ice melting the
sizzling is caused by air getting
trapped in pockets in the ice as the
snow gets compressed into ice high up in
the mountains these millions of tiny air
pockets are the air is trapped in these
millions of tiny air pockets in a
process that takes years two centuries
depending on the glacier as these air
pockets after these air pockets get
trapped though they flow with the ice
through the glacier they get pressurized
by going hundreds to thousands of feet
below the surface before they tumble out
into the ocean as icebergs and this
shows what these air pockets look like
up close against the backdrop of
crystal-clear glacier ice each one of
these is about the size of a sesame seed
and these are the same air pockets that
we use to study climate history through
ice cores in fact this particular image
the air contained in the pockets shown
here we&#39;re from the same atmosphere that
allowed the in
Joan of Arc to breathe her first breath
in 1412 - within a year - if we no hold
on because these air pockets are about
all the same size they&#39;re also
distributed relatively evenly throughout
the glacier and now they&#39;re all
pressurized because they&#39;ve flown
they&#39;ve gone with the glacier all the
way through when they melt out in the
ocean they melt out within a relatively
narrow range of frequencies or musical
tones they mostly melt out within the
upper third of the piano keyboard
centered somewhere around hi-c just to
give you a little reference there the
exact frequency range and tones that are
that a particular iceberg will produce
depends a little bit on the glacier but
because we know what one of these bubble
sounds like are a few from our
laboratory experiments we can estimate
what the melting of thousands to
millions to billions of them sound like
so we can use the sound the loudness of
the sound in order to measure that
process of ice melting when the sound
gets louder there&#39;s more ice melting
when the sound gets quieter there&#39;s less
ice melting and over the course of time
through days and weeks and over a year
there is some natural variability in
what is going to be happening in a go in
a glacial fjord at this ice ocean
boundary but we can also hear events
like when a warm ocean current comes in
if this unusual event comes in and
starts to melt out the glacier from
underneath ultimately we can also sorry
we can also use the cracking and
fracturing of the ice the calving events
to also keep track of as the glaciers
move is Chi is losing mass and and
retreating back perhaps signaling one of
these collapse events might be happening
ultimately will wane on what we want to
do is be able to use the sound to
understand and listen for these
invisible processes that are telling us
that our cause
these invisible changes that are
happening at this really critical
boundary in our that that leads to
ultimately sea-level rise we can make
these measurements simply by lowering a
hydrophone which is an underwater
microphone over the side of a kayak
while we&#39;re out enjoying a day in a
fewer and this is this is great it gives
us a lot of information but we really
want to know is what&#39;s happening over
longer times over days weeks and months
and even years and in that case we need
to go to a larger research vessel there
and we need to deploy these hydrophones
on moorings where they&#39;re anchored to
the bottom of the ocean and suspended
suspended in the water with a float we
right now have four of these that have
been deployed in western Greenland over
the last year and we&#39;re going to recover
those in another month or two
we have one that&#39;s been deployed in the
Antarctic for two years now we&#39;re not
sure if we&#39;re gonna get that one back
it&#39;s stuck under thick sea ice right now
but it has amazing data set on it and I
hope we get back and we want but we want
to deploy more of these because the more
we understand and can capture these
soundscapes this underwater soundscape
the more that we can use that to help us
document and foresee these changes that
are happening that are happening way too
rapidly as a human as a person I want to
stay safely back from this ice ocean
boundary in taking my measurements but
as a scientist I actually want to push
the intellectual boundaries to help us
understand what&#39;s happening with the ice
what&#39;s happening with sea level rise and
ask the hard questions and come up with
creative ways to answer them because
right now the question is not if sea
level is rising the question is by how
much and how soon the glaciers are
trying to tell us something
isn&#39;t it time we listened
