take my hand let&#39;s go for a walk I want
to tell you a story a story about a city
that is yet to be a city that needs you
to be real she needs me to be real this
is a city where each of your talents and
ambitions can change the course of how
we exist storytelling is a universal
language surviving generations centuries
millennia surviving disease and famine
death and destruction wars and conflict
slavery and oppression it survives
through our voice and through our
hearing our voice and hearing carries us
through times of great powerlessness
these stories give an indelible atita
our experiences this universal language
of storytelling comes alive in Africa
perhaps more so today&#39;s than any other
time an African terrible about why human
beings have two ears that only one mouth
is a testament but in Africa listening
is the guiding principle this principle
is lost to us in the constant chatter of
the Western world we speak much and hear
very little if we are to learn from
history and believe that storytelling is
an indiscriminate vehicle for the pages
of history then listening must be our
guiding principle as I shared earlier I
stand here before you today to tell you
a story a story about how a people&#39;s
unfortunate past command the future of
prosperity opportunity and
self-determination and this future is
our future city this is a city I&#39;ve been
dreaming about my entire career and now
have this great opportunity to fulfill
this tree
came within the next five years in free
state south africa i want to tell you
this story because I am an urban planner
and this is the most exciting Commission
I&#39;ve ever had and because I believe
there&#39;s a place for you each of you in
the design of this city a city for the
future what I want to tell you this
story not through my eyes I want to tell
it to you through her eyes it is said
that there are only two or three human
stories that go on repeating themselves
fiercely as though they&#39;ve never
happened before her story her history is
not unique what is unique is this great
opportunity to rewrite and be a part of
rewriting her future she is a girl of
free states south africa she is someone
with dreams and hopes and she hopes that
what you will hear today will be your
guiding principle to help rewrite her
future to understand why a city of being
envisioned today in free state why now I
need to take you back just a little bit
free state is a province at the heart of
South Africa its people tell the nation
story its landscape is breathtaking it&#39;s
rich story starts at the beginning of
time today I share with you a history
that is relevant to her today between
nine to eighteen ninety nine and 1902
the second anglo-boer war led to the
birth of what we know today as the ANC
the African National Congress our girl
witnessed natural resources depleted
from her province now for her prosperity
or the prosperity of her family but for
others she witnessed men separated from
their mothers their wives their families
their children to work in mines not for
her prosperity but for others leaders
such as Mandela gave everything to
fulfill her dream to return the stolen
harvest to her children and one
they her children&#39;s children two years
ago the provincial government asked me
to join a team of individuals to be a
part of fulfilling this extraordinary
dream her dream Mandela&#39;s dream through
a new city that they call a city for
tomorrow emboldened by Mandela&#39;s
sacrifice and strengthened by his
resolve for free and prosperous Africa
for South Africa the provincial
government assembled our team together
and asked us to design a new global
dynamic city to one that would grow to a
population of over a half a million
people a green city it must be no cars
allowed in the center just walk waves it
should be designed to appeal to a young
generation a generation that doesn&#39;t
find hope in free state today a place
that celebrates health education and
economic opportunity in short this could
be a fantastic leapfrog project using
all that we&#39;ve learned in recent decades
to build a beautiful beautiful modern
city from a blank canvas and all of you
in here who worked on City making that&#39;s
all we ever want really is a blank
canvas to do it right so what is so
compelling about this why now why Free
State because of him and many others
like him the college educated youth are
leaving free state and there is an
exodus it&#39;s a brain drain they recognize
this they know that he sees no future
there if he is educated and so in order
to stop this brain drain our team was
tasked to design a city and eventually
build one that will allow him his
children and his children&#39;s children to
prosper I know what&#39;s running through
your mind right now we&#39;ve heard this
before many nations have tried many
nations have failed politicians promise
and promises are broken even our young
boy wonders he wonders what is my future
when my past is so wretched what do i
inherit after centuries of subjugation
he tells himself I know this earth knows
my name but she has not called me for
lifetimes what do i inherit from that
history I don&#39;t blame him but I know
that this vision can be realized I know
this because I have witnessed the
provincial government the elected
leadership taking bold steps in order so
that this vision can be realized for him
they have identified 17 thousand
hectares of Greenfield they have
designated that this new city will not
be attached to an existing municipality
or an existing city but it will not be
shackled by existing ways of thinking or
existing culture that it will not
surrender itself as a second city to any
other city I know that this vision takes
such bold steps and that political will
can go of long way they know that a
fresh start is necessary they&#39;ve asked
us to design a city that incorporates
the technologies we know of today and
the one that&#39;s just around the corner
and this is how it will happen with a
commitment and political will off we
went we joined them in this dream to
incorporate all of the best ideas of
architecture urban planning
state-of-the-art transportation
environmentalism and for me personally
it became this amazing chance to put
into plant all things learned in urban
planning and so we designed a city the
first phase of a master plan for 6000
residential units we start with a
circular footprint the shape of the
master plan reflects the rising front
time and time again residents citizens
talk to us about how it&#39;s their time for
a new day they&#39;re waiting for the Sun to
rise over their history and so this
circular footprint and bodies that
vision a new day the Rising Sun for the
people of free
it also as architects would know those
of us it allows for efficiency and
redundancy if we imagine a city designed
for her citizens our city our first
phase is the small circle you see
comparing itself to larger cities such
as Paris Durban cape town we start with
our small inner circle a circle of
residents about 18,000 with 6000 units
imagine this city that provides the
healthiest most sustainable environment
for our students for our residents a
city that secures the quality of life a
seven minute walk from anywhere to
anywhere and why is this possible and
why now and why would we do this how
would we do this this is how this city
has to work for him and for her we have
to make this work their government knows
that free state is truly at a crossroads
the youth is leaving for opportunities
elsewhere mining is winding down the
jobs are not there people literally pass
through free state it is a true exodus
they know they have to make it for her
there is an urgency to stop this
bleeding and a sense of helplessness for
a better future so what will a day do
you like for these children in their new
city these children will find themselves
being able to walk to school they&#39;ll
find that their parents can walk to work
they&#39;ll find that when their parents
come home they&#39;re not exhausted by city
living they&#39;re not exhausted by their
commute they can navigate their entire
day easily they can attend their central
park they can go through it walking
districts at the core they can take the
right light rail and they&#39;re a smaller
block so that they can get to all of
their needs by foot and there&#39;s an urban
center and all their resources are close
by they can integrate themselves into
the central park open space and
celebrate living outdoors and that is
what cities are about celebrating living
outdoors they all have spaces where the
verb of humanity can come to life and
they&#39;ll have all of
they&#39;re city resources close by so again
their parents will not be exhausted from
commutes too long places to pay the
bills don&#39;t have options for travel
beyond what they wish to walk to they
can take the monorail if they wish and
they can borrow a bike to get about all
services within walking or riding
distances they may tend their family
garden in their community plot so that
they can have fresher foods available to
them they can find their way to shops
and services using the pedestrian
walkways or the arcade this city has to
be real for them it has to work for them
and it will they have the commitment and
the political will of their leaders they
have the passion from us to be a part of
this dream to put all that we have
learned into practice this city of the
future will happen it needs a global
community to cheer for it it needs you
to stand up and applaud for it it needs
you to contribute to it it needs you to
rewrite their future the government of
Free State knows we are here today
presenting their bold vision and master
plan for the city of the future they
would love for the ingenuity that fills
this room today to be a part of this
dream this city is calling from the
future saying dream about me design me
make me happen I am a small part of this
you are a big part of this as the Sun
rises over the past a free state casting
a brilliant light on its path on its
future this city of the future calls on
you to see it through will you dream
with me will you build with me will you
make this city of the future real with
me come
you
