[Applause]
I&#39;m just gonna stand here for a moment
as my own standing ovation to all the
women who&#39;ve come before me and those
who will follow and I mean that
literally and spiritually I&#39;m in all of
you all but let me tell you a little bit
about what I mean at about the age of 10
I gave up on Sleeping Beauty and
Cinderella and started reading
biographies the ones I liked best were
the stories of women like Jane Addams
Florence Nightingale Eleanor Roosevelt I
didn&#39;t think of them then as social
entrepreneurs but that&#39;s what they were
they were women who never saw a problem
that they didn&#39;t think could be soft
course I was also reading Nancy Drew
another great problem solver
I bet lots of you were too they
understood that ministering to the
suffering and the afflicted was nice but
insufficient to really make a difference
you had to attack the conditions that
had brought about that suffering and
misery in the first place and best of
all they weren&#39;t terribly beautiful but
they were smart competent and courageous
Jane Addams brought social work to the
u.s. with Hull House which she built
with her friend Ellen star in the slums
of Chicago at the end of the 19th
century but she did much more than that
every progressive movement you can think
of suffrage civil rights immigrant
rights children&#39;s rights pacifism had
Jane Addams fingerprints all over it and
although she looks kind of a dour sort
she actually was a huge fan of play she
built playgrounds in the Hull House
complex and she became an advocate for
playgrounds in public spaces all over
the country most of us think of Florence
Nightingale as that
with the lamp who brought the profession
of modern nursing to the US and to
England what you may not know is that
she was a fiend for statistics even one
of the first women to use the pie chart
so it was when she returned to England
from the Crimea and dug into the data
that she realized more soldiers were
dying of typhus and cholera and
dysentery than from their battle wounds
and that&#39;s what led to her breakthrough
that hygiene and sanitation were the key
to saving lives unlike those wonderful
first ladies we saw last night Eleanor
Roosevelt wasn&#39;t crazy about the role so
she made sure that kettle of boiling
water was always at hand she was one of
the founders of the UN she chaired the
committee that drafted the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and she
co-founded Freedom House which continues
to monitor the progress and the fits and
starts of democracy all over the world
in my opinion she would have made one
heck of a president today I don&#39;t have
to read about women who lived fifty or
hundred years ago to be inspired I work
at the skull foundation with one of the
most creative and committed
philanthropists of our time Jeff Skoll a
guy who also believes in the power of
stories to shape who we are what we care
about and what we choose to do with what
we care about my wonderful colleagues
and I at the skull foundation seek out
and then we invest in connect and
celebrate the men and women who have
made changing the world their life&#39;s
work I&#39;d like to tell you about just a
couple of them
Cecilia Flores the Bandhu grew up in the
slums of the Philippines the second
oldest of 12 children she went to work
at the age of five selling fish and
scavenging garbage
I can still feel the warm drippings down
my face from the basket of fish I
carried on my head she told me I can
still smell the stench of the garbage in
my clothes in on my skin that&#39;s who I am
that&#39;s my history against powerful odds
Cecilia made it to high school and then
to college where she became an activist
she joined the Maoist rebellion against
the Marcos dictatorship in 1982 she and
her husband were imprisoned they were
held for four years two of her children
were actually born in in captivity but
when the Freedom for what for which she
had fought was finally achieved and she
was released she dedicated her life to
securing freedom for whom for those whom
the fledgling state could not yet
protect victims of human trafficking so
how would a Maoist rebel bred in the
slums attack the very ugly and very big
business of human trafficking by
thinking the system through
that&#39;s how Cecilia understood again you
have to get to the enabling conditions
so she&#39;s reached out to the port&#39;s the
airport&#39;s the shipping companies the
container companies the bus companies
she&#39;s made human trafficking everyone&#39;s
problem and so she&#39;s helped make it
everyone&#39;s solution ports and the
Philippines that were once safe harbors
for human traffickers are today
becoming havens of hope for victims from
the Philippines of today we go back in
time and space to South Wales coal
country where an Cotton&#39;s grandmother
left school at the age of 12 after her
father was injured in a coal mining
accident this made anne&#39;s grandmother a
fierce advocate for for education
understanding that education was the way
out of a life of exploitation and danger
so that when an won a scholarship to the
best school the best private school in
the region at the age of 11 she
understood the
opportunity she&#39;d been afforded at the
same time even at that age she firmly
rejected any correlation between wealth
and human value years later she found
herself in Zimbabwe she was carrying out
research designed to uncover the
cultural reasons so a few girls were
enrolled in education what she
confronted instead was the stark reality
it&#39;s poverty and not culture that&#39;s
responsible she returned home to
Cambridge England and launched Camfed
the campaign for female education not
with a grand strategic plan but with a
bake sale now I find this all the more
remarkable Fiona you&#39;ll agree because I
know Anne come and she&#39;s no Baker but
from that bake sale from those cheapest
skits and cakes came an organisation
that today has provided educational
opportunity for more than a million
girls in sub-saharan Africa you know the
data there is nothing absolutely nothing
that makes as much of a difference to so
many every place in the world as an
investment in girls education but Camfed
isn&#39;t just any bleeding-heart campaign
Camfed Anne&#39;s approach turns noblesse
oblige on its head it puts the girl
client at the center of a power
structure made up of locally fully
empowered committees working at the
district the regional and the national
level it&#39;s a governance system that is
all about accountability the only
accountability that matters to that girl
for her education and for her protection
so that she can go just as far as she
wants every Zambian kwacha every
Zimbabwean dollar every British pound
that flows through Camfed can be tracked
and traced to that girl client two years
after that first bake sale
Zimbabwe was able to announce to the 21
districts in the country that
scholarships would be available for
top-scoring
applicants one of those applicants was
runner ro ma Shan Godsey here&#39;s what she
wrote I used to go to school barefooted
my face full of hunger if only I get the
chance I will do something great today
runner ro is a pediatrician practicing
in Namibia and there&#39;s no question she&#39;s
doing something great if I had the
chance I would tell you many many more
stories about women like Cecilia and Ann
and Elizabeth and Jacqueline and Sakina
and Mabel and so many of the wonderful
people in this room women who paved the
way to change women&#39;s social
entrepreneurs women who understand that
it&#39;s not what you do it&#39;s how you do it
they understand it&#39;s not how big you are
how big your budget is how large your
organization is it&#39;s how big a
difference you can make who understand
it&#39;s not about being dominant in any
space or place it&#39;s about crossing
boundaries to forge the connections you
need to get the job done it&#39;s not how
powerful you are it&#39;s about how truly
and honestly you empower others it&#39;s
been 50 years since I put down sleeping
beauty since I woke to discover the
power of real women and their stories
women making change in the world today I
can imagine my little granddaughter
who&#39;s just taken her first steps
striding into the life that she&#39;s meant
to lead the life that will draw
inspirations from the heroines of our
time the women and men who were building
a better world
for her women and men who understand
that who they are says everything about
how they do the work they do that who
they are and how they do it are more
important than what they do and why they
do it women who summon the heroine we
are in a time that needs heroines we
need heroes we need heroines but we can
summon this in each of us Joseph
Campbell said it best heroism is a
matter of integrity becoming more and
more at each step ourselves thank you
