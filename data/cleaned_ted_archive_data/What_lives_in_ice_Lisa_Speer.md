what do you think about when you think
about ice is it the stuff that keeps
your drink cool and a hot summer
afternoon or that special silky
smoothness that comes to an ice rink
after it&#39;s been Zamboni
or maybe it&#39;s the stuff that trips you
up in January after a snowstorm in New
York City those were all the things that
I thought about when I thought about ice
until a trip to the Arctic completely
upended my understanding of ice of
wilderness and the amazing complexity of
our planet when you look out at sea ice
it looks vast it looks forbidding it
looks empty
yet there&#39;s so much more to understand
about ice in the Arctic it&#39;s far more
than frozen water this chart this piece
of ice demonstrates the point in all
those little nooks and crannies you can
see tunnels and channels formed between
ice crystals and among ice crystals
things live in those channels things
lots of things live in those channels in
fact scientists have documented over a
thousand species of plants and animals
that live in on or under the ice each
exquisitely adapted to a particular
place in the ice you have algae that
grows only on top of the ice this stuff
smells and tastes like watermelon but
unless you want to have a speed date
with your toilet I advise you not to eat
it there&#39;s algae that grows only under
the ice and in some cases in these
amazing curtains although this is much
less common now as ocean chemistry has
changed there are many other creatures
that live in the ice little tiny worms
snails bacteria and that these plus the
algae are harvested by this gorgeous and
firoozeh and it&#39;s an amphipod
as well as copepods and other larger
animals which in turn supports larger
species including the polar cod which is
my personal favorite this guy&#39;s blood
chemistry resembles that of antifreeze
and it enables them to live in
temperatures below zero
he&#39;s nestled into a little nook or
cranny in the ice protected from
predators and surrounded by dinner in
the form of anthropods and copepods what
more could a fish ask for but maybe a
female fish polar Cod intern is
dependent upon by a whole range of
animals including Narwhal the derivation
of the word Narwhal is amazing that in
Old Norse gnar means corpse wall means
whale corpse whale and they named it
that because when these animals are
underwater that grayish modelling makes
them look like drown sailors that
protrude rince coming out of its head
looks like a horn but it&#39;s not it&#39;s a
tooth and unlike our teeth it has a
whole range of neurons and receptors
that allow it to determine what&#39;s in its
environment scientists have debated for
years what decades centuries what
possible use could an animal have with
an appendage like that some people think
it stirs up the ocean bottom and causes
fish to come out others think it&#39;s a way
of measuring the thickness of ice so
that they can find air quickly this
animal is just an one example of many
others that depend on polar cod there
are a suite of seals that maybe half
dozen of them that rely on sea ice
either completely or partially for
different stages of their lifecycle this
harp seal is nursing its pup and polar
cod are very nutritious and important
for these moms as their
I&#39;m pregnant and giving birth polar cod
are kind of like the energy bar of the
ocean and they provide a lot of needed
nutrition birds also feed on polar cod
these mirrors will sit on the ice dive
in pick up fish come back give it to
their young the ice
both provides food but it also serves
other functions in the Arctic it&#39;s a
platform from which animals can hunt for
their prey so this polar bear will be
can roam around the ice looking for
seals it&#39;s much more efficient for him
to walk on ice than it is to swim in the
water and there that&#39;s why ice is
important as a platform from which to
feed these wall wrists similarly feed
from their ice platforms they mate and
breed and bear their young on ice they
eat by valves and clams similar
organisms that occur along the ocean
bottom in shallow water so we are all
everyone in this room knows we are
losing sea ice at a dramatic pace this
map is taken if this map shows the earth
as if you were sitting on top of it so
you have Russia here Norway in Sweden
Iceland Greenland Canada in the United
States the red line illustrates the sea
ice minimum that was the median of the
sea ice minimum from 1979 to the year
2000 the white part shows the extent of
sea ice minimum in 2012 so you can see
it has shrunk very dramatically it&#39;s not
only shrinking an extent but it&#39;s
shrinking in depth and the volume of sea
ice has declined by almost two-thirds in
the last three decades so for the
animals that rely on the ice the
seabirds the seals polar bears the
future is not looking terribly good
as we lose ice we start to lose species
and you get the picture the Arctic Ocean
will be devoid of summer sea ice within
our lifetimes and even more depressing
news is that even if we stopped emitting
co2 tomorrow the warmth already in the
system will continue to move it will
continue to melt the ice so it&#39;s now
what do you think when you think of ice
bummer right hopeless right no I am here
to tell you there are things that we can
and we indeed we must do to protect this
incredible part of the planet we need to
protect key ecosystems from the damage
by industrial activities like fishing
from oil and gas development which not
only involves major spills potentially
but also generates massive amounts of
waste that&#39;s typically dumped over the
side untreated along with air pollution
and water and noise pollution noise
pollution in the Arctic is really a
problem because the animals there find
each other and communicate with sound
not with vision a noisy ocean makes it
that much harder for animals to
communicate together shipping across the
top of the Arctic shapes 5,000 miles off
the trip from Asia to Europe and we&#39;ve
already seen a huge growth in transit
Arctic shipping shipping can bring with
it the risk of ship strikes against
whales invasive species and of course
the chance for a major accident which we
are singularly ill-equipped to deal with
so what is it that we can do to help
this region survive there are two big
things the first is reducing co2
emissions and I say that because even
though the warmth already in this in the
system will continue to melt the ice the
lower the co2 the slower the melting
will have
and time is everything for creatures
that need to adapt to a tremendously
changing environment the second reason
we need to curb co2 emissions is that
co2 dissolves in seawater and creates
carbonic acid this phenomenon happens
much more quickly in the Arctic than it
does in almost any other part of the
world because co2 dissolves more readily
in cold water than it does in warm water
that&#39;s why your coke it is bubbly or
when it&#39;s cold than it is when it&#39;s warm
so reducing co2 emissions it&#39;s a
critical first first step a second key
step is protecting habitat diversity
throughout the Arctic in habitat
diversity there is hope there are many
as many options as possible for
creatures to adapt their life cycles to
a new and changing Arctic a couple of
examples of these kinds of habitats this
is the Bering Strait a 50 mile wide gap
between the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic
Ocean every spring and every fall this
place turns into an underwater Serengeti
hundreds of thousands of marine mammals
and birds funnel up through this gap to
the Arctic to do their breeding and
birthing thing then in the fall they
come right back down through to
overwinter in the Pacific Ocean this is
the only place where they can get
through and it&#39;s a migration of global
significance and nobody knows about it
take another place Franz Josef land off
of Russia an archipelago that is forms a
barrier between the barents sea and the
Arctic Ocean and the mixing and currents
there keep the ice away from parts of
the island archipelago and open water is
really important for species that spend
their entire lives in the Arctic as
opposed to migrating
or the white see where this benthos is
just extraordinary it looks like
something we might see out here today
the White Sea has incredible number of
benthic habitats that are really
spectacular or the waters between
Greenland and Canada
Lancaster Sound Disko Bay the north
water polina it&#39;s a haven for a whole
range of marine mammals including beluga
whales and Narwhal and as well as a lot
of seabirds so I want to say this again
because it&#39;s important the first thing
we need to do is reduce co2 emissions
but that&#39;s not enough we have to help
this region to the maximum extent we can
maintain a diversity of habitats by
protecting them from harmful industrial
activities by now I hope that when you
next encounter ice perhaps in your drink
this evening you will think about the
Arctic and think about the opportunity
he has this small window to get in and
protect key habitats to maximize the
opportunity for species to survive over
time this picture was taken a month ago
this is our fearless leader Sylvia Earle
I tried to think about what was going
through her mind when this picture was
taken and all I could think of was this
joyful exuberant exuberance urging us
exhorting us to do whatever we can to
save this amazing part of the planet
thank you
