look for the person to your left now
look to the person to your right one of
you three will likely get Alzheimer&#39;s
disease by the time you&#39;re 80 it&#39;ll
start with dementia all right we&#39;ll
start with memory loss and we&#39;ll proceed
to dementia and eventually death this is
a catastrophe it&#39;s going to affect our
health care system for the next few
decades and more importantly it&#39;s going
to rob us of those that we care about we
need to find new ways to address this
disease a new creative ways to figure
out how to stop it so my lab is a nice s
research laboratory is trying to use
stem cell biology in a unique way to try
to address this disease but Alzheimer&#39;s
is actually probably many diseases like
cancer each of these types may have
different molecular root causes the root
cause of my Alzheimer&#39;s or my dimension
may be very different from your dementia
and therefore the drugs that we use to
treat them if one works for me it may
not work for you so we need to come up
with personalized therapies that can
treat each type of these images so
currently a physician knows if there&#39;s
basically two ways that a physician
knows whether or not you have
Alzheimer&#39;s disease in the first case
there are small number of cases where a
single gene mutation guarantees that you
can get the disease and usually by your
mid-40s but in the vast majority of
cases those of us to get it in our 60s
70s and 80s a pathologist has to wait
until autopsy and noted to understand
whether or not you just have initally
had Alzheimer&#39;s or a different type of
dementia so and the disease actually
probably starts up to 25 years before
you show clinical signs of dimensions to
go doctor
trying to go back for example a
pathologist would look for things like
amyloid plaques the tangles that arise
inside the neurons in the brain reduced
brain volume all of these are physical
manifestations of the disease there are
imaging technologies that are available
today that allow us to track the
progress of the disease but usually very
late in the disease process compared to
this 25 years from this from the start
this has been a major limitation for us
understanding how to actually understand
the beginning of the disease and
currently there are no drugs that are
approved to treat Alzheimer&#39;s disease or
actually prevent it and we&#39;re still left
to wonder what went wrong but to be sure
we&#39;ve we&#39;ve understood about a lot about
the end of this disease we&#39;re trying to
understand this beginning or how your
cells are actually experiencing the
disease has been very difficult and we
can&#39;t go into the brain of a living
Alzheimer&#39;s patient and ask for their
living brain tissue in order to set it
and study it in the lab we need to find
a better way to get access to this to
this disease in the lab so the
scientists interested in studying
Alzheimer&#39;s and then finding a cure for
Alzheimer&#39;s I want to understand the
beginning and how it progresses to the
end but it&#39;s a stencil biologist I also
have access to using I&#39;ll have the
opportunity to use living human cells I
have the opportunity to in the lab study
how these cells develop how they
progress from healthy into the disease
state and I can do this in the
laboratory this is critical for us under
start rying to find the earliest
possible point to treat this disease so
for example using a Nobel Prize winning
technology we can take adult human cells
and turn back the clock and recreate
stem cells from themselves and these
cells have the property of pluripotency
meaning they can develop into any cell
type of the body so heart tissue
Brighton tissue the beta cells of the
pancreas bone tissue any cell type
most people think of stem cells as a way
of generating replacement tissue for
dead and dying organs in the body but
I&#39;m more interested in how the disease
actually get started in the first place
so in my lab we are generating human
models of these diseases in order to
understand how these diseases work and
we&#39;re and we&#39;re using them to test drugs
and define better Diagnostics we&#39;re also
we&#39;ve also automated the process of
deriving stem cell lines in order to
look at large populations of people that
actually have this disease so for
example I can take a skin cell from a
patient with a doll timers disease and I
can turn that skin fell into a stem cell
and then by mimicking the processes of
development I can turn those stem cells
into the brain cells that are affected
by the disease this allows me to have a
living room go into the disease as it
progresses we&#39;ve been doing this from
patients that have the genetic forms of
the disease the kind that guarantees
that you will get it and we&#39;ve been able
to see the key indicators of the disease
things like the plaques and the tangles
start to develop in the petri dish and
we can see this without having to wait
years and years to as this disease
progresses in a patient but what about
the other ninety five percent of people
that get Alzheimer&#39;s disease but don&#39;t
have these mutations how do we
understand their disease this is
currently a very difficult question
because it&#39;s hard for us to predict who
is actually going to progress from it
all into Alzheimer&#39;s disease just
because you&#39;re forgetful doesn&#39;t
actually mean you&#39;re going to get all
sin and disease but ideally we would use
these same techniques to try to
understand these forms of the disease
and try to understand how this
ninety-five percent of people actually
gives the disease so when developing
models of this disease we know we need
to start with the controls we need to
understand how we need to understand all
timers disease and not a different kind
of
mention this is something that we can
only currently do after death
definitively but to address this problem
my lab has been able to recover living
cells from cadaver tissue from people
who have died from Alzheimer&#39;s disease
and we&#39;ve been able to recreate sim cell
lines from those those those cells and
these stem cells behave as the other
stem cells you they have the property of
pluripotency they can make all the
different cell types we can go a step
further we can recreate the brain tissue
from these people that die of this
disease we can recreate the neurons that
were affected by this disease from these
stem cells what you seeing in this movie
is a network of neurons recreated from
stem cells from a patient who had
already died from Alzheimer&#39;s disease
these neurons form connections and
synapses and they have spontaneous
activity properties that are similar to
those found in the brain it&#39;s these
neural network connections that are the
building blocks of learning and memory
and they are the target of this disease
in order to understand how to develop
therapies for this disease we need to
understand how these connections are
targeted by the disease and how the
cells eventually die and we&#39;re starting
to do this now what&#39;s exciting about
using stem cells from the deceased is it
gives us a new starting point to try to
understand the beginning of the disease
and instead of trying to answer what
went wrong only at they&#39;d be into the
disease we have the opportunity to
replay Alzheimer&#39;s disease over and over
and over again and the dish to
understand the beginning of the disease
and with these needs insights we should
be able to develop more effective
therapies for Alzheimer&#39;s disease this
is something that we can&#39;t currently do
now and intervening at the beginning is
when it would matter the most this is
where Alzheimer&#39;s disease lows and this
is where we could probably go to find
the beginning of the disease and power
progresses more effectively and maybe
find a cure thank
you
