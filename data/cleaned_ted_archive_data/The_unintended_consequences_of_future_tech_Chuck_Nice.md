ah so you know TED talks are normally
very light-hearted and upbeat so I hope
you&#39;ll forgive me because I&#39;m going to
be serious I am a futurist not to be
actually ima futurologists not to be
confused with a futurist because I am a
stand-up comedian and futurologists
sounds like in a very near term I may be
given a prostate exam okay this is going
well okay like that was as much as I
expected and you gave it to me you know
a future tech always comes with two
things promise and unintended
consequences and it&#39;s those consequences
that I want to explore and before we get
to how to protect may affect us I&#39;d like
to spend a little time exploring the
unintended consequences of some of our
recent texts social media social media a
few short years ago was the type of
future you now it just is you social
media was supposed to bring us together
in ways we could never imagine and the
predictors were correct these three
girls are talking to one another with
without the awkward discomfort of eye
contact
I call that advancement we were supposed
to be caught up in a communication
tsunami the likes of which the world has
never seen and that did happen and so
did this one of these things is not like
the other one of these things is not the
same which these things not like the
other tell me the cowards lady our game
now look at this picture if you picked
the guy with the book you are wrong or
as a certain president would say wrong
clearly three of these guys are reading
and one guy on the N is listening to
music and playing candy crush so are we
more connected or are we just more
connected to our devices social media
was supposed to place us in a veritable
town square where we could engage one
another with challenging ideas and
debate and instead what we got were
trolls this is an actual tweet that I
received Chuck no one wants to hear your
stupid ill-informed political views I
hope you get leprosy and dot love dad
now the great thing about that tweet if
you look at it just like most trolls
it&#39;s not that bad because he wished left
40 on me instead of leprosy and that 40
is not dangerous at all
[Applause]
along with trolls we got a brand new way
of torturing teenagers cyberbullying a
concept that my 75 year old mother just
can&#39;t seem to wrap her head around so I
said that did they hit him
no mom they didn&#39;t hit him did they take
his money
no mom they didn&#39;t take his money they
put the space in the toilet
no no Monday did what what did they do
they attacked him on the internet attack
them on the internet but why don&#39;t you
just turn off the internet your whole
generation is a bunch of Whoopie at that
point you see she&#39;s got a point and I
don&#39;t even want to talk about what
social media has done to dating I was on
Grindr until I found out it wasn&#39;t a
sandwich app but it was the best date of
my entire life
and I can&#39;t even tell you about tinder
except for the fact that if you think
that there is a limit to the amount of
anonymous sex we can have on this planet
you are sadly mistaken who&#39;s your daddy
I don&#39;t know I&#39;m a tinder baby
okay that one won&#39;t make you too
so where do we go from here well let&#39;s
just jump right in and play the hit
driverless cars something that has
already been around for many many years
just without the assistance of computers
because for years we have been driving
while texting putting on makeup shaving
reading actually reading that would be
me and some of us have been mining our
noses for a god only knows what what do
you expect to find up there sir what do
you expect to find you are spreading
your frontal lobe for God&#39;s sake
the other thing is that since driverless
cars will be shared most people won&#39;t
own cars and that means teenagers oh I&#39;m
sorry the DMV will go away the DMV I
know what you say right now there&#39;s no
way this guy&#39;s going to stand up here
and make a case for the DMV well I don&#39;t
know about you but I do not want to live
in a world where harsh fluorescent
lights endless lines terrible forms to
fill out and disaffected soulless
bureaucrat remind me that I am pretty
damn lucky not to work here
that is the real service they provide
the DMV come for the registration
renewal stay for the satisfaction of
knowing you made some pretty good life
choices
nobody will own their car in the future
and that means teenagers will not have a
place to make out so you know what that
means
that means they will order driverless
cars to do just that I do not want to
step into a vehicle and ask the question
why does this car smell like awkwardness
failure and shame
if I want to ask that question I walk
into my own bedroom I&#39;m oversharing I&#39;m
probably oversharing
so where do we go from here aside from
the fact that the last thing that I hate
about driverless cars is that they have
already been introduced in the Fast and
the Furious movie franchise mm-hmm
ruining perfection shouldn&#39;t put that
one in I knew nobody in this room has
ever seen a Fast and the Furious movie
[Laughter]
so what else do we have to look forward
to that&#39;s right artificial intelligence
now we&#39;re back on track that&#39;s something
everybody in this room loves artificial
intelligence yes you know there was a
time when artificial intelligence was a
joke I mean literally equipped that you
would hear at a cocktail party when
somebody would bring it up in
conversation artificial intelligence
the only real artificial intelligence is
our American Congress well it&#39;s not
funny anymore Stephen Hawking Elon Musk
and Bill Gates have all gone on record
expressing grave reservations about
artificial intelligence that&#39;s like
Jesus Moses and Mohammed coming together
and saying guys guys here&#39;s something we
can all believe in you might want to go
with that it&#39;s all I&#39;m saying we are
actually teaching machines how to think
how to understand our behavior how to
defend themselves and even practice
deception what could possibly go wrong
the one thing is for sure
the creation always despises its creator
okay
the Tyson&#39;s rose up against the gods
Lucifer against Jehovah and anybody who
has a teenager has heard these words I
hate you in the road in my life I thank
you now just imagine that sentiment with
a machine that can out thank you and is
heavily armed
the result absolutely what we need to do
before we perfect artificial
intelligence it&#39;s perfect artificial
emotions that way we can teach the
robots or machines how to love us
unconditionally so that when they figure
out that the only real problem on this
planet is us instead of destroying us
which by the way is totally logical they
will find us adorable like baby poop oh
my god I just love the way you destroy
the planet and thank you I&#39;ll take your
pretty applause thank you
but that&#39;s much different another time
[Laughter]
can&#39;t talk about this without talking
about robotics okay remember when you
thought robotics were cool oh that&#39;s you
guys all of you still think robotics are
cool all of you I remember when I
thought robotics were cool until I
figured out that they were going to take
everybody&#39;s place from the delivery guy
down to the heart surgeon to this cute
little guy right there I could take a
back to him and go eat lunch I&#39;m sorry
okay a little too violent for this crowd
the one thing though that is very
disappointing about robotics is the holy
grail of robotics and it hasn&#39;t even
happened I&#39;m talking about the robot
girlfriend I&#39;m sorry
the dream of one lonely geek in a
windowless basement who vowed one day I
am going to marry my creation and there
actually is a movement underway to stop
this from happening
for fear of exploitation and I for one
am against that movement I believe we
should have robot girlfriend I just
believe that they should come with a
feminist protocol and artificial
intelligence so she can take one look at
that guy and go I am too good for you
I&#39;m leaving and finally I have to talk
about bioengineering an area of science
that promises to end disease before it
even begins to help us live longer
fuller healthier lives and when you
couple that with implantable hardware
you are looking at the next incarnation
of human evolution and all of that
sounds great until you figure out where
it&#39;s really going one place designer
babies where no matter where you are on
the globe or what your ethnicity babies
will end up looking like that
that boy is surprised because he just
found out both his parents are black
[Applause]
if you imagine him at a cocktail party
in 20 years yeah both my parents are
black I mean little awkward at times but
you should see my credit rating
impressive very impressive now all of
this seems scary and everybody in this
room knows that it is it technology
isn&#39;t scary never has been and it never
will be what&#39;s scary is us and what we
will do with technology will we allow it
to expose our humanity showing our true
selves and reinforcing the fact that we
are indeed our brother&#39;s keeper or will
we allow it to reveal our deepest
darkest demons the true question is not
whether or not technology is scary the
true question is how human are you thank
you
[Music]
you
