thank you a year ago I stood on the
stage and I made a wish born of a
childhood dream to discover ancient
sites now expanded to the world we spent
the last year building globalexplorer an
online citizen science crowdsourcing
archeology platform in partnership with
National Geographic digital globe and
Tom na we wanted to create something fun
easy-to-use and engaging so explorers
from 5 to 105 could participate and
something that archaeologists could use
but this was a huge experiment what at
work would people find things would we
create an engaged global community
fortunately we archaeologists are
completely crazy we believe that you can
rewrite history from a single bone so we
launched global explore three months ago
working with peru&#39;s Ministries of
culture and tourism and with our ground
partner the sustainable preservation
initiative as of an hour ago we have had
over 45,000 users who have looked at
over 10.5 million
satellite images they that has covered
an area of over 100,000 square
kilometers and I&#39;m so excited to share
with you today we spent the last two
weeks reviewing the results and to date
our global explorers have discovered
over 29,000 ancient sites and features
now we spent the last few weeks looking
at these results and you know what our
crowd is awesome we have virtually no
false positives we can&#39;t say yet whether
these sites are completely new or
already known that&#39;s going to take time
but lob averages a lot of them are going
to be new discovery sites like this or
this we&#39;d hope to get out of the field
last month to look at some of these
sites but with the flooding in Peru we
couldn&#39;t that&#39;s okay we&#39;ll spend the
next few months looking at them now I
want to tell you about some of our
amazing global explorers who come from
over 200 countries including American
Samoa Yemen and Syria meet Doris Doris
is 90 years old she comes from Ohio and
she&#39;s largely housebound she feels like
globalexplorer allows her to make a real
contribution to science without leaving
her home now Doris has looked at over
50,000 satellite images reaching the
level of space archaeologists I mean of
course she has she&#39;s gonna put me out of
business
Doris you rock this is Maha
he&#39;s from India he dreamt of being an
archaeologist as a young child but went
on to be a doctor instead he now uses
global explore with his nephew and hopes
to inspire him to pursue his dreams of
exploration and discovery a year ago I
talked to you about our work at leashed
a site in Egypt dating to 3,800 years
ago we just ran a field school this past
December training brilliant young
Egyptians in satellite imagery survey
and excavation I want to show you some
of our cool finds this beautiful little
segment figurine and the stunning
inscribed blood we&#39;re going to be
announcing country to later this year
long term the plan is to build a Center
for archaeological innovation which will
house our crowdsourcing exploration and
education initiatives this will take
time and support but will help to define
the future of archaeology so last year
when I walked on stage I had a hat just
like this one to me it represents the
excitement of discovering the potential
of
cheating the impossible and living out
your childhood dreams of exploring the
ancient world but as I&#39;ve learned this
year that dream doesn&#39;t belong to me
anymore it&#39;s yours and this now belongs
to you thank you
