thank you Anna hey um so okay to talk oh
sorry um please just give us an update
on what&#39;s happened a year on from
winning a prize yeah so I mean it&#39;s been
a thrilling ride since last year when
charming was standing on the stage one
of the biggest successes is the UK
government is passing new laws that
would go a long way to solve this
problem in fact earlier today the House
of Lords in the UK voted through the
legislation we&#39;re also seeing similar
laws in Europe now in the US well as my
colleagues based in Washington will tell
you politics in the u.s. can be rather
difficult but we&#39;re making real progress
and having important voices speaking out
for example in Delaware we also have
made some real progress getting and
talking to the business community a
group of business leaders called the BT
founded by richard branson mo ibrahim
and the boss of Unilever are starting to
make the business case for ending
anonymous companies and they&#39;re also
starting to show how they can make
progress within their own organizations
so reading the headlines lately it would
also suggest that the public awareness
for this is growing is that something
that you&#39;re sensing yeah I think I mean
I think you&#39;re right Anna and I think a
lot of you will have seen the headlines
around HSBC where thousands of their
customers at their Swiss branch use
shell companies to hide their money from
the tax authorities all those the New
York Times five part series on
suspicious characters moving their money
buying real estate in New York again
through shell companies I think a year
ago people have seen these as two
separate different stories but now
people are starting to connect the dots
they&#39;re starting to see that these
problems are joined and that there&#39;s a
potential solution so the momentum is
building what&#39;s next for the wish
so this is Ted and we want to continue
to tell the story so I&#39;m really pleased
to say that we&#39;re teaming up with
Sundance and with vice news to produce a
documentary film about this issue now
Global Witness was founded 20 years ago
by Charmin and Simon and Patrick and
they started it by investigating and
investigations are in our DNA we use
hidden cameras and talk to
whistleblowers to reveal the truth
behind corruption and conflict so we
have a really interesting explosive
investigation in the works and can&#39;t
tell you any more but watch this space
and then finally we need to keep up the
momentum for change and we need to win
more of the political battles that we&#39;ve
won in the UK and Europe well keep
fighting the fight Robert we&#39;re right
there beside you and i&#39;ll see on the
conference call next week thank you
