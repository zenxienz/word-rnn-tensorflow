so how inspirational was this set of
talks especially knowing that my
knowledge memory is the size of pea I
would like to discuss Bogota as
combination of bottom-up urbanism
crowdsourcing and crowdfunding of course
we all know that Latin America has not
only a booming economy but also booming
urbanization currently 75 percent of all
the Latin Americans live in cities and
not only that they don&#39;t only live in
cities it&#39;s also whole new middle class
growing the middle class currently for
the first time in history is actually
the same size as the lower income or the
lowest income group and not only does
this mean something for the people for
the Society for the economy more it
means something for the city as you can
see here Bogota is also an amazing
example not only because it has the
highest urbanization rate of 5.5% and it
has also had an amazing string of mayors
in between mayors which were not so
successful Antanas mockers and enrique
pena Llosa both have had very very
unconservative methods and amazing
success in less than 10 years they have
actually reached or changed a city which
was really overdrawn with corruption was
considered the most dangerous capital in
the world and have made it into
something which is actually civilized
people are concerned and citizens are
very successful in interacting with it
but why is it not working for downtown
Bogota itself inconsistency in political
rules and corruption the mayor typically
is only three years of rule which is
very very short have proven in success
unsuccessful to actually change the city
especially the city center so bottom-up
approach is really the only way to go
for this city or maybe for any city and
a bottom-up approach to is
is actually an academic thinking a very
normal and intriguing principle but for
urban planning it&#39;s quite unusual and
maybe why it&#39;s so interesting is because
it really deals with intrinsic qualities
and intrinsic qualities as you probably
know our qualities which are already
there so we are not making up a top-down
plan we are looking what is in the city
how can we harness that and how can we
get innovation out of that that is not
an abnormal thing in the third world
this is a true Cairo where in an
informal neighborhood the people were
seriously disturbed by the fact that the
Ring Road was passing by and with that
their chance to work to civilization to
be part of a booming economy and they
decided themselves to build an
off-and-on rounds from rubble and
garbage and not only that they also put
a little station on the top of it for
the police to come and surveil which
they actually did so that was a hugely
successful endeavor
this however is actually still a group
of people who are considered
lower-income we have a different
situation in Latin America and that is
that there is a growing middle class
which are going to decide the city of
the future and who currently don&#39;t have
enough housing they don&#39;t have enough of
almost anything this situation was not
exactly known to me it was introduced to
me by rodrigo nino the creator of my
ideal city and my ideal city is in a
non-political platform which actually
combines interesting things together
crowdsourcing people can interact on an
internet website and give direct
feedback real-time conversations with
experts but he doesn&#39;t do or we just
don&#39;t do that it&#39;s also combined with
crowdfunding interesting is that these
discussions are an ongoing thing which
constantly feedback on initiatives
proposals and questions this is not
necessarily coming out of nowhere the
proposal which is already
currently in downtown Bogota is btw
Paquita Rodrigo from protein Network
actually raised from over 3,200
investors more than 200 million dollars
to get this project built which is not
only the highest skyscraper in Bogota
where for 35 years no one has been able
to raise the money to do any project
this size but it&#39;s also world&#39;s largest
crowd funding project and really
promoters who who sponsors this project
has them to decided together with
Rodrigo that this might be not the only
possibility if we can do a building
can&#39;t we look at the city so Rodrigo
came to a sadhaka tectonics and asked us
to be the elite architect to put a team
of experts together to start to look at
what is a bottom-up and proposal how do
you get together I have 9 minutes to
tell you this so I&#39;m only showing two
scenarios but the two scenarios we
thought were the most interesting are
the most obvious also if you look at
downtown Bogota you see it&#39;s a speck in
the overall size of Bogota it is a
downtown now don&#39;t I that might mean
nothing for people coming from the
Americas but actually I&#39;m a European and
we think of the city center as a city
center a city center is a combination of
political cultural social factors
whereas a downtown in the Americas where
the term comes from is really a business
center so what it misses in downtown
Bogota is demographics there&#39;s no people
living there and the facilities for
people living there and we realized with
a mere two hundred and fifty seven
thousand people living there then 1.7
million people commute daily in and out
of that little tiny city center to get
to their work and often they take four
hours to get there
so social family life is suffering a
little bit that but also what is
interesting 1 million of those people
are actually students visiting the over
33 universities that
tambopata so thinking about that what
about if we start to think that you
could house these students over a
million students would you reduce
traffic the congestion the pollution
improve family life so that people can
actually see each other after school and
afterward yes that would be a really
really interesting idea so we started
looking at the map of Bogota and as you
can see here there&#39;s a really
interesting region on the top for
high-density housing a really
interesting region on the bottom for
maybe me density housing which is the
more the bottom of downtown which is
more river life question how do you fund
this the current situation in Latin
America with very high interest rates in
banks and incredible in stable money
values and and currencies how do you
start to do that this is where the
interesting thing of crowdfunding came
in and this is where also
decision-making of people comes in so
where you can start to think and which
seems it may be a quite top-down
approach you know you start to build
towers in a downtown it&#39;s actually
interesting if the people decide to
build these towers if they decide that
they want their kids to live close to
the universities that&#39;s a whole other
approach so here you start to see we
grow towers Biddy bucket us actually
there&#39;s the orange tower you start to
grow towers and then maybe it&#39;s possible
that downtown starts to connect to the
higher region the more northern region
which is already the business district
so now there is maybe a weaving of
culture social life and interactivity of
students and business people not only
that but if you go to the lower area of
the same
don&#39;t you get an area where there is
extreme low density and we thought if
you managed to change that extreme low
density into something which is maybe
mid density could you have a whole new
landscape and what would people want to
do with those landscapes and that comes
to the second scenario which is
revitalization of the rivers in Bogota
Bogota is situated on the bottom of a
set of hills had 50,000 hectares of
wetlands originally the rivers are up
coming from the mountains they are the
source of drinking water and currently
the wetlands are 3 percent of what it
originally was and not only that the
rivers are canalized
there in big concrete buckets let&#39;s say
and the problem with that is that not
only is it very dry if there is very
little water
it also floods incredibly because a big
because of the concrete bed the
surrounding earth is really really hard
so as you see here in 2009 almost that
whole area flooded causing massive
damage and who wouldn&#39;t want to have a
river bed like this which is actually
simply a naturalised riverbed which then
allows for flood lands it allows for
urban agriculture community gardens and
maybe eventually also change this very
very low density area where it&#39;s very
very spread out in a more ecological
landscape where you start to see the
river the landscape the agriculture
which then only doesn&#39;t only provide
beautiful nature but also work farmers
markets fair distribution of food and
hopefully also recreation and eventually
maybe both that would become this the
next location for the Olympics
really important of course to close this
down is that this model for my ideal
city is not just for the city center of
Bogota hopefully the needs and ones of
people in the future can be decided this
way through crowdsourcing and
funding thank you
