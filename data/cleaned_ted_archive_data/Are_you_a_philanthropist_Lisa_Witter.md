slide please hi everyone thanks Jackie
well I was doing some research for this
and I decided to do a man on the street
survey or should I say a man and woman
on the street survey and I asked people
when I say the word philanthropist what
first comes to mind who first comes to
mind and not surprisingly one of these
extraordinary men they&#39;re extraordinary
men who have given extraordinary large
amounts of money to do great things but
if you stop your view at philanthropy
adjust these men you&#39;re not seeing the
full picture I&#39;m here today to tell you
some data from the Women&#39;s Philanthropy
Institute at the center for philanthropy
indiana university or i&#39;m a member of
we&#39;re going to look at the differences
between male and female giving to
philanthropy now it&#39;s important to note
that we do not look at married women or
married men because in a marriage we
can&#39;t tell the difference who makes the
decision so let&#39;s look at the first data
so income levels you can see here that
across all income levels q1 is
twenty-three thousand dollars or less up
to you q5 103 thousand dollars or more
but across every income level except for
the second q women are giving more than
men and if you look at the numbers and
add it up they&#39;re likely to give twice
as much let&#39;s look at marital status so
beyonce is all the single ladies never
married women give more than never
married men divorce women give more than
divorced men and widowed men the outlier
here give more than widowed women now
why is that so some women who outlive
their husbands often feel a sense of
economic insecurity so widowed men give
more now i&#39;m really excited from the
stage the very first moment to be
releasing this data on causes what do
women support compared to men so if you
look at the number read is women again
gray is men across all causes religion
combined which is like united way the
needy healthcare education youth arts
community environment international
women give more than men in every
category except for to where they give
the same or likely to give the same so
let&#39;s do a deeper look international
women are fifty five percent more likely
to give them in community their 51%
religion forty-two percent so the
churches are
are really being built on women health
care and so on so the question is why
does this happen well we know from
philanthropy that there are a lot of
reasons why women and men give people
care and we know that women are
biologically different and their social
lives different but we know specifically
with such great difference in community
and international but it&#39;s about
connections women want to be engaged in
philanthropy because they want to feel
connected hands to spread with community
they give to their community because
they feel connected and the same when we
interviewed donors on international why
are they more likely to men but give
well they see community is not
necessarily just in their neighborhood
but their aspirationally building in
international community so I want to
leave you with this imagine if people
out in the world realized that women
were more likely to be philanthropist
and imagine if they realize the women
are often likely to give twice as much
as men imagine if you were likely to
call yourself a philanthropist how would
the world be different thank you
