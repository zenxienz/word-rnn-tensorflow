last year at breakfast at the Sheraton I
walked past a table and I heard this my
aunt left her teeth at Hooters I started
walking backwards I turned around I said
I&#39;ve got uh sat down with you now I am
an extreme extrovert but that took a lot
for me to overcome the voices in my head
that said you can&#39;t just go sit down who
do you think you are and actually sit
down and it was the beginning of a
wonderful friendship with fellow tedster
Ruby Wax
so so what are these things that you can
do when especially that I do every day
and many many times a day to overcome
those voices in your head I call them
the graces and because this is the
afternoon of acronyms I will tell you
about those Grace&#39;s generosity rescue
attention confidence exact and
serendipity generosity that is the basis
for all of networks that&#39;s really the
basis of Ted I mean we would not be here
without the generosity of everybody
who&#39;s a part of Ted it&#39;s not a zero-sum
game it is about openness
it&#39;s about connectivity come forth this
entire week with a spirit of generosity
and I would argue throughout your entire
life for the spirit of generosity and it
will pay off in ways you could only
begin to imagine really mmm absolutely
true rescue see that person over here in
the corner who looks like they&#39;re lost
or looks like they don&#39;t know quite
where to go or who looks just a little
bit block lonely go over and talk to
them introduce yourself
that other person over there who looks
like they&#39;re stuck in a conversation
that they can&#39;t extricate themselves
from
we&#39;ve all been there go over and it&#39;s
just insinuate yourself in that
conversation let&#39;s see throw them a
rescue line attention and we know that
that is the scarcest of all resources
and we know we all crave it and we know
we have millions of devices and millions
of things that will pull us away from
having it giving our full attention it&#39;s
been talked about before today but
really truly the quality of the
relationship the quality of the
conversations and the interactions that
you&#39;ll have this entire week and again
throughout life is just not pretend or
not just for Ted it is about your full
attention there&#39;s a phrase that I
learned my daughter called FOMO which is
fear of missing out and I spent I spend
most of my life following and and Ted is
really a place that you can just go nuts
with FOMO because you&#39;re in this really
good conversation and then you think oh
my god this is what&#39;s going on over
there don&#39;t you fear we in a great
conversation stay in that and when
you&#39;re ready to go on go on but you will
die trying to get to that next
conversation that it doesn&#39;t exist stay
where you are until you&#39;re ready move
confidence
this is a this is a week to go forth
unafraid this is one to be not be afraid
of jumping into a conversation
these are carefully curated sees and if
you&#39;re even in this room or in this
place for this time that means you&#39;re
remarkable
so trust that you can jump in to the
waters and swim in any conversation come
up to anybody that you want to meet do
it exact the way that you get what you
want I guess everything in life is that
way the way that you get to meet the
people that you want to meet is to be
very specific
so right now I&#39;m studying or learning
about and most interested in traumatic
brain injury so you might think of me as
the concussion person right because I&#39;m
working on a particular project so when
I&#39;m talking to I&#39;m going to say if you
know anything about brain injury if you
know somebody who&#39;s had a brain injury
and we heard from one person today with
that I want to meet them so the more
specific you can be both about what you
need
and what you want and whom you want to
meet and about what you&#39;re willing to
give and what you can give the more
likely you can&#39;t as you put that out
into this community it will come back to
you in ways you can&#39;t imagine I mean
everyone has stories about it&#39;s the most
remarkable week ever and part of that is
because people really do want to give
and they really want to give to you and
if you tell them what you want exactly
and who you want to meet exactly you&#39;re
likely to get it and last but not least
of course is serendipity which is when
all else goes forth then trust
serendipity this is that moment that you
think oh I&#39;m lost but there&#39;s somebody
with a but let me go say hello to them
and they turn out to be the most
interest in the person you met all week
or like another conference I was at
recently where I sat down with someone
whom I barely knew and at the end of it
my daughter had a fantastic summer job
so these moments it&#39;s great right that
was like that was a good that was really
good that&#39;s a great much so so these
graces that I work with every day and
they are the things that will help you
drown out those voices that tell you
what you can&#39;t do and what you shouldn&#39;t
do and then you&#39;re it&#39;s not possible for
you to do you can so practice them and
I&#39;ll give you three challenges so number
one is choose 5 choose 5 just 5 people
this is the first challenge but go
through that the Kinect test app is a
great app go through and choose five
people that you want to meet this week
and reach out to them and specifically
tell them why you want to meet with them
and chances are you&#39;ll get the meeting
exactly we&#39;re going to meet them exactly
what what place but time that&#39;s one the
second one is sit with someone noon it&#39;s
really tempting when you see your
friends here to go sit with them there&#39;s
many sessions each day so make sure that
for at least one session each day you
sit with strangers nice things happen
and finally connect don&#39;t be afraid go
forth in with a spirit of generosity and
assume that everybody else your
is generous as you are or maybe even
more so and that if you go ahead and
tell people what you want and what
you&#39;re willing to give that likely will
deliver so go ahead and come practice
the graces on me and I cannot wait to
meet you and have a great 10
