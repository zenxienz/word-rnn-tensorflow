leads them they&#39;re what we call things
matters I&#39;m a theater director but even
though I make my work in traditional
theatrical settings
I had directed a little bit differently
I&#39;m Mohegan we&#39;re a northeastern
Woodlands people on the shoreline in
Connecticut my tribe is matriarchal and
our stories ways of understanding for my
culture affect the way I lead I was
taught a worldview without a living
language my tribes language like many
indigenous languages was brought to the
point of extinction by colonialism
people say that the heart of a cultures
in its language in Mohegan when you and
I are an equation in a sentence you
always comes first it&#39;s a language in
which it&#39;s impossible to think of
yourself before others during my
lifetime my elders have been working
very hard to restore the Mohegan
language but I frequently run into
moments when something I&#39;ve been taught
a way of being in the world cannot be
spoken there&#39;s a gap between my head my
heart and my tongue
I cannot articulate I get stuck in the
space of what is lost when I graduated
from acting school I switched over to
directing because I ran into a few too
many situations where a non-native
director turned to an all-native cast
and said hey Singh that Indian song then
stared at us waiting we didn&#39;t all
magically know the same song we weren&#39;t
even from the same tribe or culture yet
we were constantly being lumped together
into a very finite understanding of what
it is to be native little secret it&#39;s
not something that can be checked in a
box one of the most beautiful things
about Mohegan stories our language and
culture is the integration of ideologies
instead of boxes and binaries in Mohegan
you don&#39;t separate art from politics
from education from the earth from you
from me from our community everything is
woven together because there are no hard
lines breaking up our universe ideas
lean on each
they&#39;re like people so I I started to
wonder what happened how did we lose
this community connection who decided
that that person at the front of the
room was suddenly more important or
magically all-knowing instead of what
they are a part of the group what
happens if we look for connections
instead of divides lead from a place of
listening from a place of love as
someone who directs both in and out of
the native community I became aware of a
divide where the theatre industry&#39;s
language seemed to be poisoning what I
believed was important about the process
of telling stories of building worlds on
stage frustrated I went and I spoke to
one of my friends and mentors playwright
William yellow robe about it one of the
fathers of contemporary native theatre
he told me to really have a strong
native theater movement we needed to be
using the words in our own languages for
what we were doing director the word
director is not particularly elegant
imaginative passionate when I hear it I
think of someone directing traffic
barking orders aggression and I realized
I don&#39;t want that job so I went and I
asked mohegan elder Stephanie Fielding
what our word for a director would be
cut tahan I use cynic walk what&#39;s it
mean the closest English translation is
the heart she leads us there embedded in
that word is everything I was missing a
leadership model invested in the
community rather than itself now when
I&#39;m scared I&#39;m reminded it&#39;s not about
me as the director my job is to take
care of the group to connect to
translate to inspire to make sure we&#39;re
all moving forward on our journey
together what we call things it matters
what job do you want to have director
Kutta hon iesson o&#39;clock our heart she
leads us there - but knee thank you
