I&#39;m going to try to use the word
pandemics and good news in a single
sentence and in a single talk for the
first time usually when i talk about
pandemics i talk about doom and gloom
but things are happening in a good way
and i want to tell you a little about
some of them so first let me just review
why do we need good news about pandemic
because in the last three decades there
have been three dozen emerging
communicable diseases that have pandemic
potential any one of them could cause a
pandemic that killed millions or tens of
millions of people so a lot of people
cleared all the time many have been
obsessed about pandemics I am one of
them we we tried to make a movie our
sister organization participant media
and Warner Brothers we tried to make a
movie showing what a real pandemic would
look like to try to reset expectations
some of you have seen this movie how
many of you have seen contagion so
you&#39;ll recognize this is the end of the
movie but it&#39;s the beginning of the
epidemic and it shows tractors knocking
down trees causing deforestation
disturbing the habitat of bats who move
into the human food chain by dropping an
apple a pig it&#39;s the Apple what happens
to the pig is what happens to all pigs
they get slaughtered and then by blood
transmission the cook contracts the
virus that previously was in the bat and
then the virus changes from being a GI
virus to a blood-borne virus to a
respiratory virus which is our greatest
fear and then when a Qualtrough
contracted the disease and then we kill
her off in the first frame of the movie
if you remember
the things have changed especially
innovations in technology that make it
possible for us to be much more
optimistic because the key to stopping
pandemics is early detection early
response and here is what I&#39;m talking
about in 1996 a pandemic potential virus
would stay hidden on average 167 days
before it was detected three years ago
that number fell to 23 days it&#39;s a world
of difference between waiting five to
six months to find a new pandemic then
finding it in three weeks so the key of
early detection has got to be understood
better this is published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences and I&#39;m pleased that we helped
fund this because finding this out was
not an easy task but why are we getting
better and better at finding early
diseases we when I spoke here before I
told you that there were two digital
surveillance systems jisun and promed
that had found SARS very early but now
because the wh 0 changed the
international health regulations to
encourage digital surveillance systems
NGOs going out there trolling trying new
experiments I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t prove it
but I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s one of the
major reasons why we&#39;re fighting
diseases so much sooner and I&#39;m
optimistic that the next few years with
new ideas new technologies and new
policies we&#39;re going to drive that
number down from 23 to 15 27 if you can
drive that number down to seven we have
a chance to actually ask the question
can we end pandemics in our lifetime
look at the proliferation of new
activities and organizations all in the
last 10 years so we&#39;re unleashing the
power of innovation and technology by
changing the game yes understand how
that affects the number of cases this is
the epidemiological curve we epi curve
it epidemiologists love
we have number of cases versus time the
usual epidemic has routine health
reporting just before the peak but if
you find the outbreak earlier with a
doctor&#39;s report that will cut off the
top of that curve reducing the number of
cases if you find it earlier with
newspaper reports even a fewer cases if
you find it earlier than that with
social media and earlier in the met with
keystrokes you make that epidemic
smaller and smaller even better in the
Holy Grail if you find the disease while
it&#39;s still in animals the whole theory
of one help this is Google Flu Trends it
shows that by monitoring keystrokes we
are able to beat CDC&#39;s reports by two
weeks find flu or any other flu-like
disease two weeks sooner this is a new
participatory surveillance system that
we did at scroll global threats fund by
asking people are you sick or are you
well with a weekly SMS or a weekly email
we now have 50,000 people who have
volunteered in the United States we beat
Google Flu Trends which beat CDC and it
is a race to success here but it&#39;s more
than just finding new outbreak sooner
and of course i&#39;m not talking about
bioterrorism i&#39;m not talking about
laboratory air we&#39;re talking about a
very distinct kind of pendant what&#39;s
more exciting is as we learn more about
where pandemics come from we can begin
to understand the hot spots from where
respiratory diseases come from where GI
diseases come from where blood-borne
diseases come from and we can put a
circle around them administrative lee as
we&#39;re doing and the next time I talk to
this group I hope I&#39;ll have a chance to
talk about these amazing new
organizations that are not governmental
that our NGO based that are helping to
share best practices so I put all that
together there&#39;s room for a little
optimism for the first time we have
better policy we have better regional
cooperation we have much better
technology and if we continue to invest
in this new technology and unleash this
burst of enthusiasm and new innovations
I think we can end pandemics in our
lifetimes thank you very much
