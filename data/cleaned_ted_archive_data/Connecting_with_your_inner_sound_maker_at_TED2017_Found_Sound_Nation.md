so maybe you&#39;re a professional musician
maybe you&#39;re a displaced person maybe
you&#39;re a hedge fund manager or an
incarcerated kid rillette foundation
believes that for all of us music making
is our birthright and when you&#39;re
creating an original piece of music
there&#39;s something profoundly egalitarian
about and to quote rabbi sacks we don&#39;t
know what the future US is going to
sound like but when we find a sound that
incorporates all of the voices in the
room reso the seed of a new vital
community that is more that is capable
of more than the sum of its parts and
over the last few years we&#39;ve been
developing many models for this musical
co-creation from Street Studios the
models we&#39;ve learned like the hip hop
cypher to models like the sonic
meditations and we&#39;ve done this in
places like Rikers Island refugee camps
and global diplomacy programs and here
at Ted we built this dome we call it the
aura Boreum it&#39;s the zebra looking thing
that was making strange noises this week
and this video were about to show
features sounds that were created in the
dome by the Ted 2017 community and
features images of the intrepid souls
who came in and put themselves out there
in search of a common voice it also
features this video features my
co-founder Chris Mary Nettie
who had to fly home to New York last
night because his first baby is being
born right now so enjoy the Ted assclown
foundation to create a musical
installation we did not know what we&#39;re
going to do but we said yes we wanted
people to connect with their inner sound
makers we thought immediately of the
street studio transport the Satan
recording
you and all the elements including on
the streets to create a set of song
which people as they pass by so that got
me thinking could we put nine people in
a room together and spontaneously create
the cozy suitcases a sonic discussion
how can we create this instrument where
you could not create a sound without it
affecting everyone else in the circle
all of these questions and this is the
result
[Applause]
[Music]
to be really good in your seat means not
just a mastery over your tools but a
mastery over you there are more places
to be heard and there are more and more
places to speak but if we&#39;re not
listening to each other then that
becomes a noise it&#39;s about finding your
own sound
