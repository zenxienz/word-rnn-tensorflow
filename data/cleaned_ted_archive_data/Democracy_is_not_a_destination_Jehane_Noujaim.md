thank you it&#39;s an honor to be back here
so we&#39;ll start
three years ago I stood in that square
and did the only thing I knew how to do
filme what was happening doctors were
helping the injured singers sang to
encourage the protesters everybody did
what they could do to transform the
square into the utopia that they wanted
all of Egypt to be and around us we
could hear we will no longer live in the
story that has been written for us we
demand to be the authors of our own
story and you as an audience we&#39;re a
part of it too all over the world your
witness turned our efforts from a lonely
local fight into a global struggle I met
Ahmed Hassan in the square and fell in
love with his beautiful spirit Achmed is
one of the authors of Egypt&#39;s future
higher was became my local
ah she said that cause what I did you
how long after
and tip number solar have a
inshallah
what happened in that square was magical
but three years later what now when you
read the news it seems like the
revolution has failed we&#39;ve lost dear
friends and have many more in jail
people ask us when will egypt ever have
a western-style democracy but the
success or failure of the revolution
cannot be determined only by the most
recent political outcomes if I have
learned anything over the past three
years democracy is a journey not a
destination and the hope that I see is
in the streets and with a younger
generation that refuses to be silenced
refuses to have their story written for
them the truth may not always be shown
on television but it&#39;s being painted on
the walls tweeted shared when an
injustice is done it is filmed and
uploaded when an innocent is hurt or
killed their memory is honored across
all the downtown walls now this is on
Mar a graffiti artist who is in our film
he became known internationally because
he refused to stop painting stop
painting the story is through the tear
gas and all the flying bullets now
visitors would applaud him saying WOW
Egyptians are expressing themselves and
painting on walls for the very first
time he would sit back and joke and say
well we have been painting on walls for
5000 years but yes our voices will be
heard we will continue to write the
story of our future now there may not be
one leader that has come out of the
revolution yet but as Ahmed says this is
bigger than one leader
dad in the world I&#39;ll call it yes come
the wooden wine is infinite I&#39;ll go get
the metallic red
the square has been released on netflix
in 50 countries are meds words we&#39;re
looking for a conscience has been
tweeted into dozens of languages the
square has now been seen by millions but
no Kris we did not win the Hollywood
Oscar of a couple weeks ago but again
the chiro streets wrote their own story
a few hours after the Oscars were
announced the kate gave us the oscar of
the street the chiro streets allowed the
best oscar we could have possibly
imagined and now a news story is being
written in our increasingly borderless
world as protesters are translating and
showing our film themselves in squares
in kiev caracas and moscow and other
squares middens plazas and piazzas
across the world truth and courage are
contagious so catch them while that
while you can and my wish for you is you
find your own square thank you very much
thank you
