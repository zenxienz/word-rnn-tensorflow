so for the last 50 years we in the first
world have been chasing low-cost ledyba
from country to country manufacturing
our consumer goods and our consumer
goods change very quickly so we have to
have flexible assembly lines but that
era is coming to an end and as standard
of living goes up in other places and
people wanting to reassure manufacturing
closer to home so here&#39;s a Moto X
factory in Texas but the sorts of jobs
you have to do in these factories are
incredibly boring and normal human
beings shouldn&#39;t have to do them so how
about using robots to do them problem
with robots is that complex devices
industrial robots take 9 to 18 months to
set up and they have to do the same task
for years and years and you have to be
an expert the program they have to
understand quaternions and all sorts of
things like that and the some of the
reasons that they&#39;re so complex to set
up is you need the controller you
there&#39;s terrible user interfaces if you
can see in that top left corner you have
to add lots of sensors and they&#39;re
unsafe to be around so if to put cages
around them so that people don&#39;t run
into them so what you see in factories
with robots is people lost factories on
the left not the warm and fuzzy robots
one might expect to have doing things on
the right a lot of companies are trying
to make things better on the top
companies making robots sense people
when they&#39;re nearby or on the bottom
they&#39;re try and make robots
intrinsically safe but what hasn&#39;t
happened is making robots easy to use
the same way our consumer goods have
been made easy to use imagine had to be
an expert to use a smartphone we
wouldn&#39;t be using them so last year on
the main stage I introduced Baxter a
robot that is easy to use that can go
into factories and that is slides in and
interfaces with the existing systems
there you don&#39;t have to have lots of
wires and lots of programming and in
fact ordinary factory workers can learn
how to train Baxter in just a few
minutes so Jason attack here in a
plastics factory in Pennsylvania trains
the robot to do things and workers in
that Factory and other factories come up
to him and say can can we get Baxter to
do this really terrible job that we
don&#39;t like doing and then you see in
another Factory
Baxter packing kits working arm you know
arm to arm to ordinary workers they&#39;re
not scared of it
notice here though that everyone needs
to build custom hands for these robots
they use 3d printers to put special
hands on there and the maker movement is
making this more possible and I think as
the maker movement gets more entrenched
in society more people become makers and
as 3d printers let us do more flexible
things as part of the manufacturing
process and as CAD involves
manufacturing information our whole
models of production are going to change
right now a product company sends a
design off to a foreign country they
make the goods send them back to retail
they get distributed here at home in
whatever which other countries home in
the future product companies may send
out design directly to retail who then
get things to be built locally and
distributed locally so the whole
economics changes so we&#39;ve got Baxter
beautiful looking robot is Baxter the
ultimate robot not by a longshot
there&#39;s a lot of things we can&#39;t do yet
with robots and so I put four challenges
forward but all researchers to try to
work on which will make our robots
better if we can get as good or even
close to as good as a two-year-old is as
good an object recognition object class
recognition not image recognition but
object class recognition and robots will
be much better
four-year-old children can understand
language much better than Siri or any of
our language understanding systems they
understand accents they understand nor
in noisy environments so speech is
another important thing a six-year-old
child has manual dexterity good enough
to do any task we ask a factory worker
can do in a low-cost production region
but our robots are nowhere near as good
at manual dexterity and lastly an
eight-year-old child has social
understanding they know what&#39;s true
what&#39;s not true
who knows what and how to interact with
people in the knowledge economy amongst
themselves that&#39;s what we need to get
our robots better at and then we&#39;re
going to have robots being doing doing
lots and lots of things in our lives
