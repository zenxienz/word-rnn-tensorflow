Oh many of you know me as Taylor Dayne
this singer the girl with the big hair
big lips in that big ballsy voice my
voice my greatest gift
my greatest salvation my greatest tool
my voice saved my life my voice gave me
a life it gave me a purpose it showed me
a way out of the chaos of my home my
voice gave me a reason to push through
my pain and push through my fears oh and
there were many my voice is my greatest
gift in what I like to call my tool
chest of life what&#39;s yours
you see because I believe the power of
our greatness lies in the very seed of
our being in our DNA I believe we are
born with it
every one of us born with our own unique
seed our own unique gift think back if
you can to a moment in time you can
remember ever being noticed recognized
even admired for something you did
something you did really well something
you created or achieved that was very
special you shared it with others that&#39;s
a gift now those of us who spent time
with their gifts we planted our seeds we
watered them we nurtured them we put
them in the best light and over time
these seeds sprouted they rooted they
grew branches and they blossomed these
roots are the foundation of our life&#39;s
purpose the blossoms bear the fruits of
our dreams so was I born with a voice
was I born with a gift
or was it just my time both a radio was
the first gift that I can remember ever
getting from my father some kids got
baseball&#39;s basketballs dolls
I got a transistor radio it had one
music station WABC New York oh yeah the
music they played on that station moved
me so much
I sang along people liked it when I sang
along they said you&#39;re good and that
felt good so I got better so much better
in fact that by the time I was five
years old and in kindergarten they moved
me up to the sixth grade choir and gave
me the solo I sang every day after that
asked my parents the music became the
loving arms I so needed the voices were
my best friends and the songs a safe
place for me to go I planted my seed and
over time my voice blossomed as my
life&#39;s purpose rooted I was recognized
and success came as my honed my skills I
sharpen my tool a voice is a very
powerful tool so is a gift for numbers a
gift for languages a gift for sharing
ideas do you know that every single I&#39;ve
ever released has the word love or heart
in the title tell it to my heart prove
your love I&#39;ll always love you every
beat of my heart send me a lover love
will lead you back can&#39;t get enough of
your love baby I mean Here I am singing
to the world about love and loss and
breakups and makeups and I&#39;ve never even
been married
I mean I&#39;ve never even been engaged
what&#39;s wrong with this picture
fear what is love don&#39;t hurt me don&#39;t
hurt me no more my father my brothers my
lovers give me Russell Crowe in
Gladiator powerful strong fighting for
his family his honor what a man what a
man what a man what a mighty good man or
Mel Gibson in brave heart hounded heroic
battling nations to avenge the death of
his young murdered bride or Brad Pitt in
legends of the fall
[Applause]
beautiful tortured and you can see why
birds suddenly appear every time you are
new just like me they long to be close
to you
and there it is right there in Burt
Bacharach song my why why I&#39;ve so long
to be close to men my first love my
father was a very tortured man and not
in a beautiful Brad Pitt way but in a
very ugly explosive and violent way
unable to control his anger and his rage
my father tore through our home daily
yelling screaming and hitting his inner
struggle to provide and protect for his
family tortured him my parents grew up
very aware of struggle they were
first-generation children of Holocaust
surviving parents so survival and
struggle they knew very well but our
home was not often filled with joy and
laughter but more often tears and fear
my father would rage we would hide and
my mother was his perfect victim so
you&#39;re no good cuz you&#39;re a heartbreaker
you&#39;re a liar and you&#39;re a cheat where
was my knight in shining armor where was
my hero who is my gladiator my father
he&#39;s too busy battling his own inner
demons but there were those late nights
when he would come home after his rage
ran its course he would quietly come up
the stairs and come into my room and
he&#39;d kneel beside my bed and he&#39;d weep
he would reach his hand out into the
dark and touch my hair and pet it and
say I&#39;m so so sorry honey I&#39;m so so
sorry do you know that do you really
want to hurt me do you really want to
make me cry you&#39;re so special you&#39;re so
special to me honey you&#39;ve know that do
you know that do I know that I know love
hurts love scars love wounds and love
marks but yes I did know I was special
because I had a gift
I had a seed and by six years old I knew
I would plant my seed and I would
survive
cuz I&#39;m young I know a thing or two but
I learned it all from you I learned it
all from you love is like a flame it
burns you where and it&#39;s through cuz
love hurts if my parents couldn&#39;t
protect me my voice would
I was just a little girl living in my
lonely world when I heard that song
little girl hold on ma cherie oh ma
in the chaos of my home from the voice
to call my own just a melody except my
saw Sophie gave home back to me
