in 1785 in an elementary school in Lower
Saxony on a lazy afternoon a teacher
said his students busy work some all the
numbers he said from one to a hundred
and settled back to enjoy his paper but
after only a minute one student raised
his hand and announced the solution 5050
the cleverest child had seen that every
pair of numbers in the series say one to
a hundred two and 99 adds up to 101 and
that there are fifty such pairs the
inventor of this little trick was carved
Friedrich Gauss who would grow up to
become the greatest mathematician since
antiquity and the formula works for all
series of numbers that are evenly spaced
when we talk about how technology can
solve big problems we often borrow this
language of mathematics we hope for
insights like Gauss&#39;s which provide a
shortcut or a breakthrough in the jargon
of Silicon Valley we want disruptions
technological innovations that appear
like miracles and displace tired ways of
doing things often by competing on price
but in the real world technological
solutions are not so easily won because
big problems are civilizational and they
are hard so here&#39;s a more difficult
problem that humanity did solve the
ozone layer of the stratosphere absorbs
around 97% of the sun&#39;s ultraviolet
radiation without its cl√©ment umbrella
we&#39;d get cancers in 1970 for acting on a
hint from the environmentalist James
Lovelock
two chemists named Sherwood Rowland and
Mario Molina
predicted a depletion of the ozone
caused by our own technologies the
chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs used in
refrigerators air conditioning systems
and aerosols they said that CFCs would
rise high enough into the solar
radiation that the solar radiation would
split off a chlorine atom
react with the ozone destroying the
ozone layer in few years later
scientists confirmed the hypothesis and
then observed a huge decrease in ozone
around the poles holes but in 1976 the
National Academy of Sciences endorsed
Rowland emillionaires Molina&#39;s
hypothesis over the objections of
industry and in 1978 Norway the US and
Canada banned the use of CFCs in aerosol
sprays and since 1987 197 countries have
signed the Montreal Protocol which
committed the world of phasing out CFCs
when we look at the world there are
evils that seem to survive
identification as evils like
environmental degradation and goods that
we know are good that we cannot embrace
that&#39;s because the changes can seem too
much or they come too quickly or they
are unbearable to contemplate but in the
case of CFCs we were able to act why
well first although the science was
incredibly complicated it was
incontrovertible the impact of CFCs was
confirmed within a decade an industrial
opposition to its regulation collapsed
second of all our institutions were able
to devise and impose strong and rational
commitments third we already had
technological alternatives or we could
quickly create them and finally the
politics of the time were right the
public could grasp the idea of a hole in
the stratosphere and politicians found
some personal or party benefit in
supporting national laws and
international Accords since I spoke to
solve two Ted three years ago about how
technology can solve big problems I&#39;ve
been doing just that I&#39;ve been building
an organization and at MIT called solve
which seeks to discover evaluate and
advance solutions to big technological
problems I&#39;ve discovered that conditions
similar to Montreal must exist for there
to be
furgus we must understand the problem
institutions must provide leadership and
rational policies entrepreneurs and
Industry must find in labs technologies
that they can test develop and
manufacture at scale and politicians and
the general public must actually care to
solve the problem much of the work of
solve has been done against the dark
background hum of the great challenge of
our own day climate change but the
problem of climate change is much harder
than the depletion of the ozone by CFCs
it&#39;s it&#39;s wickedly hard once again the
culprits our own technologies but this
time they are foundational they are the
hydrocarbons we burn to fuel our
technological civilization but which
contribute to the greenhouse effect at
more than 400 parts per million of co2
in the atmosphere and enormous reserves
of fossil fuels some part of which we
will use at least two degrees of global
warming once thought the limit of what
we could bear now seems baked in and
more as possible it will be hotter the
sea levels will rise and flood cities
and towns there will be more droughts
and storms and crops will fail the
nations will fight and refugees will
stream from the poorer parts of the
world faced with all this it&#39;s very easy
to lose heart but it&#39;s never over until
it&#39;s over and life goes on until it
doesn&#39;t we have to decide what we want
to do next in short don&#39;t panic we have
to don&#39;t panic in short we need to begin
to investigate the portion of climate
change that is genuinely not well
understood including climate sensitivity
which will tell us how bad it will all
be and how fast it will happen we need
to swiftly replace fossil fuels with the
clean energy technologies we do possess
such as solar and wind while researching
and developing solutions that still
elude us like how will we store
electricity generated from into
Mitton sources such as solar and wind
and how will we build cheaper safer
nuclear reactors we will have to imagine
the economic the agricultural and the
engineering implications of a hotter
future and plan accordingly
all of this will require smart energy
policies including a price on carbon and
a substantial increase in how much
nations spend on energy R and E
technology which has expanded human
possibilities and grown wealth can also
create problems like global warming
under certain conditions technology can
solve those problems but there are no
miracles we have to want the solutions
and cheerfully accept that the solving
won&#39;t be easy thank you
