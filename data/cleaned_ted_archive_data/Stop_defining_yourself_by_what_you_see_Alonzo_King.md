hello greetings to all of you if we are
serious about not wasting time in the
short sojourn that we have on planet
earth then we need to find out who and
what we really are as quickly as
possible most of the ways that we define
ourselves in terms of age race sex
occupation geographical location
religion they&#39;re too small because what
we are is much larger than any of those
definitions and in a true since most of
us are suffering from some degree of
identity best identification is built
from two Italian words piccata to make
any dent a saying to make the same and
so where we concentrate where we put the
mental focus of our minds what we&#39;re
thinking about every day and night in
terms of what we are what definition we
think we are that&#39;s what we become and
those titles are too small in art making
when you have the ability to remove
yourself from your personal story the
playing field becomes huge and the
possibilities are limitless choices an
ending Helen Keller
that she was not able to liberate
herself until she realized that her body
was not herself when that realization
occurred
she said doors internal doors begin to
swing open intuitions Spectrum&#39;s
a largeness that she stepped into that
changed her life and in the end of her
life she said I found joy she was deaf
dumb blind and brilliant that&#39;s all of
us that&#39;s each and every one of us the
true meaning of the term genie in the
bottle is just that it is the genie
genius that is trapped in the physical
bottle of the body and it&#39;s dying to get
out it&#39;s dying to be released that&#39;s all
of us
our life force our spirit is bursting to
get out of those confines of the limited
physical form and that is what creation
and creativity is all about the one
becoming the everyone the individual
merging into the universal the
individual dissolving into omnipresence
so if we&#39;re able to dis is disassociate
from the idea of limitation if we&#39;re
able to let go of the idea of the body
as the self if we&#39;re able to let go of
any diminutive Conscription as a
definition then we began to get glimpses
of who and what we really are and save
ourselves from incarnations of wasted
time thank you so much
you
