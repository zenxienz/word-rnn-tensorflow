most medicines in the world are first
developed and tested in America no
patience the problem with this is that
many things that work in one population
may not necessarily work in another
population so in two thousand there was
hope and excitement when the US
president at that time Bill Clinton
declared a victory for humanity and
genetics were saying today within the
brace the revelation of the first draft
of the human book of life but the
reality is there is no single human book
of life there is no single human genome
so here we are 14 years later still
missing genetic data from all parts of
the world seventh one percent of the
genetic data available right now Afro
Americans and Europeans now that means
practical sense of all the available
genetic data are from eighty percent of
the world&#39;s population and only ten
percent of all the available genetic
data are from Africans yet Africa is the
origin of all human beings now that
means the origin of each of your genes
can be kissed back to your answer cells
in Africa so to understand the genetics
of all human populations we must start
from Africa because Africa is also the
greatest genetic diversity here&#39;s
another reason why we must start from
Africa right now 75 cent 1% of HIV
positive patients live in sub-saharan
Africa but when developed medicines for
AIDS or any disease we first test them
in American vocations the problem with
that is that medicine that is safe for
the US may not be necessarily safe for
Africans
under those that is right for me here at
kenyon may not necessarily be right for
my friend over there from Nigeria let me
give you a real example if a variance is
a drug for the treatment of AIDS fifty
percent of Ugandan contain a genetic
mutation that is associated with
increased risk of headaches and business
to this drug now this drug will foster
said in Caucasian Americans where side
effects were lower if we add the
ventilator from the gundams we have
predicted higher side effects and
designed a more appropriate dose so I
came up with a solution the solution is
to create a comprehensive genetic data
means of all African populations and an
online educational platform to train
students on how to use that data now i&#39;m
launching that project today it&#39;s called
the United genomes project and it&#39;s
raised at that not medical school here
is a summary of how it&#39;s going to work
we are going to ask Africans living in
the u.s. to persuade in a study in which
will collect a million genetic data
points for each person then the
resulting data will be used to train
students all over Africa on how to
identify effective and safe medicines
and the data are also going to be open
on the web so anyone from Nigeria to
Namibia can learn and make discoveries
from them like I did in 2002 when I made
a potentially new discovery on HIV drug
resistance other time i&#39;ll just send
students at
digital University in a rural parts of
Kenya all i had was radical idea on HIV
and no love and for a dollar per hour I
went to cyber cafes and analyzed free
human DNA sequences on the web now all
over Africa the thousands of students
just like me who can do this and the
number of these students who are
brilliant but lack an opportunity is
increasing as the Internet becomes more
accessible now imagine the discoveries
that will come when these students begin
analyzing the data on our platform so
but fitting in this project will open a
new feature of Medicine pioneered in
Africa a future in which medicine is
more effective and safe because it is
fossilized one in which Africans on the
editor and Saturday destiny and sit of
the table as equal partners when drugs
are being developed or even develop
their own drugs this has never been done
before I invite you to join in this
mission thank you
so I just I just wanted to underline a
couple of things one is it this is a
world premiere today no one&#39;s ever heard
about this this is brand-new you can go
to United genomes org and learn more
about it that&#39;s right yes yeah okay and
then just I just want to as I recall
just taking the it&#39;s called efference is
that the dragon of fun begins if
everyone&#39;s right so for Ugandan fifty
percent of people were getting nauseous
or vomiting and so of course they didn&#39;t
want to take their medicine if they
didn&#39;t take their medicine and then they
get HIV resistant or resistant HIV and
then they can get AIDS and then they are
more likely to die right that&#39;s what
happened yes Slate&#39;s become butterfl
everyone as well right okay awesome well
thank you so much I really appreciate it
thank you
[Applause]
