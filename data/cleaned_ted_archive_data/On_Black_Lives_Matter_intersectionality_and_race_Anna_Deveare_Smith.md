Thank You sada Thank You scrapper so
I&#39;ve been going across the country since
2013 trying to learn what I can about
why so many poor kids can&#39;t make it
through school and very often end up in
the criminal justice system and I&#39;ve
been to town cities an Indian
Reservation I have talked to judges
teachers psychiatrists medicine women
neuro endocrinologists and certainly I
have had the opportunity to talk to some
of the youths themselves some of them
behind bars some of them in schools some
of them in their homes and some of them
in streets and so in trying to think
about what I might like to share with
you I decided I would share with you two
young people who I met in May in
Baltimore Maryland my hometown right
after the riots which followed as you
know the death of a young black man
named Freddie gray who was said to have
been killed while while in police
custody and I think by choosing these
young people you&#39;re going to see a
portrait of some of the things that
surround their lives and how some of
those things make it hard for them to
get through school now my process is
that I interview people and then I
represent them word for word so that&#39;s
what you&#39;re going to see and this first
person is a young lady named India
sledge I call this no music I like to
give titles to the things that people
have said to me and a lot of stuff was
going on
my boyfriend Jake was Lee reaches walk
into the store the police stepped him up
and threw him against the wall for no
reason checked him for no reason
after that his mom was like I gots to
get out of here cuz the only thing
around this area is dress drug dealers
drug dealers drug dealers and I think
that the police be messing with
instead of females I think this product
guys are hotter boys dress they don&#39;t
dress they dress appropriate outside
walking around with a page sagging still
wearing your pants how you post where
I&#39;m on you&#39;re behind men boys they wear
the pants low like down here yes yes
down here there yes they don&#39;t care
instead of wearing a belt
they don&#39;t wear a belt just walking
around with a pinch second set it on the
same corner police riding past I think
that&#39;s really why the police be missing
with the Mears instead of the females I
like a male that&#39;s doing something with
herself instead of just stunning on a
corner why are you just standing on the
corner what you gonna get out of that
you could be looking for a job
trying to get your high school diploma
because some probably didn&#39;t even
graduate a lot of boys when I was in
middle school our boys was doing their
working things now I see them I go like
whoo he just got out of jail
oh you selling drugs and you was doing
so good in school what happened I don&#39;t
know what it is some boys some man&#39;s
they like to be being down when I say
down mean as soon they see other boys
throwing things they want to do it being
down doing violence being down selling
drugs being down I know people&#39;s doing
good but now they&#39;re selling drugs
because their friend did it or their
cousin do it and that&#39;s some sin if
you&#39;re not selling drugs why you stunt
on the corner why are you standing on
the corner just stand on the corner just
hang again just hanging I walk past
sometimes they try to say things to me I
just ignore how you doing what&#39;s my name
what&#39;s my number come here when I&#39;m come
here for I don&#39;t have nothing
say to y&#39;all sometimes I&#39;ll be walking
down the street with my earphones on
they think I&#39;d be listening to music
buddy here and everything cuz that&#39;s one
thing my mother told me she said don&#39;t
be walking down the street just with
your earphones in your ear and your
music is loud and I cannot hear my
surroundings so sometimes I&#39;ll be
walking down the street in my earphones
and no music I just be walking I like to
be by the one I&#39;m walking and that&#39;s
India Sledge from Baltimore Maryland
and this young man is named Allen
Bullock he made the newspapers because
he was said to have demolished a police
car during the riots and his bail was
$500,000 which is what got him in the
news and he is here referring to an idea
that Freddie gray was killed because he
made eye contact with the police
officers and this is called big stick I
mean look the police way to tell you the
truth that&#39;s not even me
I don&#39;t even pay the police no mind if
they look at me I just turn my head if I
look back if I look back at y&#39;all not
gonna bug you I&#39;m just gonna look the
other way you fella that&#39;s all it is to
it cuz if you look at the police so hard
I throw straight I see how he was
Freddie gray in a way like around this
neighborhood it&#39;s the police the
neighborhood police know you in the
neighborhood they&#39;re gonna do something
to you it could be a quiet neighborhood
anything if they know you from being bad
or not even being bad hanging in the
earlier hanging with somebody that they
know just bad they gonna shoot and if
they rash you why are you looking at me
like that they won&#39;t ask you why you
looking at me like that in a smart way
jump out there Carl you feel me pulling
a stick and all that I don&#39;t had a
police ask me why am i walking in the
street why my across the street what you
mean why am i across the street I say
something back they jump out the car so
I&#39;ll get back up on the curb you feel me
there&#39;s no need for you to get out of
your car and your family and talk to me
you can see why I walk across the street
let me say excuse me sir come here none
of that but you just asked me why my
walk across the street if M it&#39;s not
late outside it&#39;s not none of that so
what do you know there&#39;s just a whole
lot of police out here being what they
do being police be smart
that&#39;s all I for saying you be smart
that&#39;s all it is to it I don&#39;t know what
you&#39;re doing if that&#39;s your hustle you
got something on you don&#39;t even pay the
police no mind don&#39;t even draw no
attention and even if you don&#39;t got
nothing on
I still don&#39;t expect you to draw no
attention to the police the police they
don&#39;t care even if you don&#39;t got nothing
on you why look at the police if you
ain&#39;t got no problem with the police why
mug the police offend me no reason at
all I don&#39;t pay the police out here no
mind I don&#39;t pay the police no mind they
mugged me all day I don&#39;t care about
none of that they do and I see them like
your family like my own hats he wants to
say to the police and all that we&#39;re
honest and that I&#39;m out here in these
streets or they beat me like four times
I remember four times only four times or
to use it what&#39;s the name of step
sometimes they use their hands it&#39;s
nothing you can say to protect yourself
on the police except run your mouth and
if you really run your mouth they go and
do something to you and if they chase
you and they catch you and you ain&#39;t got
nothing on you they really gonna make it
worth their while they&#39;re gonna beat you
straight it don&#39;t matter if they black
or white this ain&#39;t no black or white
situation I&#39;m trying to hear that I&#39;ve
seen plenty of black officers doing I&#39;m
black - black people I&#39;ve seen white
officers doing I see them do it together
it&#39;s saying no race thing this a hatred
thing what&#39;s the point of you locking me
up and beating me if you can&#39;t find
nothing on me why cuz I made you run
come on now you trained for that
oh no the hood police be hatin just hate
for people like hate for people like if
you see you have a cup eyelets in your
