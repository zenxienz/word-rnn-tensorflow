morning everyone it&#39;s great to be here
you know when I first saw the conference
program I was I was struggling with a
very important question it&#39;s better to
speak before or after the circus and and
I think I&#39;ve decided that it doesn&#39;t
matter it&#39;s just stuff to be here anyway
what I&#39;d like to talk about is the
importance of private capital and the
recent resurgence of economic growth in
sub-saharan Africa and the critical role
it can and needs to play of that
performances to continue and I&#39;d like to
do that by making a few points first a
major reason for the poor performance
we&#39;ve seen is the fact that we&#39;ve had we
have not had real private capital to
raise capital and by that I mean cattle
that demands an appropriate return on
its investment second we&#39;ve had abysmal
political leadership and to me what that
means is the private sector needs to
play an increasingly important role
third the recent performance of private
capital investment provides concrete
proof of its potential and points that
really points the way forward and
finally we often talk about reducing
poverty in Africa and to me that&#39;s a big
part of the problem the language that we
use I feel like the South Africa really
short we should be talking about is
wealth creation
I want to make Africans rich if you make
Africans rich then they&#39;ll be that&#39;s
poor that&#39;s my priority reduction side
at you and and I just that battle
that will probably sound a little
familiar to some of you from yesterday
so let me get started I&#39;d like to make
my first point by reviewing a little of
the performance Africa sub-saharan
Africa is at the bottom of the ranking
of the world&#39;s regions by GDP that&#39;s
true on an aggregate as well as a per
capita basis now as we heard yesterday
sub-saharan Africa it&#39;s a big place we
have 48 countries all of their own story
we have coastal countries landlocked
countries resource rich resource poor
Anglophone Franco flow and Rousseau
phone and every other kind of phone that
you can think of one of those stories is
out of South Africa which is really a
developed country hiding out in
sub-saharan Africa and yeah on its own
it makes up a little over a third of
sub-saharan Africa&#39;s GDP and it distorts
any analysis of the region so so what
I&#39;ve done is kind of excluded it and no
offense
till the South Africa is out there and
if we look at sub-saharan Africa without
Africa the numbers look even bleaker GDP
per capita of about six hundred
thirty-seven dollars when I talk about
Africa going forward I&#39;m really
referring to sub-saharan Africa
excluding South Africa numbers look
better on a purchasing power parity
basis which takes into consideration the
fact that prices are generally cheaper
in poorer countries now why is this the
case well if we look at the makeup of
GDP we see of all the regions Africa has
the low that the highest sectoral
contribution to agriculture the fact is
and you heard some of this from the
previous speaker that to a large extent
the the most of the economies in Africa
are largely agrarian and the roughly 40
percent contribution from industry is
actually misleading most of that is
natural resource extraction so really
what you have economies that that are
essentially pre-industrial so how did we
get here after all if we if we go back
to 1980 which is not that long ago
things didn&#39;t look that bad for Africa
Asia was about roughly nineteen hundred
dollars in GDP per capita essentially
Eastern Europe was at roughly fifteen
hundred dollars so they were within
striking distance fast-forward 20 years
later and GDP per capita and this isn&#39;t
constant $2,000 GDP per capita in Africa
is that wait for it roughly $1,000 a
foot four thousand dollars and cents to
do per set roughly 67 hundred dollars
hey I know the Africa story pretty well
but I have to admit this was actually a
surprising result for me I wasn&#39;t sure
whether to laugh or cry when I saw it
maybe if you have more cops into humor
it&#39;s actually kind of funny and I
actually did laughed for about a minute
when I saw it and it&#39;s partially
explained by the growth story if we if
we compare Asia to Africa we see that
Asia has outperformed Africa in each of
the last four decades it&#39;s not until
this decade that we start to see Africa
at performing Asia with growth rates in
excess of 5% if we compare to countries
that are actually kind of similar
similar
Nigeria Indonesia both oil exporting
population Giants you see the same
growth story being played out resulting
in pronounced divergence in GDP per
capita now the interesting thing about
this story is the fact that is it has
occurred in the context of significant
aid contributions to Africa over 400
billion dollars from the 60s through
2005 on top of that there&#39;s been 200
billion dollars in official debt lending
to African countries and this is not
counting that the large amount of I
don&#39;t know how much it is of private aid
that goes into Africa one of on the
flipside we&#39;ve seen very low investment
levels private investment levels less
than half that of other developing
regions and so the picture that we have
in Africa is one in which you have very
low cap private capital investment
because you have low foreign direct
investment and much of that is going to
national resource extraction you&#39;re
basically taking oil and mineral
resources out of the out of these
countries and very low domestic private
investment because of private wealth and
capital flight I think one of the others
because it&#39;s going to talk about this
what investment you do have is public
sector sector investment that&#39;s financed
by debt aid and revenues from resource
extraction that&#39;s what I call easy money
and easy money has a very low required
return on investment and what you get
when you have capital the lower quadrant
investment while you get low returns and
there have been studies that show that
return on investment in Africa is
actually lower than in any other region
in the country I mean in the world you
take away from me here is that we need a
lot more private capital in Africa much
more and this should be capital that
demands a high return on its investment
the public sector investment stories it
leads me to my next point and I&#39;d like
to make this by taking a look at a map
of the world political map of the world
going back to 1977 don&#39;t have a laser
pointer here but if we look at a map of
the world I&#39;m going to compare Asia and
Africa here we&#39;ll see that ok great
anyway Africa is here we go thank you ok
in the map blue is blue democracy red is
communism and yellow and white they&#39;re
all those calls in between is basically
everything short of full democracy and
if we compare for example the age that
so-called Asian Tigers South Korea down
here you have Taiwan over here
I think Singapore and I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s
Hong Kong over there and singapore over
there we see that they&#39;re all basically
non-democratic
a Africa is awash in yellow by the way
some of you may recognize this name we
just can&#39;t seem to get rid of some of
these guys and yeah to me this is
interesting because you know as we move
forward through time we see the same I
think when being played out mostly non
democratic regimes is getting bluer but
most of the countries are basically non
they become non democratic 1997 most of
the world is now in democracy and the
Asian Tigers that will move that way and
Africa is also looking a lot more blue
but the point here is that political
developments in Asia and Africa has
basically been the same so and if you by
the fact that the state plays a crucial
role in determining the direction and
performance of an economy then you have
to come to the conclusion that the only
difference the difference in performance
is due to differences in quality of the
leadership and to me that&#39;s a big part
of the problem basically what we&#39;ve had
in Africa is two kinds of leaders
morally bankrupt that&#39;s the kind who are
intent on lining their own pockets and
ideologically bankrupt that&#39;s the kind
where well intentioned but ultimately
misguided and so what&#39;s the solution
well I say if the politicals can&#39;t get
it right then they need to get out of
the way and let private capital get it
done if Africa is to move forward the
private sector has to take an
increasingly play increasingly assertive
role increasing private capital
investment will create a constituency
that has an economic stake in the
economic outcomes that&#39;s the only way
that we can get our political leaders to
listen to us
I want to talk now about the recent
performance of private capital as you
saw in one of the previous charts we&#39;ve
started to see increasing economic
growth in Africa that is resulted in in
gains in GDP per capita
I think that&#39;s directly related to the
fact that to the rise in use of mobile
phones as you can see fixed line
subscribers per thousand people in
Africa we&#39;ve been fairly steady over the
past 10 years or we&#39;ve seen a dramatic
rise in mobile subscribers in Africa and
I think that coincides almost exactly
with the increase in GDP per capita that
we&#39;re seeing this this actually you
could give an entire presentation on
just on this topic but I don&#39;t have the
time to do that
what I do want to talk about is how that
happened this chart shows you the
private investment in telecoms over the
past 10 years beginning in 2000 we
started to see dramatic investments in
improving investment in in telecom over
two billion dollars most years since
2000 most of that was most of that was
financed by corporates but private
institutional capital played a key role
and let me give you an example in 2001
when MTN the South African telecoms
company came to Nigeria they were
looking for local partners and one of
the partners that they found was a local
private equity fund called capital
Alliance cattle Alliance put together a
group of local investors and they
acquired a 25% stake in MTN Nigeria last
year a 7% stake was sold back to MTN for
350 million dollars valuing MTN Nigeria
at five billion dollars so basically we
went from 200 million dollars in market
capitalization to 5 billion dollars
that&#39;s the 90 percent return not bad in
any language
you&#39;ve seen this truck before so I&#39;m not
going to spend a lot of time on it
it&#39;s probably the third time you&#39;ve seen
it but it highlights for me what the
next big opportunity in in Africa is
power it&#39;s a dark continent let&#39;s look
at the numbers behind that map and one
of the things that we see on this map is
what I&#39;d call more of the Africa shuffle
that&#39;s a tendency in charts for Africa
to sort of move sideways rather rather
than up if this is electricity
consumption by region
comparing Asia to s to Africa a Africa
has been at roughly 150 kilowatt hours
per person for the you know past ten
years not much change to put that in
context I looked at my electricity bill
before I left the US and last month my
three-person household we used about 650
kilowatt hours another way to look at
this is in North America that this
number is actually 14,000 if I put that
on the chart you wouldn&#39;t even see the
sub-saharan Africa line so what needs to
be done well as we can see going back to
our sectoral investment chart there&#39;s
not investment in power is not tracked
for the investment in telecoms so we
need substantial investment in in power
to effectively do what was done in
telecoms to increase the the amount of
politics being generated and why is that
important industrialization which is
what Africa needs now is a hugely
energy intensive process and without
reliable supply of electricity it&#39;s not
going to happen in Africa and that&#39;s why
this is absolutely necessary how much
investment is needed well to get to a
thousand kilowatt hours which is
somewhere between some somewhere south
of where a Joe is right now Ike I did a
rough calculation you brought you need
about 600 million megawatt hours
of additional gender generation which is
about seventy thousand megawatts of
additional generation capacity now
before I I started I moved into private
equity I was investing in energy in the
US and we used to a rough number we used
to use was million dollars per megawatt
so to finance the investment that&#39;s
required we would need seventy billion
dollars in additional investment a huge
number but not inconceivable in the
context of what&#39;s been invested in
telecoms and the potential returns are
the same because of the amount of
private public generation that&#39;s are
currently occurring in Africa and the
substantial economic scale now let me
talk about sort of my business what
we&#39;re trying to do I&#39;m trying to raise
money to do some of the make some of
these investments private equity
fundraising in Africa has started to
increase substantially two billion
dollars last year and and a lot of this
is driven by the fact that that telecoms
sector has been so successful but we
need much more money and one of the
things that really gets me is the fact
that it&#39;s so difficult to raise private
capital for Africa and yet we have 30 to
35 billion dollars in aid going to
Africa now I don&#39;t have anything against
eight but I think the proportions are a
little whacked out I mean if there&#39;s 30
to 35 billion dollars in aid going to
ask it and we should be able to get at
least 5 to 10 billion dollars in private
capital what I think Bono&#39;s should be
doing is telling the g8 to set up a fund
of funds and give that money to Africans
or and if they don&#39;t trust Africans give
it to Europeans or whoever to go invest
in businesses in Africa let&#39;s create
jobs we can do that on top of a
the other thing that is interesting
about this is and this is talking about
private equity is the fact that a lot of
the money is going into mature companies
growth and expansion and buyouts and
this is another example of the of Africa
sort of you know skipping a phase I
don&#39;t think it&#39;s right here I think the
potential for venture capitals is
actually huge in Africa and there are
millions of entrepreneurs in in Africa
most of them will remain small but a
select few have the potential and
actually a few of them are here looking
to meet some of them but a select few
have the potential to become major
companies and I&#39;ll give you a perfect
example sell tell some of you have their
SIM cards
in 2001 that was essentially a startup
and had substantial backing from private
equity and it was sold in 2005 for 3.4
billion dollars and a lot of private
equity firms made a lot of money
EMPs Africa Infrastructure Fund for
example invested 50 million dollars and
made 200 215 million dollars that&#39;s the
potential for investing in entrepreneurs
at the earliest age in Africa and this
is what I think we should be we should
be seeing a lot a lot more of that I&#39;d
like to finish off with the opportunity
for wealth creation stock market
capitalization right now in Africa at
the end of 2005 was 39 billion dollars
that was about 10% of GDP interestingly
enough South Africa was about five
hundred sixty five billion 90% of the
sub-saharan African total and yet it
only makes up a third of GDP doesn&#39;t
make sense
so here&#39;s what I think is going to
happen on what needs to happen if Africa
just grows at 5% and we we we maintain
the same market capitalization to GDP
ratio we&#39;ll have a market capitalization
in 2010 of 50 billion dollars but if we
increase the market captivation ratio to
50 percent we&#39;ll have a market position
of 240 billion dollars creating
additional wealth of 200 billion dollars
now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about and
some of this is actually starting to
happen if you if we look at the Nigerian
stock market at the end of 2005 it had a
market capitalization of about 20
billion dollars today it&#39;s over 50
billion dollars and I&#39;ll give you an
example why there was a company in
Nigeria this company Nigeria that was
listed on stock on the stock market
called
jungle tier sugar this was a company
filed in 1978 by the Nigerian
entrepreneur who basically was importing
processed sugar into Nigeria in 2000 he
decided to move up the value chain you
know and that&#39;s what we need to do in
Africa so I can move up the value chain
and imported started importing raw sugar
and refining it in Nigeria today the
company is the largest sugar refiner in
the country and one of the largest in
the world
well 30 percent of the company was
listed on the Nigerian Stock Market at
four hundred fifteen million dollars
over 110,000 Niger and shareholders was
40% oversubscribed today that
415 initial four hundred fifteen million
dollars is worth one point six billion
dollars mr. mr. Dongo tea is I have just
one more one more thing to say I realize
that one of my time here
I think this wealth creation opportunity
and I said at the outset is really what
up what I want to talk about but it&#39;s
not about creating wealth for a few
people it&#39;s about creating wealth for
everyone and this is a wealth creation
party that everyone is invited to and if
you haven&#39;t yet received an invitation
I&#39;m issuing one to you now thank you
let&#39;s go
[Applause]
