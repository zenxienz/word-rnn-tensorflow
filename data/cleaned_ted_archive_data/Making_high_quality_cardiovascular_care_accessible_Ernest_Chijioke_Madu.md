here is a question who knows the answer
ye-yes up alright
false
I need people no one knows who thinks
that cardiovascular diseases kill more
people in Africa all right who thinks
they kill more people in the US about
even the answer is a resounding true
significantly more people die in Africa
from heart disease and things related to
that is a major emerging health threat
in Africa and if unchecked will weaken
already with infrastructure button the
economic situation and will cost social
crisis that will be very significant and
will have a negative impact on Africa&#39;s
development it is interesting that in
the United States the most significant
health care budget goes to
cardiovascular disease care whether is
private or public is not even there&#39;s no
comparison at all in Africa where it is
a major killer
it is totally ignored and that situation
cannot be right we must do something
about it health status of the nation
parallel development of that nation 17
million people die every year from heart
disease 32 million heart attacks and
strokes occur most of these is in
developing countries and the majority is
in Africa eighty-five percent of global
disease burden for cardiovascular
disease is in developing countries not
in the West and yet 90% of the resources
are in the West who is at risk people
like you is not just the Africans that
she&#39;ll be concerned about that or
Friends of Africa that will have reason
to be in Africa at some point in time
she&#39;ll be very concerned about this
deplorable situation has anyone here
wondered what will happen if you go back
to your room at night and you start
getting chest pains shortness of breath
sweating you&#39;re having a heart attack
what are you going to do will you fly
back to the US
Germany Europe no you will die
50% will die within 24 hours if not
treated Naaman came from Scotland to
Jamaica and he was stricken fortunately
there was a process and he&#39;s alive and
well this is what&#39;s going on people
survive in a look at the map of the US
the graph here 10 billion people here 10
million people here by the time you get
to 50 it&#39;s almost no one left in Nigeria
life expectancy is 47 it&#39;s not because
some people don&#39;t survive childhood
illnesses they do but they do not
survive after the time that they reach
about 45 years old and 50 years old and
those are the times they&#39;re most
productive those are the times that they
should be contributing to Africa&#39;s
development but they are not there the
best way to spiral into a cycle of
poverty is to kill the parents if you
cannot secure the parents you cannot
guarantee the security of the African
child what are the risk factors is very
well known I&#39;m not going to spend a lot
of time on those these are just for
information hypertension diabetes
obesity lack of exercise the usual
suspects right here in Tanzania sapphic
percent of individuals have hypertension
20% are getting treated only less than
1% adequately treated if we can treat
hypertension alone in Africa will save
250,000 lives a year that&#39;s quite
significant easy to treat look at the
situation and more issues in eight short
years we&#39;re here talking about HIV
malaria which is all good we cannot make
the mistakes we&#39;ve made with malaria and
HIV in eight short years non
communicable diseases will become the
leading causes of death in Africa that
is something to keep in mind we can&#39;t
deal with it with situations like this
this is a typical African Hospital you
know say Hashim slides on this don&#39;t
want to waste too much time on it we
can&#39;t depend on the elites they go to
USA Germany UK for treatment
unbelievable you can&#39;t depend on foreign
aid alone here is the situation
countries are turning inwards first 9/11
the United States has had a lot of
trouble to deal with their own internal
issues so they spend their money trying
to fix those problems
you can&#39;t rightly it&#39;s not their
responsibility it is my responsibility I
have to take care of my own problems
if they help that&#39;s good but that is not
my expectation
these worsening indices of health care
or health status in Africa demand a new
look we cannot keep on doing things the
way we&#39;ve always done them if they have
not worked we have to look for
alternative solutions I&#39;m here to talk
to you about solutions this has been
what has been of deep concern to some of
us several years ago we started thinking
about it everyone knows the problem no
one knows what the solutions are we
decided that we need to put our money
where our mouth is everyone is ready to
throw in money in terms of three morning
aid to developing countries talk about
sustainable investment no one is
interested you can&#39;t raise money I have
done businesses and health care in the
United States I live in Nashville
Tennessee health care capital of America
very easy to raise money for health care
adventures but start telling them you
know we&#39;re gonna try to do it in Nigeria
everyone runs away that is totally wrong
those of you in the audience that you
want to help Africa invest money in
sustainable development let me lead you
through a day in the life of the Heart
Institute so you get a glimpse of what
we do and I&#39;ll talk a little bit more
about it
[Music]
I&#39;ve been around this world in a lot of
places see them here you&#39;re on faces in
a thousand but when I listen to you
around and move around me different
and I&#39;ve been wanting to tell you I&#39;m
never one on it even though it may be
winter but when I&#39;m feeling would you be
be faster if I asked you
[Music]
this what we have done is to show that
high quality health care comparable to
the best anywhere work can be done in a
developing country environment we have
25 physicians right now all of them
trained board-certified in the USA
Canada or Britain we have every modality
that can be done in Vanderbilt Cleveland
Clinic everywhere in the US and we do it
for about ten percent of the cost that
you will need to do those things in the
United States additionally we have a
policy that no one is ever turned away
because of ability to pay
we take care of everyone whether you
have one dollar two dollars it doesn&#39;t
matter and they will tell you how we are
able to do it
we make sure that we select our
equipment properly we go for modular
unit units that are multi modality
functions have modular components easy
to repair and because of that we do not
take things that are not durable and
cannot last we emphasize training and we
make sure that this process is
regenerative very soon we will all be
dead and gone
but the problems will stay unless we
have people taking over from where we
stopped we make sure that we produce
something ourselves we do not buy unit
doses of radio pharmaceuticals we get
the generators from the companies we
manufacture them in-house ourselves that
keeps the cost down so for
radiopharmaceutical in the u.s. that you
will get a unit dose for two hundred and
fifty dollars when we finish
manufacturing it in-house we come at a
price of about two dollars
we recognize that the only way to bridge
the gap between the rich and poor
countries is through education and
technology all these problems we are
talking about if we bring development
they will all disappear technology is a
great equalizer
how do we make it work it improves
health care is cost-effective it extends
opportunity to the rural centers and we
can use expertise in a very smart way
this is the way our centers are set up
we currently have three locations in the
Caribbean and we&#39;re planning a fourth
one and we have now decided to go into
Africa we will be doing the West African
Heart Institute in porticos Nigeria that
project will be starting within the next
few months we hope to open in two
thousand and eight or nine and we will
do order centers this model can be
adapted to every disease process all the
units are the centers are linked through
a switch hub to a central server and all
the images are populated to review
structures and we designed this
telemedicine solution is propria to us
and we are happy to share what we have
learned with anyone who is interested in
doing it you can still be profitable we
make sure that the telemedicine platform
gives access to expert medical
specialists anywhere in the world just
by a click at the bottom and I only need
to to see how this happens this is at
the Heart Institute the doctors from
anywhere can log-in I can call you in
Switzerland and say listen go into our
system look at mrs. Jones look at the
study tell me what you think and they&#39;ll
give me that information and we&#39;ll make
the care of the patient better the
patient doesn&#39;t have to travel it
doesn&#39;t have to experience the anxiety
of not knowing because of limited
expertise we also use electronic medical
record system I&#39;m happy to say that the
things we have implemented 80% of us
practice
do not have them and yet the technology
is there but you know they have that
luxury because if you can&#39;t get it in
Nashville you can travel to Birmingham
two hours and where you get it if you
can&#39;t get it in Cleveland you can go to
Cincinnati we don&#39;t have that luxury
so we have to make it happen when we do
it we will put the cost of care down and
we&#39;ll extend it to the rural centers and
make it affordable and everyone will get
the care they deserve it cannot just be
technology we recognize that prevention
must be part of the solution we
emphasize that but you know you have to
tell people what can be done it&#39;s not
possible to tell people to do what is
going to be expensive and the government
can&#39;t do it they need to be alive they
need to feed we recommend exercise is
the most effective simple easy thing to
do we have had worked every year every
March April we have works sponsored
Emancipation Park we form people into
groups and make them go into challenges
which group loses the most weight we
give them prizes which groups record
more working distance by pedometer we
give them prizes we do this constantly
we encourage them to bring children that
way we start exposing the children from
very early on on what these issues are
because once they learn it they will
stay with it in doing this we have
created at least 100 skilled jobs in
Jamaica alone and these are physicians
with expertise and special training we
have taken care of
over 1,000 indigent patients that could
have died including for free pacemakers
in patients with complete heart block
for those that understand cardiology
complete heart block means certain death
if you don&#39;t get this pacemaker you will
be dead so we&#39;re pleased with that
indirectly we have saved the government
of Jamaica
five million dollars from people that
would have gone to Miami for our Atlanta
for care and we&#39;ve hopefully saved a lot
of lives by the end of this year we
would have contributed over 1 million
dollars in indigent care
the first four months is when three
$40,000 average in 85,000 dollars a
month the government will not do that
because they have completed needs they
need to put resources elsewhere but we
can still do it because people say how
can you do that this is how we can do
that in the period we&#39;ve been there at
least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that we are
heading to Miami for treatment have
self-confessed that they did not go to
Miami because of the Heart Institute of
the Caribbean and if they went to Miami
they will spend significantly more x2 10
times more and they feel happy spending
it at home getting the same quality of
care and for that money for every one
patient that has the money to pay it
gives us opportunity to take care of at
least four people that do not have the
resources to pay
[Applause]
for this to work this progress must be
sustainable so we emphasize training
training is critical we have gone
further we have formed a relationship
with the University of Technology
Jamaica we&#39;re not have an appointment
and we are starting a biomedical
engineering program so that we will
train people locally who can repair
those equipment that way we&#39;re not going
to deal with obsolescence and all those
kind of issues we are also starting
ancillary healthcare technology training
programs training people in e-coat
echocardiography cadet officer and those
kind of things now with that kind of
training it gives people motivation
because now they will get a bachelor&#39;s
degree medical imaging and all those
kind of stuff in the process I want you
to just hear from the trainees
themselves what it has meant for them an
adjacent Toppin I am a senior agent in
anesthesia intensive care at the
University Hospital in the West Indies I
came to the Heart Institute in 2006 as
part of my elective in my anesthesia
intensive care program I expect three
months at the Heart Institute
there has been no doubt around my
colleagues about the utility of the
training I received here and I think
there&#39;s been an increased interest now
in particularly in echocardiography and
it seems in our setting in x-ray
technician I am an echocardiogram at the
Heart Institute of the Caribbean since
the past two years I received training
at this institution I think this aspect
of training in cardiology that the Heart
Institute of the Caribbean has
introduced in Jamaica is very important
in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases
the lesson in this is that it can be
done and it can be sustained and you can
make it possible for everyone who are we
to decide that poor people cannot get
the best care
when have you been appointed to play God
it is not my decision my job is to make
sure that every person no matter what
faith have assigned to you you will have
the opportunity to get the best quality
health care in life next stop is West
African Heart Institute that we are
going to be doing in Port Harcourt
Nigeria as I said before we will do
order centers across West Africa we will
extend the same system into other areas
like dialysis treatment we will do it
with and anyone who is interested in
doing it in any healthcare situation we
will be happy to assist you and tell you
how we&#39;ve done it and how you can do it
and if we do this we can change the face
of healthcare in Africa Africa as we do
to us it is time for us to give back to
Africa I am going those who want to come
I welcome you to come along with me
thank you
[Applause]
the
I mean this is this is it as an annus
isn&#39;t the future of african healthcare
depends on how many people like you have
this determination to come back and
innovate and do this I mean are there
more like you who you know can you see
this changing yes I can see I&#39;m very
hopeful it what has happened is you know
top is cheap it is very easy to talk but
doing it and but we cannot focus on the
difficulties in getting it done
everything that is what&#39;s doing
sometimes can be very difficult to do
but I think with more and more people
doing it others that have been thinking
about it will become more committed to
taking the risk to do it so I hope that
as this talk goes out on the internet
that as many of your peers as possible
and the Diaspora will see it and will
see that you know there is I mean
there&#39;s really as far as I&#39;m concerned a
hero&#39;s welcome to be had for people who
can figure out how to take what they&#39;ve
learned and and bring it back to address
problems back home and I&#39;m inspired by
your story thank you so much thank you
[Applause]
