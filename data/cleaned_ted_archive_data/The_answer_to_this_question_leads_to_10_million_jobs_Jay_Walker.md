for many of you that are here for the
first time at EDD one of the exciting
things about Ted is the power of the Ted
community and what we mean by the power
of the Ted community is that the people
in this room have enormous capacity
working together to solve problems to
create new relationships to invent
things and so I&#39;m going to talk for just
a few minutes here about an opportunity
for the Ted community to do something
right now this week together to solve a
problem and that problem is we&#39;re going
to figure out a solution to a puzzle and
I know most of you in this room have
spent your life solving puzzles so this
is going to be fun like a crossword
puzzle only a little bit more important
because if we solve this puzzle together
in the Ted community we can create 10
million jobs that&#39;s the prize for
solving this puzzle 10 million jobs so
how are we going to do that well the
first thing you need to know about jobs
is that capital tools create jobs if you
have a capital tool almost always you
have a job for example if you have a
sewing machine anybody argue you&#39;ve got
a job almost anybody can learn to sew
and can make money if they have a sewing
machine the classic example of a capital
tool that creates jobs is a bicycle if
you have a bicycle and we see the
streets here in Arusha you&#39;ve got a job
because we could imagine 500 different
jobs that a single bicycle could perform
and you don&#39;t need a lot of training to
operate a bicycle so what is the
greatest capital tool ever created in
this century what is the number-one
capital tool that is everywhere in
Africa this capital tool is being sold a
billion times this year here it is this
is a capital tool this is a bicycle this
is a sewing machine this is a job the
only question is what&#39;s the job now
talking on the phone is not a job
and selling phone time is a job but not
a billion not ten million of them
the real question here is if you have a
billion of these you&#39;ve got a billion
buyers of a service because all I need
to do to buy the service is to open the
phone dial a phone number and purchase
the service what&#39;s nice about it it has
a billing platform built in so you don&#39;t
have to worry about how you&#39;re going to
build for it now the question is if I
call somebody who&#39;s human and speaks
English what can they do what job can
they perform that I in the West or
anybody would be willing to pay for so
in the remaining 20 seconds here&#39;s just
a few that don&#39;t work but are
interesting starting points somebody
could tell a lullaby to put a baby to
sleep how about tell a story how about
tell a joke how about listen or
monitored or something about interpret
something about translate how about
practicing some language practicing
French Spanish English any of those
things could be a job on the phone so
I&#39;m out of time but I&#39;m going to be
walking around my name is Jay Walker and
I&#39;m looking for anybody and everybody to
come up here and tell me what job could
somebody perform if all they had was a
cell phone and could speak English no
training nothing else we can pay them
over the cell phone by crediting their
account with minutes and we can collect
from the others all right let&#39;s figure
out the job as a TED community thank you
very much
