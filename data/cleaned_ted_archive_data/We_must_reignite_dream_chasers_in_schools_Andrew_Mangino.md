good evening
so I admit I got very excited when I
heard the theme of tonight was not
education reform or reimagine ation but
revolution I have the weird honor of
being one of the only people I think in
the country who both graduated from high
school and sued their high school all in
about the same week now this was a
little this was a little out of
character for me to say the least going
all the way back to kindergarten when I
was in playing with blocks with my
friends I was trying to ace every test
please every teacher get a hundred on
everything I possibly could I considered
it the crowning achievement of my
childhood went in the first semester of
my senior year I beat out my best friend
by 1/10 of a decimal point to become the
class valedictorian it was a very sad
existence and then something happened
our high school principal censured our
newspaper now by this time I was already
into college and like all of my friends
and so the game of high school was kind
of over and so we looked at each other
and we said are we gonna do something
about this we said we&#39;ve got to we&#39;ve
got to do something about this we had
nothing to lose at this point and so we
took a stand and we said you know what
you&#39;ve got a you&#39;ve got to let us talk
about in this case an article critical
of the school&#39;s curriculum which the
principal said had no place in a public
forum he said it was quote antithetical
to the school&#39;s pedagogical mission to
discuss such things and so much to my
mom&#39;s horror we hired the ACLU we got a
lawyer this guy with a very long beard
and a picket line protest singing band
and we serve papers to our high school
we said we&#39;re not going to take this
then just to continue the trend that
week in my high school graduation speech
at the last second I decided that I was
going to give a passionate passionate
case again
class rank declaring that the entire
system that had put me on top was a
complete lie then I broke out at the end
of my speech into a full-on highly
tone-deaf rendition of can you feel the
love tonight it was not what
valedictorian was supposed to do some
people said I was losing it
how was having fun I had realized that
this little game that we were playing
was kind of a lie or at least it was
very incomplete and I realized something
in that moment that I am now on a
mission to cause every single young
person in the country to realize -
before it&#39;s too late that just about
everything we&#39;re taught about success is
dead wrong schools schools look at
success too often as acquiring
memorizing information that you could
just look up on Google
beating out your peers putting up making
others small so that you can rise on top
so you can get the higher grade
following the rules but life looks that
success so differently if you think
about it life looks at success has been
curious and not acquiring information
but applying information to creatively
solve really difficult problems life
looks at success as collaborating with
peers inspiring them bringing them up so
together you can do something bigger
than you could ever do alone life looks
at success as actually breaking the
rules questioning every assumption and
when needed when you find something
that&#39;s not working deciding to change it
to reinvent it I believe that all of us
who have come here tonight already know
this
over the last decade something really
significant has happened we&#39;ve kind of
awakened as a society to the fact that
schools are defining success that are
very antiquated or incomplete way there
we know that there is a global education
crisis of foot so tonight I don&#39;t want
to talk to you about the problem I
we all kind of get it instead want to
talk to you about the solution and about
the possibility that that solution could
be simpler than we may have thought our
contention is that everything could
change if schools suddenly began to
instead of inspiring and challenging
students to achieve a diploma challenged
them to achieve big dreams imagine if
every student were challenged to achieve
something that truly matters to them
a passion a purpose imagine if students
graduated having in some small specific
but transformational way changed the
world this is a mission that I&#39;m not on
alone over the past few years thousands
of us have come together across the
whole country to do something about this
we call ourselves the future project and
we are now working with young people
from San Francisco to Detroit from
Philadelphia to Newark from New Haven to
Washington DC - right here in New York
City we are working with young people
who are amazing me every single day by
the incredible projects that they build
when they realize that they actually
have it in them to achieve incredible
things students like Kayla Marte Kayla
Marte grew up in East Harlem and she
went to a school right around the block
from here that had been called a failing
school now this may have been true but
what she realized it was a brilliant
insight was that the students in her
school were suddenly marking themselves
as failures as a result of this the
state had almost given up on them she
decided she had to do something about
this so she lodged protests she
assembled with friends a group of people
to stage rallies she ended up with an
article in The New York Times and she
failed because that&#39;s what happens
sometimes when you go out and pursue big
dreams and that&#39;s exactly the point
but she stood back up and she came up
with something even better something
called restart day she brought her
entire school together and said no
matter what&#39;s going on with what the
government says we are all going to
decide to restart our school culture
she brought a motivational speaker she
had students share their most vulnerable
thoughts she had students make new
commitments to the future of their
dreams even if they felt hopeless it was
transformational she was so inspiring as
she did this and now she&#39;s on a mission
to restart the cultures of failing
schools all across the country
she continued this journey last year by
interning for the federal Department of
Education she wants to be the Secretary
of Education one day students
[Applause]
young dreamers like D&#39;Angelo Hughes
inspired me as well
D&#39;Angelo when he was just 15 years old
growing up in the east side of Detroit
experienced unthinkable tragedy in his
life by that time in his life his mother
had passed away from a long illness he
had lost his brother in essence to a
lifelong sentence in prison
another of his brothers had been
murdered there were moments where
D&#39;Angelo didn&#39;t even know why he was
living let alone in school then he was
inspired one day by another student
Renick a-- here in new york city who
also had suffered loss and created
something called flutter so he decided
to start a flutter chapter in Detroit
now D&#39;Angelo is on a mission to ensure
that every single young person because
he realized this this problem was not
being solved in his community has a
support group when they suffer
overwhelming grief just six weeks ago
D&#39;Angelo filed his 501 C 3 papers and
now he&#39;s on a mission to bring flutter
to all of Detroit and I&#39;ve got a
surprise for you Kayla and D&#39;Angelo are
here in the audience tonight
I love these stories I love these
stories and the thousands more of young
people who create books make films start
documentaries create movements in their
schools start clubs that start turning
around elements of their school create
plays that cause students to start
expressing themselves in new ways build
products the list goes on and on and on
because there are infinite passions in
the world that young people when they&#39;re
fully inspired in school can pursue
these students most excitingly don&#39;t
just do this for themselves they become
agents of inspiration for their peers
until students all throughout their
school are following their example but
the thing that I really love talking
about is the how of all of this what we
started the future project we asked
ourselves a different kind of question
about the solution we we were inspired
by examples of new schools that have
been created by sweeping policy changes
that had been made but we were impatient
and we said how could we create
something that once we kind of really
got it right could scale to not just
every high school in this country but
ultimately every school in the world
period because the scale of the problem
we&#39;re talking about is billions and
billions of young people so we realized
as we did this investigation working
with our students in our first year that
the core cast of characters had not been
reinvented in school
truly since the guidance counselor more
than a century ago so we did the only
thing we know how to do we invented a
new profession called the dream director
the dream director was inspired by Willy
Wonka Mary Poppins Martin Luther King
Harriet Tubman the most exciting
inspirational teacher or coach or mentor
or leader you&#39;ve ever witnessed who&#39;s
ever made a difference for you we said
what do you get packaged all this
together in one human being what if you
could put those human beings in schools
all across the world not just to unlock
the potential of young people
but also of guidance counselor&#39;s of
custodians in that school of teachers of
the principle these dream directors are
now in schools from coast to coast but
what&#39;s most exciting to me is the
response has been overwhelming and far
more than we ever realized it could be
we now have thousands of people who are
saying they want to be dream directors
for the rest of their lives we have
young people who are saying they want to
aspire to be a dream director when they
grow up we have teachers in almost all
50 states now who have said they want to
bring the methodology of dream directing
to their classroom because this is why
they got into teaching and education in
the first place we have schools who are
beginning to put passion and purpose in
the achievement of big dreams as
requirements as the point of graduating
because this is what makes for a great
great life and tonight I&#39;m excited to
announce that by the end of this year we
will be launching a website fittingly
called dream org where any young person
and any school in the world can access a
dream director we believe that this is a
big deal because if you think about it
thank you Lisa no we&#39;ll have one one
visitor to the site
dream dark what does either hear it so
this is a big deal we think because
because we are facing it something call
this but we are facing we think a dream
depression in this country it&#39;s not like
the Great Depression where people put
money under their mattress it&#39;s the
dream depression they&#39;re putting
something that matters even more to them
under the mattress their dreams young
people for the first time in America&#39;s
history the statistics are showing don&#39;t
believe just consider this for a moment
don&#39;t believe that the future will be
better than today this is unconscionable
and the source of it we believe is not a
person not an educator you can&#39;t blame
anyone no politician it&#39;s a system and
it&#39;s a system we all have the chance to
change together it&#39;s the school system
which programs young people to pursue a
vision of success that is not aligned
with true success in life we teach
algebra but not the art of aspiration
and then we wonder when we all have so
much trouble dreaming beyond our
circumstance we teach students how to
critically think but then we ask them to
apply that critical thinking to passages
on tests as opposed to real problems in
their community and we wonder why the
world seems so stuck we tell students
that the biggest accomplishment they can
have growing up is getting that diploma
as opposed to figuring out something
that truly matters to them a big dream
and even if it&#39;s gonna take some trial
and error and many many mistakes and
overcoming so much hardship achieving a
really really big dream and then we
wonder why so much of so many of us
later in life feel like we never really
lived never really pursued the biggest
dreams that matter to us I think that we
can do better I think that tonight we
can do better all of us in our own ways
can step up as dream directors we can
think of that young person who we know
who we can push just a little bit harder
because dream directors don&#39;t just come
with answers but with
questions questions that all of you are
capable of asking what really excites
you what change do you want to see in
the world what action do you want to
take by the end of today to make a
better world what skill are you dying to
learn what&#39;s your true purpose in life
we could all step up as dream directors
but we can also hatch a dream tonight of
our own we can define the education
revolution as that revolution that
causes a whole system to make it
possible for every young person to
figure out how to achieve any big
possibility not just in school but for
the rest of their lives and I predict
that will not only lead to an education
revolution that all of us will help to
lead this kind of education revolution
will be led by the young people
themselves that&#39;s the power of it and
all the rest of us will watch as they
awaken to their innate power to change
the world before they even turn 18 and
we will proudly follow those young
people as they lead us toward toward
achieving the collective future of our
dreams thank you
[Applause]
