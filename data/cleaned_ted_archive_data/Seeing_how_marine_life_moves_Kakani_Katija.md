hi everyone how are you all doing so my
name is coo connie chiquita and i&#39;m a
bioengineer i study marine organisms in
their natural environment and what i
want to point out and at least you can
see this in this visualization is that
the ocean environment is a dynamic place
right what you&#39;re seeing are the kinds
of currents of the worlds that are left
behind in the ocean because as ties or
because of winds and imagine a marine
organism is living in this environment
right and they&#39;re trying to undergo
their entire lives while dealing with
currents like these but what I also want
to point out is that small organisms
also create small fluid motions as well
and it&#39;s these fluid motions that I
study and we can think about them like
being footprints so this is my dog
Kieran right she&#39;s really cute I think
so too but let&#39;s ignore the cuteness for
a moment and take a look at her
footprints right footprints provide a
lot of information not only do they tell
us what kind of organism left them might
also tell us something about when that
organism was there but also what kind of
behavior were they running or were they
walking and to terrestrial organisms
like my cute dog Kieran might be leaving
foot runs behind in dirt or in sand but
marine organisms we&#39;ve footprint in the
form of what we call wake structures or
hydrodynamic signatures in fluid now
imagine right it&#39;s really hard to see
these kinds of structures because fluid
is transparent however if we add
something to the fluid we got a
completely different picture and you can
see that these footprints that marine
organisms create our just dynamics
aren&#39;t constantly changing and marine
organisms also have the ability to sense
these signatures they can also inform
decisions like whether or not they want
to continue following a signature like
this to find a mate or to find food or
maybe you avoid these signatures right
to avoid being eaten and so imagine the
ability to be able to not on
see or visualize these kinds of
signatures but to also measure them now
remember I&#39;m a bioengineer and I&#39;m also
this is the engineering side of what I
do and so what I&#39;ve done was I actually
took a laboratory technique and
miniaturized it and basically shrunk it
down into at the use of underwater
housings to make a device that a single
scuba diver can use and so a single
scuba diver can go anywhere from the
surface to 40 meters or 120 feet deep to
measure the hydrodynamic signatures that
organisms create and now I want to
before I begin I want to kind of immerse
you into what these kinds of
measurements require so in order to work
we actually dive at night and this is
because we&#39;re trying to minimize any
interactions between the laser and
sunlight and we&#39;re diving in complete
darkness because we do not want to scare
away the organisms we&#39;re trying to study
and then once we find the organisms we
are interested in we turn on a green
laser and this green laser is actually
illuminating a sheet of fluid and in
that fluid it&#39;s reflecting off of
particles that are found everywhere in
the ocean and so as an animal swims
through this laser sheet you can see
these particles are moving over time and
so a lot of you think okay this lady&#39;s
crazy right well we actually risked our
lives to get this kind of data what
you&#39;re going to see is that on the left
if you do particle images that shows the
displacement of fluid over time and
using that data you can actually extract
what the velocity of that fluid is and
that&#39;s indicated by the vector plots
that you see in the middle and then we
can use that data to answer a variety of
different questions not only to
understand the rotational sense of that
fluid which you see on the right but
also estimate something about energetics
or the kinds of forces that are act on
these organisms or on the fluid and also
evaluate swimming and feeding
performance now we&#39;ve used this
technique on a variety of different
organisms
but remember there&#39;s an issue here we&#39;re
only able to study organisms that a
scuba diver can reach and so before I
finish I can I want to tell you what the
next frontier is in terms of these kinds
of measurements and with collaborators
at monterey bay aquarium research
institute we&#39;re developing
instrumentation to go on remotely
operated vehicles so we can study
organisms anywhere from the surface down
to 4,000 meters or two and a half miles
and so we can answer really interesting
questions about this organism this is a
larvae shin that creates a feeding
current and forces fluid through their
new kissed house and extract nutrients
and then this animal this is a slice
fauna for and they can get to length
about half the size of the football
field and they&#39;re able to swim
vertically in the ocean by just creating
jet propulsion and then finally we can
answer these questions about how
swarming organisms like krill are able
to affect mixing on larger scales and
this is actually one of the most
interesting results so far that we&#39;ve
collected using the scuba diving device
and that organisms especially when
they&#39;re moving in math are able to
generate mixing at levels that are
equivalent to some other physical
processes that are associated with winds
and times but before I finish I kind of
want to leave you all with a question
because I think it&#39;s important to keep
in mind that the technologies today that
we take it for granted started somewhere
right it was inspired from something so
imagine right scientists and engineers
were inspired by birds to create
airplanes and something we take for
granted flying from let&#39;s say San
Francisco to New York is it something
that was inspired by an organism and as
we&#39;re developing these new technologies
right to understand marine organisms
what we want to do is answer this
question how will new marine organisms
inspire us will they allow us to develop
new underwater technologies like
underwater vehicles that look like a
jellyfish
and with is I think as a really exciting
time in ocean exploration because now we
have the tools available to answer this
kind of question and with the help of
you guys at some point you can apply
these tools to answer this kind of
question and also develop technologies
of the future thank you
