good afternoon everyone I want to talk
to you a little bit about the
environment and ecosystems have you ever
thought about how you could impact the
environment that you live in and
furthermore this big ecosystem that that
we&#39;re all involved with well as you know
Detroit gets a lot of news coverage
there are a lot of stories that are on
the news that talk about the negative
things of Detroit so they can&#39;t land
dilapidated properties buildings that
have been pretty much abandoned or
vacant since of 67 riots but that&#39;s all
true that exists but Detroit is a gem in
fact there are so many different
precious resources they&#39;re gifted and
talented people and there&#39;s a lot of
positive things that are going on in
that city and we wanted to create a
movement in Detroit wanted to create a
composting company because leased out
that there are so many resources and
there are a lot of corporations in the
city who are pushing zero waste landfill
free and when the urban farming movement
kicked off they thought you know what
can we do with this vacant land what can
we do with some of these buildings we
tear them down do we rebuild what can we
do and we we wanted to be a part of the
recovery process of that so I approached
the Detroit Zoological Society General
Motors Ford Blue Cross Blue Shield and
many more corporations and I asked them
would they be willing to give me their
food waste and of course they wanted to
know why and the Detroit Zoological
Society wanted to know how they could
fit into that equation and I said it&#39;s
simple the urban farming movement is a
way for us to help recover and we want
to be an engine for that movement but
it&#39;s not just about the food but it&#39;s
also about the soil contamination
and the issues that we&#39;re dealing with
and we want to we want to start
developing soil variations we want to
you know create these green pathways to
get the attention of the community but
we want to create a closed-loop system
that could be replicated anywhere so
when the Detroit Zoological Society
decided that they would allow us to have
their herbivore manure which is of
course the animals to eat green organic
plant matter they came on board and then
some of the corporations decided they
wanted to see where I was going so they
participated as well and so within this
closed loop system we wanted to create
the system so it would become socially
economically and environmentally
impactful I wanted to help corporations
save money I wanted to make sure the zoo
knew that I was going to take this
precious resource and do something with
it so we take food waste herbivore
manure we process it and we make soil
from those materials now I&#39;ll give you
an example General Motors has a huge
headquarters is about five million
square feet so we took those rooftops on
that headquarters building and we put
some compost there and we started
creating gardens and vacant parking lot
rooftops so we created the system that
goes full circle so we&#39;re taking the
waste from the cafeterias local
restaurants breweries coffee shops you
name it all of those are resources that
can become the decomposition of those
resources actually turn into soil so
with that being said we have probably 80
to 100 different examples of this going
on through the city where our focus is
waste reduction diverting waste from the
landfill now I of course am very excited
about this movement for the simple fact
that the youth young people such as
yours
are the leaders you are the future and
so I thought composting with these are
baby steps to heading in a direction of
waste to energy conversion we of course
want to take that waste and also use it
because it&#39;s an energy source we can
capture methane from it we can heat
green houses we can heat buildings with
this so you guys are the future you live
in this ecosystem we&#39;re all connected to
the soil but we all need to figure out
what role we want to play and all of you
can play a significant part in this the
ecosystem is precious and we need to
think about how we&#39;re going to be
involved because we&#39;re all connected
everything that we do within this
ecosystem is going to affect the future
I wanted to create a model that would
give people a sense of pride that they
could be and be involved in a closed
loop system that can help feed third
world countries that can help clean up
your own environment that you live in
you name it if you decide to step up and
get involved in helping the ecosystem
we&#39;re going to have a brighter future
and you represent that future so I want
you to think about that from here on out
every day think about how you can take
something as simple as food waste
minimize waste don&#39;t be wasteful think
about that we&#39;re doing things as simple
as feeding the homeless and as well as
creating compost you&#39;re the future thank
you
[Applause]
