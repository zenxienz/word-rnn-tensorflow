in 1972 my mother sent me a postcard
from New York and she wrote messy one
day you should see this life in this
city when I finally moved to New York in
1984 or what I have with me was two
pieces of luggages and this postcard so
what are you put in these two bags when
you&#39;re living all your life behind I had
a book by Pablo Neruda where they was a
poem that every time I read it she
dispersed the clouds so beautifully that
I felt that I was under almost touching
it he had to come then obviously some
clothes paints and brushes and of course
the postcard of my mother that was all
but I had a dream I wanted the life of
an artist like in the movies I have seen
back home about Hemingway and the Lost
Generation were they wanted to leave the
bohemian life they were young and they
have a lot of passions of their own but
it was totally unreasonable I was a
psychology major missing only three
months from getting my degree but I had
a revelation that I was not going to be
a good psychologist so I stand up I
remember very clear and I woke up sighs
look up the sky and saw these beautiful
clouds and decided that he was over it
was so sullen I lived to New York in
like less than a week you can imagine
how my parents felt very hurt and it is
me because of my impulsiveness but I
wanted to leave this romantic life as an
artist so once I was in New York I
didn&#39;t want to go to college to study
art I wanted to study art organically so
I went to the Art Students
League and to the mess and I study
composition in the log intellectual
knowledge from bootlegs keep you know
pick up on every day on my way so I have
managed to New York physically but I
have this really burning desire but I
wanted to share my work with as an
artist with other people so I decided
that I had to do something that it was
very close to my heart and to my culture
for sample the floating islands in David
Akaka these floating islands are located
in the southeast in Peru they were rows
are praying at people that live in these
islands for over 3,000 years
using these giant plans named dr. arrays
to use everything which they build
houses they build boats and watch towers
they&#39;re worth knows very well that if
they don&#39;t maintain these islands they
will get rotten they will sink and they
will cease to exist this experience of
observing and being with the earth made
me realize as life very ephemeral and I
was thinking would it be wonderful if we
all of us at some point of our life have
the opportunity to make the changes and
let go of things
this is empty it was a good delay this
is worth house this is the first piece I
did in the other series I have just
arrived from Betty takaka and I had the
opportunity to collaborate with the
Armory Show and Time Square Alliance
oopsy
sorry something happy with it it&#39;s nice
to go to little stock would try it again
okay there we go this is over the house
I wanted to make a point to make it the
shape very organic so these will stay
and stand in contrast with all the
vertical buildings that they were all
around also I wanted to make sure that I
was bringing my own interpretation of
the oral health that I saw in Letty
takaka all the way in the center of
Times Square it was a dream that I had
since I just arrived in the 90-84 let me
share with you some other pieces and
they were serious and other
collaborations
[Music]
lynnie let me share with you now how the
word developed from the oral serials to
the one Chekhov series one charcoal is
negated in a small fishing village in
the northern part of the rule very far
away from the apt caca
when charcoal is a small fishing village
like I have mentioned before and when I
arrived I had the opportunity to see
again this total rates but this time
they were much much taller and what he
called my attention was how they were
really swinging on the wall it was
really a very experience that I really
got to stay with me so I thought Bremen
ISA
wouldn&#39;t be amazing if you take the
imprint that you see on top of the
silkscreen on the bubbles all the way
3-dimensional so this way they will be
parallel to the swinging of these
tutorials on the air
as you see light is very important for
my work a couple of years ago I to Anna
forgettable trip to Iceland what I have
the opportunity to see Anna rubber Alice
offer a lot of you known as the Northern
Lights these experience led me
fascinated and I said would it be great
if I could take the magic and the
mystery that I create to for the first
time make this in Mersin experience that
I was looking I wanted the piece the
person and the space to truly be one and
talking about space it brings me to for
me each one is like a little living
organism the really mundane and it takes
one they want me to do on them and each
the night in sequence has to be made
actually on the present moment after I
finish installing the piece because the
bubbles and the lines of LEDs become
like my instrument to me when I&#39;m doing
the sequence is like I&#39;m conducting and
composing music I truly want to make the
viewer all be in the same space and
under a lot of different layers let me
talk about Fortuna Fortuna was a
collaboration that I did with a Minister
of Culture in Spain Fortuna was the
first time that I use a long tunnel and
it was I treated Fortuna as this pumping
heart and I wanted to bring the viewer
all the way from one end to the other to
create a sense of continuity let me show
you how
[Music]
thank you so we will talk about how I
truly make an effort to connect with my
viewer so we live in these daily life of
us using the smartphones we always are
tweeting or posting images in our
Instagram whenever Facebook
so for tune up with these in mind I
wanted to create truly a connection with
my viewer with people so when you go to
see my installations there&#39;s going to be
something for everybody it&#39;s going to be
either you&#39;re going to be interesting in
this space in the form in the shade in
the materials that are going to be used
for some of they might be the electrical
hardware or the sounds of those
beautiful power supplies so I wanted to
create from beginning to end this in
massing like large living organism with
you and the piece becomes actually one
in my most latest work breathless
Medellin I have the opportunity to do
this work in downtown Manhattan in the
windy streets of the financial district
in New York with breathless maintain I
wanted as his famous sounds I wanted the
light to explode and to burst into the
streets and I wanted to grab my passerby
because I wanted them to make that turn
look and make them think let me share
with you this breathless Medellin
our input DNC condition
and for my latest work I it takes me all
the way back to Lake Titicaca in Peru
where I have the opportunity to see how
they were building a watchtower and that
brought to me surveillance surveillance
the with the mirror we live in these
cities that we are as we other speakers
have share we are being always bad but a
lot a lot of cameras so with the mirror
of domes you&#39;re going to see yourself
you&#39;re going to be watching and they&#39;re
going to be watching you as well and
this is your Ganesha tea of life it all
grows according to our on experiences
thank you for letting me share with you
my journey of being truthful to myself I
started 13 years ago when I left Peru
thank you
[Applause]
