every one of a certain age has felt
washed up your old tricks are old tricks
whether in your business or personal
life whether you&#39;re talking about a
country the environment the world
economic system there comes a time when
what you want most of all is a big
dramatic comeback not too long ago I
found myself without a job job that gave
me a lot of meaning la job where I
worked alongside people I loved I was
unsure what to do next
uncertain some days that I had much to
offer anyone well it turns out that
there&#39;s plenty of advice that people
give for comebacks and a very small
amount of it seems to be based on
empirical evidence and as I took
responsibility for my own comeback I
found the conventional models
unsatisfactory I needed something more
sustainable and what I needed I realized
was Tina Turner now you might think that
the woman who wrote Nutbush City Limits
the woman who double-timed proud marry
into the top five the woman who taunted
Mel Gibson in the Thunderdome might not
be a good model for business people well
I you know I studied a lot of comebacks
while I was sweating out my own and I
realized that she has messages that are
good for anyone in any business any
anything that they could take and here
are the four lessons first come back to
take a long time when Tina hit with her
first version with her version of let&#39;s
stay together it was the first time
she&#39;d made it onto the Billboard charts
in nine years that&#39;s the that&#39;s three
lifetimes in in pop music during that
decade she did everything she could to
keep going she did Vegas she did
Hollywood Squares
but even when she did had to do
corporate events to pay the rent she was
doing her job she kept going second of
all comebacks don&#39;t happen all at once
private dancer her comeback album was
the fifth solo record she made after she
left Ike she&#39;s tried different
approaches until a new generation of
British
just caught up with her she experimented
and refined experimented and refined
until she got it right three private
dancer she was surrounded by top
collaborators why because she had
garnered so much goodwill from her work
beforehand
people who need comebacks had something
good going before they needed to come
back the people who will accompany you
on your comeback chances are they know
about you already
and then finally be yourself but be
current
private dancer worked because it sounded
like the voice of tina was this voice
that you loved but the music was
something totally different everything
you loved about her was still there but
it wasn&#39;t nostalgia it was up-to-date
show your strengths show them off even
but emphasize what&#39;s new be modern do it
in a modern context now I&#39;m not Tina
Turner and no matter how well your legs
have held up you weren&#39;t either but the
way that she didn&#39;t merely come back but
she surpassed herself the first time
around those are steps that any person
any business can can follow it&#39;s worth
pointing out that it wasn&#39;t until her
comeback that she had her first
number-one record and after you have
your successful comeback maybe you can
get away with looking like this thank
you very much
[Applause]
