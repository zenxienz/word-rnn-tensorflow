I&#39;ve got a vision for you in the future
every story you tell can have an impact
every idea you share can influence
people every vision you spread can move
your audience to take action you guys
believe me
probably not but let me explain I&#39;m a
data scientist I use software and data
to analyze communications to help people
connect with their audiences I&#39;ve been
doing this for years but it&#39;s actually
not how my career started I began my
career by running quantitative analysis
on Wall Street we had piles of data and
my job was to sift through every number
I could get my hands on so we can make
billion dollar deals work over time I
started to notice that there was a
missing factor from our model the
concept actually seemed pretty simple if
the leaders of these companies were able
to effectively communicate their vision
the deals got done but for that how
leaders communicate vision we didn&#39;t
have any data I&#39;m a numbers guy so I
didn&#39;t understand why so I started
working on a way to analyze it spent the
first two years building a massive
database of people&#39;s communications
millions of pieces of text audio and
video everything we could scrape
together and then we went out and we
asked thousands of audiences why they
liked trust engage with and believe in
certain types of people leaders and
messages what we know is that so much of
what we communicate is delivered and
received unconsciously I&#39;m talking about
our body language our vocal patterns our
pronouns we aren&#39;t conscious of this
stuff but it has a huge influence on how
we impact an audience what&#39;s exciting
and new here is we can use technology
like natural language processing
phonetic analysis and facial and gesture
recognition to make sense of these
unconscious signals and give people
conscious knowledge of them and with
that you can make them much more
effective communicators we can also
identify groups of impressive
communicators the best CEOs the most
trustworthy politicians if such a thing
exists so we ran our analysis on the
world&#39;s top visionaries we built a data
set we started with everybody from FDR
to MLK the Wright brothers Amelia
Earhart TED Talks on innovation global
thought leaders inventors and dreamers
and then we ran this analysis scale
comparing hundreds of their transcripts
all the language that the topics the
phrases and even the specific words
against a benchmark of everyday
communicators what we were trying to do
is discover what these people do
differently and what we found is that
the world&#39;s top visionaries communicate
three things in common but it wasn&#39;t
what we expected
I obviously expected the top visionaries
would talk about the future they would
create this vivid picture of a future
world with all these amazing new
benefits but in reality they talk about
the present the most distinguishing
factor by almost 2x is how much they use
the present tense 15% more they
communicate 15% more about today and 14%
less about tomorrow versus the average
communicator so here how someone would
say it we will achieve these results
versus we plan to achieve these results
and when you say it the second way it&#39;s
an its implied that you&#39;re going to
follow that with how our data shows that
it&#39;s this nuance that makes all the
difference for your audience it makes
the vision credible believable and
actionable so let&#39;s look at how
well-known visionary does this let&#39;s
take a look at Elon Musk his visions are
startling hyper looping from LA to San
Francisco in 30 minutes the guy wants to
die on Mars but not on impact but the
way he taught but the way he talks about
this stuff read this quote the question
is how do you accelerate the advent of
electric transport in order to do that
for cars you have to come up with a
really energy efficient car so that
means making it incredibly light he&#39;s
not out there talking about some George
Jetson hovercraft
he&#39;s bringing his vision to now and we
believe him as a visionary because his
ideas can be implemented now so let&#39;s
look at the linguistic data on Elon
here&#39;s a transcript where I&#39;ve faded out
it&#39;s called the future of energy and
transport what I&#39;ve done here has
highlighted his present tense in yellow
and his future tense in green when Elon
Musk communicates and we&#39;ve looked at
him over 40 times over the last five
years he uses four times as much present
tense versus future tense as compared to
the average communicator
he&#39;s always talking about now the second
distinguishing factor we found about how
visionaries talk is that they&#39;re not
highly complex or theoretical in fact
the world&#39;s top visionaries communicate
20% more clearly than the average
communicator how do you measure clarity
it&#39;s fewer syllables per word it&#39;s fewer
words per sentence it&#39;s a really clear
topical cause and effect so imagine a
CEO says something like over the next
three quarters through cost-cutting
efficiencies and improve synergies we
will improve our results by
approximately 10 to 15% or over the next
three quarters through three methods we
will improve our results by twelve and a
half percent there&#39;s a drastic
difference so let&#39;s look at how well
went on visionary does this take Sheryl
Sandberg at a recent commencement
address she said believing in yourself
was part of what got you to this special
day continue to believe in yourselves
don&#39;t let anyone put limits on you don&#39;t
put limits on yourself Sheryl Sandberg
communicates 85% more clearly than the
average CEO people connect with her they
believed with her because her because of
the way that she communicates she&#39;s
actually one of the clearest
communicators we&#39;ve ever measured the
third distinguishing factor we found
about visionaries is we thought they
would be power driven and hypothetical
but in fact when visionaries talk they
use sixty percent more second person
pronouns like you and your and there&#39;s
something else they use 38% more
perceptor e-language how things sense
touch and feel so a CEO could say
something like in the future connected
home will have great benefits but a
visionary leader would say connected
homes will have benefits for you but
make your bed warm when you crawl into
it at night there&#39;ll be a warm cup of
coffee that you&#39;re excited to drink when
you wake up feeling fresh in the morning
it&#39;s a drastic difference they bring you
into the experience a good example here
is Richard Brandt
it Richard Branson when talking about
space will say things like when the
rocket stops you will be in space there
will be complete silence
you will unbuckle and you will float
around as you gently lift up and hit the
roof he brings you into the spacecraft
with him and that&#39;s why you can
experience it and that&#39;s why you believe
his vision so what do we learn from all
this well our data shows that once you
have a clear vision the hard work has
really just started you&#39;ve got to
communicate it in a way that focuses it
on the present uses clear and simple
language and let and brings your
audience into that vision and if you do
that you can inspire anyone because we
all want to hear vision and we all want
our visions to be heard what&#39;s exciting
is with data we now know how thank you
