there Arsenal this session is about
connecting the continent and the
speakers before me have done a very good
job of trying to explain what this means
what it will take how easy or how
difficult it can be I personally don&#39;t
think that I&#39;m the most competent person
to be talking about this but I&#39;ll give
it my best shot we&#39;ve heard from experts
over the past two days the huge strides
that Africa has made in these efforts to
connect to the rest of the world despite
its dismal performance in comparison to
say Asia or South America Africa has
experienced foreign phenomenal growth in
the area of ICT in the last decade as a
matter of fact Africa became the first
continent in the 21st century to go
completely wireless when the number with
mobile phone lines overtook fixed lines
around the turn of the century we have
also heard that what what that Africa&#39;s
wireless sector is the fastest growing
in the whole world more fiber optic
cables are being planned to connect
Africa with the world at higher speeds
and lower cost computer prices are
coming down thanks to the initiatives of
the likes of A&amp;E and others making them
affordable to more people it&#39;s true
the internet access remains patchy and
expensive in most parts of Africa it&#39;s
also true that IT literacy rates still
lag behind the rest of the world by a
significant margin but the above
notwithstanding Africa&#39;s made great
progress yesterday you had Ted Kidani
tell us that we have software labs on
the continent that can produce
world-class computer code Florence Ariki
of Nigeria showed us not only hunter
anuria drive but also made a promise
to start manufacturing computer
motherboards in Africa which in itself
would be a revolution no as a matter of
Ethiopia pioneered the satellite radio
innovation and Kwabena by hand he&#39;s on
his way to creating a computer that can
think and feel like a human being
Elena Cabramatta Dean of a co P again
showed us a model of a commodity
commodities exchange that she&#39;s building
for her night of country Ethiopia and in
it we could see the critical role that
IT will play in delivering information
to all market stakeholders and Newton
adraka is using technology to make
powerful trailblazing films about
African issues and alicante connected
water on Congo with GSM while making a
bag full of money along the way all
these and more are African pioneers real
people with big ideas and the
determination is so strong you would not
dare stand in their way they give me
hope that despite all our shortcomings
poverty and all the negative things that
are always associated with a continent
something great is a food in Africa
thanks to the industriousness of its
people and thanks to information
technology so the quanta the question is
the continent connected I think the
answer is yes is it connected enough
definitely not what we are going to do
about it I&#39;m going to try and see or
explain to you what I think we can do I
think we need to do more when it works
water when it but more importantly we
need to fundamentally change the
development strategies of our countries
or the continents if the connection we
have made with the world is not to be
lost in the not-so-distant future
it is important to understand like great
as it is what we have achieved so far is
the easy part the continent remains very
vulnerable and unconnected both within
as you have had and without while it
costs as little as $200 to create the
network resource that connects one
person two adjacent network and at the
same time creates value of five hundred
dollars to the investor almost instantly
it costs more than three hundred
thousand dollars in many African
countries to build one kilometre of
thermic Road and pay back in road
investments is believed to take no less
than 40 years if at all what I mean to
say that there is a connection that the
continent has not make made and this
connection is important in more ways
than one when I listen to two speakers
talk about the Cape Town to Cairo
adventure through the two days ago
I wondered what what exactly they drove
on because what we have in Africa
between Cairo and Cape Town is probably
what you saw in the map that was
presented by the gentleman from Congo
most of the time you have open desert
you have food paths of varying degrees
of poor quality that&#39;s what we call
roads we&#39;ve heard that Africa has got
the most underdeveloped infrastructure
in the whole world
and we also know that roads bad roads
dilapidated railways congested
inefficient ports dangerous airports
don&#39;t make for great connections or
functioning economies Africa has an
energy deficit we heard from mr. Idris
yesterday of 17 megawatts power and no
clean running water for most of its
people so Africa&#39;s connection and indeed
any connection in this context I think
goes beyond the telephone and the
internet for Africa to be connected to
the world it needs to grow its economies
but before we can succeed in growing our
economies we must build efficient
infrastructures namely good roads that
and all whether strong railroads energy
plants that meat consumption and growth
demands more than sea and England Post
and clean water for all our people in
addition to the many kilometers of fiber
optics that we are building even as I
speak more importantly we must be
connected to each other within our
individual countries and then connect
African countries with modern
infrastructure so that into Africa trade
can flourish there is a lot of difficult
work ahead there is however one problem
building infrastructure is very
expensive and until now we have not
developed plans for funding big
infrastructure projects in Africa and if
recent trends are to be believed
Africa&#39;s development partners have
little appetite if any for funding
infrastructure projects on a large scale
insisting that these investments must be
done by the private sector although
there is no evidence that the private
sector apart from mobile telephony and
some ICT infrastructure can actually
build sustainable infrastructure
investments that are payback and that
justify shareholder expectations of such
investments so the biggest constraint
seems to be money and this money I want
to talk about Africa must build its
infrastructure because there is no other
way of staying connected to the rest of
the world if we do not what is
interesting and hopeful for me is that
actually money isn&#39;t a problem we have
more money in Africa than we need to
build all the roads and all the ports
and all the power plants that we need
for our development I&#39;ll try to show you
how but before I do that I need to say
that we need to reposition Africa in the
global economy
miss Ghazi okonjo-iweala who spoke at
the Ted in Monterrey a few months ago
said that if you want to help Africa
then do business in Africa
and do so not as charity but to make
money for your shareholders in the
process create opportunities and jobs
for Africans you&#39;ve been either spoke on
Monday and showed us a picture of a dark
continent that&#39;s waiting to build it and
explain how billions of dollars and if
it is triggered are to be believed 70
billion dollars to build the network the
power infrastructure in Africa
that&#39;s the deficit that needs to be
overcome it&#39;s an investment opportunity
so Africa is at a tipping point Africa
is facing a moment of historic
opportunity and the opportunity
underpinned by a vibrant resource sector
I know that&#39;s making some people
uncomfortable we have growing consumer
demand that goes beyond what we are seen
in the telephone sector we have the
rising prominence of the private sector
we are developing our capital markets
include including commodities exchange
we are restructuring our markets as well
and improving political governance
notwithstanding what has been said about
African Governance a Chinese friend of
mine told me that according to Chinese
wisdom the first generation of emerging
or people in emerging economies normally
makes his money if they are smart from
the soil because this is not a source of
money and then they use their wealth to
probably build an educated second
generation and that educated second the
drain generation goes on to build
industries and then you have situations
unfolding that we have seen in the
developer in the developed world and I
think this philosophy or wisdom is not
true only for China but also in the
United States if you recall at the turn
of the 19th century more than 75 percent
of the u.s. GDP was attributable to
cotton production in the south and
associated industries and
colonial empires such as Great Britain
Spain Belgium and Portugal all of these
build the economies and minerals and
agricultural produce that they extracted
from the soils of the countries they
ruled at the time this phase of growth
was followed by a natural revolution or
explosion and the rest is history as the
saying goes Africa - we want to walk
down this world Road and Taff - his
economic success I think
you have never seen a continent as rich
as Africa and as poor at the same time
as Africa then there is this whole issue
of a mineral curse and to ask you
whether it&#39;s a myth or reality of or
maybe share my two cents I think that
it&#39;s a myth because different African
countries with mineral wealth have
behaved differently depending on the
kind of leadership that you had at the
time for example while the discovery of
diamonds led to a brutal civil war in
Sierra Leone in Liberia but so Ana has
been peacefully mining diamonds for more
than forty years and having the process
build a rich economy that compares to
some countries in the European Union the
same applies to countries like Namibia
South Africa South Africa Tanzania
Zambia and many others although they
don&#39;t compared Botswana in terms of
wealth and this is the nature of the
challenge that we face I think is
therefore leadership failure and not a
curse that causes conflicts over
minerals and other forms of wealth in
Africa and if you don&#39;t believe me then
you have to tell me why the mineral cars
did not harm King Leopold of Belgium or
Sofia Rhodes who became incredibly
wealthy on these minerals and made their
countries also very wealthy I would like
to know at what point in our history
this became a curse but there is more to
Africa as wealth I don&#39;t know if you can
see those figures some of you who know
what this valve these minerals costs
today in the market can probably work
out quickly the amount of well fact lies
and the African soils is mind-boggling
I&#39;m not going to try and work it out for
you but it seems to me that there is no
single place on this planet that&#39;s
richer than
Africa in terms of minerals that the
world needs for development not just for
luxury for development these minerals as
we speak are being mined whether we like
it or not they are being mined whether
they are destroying or threatening the
environment or not in developing
countries and in developed countries
Africa hosts nine point four percent of
the world&#39;s proven oil and gas deposits
and the u.s. by far the world&#39;s biggest
economy has declared African oil its
strategic target in aims to draw 25
percent of all these imports from Africa
by the year 22 2015 this is an
unprecedented opportunity for African
oil producers China and other economic
giant has recently taken a keen interest
in Africa also driven by Tonga for
African commodities India in China as
you know are said to become if they not
they are not already the biggest
subcontractors of Western Japanese
multinational and japanese
multinationals meaning that Africa has
incredible opportunities right now to do
business and you don&#39;t want you don&#39;t
have to wait for the WTO trade deal to
be concluded to do this kind of business
in Africa has a huge internal market
that will grow to more than a billion
people over the next decade an increase
in traffic on trade made possible by
modern infrastructure and deep economic
integration is a huge opportunity for
the continent
I&#39;d like to show you how fast exports
from Africa to to China are growing and
also how fast imports from our from
China to Africa are growing I think this
graph speaks for itself we are talking
about forty four percent per annum in
terms of exports going from Africa to
China and for the first time Africa has
a trade surplus with a trade partner
Africa is indeed open for business
but this time round the Africa you will
see is the place where smart people like
those you have met here at Ted live and
work I have confidence in these Africans
these people know what to do about the
threat to the environment that
caught by both climate change and
industrial activity they know how to
manage and invest the wealth that will
come from entrepreneurial activity on
the continent they have the capacity to
create policies that encourage
investment in Africa&#39;s resources sector
and indeed in all sectors of the economy
for the benefit of their people they
will ensure a healthy return on the
foreign investment that they seek to
attract Africa by ensuring that the
double strategies of corruption and
inefficiency are defeated once and for
all
more importantly they will build modern
infrastructure to revolutionize the
continent economies and create a better
future for African children and in the
process connect the continent forever to
the rest of the world let me conclude by
saying how blessed I feel to be here Ted
this week both other Tanzanian and as an
African not in my wildest dreams did I
believe I could share space with such
incredible people that you all have it
has been inspiring to listen to Africans
of extraordinary intelligence love and
commitment to the progress of their
continent to hear them talk about the
African realities and about the African
dreams with such passion and grace I did
not know what to expect from Ted I will
leave here with hope that the
possibilities I&#39;ve always dreamt about
will become reality
thanks to all of you
[Applause]
