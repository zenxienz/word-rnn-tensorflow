our versus brand adverse is advertising
for those who have followed my work over
the last 10 years but you may not know
is that we finance all of the projects
through the cells of my artworks there
have never been a brand and NGO or
sponsor behind it three years ago when I
want to Ted price my wish or perhaps my
question was can I change the world well
so I launched the insider project a
global participative art project
allowing everyone to express themselves
through their images however the deeper
question was how to keep myself and
maintain my integrity in the eyes of the
storm I didn&#39;t know what was going to
happen you know it was a big risk for me
but inside I began to go around the
world to all kind of people all kind of
purposes and it was always for free but
when I&#39;m the most proud of is that we
always did it without being sponsored Oh
having a brand or having to say you know
you shouldn&#39;t think like this or breathe
like that or wear those hats and glasses
we all know that many artists have
always collaborated with brand nothing
new there it&#39;s actually a French dude
who who started it you know at a time
where Vancouver was still a city of less
than 10,000 Abbot ins
his name was Toulouse Lautrec and then
many other great artists did it Cindy
Sherman for Mac and he Lebovitz here for
Vito Helmut Newton for Lavazza on the
world for Apple I think and he did
pretty good after that but I know what
you&#39;re gonna say what&#39;s wrong I mean dad
is that the artists doesn&#39;t get hurt and
he make tons of cash right but if you
follow my work it&#39;s probably because you
like the way I see life and society so
if I take advantage of your support to
team up with a company that had complete
different goals to sell you sneakers
perfume or underwear you
be fair that is called delusion and I
don&#39;t want to do that
however sometime when I&#39;ll go against
advertising you can do great thing this
is another campaign of Lavazza by David
LaChapelle it&#39;s not really the work of
David LaChapelle that trills me here but
what came out of it I don&#39;t know if
you&#39;re familiar with the work of a
French artist named just a bit crazy I
agree when he saw this campaign on
Alexanderplatz in Berlin he decided to
cut out and kidnap the girl and wrote a
 visual kidnap in pain now
then he cut the girl take her send it
back to Nevada and say if she don&#39;t pay
now I&#39;m gonna kill her like what man you
know this abyss intense I agree but I
taught him chill down this is just a
piece of violence give it back and he
keep travelling with her in different
countries and then say oh I&#39;m gonna kill
her if they don&#39;t pay I think they pay
at the end but you know through a museum
VIN that boy also did a funny thing he
found a way to you know put rivet on a
pig he tattooed it no an animal with an
arm in the process of this artwork
actually he was begging for it and you
know that was get chicks
this image of Richard Prince make me
laugh also cause a photograph actor he
got a few thousand bucks to photograph
this campaign for marburo and can reach
a prince we photographed it and sold it
for million but I guess that&#39;s the power
of art you know the value of an image
would always worse more in the art world
than in the ad world many time I got
asked by brands you know if to use my
work and this isn&#39;t you know this is an
image of I pasted in Los Angeles and
Volkswagen actually call me and say can
we put a new bid or right in front of
your pasting Wow you think hmm
no then one will sit up front of my
company and say hey man you that new bid
on advertising I was like what
let me check I go online I say whoa
sounds weird let me see closer and then
actually they replaced the image on the
very same mold where I did the pasting
by a fake girl that&#39;s not on get image
that&#39;s getting too far for me but it
triggers a question one day a luxury
brand calls me and they wanted to put
one of my pics in in one of their
commercial and as I refused the guy told
me
how come you put something illegally in
the street and then you tell me I don&#39;t
have the right to film it what&#39;s wrong
with you man he was right I felt
conflicted about it I cannot lie some of
my projects are becoming a bit expensive
too to make you know so why wouldn&#39;t I
get the money from a brand we both use
the street we boys choose images and we
both have the same target so why don&#39;t
we work together well let me explain you
why choose not to when I do my work I
have freedom you know my only limit is
my responsibility Bren have constraint
Bren have to test their message before
it goes out there on the street because
Bren cannot fail art can add can only
fail or surprise but when I&#39;m surprised
it&#39;s real surprise even the real
surprise can be really good or really
bad I do fail sometime I do fail because
I have the duty to fail if I don&#39;t risk
enough I wouldn&#39;t be a real artist you
know I wouldn&#39;t be always searching for
limits take risk
after all these don&#39;t tell me that I&#39;ve
become a brand because brand is about
intellectual property copyright and
brand identity these are things they
hold onto at all costs to give them away
is suicide after starting my Ted you
know project three years ago we went
against every marketing rule in the book
I gave over my process and give the tool
to copy my work I load everyone to share
a message the project became available
to all and they were able to do more in
three years that I could have done in a
lifetime the impact of the action of the
action was amazing because it was done
you know by locals without me I couldn&#39;t
have gone to Afghanistan Ukraine Malawi
Colombia you know even no sport and do
what they did and why would I so know an
artist is not a brand a brand role is to
be consistent and predictable the artist
is trying to transform his time instead
of reflecting it so his role is to be
ever-changing evolving and to challenge
the status quo thank you
okay
I just want to keep you from one moment
I am I really understand that the the
right and the necessity to fail I mean I
think that that you have to protect that
at all costs but I&#39;m curious are there
ways for brands companies to actually to
work with artists and that in that can&#39;t
they both kind of yeah succeed with each
other yes I think actually they come
many great out is did it and that was
just a couple of example I just think
they have to to think of the way they do
it instead of sponsoring it they have to
Commission it because what&#39;s important
in the artist is his integrity so they
have to think like a scientist or like a
journalist where you can&#39;t actually get
over his integrity you have to you know
correct like like Commission the world
but let the artist you know created you
can&#39;t get in that but that&#39;s the only
part if you take it you basically you
know took of the most important soul of
the others and that&#39;s why you know a lot
of artists feel they&#39;re selling their
soul when they do jr. thank you keep it
up thank you we will follow you wherever
you go thank you
[Applause]
