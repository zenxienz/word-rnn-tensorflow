so make it quick okay my name is how
much in rehearsais I&#39;m the chairman of
the soft tribe subscribe is a software
company based out of Accra Ghana let me
give you a bit of about what I&#39;ve been
doing over the last 10 to 15 years what
my vision is for Africa using technology
good now went to school a university in
America left three weeks after I
graduated totally convinced that given
the anti development in Africa there was
no no no place in the world with more
opportunities because every feature of
and the development represented a
business opportunity this is kind of
stole my philosophy relent a bit since
then I still believe that
now of course leaving University with no
money not even credit cards I went back
home and I studied Manufacturing
realized that a heck I don&#39;t have any
money to set up industry and I want to
work for myself I realized I had a PC
and the PC in the certain sense was a
faction it could make software so
started developing software sitting on
my bed my bedroom my parents house and
parents were out of the country so I had
you know fearing for a couple of years
now
we showed software got a couple of
partners we sold software both more
computers it&#39;s all software what more
computers like heck this thing is going
really well we did this for ten years
wound up with the company knows
basically the leading software operation
in West Africa and my partner&#39;s were
very happy was sitting in Ghana and
suddenly we&#39;ve got this thing working
with ten doubling our turnover every
year and it was wonderful
now as a matter of policy we avoided
given what everybody has said we avoided
any government involvement no government
contracts we don&#39;t want them that was
our attitude until 10 years passed the
company was so big we don&#39;t employ 70
people and realize that to sustain what
we were doing the private sector in
Ghana was too small
so we did two things we started
exporting into Nigeria into Togo to
neighboring countries and we started
saying well maybe we have to go and face
this government by the bullet and save
the government sector and that was the
beginning now firstly we hit we started
we couldn&#39;t understand what was
happening we had the example a payroll
system or the national standard
everybody in Ghana used our payroll
system but Ghana government they had the
biggest payroll problem people people
were paying us anything from $5,000 to
maybe a hundred thousand dollars for our
solution and the government had paid
eight million pounds these eight million
pounds were given to our government by
the British government to facilitate
this payroll system that wasn&#39;t working
and workers on the streets etc etc and
we had the solution and we were offering
it for free because it is good for our
reputation so I&#39;ve done the national
payroll because then we could hit hit
other countries and they weren&#39;t taking
it and what was most interesting was the
British who had funded this project for
eight million pounds used our payroll
system for the High Commission so
yeah so we we&#39;re very confused we had we
thought we&#39;re market leaders we&#39;re
innovators we&#39;re gonna an got this
tropical tolerance thing going we&#39;re
building software that can survive in
the price is good and communication
breakdowns it can handle past failures
will come back on as soon as the power
comes quickly in between the generator
and the UPS and the PC were experts at
this stuff so we were very very
disappointed for a couple of years we
actually couldn&#39;t believe what was
happening but it wasn&#39;t about the
software it was about something else now
for that reason we had we had to take it
upon ourselves in an arrogant way
because we think we know everything and
research as to why a company couldn&#39;t
grow and become like Microsoft what we
found out was mind-boggling and what
I&#39;ll just use all the conclusions of
what the mindset is for us now in terms
of moving our business forward we
realize that we still had a colonial
economy there are two kinds of countries
the hunter countries that go out and
hunt for business in other countries and
there&#39;s a hundred countries and they I
just pray and we realized that we were
in a hunted country sunset countries
don&#39;t have technology companies that are
exporting they have no facilities for
managing such a situation there&#39;s no
advert on CNN by our government saying
by Ghana by Kenyan software it wasn&#39;t
designed for that so it&#39;s going to dig
go down to the ground not they
themselves have an American company dig
gold out of the ground and then
everybody takes their percentage that
was that&#39;s what it was designed for and
we realized that were now we also
realized that to a certain extent we
always thought we therefore thought
these people evil people all these
government official tax they&#39;re really
evil but lately we&#39;ve come to realize
that it&#39;s real if they weren&#39;t doing
that what other opportunity exists what
are they going to do you go to
university you become some civil servant
well if your lot in life to survive on
$300 a month for 40 years and die poor
that&#39;s not why you went to school and
I&#39;ve come we come to the realization
that it&#39;s unreasonable to expect
they will sit there and have these
monies passing in front of them and they
won&#39;t take it it is a totally
unreasonable expectation right so we
have to be very practical about it what
we need to do to solve the problems
firstly is that you see the people in
the village the Royal folk who are the
majority can only deal with the world&#39;s
markets through this small group in the
city and that&#39;s the problem the small
group in the city sits around and hopes
somebody discovers some new mineral in
Ghana because that&#39;s the only time they
make any money windows the deal is going
through take the 10% and that&#39;s their
life life&#39;s earnings and they&#39;re lucky
in my time ho the dam was built ah
that&#39;s when I built my houses and paid
my children&#39;s school fees in the absence
of that really what are they going to do
so we forget that it has to be a way to
bypass that bottleneck and give power to
the raw folk and in doing our work with
computerized plantations we&#39;ve done okay
we&#39;ve been in the bush doing a lot of
work then two things happened the
internet came wonderful now then the
mobile phones came internet is spreading
mobile phones are spreading even faster
now the problem we have is that two
things why are we bothering with all
this you know I truly wish we still
didn&#39;t have to deal with any public
sector contracted I am hoping that
people in my part of the world become so
rich that I&#39;m busy computerizing
somebody&#39;s essential oils farm it&#39;s far
more convenient the less bribes to deal
with there&#39;s less hassle it&#39;s more
straightforward so that the ultimate
goal is to ensure that people in our
countries get wealthy and people in
America don&#39;t sit around hoping that one
day some Nigerian enterpreneur with
money might come into something in the
country then they&#39;ll get rich no when
you have your little fat free every
little factory in California you know
the people in Pittsburgh ordering your
start started manufacturing so I have a
fair idea of how manufacturing
industries work then
depending on some strange philanthropies
from far away or the World Bank - to
come and help them the people in their
country have money maybe they don&#39;t have
billions but there&#39;s a regular stream of
new $1000 revenue a day from everybody
that&#39;s how in my view countries work
it&#39;s not about these big bank things all
we need to achieve is other people in
the bush should be able to have a little
essential oils farm and make five
hundred dollars a month that&#39;s all we
need to achieve if we do that we&#39;ll go
from something like seventy dollars a
year as the earnings of the raw folk to
five hundred times twelve dollars a year
that&#39;s enough we&#39;re rich it&#39;s enough
then I can go and sell my software the
way I was selling it before and have
peace of mind this is our aim
now let&#39;s point out also that you know a
lot of our people in the Diaspora
believe the country
why does they leave the country they
cannot face a situation where you&#39;re
either a thief or you&#39;re dead poor and
they&#39;re different categories of thieves
well as to be careful here and I have
friends who work in international
organizations and after four years they
come and tell me heaven you know this is
immoral I mean what they pay me to work
in that village could really change the
fortunes of that village and let the
Toyota Landcruiser they&#39;ve given me
really if I sold it the problem of the
village resolved but that&#39;s not how the
aid is working I must have a Land
Cruiser and I must be paid my five
thousand dollars a month and that&#39;s how
it works and this is the problem that it
can constitute now another problem that
a ton cost is we were looking for a big
contract in Ghana my company and ran
into a big problem with the aid group we
were we won the bid guess who showed up
of the European countries we&#39;re
competing against a company from one of
their countries it walked up and said hi
you know the grants we gave to Ghana
government good you say our people are
too expensive and they&#39;ve lost the
tender no problem
use our grants we gave you last year to
pay for it if now hi Herman sorry you
want the bid but you know hey
they&#39;ve given us free money so good hell
what am I supposed to do with my workers
I was gonna be I mean what does it match
up being gone in six at I mean so a lot
of people leave because of that now ah
another one points of interest so when
these things are happening what happens
to local industry we sit around and it&#39;s
like watching a movie new government
empower give the contracts to the German
companies German companies give them
kickback kickback funds next election
when you through democracy into the mix
makes it even more complicated because
then they have money for the elections
they win the next lettuce you say
democracy is a bad thing no I&#39;m just
saying what the reality is then they
will win the next election because they
have the biggest war chest and then
fodder for the German company and I&#39;m
not I&#39;m saying Germany just as a you
know a German company they have their
cousins also who need nice holiday type
jobs in Africa they all work in a whole
bunch of you know a brick bricklayers
out of Germany walk into Ghana living in
first-class $5,000 a month housing and
that kind of thing who&#39;s paying for this
Tsar grandchildren is either a loan or
grant in the event it&#39;s alone then we
are paying for it long term in inventor
grant then I&#39;m sorry for the taxpayers
in Germany because the government is
giving up money that half of which is
going to some African bureaucrats pocket
and the other half is paying for
holidays for some of their citizens it
doesn&#39;t make sense for anyone
see okay now I&#39;m going to try and talk
about the solution okay this is the way
I see it I&#39;m a technology person I want
peace I want to live a decent life and
not to be a thief I want to live out
that Africa it&#39;s not dignified for an
African in my view to spend the whole
life working abroad so dignified work
when but when I go to Europe and I&#39;m
hanging out with my European friends I&#39;m
proud that I live in Africa I&#39;ll be
embarrassed for them to say hi heaven
you&#39;re back here it&#39;s not good it&#39;s too
embarrassing I can&#39;t deal with this it
will think I&#39;m responsible and I will
I&#39;ve left my continent to go to hell and
and I&#39;m Europe with them now so as for
me and maybe leave this a horrible wound
I&#39;m being shot at or something I might
leave but for now I can survive so I&#39;ll
stay but in staying as to make sure my
children don&#39;t have the indignity of
being forced to leave now this is the
way I see it we&#39;re working on a project
I think is very interesting and that&#39;s
what really the main thrust of my thing
is I want to discuss with you
we&#39;re looking at having the internet
exists looking at having partners and
we&#39;re already working on this who own
websites where we&#39;re from the rocky
rough oak and I think people really
don&#39;t want to be on H they really want
to be able to end their own living there
just isn&#39;t a conduit for them to do it
thank God for the internet there is now
a marketing opportunity such that
organisations can set up have 3,000
rural people and with their wares
pictures of their wares and African hats
African drums African whatever and
medicines cocoa butter stuff like that
on display this has been around for some
time what we think we are adding to the
game it&#39;s a viable payment system
traditionally I&#39;m from West Africa so
I&#39;ve heard about for one night
so for that reason it&#39;s very difficult
to have the traditional money movement
systems work with us they&#39;re just not
Africa friendly I&#39;ve done a business
before where after 9/11 all our payment
systems were cut now we&#39;re working I can
see everything when we&#39;re working on a
payment system that&#39;s all circumvent
that what that would mean is that if I
were a villager in Ghana and I could
make African carvings I could take a day
out and go to the nearest city sign up
with some agency that allows me to put a
picture of my whatever whereas on the
site maybe one dollar a month or
something like that because he&#39;ll have
tons of them on the site then what
happens
thank God for mobile phones even when
I&#39;m in the rural area deep in the bush I
have a mobile phone at any point an
order can be communicated to me delivery
dates which product when is expected
etcetera etcetera then on that date or
near enough reality realistically I will
deliver to a certain point to a
freighter who will move the product to
wherever Sweden Kenya etc etc and the
payments will come through the system
that we&#39;re working which is a text
message based payment system it doesn&#39;t
even include if we&#39;re worried about the
the axis of evil between the
government&#39;s and telecoms it runs on the
text messaging system but we are setting
up a platform that kind of doesn&#39;t
necessarily work with
it&#39;s just they just carry a text message
that the technology of it does not
include the telephone company getting
into the payments this is what we are
trying to achieve so African crafts
medicines music as tokens musicians in
Ghana a dire situation they have no
access to the global market they have no
way of getting paid I think that once
there&#39;s a way to get paid I selected
another channel the heart the lazy
people everywhere but the hard working
people people can organize themselves
will go out and do what they need to do
to access that money I think this is
what is going to change Africa not the
age not the you know the eight has been
coming the same way for 50 years
hasn&#39;t made a difference clearly the
formalized round I think that if they
each group want to help Africans my
personal opinion is that they should
work at having the West removed create
barriers so when we unleash the rural
folk they can actually export okay the
other thing I&#39;d like to add for the
eight community you want to help us take
out the subsidies spend all your money
lobbying against subsidies because the
next thing we&#39;re going to have is
African farmers producing because now
they can get paid bypassing the
government but they won&#39;t be allowed
into the market they&#39;ll be allows it to
the market but governments in those
markets will be subsidizing that allows
us to screw them up so these are the two
things we need to work on I think if
these things happen
Africa will need help from anybody we
are resourceful we as individuals as
families as so and so our little
businesses will run what do I expose and
we won&#39;t come to the city and we won&#39;t
come and disturb anybody in Europe in
America with a visa request and we&#39;ll
have peace thank you very much
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
both amazing
we&#39;re gonna one and take her to two
questions for Herman from from the
audience
does anyone disagree with a with any
maybe from a she burger from from
African members of the audience I think
questions rousing she&#39;s a foot yes from
from a mic back here and then one one of
the person please you see the mic back
over here right coming in love us that
was a provocative talk very very
interesting to you that&#39;s that that
payment system sounds and we&#39;ll get rich
too it&#39;s not such a chariot very rich
and your total yeah generation Armani
Hammond I think your talk was great and
I agree about unleashing the power of
the rural people but I&#39;m a public health
doctor and the market isn&#39;t going to
treat the people with HIV yes
Dotson imagined so in addition to the
two things I think we also need to deal
with that okay maybe maybe a bit of a
capitalist but I think money is the
solution to everything the reason why
they don&#39;t have eight hundred thousand
dollar-a-year doctors in the village is
that the end goal cash you give them
cash they won&#39;t make anything from the
government in either school they will
hire teachers and builder school the
beginning of everything for the poorer
folk is cash
you know the UM the economist Hans
Rosling that hit tedster who has been
referred to several times showed in his
famous TED talk analysis about the
different countries he did make a
statement that appears to disagree with
that where he he compared countries
who&#39;d focused first on health and those
who&#39;d focused first on the market he
basically said his conclusion was it&#39;s
smart to get healthy first and that that
drives wealth rather than the other way
around
one man&#39;s opinion I&#39;ll tell you where
the problem is with that when you have
no cash you&#39;ll be chasing help about
three generations five generations 200
years 300 years funding it will never
have health you need cash to buy health
health is not free one more question
yeah
the mic isn&#39;t work what just shout
that&#39;s it alright thank you very much
thank you so much
