in seventh grade I decided my parents
decide to send me to public school so
I&#39;m in athletics you&#39;re in basketball
you&#39;re trying out all the sports so they
asked me to join the track team at first
I was like um no way because I&#39;m not
going to run like that is not for me
that&#39;s not my favorite sport but it was
like no you can throw the shot put and
discus I said ok let me go home ask my
parents and so I asked my dad my dad
asked me to try for the track team can I
try out he said who asked you what they
say what to ask you how they ask you and
I&#39;m like wait wait right like why are
you asking me all these questions like I
don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but at that
time I did not know the weight of the
expectations were expected of me once I
started tracking field my dad was a
silver medalist in the 1984 Olympics in
the mid-south plate so so he wanted to
make sure that if I made this decision
to step into this field that is going to
be my decision and this is what I wanted
to do and not what people expected me to
do or wanted me to do and then from that
day on my dad has been my coach ever
since so along the journey of this road
to become the first American woman to
win a gold medal in the shotput for Team
USA I had to learn some things along the
way
I was always daddy&#39;s little girl you do
as you told I follow directions but
somewhere along the way I was like you
know what I&#39;m not really quite happy
with how things are going and I&#39;m tired
of people telling me what to do I don&#39;t
want to do what I want to do so in 2013
I made it to world championships
I was fourth place by a centimeter and I
hit the same distance three times so my
feelings were hurt
I was so hurt but then in that moment I
realized Michelle you have to stand up
and take responsibility for decisions
you made and for decisions you did not
make because I was listening to what
everybody else wanted me to do and what
they expected from me
but I never said
down and realize okay Michelle is just
what you want to do or do you even think
this is best for you to do and so I
became CEO of me and it meant that I had
to trust that I actually knew what I was
talking about I had been throwing the
shoplift for over 12 years at that time
and I learned some stuff along the way I
knew what works for me what didn&#39;t work
for me but I was scared to make those
decisions because there were all these
high expectations of me and what
everybody else wanted me to do but then
I realize you know Michelle you know
what you&#39;re doing you go for it
I&#39;m an individual sports so my result is
a direct reflection of what I do and
what I don&#39;t do so I made my goals I
talked to my dad like you know that you
know I&#39;m kind of the leader here and
some there are some things I would like
to change and we sat down we had those
hard discussions and we made the changes
that I felt was necessary for me to be
the best that I can be and then we
passed 40 to 2016 I am the Olympic
champion for 2016 but with it I learned
that I have to take charge of myself and
be the leader of me because I can&#39;t lead
myself how can I lead others thank you
myself powerful I love the energy in the
front row here
well my past the leadership took a
dramatic change when about 17 years ago
November 19th of 2000 in the backcountry
snowboarding I was laying on my back on
the snow-covered Hill looking up at a
Southern Colorado sky and I had one
question on my mind where was my
snowboard and why did I not know where
that was I&#39;ve started to think back on
on what had just taken place I thought
okay I remember being at the top of the
same snow-covered Hill deciding to flip
my first backflip on a snowboard as I
was sliding down that hill I decided
whatever you do do not under rotate this
backflip so as I hit that lip I decided
my feet as hard as I could and with that
the jump threw me way farther than I
expected i over rotated the backflip I
did a one-and-a-half landing directly on
what I would later learn was a four foot
boulder underneath the snow as I
impacted the rock a shock wave I liked
getting it to an electric strong rang
throughout my body and the feeling of
numbness overtook my lower half and as
my friends ran over after I screamed out
of shock I finally got to ask them where
was my snowboard my friends looked at me
and collectively said it&#39;s on your feet
and I knew in that moment that I just
become paralyzed now as an athlete all
of my life from the Year five years old
to seventeen when I broke my back it was
like putting a bird in a cage it was the
absolute worst thing that could have
happened to somebody like myself who
celebrated using her body and I couldn&#39;t
imagine what it would be like being
somebody with a disability I knew my
athletic life was over I couldn&#39;t
imagine being a successful educated
young woman I thought all of my dreams
of playing Olympic softball and
representing the United States and
fastpitch softball was over and for two
years I operated under this terrible
attitude I looked at everything that I
couldn&#39;t do and I counted the things I
actually decided one day I would
probably never be a breakdancer and
that&#39;s sad that was never going to
happen anyways but that was my attitude
and I operated with such a negative
energy about me
it wasn&#39;t until one day I was rolling
through the gym at the University of New
Mexico that I came across five on five
wheelchair basketball and I loved it and
the best part about it was it was
violent
these people are smashing into each
other falling over getting up shooting
three-point shots in a chair and I was
moved and I thought there was no way I
could be an athlete again until I saw
this with my own eyes
and all of a sudden my competitive
spirit kicked back in I decided I didn&#39;t
care how many legs the guy next to me
was missing I was going to beat him down
the court and I did and I shot farther
and I was more accurate than anybody on
that court eventually and that&#39;s just a
testament to what our minds can do I
started looking at what the things that
I could do as opposed to what I couldn&#39;t
do and now as a five-time paralympian
three-time gold medalist the first
female American to win gold in the
summer in winter games most importantly
a female leader in the Paralympic
movement I&#39;ve decided that leadership is
about being open-minded it&#39;s about being
creative in your workplace and being
able to adapt to your unique challenges
and it&#39;s about getting up every time you
fall down it&#39;s about resiliency thank
[Applause]
oh wow so we have a couple questions for
you all and um and I mean I&#39;m just in
awe standing up here next to you and I
think one thing that it&#39;s so hard for
all of us to imagine what it takes to
become the kind of champions that you
both are so I&#39;d love to know what drives
you let&#39;s start with you Michelle well
for me I wouldn&#39;t want to let people
tell me what our sitting could not do I
knew that I could be the best and if I
worked hard I was dedicated and I did
everything that I can control to be the
best that I can be that I can do that so
I wanted to be the best that I can be so
others can know that they can be the
best that they can be and let no one put
a cap on what you&#39;re capable of doing
they make such a good answer and your
clear evidence of that true Elena you
referenced in your remarkable story that
you learned a lot about leadership and
that now you see yourself as a female
leader in the Paralympic movement
what is this experience as champions
done to your thinking about yourself as
a leader with responsibilities to women
and girls absolutely I I didn&#39;t have a
leader in my life when I first broke my
back when I was laying in the hospital
bed at 17 years old I didn&#39;t know that I
had the opportunity an option to be an
athlete still and so now as a three-time
gold medalist and somebody as a veteran
of the Paralympic Games I realized there
is a huge responsibility for me to
continue going out to lead this charge
that young women with disabilities need
to see me out there they need to see me
doing the best that I can with what I
have and you know they also need to see
me on the red carpet they need to see me
shaking the president&#39;s hand and they
need to have hope for their future they
also need to see me with a master&#39;s
degree education in my hands
well I will follow you both wherever you
want to go I want to say on behalf of
all the women in the world that your
stories are inspiring to us and to our
children and our grandchildren the role
models that we love being able to share
with the global community join us one
more time and saying thank you to these
amazing
[Applause]
