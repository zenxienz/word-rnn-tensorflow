okay quick show of hands how many of you
have ever used a bar chart a pie chart
or a graph alright to understand data
wonderful what if I told you that we&#39;re
working on a project and maybe you&#39;d be
interested in helping us on actually
converting data into objects objects
that have size and shape and color
much like your bar chart might have a
something very tall representing a large
quantity well you could make a different
shape that&#39;s big or small and colors
could mean something you could even have
textures mean something right
something&#39;s rough or something smooth
would tell us something different about
the data we can even turn data into
notes played by different instruments
and then listen to how those notes
change over time
I&#39;m working with an incredible team
doing this sort of work trying to
convert data into something more like
our lived reality something that the
human brain is good at you see the human
mind is all naturally actually amazingly
good at detecting patterns out in the
world around us so the intuition here is
we&#39;re not as equally as good and
understanding a spreadsheet think of the
last speaker Carlos talk she was talking
about all these sensors embedded in
things right the Internet of Things
these are giving out vast data streams
and the question is how do we understand
all of this data all this big data
coming in and our team believes that you
have to use all of our senses to even
begin to get around some of these
projects or problems um so I think in
the future rather than taking a dataset
and first calculating the mean median or
the mode or making a bar chart I think
will actually say welcome to the date of
room let me take this data and throw it
into a virtual reality space where all
of a sudden I can interact with these
objects and I can see new relationships
and new patterns that I hadn&#39;t seen
before so I&#39;m working with an incredible
team of Cali because we know science
progresses in collaboration with others
because there&#39;s just not enough time
for everybody to know everything right
and so I&#39;m actually a political
scientist and I wanted to use these
tools to help understand war so I&#39;ll be
talking about that in a second data into
notes we can actually convert individual
bits of data and tell the data every
time event number two comes up play a
c-sharp with a trumpet and every time
event number three comes up play a D
with a with an oboe or something and
then we can actually listen to the
trends over time and see what we can
learn in the future your job might
include listening to a real-time data
feed in a lab maybe you work in national
security in the future
and you&#39;re listening to cyber threat
traffic this can all be condensed down
and this could actually form a
persistent audio landscape that
represents your working world something
that you come to recognize when you go
to work right oh yeah that sounds sort
of familiar it sort of lays down a track
a baseline pattern like oh yeah I know
that tune that&#39;s like an average day at
the office such that when something&#39;s
strange
you&#39;ll hear it really quick right you&#39;ll
be able to turn and stay wait what&#39;s
going on with this data I&#39;m not quite
sure let me check and look into it so
we&#39;re going to perceptual eyes the data
set that I collected on the angle and
more I&#39;m really interested in
understanding more dynamics and this
started when I was a Peace Corps
volunteer living in southern Africa in
the late 1990s I was actually very
embarrassed and ashamed when I started
talking to people on the ground because
I realized I didn&#39;t know about a
horrific war taking place in Angola just
a few miles from my house so became
really important to me to collect
stories from school teachers and
students and truck drivers everybody
along the border that I could find and I
ended up creating an event data set of
the battles and massacres that took
place in the Angolan war actually it was
a historiography of the entire 40 year
long war a story told from beginning to
end
so I was really excited to visualize it
and then a little bit depressed because
I didn&#39;t really have the right tools yet
because you see this two-dimensional
flat map that I started out creating it
doesn&#39;t really tell the story it doesn&#39;t
sort of recover the stories that I&#39;ve
learned from two years of coding all
right I put a lot of work into it and I
became somewhat knowledgeable about what
happened in the war but it always
disturbed me when someone said hey tell
me the story of Angolan war I prefer to
blank chalkboard to this I felt like the
data should be able to talk or we should
be able to see how one event links to
the next working with a team at single
ethics my friend Dave Warner created for
me
this comprehensive view and for the
first time I could actually see the
angle and war data that I&#39;d collected I
was so excited I could see errors and
missing data I could see new patterns
iterations back and forth between
different combatants competing in terms
of the massacres that they were
committing all kinds of interesting
things it&#39;s a three dimensional space in
which time is on a z axis going up and
then I worked with Robert Alexander to
sana Phi the angle and war data some
10,000 events over time so I said okay
every time there&#39;s a battle let&#39;s play
this note we&#39;re gonna listen to some of
this every time you hear these are that
many battles massacres taking place in
the war so give it you know the due
respect it deserves because it
represents real human casualties and the
trosset ease and the very real loss of
life one thing that I want you to pay
attention to is a loud clap sound this
is the day that the election results in
1992 came out there was you see there
was hope was high and Angola at this
time that maybe we would get out of this
mess through an election both could the
combatants agreed let&#39;s lay down our
weapons and see if we can&#39;t solve this
peacefully and while we know that this
is a hopeful time in society we also
know that elections are really dangerous
potentially very dangerous and deeply
divided societies right
when the rules are crafted like the
winner gets to take everything and the
losers go home with nothing it&#39;s a
really dangerous time so we&#39;ll listen
and see and I want to hear it notice
what patterns you hear that&#39;s the day
the election results came out that Big
Bang
losers went on a rampage not wanting to
believe they really lost and actually
ushered in the worst period of the war
some two years long of absolute
nightmare dangling people every time you
hear that angelic sound are those chimes
that ceasefire negotiations peace talks
going on which makes you wonder where
these being negotiated in good faith or
were they simply a ruse to gain better
tactical advantage and positioning on
the battlefield I&#39;m a professor at John
Carroll University and I talked to
students a lot who really want to work
in the area of peace building and
conflict resolution and I believe the
best way to do that is to really
understand conflicts why they happened
wars why they happened very carefully by
reading as much as you can taking
classes looking at the theories and then
gathering all the data and evidence and
using a large variety of techniques to
understand the data collecting stories
is also very very important and perhaps
the most important sonification isn&#39;t a
magic bullet Carol solution but it in a
toolkit that&#39;s quite large if it&#39;s used
in combination with other methodologies
might help lead us to some new
discoveries thanks
[Applause]
amazing I can ask you a question sure
let&#39;s meet you so what will perceptual
ization look like in 20 years well I
think of very last two talks right
before me and I think of sort of a
mash-up of all of those things where you
have a virtual reality space that I
imagine I don&#39;t know I&#39;m just guessing
no one knows it would be like in 20
years but I imagine we&#39;ll have a data
layer floating over our heads we will no
longer have it&#39;ll look so old-fashioned
and cute all these cellphones we carry
with us I think our computers will be
bet embedded in our objects and then
there&#39;ll be somehow in our eyes so if I
see somebody and I almost forget their
name I can I&#39;ll see hovering Oh his name
is Rhys and you met him in Ted in 2015
you&#39;ll have that magic data layer
floating and then I think when you get
data that you want to analyze you&#39;ll go
into these data rooms and you&#39;ll do
analysis and then hopefully also you can
actually use it for predictive analytics
in the future you know how you come to
almost anticipate where a song is going
like if you hear a jazz song playing you
think yeah I kind of feel the general
groove no matter how many riffs and
variations maybe it can&#39;t exactly
predict the next note but you can kind
of feel or trajectory to with these
sonification zyou almost it almost gets
to the point where you could say all
right let&#39;s play a place a bet and see
if I press pause could I guess the next
note and I think maybe in 20 years
they&#39;ll be kind of figuring out the
groove of sonification and perceptual
ization thanks everybody thank you thank
you
