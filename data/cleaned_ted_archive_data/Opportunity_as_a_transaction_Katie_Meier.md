you know that game two truths and a lie
where I tell you two truths and one lie
and you have to figure out which is
which here they are the church made me
smarter to keep you safe in case I lived
with the Mafia I can spot great
opportunities all right well given i
have six minutes i&#39;m going to tell you
which is which the church did make me
smarter but if you&#39;ve ever been to the
mega church this might seem like the
contradiction i remember parking one
time and a mega church being helped by
an armada of happy volunteers really
good hair really cute orange vests and
little orange flags navigating me
through thousands of rows of parking in
order to find a spot a parking shuttle
took me to the sanctuary and I walked up
there next to a fake river that has been
built into the sidewalk leading up to
the front doors the vibe at the
megachurch screams now entertainment
works by getting the most basic message
out to as many people as possible a
religious message in that context has to
be pretty uncomplicated I remember
feeling like I had learned all the lines
of that message I really used to love
receiving there I needed to know how my
belief things like having a soul or
loving a divine being things that are
pretty radical by contrast to what we
believe you have everyday world how they
work what is a soul what&#39;s the
difference between being really really
wise and being divine
I felt him not knowing these answer so I
sought them out in order to answer these
questions i became a religious
philosopher at UC Berkeley I had to
change many of my belief I lost many
friends and though it didn&#39;t happen all
at once I think it was the scope of what
I was willing to explore that was the
hardest part for people to understand
because you can&#39;t control what you learn
when you start to explore I did live
with the Mafia that&#39;s true also when I
began exploring and okay caveat it first
it&#39;s not like the mafia mafia like you
see in movies it&#39;s like two local mafia
of like like a major city here&#39;s how
that happened I had a friend I thought
it was a mild-mannered scholar turns out
she&#39;s a political revolutionary she had
done a public ceremony to burn her cast
she was publishing radical poetry I
stayed with a friend of hers from that
era we gon a very different direction
after they achieved some measure of
success and here i would just like to
caution you you never know who you are
having lattes with at starbucks during
college aight i lived at the Mafia her
friend he&#39;s like 50 Yves paunchy total
sweetheart but then something morally
rough would happen for me he would come
home some days unload rupees into the
kitchen cabinets like he was building a
lightweight wall this seemed to be
connected to building projects he would
take me out to like little bridges and
stuff but in far-off towns by this point
I&#39;m totally committed to exploring I&#39;m
think the two are connected I asked my
friend she confirms it I think this is
complicated I like right and wrong black
and white gray or the middle it&#39;s the
hardest place for me
I don&#39;t get to decide how great it gets
either pretty sure what he was doing was
illegal but he was doing good little
project so i don&#39;t think most
governments would care about I know what
she was doing was legal but we were
drinking lattes and getting graduate
degrees what&#39;s the better opportunity to
effect change I had to learn to play
with the shades of gray in order to
figure out one I could live with so by
now you know what the lie is I cannot
Spock the opportunities I&#39;ve done tons
of things that should have been like
being in the megachurch which could have
made me powerful or becoming a scholar
at Berkeley which could have made me
esteemed that&#39;s what i think of
opportunity is a transaction by contrast
somebody once told me look for the next
best clue the best life I can think of
functions this way truths and lies
become tuning knobs to adjust the gray
area if we look for clues rather than
opportunities we don&#39;t have to listen so
hard for takeaways in bullet points so
teachers gonna lie the church made me
harder I lived with the Mafia I can&#39;t
spot a great opportunity but that&#39;s how
I got here I just looked for the next
best clue I know I didn&#39;t know it I was
looming to tune the day peace
