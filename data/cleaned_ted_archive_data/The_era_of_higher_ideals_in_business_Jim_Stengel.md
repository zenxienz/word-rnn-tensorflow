I come before you today in this
courtroom to make the case that it&#39;s
time to change the story of business
it&#39;s time for a new narrative and the
stakes and this are high three billion
people of the seven billion on our
planet work in the world of business but
my story today is also one about
personal inspiration and how it can come
to you in the most unwelcome times and
in the most trying times and I&#39;m going
to start my TED talk today with a story
about someone who inspired me to see
this news story in business so very
clearly
so there we go I&#39;m going to speak today
about my younger brother Bob he&#39;s the
little guy in that funky stroller that
I&#39;m sure I do did not design we are from
a family of six children I was number
three and Bob was number four and he was
the classic shadow little brother the
classic tag along everywhere I went he
went with me we shared a bedroom for all
of our childhood in the third floor of
our home and we would play crazy
mathematical sports games well into the
night and talk until my father climb
those stairs every night about midnight
and shut us down well this little guy
grew up to be the most amazing physician
he went to the John Hopkins University
and was a star chemistry student he then
went on to the University of Pittsburgh
Medical School and could have chosen any
specialty but he chose family medicine
and he returned to his hometown of
Lancaster Pennsylvania to set up his
life and set up his practice well I love
returning to my hometown and running
into his patients in fact they seek you
out they burst with energy about this
guy they can&#39;t wait to tell you about
his diagnostic abilities about how he
makes connections how he sees things
others don&#39;t which results in people
getting better and many stories of lives
saved but more powerfully they talk
about how he treats people and how he
treats patients how he&#39;s fully engaged
when people come to see him about its
generosity his kindness his listening is
empathy they tell stories about coming
in for a procedure and exam and he never
starts with that he starts with talking
about their family their hobbies the
community what they&#39;re passionate about
they tell me he never has a bad day
there&#39;s never a mean comment
he is the finest human being I have ever
met well in August 30th 2001 I got a
phone call late at night and Bob called
me to tell me he had leukemia and his
voice was shaky but he was concerned
about how I was taking the news that
night and of course Bob being Bob he
diagnosed in himself his back at eight
for a few days hit a low grade fever he
couldn&#39;t bring down so he went in for
blood work well August was also the
month I was appointed to one of the
greatest jobs in all of business the
global marketing officer for Procter &amp;
Gamble the world&#39;s largest advertiser by
far and the most influential consumer
goods company in the world well you know
what it&#39;s like when you get calls like
that many of you in this room have had
that experience when a loved one calls
with news like that it turns everything
upside down as you know well suddenly
this job I was so eager to jump into I
had worked my career for this kind of
job suddenly seemed very meaningless
very trivial here I go to work to grow
Procter and Gamble&#39;s mighty brands while
my brother was fighting day in and day
out to be a very very tough disease well
that night I chatted with my wife we
talked about what we should do what we
could do of course we would open up our
lives more to be with them in this time
with Bob and his wife and his family our
whole family but I thought more deeply I
thought about maybe I should take a
leave of absence to be with him more to
be with them to open up my life more for
them and I mentioned that to Bob and you
can guess his reaction oh come on Jim
I&#39;ll be fine don&#39;t do that keep doing
what you love we&#39;re also very proud of
you
well we were so close growing up but we
were really different I was the
extrovert bob was the introvert he was
science I was humanities he was straight
A&#39;s I was class clown and he returned to
his hometown the set of his life and I
travel the world for PNG but you know
over the years in so many ways and
emails and handwritten notes and phone
calls he would tell me how very proud he
was of me and what I was doing with my
life and now I had this intense feeling
I wanted to make him even prouder so we
went to visit him after that call when
we spent a long weekend with Bob he was
already in the hospital hemotherapy math
era p had already started and we chatted
we talked we watched TV we and i
returned to cincinnati after that long
weekend with my wife i went back to work
and I thought and I thought and you know
suddenly something came to me and I said
I thought to myself why don&#39;t I take
this big wonderful job I just was
appointed to and reimagine it with my
brother in mind what if I dedicated this
job to him in a way what if I thought
about him every day when I went to work
what if he was in the room with me in
every meeting every phone call every
engagement what if I could approach this
job with the values and principles he
held so dearly what if I could make him
even prouder so let&#39;s think for a moment
what was going on in august two thousand
and one in the world around us well a
dot-com bubble had just burst 911
happened about ten days later google
this three year old company not yet
public was starting to change how we all
live our lives and do our work Apple had
just introduced the ipod and had just
opened their first retail store and the
Millennials this Cove
work and I&#39;m a parent of two of them was
reaching their teenage years and my
company Procter &amp; Gamble was deeply
thinking how and why we do business with
a new management team in place so it was
an incredible confluence of events and I
didn&#39;t know it at the time but the
age-old story of business was unraveling
and you all know that story as well as I
do hierarchies command and control
sacrifice anything to hit the quarterly
number win lose closed systems this was
all coming apart and look at the
companies that fell in that decade
somehow the business companies like AIG
Bear Stearns sears and meanwhile there
was a new breed of companies arising the
innocence out of the UK the Emirates out
of the Middle East the Zappos and of
course the googles and apples so I began
to think with all of this in mind all of
this going on in my head in this new job
I began to think what if businesses
could be much more about building deep
authentic relationships and to do that
sincerely and authentically what if
businesses new metaphor was
relationships what if we thought about
generosity and giving and service and
passion and making a difference what if
leaders set their sights higher what if
it was more about purpose and mission
and ideals what if in this age of
emerging social networks they were just
starting we could listen better so what
if business could be simply put more
about how my brother approached his life
well this casual exploration which I
began to work on and implement and think
about and try it PNG led to a personal
quest for me and it did leave me to
leave the company that I so loved and
for 25 years I wanted to pursue this
with one hundred percent of my time and
freedom and passion and energy so I dove
into it after I left in 2008 I started
teaching I started writing I visited
hundreds of people to talk to them about
what they believed and then he actually
are in this room people like Scott Cook
people like Lori coots and Lee clown
david outsole and i learned and learned
and learned as much as i could and what
was clear to me so clear that a new
story was emerging and this story was
happening at a time when one voice could
bring down a regime when one voice could
change a corporate decision when people
around the world so called consumers
we&#39;re really changing how they buy and
what they buy and how they cared look at
some data the show this shift from the
old story to the new nineteen percent of
Americans trust big business that is
dreadful and by the way that number is
number is similar in other countries
around the world thirty percent of
people feel engaged passionate energized
and bring their whole selves to work
again a dreadful number and now shifting
to the news story and some positive zhem
and optimism here sixty-four percent of
high-performing companies say corporate
character is a major driver of their
success well I would suggest we are
entering a new era and I call it the era
of higher ideals this is the new story
this is the new narrative and in my mind
it is the only way forward now when I
say ideals you know I mean why you exist
a higher order Bennett that you bring to
the world how you attract talent and
this comes from the beliefs and the
values of the organization it&#39;s so often
rooted in the Heritage here are three
lovely examples of ideals based
companies
lindt the lovely chocolate company out
of Zurich their ideal is simply to bring
joy to people through small luxuries and
met methods you know the great home care
company out of San Francisco their ideal
is to be catalyst for a healthy happy
revolution in home care and petrobras
the large brazilian energy company they
exist for the sustainable development of
Brazil and all companies they operate in
now this ideal is important it&#39;s
critical it&#39;s the first step but it&#39;s
only the beginning the ideal must drive
everything it must drive the behavior
right it has to drive the rituals the
systems the processes of a company of
the culture and it must influence the
communication that happens inside the
company and outside and all of that has
to be coherent and of course it has to
impact the experience people have with
our brands and must then cascade down
through the measurement and evaluation
systems so we&#39;re Ted we&#39;re dreaming
we&#39;re exuberant with the ideas we&#39;re
talking about but maybe here even a TED
in this environment this sounds a bit
dreamy a bit lofty a bit idealistic if
you will for the tough world of business
well I&#39;m very confident this is the new
story and I&#39;ll tell you why I
commissioned some research a few years
ago the company called Miller Brown
large global research company they have
the best database of brands in the world
50,000 brands and I asked them and it
goes back about 20 years ask them to cut
the data for the last 10 years and I
wanted to look at the top 50 brands who
had moved the most in affinity with
their customers and also moved the most
in financial wealth creation and here&#39;s
what I found they were ideals base by
and large these 50 brands mission-based
and over that 10-year period they
outperformed financially in
shareholder return they outperformed the
S&amp;P 500 by four hundred percent and they
grew 32 time ten times faster than their
competition so let&#39;s look at very
quickly two companies from that top 50
and the first is discovery
communications you all know them 28
years old founded by John Hendricks the
largest nonfiction media company in the
world for to have billion in sales and
their ideal has always been to satisfy
the curiosity about the universe or the
multiverse all around us I spent several
days with that company in my research
and I asked the head of HR what this
curiosity means you and she said to me
I&#39;m simple every year on employee work
plans we asked them to pick one
attribute related curiosity and make
progress against it that year second
company i love this one we heard the
mayor of Rio de Janeiro talk about this
company yesterday IBM it&#39;s it shows you
can do it in large complex public
companies and their ideal you all know
it is to create a smarter planet now
John a lotta one of their senior leaders
when I asked him what this means to him
he said when we embrace this our
language changed and our measurements
changed so this is so compelling if this
works why aren&#39;t we moving faster what&#39;s
going on well I think we&#39;ve a big
barrier and I think that barrier is very
simple we don&#39;t bring our whole selves
to work we don&#39;t bring our whole cells
and we don&#39;t bring our whole brain
Daniel pink accelerated the discussion
about the power and the potential of
bringing our whole brain to work we know
it we simply must get on with it we need
to roll model it ourselves we need to
expect it from our people we need to
reward it and we need to talk about it a
lot I want to share too provocative
short stories about my days at P&amp;G about
the power and potential of bringing your
whole brain to work
when I went into this great new job and
I approached it in the way I just talked
about I traveled a lot of course and i
met with employees and training sessions
at dinners at lunches and i used to ask
them why do you go home at night and on
weekends and do incredible things in
your community and with your
organization&#39;s you&#39;re passionate about
why are you bringing that to work why
aren&#39;t you doing that work through our
brands why don&#39;t you bring that passion
that mentality well they didn&#39;t feel
like we expected it and when we
liberated that amazing stuff started to
happen and it happened on brands like
pampers and like always and tied an
aerial and downy Lenore and even Charmin
and old spice and by the way the results
changed second story we feel of some
groundbreaking research among the people
who bought our brands consumers and we
we they could tell from the signals we
were sending that if the people behind
each of the brands were passionate
loving their work engaged in it so can
you imagine the implications of that
okay so let&#39;s take a deep breath deep
yoga breath through the stomach relax
for a moment and let&#39;s dream let&#39;s just
dream from 0 temp you&#39;re comfortable
close your eyes and like you to dream a
little bit about the ideas we&#39;ve just
been talking about for the last 15
minutes what if this became a movement
what if the exceptions we&#39;re talking
about the innocence and the methods and
the zappos and the IBM&#39;s what if they
became the norm what would that look
like and what would that feel like
so look around this room here three
billion people are involved in the world
of business what if all of us and some
large percentage of that three billion
adopted this new narrative this new
story how would organizations change how
would innovation change how an
advertisement change how a business
change on November fourth 2010 my
brother Bob died of leukemia and his
spirit wasn&#39;t ready to go his son had
just graduated from college and by the
way talk about pride was on his way to
medical school had a daughter still in
college and his son in high school well
his body was worn out after nine years
of fighting that very tough disease but
his spirit was still vital bob loved the
nickname I had growing up it was
bestowed on me given to me by an old
Irish uncle a very funny one and Bob
chocolate at it often it was champ the
nickname was champ well the last time I
saw my brother was the day before he
died and I was leaving his bedside in
the hospital and I went over who&#39;s very
heavily sedated and I went over to him
and I kissed him on the head and I
whispered in his ear I said to him Bob I
love you I said Bob you are the real
champ and you know what he did his body
came out of that bed the nurses were
blown away because he hadn&#39;t moved much
and he came toward me he lifted his
shoulders up
I thought my god he&#39;s always about
others even until the end so my brother
Bob in ways i had no idea at the time
and i don&#39;t think he ever fully realized
was and is my inspiration he helped me
see a very different world of business
and actually to approach my business
life in a very very different way and
with a different spirit so i&#39;d like to
invite you this morning to join in this
new story to join in this new narrative
and i&#39;d like to end with a few
suggestions on how to get started or if
you&#39;re doing it how to accelerate your
momentum and the first one is you must
articulate your ideal it must be
explicit you must talk about it it&#39;s
amazing to me in my travels in my
research and my consulting leaders don&#39;t
do this and has to be by the way
inspirational and really engaging to
your employees your people so it has to
be articulate it has to be explicit and
it must attract talent it must bring
people to you but doesn&#39;t work
internally it will never work externally
it has to be authentic and the third
suggestion and this is the most
important one when times are tough
everyone will be watching your behavior
you have to live this ideal when times
are good and when times are tough that&#39;s
the magic behind it
so I&#39;ve committed my life to this new
ideal this new way this news story and
I&#39;d love to invite you to act on it and
to act now it&#39;s urgent it&#39;s big it&#39;s
important I&#39;d like to welcome you to
join this new story but let&#39;s not join
it as players or actors I&#39;d like to
invite you to join it as leaders thank
you very much
so do we have a question one question we
do how do you stick to your ideals at
times like these which seem
contradictory to what the capital market
is currently measuring like shareholder
value and a brief on this it&#39;s not
contradictory if you want to get to
shareholder value you act debate and
operate against your ideals that&#39;s the
way that&#39;s what my research shows okay
so I want us to vote now with our heads
not not our hearts on this question is
the case made that a business strategy
of higher ideals will actually help you
win in business in the future I believe
that&#39;s a fair way to phrase the rod on
proposition those who think case not
carried raise their hands not carried
we&#39;ll talk afterward those who think the
case carried raise their hands Jim you
are out of jail thank you for that thank
you Chris thank you thank you very one
[Applause]
