thank you very much you&#39;re a good
audience really beautiful audience
now Africa has stopped talking Africa
asked to do practical solutions we took
away the colonialists that&#39;s a gun case
we should not go back to that and
therefore my area is on practical
solutions to solving African problems
and I got a number of technologies that
I&#39;m going to show you which are working
beautifully well and my areas that have
been concerned with a definitely slum
areas and she becomes all over the horn
and eastern part of Africa and therefore
have second playing small playing to
triple the plane to make sure that our
people lead a good life look at Aslam
the some of the things that you&#39;ll
always be hearing housing water supply
was of you now look at the projections
the year 2020 there 2030
billions of people will living in slums
look at that map let me push you in that
map that Africa alone is not the only
continent having refugees and Sunday
slum people in Kenya for example look at
those Islam areas Cuba has been talked
about here since I came here and that is
because it is the biggest Nam in Africa
I look at it from the air now that
brings the point where has the chemical
engineer worked if you look at those
refugee comes in the Horn of Africa and
spot of Africa have laid my foot in
those areas trying to control
certain vectors that I&#39;m going to tell
you look at that picture this is free
decomp in Autopia Sudan border that&#39;s
area where I went to make sure that
people leave or lives
now what were these interventions at
attrition let me tell you personally I&#39;m
in love nature I&#39;m a chemical in you
have a loving nature you know the good
thing with nature majors what a lot of
things that if you utilize them you are
going to get a lot of benefit from it
from the soil from the waters from the
plants from the human beings the genes
we are talking about now the innovations
that are dealt with are three the Battle
of allegiances this is a bacterium that
you can find in the soil anyway this
part of the world
God created there the human being human
mind has gone there to find out what
that bacterium can do that vacuum can
call crop pests can call vectors and
producing everything else
my interest is having a African local
isolate look at the missing in that
jacqueline talked about yesterday now
russia here is a lot over at red plants
now malaria is killing thousands of our
people now nobody has taken initiative
to exploit that plant the song report
this is a patented product from a plant
which is what we call an immune aid in
win booster working very well now the
diseases this one you have had but the
most important thing about diseases is
that these are now being neglected if I
talk about malaria hiv/aids these are
being neglected but these are the ones
was killing our people most look at that
beautiful fly it&#39;s beautiful but is it
really beautiful because all those
diseases that have talked about this is
the mechanical carrier and that&#39;s what
I&#39;m against that&#39;s what I&#39;m fighting
now my interest is topping vectors from
the level stage where they hide bTW I&#39;m
talking about the bacillus Rangers have
talked about that I produce Luke&#39;s Artem
but looks at the blood level level of
the fill fly of the mosquito where they
live
you know what&#39;s interesting once you put
them there their food at the faeces the
bacteria they grow produce the toxin
which is environmentally friendly and
you never get a fly out of it if you get
a fly out of it maybe does no leg does
no food whatever that&#39;s walk around the
most important thing about this nature
products is that they are bio-friendly
put them all on your fish bones no
tadpoles will die now another enemy of
mine is this malaria the Anopheles
mosquito I&#39;m not looking at the adult
I&#39;m looking at the love on stage now
once I&#39;ve produced this technologies or
this product and look at places where I
use them to control this is an habitat
or mosquito and you can look at it and
see how invaded in firstly interested
look at those beautiful children in
Sudan it was your border and you&#39;re
talking with cheetahs these are the
cheetahs but if this let us die what
will come out of it we have to make sure
that we get rid of these mosquitoes so
this beautiful young children can grow
and the succession take over Moses role
because my time will come over now to
produce these things you need sounds and
let me cause you&#39;ll hear that and please
take it home there&#39;s nothing called
African science there is no American
science science is science
that&#39;s critical so we do culture them
through the products now this is the
engineer now using a pile of skill to do
use the material to control those
vectors now this is scientist in our 3
theta 4 seater plane arriving in a Tokyo
from Kenya called by UNHCR to go and
control the mosquitoes and the field
flies which are killing a lot of a few
lives in that area you can see at the
background the products there now very
simple technology the pit toilets were
talking about in slums that is where the
mud woods are if you go to be right now
and start walking around the mud goose
will be walking around your foot when we
enter there with my European friend in
fact she was a lady and she awluz fell
down in that area now we got scared all
the mud goes around so simple technology
you just put in the toilet the faeces as
the food for the bacteria they grow
there they produce their toxin and no
fly with kappa hot um printer said in
local materials not important and I
produce these products from local
materials starting from Kota molasses
chicken ovens the intestines the crooks
I refer to the hood amuse him not human
with food and therefore if I&#39;m missing
cow dung you can see that you can
control flies in maniatis Messiah
monitors just pray where the cows are
and no animal will kicking around now
these are my people now we have declared
war on the mosquitoes and a fifth life
they doing the control now this the
scientists in China really enjoying the
Chinese here they are referring to me as
a president of Kenya but under president
walking around but the idea I&#39;m sending
home here I thought people must interact
we are here with international people
inter
Tim how to produce the best material the
highest quality that can control the
vectors now this is narrow the area the
City Council of Nairobi has declared a
mosquito an enemy and therefore ordered
our products to do that this is a
medical doctor doing the job the next
thing innovation is the at amazing look
at the structure local mosquito what
have I done a chemical engineer had a
Tanzanian friend a medical doctor had a
German friend mechanical engineer they
came to my Institute we start together
the problem was developing a pilot
production simulation process to produce
active ingredient from this plant to
control the mosquito within two months
we had come out with a good pilot
production simulation process an
economist report now there&#39;s a plant
being put night in Nairobi now as 10
million US dollars which is going to
produce this particular drug for the
control of mosquito was a good omen for
the African people this that amazing
plant with the acting so very well very
common in Arusha this has been here for
years but nobody has ever thought of
nature as the answer to our problems now
the last innovation is the nutritive
envision call some coupons there&#39;s a
plant that is found in Kenya and we had
to sit down and look at it let me tell
you is a great immune booster a
beautiful plant look at it but whoever
who knew that that could be helped it&#39;s
my last people the scientist did it
Moses I&#39;ve come in love friends this
product now is allowed by the Kenyan
government to be used in hop stores it&#39;s
really not a drug is what we call an
immune booster special and is patented
worldwide we are now looking away of
ready
producing mass and you can see that they
crave Venus the people want to have it
the national center shil meeting the
policeman looking for it able of looking
for it
because once you take it as a food
supplement you get going now the
challanges innovators in supply my last
three prototype development is really
problem in other words once of the lab
results to scale it up to the bigger
plant of problem therefore we are
calling upon a friend from were seized
and I believe in friends because without
friends you can do much and the world
while solution is gone networking is the
order of the day the question will is
with revisions a lot of fighting as my
other sister was saying who what belongs
to who who invented it we should have
the biggest share all those problems
come in but most important is what I&#39;ve
noticed in Kenya and Africa below
intrapreneur culture the idea of taking
small things making them big fan area
that we need read waka another important
one own technologies we don&#39;t believe in
ourselves Africa mistake that our
technology must be the best math
national industries don&#39;t recognize the
innovations that means that if they
don&#39;t come and we work together because
piloting is good but to produce for
commercial skill is another step and let
me say that the misconceptions that
innovators are very intelligent people
people like phd&#39;s does not hold water an
inventor once given the good environment
innovator can come from anywhere
of course a
scientists this is one of the things
like why Felicity in Africa we just
really messed up with our innovators
because the old idea is that if
University you publish or perish don&#39;t
probably publish you don&#39;t come
professor but I&#39;m saying publish fine
what about a ten to perish patent if you
can but most important is Africa cannot
waves you produce or you perish
therefore you must balance the three
piece and the culture by four in local
is bad we must get away with it
microfinance I&#39;m talking with a number
of friends here seems to be too
expensive for people is an area that
donors can come in risk little risk
takers let me tell you frankly speaking
that Nausicaa they&#39;re very fury stickers
and we need to improve on that now the
way forward
R&amp;D activities must go on Africa cannot
stop it
but we must mix it with prototype
development reverse engineering para
take this computer tear it down
look at it look what can be made in
Kenya would convey to Tanzania make it
because current and 7% things are
important patent filing we must go out
and look at the patterns outside those
which are expired you must be able to
use them but most important also in
occupation systems we first introduced
in commission system in Africa bring the
medium small industries given the space
give them the BDS business or services
let them stay there for six months let
them Hur let them get the market move
out and become Bill Gates were frico
that is critical more important is we
must do what is called market driven
technology ideology let us not do
results for the sake of it Michael
remarks this a gentleman this is potent
Edie has put up with African scientist
and genious of the colonial era young
scientist engineers must now stand up
and be counted
number two Africa must industrialized in
whole not just part of it
I notice you get fit in the hot seat
here which came in we we have a couple
of questions please that&#39;s what on the
Artemus missin n it is your invention a
drug for treatment of malaria or is it
about malaria prevention treatment of
the malaria is a drug yeah
the idea was to get the active
ingredient out of it and then for my
tablets out of it so the plant which we
Boone put put up in Kenya now excuse me
the medicine itself right and so we were
hearing today about the does that
connect with the a B II project that&#39;s
already that we heard about yesterday
that&#39;s already operating yeah you know
the problem is the result in a stick
that people do their own things right
people do in doing things what Koreans
will be of the biological what we call
the biological Africa which are still
working on this together from Tanzania
Kenya under so from Germany okay so
first we can arrange a connection over
to bridge that gap yeah and then I was
curious on the the HIV immune booster so
this is this is again designed this is a
drug for people already who have HIV as
a not as an alternative to the expensive
Western or generic drugs correct it&#39;s
very cheap and as I say this immune
booster want to take it to the food
supplement your immune system goes up so
it&#39;s really not curing the AIDS but will
be immune boosting they white self the
intended is that positive no yeah we
have with us actually here separately
heads the International AIDS vaccine
initiative did you know about this
innovation set the I don&#39;t if you&#39;re in
the hole even hope so he can we get a
mic to Seth I just be interested in just
quick quick comment on this so he&#39;s
right he&#39;s right at the back what is it
so what is the result of it is a very
bored and the night so people are really
getting on we are putting the products
and we are how does it compare to like a
drug regime
yes we&#39;re Buddhist Israel comparable
well fukuko comparable and again very
cheap and people are taking it now in
all stores in Kenya and there were some
in West Africa is the force really good
so you&#39;re saying the performance
comparable to the drugs in the price
twice feel like I said as much a quarter
as much yeah one thief of the princess
well I think that I wasn&#39;t aware of this
particular drug and my question would be
what type of clinical studies have been
done because one of the fabulous things
about Africa is all the the native cures
that exist in the indigenous system and
the challenge is getting those into a
system tested in a placebo control trial
to show that they really work and so if
this innovation you know works it&#39;s
something that&#39;s very important and that
challenge is what are the studies that
have demonstrated its value yeah that&#39;s
a very good question but let me put it
this way that when we talk about doing
trials which is really now going on
let&#39;s all think of the Africa and
Hubbell medicine in fact what&#39;s
happening now in Africa in Kenya for
example is not what we are trying to do
is now what we call hub what we call a
policy on Hubble medicine if you look at
the eastern countries we have all
medicine and they and the Western
medicine are running parallel but what
we are doing now with a drug or with
these particular things that we are why
we are close to the California
University on the client trial and so
far what we are getting the clinical
trials are really very very good and in
fact we are going to publish that very
soon and and finally the Iran future
have heard you picture your own future
what&#39;s what&#39;s your dream for you yeah my
dream is very simple my dream I want are
Africa really devoid of diseases healthy
people Africa we can in that&#39;s a lie
and my dream is very simple in 50 years
time I want Africa to catch up with the
development world we cannot wait that
gap is too long but the psychism us
[Applause]
