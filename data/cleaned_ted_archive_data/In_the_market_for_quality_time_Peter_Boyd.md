in this next four minutes over half a
billion real emails will be sent and
received by real people just way too
much email is just one reason why my
mission is to help the world to improve
many lives by helping the world&#39;s
busiest people better manage their time
and their inbox my idea to share today
is to help in demand leaders all the
rising stars trying to get hold of them
and the charities loved by both sides so
with time where with leaders welcome
help many try to force fit their to-do
list on an urgent and important matrix
but our life confused about how to
allocate their time and always feel like
they&#39;re worried they&#39;re working in the
wrong box a more powerful picture of
prioritization is the jar of time filled
with rocks pebbles and sand placed in
the jar in the right order we can fit
everything in reminding us to focus on
the big things in life first drawing two
curves on top of the original matrix and
I think we see the area where we can
help not with the rocks and the top
right leaders spend most of their time
there already and not with the sand in
the bottom left they know what they
don&#39;t value and they don&#39;t waste time on
it they need help with the pebbles in
the middle ground a large part of their
inbox competing for a small part of
their time helping these deserving
inquiries can be useful fun and give
life meaning like mentoring or new
business pitches so the service is just
built how could valuing this middle
ground work consider Christiana Figueres
a wonderful force of nature who led the
world through to the climate talks in
Paris her inbox middle ground is full of
good new ideas from rising stars in her
field like Robbie
unfortunately for Robbie he&#39;s not alone
in just needing a few minutes to discuss
his proposal so now with the new service
in place Christiana can give Robbie and
everyone else with a good idea something
to do so he sent her
private profile and he sees clearly what
she wants to talk about and when she&#39;s
available and he selects to buy raffle
ticket for new ideas on skype with the
ticket proceeds split 70 percent to the
charity of crystianna&#39;s choice and 20
percent to his own pick from a long list
of health education environment and more
if he wins he&#39;s delighted and he
prepares hard boosting the quality of
the meeting for both of them if he loses
well at least he knows where he stands
and he&#39;s avoided no reply limbo so could
this work for a leader in any field
Deborah Kyle Meyer founder and CEO of
travel company Rohr Africa always
prioritizes her clients so she she sends
her private profile to her inbox middle
ground good ideas again coming from
American agencies wanting to work on her
website and African companies want you
to work on her trips so if I&#39;m an
African tour guide I see for $20 fixed
donation I can squeeze onto her calendar
guaranteed and I go for it because I&#39;m
just as passionate about the South
African college of tourism for girls as
she is 90 percent of my money can go to
them after I donate then Deborah sends
me sometimes when she&#39;s more than happy
to chat so she&#39;s very transparent on her
priorities she keeps an eye open for new
opportunities and more girls can
graduate from the college so this
experience has improved many lives the
leader can answer all her emails and
manage and better engage with her inbox
saving her and her team time and helping
her favorite charity the rising stars
all them trying to get hold of her now
know where they stand save their own
time and help their own and help their
own charity and charities are the new
beneficiaries of this exchange raising
money and awareness from a host of
leaders including their own high-profile
supporters so I&#39;ve started working with
some very busy leaders working with some
busy leaders and I finally the projects
in bill irony how difficult it is for
leaders to really take the time to think
about time but the heart is to capture
their attention the bigger the impact I
think
we can have in the long run our time on
this earth is fleeting and enormous ly
precious if you&#39;re busy and in demand
then consider how valuing some of your
time for good could transform many lives
including your own thank you
