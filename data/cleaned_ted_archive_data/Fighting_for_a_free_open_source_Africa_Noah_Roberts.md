technology can be a magic carpet for a
kid for me it was an apple - in second
grade for my second-grade son Jack it&#39;s
Google Earth and that technology that
magic where am i pointing there we go
I lost that magic with technology and
design after 9/11 and it was as if I
just became consumed with this seemingly
intractable issue of mother-to-child HIV
transmission I couldn&#39;t understand how
hundreds of thousands and millions of
kids were we&#39;re dying and you know in
getting this disease and so I want to
say thanks to Bono
thanks to data and thanks to Ted for
making the one campaign because what a
habit what happened is I got my magic
back my partners and I figured out a way
to turn our living into life and we
wanted to go to Rack get our fingernails
dirty and do something my doctor and his
partner came into my office two years
ago with this big idea can we do the
same thing between patients and doctors
and what people do with online banking
online securities why can&#39;t we have a
secure way to interact and as they
describe the solution for a screwed up
US healthcare system they were
essentially describing a solution for
humanity to create medical access where
it&#39;s never existed and I took the single
greatest risk in my career and I said I
would agree to run this venture on one
condition that whatever we use to
produce an America profit we have to
give it away if somebody in Africa wants
it or needs it we have to give it away
and the sixth greatest words in my life
was as far as you can dream and so after
immediately deploying our first pilot in
United States I went straight to the two
people on the planet to know better than
anyone how to prevent HIV transmission
mother to child
Glenda gray and James MacIntyre with a
perinatal HIV research unit in sweat Oh
45 million cell phones in southern
Africa and we already know that the
numbers and statistics on hiv/aids and
TB and malaria but specifically we&#39;re
talking about the seeming
stupid simple technology that allows a
pregnant woman hiv-positive to keep an
appointment whether it&#39;s counseling
maybe it&#39;s understanding why she may
need a c-section why she needs formula
into the breast milk understanding why
and when she needs to take anti
retrovirals so I&#39;m just going to tell
you quickly in the last 12 months
we went to Africa and we asked them what
they needed and we went back to the
states we developed an application we
went back six weeks later we put all of
our code on a 600 dollar server checked
it as luggage on a commercial flight we
flew to the pH ru we installed it we
trained the doctors we trained the staff
and we went home and then we waited I
can cannot count how many people said
that we would not get ethics approval to
do this project and I can tell you two
months ago one of the highest ethics
boards in South Africa deemed that it
was ethical for a patient to have
secured access with a physician via a
mobile phone or through the internet and
so two weeks ago we submitted a formal
request to John Kufuor president of
Ghana
chairman of the African Union to become
an advocate for free and open source
software in Africa and if you want to
speed the size and scale of any
development whether it&#39;s trade or Aid
I&#39;m going to ask you to please get
behind the free and open source software
movement for Africa and I want to thank
our sponsors and I hope this is an idea
worth spreading
