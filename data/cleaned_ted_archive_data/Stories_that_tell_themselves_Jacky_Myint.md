so I&#39;ll tell you all something that I
don&#39;t normally tell people I&#39;ve never
really considered myself a storyteller I
grew up in a small town in southern
Virginia I grew up shy and feeling like
an outsider that town considers itself
the peanut calf a little world but if
you google that there are five other
town to claim that as well so I avoided
the attention it requires to tell
stories to the people around me but the
very thing I didn&#39;t want growing up is
what I wanted the experiences I create I
want the users full attention I want
their focus in time I want them to take
the time to learn something new and have
a moment of wonder so I like to think of
stories as living organisms all jostling
for people&#39;s increasingly divided
tension in time as an interactive
designer it&#39;s my job to help stories
with this challenge as I begin a project
I asked myself how do I help this story
tell itself and each project presents
new question for example this is a
project for a project I worked on for
the council on foreign relations and
media storm the question was how do you
let people explore a story where the
narrative is in the numbers in this case
our answer was an interactive map the
maps communicate set public resistance
to that vaccine efforts is increasing
outbreaks of vaccine-preventable
diseases each circle represents an
outbreak and users can play through the
years to see trends and patterns now the
challenge of attention is different when
you&#39;re working with words I currently
work at the New York Times and our
digital group is always trying to find
ways to push the stories further we want
to make an experience
is not just replicating what&#39;s being
communicated through text in the article
but building upon it we want to make
sure that we&#39;re doing something that can
only be done online and allows for a
deeper sense of engagement so to
accompany an article about vocal
producer we created an experience that
lets the user pick a combination of
audio tracks and compares them to the
vocal producers in doing so they learn
the essentials of what he does which is
to build pop songs from pieces of
different vocal cakes now some stories
require a different approach in long
form that is you want the user to be
immersed in a cohesive way this is a
multimedia feature about elyria ohio a
town that represents anywhere USA it was
important to give a sense of place to
give a sense of what elyria is like so
it opens up with a series of full
browser with ambient videos that show
moments from the town
but this isn&#39;t quite a fully cohesive
experience the multimedia lives
separately from the series of articles
that are relates to and this is what
often happens with multimedia online we
worked hard to address this problem in
snowfall snowfall is a tragic story
about 16 expert skiers and snowboarders
two were caught in an avalanche in
Washington State my colleagues when my
colleagues and I wanted to create a
unique kind of reading experience where
the multimedia and all the different
elements were woven together in a way
that felt natural yet surprising we
chose each element we chose which
elements told the story that&#39;s the right
moments in the text using each kind of
media at what it&#39;s best at
so for example just as you&#39;re reading
about the Cascade Mountains where the
Avalanche takes place you encounter a 3d
flyover graphic that gives you a
physical context of the story
and in in a passage that describes in
detail the skiers and snowboarders have
sent down the mountain a graphic stays
in sync with their scrolling to help you
really visualize the action
and at the bottom of that as you reading
the story where they discover a sphere
at the bottom of the Avalanche you&#39;re
able to see firsthand GoPro footage of
the actual scene so the process that led
to this point involved extensive
iteration as we figured out how to
incorporate all the various elements
into a narrative flow without
distracting from that narrative you
started by mocking up pal the various
elements might fit together breaking out
the usual New York Times site templates
we were thinking of a certain vocabulary
for the different elements from full
browser with graphics to the character
cards on the side and after comping and
wireframing I started coding and initial
prototype we wrestled with how to deeply
integrate the video within the text here
the video interrupts the flow of
narrative just a little too much and we
also struggled with how to get the
transition into and out of the graphics
just right here the transition just
trying to do too many things and the
strips from the narrative with a large
scale project like this is easy to fall
into the trap is trying to include too
much information too many graphics or
visuals just because you have them so it
was really important for us to take the
time to step back and refine and edit
and refine and edit some more so
preparing for this talk has let me step
back and really take a look at the arc
of my work and I realized that you know
I really don&#39;t like being the center of
attention that yes I am a storyteller
and right now they&#39;re really exciting
time to be one the technology that
allows for the availability and creation
of the many stories out there also allow
for the possibilities of new forms of
interactive storytelling there can be
new kinds of experiences across media
across platforms and devices and even in
physical spaces our job is interactive
storytellers is to find the right forms
that best serves the story our job is to
focus on helping each story tell itself
thank you
