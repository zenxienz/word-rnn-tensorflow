hi first of all I must thank the
tedsters and the
organizers make Chris for a wonderful
wonderful conference I can&#39;t remember
the last time I have enjoyed myself so
much almost sinfully so and also I can&#39;t
remember the last time I have been
inspired so much I can&#39;t remember the
last time I have learned so much and
also so a lot of thank you to all the
speakers who who have done such a great
job
all these vignettes that have come in
this last one was just really amazing I
was born in Africa to African parents in
the mid 50&#39;s amongst the flurries of
during the flurries of the
decolonization that would occur and mark
the sixties of Africa I was six when
icons like the Mali mu Julius nere like
dr. kwame nkrumah available a WA Kenneth
Kaunda would come to Addis Ababa to
inaugurate a new age for Africa at this
this cradle for man this cradle for many
of some of the of man&#39;s greatest and
grandest civilizations there was such
palpable hope I was six I didn&#39;t know
what was going on but I knew something
great was happening in Africa
Esteban Becky would say it was a good
day to be an African over subsequent
decades I saw that hope that was so
palpable when I was growing up in
particularly in those early days
battered battered by by genocide
battered by wars battered by the kinds
of things our brother just spoke about
battered by by pandemics by epidemics
battered by all the kinds of things that
have been discussed here and yet a hope
that was so resilient I hope that that
was so powerful that left a kernel of
optimism and that has that has been an
engine in the passion and in the mission
that has been my life&#39;s work which is
really to empower people with
information I have really been very
disinterested in technology per se
I have been most interested in any
vehicle that would inform people that
would deliver information actionable
information that can help people change
their lives that Hope has instructed my
energies it has helped organize a small
team of people of very dedicated people
to actually conceive build launch and
implement a global satellite network
that is today poised to cover something
in the order of five billion people
driving 300 million cars in 131
countries I have been passionate about
empowering people with information this
passion and vision has inspired or this
vision was inspired by a series of
articles that had began to come out
sometime around the late 80s I was
working as a as a lawyer I was part of
the 1% that the 99% have given a bad
name to and but there are series of
articles that were coming out on things
like hiv/aids and one of these articles
was predicting that about 5 million
people would die from hiv/aids in Africa
as a result of the lack of a
communications infrastructure to be able
to deliver information to people so and
then in fact by the end of the decade
through to the article 17 million people
would die from hiv/aids that&#39;s like the
size of a sizable country 17 million
people actually die from hiv/aids in the
last decade of the 20th century it was
at once an aha moment for me it was also
a moment a sad moment in that I I mean
since the mid 70s or so I grew up and we
all grew up in slogans about the power
of information that has been the mantra
of our times but I cannot tell you that
there was no time and even now I cannot
comprehend how information can play such
a toll how so many millions of people
could die from the want of information
from the want of information most most
sadly most like infuriatingly from the
want of information that is so easily
accessible information that you don&#39;t
need it&#39;s not proprietary information
it&#39;s very easy to get this information
and even worse information once you get
it and give it to someone it&#39;s so easy
to understand you don&#39;t need a college
degree to understand that kind of
information so for the want of available
information for the want of easily
understandable information 17 million
people died force for actually I don&#39;t
know how many of the statistics I can&#39;t
give you rattle off statistics about how
many other deaths have occurred in for
similar lack of information in other
areas I&#39;m just talking about hiv/aids
this was 1990 when these predictions
were being made
I had a secure job I had a comfortable
income but I was increasingly
uncomfortable with the callousness of
our times the callousness of our species
that Jane Goodall did such a fantastic
job in explaining I felt you know I just
couldn&#39;t understand how people could die
environments could degrade from lack of
infrastructure that to communicate
readily available information what I
couldn&#39;t even understand furthermore was
how organizations like the World Bank
the IMF is all these moneyed
organizations the African Development
Bank why don&#39;t they all get together and
put such an infrastructure it doesn&#39;t
have to be a complicated infrastructure
it doesn&#39;t have to be broadband it
doesn&#39;t have to be cables and telephony
why don&#39;t we they just put up at least a
simple satellite a simple satellite that
can talk maybe not to a television but
to a radio so that the radio could be
ubiquitous the radio could be you know a
inexpensive to manufacture make it
digital so that maybe the the signal
itself could be could be flexible enough
to allow when moments and require it
multimedia applications but really you
can build such a system and you know I
looked around and this is literally
between 1990 the beginning of 1990 and
mid 1990 and I thought like you know why
don&#39;t
no one is going to do something why
don&#39;t I just start doing something
towards building and launching such a
satellite infrastructure you know I
talked to my wife about it I said I
wanted to quit my job to do this and she
thought I was joking for quite some time
and then when she saw I was serious she
said why don&#39;t you go ahead and do this
and then once you finish your exercise
go back and get yourself a real job and
you know I admit there were challenges
when at the time that we were conceiving
this there were you know you need over a
hundred or so countries to actually
allocate special frequencies to create a
new service of this kind with satellites
that that talked to many countries no
one had built a geostationary satellite
at the time that was able to talk to a
radio no one had and and of course you
know this so I needed technologies and
obviously being a lawyer and still being
a lawyer I had to get this from some
kind of engineers or some kind of
companies so it was really a daunting
task when when you thought about the
whole thing but more importantly you I
also needed a little bit of cash I mean
like hundreds of millions of dollars and
I was short hundreds of millions of
dollars so so to make a long story short
we founded the company in mid-1990 we
got our first license to build launch
and operate a satellite over Africa in
11 months from founding the company we
got 131 countries to allocate
frequencies for the service in 18 months
from founding the company we would in
three years of founding the company we
got all these big companies actually
come together and sort of design an
end-to-end system that would allow a
satellite to talk to a radio in AB sort
of ubiquitous environment and then
finally sometime around 1995 nine or
almost 1996 we raised 1.1 billion
dollars by year 8 we had actually
launched a satellite over Africa and
this would be the first satellite that
was ever launched and still ever
launched dedicated to actually you know
there&#39;s Intelsat and all these other
satellites that sort of make Africa a
part of a much larger coverage area but
a satellite that was dedicated to serve
Africa a satellite a system that was
created to serve Africa and what&#39;s more
is here&#39;s the something that I am happy
about is that this was as Chris
mentioned the first time that actually a
new technology was debuted in Africa
which was before it was handed down to
the United States and other parts of the
world so I just described a very long
period by the 10th year we are by the
8th year we launched our satellite by
the 10th year we launched a second
satellite and between these two
satellites we covered as I mentioned 5
billion people you know Audacity invites
it&#39;s on adversity many of you who have
started startups know the kinds of
issues that come up with with starting a
new a new enterprise of the sort we had
our share of it but most importantly
that is not our story today our story
today really is the fact that the
passion that made this story possible
for me was the hotter which the lack of
information would unleash in Africa this
hotter is sitting in this room today
this hotter is walking and checked
across this beautiful continent today
and that I think is the story what have
we done you might ask what has world
Lisa done in these last few years with
this with this enterprise world space
itself had to be structured by the
commercial enterprise and to pay its
investors for the money that they&#39;ve put
in but we dedicated ample capacity to an
NGO called first voice international to
carry the vision that made this journey
possible so the first voice was created
to provide actionable information to
impoverished to inaccessible populations
it works mostly with indigenous
organizations to deliver critical
information to add using audio and
multimedia services the audio basically
from the satellite directly to a radio
set and then the multimedia so
you connect that radio set on computer
and then it becomes like a modem that
can download data and pretty pretty
respectable speeds first voice itself
today delivers a number of programs I&#39;ll
mention a few we have soap operas in
indigenous languages on reproductive
health on child trafficking and a number
of these kinds of issues these
indigenous soap operas are being
rebroadcast by more than 150 community
radio stations reaching millions of
people today we have many HL programs on
hiv/aids are in many aspects of the
disease from prevention to to the
various things that can be done once
people are once people are known to have
the disease we have agricultural best
practices that are being broadcast to 18
francophone countries in a multimedia
format we have we deliver literally
lectures in slide slides PowerPoint etc
to field agents from the UN that the
government NGOs staff in these countries
we have weather climate and early
warning system that we have created for
rural areas and farmers in nineteen
Western Eastern African countries we
have a food security program in the afar
region where the reson I the other day
told us he found our three million year
old ancestor we we have and there it&#39;s a
multimedia also a program linking 48
communities with the information and
I&#39;ll speak a little bit about that a
little later but that we also have
programs on good governance
teaching rural leaders and officials the
neatest thing about this is almost 90 95
or so percent of the information we are
getting actually we&#39;re not going to
Western capitals we&#39;re getting it right
out of Africa they&#39;re locked this
information is locked in Citadel&#39;s such
as of Learning universities or in
government headquarters not not for any
nefarious reason but no one still has a
way of taking this information and
spreading the ideas
that these information caddy there so
these are some of the ways by which
literally a handful of people at first
voice international with a wide network
of mostly indigenous partners are
actually reaching millions of people to
change their lives in actionable ways
that is I&#39;ll tell you a couple stories
Abdi chef heroin it manages one of first
voices community information center
he gives pastoralists through market
value information for dead animals it&#39;s
a crude version of what the Laney
Governor Martin talked about in with her
community commodity exchange he says to
us that you know to quote farmers don&#39;t
sell that animals are throwaway prices
they are earning up to 30% more income
today then you know there is this these
refugees in the Dadaab refugee camp it&#39;s
one of the largest refugee camps in
Africa it&#39;s in Kenya in north of Kenya
140,000 refugees there are some young
teenagers that were born there that grew
up there you know it completely isolated
disenfranchised they know nothing they
have no hope essentially and we have
with UNHCR we have put receivers in this
camp and and were and were delivering
information on youth leadership and
reproductive health so the young people
have began to come around and more
recently they have formed a club and
they called the dot-com youth club and
one day something absolutely incredible
happened the the people that were
organizing the programs I think
journalists called us Vox Pop the people
that were organizing these programs came
to the camp and interviewed the youth
that were listening this dot-com youth
club about their views on health issues
etc on sex on unli der ship and then the
next day these young people would hear
themselves over a radio that was being
broadcast from Cape Town to Cairo and it
was you know the way it was described to
me was like a goose goose bump phrasing
moment they never dreamed of talking to
an entire continent
they never thought that their views
mattered they learned and they thought
they were empowered and they were
empowering one female refugee that was
actually banned from this youth club by
her father a strict Muslim who didn&#39;t
want us to be sitting down talking about
sex with young people with young men and
so what does she do she goes off and his
sister I&#39;m borrowing the satellite radio
and then she starts her own family a
female dot-com youth club and she called
she says you know gleefully that
information is power of course she is
right information is our when asked what
we could do for him ernest module in his
most moving presentation yesterday said
help us by building capacity by
providing know how by providing
education in 2005 forty five million
children did not see a classroom unesco
says 15 million children 15 I&#39;m sorry 15
million teachers in sub-saharan Africa
require remedial training to qualify for
global standards
so imagine forty five million are out of
school and out of those that have in
school they are being taught by fifteen
million teachers among others I&#39;m sure
that required remedial training to bring
the two to bring their teaching
standards to globe to global standards
so yesterday we saw a great blog about
the children in Africa about how they
add the future of this continent and the
state of Education that is necessary to
make those student does children
powerful is in a grim situation can we
do something about it yes we&#39;re all in
violent agreement given a modicum amount
of information Africans can do a cannon
do solve their own problems Ted has been
a testament to this fact yet look at the
William from Malawi who built a windmill
submitted to meet his family&#39;s need all
he needed was a book to show him how
these anecdotal stories are powerful
they are insightful but here&#39;s what
fires my imagination how do we scale
this impact so that we can have
life-changing books and information that
can reach the Willy
that had a potential across this
beautiful continent I think that that is
the that is the answer that is the
question we need to answer and it can be
done we can put units like the one used
in afar in 1 million schools and
neighborhoods we can deliver
language-specific libraries today we can
put remedial education for teachers we
can stories galore from the likes of
Busey and Chris Abani enough are these
units impact each one of these units
impact about a hundred people a day per
week I&#39;m sorry a hundred people per unit
per week providing area-specific
meaningful information if we scaled up
to a million terminals you can imagine
how how many people we can reach how
many people we can convert to change
jane goodall&#39;s routes to chutes kind of
a program
how many Africans can read us empower to
help themselves how much of that African
ingenuity that mesmerizes us at Ted will
we unleash upon the continent it gets
sweeter how much of these of the
Africans that we heard can actually be
used to to make - to make such a such an
enterprise happen so this is to me the
idea that is worth spreading is creating
an infrastructure that would help us
spread all of the ideas that are worth
spreading no smaller thank you thank you
[Applause]
