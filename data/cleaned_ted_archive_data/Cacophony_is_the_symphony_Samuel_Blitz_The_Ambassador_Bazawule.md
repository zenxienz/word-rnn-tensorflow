have you ever wondered what music would
sound like if you take the bass melody
gave them to the drums I took the drum
melodies and gave them to the horns or
perhaps take the string melodies and
gave them to the guitars now you are
probably imagined in total chaos right
well it&#39;s quite the opposite the sonic
mashup is how I&#39;ve created my sound for
over a decade and I&#39;ve come to the
conclusion that innovative ideas are
best fostered outside of conventional
thinking now I grew up in Ghana in the
capital of a cry and I remember the
magic of music was everywhere funerals
churches wakes you couldn&#39;t escape it
soon I was turning everything around me
into a musical instrument empty gallons
were red with strings to become guitars
empty buckets transformed to drum kits
and plastic pipes became trumpets
because I hadn&#39;t had the chance to study
music formally my personal metronome was
the complex cacophony of sounds in a
crop the chance of hawk is selling in
the streets the offbeat melodies of
fishermen dragon nets and the boom bap
of carpenters crafting furniture this
was my music school this is where I
learned rhythm so I moved to New York
City and put together a live band and I
remember our very first rehearsal the
musicians walked in and asked me the
obvious question where is the sheet
music I thought to myself well damn I
didn&#39;t read music so I didn&#39;t have music
sheets but I&#39;d spent the night before
coming up with these amazing complex
melodies for each instrument but under
so much pressure
I mixed them up I gave the bass melody
to the drums the drums to the guitars
and before I knew it I&#39;d stumbled on
something amazing that was going to
change my life forever there&#39;s a Joseph
PS quote that I absolutely love to live
a creative life we must lose the fear of
being wrong and I knew I wasn&#39;t wrong
because way before music was charted or
studied in schools it was part of our
everyday lives it was free it was
innovative and open to interpretation
the birth of hip-hop culture is the
perfect example of this now can you
imagine a music school trying to teach
the early pioneering DJ&#39;s of the culture
how to scratch I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t have
sheet music for that this is a kind of
innovation that is best fostered outside
of conventional thinking I approached my
filmmaking from the same perspective I&#39;d
done with music taking cues from the
magical realism of my culture soon i was
making images of ancestral spirits
dancing in subway cars and blind
fishermen sailing boats on dry land this
as unconventional as it was became the
foundation of my filmmaking now the
honest truth is this y&#39;all if you love
something and I mean honestly truly love
something i invite you to approach it
from your own unique perspective chances
are you might discover your own magic
thank you
