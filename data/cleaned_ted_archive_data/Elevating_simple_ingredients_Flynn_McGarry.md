so my dad was beep crazy hee hee Joos
them he roasted them he smoked them he
did everything imaginable with beep and
made me try them I knew they were good
for you they&#39;re high in vitamin C
potassium magnesium and phosphates but I
didn&#39;t really like them and I didn&#39;t get
the repeal at this point I had been
cooking for a while at 10 I started
learning techniques and recipes on the
internet and by 12 I let my mom convince
me to have a supper club in our dining
room and a bedroom in my kitchen in my
bedroom so now that I was cooking I
decided to see this unlikeable vegetable
as a challenge so one day I was looking
through a list of ingredients that were
in season and I saw a beets purple
cabbage and cranberries I had no clue if
it was gonna taste even remotely good
together
but I thought that the shades of red and
purple would look really cool together
so my first thought was how can I make
this beet delicious at the time I had
been really into smoking things food
smoking food
and so you take woodchips and you heat
them up until they start smoking and you
put the food in with them until the
smoke permeates and it gives it this
like more savory delicious flavor
that&#39;s why bacon tastes so good so I I
had smoked cucumbers fish potatoes a
bunch of different things but now my
favorite thing to smoke were beets
that&#39;s been smoking when I smoked the
beets that changed the dominant flavor
from sweet to savory it I also
dehydrated them which pulled out some of
the moisture and gave it a denser more
on gist texture the cranberries were
fermented and then cooked down into a
jam and then I cut the beet and got it
mostly everywhere and then punched a
hole in the center and filled it with
the cranberry so it look like a solid
piece of beet and then the red cabbage
was grilled juiced and blended with
creme fraiche and that was the dish
you can hold your applause because this
was to be completely honest it wasn&#39;t
that good but cooking the beat that way
sparked many new ideas so for when I did
the pop-up or the supper club in the
spring I served it with berries and
goat&#39;s milk yogurt that one was a lot
better so I when I create these tasting
menus of 8 to 10 courses for my dinners
only two are usually meat or fish
focused the rest of them are either
vegetarian or using meat and fish to
elevate the flavor of the vegetables I
do this for a couple reasons one I think
it&#39;s a lot harder to cook vegetables and
make them freely delicious I mean who
doesn&#39;t like the smell of frying bacon
if you take like a really humble
vegetable like a beet and make people
freak out about it it&#39;s a lot more
impressive but the more important reason
is for the future of food as everyone
knows meat and fish are becoming less
available and more expensive when I was
11 which was just a few years ago one
pound of ground beef was two dollars and
18 cents a pound and today that same
pound of beef is three dollars and
eighty-eight cents other than the cost
the more pressing matter is the
environmental impact to raise that one
pound of beef takes 13 pounds of grain
and to 2,400 gallons of water now I&#39;m
not convincing anyone to be a vegetarian
just to eat meat and fish in moderation
and if you do that you can learn about
new vegetables like parsnips salsa fie
and sunchokes sunchokes there we go now
back to the beat so very late one night
I was looking through Instagram and I
saw a photo of a beef wellington for
some reason my first thought was what if
I could make that with beets I guess I
just thought it sounded the same and at
this point as you can tell like my dad I
was beat crazy so welcome the next
morning I had to cook it immediately I
smoked the beet confit it peeled it
smoked it again d hi
it covered it in mushroom duxelle which
is a paste made from mushrooms white
wine garlic and onions wrapped it in
beet greens and then in puff pastry and
baked it like you would a Wellington I
served it with creamed sorrel smoked and
glazed date and a beef Bordelaise
opposed to a beef Bordelaise which is
made from charred beets charred onions
smoked beet juice smoked butter and
finished with a beet vinegar I really
like this dish but I thought that I
could improve it even more so like you
would a really nice steak I decided to
dry aged it so it pulls out some of the
moisture and makes the flavor even more
intense so I hung a beet from a string
for three weeks until it shriveled up
and looked pretty much inedible
then I seared it on both sides and
roasted with brown butter garlic in time
like I would a steak and I served it
with the same beef Bordelaise creamed
beet greens and fried shallots the
[Music]
weirdest thing about this dish was it
made my mouth water which is definitely
not something usually associated with
vegetables and now that I have this kind
of mindset of cooking beets like I would
a steak or any other kind of meat I can
use it for other vegetables and
vegetables have a really incredible
natural flavor that will only come out
if they&#39;re cooked properly
if you just steam them or boil them and
just like leave them on until they&#39;re
mush it&#39;s not gonna taste good no one&#39;s
gonna want to eat that so when people
are wanting meat at home instead of
eating that entirely and creating more
demand for it and making it more
endangered to maybe cook a piece of
broccoli or something but cook it like
you would the steak and make it even
more delicious and it&#39;ll help people eat
healthier cut down the demand and
ultimately improve our planet so in
conclusion eat your beets
[Applause]
