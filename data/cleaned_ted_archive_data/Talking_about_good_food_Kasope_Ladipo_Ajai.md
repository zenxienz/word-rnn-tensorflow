hello everybody I&#39;m here to tell you
about good food and I don&#39;t really think
that that would be too difficult because
we all appreciate our food in Nigeria so
Niger is usually known for 409 Boko
Haram the third world oil but nobody
ever really talks about our foods and
it&#39;s funny because our food is a big
part of our culture
in fact the yardstick for stocks of any
Nigerian party is the amount and the
quality of food that you serve at it
you&#39;re all laughing because you know
that we have a rich heritage of food and
we&#39;re very loud about telling everybody
about it I mean our Ghanaian brothers
experience is very recently with the
jollof Wars we don&#39;t joke with our food
and you know so if we don&#39;t eat all
these foods everyday we usually eat
ammonia parties we have over 300 ethnic
groups in Nigeria and each of them has
their own special dish why don&#39;t we eat
them all the time because they&#39;re so
difficult to make they take too much
time and not brings to mind the question
why can&#39;t we cook Nigerian food without
so much stress ikurou no convenience
brand and we&#39;re focused on the
processing and packaging of suits our
spices are entran products the pepper
mix is a blend of tomatoes onions and
pepper now that&#39;s the major ingredient
in many Nigerian meals why did we start
from that because of three major
problems the first one is that the time
and the effort it takes cooking IGM meal
is too much most of our food is cooked
from scratch every single day and any
nigerian who cooked to tell you that the
value of prepping beforehand I mean you
can&#39;t take away from it now I travel on
holiday and I like to cook Nigerian food
so I go into African stores and I
realized that the Nigerian ingredients
in the African stores do not come from
Nigeria most of them they come from
small African countries and you&#39;re
wondering why because my channels make
up a large percentage of African
diaspora what are we doing wrong
what are we not doing correctly we need
to start packaging properly we need to
start showing before our food the right
way we need to stop cutting corners and
putting substandard products out there
now we love to cook meaning that we have
to go to the market right but most of
our markets are really dirty and so the
process of making most of our foods or
the you know the preparation it&#39;s not
really in a hygienic way these are the
three main problems that were facing for
in Nigerian food generally now what
trying to change the culture our culture
is that we go to the market we buy the
ingredients and you know we make them
from scratch now we&#39;re trying to shift
to a new way but wherever traditional
people and changing tradition is very
very hard but if we want to actually
share our food with other Africans and
the rest of the world we need to put it
in a formula we understand we need to
make it easy for everybody
and so we&#39;re starting from the basics
and we evolved as we go this is the
future of Nigerian cooking can you
imagine that Chris is here in Nigeria
this is this delicious bowl of vegetable
soup and it can read a recipe go into
any neighborhood store everything is low
in Nigeria I can go in an African store
and pick up the ingredients already
prepared is it to cook and I can&#39;t
successfully make it for you
Nigerian vegetable soup that is the
future that we&#39;re dreaming of until we
can do that that is when my dream can
become like Chinese in our one beers
that is where we want to take Nigerian
food - the possibilities are endless the
future is so pregnant with many of them
I&#39;m so happy can you imagine if you&#39;re
walking through a your Paris turns and
you ask for Continental and yourself
Gary and granite on the rocks I mean
it&#39;s funny right it sounds like fantasy
but it can become a reality if we start
encouraging young Nigerians to go beyond
the boundaries I remember very vividly
my grandmom grinding pepper with the
stone for soup
I&#39;m really young it&#39;s just a few years
ago and today we&#39;re talking about pepper
mix in a bag in a store it means that
there&#39;s so much we can do we want to
have a world where Pam wine becomes
Solano&#39;s Nigeria they will choose to the
English we want to have go to Nigeria as
tacos is to Mexico we want to have Gery
Angra not to Nigeria as crackers and
covere is to the Russians I believe so
much in my country education has opened
my mind has broadened my horizon and
every day I look for ways to share my
tradition with the world I&#39;m a computer
engineer who is so passionate about my
roots and today I am a know mulatto
thank you very much
