one afternoon in late 2013 a San Diego
high school sophomore named olive opened
up her Twitter account and noticed
something really strange was happening
30 scantily clad women had followed her
all at once guys WTF 30 porn stars just
followed me what&#39;s happening
but it didn&#39;t stop with those 30 the
poorni followers kept pouring in
hundreds and then thousands am i paying
for this she tweeted each follower had a
strangely approachable by oh there was
Chantelle Rodham a casual beer fan from
Butte Montana
and of course there was a coffee
advocate hipster friendly analyst and a
hardcore social media scholar bacon
ninja but the bacon ninja was not a real
person
none of them were they were BOTS little
pieces of code running on the internet
using made stolen pictures and
computer-generated bios these particular
BOTS were working on behalf of a pretty
shady casting call service website and
normally BOTS like this are programmed
to follow celebrities where they can
hide out in among the millions of people
who follow famous people but something
clearly had gone awry in the code and
they were all following olives now even
though the followers weren&#39;t real their
effect on olives life was after a couple
of days she had 5,000 followers up from
just 600 and in high school these days
apparently the number of followers you
have matters she was becoming a legend
one boy tweeted to no one in particular
that olive was officially famous as
this is a thing about artificial
intelligence in 2015 on the one hand
these bots are not sophisticated at all
they&#39;re not the artificial intelligence
of 2001 a Space Odyssey or Skynet or
even Siri but what they show is that
computers don&#39;t need to be as smart as
us to do some humanish things and to
have very real effects on our lives so
I&#39;ve been watching this for the past
couple years it&#39;s phenomenon I want to
share with you some bots that do some
human things at pentameter on writes
poetry
it&#39;s bio reads with algorithms subtle
and discrete I seek I am back writings
to retweet and indeed it searches
Twitter looking for lines of text in
Shakespeare&#39;s preferred meter and
retweeting couplet of them to great
effect now we&#39;re in dust the breathless
hero lay Sprint service is upsetting me
today I can only see the dress in gold
and white I really love the Internet
tonight I really have the worst
attention span the journey is the
destination man at low poly bot makes
art so it&#39;s it&#39;s on Twitter waiting for
someone to send it to picture to play
with so you might fitted something like
this and then it chooses some filters
and algorithms to use on that image and
it would send you back this a custom
miniature artwork I detect a few notes
of Chagall here myself a traverse OCR
reads the artist areas Kazemi
wanted to create a bot that showed the
limits in the logic of OCR that&#39;s
optical character recognition or the
technology that turns you know like a
picture of text into an editable Word
document so he wrote a piece of software
that just kind of randomly doodles in a
white box and then he asked the OCR
software to try and read those doodles
and turn them into English words the end
result is this these words that the bot
can read and maybe we can
like I almost see Google there perhaps
at Olivia taters is a teenager she was
created by The Colbert Report Writer Rob
Devin and she works like this she looks
for adverbs like literally and then she
recombines the phrases around them into
literally the most realistic teenager
tweets on the Internet
I feel like maybe police departments are
amazingly out of order you are actually
unique just like everyone else but not
all bots are so cute and charming the
random darknet shopper commits crimes to
london-based artist program this bot to
sweep out over the darknet looking for
things to buy with $100 of the
cryptocurrency Bitcoin so we bought some
counterfeit shoes at bought some pants
but 200 cigarettes and then about 10
ecstasy pills who is responsible for
committing this crime and buying these
illegal drugs is it the Swiss artists is
it the bot itself somehow is it the
gallery that sponsored their show no one
is really quite sure at every three
minutes
teachers history Kayla McDaniel is a
historian at Rice and he wanted his
students to really understand to feel
the relentless mechanisms of slavery
another historian had calculated that in
the antebellum American South a slave
was traded every 3.6 minutes and that
was significant because what it meant
was that slavery didn&#39;t just exist it
had to be constantly reproduced so we
wrote a bot that tweets every three
minutes that a slave was sold sometimes
including links to research or to actual
images of bills of sale like this one
for a 13 year old girl named Janie no I
followed this bot because I want to feel
the weight of history pressing down on
the present all the time not just when
I&#39;m reading a David McCullough book
and sometimes when my little baby boy
wakes me up in the middle of the night
and again go and I checked Twitter and
with my American friends mostly silent
what I see is slave sale after slave
sale after slave sale if the bot never
stops the bot never sleeps and that is
exactly at a point most spots right now
only simulate a single human ability and
a warping it in the process of
translation from person to machine but I
think those distortions can be
clarifying like a caricature that lets
you see your features outside of
yourself our bots are social urges
materialized into code and my hope is
that when we can see what we&#39;re doing
detach from who we think we are will
better understand the kind of society we
want to have as for all of the San Diego
teenager her robotic Fame and it quickly
put her banned all the spam bots and she
tweeted I&#39;d rather have a couple of real
followers who love me than thousands of
fake ones but her life ever really went
back to normal she gained hundreds of
followers and she actually uses the
experience that she went through in
essays that she writes and its features
before the student body the bots changed
who she was and we want to change you
just a little bit with a bot that we
made for this session here at Ted all
you have to do is follow at truth dare
bot and tweet truth or dare at it we
worked with we worked with Ian bogus
Georgia Tech professor and writer and
provocateur thank you
