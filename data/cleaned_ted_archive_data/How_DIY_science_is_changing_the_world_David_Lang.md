last year one of my heroes passed away
John Dobson
wach astronomer was 98 years old he&#39;ll
be best remembered for his namesake
design which was a called the Dobsonian
telescope and it&#39;s a unique novel way of
mounting larger lenses using whatever
materials happen to be lying around
Dobson was not an engineer he was not
even a classically trained astronomer in
fact he began his young career as a monk
and when his telescope building hobby
became too much of a distraction the
monastery forced him to choose between
the two lucky for all of us
he chose telescopes he never patented
his design never tried to make money off
of it but he dedicated himself to
teaching everyone and anyone the methods
and the joy of building their own spent
the rest of his life standing on street
corners traveling around the world and
inviting everyone he met to look up into
the Stars more than just an inventor
Dobson was a pioneer in the realm of
amateur science his formula low-cost DIY
tools in a community and culture of
collaboration has been one of the major
reasons that amateurs have been able to
make so many important contributions to
the field it&#39;s not a simple it&#39;s not a
difficult formula it&#39;s very simple but
it&#39;s been very hard for other scientific
disciplines to replicate until very
recently over the past few years across
the board the tools for doing science
and exploration and conservation have
become more accessible and more powerful
a local community in Borneo builds DIY
drones to monitor and protect the
rainforests a new origami microscope
that cost less than the cost of postage
gives rise to a community of tens of
thousands of people who are
experimenting and exploring the micro
cosmos after the nuclear reactor in
Fukushima Japan a group of makers and
hackers get together to create safecast
they build their own Geiger counters and
map the impacts in real-time
DIY biologists are now competing in
international design competitions with
their engineered microbes all the while
building new low-cost tools to power the
growing number of garage wet labs the
list of examples goes on and
the walls between questions and answers
are being torn down by groups with these
open source tools we don&#39;t have a good
name for this trend yet but it&#39;s coming
on fast I think calling it science might
be too high of a bar but just in the
same way you wouldn&#39;t call all of the
cat videos on YouTube films it should be
careful because some people probably
might you can&#39;t ignore the phenomenon
what the internet did to movies and
music and journalism and manufacturing
it&#39;s now turning onto the process of
discovery the combination of cheap
sensors open standards and most
importantly connected enthusiasm is
unleashing the long tail of curiosity
it&#39;s a new era of connected exploration
and if you thought that smart
thermostats were cool then you&#39;re gonna
love this because this isn&#39;t about
efficiency and convenience this is about
wonder and this is about adventure I&#39;ve
experienced this flood of amateur
enthusiasm and interest firsthand a few
years ago my friend Eric and I built an
underwater robot in his garage in
Cupertino we shared the design online
and found thousands of others other
people who shared our passion for
low-cost ocean exploration six months
ago we launched a site called open
Explorer a digital field journal
designed to give our community a way to
share not just what we were building
together but what we were exploring in
that short time we&#39;ve seen everything
from the discovery of shipwrecks in
Australia the pursuit of lost Incan
cities in Peru it&#39;s gone far beyond the
underwater realm as well there&#39;s a field
biologist in Mojave who&#39;s building
internet-connected Rovers to monitor and
protect the endangered desert tortoise
her makers and scientists are going into
the jungles of Madagascar with soldering
irons and microcontrollers to push the
limits of remote sensing for research
and conservation we&#39;re watching these
weird and wild and interesting stories
unfold right before our eyes the rules
for these new methods are being written
right now one thing so far is already
clear when you give people the tools to
ask questions they will surprise you
with what they ask and with what they
discover thank you
