my dad took this picture back in
nineteen
five of me and my mom when I was six
years old during my family&#39;s three and a
half year round-the-world sailing trip
and more than 30 years later I took this
picture of my wife and son during my
third time around the world and I&#39;ll
tell you after all those years at sea
and hundreds of hours spent underwater
the ocean really is in trouble and I got
this sense from subtle things like it&#39;s
not just less fish but they actually
behave differently when you see them
underwater and the trade winds don&#39;t
blow like they used to in places where
the ocean used to bless us with big
gentle swells it&#39;s now confused and
feels anxious and out there in the
middle of thousand miles from land it
even smells different than it used to
and of course science is telling us the
same thing acidification of the ocean is
putting the entire marine ecosystem at
risk yet more than half the oxygen on
the planet comes from phytoplankton in
the sea fish provide the greatest
percentage of protein to humans yet 85%
of Fisheries are at or beyond their
biological limits and today less than
three percent of the ocean is protected
the vast majority of us live near the
coasts and three-quarters of our
megacities are on the coast themselves
yet trillions of dollars of
infrastructure at risk if the sea-level
rise is just one meter as someone who
loves the ocean I&#39;m actually worried
about one thing the most even though
most of us may live near the sea
precious few of us actually share a deep
connection with it and without that
connection change just isn&#39;t going to
happen so how do we change that how do
we make that connection I&#39;ll tell you
the ocean needs more storytellers
storytellers like Jacques Cousteau and
Steve Zissou and the great sailor and
author Bernard what they see a and of
course Sylvia Earle but we need
thousands of people like that to spread
the message further to connect with more
people and that&#39;s why for the past year
at Autodesk we&#39;ve been repurposing some
of our most advanced technology to help
everyone tell that ocean stories
this is slighly he&#39;s the founder of the
hydrous he&#39;s an ocean scientist who&#39;s
made it his mission to communicate about
the ocean and make as many of you the
ocean storytellers as he can and he&#39;s
doing that with a technology called
reality capture that he&#39;s using to share
what he sees underwater with as many
people as possible and trying to make
them the oceans storytellers let me show
you how it works basically you take a
series of photographs of the object that
you want to capture with an ordinary
camera even a smartphone will work and
then with a piece of technology called
Autodesk memento those photos are
uploaded to the cloud and then hundreds
of CPUs work on figuring out where each
of those photos was taken in space they
correct for lens distortions differences
in cameras to produce this a very
high-resolution 3d model from simple
photographs in fact these models are so
good that we can see individual coral
polyps in the 3d data now certainly this
is a lot more compelling than a still 2d
photo but what&#39;s really cool is because
it&#39;s 3d data it&#39;s something that a
computer understands too it&#39;s computable
data and that means a couple of
different things for one I can take the
file from the table coral that you saw a
minute ago and send it directly from
memento to a 3d printer and get
something like this
now imagine the power of putting this in
the hands of schoolchildren who have
never been to the sea and wouldn&#39;t it be
cool if one of those kids became an
ocean scientist or a government leader
working for change but first that kid
has to fall in love with the ocean and
maybe this experience of holding this in
their hand could be the spark to set
that off there&#39;s something else that&#39;s
cool about having this 3d data
scientists used to study coral like this
with a tape measure and I&#39;m serious it&#39;s
like dr. Seuss like one coral to coral
three coral right now with reality
capture because this is computable data
the computer can actually tell me yes
there was a coral there but it can tell
me exactly where it was it can tell me
its precise dimensions down to a couple
hundred microns
if I go back six months later and
photograph that same coral again the
computer can actually tell me is it
doing well or is that coral in trouble
and if we capture repeatedly we can
actually observe ecological change take
place over time now because these tools
are accessible to anybody with a camera
and an internet connection suddenly you
have a hundred times or a thousand times
the number of minds thinking about this
stuff going out collecting data and
sharing it okay so what well all of
those people are now the oceans
storytellers okay there&#39;s another
problem people don&#39;t care this is my
friend Bill and he doesn&#39;t give a
about the ocean not no not not because
he&#39;s a bad guy he&#39;s actually a really
nice guy but he&#39;s not thinking about
this stuff he&#39;s not aware and he&#39;s not
engaged why because it&#39;s hard to relate
in fact for many the ocean is just this
vast featureless plain but people do
care about other people so why not
engage with people connect them to the
ocean through stories of our rich
seafaring history this is dr. Brendan
Foley of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution and he is currently leading
the research on the wreck of the
Antikythera it&#39;s arguably the most
significant underwater archeological
site of our time it is a two
thousand-year-old Roman ship that&#39;s
loaded with ancient Greek treasures and
it&#39;s not just any two thousand year old
trip it&#39;s like an 18-wheeler backed up
to a luxury mall and they filled it up
with really fancy stuff and then it got
lost at sea it&#39;s actually where the
Antikythera mechanism was found this is
an ancient computer that we think was
designed by Archimedes and last time
that Brennan and his team were diving on
the wreck they found this beautiful
bronze worn emit from a luxurious bed
kind of like a bedpost and as they were
clearing the sand away from this thing
they knew that they&#39;d found something
very special so they did a reality
capture of it to get a record of it in
situ and then as the diver is coming up
through the water column towards the
surface very carefully cradling this
2,000 year old object it disintegrates
turns to dust it&#39;s gone it&#39;s lost
forever except it&#39;s not lost because
they captured reality I can stand here
holding it in my hand today in bronze
from a 3d print of that data and I&#39;ll
tell you it feels pretty cool here
standing here holding this it&#39;s intense
remember earlier I said that it&#39;s hard
to relate and that actually applies to
me too I&#39;ll share a personal story with
you I&#39;ve been thinking about sea-level
rise for quite some time and certainly
from an intellectual standpoint I
understand what sea-level rise is but
from an emotional standpoint I&#39;ve had a
really hard time understanding what it
means this is the road that we take to
drive the kids to school every day and
it happens to be in an area that&#39;s
particularly susceptible to sea-level
rise so we chose it for an experiment we
gathered the best scientific data
available we ran simulations with some
advanced software and did some
interactive visualization to create this
this is what that exact spot will look
like when the sea level rises 3 feet and
I&#39;ll tell you the first time I saw this
was the first time that I actually
understood what sea level rise meant for
me when I saw it I literally went oh
 and that&#39;s exactly the kind of
emotional connection I&#39;m talking about
making now I&#39;m super excited about this
technology these tools and technology in
general to help solve some of the oceans
problems but we still need the people
that are going to take those tools into
their hands and create the stories
create the engaging experiences and
narratives the problem is we&#39;re still
desperately short of storytellers I have
some bad news for you two of these guys
are dead one of them doesn&#39;t actually
exist and Sylvia bless her has done more
than her fair share and she could really
use a hand
[Applause]
but the good news is it&#39;s actually not
too late if we get our together we
might actually change things and things
could happen very quickly within a
generation for some of the issues that
the ocean faces so here&#39;s my challenge
to you go out and make a connection with
the ocean yourself yes of course but use
your voice your creativity your
influence maybe some of these tools to
engage with your kids your schools your
community your industry maybe a whole
country and connect them to the ocean
tell them a story and help them fall in
love because in the end I think we might
actually do what it&#39;s going to take to
save something that we care so deeply
about
[Applause]
