my company manages dead people
but not just
dead people but rather I
muqdad people as we call them deal em
too short for dead sea loves d loves is
big business in the past few years
big-time investors have bought the
estates of Elvis Marilyn Monroe and even
Bob Marley Forbes magazine publishes a
list every year of the top earning dead
celebrities last year the top 15 made
366 million dollars and the King of Pop
Michael Jackson he topped that list he
had a busy year he brought home a
hundred and seventy million dollars and
it&#39;s just the beginning for Michael
because his Cirque de Soleil tour aptly
named the immortal show is out touring
the US now and it will probably be his
biggest tour ever it&#39;s hard to become an
icon most celebrities even a listers
stayed away like the celluloid that made
them famous but the few who make it to
the posthumous a list are perpetuated in
advertising campaigns circuses even
bobblehead dolls and coffee mugs in life
d loves were big-time celebrities
whereas in death they&#39;re transformed
into big global brands and each lives on
settling in our popular consciousness to
evoke some larger than life ideal or
positive association smart cool just
creative sexy you own those words and
you own eternal opportunity advertisers
and marketers return to these faces
again and again as a means of
associating with something instantly
recognizable comfortable evocative and
stable these faces like great brands do
not lie they stand for something big and
they&#39;re true to it and their star will
only rise over time because unlike their
life counterparts the paparazzi can&#39;t
expose them or follow them and they
won&#39;t make the errors in judgment that
we sometimes make they can jeopardize
their legacy we all share the same faith
we will all die just like they did
history will forget almost all of us
maybe one or two of us has a shot at the
Forbes lift but it&#39;s an ironic reward
that list if you make it you have no
idea that you did and you&#39;ll never get
to spend any of the money anyway stand
for something big and be true to it
that&#39;s the reward that we get from this
life and it&#39;s ultimately what these
faces tell us it&#39;s the surest way by
standing firm to live forever thank you
you
