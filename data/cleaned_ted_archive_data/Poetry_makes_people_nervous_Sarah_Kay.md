poetry makes people nervous that&#39;s what
I&#39;ve learned
everywhere I go people have a lot of
questions like how long should it take
to write a poem or what happens if you
get writer&#39;s block so I tend to tell
people that poetry is like pooping if
there&#39;s a poem inside you it has to come
out and sometimes it can be really
difficult and take much longer than
you&#39;d like it to it might even be
painful and other times it can be really
easy and happen much faster than you
expected it but either way it is
important and you feel so much better
when it&#39;s done this explanation for
trees are real hit with middle school
boys I can tell you that and yes it is
certainly silly and perhaps even a
little bit vulgar and although I usually
mean it in mild jest it&#39;s also pretty
helpful for me whenever I travel to
schools and colleges to perform and
teach spoken word poetry I always meet
people who say oh I don&#39;t like poetry or
I don&#39;t get poetry or poetry&#39;s just not
for me
they&#39;ve been led to believe that poetry
can only be written by certain types of
people for certain types of people about
very specific subjects part of what I
try to do in schools is take poetry off
of a pedestal and make it a little bit
more approachable and accessible there&#39;s
nothing more Universal than some good
scatological humor but what I&#39;m really
trying to do is reshape the frame in
which we think about poetry so that it&#39;s
less distant and secret and more human
because I think it makes it easier for
us to feel like poetry belongs to us is
for us is from us and even if it means
having to be a little silly or cheeky I
think it&#39;s worth it because I want to
welcome people into poetry especially
people who have previously felt
unwelcome I want to celebrate anybody
who
is trying to make sense of the world
through poetry the way I try to make
sense of it in 2011 when my TED talk
went online something amazing happened
through the incredible influence of Ted
and the widespread reaches of the
internet people all around the world saw
that talk and reached out to me with
excitement and curiosity about spoken
word poetry and it is without an ounce
of exaggeration that I say my whole
world changed probably the most
substantial evidence is the way that
I&#39;ve been able to share poetry farther
and farther away from home since giving
that talk I&#39;ve been invited to teach and
perform in India Singapore Australia
Ghana Mexico the United Arab Emirates
the British Virgin Islands France Sweden
many more
not to mention all across the United
States I mainly live out of a suitcase
and I am in a chronic state of jetlag
I&#39;m also really lucky and I am just one
poet and teacher I certainly did not
intend on becoming a spokesperson for
spoken word poetry but isn&#39;t an it is an
honor when I am treated as such and when
I am invited abroad to share and teach
poetry I take my job seriously in
December of 2012 I was the recipient of
a u.s. Department of State Award through
the American Embassy in Nepal which
allowed me to teach a multifaceted
spoken word poetry education platform to
over nine schools and Katmandu and one
morning I was making myself breakfast in
the kitchen of my hotel room when I
looked down to see my face on the front
page of a newspaper now I don&#39;t know if
you&#39;ve ever seen your face on the front
page of a newspaper although I guess in
this room it&#39;s probably more likely but
usual but it had certainly never
happened to me before and it&#39;s very
alarming and so I started to investigate
because I couldn&#39;t figure out how this
had happened and then I slowly recalled
that a few days previous there had been
a young woman who had stayed after my
show to ask me some questions but
because she was so young I had just
assumed that she was asking me questions
for her school newspaper not the largest
english-speaking newspaper in Katmandu
but that must have been it because there
was this big photo of me
and this glowing review underneath and I
was so thrilled I couldn&#39;t wait to call
home and tell everyone about it and when
I got to the bottom of the article it
said turn to page seven for exclusive
interview
I turned to page seven and I saw that
they had titled the article for the love
of words and I was beaming with pride
and you know how in newspapers
underneath the headline they&#39;ll always
give you one line that is to make you
want to read the rest of the article so
right underneath for the love of words
it said poetry is like pooping if
there&#39;s a poem inside you it has to come
out
Sarah Kay so I called home and said well
good news bad news and mom said oh no
you in that potty mouth but there is a
phenomenal poet and a dear mentor of
mine and fellow potty-mouth by the name
of Kristen O&#39;Keefe optics and she has
this beautiful poem about women writers
that I think about all the time and the
very last line of her poem she says I
say into the phone mom it&#39;s hard
sometimes to know if you&#39;re making any
difference at all and mom says baby
don&#39;t you know how lucky you are they
used to burn women like you bust down
any door you have to and bring in
everyone you can right after you got a
voice right well then use it I Sarah Kay
know how lucky I am to have this voice
and people who will listen to it I know
how lucky I am that so many people have
busted down so many doors so that I
could be here and even though this
moment this precise talk might not be
exactly what those people were
envisioning I promise I will continue
holding open doors and welcoming in
everyone I can
Thanks
you
