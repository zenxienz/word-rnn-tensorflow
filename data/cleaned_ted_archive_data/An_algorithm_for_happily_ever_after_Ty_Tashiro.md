I hope you felt the heart pounding
butterflies in the stomach head spinning
experience of falling in love it&#39;s
really one of the best experiences that
we have in this life and sometimes it&#39;s
so good the people hope that that
happiness lasts for a lifetime for
finding a love story that ends happily
ever after these days seems harder than
ever and that&#39;s partly because societal
beliefs give us the wrong instructions
about how to find it the first love
stories we hear as children are fairy
tales that tell us that love appears
magically and adolescence we read
romantic tragedies that tell us that
love appears by faith now these might
sound like fanciful fictions of our
youth but researchers find that these
beliefs that love is both delivered and
ensured by faith continue well into
adulthood
now that might sound unlikely but I&#39;m
sure all of you can think of friends who
are intelligent grown adults who seem to
lose all capacity for reason when it
comes to their love life and so it can
happen to the best of us it leaves us
with a conundrum on the one hand falling
in love is one of the best experiences
that we can have emotionally on the
other hand it seems to compromise our
ability to make well-reasoned decisions
and we need to make good decisions
because our romantic relationships are
strongly related to our psychological
well-being life satisfaction and even
our physical health and so we need
something more reliable than the
material whims of faith to find our
happily ever after I spent about two
years thinking about how to approach
this conundrum while writing a book
called the science of happily ever after
and I found that happily married couples
do all kinds of things differently in
the relationships that are helpful but
the most interesting thing to me was
something they did before they ever said
I do and that was they chose partners
with a certain set of traits and
characteristics that set them up for
success
now think for a second about the traits
of your ideal partner you might want
one who&#39;s has certain personality traits
or physical characteristics there&#39;s
actually hundreds of things that you
could wish for and the good news I have
for you is there&#39;s pretty good odds you
can get your first three wishes
fulfilled so you want to use those
wishes wisely now science can help us in
this regard because it can tell us the
relative value of certain traits
compared to others when it comes to
long-term satisfaction and civility from
longitudinal studies now the things like
kindness are obviously more valuable
than things like physical attacks
meanness or wealth right that sounds
like common sense but when you watch
what couples actually do when selecting
a partner they choose on looks and money
as to live for three wishes now there&#39;s
a really low return on investment if you
want to think about that way now what
about these other three dots I just
there&#39;s hundreds of personnel I trade
sites those three there are pre powerful
predictors kind partners are awesome
they&#39;re generous they&#39;re empathic they
want to be supportive of you emotionally
stable partners are not Psychopaths
they&#39;re less prone to anger and they&#39;re
just pleasant to be around sensation
seekers they need novelty and they love
to take risks to generate exciting
experiences and they&#39;re really fun to
date for a while and then it&#39;s really
incompatible is the idea of being
married to the same person for decades
on end so what would happen if someone
wished well and whispered these three
traits instead of looks money or
something else that doesn&#39;t predict well
well before we do that let&#39;s take a look
at what happens to the average couple
over the course of the first thirteen
years of marriage okay and that&#39;s
represented by the blue dot the green
dot are people who choose poorly they
actually make bad decisions about
choosing a partner and what you can see
is this is that their sharp declines my
thought experiment if couples had a
million dollars of relationship
satisfaction in year one average couples
would lose half a million dollars by
year thirteen and poor choice couples we
lose over $800,000
by year thirteen now before we look at
this last graph let me tell you that we
can&#39;t always have our hearts pounding
that&#39;s high blood pressure butterflies
in the stomach is comes with stress
hormones that are toxic when they&#39;re
chronically released so you&#39;re going to
come down a little bit and that&#39;s okay
but you got to live your life too and
have your faculties about you so let&#39;s
look at what happens when people
actually wish well and there&#39;s many
other traits besides personality that
are strong predictors but what you can
see is that they whether the early
challenges of marriage play well and
accept themselves up for a long and
happy marriage I don&#39;t think people
should just coldly choose their partners
based on some algorithm but also think
relationships can be complicated and
hard and so if science can help us a bit
in this regard to find our happily ever
after I think it&#39;s well worth our while
thank you
