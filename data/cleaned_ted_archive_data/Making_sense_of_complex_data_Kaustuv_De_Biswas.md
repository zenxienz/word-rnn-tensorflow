the dead fellows are working on some of
the most pressing challenges of our
times
climate change regional conflicts
fighting inequalities to tackle these
issues
it requires collaboration across
disciplines which are often hard to
understand and hard to identify last
month we asked all the Ted fellows about
themselves their work their
collaborations their needs their
motivations and the data in RAW format
is really hard to understand we use
shapes to make sense of it for example
here is a shape which answers questions
about proportions the different
countries in the where the fellows are
coming from here&#39;s the shape which
answers questions about the age
distributions the average age is 36 by
the way and the youngest being 19
however the point is every shape that we
used to explore the data is in effect a
lens through which we gain understanding
I&#39;ve been an architect for the first
half of my career and I&#39;ve played with
shapes using simple pen and paper then I
studied computer science at MIT to build
digital tools to design with complex
shapes the one thing that I discovered
and that I hope to convince you here
today that shapes are an interface for
thinking they affect and influence the
very questions that we ask for example
here&#39;s a shape that answers questions
about the geographic reach of the
fellows program every dot here is
actually a fellow and if we overlay the
connections between who collaborates
with who we get we get to see how
incredibly and truly international disco
these collaborations are however it&#39;s
hard to understand if there are any
distinct collaborative groups working
together in this particular shape in
this particular view every dot is still
a fellow and fellows working together
find each other in space literally and
form these constellations these
constellations are like the new
continents they defy the geography
boundaries these shapes also help us see
some hidden patterns which are normally
invisible for example here&#39;s a group of
fellows collaborating with each other in
the in film photography and writing
they include stock space researchers -
data storytellers - film makers
here&#39;s another constellation where
fellows are working on agriculture
ecology and sustainable design the
largest constellation is around
technology entrepreneurship and data
science this is also the constellation
where I find myself through the TED
Fellows program I met ecologist Eric
Birla and data artist David Gorman and
together we&#39;ve been building a
technology platform to make sense of
complex data actually what you see on
the screen is a live demonstration of
that very platform the Nexus of science
design and technology and action using
mapper we have been collaborating with a
set of fellows and on we explored from
music to microbes previously Eric and
David had worked with data artist Julie
Freeman on a project to democratize
personal data called we the data we the
data was actually presented at the World
Economic Forum Judy is at the heart of
this emergent group of fellows working
at the intersection of art and activism
with Jana Tavernier a social activist
Julie is building a platform to bring
art and activism closer called fine acts
fine acts is a platform which recently
brought together around 25 TED Fellows
to explore the meaning of peace to their
work moving from art to art history
this is Genevieve vaunted singer an art
historian who is working with underwater
robotics entrepreneur called David lang
David so this is the shape of the
synergistic the the synergistic
collaborations within the fellows
program now what about potential
collaborations but then collaborations
waiting to happen what if we could
expose and find the hidden links between
people who are who share similar
interests and motivations here&#39;s what it
would look like the every dot here is
still a fellow but they&#39;re not linked
with who collaborates with who but if
they share similar interests and
motivations let&#39;s recap here every dot
is a fellow and they&#39;re linked if they
share explicit collaborations here they
are linked if they share similar
motivations and interests let&#39;s zoom
back to David lang David here is instead
of being linked with Genevieve is linked
with other fellows who share similar
interests and motivations for example
robotics entrepreneur Sergey Ilyushin
and neuroscientists
Greg gage David can zoom out and see the
larger constellation that he belongs to
here it&#39;s a group of technologists and
entrepreneurs who are driven by a strong
sense of achievement not only that David
can zoom out even further to see other
constellations which are next to him
here a group of scientists who are who
are motivated by the idea of giving
their gifts to the world and David can
find collaborators who are different
from him who are complementary to him
for example here is set Rafael a high
tech magician imagine the kind of
underwater magic magic that is waiting
to happen if these two guys got together
this is the shape of the community at
this point and the fellows program as it
grows the shape of this community will
evolve and build a living map anyone in
this fellows community would be able to
see where they land and find themselves
and their potential collaborators the
amount of latent information in this in
this world is already overwhelming and
we need new interfaces to explore them
this is what I am passionate about
building interfaces for thinking
interfaces that will give you an x-ray
vision in two hidden patterns and help
you connect the dots thank you
captain so what what we did a couple
months ago is we put out a survey to all
the fellows and they filled out lots of
stuff about them how they&#39;re motivated
what their backgrounds are what they do
but also who does something meaningful
this is not just couchsurfing
this is collaborations that are
happening and and then your software
tool takes that and automatically
visualizes that and pulls out these
patterns is that right yes so what do
you saw the one network that was we just
asked people who collaborates with whom
but there was other kinds of networks
where the shape was emergent it was
about like people talking about what
they are motivated by like the
scientists talking about sharing their
gifts to the world it like when we are
looking at interdisciplinarity each
fellow is like an interdisciplinary like
center big tag themselves with tens and
tens of discipline tags so the software
what it does it mines the data and sees
like who is similar to who across many
many different dimensions to me that&#39;s
quite an evolution to our directory on
the fellows website which is basically a
list and if you&#39;re a fellow right now
you can&#39;t it&#39;s hard to tell who do you
want to get in touch with but for this
the idea is this is a real tool it&#39;s
live now a fellow can go in there and
just cruise around and look and explore
and find people that they weren&#39;t
expecting just sort of serendipity right
absolutely you will find yourself
surrounded by other fellows who are
linked with you across several different
dimensions and fellows get really
competitive like I don&#39;t only have 17
spokes coming out of my circle I need to
have 87 Magel of maybe the one spoke
that you&#39;re connected to will change the
world thank you so much
