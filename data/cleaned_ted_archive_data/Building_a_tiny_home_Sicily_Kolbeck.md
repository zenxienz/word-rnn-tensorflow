believe it or not I built a house now in
many of your minds you&#39;re probably
picturing a two-story triangle over top
of square with driveway in a chimney
maybe some flowers if you&#39;re really
creative but it&#39;s not the house that I
built in September of 2013 to April this
year I constructed an 8-foot by 16 foot
tiny house on a trailer called La Petite
Maison I decided to build a tiny house
because while I consider myself a crafty
person I had never attempted something
dis scales a project and tiny houses
seem to fit perfectly with my
personality because once the basic
structure is built you can just take it
and make so many adjustments where the
basic structure has disappeared and once
the project was completed gave me the
opportunity to do exactly what I love
accessorized now I have to start off
with a lot of research and I should just
tell you I have seen every video on
YouTube related to plumbing citing
electricity and there are more than a
few so to avoid the looming panic attack
of the scale of the project is how to
take it one step at a time starting with
a base I attached to my house to a
trailer using bolts and washers &amp; 4 x 2
x 4 wood planks and I did this because
you know might help me to stay on the
trailer going 20 miles an hour you know
let alone 60 on a freeway so with the
help of my father I managed to keep the
house on the trailer but in February
2013 my father passed away in a car
accident after this I chose a couple
months break but I came back in
September with a determination to finish
this project beginning with the wall
framing was definitely a tough physical
challenge but I was extremely pumped to
find out that my house was only one inch
off square square meaning each of the
five each of the corners was a 90 degree
angle this meant I only had to push the
knit the walls that were nailed to each
other just a little bit to get it
perfectly square just made it extremely
easy to move on to my next step the loft
bored after board added to my loft and
finally it was completed one of the most
just infuriating parts of the entire
project was probably the math I just
can&#39;t tell you how angering it is to cut
something just to 16th of an inch
shorter than its supposed to be and you
have to scrap it measure again cut and
take in consideration the width of the
blade to just not mess up the whole
thing again oh just bringing me back
whoo so finally I could move on to the
interior meaning kitchen and bathroom
mainly now these two rooms you might
consider the most fun or even easy but
they were confusing as heck heck that&#39;s
the word are you I would have thought my
millions of YouTube videos would have
prepared me for plumbing and electricity
but they did not and I feel completely
let down and I just hope finally they
were done and I could move on to
decorating Oh can&#39;t forget about stairs
pain you seen these things I mainly had
to guess with these things and I had to
build these stairs around the window
with no framing that has the capability
to shatter at any second but completely
worth it because look at them they&#39;re
amazing they&#39;re amazing look at them
keep your eyes on them
and so finally my house was completed
after the amazing stairs and um I got to
move on to decorating hmm as much fun as
building was getting to pick out a fish
pillow from ikea was quite the rush I
have to say but building this house and
building this house gave me incredible
things before I was an introvert
self-conscious and I would avoid talking
to strangers let alone in front of them
at all costs but I got over that because
of this house I was able to speak at the
White House at the first-ever maker
faire and I gained a lot of self
confidence building this house and
learning the skills to do so has
prepared me for so many things for what
may come in my pathway next which as of
late is four years of high school much
to my mother&#39;s dismay but I&#39;ve been
prepared for not only just high school
but real life as well thank you
