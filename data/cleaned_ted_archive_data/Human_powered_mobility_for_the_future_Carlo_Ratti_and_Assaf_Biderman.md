hi everybody I&#39;m a soft Biderman can
Marathi and you know a serf and I grew
up in two smaller cities we embody Italy
and Indonesian and then over time we
moved to bigger and bigger cities grew
to the UK we moved to Boston to to New
York you know by doing that especially
it&#39;s called something quite exciting
they do not like today a great city is a
place where you have a lot of people
it&#39;s got excitement a lot of buzz and a
lot of ideas but at the same time it&#39;s
also City where you got a lot of issues
you got pollution you got a lot of
traffic jams you know this is nothing
new
Lewis Mumford was one of the greatest
urban scholars of the past century he
used to say the cities both heaven in
hell it is heaven because you know the
city is this place where we can all come
together exchange ideas and really be
richer but at the same time it&#39;s also
helped because the city is a place where
again you know we got a lot of cars a
lot of traffic and a lot of
infrastructure issues so what is
happened I have been doing over the past
few years at MIT at the sensible city
lab is really look at how digital
technologies are changing the way we
understand cities but also we can
transform them today you know digital
technologies are entering physical space
is what many people call Internet of
Things or in bigfooters computing is
that unlike computing entering
everywhere and changing the way we
change our environment outside ourselves
and so one of the things we want to
share with you today is how this could
radically impact mobility in cities over
the next decades now if you look at this
the first thing you want to share with
you is can we have fewer cars in more
humans look at this here you got every
dot here on the image is a taxi pickup
or a drop-off what you see here is JFK
Airport in New York then you zoom out
you see all of Manhattan in the
borough&#39;s that you can ask yourself
these days we&#39;d love to share we&#39;d have
to share everything like you know
apartments and rooms on Airbnb so what
if we could share mobility and if you
look at two points over there between
those two points we got
220,000 trips every year between any two
points in in Manhattan so we ask ourself
you know what if you could take
everybody
destination but if people could share
mobility what would be the minimum
number of cars now when you got big data
to analyze then sometimes you need big
mathematics or new mathematics here we
looked at using network science you know
in order to answer that question and you
see the results over here the results
are that actually quite stunning that in
New York we tell everybody to
destination when they need to be there
but with 40% less infrastructure 40%
less cars and pollution than than what
we have today now that is about you know
how we can share mobility but we can
also share not only the right but the
car itself and what you see here is
actually a self-driving car the 2-litre
years are like two little eyes similar
to the human eye that allow the car to
create a 3d model of the environment and
the exciting thing about self-driving
you know it&#39;s not that you don&#39;t need to
keep your hands on the steering wheel or
that you can shamelessly text while
driving but the exciting thing is that
we sell driving the car can give you a
lift in the morning when you go to the
office and then can give a lift to
somebody else in your family
or to anybody else in the city you know
if you combine this thing with what I
said before about sharing the ride with
sharing the car the combination of the
two really means the city where we can
take everybody to destination but just
with 20% of the cars we have today
anything about how different New York
would be if we were to remove eight car
out of ten thanks Carlos so we can have
fewer cars but what about human powered
mobility people throughout the world are
searching for new ways to move through
their cities powered by their body
cycling is one great example biking for
commuting is on a rapid rise throughout
the world bike sharing systems appear in
cities everywhere in fact in mid-2014
last year there were more than 600
cities with bike sharing systems in 49
different countries but there&#39;s a
fundamental problem with all of this
sorry there&#39;s a fundamental problem with
all of this the sheer scale of our
cities has dramatically changed over the
past hundred years now look at London
for example and how it evolved over the
centuries from the mid 50
hundreds you see it till 1850 through
the Industrial Revolution and then with
the introduction of the car and
underground rail look at how the city
expanded all the way to the mid 1960s
the sheer scale of our cities today
makes it so that it is almost impossible
for the average person to move through
them without motorized transport in fact
we&#39;ve studied this and we&#39;ve observed
that when it comes to cycling once you
go more than 15 kilometers so roughly
nine miles between home and work there&#39;s
a big decrease in the amount of cycling
Hill&#39;s are also a big deterrent for
people to jump on a bike on a regular
basis so to tackle this we divide we
developed a robot a standalone wheel
that you can put on any bicycle and it
enhances your body it expands that it
expands its capacity we call it the
Copenhagen wheel who&#39;s developed
initially at our lab at MIT and now it&#39;s
fun off into a startup called super
pedestrian inside the wheel there&#39;s a
motor which is also a generator set of
batteries about twelve different sensors
and three little computers when you
pedal the wheel figures out what you do
with your feet the most minut motions
and then it imitates you making you
eight to ten times stronger when your
back pedal it slows you down and charges
your batteries with the energy it
collects you control the wheel with your
phone so you can lock and unlock it you
can customize your ride as you move
around and you can receive information
about your physical activity you also
collect information about the
environment you ride through so you can
share it with friends and other cyclists
here&#39;s an example of a ride taking with
the Copenhagen wheel with a little
camera in the back so you pedal on this
just like you use a regular bike but the
sensation is almost like the ground
shrunk underneath you or that a hill
disappeared or if you think otherwise
like you became Superman now how could
the Future City look like we&#39;ve seen
ways to dramatically reduce the number
of cars by sharing trips together by
sharing ownership of a car by combining
the two we&#39;ve seen ways to use robotics
to empower our bodies so we can cycle
easily over great distances and through
hils now if we get inspired by what
happened by what happened here in Times
Square where we removed some cars and
made more room for people well then you
know that&#39;s an incredible transformation
of the city and we saw here in New York
but think about you could look at this
in multiplying and expanded in cities
all over the world thank you ask a
question before the two of you last what
would you say is a challenge that you
anticipate in implementing this new type
of technology in cities which specific
the bicycle one challenge for cities
well actually robotics has been around
for decades the challenge is to make it
small and to create that kind of
delicate experience which preserves the
experience of cycling as it is today on
a normal bike so when you get on this
thing and you really have to feel this
when you get on this thing it just feels
like normal cycling but you think that
you&#39;ve eaten a lot of spinach or or
let&#39;s say enhance your performance yeah
I want to say if you want to try to
actually god we got the wheel let down
there so you can try it but I wanted to
add something is about the other project
didn&#39;t mention it before but basically
we did this work it was published a few
months ago about sharing taxis in New
York but the first results were actually
two years ago and well you know what
that became to the attention of uber and
since then we started working with uber
as you might know over pool does exactly
that allows you to get a car by sharing
with somebody else so in a certain sense
you know sometimes in the one of the
things in order to get things
implemented is housing you start from an
idea from research in front of what you
do in university and bring it to the
real world thanks to you know different
partners anyways alright thank you
[Applause]
you
