for most of my career have been a
criminal prosecutor I started as an
assistant district attorney in the
Manhattan DA&#39;s office I then became a
federal prosecutor and eventually I
became a state prosecutor the chief
state prosecutor when I was the Attorney
General for the state of New Jersey as
attorney general I was the chief law
enforcement officer for the state and so
I was responsible for setting criminal
justice policy for overseeing all police
and prosecutors statewide and that job
changed the way that I see criminal
justice in America before that job as an
assistant DA and as a federal prosecutor
I only looked at the cases in front of
me I made decisions based on my instinct
and my experience but when I became
Attorney General for the first time i
looked at the system as a whole from a
bird&#39;s eye view and i wanted to know if
we were making the best decisions we
could make to make our communities safer
i also wanted to know some fundamental
things like who we worked arresting for
committing crimes who we were
prosecuting or charging for committing
crimes and who we were putting into our
jail this turned out to be very
difficult it turns out that agencies
like the attorney general&#39;s office and a
lot of other government agencies don&#39;t
actually track the things that matter
one day I walked into a conference room
there were dozens of detectives with
huge stack of files they were cases and
they had a yellow legal pad with them
they were trying to answer the questions
I&#39;d asked about who was in our system
and they were doing that by going
case-by-case through the past five years
and in that instant I realized that we
didn&#39;t actually know the answer to the
questions that i was asking some pretty
basic and fundamental questions and we
were making decisions critical decisions
every single day that impact Public
Safety without knowing whether they were
the right ones and all of this matters
greatly we live in a world whoops can we
go back sorry we live in a world we have
12 million in a country where we have 12
million arrests every single year
just five percenter those are violent
crime arrests serious violent crime the
rest seventy or eighty percent are
low-level crimes or misdemeanors and we
spend each year over 75 billion that&#39;s
the billion dollars on incarcerated
people in state and local jails and
prisons that&#39;s usually the
second-highest item in state budgets so
we spend an absolute fortune on this and
all of our jails are overcrowded
two-thirds of the people in our nation&#39;s
jails more than 3,000 jails are there
pretrial meaning that they&#39;re there
waiting to have their day in court so
when I took my current job running a
criminal justice initiative at the
Arnold foundation I came back to a lot
of these same questions I wanted to
figure out how we could do this better
in America and the truth is we know that
we can because we live in a moneyball
world we use smart data and analytics to
treat chronic illnesses to keep kids
from dropping out of school and even to
win baseball games and baseball is a
good analogy here because scouts used to
go out and look for players based on
instinct and experience and today they
use smart data and statistics to figure
out how to pick players and how to win
games Moneyball smart down and analytics
has changed almost every industry we can
think of but it hasn&#39;t changed criminal
justice yes but at ten one critical
example of how data and analytics can be
used to transform criminal justice comes
with measuring risk and determining risk
before I became an assistant district
attorney I assumed that everyone in the
criminal justice system made decisions
on risk on what risk an individual pose
to public safety whether someone would
be dangerous in the community or not I
thought police did this prosecutors did
this judges and jails but it turns out
we actually don&#39;t we make decisions
usually based on offenses that people
have committed not on the risk that they
pose to our public safety and you need
to look no further than who&#39;s in and
who&#39;s not in our nation&#39;s fails to
understand this when you look around the
country what you find is that the people
who through data and analytics we
identify as
being the highest risk meaning the most
likely to commit new crimes if we
release them fifty percent of those are
out many of them are released within
hours of having been arrested and again
those are the people that we worry the
most about and we most want to keep
incarcerated so that they don&#39;t commit
other crimes or acts of violence now on
the other side of this we do an equally
terrible job when you look at our
nation&#39;s jails you find that they are
filled with low-risk people who are
nonviolent and have often committed
minor or petty offenses and many of
those people overwhelmingly are saying
in jails because they can&#39;t make five
hundred dollars or a thousand dollars
now and this is because these if V
system errors are because we don&#39;t
measure risk we don&#39;t use risky decision
making and most jurisdictions don&#39;t even
know what risk someone poses in fact in
New Jersey we didn&#39;t even know who was
in our system the good news is that
money ball and data and analytics can
change this for the past year and a half
I&#39;ve collected data from over 300 us
jurisdictions from every state in the
country and from a lot of other cities
counties and states and what we&#39;ve done
with a lot of smart data scientists
fabulous researchers and really
brilliant statisticians is we&#39;ve built a
risk assessment tool that every judge in
the United States can use and they can
use this very simple tool to decide and
to figure out who poses a risk of
violence if they&#39;re released who will
commit a new crime has a high likelihood
of committing a crime if they&#39;re
released who doesn&#39;t who doesn&#39;t pose a
risk of violence who doesn&#39;t have a high
likelihood of committing a new crime and
this tool is now gone live in the state
of Kentucky and will go live shortly in
a number of other jurisdictions I
believe that Moneyball can change the
way that we process crime and do
criminal justice in America the great
news for all of us is that we know it
works it&#39;s why Google is Google it&#39;s why
the Oakland A&#39;s are in the playoffs and
it&#39;s how we can do criminal justice in a
way that will make our streets safer our
prison our prison costs much less and
our criminal justice system fairer some
people call it data science but I call
it Money Ball in criminal justice thank
you very much
