hello so I want to start with this image
because fans June asked me to say how
did I find the incredible name Steve
Shirley and it was I&#39;m lucky to be part
of something called Silicon Valley comes
to the UK and we take a bunch of us
techies here in San Francisco we go to
London Cambridge Oxford and we work with
the techies there and we were lucky to
be at the awards for the hackathon at 10
Downing Street they gave us a tour and
during the tour they showed us this
portrait and someone said of course you
know who Lady ADA Lovelace&#39;s and I said
I don&#39;t have any idea who she is
and this caused my friend Lynette Webb
and I once we found out who she is she&#39;s
the first programmer in the world she&#39;s
credited yeah so in 1814 1840s she was
friends with Charles Babbage who created
the first mechanical computer her father
is Lloyd Lord Byron and her mother was a
terrific mathematician and to keep her
from the poetry wild ways of her father
she taught her a lot of mathematics and
so when she met Babbage she started to
look at what he was doing and she was
translating a piece and she added this
entire essay which Walter Isaacson just
shared with me that he was in the Byron
collection the Bodley and librarian read
this documentation and she basically wax
poetic about this idea of
programmability could there be could
could you weave numbers the way the
jacquard Ian Loom works she talked all
the way to mathematics so one of the
things that we did was we started to
look at a doodle for her and so you can
see her up there in the top writing all
the way to iTunes cuz in this piece she
talks about programmability of music so
we love Ada she&#39;s our founder and that
got me thinking about the lost history
of technical women and so I want
everybody look at the slide do you
recognize anyone on this screen a cup of
people probably Grace Hopper anybody
else Hedy Lamarr so Hedy Lamarr
fundamental inventions in spread spread
spectrum and wireless also famous
Hollywood actors she&#39;s beautiful Grace
Hopper created
the first compiler invented much of the
idea of programming languages came up
with the idea of debugging bugs and that
whole code over here the ENIAC
programmers you know them University of
Pennsylvania used to be a job called
computer these were the first computers
a hundred women during the war Rosie the
mathematician we&#39;re working on a film
about her that Kathy climb and luckily
interviewed four of the six of them
before they died they wrote the first
sort routines they were not introduced
because people didn&#39;t really understand
when the Antioch was there that there
was this these programming this idea of
computer science I thought they were
like oiling the machine or something
Bletchley Park do you guys know
Bletchley Park the code crackers world
war ii also rosie the mathematician
equivalents more than half of them are
women of the 10,000 women on the people
on the park and they saved it&#39;s
estimated 11 million lives and ended the
war two years earlier with their
mathematics just astonishing heroics
other people did you know that there was
a parallel set of astronauts the women
astronauts for the apollo mission this
is a wonderful wired article right stuff
wrong sex amazing story about them and
also this is a Katherine Johnson
wonderful african-american woman now 96
there&#39;s a makers video about her coming
she calculated the trajectories for Alan
Shepard John Glenn and the Apollo
mission and when Jean Glenn flew because
they had added computers he asked to
make sure that Katherine had checked the
math or he would not fly and she I was
part of authoring 26 papers but her name
is only on one of them at NASA
it&#39;s amazing person so many many many
stories so the history we need to
resurrect it and last thing I&#39;ll quick
share with you is from the jobs movie
just current contemporary stories we
just movie just came out but for some
reason
Joanna Hoffman the product manager of
the Macintosh
or Susan Kerr at the top of the pyramid
there the designer of all the graphics
and icons and much of the icons that
you&#39;ve ever seen in your life we&#39;re not
in the film they didn&#39;t speak so we need
help to bring these stories back and so
I was lucky my friend
that web made this film about Dame Steve
Shirley what raises my awareness of the
astonishing things that she did in
England and we want to share that film
with you thank you because of the sexism
of the day I found that signing my
business development ventures Stephanie
Shirley Shirley being my marital name
got no response whatsoever
my dear husband have now over 50 years
suggested that I used the family
nickname of Steve things began to take
off
I&#39;ve been Steve ever since I was born in
Germany at a time of horrendous
discrimination and my parents did a very
brave thing they organized for me to
come to England into the arms of
strangers on something called a kinder
transport which brought 10,000
unaccompanied child refugees to this
country in 38 and 39 that two and a half
day journey with the preceding problems
associated with it has made an enormous
difference to my life
I love mathematics even at school and
much to my school&#39;s horror I wanted to
study mathematics and girls schools in
those days didn&#39;t really do science I
really fought to be taught mathematics
and had to transfer to the boys school
and that was a useful introduction to
the sexism of the workforce when I
actually joined them I lived in the
country and like many people really I
came to London because that was where
everything was happening my mother
bought a little house and a larger that
she had living with her at the time
introduced me to the post office
research station at Thomas Hill the
hotbed of about 2,000 graduates all male
they&#39;ve had a great portico in the front
researchers the door to tomorrow it made
a big impression on me and many other
people I left the public sector in the
late 50s and went and worked in private
industry for the computer manufacturer
ICL everybody would have coffee together
in the canteen every every day because
that was where people interchanged
information we were not in little silos
I was a mathematician you&#39;re a scientist
is an engineer it was an interesting
time where I learned a great deal and
became besotted really with the
computing industry the reason that I
left after a relatively short time was
that I hit the glass ceiling no matter
what I tried to do there I was getting
blocked
I gave my notice and decided to set up
my own company of women
managed by women driven by women it
would be a company writing software only
and it was considered laughable
you can&#39;t sell software it&#39;s given away
free and certainly not with women and
certainly not with women working from
home with much thought I called it
freelance programmers which described
what we did there was a lot of always
trying to present ourselves in a most
professional way when the phone rang and
to disguise the baby noises in the
background I would have a tape playing
of somebody on a typewriter typing very
fast of course we did a vast number of
early projects concerned with operations
research the sighting of Depot&#39;s for an
oil company the scheduling of lorries
for Tate &amp; Lyle sugar lorries it
remained a woman&#39;s company for thirteen
years until in Britain Equal
Opportunities legislation came in
although legislation was intended to
help women it meant that this all woman
company had to start employing men and
so we did let the men in as long as they
were good enough this great company it
was eventually earned 25 percent by its
staff and when we floated on the main
London Stock Exchange after that there
were over 70 millionaires among the
largely female staff
[Applause]
the fact that I nearly died in the
Holocaust means that I&#39;m very motivated
to make sure that each day is worth
living that my life was worth saving
and that is as strong today 75 years on
I had built a determination that I was
not going to let other people define me
to break through to do something new to
not be put off by the conventions of the
day I really really believe that any
individual can make a difference male or
female there&#39;s so many exciting things
going on in the computing industry that
if you have an idea a dream something
that you want to do then just go for it
[Music]
[Applause]
