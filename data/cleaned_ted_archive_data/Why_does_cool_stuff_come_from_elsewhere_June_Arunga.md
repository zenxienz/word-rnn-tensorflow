I will just share with you my personal
story I&#39;ve been fascinated by cool stuff
from around the world for a long time
since I was young a lot of the things we
bought at home the technology we used
and so on always had a little title
written on it at the back made in X
country none of those countries was
Africa and I always wondered from the
time of the child why didn&#39;t we have any
cool stuff that we made our television
our iron box everything came from
somewhere else and so the question why
does cool stuff come from elsewhere has
been my big passion for a long time and
a few years ago I left home and decided
to go to the United Kingdom in the
United States to find out why can&#39;t kids
at 16 get cause for birthday give for
graduation gifts when it&#39;s so difficult
to buy a kyv and if you have a PhD in
Kenya and this led me to learning a lot
about economics and about business and
business models and so on and then after
that I did a film long story how I got
to do the film for the BBC traveling
through the app content of Africa from
Cairo to Cape Town
just to see for myself the rest of
Africa that I used to see on television
and I was so surprised by a lot of what
I saw much of what I saw was politics
standing in the way of people achieving
their dreams lots of smart young people
who were just frustrated and kind of
sitting under the weight of
circumstances that I couldn&#39;t really
understand and now one of the
interesting things that I&#39;m documenting
is what we&#39;re going to see here today
what technology has done while politics
is still jogging on the spot to give
these children these young people these
old people tools in their hands with
which to break out of this mode that
they&#39;ve been stuck in and so my work as
a filmmaker is documenting the
applications of technologies like mobile
phones and what people are doing with
those exciting things the innovation
that&#39;s going on in banking and insurance
from that the innovation that&#39;s going on
in second-hand car industry just
housewives going online and import
in cars from places like Singapore and
Japan and bringing them in how this is
now fermenting political change actually
because the ports are getting overloaded
and the government is being forced to
think of adopting more technology to do
this and there&#39;s a domino effect that&#39;s
just marvelous to watch as technology is
liberating those of us who for a long
time thought we&#39;d have to wait for the
politicians to change things so I&#39;m
excited to be here excited to hear the
stories and see some of my heroes that
I&#39;ve just been reading about demonstrate
what their work is about thank you very
much
