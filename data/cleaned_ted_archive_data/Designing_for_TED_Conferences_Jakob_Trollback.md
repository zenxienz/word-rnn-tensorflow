hello everybody that I understand is the
second time we&#39;ve seen that today it&#39;s
nice we see your work a lot I&#39;m going to
show you some older tag titles I&#39;ve been
working with Ted since 92 and in the
beginning we just started to do some
things I was interesting with type
because there were three themes and we
wanted to do something that would open
the conference more like a feature film
title sequence so the first one from 92
I did Cal Cooper and then the one Kobe
so that was the first one that I was
flying so long and then it became a
whole exploration of what you can do
with type how you can move type around
in different dimensions what volume type
can get such etc so for heads 5 I just
did something with really really big
type and you can see that it was
actually futura back then before someone
came to the senses and switch to help
that account so there was a lot of these
things and every year I was trying to
figure out what knew i couldn&#39;t could do
to to make it interesting and so
area so for Ted six I had met Muriel
Cooper who had done a lot of the
information in organization and
interactive navigation in it and I was a
love the Borg collective so I thought
that I was going to do a title that was
just a lot of information intertwined in
a big cube I actually constructed in a
computer graphic the cube and in order
to make that happen that was the first
year that i introduced name for the
speakers which you understand when it
comes to copy writing and getting all of
the names right is kind of a challenge
so for the next year Ted seven I was
wondering if you could use type to
create type and so here you have all the
speakers for conjuring together to form
the three mean main themes and I&#39;ve kept
all of these short because otherwise my
six minutes would be 18 minutes so while
I was working on Ted 7 I actually had
started to think about rotating type
revolving them against around their own
axis is so they would be small object I
wanted to be in make an opening that was
objects but I didn&#39;t know the software
well in mouse and it started to orbiting
things around like a whole universe and
it created this thing that I knew that
that this was going to be either
spectacular opening title sequence
however I just hit on it because it was
not something that could work with Ted 7
and this is like one of the things we
have a really great idea you know you&#39;re
going to do it and then you sit on it
for a year it&#39;s painful but here&#39;s Ted
eight
[Music]
you
thank you so Richard actually used to
play these openings at the beginning of
every session and probably a lot of that
because I made his name very big enough
so we go way back anyway so what to do
more wood type can you make a whole city
out of type so when the conference came
to New York I did this
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
that let&#39;s also cut short and it&#39;s
actually quite beautiful the downtown
with with the twin towers and everything
and then I was rushing up Broadway I
knew I wanted to enter from Brooklyn
Bridge because that&#39;s what you should do
and then I had to get all the way up to
to the sony theater so it was a lizard
rushed at the am I did that in 63 hours
non-stop and just before we hit the
final rendering I took one last check on
the model and I had moved quite tries to
build it down to a union square so that
was another like three hours of rebuild
before we could have actually happen and
I was stepping out in actually New York
City and seeing that it looks like way
it was pretty cool so I&#39;m going to end
by showing two full pieces that we&#39;ve
done the last few years one-footed
global in Edinburgh and one foot 10 2010
they have sort of left the typography
side and become more about creating some
kind of an experience and feeling with
them and now they&#39;re huge teams working
on them at my office so there may be 25
hours of work put in into every second
that that we do and unfortunately these
these conferences of the pack tightly to
you usually have a chance to see them
one so maybe twice so here&#39;s first the
Ted global conference
[Music]
thank you and then I&#39;m going to leave
you with Ted 2010 and that is so rock
and roll so we should listen to that&#39;s
loud
[Music]
[Music]
thank you very much
