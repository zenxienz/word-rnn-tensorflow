for those of us that commute we&#39;ll spend
over a
I&#39;ve stuck in traffic I think somewhere
the one line we lost that sense of
freedom that we use to associate with
the open road now contrast that feeling
of being gridlocked with the last time
that you saw a bird gliding effortlessly
across the water have you ever thought
to yourself I would really love to do
that well you&#39;ll be happy to hear that
your flying dreams are potentially a lot
closer than you think
our team at Kitty Hawk is developing a
100% electric aircraft that anybody can
learn to fly in minutes there&#39;s a couple
of key technologies that are only now
making this type of aircraft possible
first is effectively the same
electronics and sensors that are in your
cell phone can allow us to control and
stabilize eight independent rotors with
this kind of control we can make flying
as simple as playing a video game using
a very similar set of joysticks and if
you go hands-free we can have the
aircraft just hover exactly in place
right where you left it the second
technology is batteries batteries have
been advancing rapidly with electric
vehicles and green energy and we&#39;re just
which is crossing this threshold now
where they start to make sense for
flight and this is incredibly exciting
for us it opens up an entirely new set
of design possibilities we can design
with multiple small lightweight electric
motors and a variety of different
configurations
we&#39;ll start by flying distances in the
range of 15 miles or 25 kilometers but
as batteries evolved this is going to
multiply rapidly so it&#39;s the combination
of these two technologies that are
allowing us to totally rethink flying to
make it easier than it ever has been
before my co-lead Cameron Robertson and
I are grateful for the vision of Larry
Page and Sebastian Thrun setting us
loose on this adventure in helping to
invent the
our personal flight on behalf of the
entire team I would like to introduce
the Kitty Hawk flier

thank you yes this is real for the first
time this week we&#39;ve unveiled the
functional prototype and by the end of
this year we&#39;ll be releasing a
beautifully designed aircraft that&#39;s
going to take this technology even
further at first we&#39;ll be flying low
over the water as you saw to be as safe
as possible
but as with all limits that will only be
temporary I realize that we&#39;re not the
Jetsons just yet but this is the first
step and what you see her experiencing
is this first step in a totally new type
of freedom we&#39;re on the brink of a very
very exciting future we&#39;re safe and
accessible flight will be a part of our
everyday lives
and we&#39;re the new open road is a
limitless sky thank you it&#39;s all just
just to get specific here so there could
be a product out next year and as we
just saw flying over water
yeah we&#39;re aiming the end of this year
to be releasing before the end of this
year and so it&#39;s classified as an ultra
light which means that you really don&#39;t
need like a pilot&#39;s license or anything
like that just anyone can do this yeah
in the United States
it&#39;s a ultralight aircraft is under 254
pounds which means that technically you
don&#39;t need a license we&#39;ll be training
people obviously to be as safe as
possible but you can learn to fly it so
quickly but to actually take this to you
know become your commute of choice
putting lee there&#39;s a huge level of
regulation and so forth that would need
to get cleared before that could happen
is that realistic yes for sure I mean
we&#39;re working with which regulatory
bodies that&#39;s a big piece of the puzzle
of a whole
I mean air travel right now is the
safest form of transportation and we
definitely intend to keep it that way
and that means working with regulatory
bodies to figure out every step of the
way so this is the first step that we
can take raha and then we&#39;ll be
progressing from there so we can&#39;t quite
call it a flying car because it doesn&#39;t
have the closet no you notice I didn&#39;t
use the word flying car okay but if you
can fly it to wherever you want to go
maybe
don&#39;t need that Kabat is that the idea
oh yeah I mean the concept of actual car
that flies I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to
see cars are extremely heavy their
design with a lot of extra weight what
is going to be the flying cars is going
to be very different
the amazing thing is that they&#39;ve
committed to putting one of these in
every gift pack next year thank you
[Applause]
