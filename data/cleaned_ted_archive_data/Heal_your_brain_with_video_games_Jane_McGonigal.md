you
thank you five years ago I hit my head
and suffered a traumatic brain injury
and as I shared in my 2012 TED talk I
invented a game called super better to
help my reign heal since then I become
fascinated with how video games and
virtual worlds might help other brains
heal and become stronger more resilient
I discovered a whole world of clinical
research and scientific experiments and
today I want to share with you four of
the most intriguing breakthrough so far
so this is snow world created by
researchers at the University of
Washington it&#39;s a 3d virtual reality
game designed to help hospital patients
who are undergoing treatment for severe
burns which is widely considered the
single most painful medical procedure
patients place no world by wearing a
virtual reality headset and using a
joystick to navigate the frozen
landscape exploring ice caves throwing
snowballs at snowmen it sounds really
simple but studies show that snow
whirled reduces pain in the most severe
burn cases by 30 to 50 percent which is
more effective than morphemes it&#39;s true
there is a video game today that treats
pain more effectively than morphine
you&#39;re wondering how it works well fMRI
studies show that players become so
cognitively absorbed in the virtual
environment that they are neurologically
incapable of receiving and processing
all of the pain data from their body
brains can only absorb and process so
much real-time information and this game
empowers patients to choose where to
focus their attention on a source of
data other than the nerves in their skin
amazing now what about a more familiar
game Tetris most of you have seen or
play this at some point in your lives
but did you know that Tetris can help
prevent post-traumatic stress disorder
it&#39;s true psychiatrists at Oxford
University completed a study showing
that playing Tetris immediately after a
traumatic event can block your brain
from forming visual memories of the
trauma which prevents flashbacks and
nightmares
two of the most difficult to treat
symptoms of PTSD how does it work well
Tetris essentially hijacks the visual
processing center of your brain it stops
you from converting the images that you
saw during the trauma into long-term
memories
so no flashbacks no nightmares I think
we should all share this tip as widely
as possible as soon as possible after
you see or experience something
traumatic play a visually absorbing
pattern matching game like Tetris candy
crush saga should work too and this can
help you avoid the most painful symptoms
of PTSD all right now what if you want
to change your real-world behavior but
you need a little extra motivation or
willpower a game can help here too this
is tree project created by researchers
at Stanford and Georgia University tree
projects situates you and a virtual
forest complete with blue skies chirping
birds and giant redwood trees when you
start the game you look down you notice
your avatar is holding a chainsaw in the
game instructs you to use a chainsaw to
cut down one of the trees and takes you
two full minutes of sawing back and
forth with your joystick which is
rumbling with haptic feedback the tree
falls you see it fall you hear it fall
and there&#39;s haptic feedback floor in the
room that shakes with a thud when the
tree hits the forest floor now the
amazing thing about tree project is that
players who were immersed in this
virtual world for two minutes
change the real-life environmental
behavior for an entire week the biggest
difference was that immediately
afterwards they used 25% less paper
product 25% less tree and this
difference was not observed in
individuals who read about deforestation
or who watched videos of deforestation
the trick only worked if you had that
first-hand immersive experience of
cutting down the tree yourself now maybe
we should all spend more time in virtual
environments that help us really see and
feel the global consequences of our
actions it could help us unleash our
natural abilities for conservation and
compassion the last update I&#39;m thrilled
to share with you is about my own
project SuperBetter the University of
Pennsylvania recently finished a
randomized control trial of SuperBetter
for
depression now you may remember
SuperBetter teaches you how to turn any
real life challenge into a game complete
with power-ups bad guys class allies and
of course epic wins and according to the
results from the pen study SuperBetter
is very effective for treating
depression in fact for the typical
player SuperBetter eliminates six
symptoms of depression in six weeks of
play so we are thrilled with that result
and it&#39;s just the beginning
we are currently completing an
nih-funded clinical trial of SuperBetter
for traumatic brain injury and I&#39;m
writing a book analyzing the data from
our first 250,000 SuperBetter pliers so
when you add it all up games are
treating pain preventing trauma curing
depression changing real-world behavior
for good I would say these are very
exciting times for all of us who are
investigating and proving the power of
games to make us stronger and help us
heal thank you
Shane can you give us an update on the
status of your research where&#39;s it
headed you know how&#39;s it going yeah so
we have NH funding through the end of
the year things look good for the second
phase clinical trial but I&#39;m also
looking for allies I need people to join
forces with me we&#39;re looking for more
resources because SuperBetter it&#39;s
becoming a movement and basically I need
help I need more than NIH funding hint
hint
anybody interested in helping J and you
can find her in there that would be
right um what-what are you playing now
just briefly just out of interest uh I&#39;m
trying to be my mom to level 400 of
candy crush saga it is the first video
game she has played in 20 years so and
she&#39;s at level 87 and I&#39;m at 243 so I&#39;m
totally gonna beat my mom yeah James
thank you so much inaudible thank you
thank you
[Applause]
