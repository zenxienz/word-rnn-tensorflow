so here&#39;s the fun experiment show an
audience a photo of a senior citizen
behind the wheel of a car and ask should
this person drive this car what you&#39;re
going to get is a policy discussion and
at the end all you&#39;ll really know is who
is on what side now show that same photo
and ask how might this person drive this
car what you&#39;ll get is a design
discussion and at the end is what you&#39;ll
have is several possible solutions for
how that person might drive that car now
online and in real life we are very very
good at having the former discussion but
we don&#39;t nearly do as much of is have
the how discussion the design discussion
and what I like to talk about tonight is
how we can get there so I&#39;m a Content
strategist and that means I spend a lot
of time thinking about what kinds of
content are made available to answer
certain questions I also do a podcast
where I talk about how race is portrayed
in different genres so naturally enough
I did a Google search for what films
might make me less racist now guess what
I found a whole bunch of top 10 list of
the most racist movies of all time we
only know how to tell you you&#39;re doing
it wrong and this is typical for how we
talk about race right we shame malicious
actors which we absolutely should but we
don&#39;t really distinguish between people
who are being malicious and people who
actually want to have that conversation
but are just terrible at it we pretend
like talking about race isn&#39;t a skill
but it very much is and if I were trying
to teach you how to drive a car and all
I did was tell you what you were doing
wrong you would never learn so what do
we do turns out there&#39;s a lot first off
we can start to reward good behavior
what&#39;s the last great conversation you
saw online where is that top 10 list if
we start to reward and celebrate great
discourse we will see more of it also we
can provide tools so civil comments is a
platform where if you want to comment on
a post
first have to rate to other comments now
this does a couple of things first it
forces you to acknowledge that there are
such a thing as good and bad comments
moreover it makes you apply your own
standard and this is very very powerful
we commit to the standards we set up
more than any other standard and one of
the ways you know is if you want to stop
somebody from cheating on a test study
out of Harvard says what you do is you
make them sign a pledge saying I will
not cheat on this test it&#39;s more
powerful than pretty much any other
intervention you can do another tool
Trisha problem at fourteen years of age
put together a technology called rethink
and what it does is if you&#39;re about to
post that hateful tweet or that hateful
Facebook post it says they&#39;ll pop up are
you sure you want to post this it looks
like it could be hurtful ninety percent
of the people who saw that stopped in
their tracks and did not hit Send now
this tells us a couple things one most
of the people out there are not evil
they&#39;re just thoughtless but what&#39;s more
annoying think it&#39;s just stop them now
maybe the best tool we have is to ask
the right question in the first place
the convergence Center for a policy
resolution gets people together over
issues they would never ever agree on
and let&#39;s say the issue were food
deserts they would never ask how might
we get healthier food into the inner
city it&#39;s too divisive what they might
ask is how might we work together to
shift consumer demand to healthier
consumption now everybody can see
themselves in that question if I&#39;m buy
or sell food oh did you say consumer
demand tell me more if I&#39;m a health
advocate oh did you say healthier
consumption how can I help let&#39;s think
about that first question how might this
person drive this car that&#39;s fine but
it&#39;s a little limiting what about how
might we do a better job of moving
people around now public transportation
is suddenly on the table whatever we
decide let&#39;s make sure we aim for these
three rules of productive discourse
number one neither of us has the answer
if we did we wouldn&#39;t be having this
conversation
it presumes our mutual ignorant not that
one of us is superior it presumes we&#39;re
going to learn something number two
neither of us will win and that&#39;s not
what we&#39;re here for winning doesn&#39;t
actually accomplish anything it just
makes one of us feel better for a little
while until the problem rears its ugly
head again because we were too busy
winning to solve it and finally we are
here to create something new this
presumes that we each have something of
value to contribute it is since the best
of us and not the worst so the next time
you see somebody doing it wrong ask
yourself is there a how conversation to
be had thank you
