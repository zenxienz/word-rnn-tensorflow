so a lot of people like donuts and I
think a lot of people think of design
like donuts they&#39;re kind of excessive
they&#39;re sweet they&#39;re kind of irrelevant
sometimes we love them so much and as
president RISD a lot of what I did was
fight for creativity and it got easier
to fight for creativity when this guy
showed up on my radar Joe Gebbia a
co-founder of Airbnb rizzi graduate and
began to develop a kind of entrepreneur
sort of like conference he showed up and
he said this thing to all the students
take the next step and so I&#39;d been
hanging out with students and I&#39;m
quoting Joe take the next step
everywhere we go and tell students that
there&#39;s this guy Joe Gebbia he&#39;s in
Silicon Valley he says take the next
step anything can happen everywhere I
went I would say this is what&#39;s as if
this is the future it&#39;s what it looks
like I were talking to students
everywhere done the same thing take the
next step it didn&#39;t began to wonder if I
was being disingenuous I was saying take
the next step but I wasn&#39;t taking the
next step was president for six years
and I thought maybe I hacked next up to
so it packed up the president&#39;s mansion
because I got the call from to folks
Hunter Perkins and also the John Donahoe
the seal ebay to ask fly could help with
design to help define design in the
context of technology and business and
so popped up all my stuff and hopped
onto the airplane and began to join the
sharing economy very interesting so I&#39;m
living an Airbnb every night in Palo
Alto etc and I jog around my air B&amp;B
there&#39;s this liquid four o&#39;clock go
jogging and I hang out at this 24-7
donut shop for a couple hours just to
think because designs about Donuts it&#39;s
kind of processing because everyone&#39;s
kind of maybe like sort of semi homeless
there and they&#39;re tired and there&#39;s a
giant donut there as well so it&#39;s a bit
surreal but it become a source of my
energy because from here I get to head
to kind of Perkins in the morning and
through that network I meet so many
fabulous designer technologists we&#39;re
redefining how thick now
should and will be there&#39;s this amazing
talent in the valley in San Francisco of
proud creative people trying to say that
technology is done enough design matters
even more now and why is that I&#39;ve been
asking them all of them why is that it&#39;s
because in the old days there were these
things called products they had no
computers in them I used to say do you
want me we didn&#39;t want them because they
weren&#39;t new and fabulous and fresh and
then the computer came along digital
technology came along and said hey hello
world you want me really we didn&#39;t want
a computer computer in the 80s did
nothing at all we don&#39;t want it it was
fast not really it had memory not enough
at a tiny screen and then thanks to
Moore&#39;s law and advancement of
Technology it got faster more friendly
it became something that you wanted to
buy I&#39;m sure all of you remember buying
computers every year in some case every
half year it was a great time for the
economy we all needed this thing because
it was amazing and then now on 2014
things have changed everything is
friendly to us everything says hello to
us everything is super fast everything
can record everything and we ask the
question do I want to buy any more do I
need it anymore and so it is in this era
where now because technology is not the
reason we want to buy things that design
is the reason i want to buy things
design is about not about how fast it is
but how does it make you feel how does
it connect to your life it asks
different kinds of questions and so
right now is a golden age or design can
make a difference civically the economic
impact of design is going to be huge now
design comes from the sort of lineage
about how style thinking capital d
design and i was thinking about this
love because design is looking valleys
about frankly money the potential for
advancement in the economic advancement
and so I was thinking how like it&#39;s no
longer that kind of design it&#39;s now
dollar sign design and this kind of this
is interesting because we don&#39;t if i
understand it why is it the design is
not about that dollar sign value it&#39;s
because design is usually seen as
expensive we tack on design at the end
making technology we know that making a
great product requires bring a lot of
design and it to it from the beginning
and so what happens is that the product
costs a lot more to make and that used
to be a problem they used to make a
product costly but now it&#39;s worth the
cost you need to sign from the beginning
so I was thinking about where it&#39;s
needed I have free sort of ideas it can
google this later if you like to see
because design is about economic
possibility it&#39;s also compatible with
the euro as well anyways thanks very
much guys now that I have you oh my
question for you okay sure you are one
of our best explainers of design and as
I said it can be kind of difficult to
explain it to people who are sort of on
the war left brain side and my question
for you is why is it that that there is
this separation between the people to
think about design and the people who
think about money I mean designers
should think about money right and it&#39;s
so it&#39;s in their interest to do that
well that&#39;s why uh people used to say to
me Joan your creative so don&#39;t worry
about the money yes I got my MBA because
money is a kind of medium and when
designers are designing for people if
they don&#39;t understand the economic
business models etc they can&#39;t design
great products and so for example the
right designer that in that fashion is
even Behar I&#39;m sure he&#39;s here but he&#39;s
mastered I think of the economy and the
design is one same thing and just as a
follow-up what is with you and the
donuts I love doughnuts that&#39;s all yeah
we all love doughnuts I love design we
love design thank you thank you chuck
