so Alan you spoke instead of about
cutting fossil fuels and so forth about
grazing and cattle I guess in a nutshell
the idea being that through holistic
management the idea of carefully managed
intense grazing of cattle you could
emulate what happened with ancient herds
and basically give grasslands the the
churn and the nutrients that they need
to grow and avoid desertification and a
lot of people would said wow that&#39;s the
most hopeful thing I&#39;ve heard in ages
what what has happened since then well
things have exploded thanks to you by
getting the word out to millions of
people finally it&#39;s out in the public
with common sense where it makes sense
to people and we&#39;ve made more progress
in the last 50 years so what had been
expanding is just exploding now now some
of the response to the talk it&#39;s fair to
say was that this just might be too good
to be true and there were some people
who said you know we&#39;re not sure that
there really is scientific proof of this
based on kind of controlled trials and
so forth are you are you sure that your
idea really works absolutely because
it&#39;s 100% based on solid science and
scientific principles it&#39;s been working
for 50 years on millions of acres on
five continents and all that is just
from successful people spreading the
word ordinary people that are supporting
families and so on that management needs
to be holistic embracing all science and
other sources of knowledge I don&#39;t think
any scientist can argue the difficulty
has been for sponsors
trained in reductionist specialist
fields to comprehend that that&#39;s where
the difficulties has no one threat of
the criticism seems to be that it comes
from people who don&#39;t like the idea of a
world that eats a lot of meat and you
know your your holistic management
allows for intensive grazing of cat
how do you how do you frame that how do
you respond to someone who says that
that can&#39;t be a healthy way to go really
there are three issues that come up the
amount of methane put out by livestock
whether or not carbon can be absorbed in
the vast grassland soils of the world
that are our grain producing source
because they will format grasslands and
whether or not people eat meat but time
is not on our side we have all the money
in the world we don&#39;t have time the
climate change desertification
biodiversity loss these are so serious
that people are not comprehending the
magnitude of it yet
generally all right now every year that
we delay on these issues would lose
billions of lives and trillions of
dollars and so even if you assume these
issues are wrong and that ten times the
methane has put out nobody eats meat we
still have no option if you want to
address climate change you have to
address the certification and only
livestock properly handled can do it no
technology imaginable can so give us a
scale how many hectares or acres or
whatever are coming and holistic
management it&#39;s say in the last year and
on what you project go yeah we&#39;ve lost
count it&#39;s just got beyond controlling
yeah we are now following a strategy of
encouraging locally led locally managed
entrepreneurial hubs around the world we
have about ten where people can from
universities governments environmental
organizations get together managed
holistically and spread the knowledge
that that is the way of the future
not reductionist management and the
demand is so great we&#39;re moving our
conference to London this year holistic
management X it&#39;s great great branding
you so so in the to your main focus
right now is is what or for the year
ahead well it&#39;s to try and get the word
out because there&#39;s no case in history
where any organization or institution
which is a complex soft system has ever
been able to accept new scientific
insights like this
a head of public opinion so even if they
want to change our bureaucracies cannot
until this adequate level of public
opinion change then they can change and
then you&#39;re going to see the human
spirit fly again but I must admit
looking at your TED talk and the
response to it there&#39;s this amazing
conversation raging there&#39;s some people
who are critical in some way and then
you&#39;ve got this army of supporters have
actually tried your methods and they&#39;re
saying no no no this really works my
land was transformed and so forth and
it&#39;s actually it&#39;s it&#39;s I think one of
the most successful conversations almost
like this you know the sort of tweaking
and and reshaping and testing of an idea
which I would love to see happen more on
the side so yeah I I really like what
you catalyzed there and I very very very
much hope that you gain success with it
and that it really does lead to carbon
reduction thank you thank you so much
thank you all you&#39;re doing thank you
Chris can I give you a present from the
millions of people you&#39;ll never meet
whose lives and cultures you are being
to save is it bite it doesn&#39;t bite it&#39;s
from Africa thank you so much thank you
[Applause]
