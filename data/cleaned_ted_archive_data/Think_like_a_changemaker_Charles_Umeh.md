okay um hey in Africa we believe in
several things both believe in stories
our parents 2-dose folk too long we were
quite younger and how many of us
remember the stories of The Tortoise the
lion
now what did those two his teachers
which time he goes understand they were
not really about the animals and Africa
is not about animals they had milanesa
than them lessons of values morals and
honesty so in a bid to continue my
storytelling I cut all the stories of
eleven young Millennials living in
Africa to teach a powerful truth the
weak African young changemakers can beat
the odds and the new trend of young
people becoming entrepreneurs and
changemakers is deeper than we think and
I will talk about two of them maple and
Sarah maple is born in the oil-rich area
of River State while maple was quite
younger he didn&#39;t have a home he
practically slept in a classroom because
his mom was a teacher but like every
young child he had a dream that one day
he was going to change the world so as
life turns out maple is grown
he&#39;s on millenia he&#39;s a changemaker in
the south south and parts of Nigeria
maple leaves the tribe of young people
in the field of fashion designing and
capacity development he&#39;s also published
author maple is an example of one of the
several Millennials in that part of the
world I chose mostly unknown change
makers who are making in fact so to me
he&#39;s a catalyst he beat the odds
Sarah is ganyan theorizing Nash is
passionate about preventive health care
and girl child education now Sarah share
the story of how her parents on
relocating to Ghana from Germany
discovers that they&#39;re all the savings
they have saved into buying their house
had been lost the person they acted buy
a house for them had interestingly
ripped them off so he has nothing to
start
cut they have to start their life from
ground zero but she has a dream to be a
nurse today in Ghana Sirhan&#39;s the
foundation another Sangha foundation the
funky foundational dress is responsible
for innovating and repainting schools in
rural Ghana now after the last time
Syria and I had a lengthy discussion
over two thousand clicks have been
registered under the national health
insurance scheme and she speaks about
deals for young kids now Sarah&#39;s story
among several it&#39;s an evidence of
perseverance now we live in an exciting
social era but the story of mibu and
Sarah
shows to us the part of the mindset we
should have a change makers now as
change makers we should not sit around
and expect a messiah to come and help us
which is not sit around and host pity
parties where life doesn&#39;t turn out as
we expect it to be
we live in an exciting social era which
young people created a Maysville
solutions in form of technology tech
software revolution and if you have not
visited the Silicon Valley of Liga&#39;s the
idea home on the TC hope you should
visit and find out what young people are
doing the Quebec visited last year and
the huge validation it gets a company
entrepreneurs it&#39;s super amazing now
listen carefully
how many thoughts on this whole knows
what this is called good how about this
I hope I get this now the mannequin
challenge
now what youthfulness and zest the dab
and the mannequin challenge went viral
now the young people globally who push
this lever acts for the permission from
the government but now what did we do we
have to co-create by creating our own
versions of dab and mannequin challenge
are the young influences we have a seat
on the negotiation table and I hope we
are aware of that the format trend of
also is a being a currency of power is
first slipping away to influences now we
have young influencers leading and there
are the people we look up to and that is
my own clarion call as young
changemakers everywhere we should refuse
and accept that we are stakeholders
which you refuse to believe we don&#39;t
have the power and accept to a
stakeholder and we&#39;re sitting on a spot
where we should have a stake each and
every one of us has what it takes to
make a difference each and every one of
us can become the story now inspire this
generation we&#39;ve had several stories
today at Ted and this is just a - of
what all of us can do so this is me we
should stop accent for permission to
live our dream there are daily
collaborations of young people online
that we&#39;ve been able to make impact with
and like the saying goes you don&#39;t need
permission you don&#39;t need anyone&#39;s
permission to leave your dream it could
be a bad answer go live your dream and
stop seeking for validation and if
you&#39;re wondering what this is this is
all about to do this is the coconut just
in case this coconut doesn&#39;t break
goddamn break young coconut thank you
