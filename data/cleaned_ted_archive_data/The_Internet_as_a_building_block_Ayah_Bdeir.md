I&#39;m really happy that Tom went in
between I was really afraid to go after
someone who was curing cancer
so from antiquity to the 21st century
I&#39;m here to talk about the Internet of
Things the Internet of Things is one of
the biggest buds were buzzwords of the
day but what is the Internet of Things
and why is it such a big deal the
Internet of Things is this concept that
our everyday electronic devices are
smart and they are connected and they&#39;re
hoping to make our lives easier so for
example your thermostat will be internet
connected and you can control it with
your phone or your speakers our Wi-Fi
connected and you can create playlists
remotely these are beautifully designed
elegantly executed devices that are
meant to make your life easier but
beautifully designed usually means
predefined which also means that they
are closed they are used as is you
cannot open them and change their
behavior but my first encounter with the
Internet of Things was not about
prescribed predefined devices to make
your life easier I was a student at the
Media Lab at MIT and I was hanging out
at Neil Gershenfeld lab and some
students showed me Internet 0 it was a
new project that they had just done this
was 10 years ago
where they had connected some components
written some low-level protocol and
through flipping some switches in
Barcelona the lights were coming on and
off in Cambridge Massachusetts that was
my first encounter with the inner of
things a system that was completely open
where literally anything could happen
and I very much remember that moment it
was a very distinct moment where I went
from being impressed to being inspired
to suddenly feeling incredibly empowered
thinking about all the possible things
that I could make happen with that
cheers ago to this day I came on the
stage and I showed my invention little
bits little bits the system of
electronics or building blocks there are
each of a finished circuit
each one of them is light sound sensors
motors and the goal is to enable you to
prototype and to invent without any
engineering knowledge whatsoever
little bits snap with magnets so you
don&#39;t you can&#39;t make any mistakes and
you can use them to create larger
circuits without any programming any
wiring or soldering over the past two
years we&#39;ve been blown away by seeing
that what a community emerge all over
the world in over 70 countries and seen
the things that they&#39;ve been making
things that we never thought were
possible an 8 year old who created this
line following obstacle avoiding robot
made of nothing but little bits in some
household materials or two designers
visual designers in New York that made
entire window displays for design store
made of nothing but little bits and some
construction materials today we have
over 50 bits and trillions of billions
of different combinations that are
possible that allow you to use this this
complex and powerful but most
importantly open invention platform
without having to be an engineer and
because it&#39;s easy to get used to this
place as a launching pad today I&#39;m here
to show you our next building block this
is the world premiere the sneak peek of
our newest building block called the
cloud module the cloud module is like
any other little bit&#39;s modules it&#39;s
small it&#39;s magnetic it snaps with
magnets it&#39;s it&#39;s small it&#39;s color-coded
snaps with magnets but most importantly
the cloud bit module takes one of the
most important revolutions of our time
the internet and makes it into a
building block that means that all your
interactions with the internet all your
experiences anything from the web search
whether Facebook Twitter Instagram email
can be embedded in this device you can
control it and you can trigger it and
represent it by a building block that is
ready to use so because as Andrew said
demos are always a bad idea I&#39;m gonna
make a demo so here I have a very simple
device where I created something it&#39;s
somewhat of it&#39;s like a doorbell where
every time we push the button it&#39;s text
message is supposed to send
so we&#39;re gonna wait for it to Commission
to the Internet so we&#39;re gonna give it a
few seconds so the idea is that you
don&#39;t have to be a programmer you don&#39;t
have to be an engineer you don&#39;t have to
be a company with millions of dollars
and funding to be able to use the
Internet as an as a building block it
looks like there it is a bad idea let me
try this again you&#39;re free to talk
amongst yourselves well I&#39;ll try this
again it might be congested Internet so
the idea is the Internet becomes a
building block that you can add to any
other building block and you really use
it to create and to invent your own
devices that some company may or may not
have invented for you
here&#39;s an example where you put the
cloud bit with a DC motor set it to

every day at 5:00 p.m. and now you&#39;ve
made an automated fish feeder move on
the DC motor put instead an mp3 player
at a speaker send the text message
hidden and now you&#39;ve made your swanky
little Wi-Fi speaker move out the
speaker the mp3 player put instead a
servo and send an email to your
thermostat telling it to crank up the
heat and when you get home your
thermostat is ready to go put one of
these in Tokyo and the other one in New
York stuff it inside a bear and now
you&#39;ve been able to create
a fluffy love machine across
international borders any one of these
interactions are possible because we&#39;ve
made the internet into a building block
that means that you can combine it with
light with sound with motors with with
motion with solar panel anything that
you could imagine and the really
important piece is that you may want to
use these to make a security network for
your home or for your baby&#39;s room but
you may also want your light your house
to light up and Buzz and celebration
every time you have a new Instagram like
the Internet of Things should not should
cast no judgement you&#39;re supposed to be
able to do whatever you want so our idea
of Internet of Things is that it&#39;s not
about the beautifully divine device
design devices it&#39;s not about the
prescribed smart devices it&#39;s really
about giving every single person in the
world this power this moment of
empowerment where they can think
anything is possible and they can think
of the one thing that they would like to
see happen and maybe you&#39;re the only
person in the world that wants this
thing to exist but for us that&#39;s enough
reason for it to exist thank you
