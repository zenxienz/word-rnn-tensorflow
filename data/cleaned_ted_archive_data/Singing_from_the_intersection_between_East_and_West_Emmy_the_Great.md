so when I was a kid growing up in Hong
Kong my Chinese mum and my English dad
wanted me to have both of their worlds
equally at home we spoke English so
during the day I went to Chinese school
where I learned in Cantonese and where
compared to the rest of the student body
I was considered painfully foreign I
found the situation lacking I did not
like standing out and so to me English
became a form of escape a thing that
made me special at night on my bunk bed
I would rage at the injustice --is done
to me that day and read Lewis Carroll
and Enid Blyton dreaming of a fantasy
land called England a place where every
day would be a summer holiday in 1995 my
family did move to England and imagine
my disappointment when I discovered they
had school there too at this school I
was still different but this time
instead of being too white I was too
Chinese I just couldn&#39;t win with the
jungle instincts of a kid in a lunch
hall I assimilated I developed an
English accent I adopted Britpop as my
favourite type of music I stopped
speaking Cantonese in public and then I
stopped speaking it at all I grew up and
I became a musician finally achieving
that permanent summer holiday I wrote
songs about the English countryside
about concepts like Arcadia or poets
like William Blake if I read a review
that referred to me as British Chinese I
would bulk because it&#39;s not how I saw
myself then one day a terrible thing
happened I turned 30 I looked back on my
life and I saw that I had spent half of
it in denial the biblical sky
fell from my eyes and I realized that
I&#39;m Chinese I was born in Asia I&#39;m
afraid of the number four because it
sounds like the word for death and if
you say cake I&#39;m gonna want to see a
turnip with the help of my mom and my
aunt I began translating my songs into
both Cantonese and Mandarin in Chinese
my songs took on new flavours
they seemed easier to sing lyrics
composed in the West revealed their true
sources in memories of my life across
the sea a swimming pool in LA moved to
the apartment sorry a swimming pool in
LA moved to the apartment complexes of
my childhood and at and Hollywood God
jumping into it morphed into the
backpacks and Air Jordans of the
international school boys

like all the best cities Hong Kong has a
Soho
as you enter Soho you&#39;re on Elgin Street
named after an English Lord for his role
in the opium wars in China where he
burned down the old Summer Palace they
called Elgin a barbarian in Hong Kong
they gave him a street and on this
street you can go to a classic British
store called Marks &amp; Spencer and you can
buy yourself a dry British sandwich on
the other side of Soho is the man mo
temple a beautiful red temple that the
tourists love because they let you
Instagram and while you Instagram you
might just raise an incense stick to the
God in the far left corner of the room
what the locals don&#39;t tell you is that
this is the God of War and one of his
jobs is patron deity of the Triads I
like to walk this route when I&#39;m in Hong
Kong enjoying the dialog between east
and west knowing that I to exist on an
intersection between them at times it&#39;s
been confusing and lonely but it&#39;s also
surprising and it&#39;s funny and it&#39;s
precious and I wouldn&#39;t change it
without these clashing cultures inside
me I&#39;d have no reason to make music and
I no longer think that I have to choose
between the
so before I play this last song I want
you to imagine that you&#39;re in the Soho I
just described alg√∫n below the God of
War above and all around you read Hong
Kong taxis and bubble tea
oh no everything&#39;s moving so close
started to lose my social Hey
see
I&#39;m in Soho started to lose my soul show
Hey
starting to lose my social

cold the opposite of volcano volcano I
saw you today when I was in Soho

go start until there&#39;s my soul shot so
