do you know the world consumes 12
and cans of tomato product every minute
of every day
Kent&#39;s like this sit at the end of an
industrial model that goes all the way
back and it depends on massive resources
the resources that we&#39;ve been talking
about the resources that we&#39;re running
out of at an alarming rate you might
wonder how we got here let me share a
bit of historical context in 1775 James
Watt invents the steam engine we
transition from manual labor to machine
based manufacturing tapping into what
seems like an endless supply of fossil
fuels in 1910 Henry Ford&#39;s assembly line
drops the time to produce a car from 12
and a half hours to 93 minutes a mass
markets born a mass market that
continues this feast on these abundant
natural resources fast forward to today
we all know that resource picture looks
dramatically different let me share a
few mind-boggling facts there are more
people than ever took us 12,000 years to
reach 3 billion we double that to 6 in
the past 40 years we&#39;re consuming more
than ever China alone will see 500
million people enter the middle class
the next 20 years the raw truth we are
running out of resources and the other
raw truth there are no sustainable
products today products like this tomato
sauce are part of a much larger system
that simply must end will change we&#39;re
talking about one third of the 62
trillion dollar global economy in this
next industrial revolution it&#39;s based on
our immense resource pressure and never
seen before information technology we
bring this to life using this everyday
can of tomato sauce the tomatoes in this
can were actually grown in canned in
central California now that&#39;s typically
where a conversation like this would end
but today we know so much more turns out
the can itself the can itself was
actually pressed in Northern Ontario
from steel mine from South Korea the
spices sourced from a US company but if
you trace them all the way
back they actually originated Malaysia
Thailand Vietnam and Peru
here&#39;s the full map of this simple can
of tomato sauce every time a customer
buys a can it sets in motion a cycle
that unconsciously uses massive
resources water energy natural gas we
used to focus on the tomatoes but today
we know so much more we actually now
know that the can is a major culprit the
can represents over 70 percent of the
human health in greenhouse gas
implications now if you&#39;re like most
people the secret life of a product like
tomato sauce pretty much secret but it
won&#39;t be not for long the facts are
increasingly at our fingertips
transparent for all to see this brings
me to one of my firm beliefs we are all
going to be naked so you might as well
get buff one of the winners that I would
bet on the producers of this tomato
sauce armed with the information that I
just shared they&#39;re challenging the
status quo they&#39;re employing practices
from around the world the results
demonstrate the opportunity over the
past twelve months their tomato yield is
up twenty percent they use two billion
gallons less water and their costs are
down 15% they&#39;re better off and so are
we as customers some of the
breakthroughs have been obvious like
700,000 gallons of water previously
wasted 700,000 gallons a day
previously wasted now being reused in
the production process other
breakthroughs are less obvious like
integrated pest management advanced
irrigation techniques but the point is
they had the courage to get naked and
they&#39;ve allowed thousands of people and
organizations to innovate for them NGOs
suggesting new ways of saving water
scientists pushing new energy
technologies our naked tomato sauce
friends they epitomize this next
Industrial Revolution gone are the
traditional four walls of the business
in favor of a more porous separation
between
those who produce tomato sauce in all of
us and many more who can help produce it
better with every iteration we move from
this collection of these blunt energy
draining processes to a more elegant
industrial model the tomato sauce
producers now that they&#39;ve tasted this
benefit their hunger pushes them further
and further they&#39;re considering enzymes
from the tomato plant to break down the
Tomatoes instead of the traditional
energy intensive mechanical processes
with more visibility they&#39;re connecting
to other products supply chains where
tomato by-product is becoming animal
waste there&#39;s no stopping this
revolution nobody can afford not to get
buff in this highly competitive
radically transparent world now we&#39;re
currently in the first leg of a thousand
mile journey but just like past
generations those who embrace the
revolution like Henry Ford and James
Watt they will become the heroes of
innovation and design as entrepreneurs
designers investors scientists the
opportunity for all of us and our
children is absolutely staggering and it
all starts with this simple very humble
can of tomato sauce thank you
