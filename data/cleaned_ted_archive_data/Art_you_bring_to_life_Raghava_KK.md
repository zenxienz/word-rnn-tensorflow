I&#39;m an office and last year I made a
turns book on Indian independence for
the iPad very patriotic until you shook
it and you got Pakistan&#39;s perspective
shake it again and you have the British
perspective as you can imagine not
everyone loved it but for my next up
gallery show I&#39;m doing something a
little different I&#39;m using brain waves
to bring perspective into my artwork you
see this EEG headset it measures my
brainwaves and it tells my computer what
my mental state is how attentive
meditative focused I am I want to
quickly show you a live demo meet Mona
Lisa 2.0 I&#39;m projecting my mental state
onto her when I&#39;m calm she&#39;s calm and
when I&#39;m stressed she&#39;s stressed I&#39;m
going to do the impossible I&#39;m going to
try and make her smile by coming down
now
come on I should have never named her
Mona Lisa Mona Lisa just doesn&#39;t smile
anyway I want to quickly show you some
of the other art projects I&#39;m working on
in collaboration with Sean Stevens from
new view this is a work I made for
people who bought loved Gandhi and hate
Gandhi use your brainwaves to keep on
smiling and everyone&#39;s getting along
stress them out and in regular calls for
communal violence among the cartoons you
can decide how you want to leave your
Gandhi this work is specially for my
American friends it&#39;s very simple to
read work but you use your brainwaves to
discover that there&#39;s an entire spectrum
between red and blue
it&#39;s called learning flexibility America
meet Venus 2.0 very fashionable and hep
because you just got off a visit from
the Indian censorship Bureau don&#39;t like
censorship use your brainwaves focus on
her and you can start unsettling her and
when you&#39;re totally uncensored her you
can even set her free you know talking
of censorship the one thing you cannot
censor are your brain wave because half
of them come from the subconscious so be
careful before you see my works online
next show because you bring my work to
life using your thoughts your brain
waves you know I want to leave you with
one thought you make a decision when you
see my work you can freeze the artwork
wherever you want or you can leave it
dynamic and really allow your brain
waves to keep changing your perspectives
to change and and whether you love it or
you hate it I hope there&#39;ll always be a
place for you in it thank you so much
