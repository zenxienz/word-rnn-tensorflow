I couldn&#39;t believe that this kind of
access to this type of money to be
accessible anybody everybody should do
it and it&#39;s legal business to me is like
watching the soap opera always trying to
anticipate what&#39;s happening
I&#39;m excited when I get the newspaper
can&#39;t wait to get on the read I probably
read about five six hundred articles a
week Wall Street Journal old USA Today
orbs fast track&#39;s entertainment like to
know what the seal is going like to know
who&#39;s in trouble and I read the articles
and memorized certain content that I
need not create stories he sits in this
very small room at a desk like one of
those old school deaths that it has a
big opening where you put your books
he&#39;s made it like an office nobody sits
at that task but Wall Street he invests
in stock from inside San Quentin prison
and he tops other people he&#39;s your
financial advisor
he&#39;s called Wall Street inside the
prison everyone knows him that way we
first heard about Wall Street through a
friend who teaches yoga at the prison
hatha yoga weekly inside San Quentin
Curtis Carroll aka Wall Street
grew up in Oakland mostly homeless his
mother was addicted to crack his
grandmother to Curtis and his brother
around the streets
Curtis hated school fell in with a gang
paid other kids to do his homework his
first crime at 11 or 12 was robbing a
mail truck with his brother someone told
him the welfare checks were being
delivered that day in his neighborhood
the envelopes were color-coded they said
so those were the ones they looked for
and stole number one rule is don&#39;t be
wet don&#39;t eat breathe criminals are
greedy on it we went it all all the time
wall she came inside the prison system
in 17 years old he was illiterate didn&#39;t
know how to read or write
one day he stumbled upon the financial
section of the newspaper thought he was
a sports section he used to have his
salary read it to him this guy asked
what
you doing with their finances section
you don&#39;t know nothing about that I was
like what&#39;s that
and a guy asked me if I played stocks I
hadn&#39;t even heard the word before tell
me say you know this is what why people
keep their money I mean he said that
alcohol like I stumbled across something
here is their regulation that a prisoner
can not invest in the stock market
not that I know I&#39;m Nancy Mullane
producer of life of the lot and reporter
on prison wall street feels that he is a
natural he was made to do it
everybody knows Wall Street everybody
they seek his advice out he comes up on
the wall all his pics you&#39;ll see the CEO
the correctional officers go in and
they&#39;ll be writing stuff down a lot of
sergeants talk to him about it he makes
predictions tapes them to the wall in an
envelope dated and they&#39;ve checked to
see how well he would done it was like
like a game they all play and he bought
thousand shares every tenth it hiked the
fight in how much my name is Troy
Williams
I just paroled someone i thankfully
state prison after serving under license
we have started to find that tool a
secret platform even vision called free
man capital right now Wall Street is the
CEO run over division on the inside he
would teach the stock program that&#39;s his
room there&#39;s four steps every person on
this planet that has made money has
mastered these four simple steps we
easily saving have about 70 people in
our class for our control
we teach them in personal finance buy
stock investments diversification
retirement and how to manage their money
that&#39;s it you got a lot of older guys
that Stan Clinton I myself pushing 50
you know a guy getting out who hasn&#39;t
invested anything into his retirement at
all what is this guy going to do half
the prison guards don&#39;t know who&#39;s
managing their retirement from it&#39;s just
somewhere
and he&#39;s being taken care of the first
time we came to San Quentin the prison
was covered in fog we parked and the
woman next to us looked over rolled her
eyes and said fog line good luck getting
in San Quentin just north of Golden Gate
Bridge is right on the fog pass it
famously shroud San Francisco perfect
conditions for an escape the passing of
contraband the procurement of a weapon
prisoners are kept in their cell and
visitors kept out the bay area where fog
and eccentrics and do-gooders pour into
every nook and cranny of the region
including San Quentin for two and a half
hours we sat on a bench outside the east
gate with all the others who couldn&#39;t
get in that morning the computer guys
who teach coding to the men the Mormon
guy who goes in to talk to the inmates
on death row the volunteer at the San
Quentin Museum who oversees their
historical artifacts including a cigar
box full of tiny nooses made by the last
hangman at the prison the woman sitting
nervously waiting for her husband to be
released after 15 years we waited for
the fog to lift my name is Clarence long
and I&#39;m in San Quentin prison means well
she&#39;s Estelle he&#39;s a long time he used

to stay up till 4:00 in the morning
studying the stocks I&#39;d be sleeping he
be up going through a portfolio and
reading papers when I learn how to read
I started reading candy wrappers and
clothing logos and it was like my mind
open to a whole different game I rebar
was a memorized content that I need I&#39;ll
take a vanilla envelope now spelling
into assistant he&#39;s it seemed teaching
classes only are people sitting in
bleachers listening to him once he
showed me if you could invest in
companies and get do then that&#39;s what
got me started learning buy the stock
the way of work is they have access to a
phone they can call anybody who will
accept their call this is global telling
you have a call from Wall Street an
inmate at 10 fine don&#39;t have any
computer time I don&#39;t have access to be
on the internet I would call home say
hey I want to buy thousand shares of
American Apparel and when I&#39;m on the
phone with them do get on the computer
online brokers each raid they&#39;ll tell me
what the closing prices are for the day
and I wouldn&#39;t know what to tell them to
buy Wall Street really has some kind of
far out ideas about finance he doesn&#39;t
feel that buying and holding long term
is going to make it for him
my name is Tom D martini volunteer at
San Quentin financial literacy program
being a prisoner he&#39;s willing to take
more risk if you talk to a hedge fund
manager here to tell you we never go in
penny stocks because the book says don&#39;t
go with that but I never read the books
so I don&#39;t know what to fear inmates in
California prisons and have jobs most
inmates make around 15 cents an hour
they don&#39;t get all of it some of it goes
to restitution some of it goes to an
account for the prison canteen when you
give that check for 50 bucks you should
be spending 50 bucks at the canteen or
your family send you $20 that&#39;s iron
income and if you&#39;re not putting on the
side you&#39;re not setting up that nest egg
for yourself there&#39;s a lot of guys in
there who are trading through their
families there&#39;s Sam who&#39;s got his
daughters that he&#39;s teaching they call
every week so what did you tell your
daughter this week what did she tell you
I&#39;m in prison but I&#39;m on just saying
plans field is going busted I can pick
the exact same company I can&#39;t buy as
many shares but technically we&#39;re just
the same
Wall Street is 37 now he&#39;s been in
prison for 20 years word of Wall Street
has started to leak outside of San
Quentin small community investment clubs
been reading about him online people
living paycheck-to-paycheck
trying to get a financial toehold are
being drawn his strategies and story
while Street they tell us has time they
don&#39;t to study the market and get wise
about money overall the goal is to get
the money to give it back to the
community when I look at how the
Gates and Warren Buffett give 90% of
their wealth away I thought what better
way to help the things that I&#39;ve
destroyed my sentence was 54 years a
life in prison try to reiterate to the
men that I&#39;m not teaching you some for
sure plan I&#39;m just keeping you to plan
it&#39;s fine to take the loss I mean it
happens you just know it it doesn&#39;t have
to lead back into drugs or crime or
gangs these men are coming home guys
we&#39;ve been locked up for 20 plus years
you&#39;re giving 200 bucks and it&#39;s like
goes up we&#39;re gonna pray for you stay
out of prison who do you want coming
home the animal that&#39;s been caged away
for years they&#39;re saying that as gang
banger that he was when he went to
prison or somebody that&#39;s coming home
thinking differently this hormone call
on the family now we can say hey do you
have a retirement plan you have a 401k
you need to know everything happening
with your money thank you
[Applause]
