so this is a real human brain this is
the front of the brain the back of the
brain with a spinal cord hanging down
and this is how it would be positioned
inside of my head and when you look at
the brain it&#39;s obvious that the two
cerebral cortices are completely
separate from one another for those of
you who understand computers our right
hemisphere functions like a parallel
processor while our left hemisphere
functions like a serial processor the
two hemispheres do communicate with one
another through the corpus callosum
which is made up of some 300 million
axonal fibers but other than that the
two hemispheres are completely separate
so as everybody here knows this was
really a watershed moment for Ted and
for Jill Bolte Taylor that was one of
the earliest Ted videos to go viral mega
viral almost 15 million people have seen
that TED talk today it&#39;s my great honor
and pleasure to welcome Jill Bolte
Taylor back
everybody nice to be here again with Ted
yes I&#39;m sorry no it&#39;s it&#39;s I think
everybody&#39;s waiting with bated breath to
hear you um that talk was of course
about your personal story surviving
stroke at the time you were a
neuroscientist
and you became your own research subject
um what happened at that talk what
happened to your life within the first
three months of delivering that TED talk
it was posted and it went totally viral
and within three months I was chosen as
one of Time Magazine&#39;s 100 most
influential people in the world nice
little girl from Indiana what do you do
with that I was interviewed by Oprah is
the premiere guest on her new soul
series and then Penguin Books bought
purchased the rights to my stroke of
insight and it proceeded to go
immediately to the New York Times
bestseller list that was the first three
months so so so Ted and Ted you know - I
just say Ted and I went viral together
and it&#39;s been a lovely experience yeah
changed my life entirely we got some
questions from Ted Xers around the world
I&#39;ve got two of them here I&#39;m one from
from Peggy Stefan from TEDx Excelsior or
Peggy Stefan she asks how has your
experience in suffering a stroke changed
your research you are of course a
trained neuroscientist how was it how
was it changed that well um
more important than that when the stroke
happened and I shifted completely into
the right brain and I had no left brain
that meant I was no longer going to be
in the lab because I no longer had a
left brain and I lost all of my science
knowledge I had to go back and relearn
that and what I learned along the way
through the process of growing up more
right brained is I&#39;m much friendlier now
than I used to be so so although I love
cells and I think that neurons are the
most beautiful thing in the world
underneath the microscope me being in a
lab is no longer the best place for me
so I have completely shifted my teaching
in the medical school into now I&#39;m
teaching on a more global level so so so
everything has completely shifted for me
you lecture you work with Kim
tell us what you&#39;re doing now wanna
keynote all over the world I keynote for
medical organizations any professional
organization corporations it&#39;s like
anybody who has a brain would like to
have a better idea of how to get your
brain to do what you want it to do we do
have two very different ways of
perceiving the world one more open and
expansive and one more detail based and
on a schedule and really for me
everything has shifted away from being
the scientist in the lab to being able
to come in and help people understand we
do have the power to pick and choose who
and how we want to be in the world and
every ability we have we have because we
have cells that perform that function so
I try to help people recognize when are
you already in your right brain
experience when are you in your left
brain experience and how can we create
more of that middle path how do we
really find that balance between the two
so it&#39;s a you know I think our first job
as human beings in the world is to love
one another I think that is our primary
compassionate way of being it is the
essence of our right brain and when we
come into the world through that
compassion and that love and that
openness then all the details we can we
can play together we can approach one
another with curiosity and compassion I
guess that&#39;s a bit of a window into
where you&#39;re headed where am I headed
next really really into the children I
started a not-for-profit of course Jill
Bolte Taylor brains and I care about
educating the public about the
resiliency and the beauty of the human
brain I care about the children my
family my not-for-profit is working with
Goldie Hawn and the Hawn foundation they
have a beautiful program called the mind
up program which is actually teaching
children about the amygdala about the
hippocampus about the different regions
of the brain and helping children have
some emotional accountability and with
emotional accountability comes a level
of higher cognitive accountability so
I&#39;m doing that and then there&#39;s a movie
on a horizon and if and when that ever
happens it will take you on that journey
in into who you are as a whole into you
heart as a right brain it will take you
there and it will let you make your own
decision would I come back and what
would I be like if I were a
little bit more right brained in the
world Wow before you go any last
thoughts you know I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m really
grateful to this organization
Ted changed my life in 2008 when that
TED talk happened I was allowed to be
vulnerable I opened my heart I went out
on the limb in that presentation and
this organization you held me in that
beautiful space of safety and together
we made what that TED talk became and I
will always be eternally grateful
because my life has changed it&#39;s given
me the opportunity to really be Who I am
in the world so I&#39;m thankful
[Applause]
