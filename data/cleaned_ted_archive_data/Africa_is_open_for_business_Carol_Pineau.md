[Applause]
well thank you so much in Mecca it&#39;s
wonderful to be here as a Mecca said a
couple of years ago I did a documentary
called Africa open for business
this was really just a documentary of
ten case studies of entrepreneurship it
really shouldn&#39;t have been a big deal at
all
all of a sudden the common Film Festival
was calling me the World Economic Forum
Kofi Annan wrote me why because I showed
entrepreneurship in the one place that
nobody thought there was
entrepreneurship Africa is so incredibly
ripe for entrepreneurship I started this
film project because I was frustrated as
a journalist I covered Africa&#39;s wars and
famines but when I would call my editor
and say you cannot believe what is
happening with cell phones right now in
Africa it is changing the face of the
entire continent they would say oh yeah
yeah interesting can you going like
follow those refugees somewhere I wanted
to show the untold story as a journalist
that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to be doing and
so I wanted to tell the story that
wasn&#39;t being told after there&#39;s
entrepreneurs are extraordinary I think
there is something in the culture that
really brings this out in people I
always say that if you give an American
a plank of wood and a nail and say put
this in the Americas okay well where&#39;s a
hammer oh I don&#39;t have one
sorry can&#39;t be done you send that to an
African they said well let&#39;s see I got a
brick over here I got a rock I got my
shoe I&#39;ll do it you bring that into the
business arena and something incredible
is going to happen and that is what I
saw time and time again when I was doing
my film I don&#39;t actually have the
clicker to be able to do this so maybe
you can go ahead but if we can show the
first don&#39;t put this is from Africa open
for business and this is from Lagos a
women&#39;s and children&#39;s clothing
[Music]
welcome Tom who started that
in 1996 I went to Italy and I sucked in
Benetton and I said this is what I want
to do in Nigeria the response was
incredible people actually wanting the
made in Nigeria garment it&#39;s like when&#39;s
the label I want the label outside I
want everybody to mom wearing
rough-and-tumble I couldn&#39;t believe it
we don&#39;t export now a 40% of the 120
million people in Nigeria children I
have a potential of a huge market here
there&#39;s so much goodness in Nigeria the
possibilities of Nigeria they are so
immense and we are so dynamic other
people the next one that I want to show
you know it&#39;s easy to say that there&#39;s
business in the nice places Ghana
Botswana all of that but I wanted to
show that the entrepreneurial spirit is
alive and well everywhere in Africa and
so I took the worst of the worst Somalia
Somalia has not had a government for
more than a decade when the government
fell and the airline stopped running one
man thought business opportunity so here
is history
[Music]
we started in 1991 after the glass of
Somali government after the war started
in Somalia and the people were in need
for air transportation that&#39;s when we
started our Airlines there&#39;s no central
government to maintain their wars we put
the air box we exert their votes but
sometimes it&#39;s difficult without having
a government and sometimes it is
suppressed not to have a government
corruption is not a problem corruption
is not a problem because there is no
government they are present Nigeria
Somalia is home so we have to stay there
and we are staying for long time
all that with language recently at a
conference in Africa and as everyone was
complaining about their governments they
finally got up said why don&#39;t you just
take the Somali method get rid of your
government and then the next one is
somebody who actually will be speaking
to you tomorrow and you can say here&#39;s
one of my greatest heroes he started
what is now one of the largest cellphone
companies in Africa which by definition
means probably one of the largest in the
world because Africa is one of the
greatest growth areas in this industry
and here is experience
I don&#39;t deform change light Oh our goal
is to make fun affordable for the need
of the population the week that we
launched we have 35,000 people a two
year of operation we are about 850,000
subscribers when we luncheon Kananga
one of the old lady took before that&#39;s
my son but where are you
we built this tower during the war in
Congo at that time the fighting was
close to Kinshasa here this tower here
was built by the locals and when this
tower was done we were protected by the
population a youth company he told me he
started with 1.5 million dollars as an
investment five years later it is valued
at more than 1.5 billion that means that
five years ago I had put $1,000 into his
company I would be a millionaire today
and here can we go back five years from
now
Africa offers the highest return on
direct investment in the world and yet
it receives the least amount of direct
investment in the world that doesn&#39;t
make sense
money goes where money makes money so
why is it money going into Africa now if
you ask investors they&#39;ll most often say
it&#39;s because of risk I don&#39;t believe it
if you look at a case like Botswana
Botswana has a higher sovereign credit
rating for Japan transparency
international listed as one of the least
corrupt countries on earth they have
never had a coup or any instability why
isn&#39;t money flooding into both SWANA
they are having as hard of a time as
anybody it is because our perception of
risk and the perception of risk in
Africa far out distances the real risk I
am an American I grew up like most
Americans being told eat everything on
your plate their starving children in
Africa they also used to tell us that
there were starving children in China
and in India look what happened
we&#39;ve been India last year and someone
told me that the joke in India right now
is that Indians that Indians hell is
that American parents now say that our
finish up all your homework there&#39;s an
Indian waiting to take your job we are
taught this world order
we are the wealthy nation and we must
give to those poor helpless Africans the
problem with this vision of a world
order is it closes our minds to what is
really happening and that&#39;s that
Africans are able to take care of their
own affairs this iconic image of the
starving African child with the
distended belly and the flies on the
face it&#39;s done so much doing to bring
money into the NGOs coffers I don&#39;t
think it&#39;s done very much for Africa in
fact I think in many ways it is killing
the best chance in Africa has for
development because our world order our
belief in this world order our belief in
this world order is blinding us to the
dirty little secret and that is it Aid
has never ever developed a nation it is
trade and investment that is how China
did it that is how India did it and that
is how Africa is doing it today I want
to show you a page from a website that I
love what most people are saying about
Africa charities get relief money
what Africans are saying they need trade
jobs investment this is from the website
afford Africans for development in
London Africans know exactly what they
need Africans are no different than
anybody else they want a better life for
their children if they have money in
their pockets they will build schools
they will build clinics they will build
a better future for themselves you say
that if you give a man a fish he eats
for a day if you teach a man to fish he
eats for a lifetime well what I think is
more important is if you open up a fish
processing plant then the whole village
is going to eat the whole village is
going to be closed the whole villages
children are going to
go to school that&#39;s what trade and
development can do when I started in
this whole venture with the film I
didn&#39;t think that Africans would really
be interested in it I thought you know
come on Africans can walk outside of
their door and they&#39;ll see a new Africa
why do they need some foreigner to come
and tell them what is Africa the truth
is that Africans have been really moved
by the film and I&#39;ve come to understand
why if half of Africa lives on $2 or
less a day and that is a terrible figure
that is true but by definition the other
half does not if we truly have an
unbiased media but is telling us a
balanced story about Africa then half of
our stories would be about that other
half of Africa that is not living on $2
a day where are those stories I never
see those kinds of stories what I&#39;ve
come to realize is the media is like a
mirror when I look in the mirror an
American television between news and
sitcoms and documentaries whatever I see
something that is somewhat reflective of
my life as an American when an African
looks in the mirror of the media they
don&#39;t see themselves they see a
caricature they see a one-dimensional
portrait of what is Africa now for years
I had heard Africans laugh about this
you know ohyou America is always asking
us do we ever wear shoes did we grow up
with monkeys in our house we grow fig
trees what I never heard was a
tremendous pain of this when my film
came out I started getting hundreds of
emails from people talking about the
pain that they felt from the way that
the media had portrayed them and I want
to show you just three quotes from
people who had written to me these
emails were just heartbreaking to
realize what we&#39;re doing to Africa by
the constant barrage of media images and
I think that it&#39;s important to remember
that during colonialism one of the
objectives of the colonial powers was to
make sure that the colonies could never
compete economically doesn&#39;t the media
the negative media image make sure of
that too the last one is the one that
really gets to me here in Ireland you
would almost want to walk the streets
with your face covered because of the
way that we are portrayed we really have
to ask
self what are we doing to Africa with
this media image we talk about Africa in
the media as though Africa has no
economic life but it&#39;s even worse than
that in the Western media ask yourselves
when was the last time you saw a film it
was a love story in Africa of Africans
what was the last time you saw a buddy
flick when was the last time you saw a
chick flick I&#39;ll bet never we talk about
Africa as though it is just one
dimension
wars famines or wildlife the Ugandan
ambassador in Washington is always
saying to me since I do a lot of reports
for CNN how come you guys never show
Kampala in the weather so we treat
Africa so it has no economic life no
love life no family life no civic life
and no weather a lot of you coming in
today you came in for yesterday if you
flew in during the day you got the
magnificent sight of flying over
Kilimanjaro the snow cap on the crater
it&#39;s beautiful during the eighteen
hundred&#39;s the Royal Society the Royal
Geographic Society in London refused to
take the word of any African that this
was actually snow Africans knew there
was snow they might not have called it
snow but they knew that it was wet they
knew that it was white and they knew
that it was cold but no the Royal
Geographic Society wasn&#39;t going to
believe them until an English gentleman
would tell them that&#39;s kind of what we
do in the media today if a journalist
goes into a refugee camp they see
Africans on the ground who are
delivering aid to other Africans it is
Africans who are responsible for getting
that ate out who do they go to interview
what I like to call the floor and savior
as somebody recently wrote according to
the the Western news media if Africans
are in bad situations like Wars or
famines they can just twiddle their
thumbs and rest assured that YT will
soon come to save them that&#39;s kind of
what we do in the media we should be
letting Africans tell their own stories
and a really scary part about having
this is a thing of the foreign Saviour
is behind them are sort of the masses of
the Africans now
and who said that one death is a tragedy
a million nothing more than a statistic
when you show africans as the masses
when we don&#39;t hear their voices when we
don&#39;t light them properly and so you
don&#39;t see the playable motion over their
faces when we don&#39;t hear their voices
when we don&#39;t name them or when we do
name them we don&#39;t even pronounce their
names correctly we talk about them as
the masses and then when something
happens like Rwanda you say oh what a
pity
and when Darfur happens Oh such a shame
I really must write to my congressman
but you don&#39;t really feel it because
again it&#39;s just a statistic you know
while we are ignoring what is happening
in Africa in the West somebody else is
not China I just came back from Shanghai
the African Development Bank meetings
and again listen to that the African
Development Bank annual meetings that
are always held in Africa they were in
Shanghai the whole week all I could
think about was who is this incredible
love affair going on between the Chinese
and the Africans China is investing
unbelievable sums of money into Africa
it is on the level of the Marshall Plan
American and European businesses have
got to wake up to see this because right
now China is in there the great thing
for Africa though is it for the first
time ever Africa has choices when
they&#39;re getting a raw deal from somebody
else I can say no thank you actually
I&#39;ve got a better deal over here and
that&#39;s a great thing for China now I&#39;d
like to play you a short clip of my next
film this is a film that&#39;s actually
going to be coming out in the next
couple of weeks
it&#39;s called Africa investment horizons
my last film I felt like it was really
you know I was thrilled with what
happened with it but I felt like the
real challenge was reaching outside of
the choir how do you get the people who
never think about Africa the people who
could care less who never would have
signed up for a TED conference like this
how do you get them interested in Africa
and I think maybe the way you do it if
you go after their own self-interest
sort of a message of forget about all
those problems of Africa but stock
markets are doing incredibly well from
the highest returns in the works
are you having enough invested to be in
so that is sort of the goal of the next
film this is a short clip of it after
the investment arrived they offer the
highest return of the retina vestment in
the world had the fastest growing stock
market some of the world&#39;s most rapidly
growing economies and all exports rival
in the Middle East most people would
never hit and although this is an Africa
[Music]
[Applause]
I had me have any any money in the US or
European market most of my earnings
money investments are in Ghana and other
African countries we&#39;ve had about four
or five bull markets in which we
exceeded hundreds and hundreds man
listing more and more private equity
firms creating Africa dedicated plants I
think for the first time Africa
dedicated hedge funds energy standing
you but that certainly avail where the
sign that Africa I think a continuous
keep some international
have a better return than investing
imagine 500 and that&#39;s over more than 10
days on average they&#39;ve outperformed
every marketing in the world even the
kinds of returns that people dream about
we don&#39;t expect to be Wall Street
overnight we don&#39;t expect to be the city
over and overnight but we should be able
to compete with the likes of Malaysia
and IRS you have to have a good business
sense and you have to really focus on
the finances the valuations just as you
would do in any making any kind of
investment you don&#39;t just walk into
Africa I think it&#39;s going to be the same
as Minnesota it&#39;s not going to happen
Africa is Africa and you either up on
what you&#39;re about to to run into or
you&#39;re going to sort of be a bit slow
all in all there&#39;s money to be made
it&#39;s real and everything ready moved is
an office
[Music]
before leaving you today I&#39;d like to
leave you with two questions the first
is how would we live our lives if
development in Africa really mattered to
us 300 million Africans live on a dollar
or less a day and yet the average
European cow
thanks to European subsidies lives on $2
a day how would we negotiate our trade
agreements if development really
mattered to us how would we change our
lives
if development really mattered to us the
other question that I want to leave you
with but I hope you&#39;ll think about
during this whole four days is what can
you learn from Africa and by that I
don&#39;t mean what can you learn about
Africa as as far as them taking charge
of their own programs and then feeding
it back to them I mean what in your life
don&#39;t you know that Africans could teach
you when I was filming Africa open for
business I learned about corporate
social responsibility from the heart in
a way that wasn&#39;t concerned about the
shareholder that wasn&#39;t concerned about
being listed as the best place to work
but was really from the heart it was
about the extended family of Africa
being brought into the business arena
and it was extraordinary those are the
kinds of lessons that I think if we stop
talking and start listening to Africa we
might start learning things from Africa
instead of always thinking we can tell
Africa something about themselves so
with that thank you so much it&#39;s been a
pleasure thank you
[Applause]
