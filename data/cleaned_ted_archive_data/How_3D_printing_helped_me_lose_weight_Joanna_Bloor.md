I have a memory problem in my head I
imagine myself as a supermodel slash
athlete it&#39;s not until I see a
photograph of myself that I flinch and
realize the truth No do I really look
like that now you can chalk this up to
some amazing self-confidence but for me
it&#39;s actually a problem it&#39;s a problem
because of a promise I made to myself on
a beach in Hawaii fifteen years ago I
was morbidly obese walking was difficult
walking on sand was painful and it was
sand that brought me to my aha moment
and a promise to myself to lose a
hundred pounds and run a marathon
surprisingly the marathon was the easy
part I finished my first marathon less
than two years later and have run
multiple since and in the process fell
in love with running and Lila Mayan
acronym for late in life athlete was
born the hundred pounds though that&#39;s
been a different story
that&#39;s been a promise I&#39;ve kept breaking
because of that image in my head you see
anybody who has struggled with losing
weight will tell you that the result on
the state scale come from what you put
in your mouth and what you eat and those
choices those choices of should you eat
that happen all day every day and when
I&#39;m out making choices about whether I
should have lunch or that tasty snack
well the scale isn&#39;t there that picture
of the supermodel slash athlete while
she is and she gives me permission
permission to just have that one thing
one thing choice at a time and I was
obese again clearly I needed a different
promise so I went looking and started to
think about what would actually motivate
me and keep
course to being Delilah but lighten life
athlete that I really really wanted to
be I also wondered if it was time to
solve the real problem that image in my
head I turned to 3d printing I&#39;d like to
introduce you to 3d Lila yes she&#39;s a 3d
printed me I cried the first time I saw
her more real to me than any photograph
but she&#39;s become this amazing tool when
I&#39;m out of grocery stores and
restaurants I take her out and I look at
her and I say this is what you look like
what choice will you make now and my new
measure of success well I get her
reprinted every 90 days and because
she&#39;s a digital file I know now down to
the millimeter how much this is changing
and for me that&#39;s the only measure of
success that counts with all of the
technology that we have and solutions we
have today to measure success on our own
personal weight loss and fitness
journeys I think we should ditch the
scale I&#39;ve turned to 3d printing to
measure my success what will you choose
thank you
