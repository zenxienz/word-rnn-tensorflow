said he&#39;d a clicker here sorry about
that I didn&#39;t get it clicker sorry thank
you unless you count lunch and recess I
was one of those kids that did not care
for school or for studying when I was
younger and as I grew older my interest
in school math in particular was
completely non-existent when I was in
high school I sported this absolutely
terrible
mullet spike haircut and I had friends
that would literally let me copy all of
their homework math science mythology I
literally had help with all of it and I
remember it was my second senior year or
my second because I skipped so much
school the first year I couldn&#39;t pass
and so during the second year I had
taken the exact amount of credits I
needed to graduate so long as I actually
passed the classes I would graduate well
in this pathology class we had a collage
that we all had to turn in and you could
not pass this class unless you did the
collage well the whole semester goes by
and I of course hadn&#39;t even started my
collage and elastic comes and the
teacher says everybody turn in your
collage and I panicked realizing I&#39;m
going to have a third senior year
because I haven&#39;t even started this and
then my best friend Larry Imhoff walked
up and he said Jason do I know you
better than anybody and I said yes why
he goes cuz I knew you wouldn&#39;t do your
homework and you wouldn&#39;t graduate so I
did two collages so that you could and
he gives me a second collage and to this
day that&#39;s the reason I graduated
and the kicker is that the claws that he
did for me I got an a-minus on the
collage he did for himself he got a B+
yeah
and we still laugh about it to this day
well after graduation life continued on
like one big spring break I mean we
would go out to bars and party nightly
and having bad hair and working out was
literally a priority for me at the time
as long as we could party chase girls
and goof off which we definitely did a
lot of things seemed good life seemed
good relative to what I knew then of
course but it still seemed good my life
was maybe a mile wide but it was only an
inch deep and before I knew it over ten
years had gone by and I was still living
in the exact same way well then in 2002
life took a dramatically different turn
but it started off like many other
nights with me going to a karaoke bar
with some friends they have my friend
Angela was on a first date and they had
too much to drink and they needed a ride
home so I went to pick them up I wound
up singing a song and I had a coke paid
the bill and left well unbeknownst to us
there was two thugs there that would get
tipped off by a server as to who had
cash and they would attack and rob you
when you left so as we leave this bar I
was attacked from behind from my
perspective I didn&#39;t see anything at all
I just heard and felt this deep thud in
the back as something smashed into the
back of my head and I saw this flash of
light similar to what you hear boxers
described when they get knocked out and
the next thing I knew I was on my knees
just getting pummeled you know from all
different directions well
I remember having this feeling that I
was going to die
right then and right there and I then
had the next fuel and I had was this
strange acceptance that life was about
to end and then this fight-or-flight
instinct came on and I had no chance to
flee so I fought and I pulled out my
absolute best jujitsu moves that idler
when I was younger it&#39;s called biting
somebody on the leg and that&#39;s what I
did
I grabbed this guy&#39;s leg and I bit him
on the inside of the thigh just as hard
as I could but he was wearing these big
baggy pants and all I got was fabric and
I cracked my front teeth and as I was
trying to bite him his friend just kept
kicking me in the head in the back
repeatedly until finally he said give me
your goddamn jacket and I threw my
jacket off rolled away and they took it
and took off well my friend Angela took
me to the hospital which was luckily
right across the street and I was
diagnosed with a concussion and a
bruised kidney and they gave me this
really powerful narcotic pain shot and
sent me home and I remember on the way
home thinking how strange everything
looked well the next day when I woke up
it was obvious the pain meds were not
the cause of what was making everything
look so strange when things moved they
moved in these bizarre stop-action
frames like individual discrete picture
frames with a line connecting them and
bright light seemed somehow amplified
and the jagged edges of these picture
frames made these beautiful and elegant
patterns as things moved and I was
absolutely entranced and mesmerised by
the fact that this must be how our brain
constructs a moving image just like a
video camera with individual discrete
pictures helped excuse me having a brain
injury sometimes causes memory issues
here there we go
well anyway our brains normally smooth
out these frames and I remember looking
at my hand and trying to draw what I saw
and I literally drew hundreds of
pictures and I just have a few of them
here for you today and I remember
looking at my hand and it was literally
like looking at it for the first time if
you look at it here may look smooth from
a distance but when you zoom in closer
you see that it&#39;s really not smooth it&#39;s
made from all of these tiny straight
lines and as it turns out there is
mathematics to describe this it&#39;s called
the polar integral but at the time all I
knew was that the smoothness or the
fluidity of motion was gone
and I would look at my hand and I would
move it back and forth faster and slower
and as I moved it faster the picture
frames were farther apart and as I moved
it slower the picture frames were closer
together and I wondered how could I not
have seen this before and then I thought
how can I effectively describe this to
somebody else and then the last question
I had was as do I dare even tell anybody
about this at all
well eventually obviously I tried I
started to talk about it and a good way
for me to explain it is to imagine
you&#39;re watching television and you know
how on television you can see frame by
frame by frame well the way I see is
like that only in real time and I
noticed it gave everything this slightly
pixelated or grid like quality well then
one day my little daughter Megan who was
born during my wild years she asked me
how the television worked
I said little rectangle pixels they
change color and as they change color
that changes the picture well right as I
said that a kershel came on with a big o
and you know how kids sometimes see
right to the core of a problem she said
dad that&#39;s impossible how do you make a
circle with rectangles and it was like a
door in my mind that I had never opened
opened up and I walked through it and
realized you can&#39;t you can make the
pixels half that size and half that size
all the way to infinity but the edge of
the circle will always be a zigzag even
though the resolution gets finer in
other words perfect circles literally
don&#39;t exist it was a day I will never
forget a moment that I realized that I
could understand things that I never
thought I could and more than anything I
wanted to share this but there was also
some serious negative side effects that
came with this I developed agoraphobia
OCD post-traumatic stress and I
literally locked myself away in my house
and would not leave unless I had to get
something absolutely essential I had
blankets covering the windows that not a
beam of light could get into the house
and this self-imposed isolation went on
for over three years until
one day I ran out of food and I actually
had to leave the house and so I went to
the mall and I had a sandwich and while
I was there I was drawing and I ran into
a physicist and we started talking and I
found that as we were talking we were
talking about similar things but just in
two different ways for instance what he
would talk about PI he would say things
like f of the X and big squeeze theorem
but when I talked about PI what I saw
was something similar to the pixel
analogy I saw a shape that was forever
getting smoother and smoother and
smoother as you sliced it into smaller
slices and it would forever approach a
circle but never reach it or when he
would talk about square roots or
exponents for instance eight to the
third power he could be talking about
eight times eight times 8 which is 512
but what I saw was literally a cube that
it was composed of smaller and smaller
cubes and this cube you can see it has
eight cubes on each side and you square
those 8 into 64 and you stack those 64
eight high and you get 512 so 8 to the
third power and this drawing are
literally one and the same thing or when
you would talk to me about fusion he
could be talking about things like this
where is what I talked about fusion and
what I saw was this a geometric timed
implosion that would get the atoms close
enough together so that they could fuse
well he gave me the best advice of my
life that day when he said maybe you
should go back to school and try to
learn traditional mathematics so you can
say this in a language that we all
understand and that&#39;s what I did
I went and I enrolled in math 99 algebra
1 at Tacoma Community College and I was
blown away the first day where my
teacher Tracey Haney graphed an equation
and I said you mean all these equations
can be grafted to a shape and she said
yes and I said Wow then we are talking
about the same thing but just in two
different ways and from that day I was
completely hooked I would find myself in
the math lab for hours and months at a
time trying to absorb all this
incredible beautiful knowledge that I
had completely ignored previously in my
life well then one day I was in the math
lab and a friend that I had talked to
came in all excited and he said they
were studying interference patterns and
when he showed me these a feather could
have knocked me over because the
interference patterns were identical to
many of my drawings here we have actual
interference patterns and a drawing of a
factor that I drew and it gave me this
great feeling that I was on the right
track I didn&#39;t want to be that crazy guy
who thought he saw a math everywhere but
really didn&#39;t and so it gave me this
feeling that yes I was on the right
track and and learning the right way
well then shortly after that I was in
the cafeteria at school sitting at a
table drawing and I ran into this
beautiful woman and as we started
talking I managed to get a conversation
going with her and I talked about
typical things that guys do like pie and
relativity and drawing and somehow
managed to get her interested in talking
to me and as we talked she said what a
lot of people had told me she said when
you show me the drawings and you say
this in laymen terms it makes the
concept really easy to understand and
she said I wish I would have learned it
that way before I took these math
classes so the concept would have been
embedded first well
that woman she inspired me to get out of
the house and try to change the world
and a positive and meaningful way and so
that is my mission to try to inspire
students to try to help create
scientists and that beautiful woman that
I met that day that inspired me to get
of the house she is now my wife and we
just had a beautiful baby girl and
because of them and because of this
attack and because of mathematics life
couldn&#39;t be any better thank you so much
