so you took my first line Tom um when
you think of landscape architecture you
probably think of gardening beautifully
manicured lawns and possibly an
encounter with an amazing city park
while this is certainly what landscape
architects do as we move forward it&#39;s
important that we consider not only how
landscapes look and how people use them
but also how they function as ecological
systems what this requires is for us to
build living infrastructures and we
begin to do this by making more
symbiotic boundaries between human
beings and natural systems we can think
of our current methods of environmental
construction as creating a prosthetic
when a human being loses a limb it looks
like the previous limb but the function
is minimal the ability to feel and react
are missing and possibly the fingers are
stiff environmental sensing computation
and robotics begin to change its
relationship and they allow us to
construct landscapes that are natural or
extra natural extensions of the
environments they occupy we can begin
this process in two ways the first is
how we visualize and understand
landscapes we do this with models
simulations and animations that give
built some data that give us a deeper
understanding of how lengths how
landscapes work this deeper level of
understanding allows us to make more
nuanced decisions when we when we
construct landscapes particularly in
terms of how they relate to the plants
and natural processes within that within
that space the second way computation
plays a role is through faster and more
holistic decision-making typically when
we observe landscapes we observe them
over years decades and centuries we then
make very large infrastructural moves
that are aimed to either counter or
promote a very specific behavior but
with current technologies way
particularly using environmental sensing
and monitoring we
able to make decisions about landscapes
very quickly to alter the Ecology&#39;s in
very small ways and nudge them in very
specific directions using this
methodology we&#39;re developing prototypes
that begin to modify Ecology&#39;s institute
such as robots that traverse the bayous
searching for detrimental processes that
cause the absence of oxygen in the water
column a phenomenon known as hypoxia
when these robots sequester this oxygen
robbing process they remove it from the
ecological system and by responding to
the this process specifically they ask
this agents within that system we can we
can look at many of our cities today and
we understand that they&#39;re built in
opposition to the landscapes they occupy
we make concessions for the environment
but we rarely create behaviors that are
in tune with the plants and animal
species within those environments it is
possible though for us to begin building
much more responsive landscapes this
prototype of a spillway basically
splices the levee it takes the sediment
Laden waters pouring down the river and
functions much like the printhead on an
inkjet printer using this process we use
the power of the river and by monitoring
downstream we&#39;re able to build an
autonomous set of logics into the fill
way gates that open and close the gates
to divert water to either cut or build
land by building models and simulations
of this process we&#39;re able to use this
to build scaffoldings for future
Ecology&#39;s that may grow in these
landscapes while also looking at
recorded histories and future
projections that might allow those those
landscapes to form so that they protect
cities from future severe weather events
these landscapes become dynamic and
they&#39;re built from the processes of the
Bayou but they are curated directly from
the behaviors of the spillways so we&#39;re
using computation to imagine new
landscapes not new landscape form but
new processes that build a whole range
of new landscape types we imagine these
landscapes as ecologically fit places
but they may be like nothing we&#39;ve ever
seen before they&#39;re performing as well
as a natural ecology but they&#39;re built
from processes that we design so taking
this into consideration environmental
sensing computation and real products
become a new toolkit for landscape
architects ideally enabling us to design
with a much more environmentally or
excuse me a holistic environmental ethos
thank you can you bring my mic up thank
you at first of all let me apologize for
being such a dick it was an accident
here&#39;s the good news is editing it&#39;s
really great so I&#39;ll disappear and you
remain triumphant so a question how new
is this that&#39;s pretty sophisticated
looking stuff and I haven&#39;t really ever
seen it before which is why we picked
you sonu how novel this is and how did
it where did it kind of start well I
mean um I think I&#39;m anomaly in landscape
architecture this idea that I&#39;m have
this kind of belief that we are
manipulating these systems kind of this
level of degree i think is one that&#39;s
that&#39;s a new idea i guess in my approach
i&#39;m thinking that we&#39;re doing this
anyway is kind of by accident and that
we need to be kind of more active agents
in that process and take ownership of
this so i think it&#39;s i mean there&#39;s very
few my other landscape architects that i
know of that are doing what I&#39;m doing
which is what I suspected it&#39;s a thing
but pretty much your thing maybe perhaps
it&#39;ll be more of a thing for other
people after they see this talk one
other quick question and that is you
alluded to in your talk the fact that
you may have technologies with the the
prototype solenoid sort of slurry
dispersing things that you made to sort
of print land and you know I&#39;ve told you
this a million times that my ears really
perked up when you said print land what
that&#39;s a pretty radical idea can you
just quickly explain what that means um
well I mean it&#39;s basically
because we&#39;re not directly or explicitly
printing exactly the forms we want but
we&#39;re trying to take into account a
whole range of factors so these are kind
of a multiple set of goals and by simply
diverting water and very specific ways
based on the kind of recorded set of
history&#39;s you&#39;ve seen of how this
behaves were able to innocence guide you
know massive amounts of sediment in very
specific directions and then I mean I
mean it&#39;s basically what what it says it
is it&#39;s printing where we want want the
land to be and we&#39;re very very kind of
tight accuracy close to the gates and
much kind of much more fuzzy accuracy as
we move away from them great and if
anyone has a backyard that they want to
improve with totally roses look unplug
the guys no thanks so much they raise
your say
