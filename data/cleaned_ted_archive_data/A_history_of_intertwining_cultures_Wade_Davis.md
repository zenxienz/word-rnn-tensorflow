I I didn&#39;t actually shoot that footage
my good friend Trevor frosted it was
sort of a home movie for us and there
were a few technical glitches I&#39;m sorry
but all those images were taken within
20 miles of our home in northern British
Columbia and it&#39;s my n viewable task to
welcome you to my city to my country to
this wonderful place of British Columbia
and just as landscape holds the key to
character culture Springs from a spirit
of place Margaret Atwood said that if
you wanted to distill the essence of
Britain the United States and Canada you
only need to know three words Island
frontier and for Canada survival because
it is really the weight of the north
that hovers in the Canadian imagination
and defines the essence of our national
soul and that&#39;s why the most perfect
expression of our muted patriotism is a
line of verse from a poet Juvenal who
wrote more penis pump a silly there my
country is not a country it&#39;s the winter
and when the Great British travel writer
Jan Morris came to Vancouver she
reported that in Vancouver you could
drown in niceness and what had happened
is she had bumped into somebody in the
street who who had suddenly turned
around and said to her I&#39;m sorry but
what Jan didn&#39;t understand is the phrase
in Canada I&#39;m sorry is not an apology
it&#39;s a mantra and it&#39;s actually a way of
saying look you and I live in this
impossible country where for much of our
history we had more Lakes than people
where you could turn the continental
United States on its side plunk it in
the Canada and still have 1500 miles of
country running away to the polls and
you didn&#39;t want to hit me I certainly
didn&#39;t want to be hit by you we live in
a civil society I need you as much as
you need me
and so I&#39;m sorry
which we are we are we live in a realm
of multiple histories multiple paths for
250 years our entire economy was
mercantile it was based on the fur trade
our rivers and lakes were our highways
we traveled by canoe we were not
settlers and so we encountered the first
nations of the land we needed them and
so not only did we not make war on the
first peoples we very often married them
and in marrying them we moved up in the
world so we live as Canadians on the
edge of the wild when you look across
this harbour you&#39;ll see mountains all
those mountains have streams were salmon
spawn and bears come out of the hills to
feast upon them and those very mountains
go a thousand miles up the coast to the
Yukon and so if you ever asked what is
the difference between an American and a
Canadian I think the simple answer is
Americans look West for heroes but
Canadians look north thank you very much
[Applause]
