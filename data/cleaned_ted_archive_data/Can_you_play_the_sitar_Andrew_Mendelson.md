the first time I heard the sitar it
changed my life forever I was a freshman
at Southwestern University a small
school right smack in the middle of
Texas I was so captivated by the sound
of the instruments so intrigued by its
beauty that I dedicated the next 22
years of my life to learning and playing
it you might even call me a sitar
evangelist and why not I mean look at
the thing it&#39;s beautiful and the range
of the instrument I mean it can go from
calm soothing meditation to full-on
face-melting licks at 400 beats per
minute that could only be described as
straight-up super shreddy now the sitar
is from India and it&#39;s used to play
Hindustani music the classical music of
northern India now I use air quotes
around the word classical because unlike
western classical music Hindustani music
is not set in stone it&#39;s not based on
compositions that are hundreds of years
old
this is improvisational music Hindustani
music is based on raagas and raagas are
like melodic themes that you improvise
off of the raga sets the scale the mood
the vibe if you will and the musician is
then free to explore musical ideas
within that structure and there raagas
for everything for every emotion you can
think of for every season of the year
even for every time of day if you want
to build a fire there&#39;s a raga for that
if you want to make it rain and put your
fire out there&#39;s a raga for that and
because this is improvisational music
it&#39;s changing in real time such that no
two performances even of the same raga
are ever alike this is music that&#39;s
truly of and for the present moment
now you might take a look at the sitar
and think whoa that is an ancient
instrument but compared to the violin
for example which took shape some 480
some odd years ago and changed very
little since the sitar is downright
contemporary sitars didn&#39;t even appear
until after the moe
period right at the end of the 18th
century and early sitars looked very
little like their modern-day
counterparts and they&#39;ve gone through
countless transformations over the years
it&#39;s most recent incarnation occurred
only in the 1940s at that time two young
maestro&#39;s pundit Ravi Shankar and who
stood Valaya Khan each set out to design
their own version of the sitar to suit
their unique styles of playing I never
since then pretty much every sitar that
you see today is based primarily on one
of these two designs the other thing
that Ravi Shankar and Valaya Kahn did
was they took those sitars with them
outside of India and inspired countless
musicians scattered across the globe to
pick up a sitar and give it a try
now the sitar is a temperamental Beast
its delicate body made of wood and
gourds creaks and warps at the slightest
change of temperature and humidity its
tuning pegs all 20 of them held in place
with nothing more than friction in a
prayer violently pop out of tune at the
faintest breeze the bridge wears itself
down in a matter of weeks transforming
your sweet sitar sound into a buzzy
dissonant mess and God forbid anything
should break on the instrument
you see sitars are handmade out of
materials of varying proportion so each
piece of the sitar is custom fitted to
that particular instrument and if any of
those parts break well you need a
skilled craftsmen to be able to repair
it and of course all those skilled
craftsmen live in India so if anything
goes wrong in any other part of the
world well as they say in Texas it&#39;s
enough to make an armadillo cry well
having dealt with these issues for the
past couple decades I&#39;ve come to realize
modern technology could go a long way
towards improving the instrument so I&#39;ve
designed my own take on the sitar using
composite materials
standardized dimensions and adjustable
replaceable components it&#39;s a sitar that
can be played and maintained by anyone
anywhere
using carbon fiber for the body a
material that&#39;s proven itself in cellos
and violins for years the sitar can now
be lighter smaller and more durable
while sounding just as good if not
better than traditional instruments by
using modern day machine tuners the
strings can be more easily and more
accurately tuned and better yet they&#39;ll
stay in tune and by standardizing the
dimensions parts can now be swapped out
and easily replaced if ever they fail
and these are just a few of the many
innovations I&#39;ve included in this new
design you see Hindustani music is music
of the present moment so it demands
instruments that are at the cutting edge
it&#39;s my hope that by designing an
instrument that&#39;s easier to maintain
sounds great and is more durable it&#39;ll
encourage a new generation to pick up
the sitar and explore the rich tradition
of Hindustani music and keep on
shredding into the 21st century thank
you
