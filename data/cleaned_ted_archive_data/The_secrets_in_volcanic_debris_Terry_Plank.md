so I study volcanoes because we still
don&#39;t understand why some are more
explosive than others why do some booze
on the ground the magma and others the
magma explodes into the sky for some
it&#39;s a it&#39;s a tourist attraction for
others they&#39;re killers like the 30,000
people who died in a matter of minutes
in a single eruption in the Caribbean
what makes the difference between an
explosive eruption or fizzle now
contrary to what you might think the
right approach here is not to go dashing
headlong into a volcano while its rear
up ting that&#39;s super dangerous I don&#39;t
do that I have a 12 year old kid what
most of us do instead is wait until the
eruptions over and go out to the scene
of the crime because the volcanic debris
has chemical clues that tell us what
happened deep in the earth before the
eruption started literally a couple days
ago last week I was up in the high
desert of Arizona I was looking at some
volcanic debris like this to use lava
flows that are cascading down into the
Grand Canyon Vulcans throne and if the
federal government hadn&#39;t been shut the
night before I would have been telling
you fantastic stories about clinging to
the walls at the Grand Canyon looking at
these lava flows fortunately there are
another 200 volcanic vents that are just
outside the national park boundary that
we had access to and this is a great
place to do our detective work because
lying around on the ground is all the
frozen lava that we can bring back and
do forensics with in our lab we can zap
them with lasers and ion beams to find
out how hot the magma is and how much
water it contained in it before it
erupted yes it&#39;s the water which we
usually think of as the benign
life-giving substance that in this case
as gas is the explosive fuel so for that
reason the perfect model for an eruption
is a Seltzer bottle and I&#39;m going to
take the cap off the bottle and release
the pressure of shaken Lotus
not supposed to get the equipment and
make an eruption the co2 in the in the
bottle came out as gas in lavas the gas
is water but the process is very similar
and what the Seltzer bottle might teach
us is that maybe just the amount of gas
before the eruption which is drive
something more explosive and while
that&#39;s a simple idea it&#39;s actually a
very difficult test because how do we
know how much co2 is in the bottle
before we open the cap it&#39;s gone it goes
what&#39;s there left to measure so what we
need is a little capsule that goes into
liquid and protects it when we open the
cap unfortunately magmas have these
little pressure vessels within them they
have little crystals that are
encapsulated by mistake some of the
magma it&#39;s just an accident and then
when the crippled erupts and cools the
little magnet inside the crystal freezes
into a glass it still has the water
dissolved in it where we can measure it
and this approach has led to a whole
decade of volcano science to study how
much water is in volcanoes before they
erupted my students and I when I was at
Boston University amount Columbia we&#39;ve
been fanning out around the ring of fire
in the Pacific we&#39;ve gone to some pretty
far flung places like the Tonga islands
in the southwest Pacific where there&#39;s
still a king and the marianas islands in
the western Pacific next to the deepest
place of the ocean and the Aleutian
Islands out in the western part of
Alaska where you can only get there by
hitchhiking on a boat and even in
Nicaragua where they have a sport called
a volcano boarding i&#39;ll let you guess
what that is so what have we found out
you can just look at this picture and
see for yourself as you go from left to
right across this diagram the volcanic
magnitude increases by a factor of a
thousand and the water contents of the
magma only increase a little bit the
water almost uniform in fact the 60
volcanoes we&#39;ve looked at they all have
between three and five percent water an
average at four they&#39;re nearly uniform
it&#39;s almost like there&#39;s a magic number
like 42 but in this case for for the
answer of magma in the universe and
while this is a pretty cool discovery
and it&#39;s telling us about something it&#39;s
not helping us with the explicit
he questioned all the volcanoes seem to
have the same water so what is it we
have to go back to the drawing board and
the drawing board is a Seltzer bottle
and you already know the answer to this
if I were to take the bottle and hand it
to you and say okay don&#39;t let it explode
in your face what would you do you think
you know what you do is don&#39;t open it
smart no you have to open it what do you
do you just crack it right you just
crack it open so there&#39;s clearly a rate
term in this there&#39;s a speed to it and
maybe that&#39;s the same for magmas how
fast they move might be as important as
how much water they have in them so
that&#39;s our next ten years of work is
looking at these crystals again as
stopwatches to see how fast magma moves
from high pressure to low pressure in
the earth and so far we found it can
move at miles per hour before the
eruption literally a freight train
heading to the surface and exploding so
we&#39;re fanning out around again in the
world to look for the fastest magma on
earth because the hope and all of this
is that we could hear it coming magma
doesn&#39;t move quietly it makes noises it
makes little earthquakes just like the
self your bottle when we crack it you
can hear it hiss maybe the hist makes
you nervous because you know an eruption
is happening but that this is small and
if it&#39;s widely spaced then we may be
confident that it&#39;s going to be a small
eruption but there&#39;s a real concern that
this can happen faster than then we can
respond in the time that it&#39;s taken for
me to give this talk which is just a
back exactly 6 minutes magma can move
the fastest mag Wanderers can move miles
and that&#39;s plenty fast to go from the
magma chamber to the surface but it&#39;s
not very much time for us to blow the
whistle and get people out of harm&#39;s way
so volcano monitoring is important but
it&#39;s not enough what we need to do is
understand ahead of time what a volcano
has dished out in the past so that we
can understand and prepare ourselves for
the future thank you
