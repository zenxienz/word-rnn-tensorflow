most of us like to drink coffee we do it
every day sometimes three or four times
a day but most of us are not aware that
every time we make a cup of coffee made
from one capsule no sugar no milk added
we use 14 liters of water 14 that is 56
times more than the amount we drink at
the end not so efficient most of the
water is invested in growing the coffee
beans which usually happens far away
from where we drink the coffee at the
end another 20% is used for making the
coffee at the Machine and cleaning and
washing it afterwards water drought is a
global problem in Italy they now shut
off water in Rome for up to eight hours
a day in the summer in California they
dry up gardens in India 50% of the land
is already under extreme water stress
Spain is now importing water from France
in many regions we basically cannot
trust nature any more we don&#39;t expect
the rain to come and we start producing
water using different technologies
desalination for example water is used
in everything we consume in life some of
it is direct we see it coming out of the
tap we pay the bill for it usually but
most of it is the unseen water it&#39;s the
virtual water invested in producing and
moving products and services around the
world
so our consumption culture directly
effect
affect the water situation in many
different countries but let&#39;s go back to
our coffee now I would like to make it a
latte milk is very water intensive we
need to grow the cows we need to grow
the food for the cows we need to produce
the milk and then we need to distribute
it all around so for every 100
milliliters of milk I will add to my
coffee we will use up to 100 litres of
water if I am vegan a bit better
only 25 litres but adding that to the 14
litres I mentioned before and we already
get to a big number so should we all
keep having 3 letters a day what about
food we grow food with water and then we
eat it make sense tomatoes for example
the French people love Tomatoes usually
they grow it locally in France but
offseason when they can&#39;t grow it they
import it mainly from Morocco now
growing tomatoes in Morocco is much more
water intensive than doing it locally in
France but the French people want their
fresh tomatoes on the table all year
round so we will pay the price of 30
liters of water per one kilo of tomatoes
meat is much worse for everyone kilo of
beef meat on our table we will use up to
15,000 liters of water and if we like it
to be a lamb steak it&#39;s almost 60
thousands liters of water per one kilo
on our table alarming numbers what about
clothes we need to wear something not
fancy a pair of jeans for example a 501
Levi&#39;s jeans will consume up to 4
and liters of water across its life now
ladies they don&#39;t like to drink water
but the cotton the jeans is made from
loves water so up to 70% of the water
will go into growing the cotton and
making it a fiber another about 25% will
go into laundry now we the people affect
that stage by choosing the laundry
machine the cleaning materials and most
importantly the frequency will choose to
wash our clothes so should we all keep
buying new clothes every few months with
all of those flying numbers let&#39;s put it
in perspective the overall direct water
consumption coming from the top ranges
around the world between 20 liters per
person per day in some of the countries
in Africa all the way up to 6 to 600
liters of water in the US two buckets
almost 60 buckets now this is still the
direct water once we try to estimate the
real consumption the one that includes
the virtual water we get to thousands of
liters per person per day those numbers
largely depend on where we live what is
our consumption culture and where the
things we consume are coming from so
what is in this water that we all
consume besides the h2o molecules and
the chlorine taste in Israel for example
in every glass of water glass of
drinking water we will invest 5 mega
Joule of energy this is the amount of
energy enough to charge an iPhone for
more than a year we also along the
process produced 270 grams
of solid waste this amount equal to the
weight of two new iPhone 7 so it&#39;s not
just about the amount of water we
consume it&#39;s also about other the
natural resources we consume when we
produce and use the water those natural
resources are coming with environmental
price tag desalination requires energy
pumping requires energy producing energy
emits greenhouse gas emissions which
result in global warming everything is
connected in Israel in our particular
water system 66 percent of the
greenhouse gas emissions resulted from
the water system are coming from the
desalination stage another about 20
percent is coming from moving the water
around the country but water systems are
different in different countries it
depends on the technologies on the
structure of the system on the distances
the water quality in Israel Denmark or
Italy when we will use the same amount
of water it will result in different
amount of greenhouse gas emissions
resulted of the system but at the same
time Israel although I own its
greenhouse gas emissions of the water
system also recycle more than 80 percent
of the water by large the leading
country in that so there are different
trade-offs to consider when we try to
evaluate different water systems and
their environmental impacts now don&#39;t
get me wrong I&#39;m not against drinking
coffee or buying new clothes every once
in a while we need to drink we need to
eat
we need to wear something but the water
crisis water drought is already globally
affecting us we are not even sure if we
will have enough water to sustain
humanity in the future so this make me
wonder can we do something better with
our fresh water does it make sense to
keep drinking so much coffee when we
shut water in cities does it make sense
to keep wearing clothes for materials
that requires so much water to grow
is it even ethical to use so much water
where 10 tenth of the world does not
have access to safe drinking water I
leave the stage today raising more
questions than giving answers but what I
show today is actually true for many
different natural resources not just
water virtual resources are used in
everything we consume from production to
moving it to consuming it to dumping it
so next time when we consume something
let&#39;s stop and think about it do we
really need it and if the answer is
still yes are we wearing the frame the
price for society thank you
