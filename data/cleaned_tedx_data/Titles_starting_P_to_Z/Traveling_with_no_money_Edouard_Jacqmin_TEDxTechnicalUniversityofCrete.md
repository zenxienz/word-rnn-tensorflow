1,000 kilometers 21 days 5 different
countries and six different cities 0
euros
my name is Edwards and in June 2016
I travelled for 21 days with absolutely
no money so from Germany to Hungary here
was the challenge to travel with no
money I emptied my wallet before leaving
home and I hit the roads and to toughen
up the challenge a bit I committed to
not use internet so I couldn&#39;t use
website like out surfing el Peaks or
other similar websites that allows you
to find accommodation or hosts for free
and like this began one of the most
incredible experiences I&#39;ve ever lived
in my life
[Music]
when I came back home everybody asked me
the same question how how did you do
that how did you survive for 21 days
with absolutely no money
I can&#39;t even survive for one day with no
money I have to eat I have to sleep
somewhere well here is the secrets when
you travel you&#39;re basically on the air
three things to pay the first thing is
transportation getting from point A to
point B the second thing is food what
are you going to eat what are you going
to drink and the last thing is
accommodation where are you going to
sleep and you can make these three
things free and here is all for
transportation IH hiked the old trip
I&#39;ve been picked up by cars trucks vans
well that was an event actually that was
a hearse you know the kind of vehicle
that transport dead people so this
hearse was transporting a dead from
Leipzig to Dresden and let&#39;s just say I
had the privilege to be part of the
wonderful journey I even got a ride from
a smart car that was driving 150
kilometers an hour on the highway in
Germany I have to say I didn&#39;t even know
such a small car could drive that fast
and I have to say I was a bit scared the
foods
I was asking local restaurants for
leftovers so I would just ran into a
restaurant and say hey my name is Edward
33 years old I&#39;m doing a travel
experiment I try to travel with no money
so if you have anything that is not good
anymore that you plan to throw that you
plan to do you want to use you won&#39;t
sell and you would like to give it to me
I&#39;ll be happy as expected
most people told me no but sometimes I
received bread and to be honest that&#39;s
sometimes the only thing I ate during
the day during three days actually I
only ate bread and water but as you can
see I was happy but
times people would cook real meal for me
from scratch or give me delicious dishes
this is our I had pizza Thai kebabs
chocolate cake with cappuccino got our
dauphinois in dresden that chocolate
cake and that macaroon had the number
one cake shop according to Trip Advisor
in Budapest and that little soup and
that reduced in the number one
restaurant according to Trip Advisor
again in Vienna and a quick one about
that restaurants when I wanted to sit
down the waiter even pulled out my share
so that I could sit down I mean nobody
has ever done that to me before in my
life
for accommodation now as I told you I
couldn&#39;t use couchsurfing that was part
of the challenge so same as for the food
I would just run into a complete
stranger in the street and say hey can I
sleep at your place tonight
as expected people told me no a lot of
times actually nine out of ten times
people told me no but I&#39;ve learned
something from that while I&#39;ve learned
is to redefine my view about rejection
now we all face rejections in our daily
lives we go to a job interview we don&#39;t
get the job we get rejected we go talk
to that pretty girl in a bar we get
rejected the thing is most of us
experience rejections once a day once a
week sometimes even once a month we&#39;re
not so used to it and that&#39;s why it
hurts so much but there are two things
that I&#39;d like to share with you about
rejection and that comes from a guy who
has experienced an average of 20
rejections a day between the rejections
I faced when I was hitchhiking asking
for food or asking for accommodation the
first thing is that people are never
rejecting you people are rejecting the
idea you represent so never take it
personally when you are hiking for
example who has average hiked in his
life auto stop what alright cool group
guys
when you are each hiking the vast
majority of people who won&#39;t stick you
each hiking won&#39;t do it simply because
that&#39;s who they are
they don&#39;t take each hikers end of the
story don&#39;t take it personally and the
second thing about rejection is that
rejection does not mean you won&#39;t have
anything at all
rejection just means you&#39;ll have
something a little bit different when I
was asking random people in the street
hey can I sleep at your place tonight
and people would tell me no I wasn&#39;t
telling myself all right that means I&#39;m
going to have to sleep outside tonight
no I was telling myself all right
that means I&#39;m going to find somebody
else and live another experience that
might be even better than the one I just
missed I believe we should never be
afraid of rejection because it is just
part of life and to me getting what you
want in life is just a matter of being
willing to experience enough rejection
before having what you actually want in
the end I didn&#39;t sleep a single night
outside it did happens that at 4 a.m. I
was still in the streets looking for
somebody but I always found someone now
what are the lessons that I&#39;ve learned
from doing that from doing this trip
already shared some of them with you but
I&#39;d like now to share with you the four
biggest ones I&#39;ve learned and I believe
these are lessons we can all apply in
our daily lives because in the end life
is a journey - the first thing I&#39;ve
learned is that this is not about what
you get this is about what you give I
began this journey asking myself every
time I was meeting someone new what can
I get from this person can I get food
can I get a ride can I get an
accommodation and I ended up this
journey asking myself questions that
were completely different questions like
what can I give to this person can I
give a smile my enthusiasm an inspiring
story to share
an ear to listen to problems sing a song
dance with them anything and switching
these questions from the getting to the
giving completely changed my journey and
I have to say that I lived the best
moments of my journey when I was in the
giving mindset and not in the getting
mindset but to give you have to meet
people and that&#39;s the second thing I&#39;ve
learned drop the field to approach
people and the world can be an amazing
place traveling with no money forces you
to constantly meet new people because
your survival depends on them in our
daily lives we sometimes even struggle
for - when we have to ask away
when we are lost it is just so easy to
take our smartphones and I&#39;ll ask Google
Maps we are not so used anymore to start
a conversation with a complete stranger
and build a relationship out of nothing
this journey taught me to drop my fear
of the other and I&#39;ve learned that you
don&#39;t need a good reason to start a
conversation you don&#39;t need to be in the
same sports club you don&#39;t need to be in
the same university or introduced by
your common friends there to say hello
to a complete stranger there to just run
in a bar and say to the first stranger
hey I just met you this is crazy
now there to say hey I saw you I fell
you a cool my name is Edward don&#39;t say
your name is Edgar it unless your name
is Edward but dare to say it this guy
and his friends they were carrying a
couch around vienna at each famous stops
seven of them they had to lay on the
couch and just enjoy life when I saw
them I had to introduce myself so I told
them hey you guys are amazing and they
looked at me and they told me you want
to come with us and this is how I ended
up spending the old afternoon with two
guys from Vienna just carrying a couch
around Vienna
the third thing I learned is that
sometimes not eating the choice is the
best option you can have when you travel
with money you can basically pick
anything you want the food you&#39;re gonna
eat the transportation you&#39;re gonna take
the Eurostar where you&#39;re gonna stay at
anything but when you decide to travel
with no money you just don&#39;t have that
luxury of choice anymore
so when someone gives you something you
have to accept it when you are rich
hiking for example and someone stops his
car the car looks a bit dirty the driver
doesn&#39;t seem to speak the language you
are speaking you can&#39;t just say hey
thank you bet I&#39;ll just wait for another
car you can say that because the person
gives you chance so you have to give
them a chance and this is how I ended up
spending two hours in the truck of a
Ukrainian truck driver that this does
make any languages I was speaking during
two hours he kept telling me stories in
Ukrainian I don&#39;t speak Ukrainian and
every ten minutes I had to reply him
with the broad smile on my face yeah you
get that I don&#39;t understand a single
word of what you&#39;re saying don&#39;t you but
you know what that was one of the most
incredible and funniest experience of my
journey because you see I am not so sure
that if I would have met this guy in the
bar in my own town I would have spent
two hours talking with him especially
not in ukrainian but here 1,000
kilometers away from home with no money
I had no choice and sometimes not having
the choice is the best option you can
have and the last thing I&#39;ve learned is
that there are no such things as bad
experiences to me there are only
experiences that lead you to better
things
but I believe we should never regret
anything because the bad things that
happen to us make us grow and ultimately
lead us to better things I think it was
the second night of my trip I was in
Leipzig eastern Germany and I began

around 8:00 p.m.
asking random people in the street hey
can I sleep at your place tonight and
four hours later and twenty rejections
later I found myself in Leipzig still in
Midnight&#39;s complete darkness with still
nobody to host me and I began asking
myself questions questions like why am I
doing this why am I putting myself into
such conditions by the experience
rejections and so so much bad things but
then I met these four German girls and
they accepted to host me and they told
me first we go to a nightclub and you
are coming with us I was so happy and at
some point of the night one of them
asked me Edward what&#39;s the worst thing
about travelling the way you do and I
thought about it and I replied well you
know nothing because you see tonight
I&#39;ve experienced more than 20 rejections
during four hours I felt really bad but
all these little rejections and bad
things leads me at the right time at the
right place
why cross your path and going to a
nightclub with you is not something I&#39;m
going to forget for a very long time so
I don&#39;t regret anything and that&#39;s
basically the story of my journey how
all these little rejections and bad
things that happen to me let me to meet
the people who made my journey and to
live moments I will remember as long as
I live
as a closing am i trying to sell you
something am I suggesting that you
should just leave your wallet and all
your money at home and start travelling
the way I did of course not
if it&#39;s not your thing don&#39;t do it but
all I want to say is they&#39;re a bit more
a little bit of courage can change your
life it changed mine ask yourself the
question what would I do if I wear a
complete
if fearless go talk to that stranger
dare to face rejection go on an
adventure because in the end like Alan
Keller once said life is either a daring
adventure or nothing at all thank you
very much
