recognize what you just witnessed yes
that&#39;s the art of ventriloquism the art
that more than half of the world fails
to pronounce rightly the art that
everyone appreciate but where if you
understand it&#39;s the ability to speak
without moving your lips
what Silla prism is Greek and Latin to
most of the people should it be because
it&#39;s derived from Latin wet dream means
belly and low quest means one who speaks
how that me tell you how I came into it
as a kid I was an insistent check the
box
I used to bug my dad with hundreds of
questions one day he was so irritated
with me he asked me to shut my mouth and
as an obedient kid I did shut my mouth
but continued speaking that is how I
became a little awkward let me start
from the beginning my earliest memory
was being Restless by restlessness I do
not mean being agitated or anxious
I mean being active in fact hyperactive
I used to pinch the neighbor&#39;s kid I
used to say topple the table quite often
for fun I used to pull the cat&#39;s tail I
used to do all sorts of weird things in
other words I was a normal kid somehow
this restlessness ingrained in me
developed into a major words you now let
me reveal a secret about myself throw us
Kari looking insect at me mind you I&#39;ll
not be scared at all but throw an
algebra problem at me I&#39;ll be scared to
death
algebra makes me Restless
what day I said ruminating about signing
off from sine theta causes for avoiding
cos theta down at the beach instead of
tan theta when a magician entered my
house
he showed me various magic tricks
including mathematics puzzles and coil
tricks I was so fascinated by the art of
magic
I immediately caught the bug of magic it
took me some minutes to unravel the
secret but this opened the portals of
magic to me the first person to realize
that I was a magician was my dad but I
don&#39;t think he was very proud about it
he realized that the coins and notes
from his pocket we&#39;re vanishing but dad
then stopped me you can&#39;t tame the
spirit of someone who has magic in their
wings and you well my dad could he hit
me along with that reality also hit me
I realized mathematics was not my cup of
tea but magic was I immediately break
magic I started pursuing and performing
hundreds of shows but one day I was
bored of magic and I became Restless let
me show you instances where restlessness
has produced wonder the great scientist
Archimedes could have continued with his
pleasant bath but no he became Restless
he became Restless about the loss of
water no not the loss of water due to
leaky Tufts but the loss above spilt
water and the law of buoyancy was for
take another example of Isaac Newton if
an apple were to fall on my head at best
I would have eaten the Apple and gone
back to sleep but no he became Restless
he questioned and the gravitational law
came into existence
sheltered not the dawn of Canada films
and theater always used to say be
restless to achieve more
he also said work hard when you&#39;re alive
you can always go back to sleep of the
Dead coming back to my story I had
become a magician by now and I started
attending Lord of magic conventions in
one of the magic convention I found a
feather puppet a monkey or the one in
red is me yeah I found this monkey and I
was immediately attracted to the monkey
I wanted to learn ventriloquism intently
at least idea of mental or prison but
with great enthusiasm I approached a
ventriloquist but he blatantly refused
to teach me he said girls cannot become
ventriloquist&#39;s because you can&#39;t take
out the second voice or you can&#39;t
sustain the voice for long and that&#39;s
the reason why you don&#39;t have female
ventriloquist in the country
who&#39;ll fellow did not realize that most
of the voices coming out of husbands
belong to their wives
[Applause]
be that as it may I came back home
dejected and narrated this incident to
my mother she told me a beautiful story
once a shoe company sent it salesman to
an island of tribal on reaching the
island
the salesman wrote back saying that
please do not sign any shoes the tribe
is over here do not wear any footwear
and I will not be able to sell even a
single shoe in due course another
salesman came back to the same Island
but his views were diametrically
different he said then shiploads of
shoes
none of the tribals over here wear any
Footwear and this is the best place to
sell all of footwear the first world saw
the closed door while the second one
so a beautiful opening now my dear child
be like the second salesman look at the
beautiful opening before you grab this
opportunity and practice till you
achieve it I said but don&#39;t you think I
need a guru to learn the not like when
Trillo Quizzle she said books and
mirrors are the best features for any
artist yes it was difficult in a in an
era where there was no internet no
Google and no guru at hand I started
collecting books and tested about 20
lakhs easily I was learning a complete
visual media like went with autism
through an audio medium it was more or
less like learning swimming through
distant education it was very difficult
technically when chillip ism is all
about positioning your tongue at various
places of the palate in order to bring
out the voice the sounds like B v MP
the bilabial initially I failed
miserably I was not able to convince my
audience I was not able to convince
myself in fact I tried the pout
I tried half-open mouth I tried the
first thing of lips look how the sounds
I emitted they&#39;re not good they&#39;re not
sounding great but as they say practice
makes you perfect I practiced I never
let it go
they say persevere in space and it fade
rich dividends to my guru the mirror
helped me a lot believe me mirror is the
harshest gurus of all it shows all your
mistakes right in the face
with relentless guru and the father in
my belly
it&#39;s not a fire in your belly it&#39;s
because of fiber acidity
do you even know that I&#39;m in the middle
of setup or yes please go away okay got
you later Bob Ari sorry please ignore my
inner voice yeah
but large surf shows with each and every
performance I started gaining a lot of
confidence I became more and more
confident and I was ready for greater
challenges and this failed it for my
vinco thanku is my personal such
internal car if such an has called one
hundred hundreds then who has performed
an hundred different guises thank who is
a dummy define my personality as a
ventriloquist I was very happy about my
personality hundreds of shows ensued
over a period of time I was bored about
my personality and here is what happened
this is click personality
I mean ambidextrous in my ventriloquism
for performing to dummies
you need to compartmentalize your brain
into three parts we are three offers all
of us have different personalities the
dummy will not be handled in a
symmetrical manner it&#39;s completely
different over a period of time I became
so used to it it was very easy for me to
perform to dummies and then this is what
I did this is multiple personality
disorder yeah the picture reinforces the
statement so this I added the third guy
the monkey but this I need to operate
with my legs my legs will handle this
coming so my entire body needs to
coordinate but I wanted to challenge
myself again
I became Restless I was bored of doing
the same thing and here is what I did
the for dummy act let me show you the
video the glimpse of what for dummies
look yes it what would you have oh Joe
tomorrow Vic with talent is it by first
canary ha ha ha my exit punch our zone
could shuffle constructive you will be
for a fight
Vina bucoli ready to go chica chica
chica make this faster
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you to perform this particular act
my entire body is working my brain needs
to think in terms of layers my eyes need
to observe my nose takes a deep breath
for all five offers five different
characters and my vocal cords shift and
switch between the voices my hands work
on different levers each dummy on either
sides would have liveries for their bro
his eyebrows and eyeball Moomins and
then Joe humans and the head woman&#39;s and
each guys have different voices and the
guys towards the end are operated with
my legs that is I&#39;ll have 4 petals 2 for
each leg no goofing up with the voices
no goofing up the dialogues right kind
of voice right hello dialogues I need to
remember that my dialogues I need to
give write dialogue to the right guy and
handle the right lever to perform this
particular act I need to do
32 actions in fermentations and
combinations
and everything done mechanically no
remotes used at all and if you think
this is the wit the French love is in
this the Hydra ventriloquism does the
tallest talking ventriloquist puppet to
throw my voice to that level it cheers
my vocal cords but as dr. Abdul kalaam
says to shine like Sun you&#39;ll have to
burn like Sun first now my dear friends
I would like to reiterate restlessness
doesn&#39;t confine to particular art form
or performing arts you may be an
engineer you may be a student you may be
a technical person whoever you are
always keep this restlessness in you
alive it will propel you to greater
heights now I would like to conclude now
let me conclude oops
I&#39;m so sorry I&#39;ve got my granny would
you like to meet her
