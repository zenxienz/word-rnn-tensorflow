I&#39;m king of the world and you all have
to do whatever I say my apologies I
forgot I took my VR headset off
hahahahaha I&#39;m a pretty big nerd and I
absolutely love video games I&#39;ve spent
quite a lot of time my life playing them
lately with my new VR headset ever since
I received my Gamecube is a present for
my mother when I was just 7 years old
I&#39;ve grown to adore video games and
Technology spend hours diving into the
world of gaming and absolutely nothing
could capture my interest in the same
way however as I grew older I needed
more than to be entertained
I needed an escape as I entered middle
school my parents relationship began to
fall apart I would constantly hear my
father yelling cursing and abusing my
mother I would lie awake at night trying
to fall asleep to the sound of my own
parents divorce I started performing
poorly in school stopped caring about
everything and everyone became depressed
trapped in my own life
throughout this time the one and only
way for me to even briefly forget about
my situation was to pick up a controller
and enter the virtual world driving
sports cars climbing up buildings
exploring ancient ruins the
possibilities of how I could spend a
Saturday afternoon were truly infinite I
would become the driver assassin
archaeologists an NFL player I
controlled it felt submerged in a world
I could truly tailor to my liking I
later then got my first job saved up
money and bought more advanced up to
date video game consoles simply to play
better video games and spend my time in
a world that I could control and call my
own as I grew older I learned to code
ask Liu to even further alter and
control the virtual worlds I&#39;d
essentially gonna spend my life inside I
continued to improve my coding skills
throughout my senior year of high school
leading up to the day of my realisation
I was walking into a newly opened
electronics store and saw an oculus a
high-end virtual reality device far too
expensive or advanced at the time for a
kid like myself to ever even hope to use
let alone possess however that day I was
able to give it a try I was truly
immersed into another world unlike
anything I&#39;d ever experienced at first
hand witness the power of virtual
reality from that moment I began to
perceive just how incredible this
developing technology was could only
imagine what would evolve into I wanted
to watch virtual reality impact the
world and specifically impact those the
longed to be teleported into their own
world and myself since that day
technology has only continued to advance
faster and faster in 2015 Samsung
launched its own VR headset and as of
January this year they&#39;ve sold over five
million units virtual reality has
officially broken into the mainstream it
is glaringly apparent how widespread the
desire to enter virtual world
a desire that only continues to increase
however to many people it is still
unclear what exactly virtual reality is
and just how much it is capable of to
paint a better picture of what this
looks like I&#39;m going to tell you all
about hypothetical Helga however God is
not a huge fan of technology by any
means she has worked at the same job for
quite a long time and only recently
found out about the Internet as far as
she is concerned virtual reality is just
something out of a sci-fi movie that
might potentially maybe have like a
small chance of existing like 50 years
from now now let&#39;s try to visualize her
colleague hypothetical heart heart
thinks she has a pretty good
understanding of technology owns an
iPhone and even teaches a class about
computers her overweight cousin who
lives in his mom&#39;s basement once
mentioned VR to her and she is now under
the impression this is technology
exclusively for people that love world
of warcraft more than life itself
Hart dismisses VR completely and assumes
there&#39;s nothing more than a sweaty
overpriced helmet both Helga and Hart
could not be more wrong
any one of the well over five million
people that now possess this technology
would be able to tell them VR is very
real and is certainly much more than a
sweaty overpriced helmet however for
many people as well as hard the only use
case imaginable for virtual reality is
inside the video game industry in all
fairness the technology is perfect for
it the goal of video games is a
submerging in a virtual environment
providing an immersive and enjoyable
experience for the user throughout the
years
game consoles have continued to advance
working to accomplish this task virtual
reality could bring this to an entire
new level it has already done so
offering dozens of games already
available to play however as I&#39;ve said
before and will say again and again and
again the power of this technology
reaches so far beyond just videogames
today right now as I&#39;m speaking to all
of you
virtual reality is being used in the
treatment of burn victims transporting
them into a snow world to help them cope
with the pain they are facing before
surgery patients can actually build a
snowman inside of their hospital room
interestingly enough the Vieira&#39;s place
in hospitals isn&#39;t only for patients
either many cutting-edge medical schools
use virtual reality as a learning tool a
tool that can educate provide hands-on
experience and create doctors more
advanced and talented than ever before
learning by doing is arguably the most
effective method of training
unfortunately in some situations certain
activities such as performing open-heart
surgery are too expensive or too
dangerous to repeatedly practice in real
life some others might include flying a
plane enacting military combat maneuvers
you all get the idea the point I&#39;m
trying to make here is pilots use
virtual reality soldiers use virtual
reality doctors use virtual reality and
I use virtual reality this technology is
capable of so much more than people
realize
and it&#39;s just waiting to be applied and
utilized in every field imaginable but
even looking at today&#39;s current uses a
virtual reality there&#39;s truly no way to
predict where this is all headed imagine
several years from now when more
sophisticated virtual reality consoles
exist ones that were capable of
connecting to a user&#39;s a nervous system
virtual reality could provide the
physically disabled with an outlet a way
to experience that which abled body
person&#39;s take for granted a blind person
putting on a VR headset connecting to
their nervous system and being able to
see the virtual world around them being
able to see for the very first time in
their lives
someone who was paralyzed in a horrible
accident feeling the wind against their
face as they run through the virtual
world a sensation they&#39;ve grown to miss
more than anything when my mother walked
into Walmart and bought me that Gamecube
more than ten years ago there was no way
for her to possibly foresee or
understand that what she purchased that
day was so much more than just a video
game console she gave me the ability to
enter a virtual world the ability to
even briefly forget about the things I
wished I could change but was not able
to and gifted me a world of my own to
control the gift she gave me that day
completely changed my life each and
every one of us has something going on
in our lives that we wish we could
change but are not able to we all have
our own individual challenges obstacles
roadblocks and things that keep us lying
awake in bed at night in addition as
human beings we search for a way to
escape all of these for me I found that
escape inside videogames inside the
virtual world people who don&#39;t play
video games often wonder what it is that
makes them so engaging now others truth
is the real world can be unpredictable
evil chaotic and messy there always has
been and always will be things in our
lives we want to completely control but
camp our futures
health relationships money jobs the list
goes on and on
video games are clear if you do
something in a certain way you get a
certain result sadly that&#39;s not how life
works sometimes you do everything right
but everything goes wrong sometimes it
is easier to escape to a world
with life is predictable organized and
under our control and in ways that can
be healthy and unhealthy video games
provide this escape unlike anything else
a true escape to another world people
have always wanted to master their
environment since the dawn of time to
live in a world in which they control we
wanted our hands to be able to do more
that&#39;s why we have hammers we work hard
to be successful make money and fulfill
our desires goals and ambitions
essentially we envision a world tailored
to our liking the possibility is nearly
here for us to make a choice a choice
that prior to this technology never
existed the choice between living in the
real world following its rules accepting
the pain and struggles we deal with on a
daily basis and coming to terms with the
fact that there are things we cannot
change do or experience and attempt to
embrace these limitations or live in a
virtual world without any restrictions a
world so lifelike and convincing you
cannot even determine its authenticity
which one will each person choose as
I&#39;ve continued to mature and the
struggles in pain I once faced reside I
look back on when my parents got
divorced and how I handled it after
quite a lot of thought I&#39;m still unsure
if I should have handled the situation
the way I did I question if I should
have used the virtual world as an escape
there were countless other outlets that
could have utilized countless other ways
I could have distracted myself I could
have gone running collected quarters
hung out with friends done something
that was real or tangible but instead I
chose to enter the virtual world with
fewer restrictions essentially none
would you rather drive a Lamborghini or
collect quarters I personally would
choose a Lambo but sadly my current pay
isn&#39;t quite enough for me to afford one
but in the virtual world in my world
that doesn&#39;t matter I can make my
decision and spend the day driving an
electric green luxury vehicle across
Europe the only issue is that it isn&#39;t
real I&#39;m an 18 year old student I can
barely afford to go out to lunch I do
not have a Lamborghini however as the
power of virtual reality continues to
increase in advance the line between the
real and virtual world is beginning to
blur the virtual world the world I
control continues to become more real
and more lifelike each and every day and
it will continue to do so to the point
in which you can see hear smell feel and
even taste it imagine if you could fully
submerge yourself in the world of your
dreams over time this will transform
every aspect of life
and with the rate at which technology
continues to advance it is incredible to
envision what 15 10 or even just 5 years
will bring think reflect and consider
this what would you do in a world of
your dreams without any limits and just
how much would you give up for it
because to be honest with all of you
I&#39;ve yet to decide as well
