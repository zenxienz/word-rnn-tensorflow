when I pass my PhD I cried I don&#39;t mean
I did something very British and kept a
stiff upper lip and removed myself to a
dark corner and composed myself I howled
I howled in public now like a lot of
important moments of my life this moment
happened by accident I was curating a
conference very much like this one and
my supervisor was walking in so being
the sort of person that I am I opened
the door and he comes in and he&#39;s with a
new member of staff so there&#39;s a tense
moment of adjustment where we make the
professional introductions and I&#39;m
thinking and don&#39;t look stupid make eye
contact and I&#39;m listening to him and he
says this is Jess Hartley dr. Jess
Hartley and he realizes I don&#39;t know and
he smirks and he says she passed her PhD
today
I have a feeling that I didn&#39;t appear
quite as professional as I might have
wanted and I think that is down to a
couple of factors the noise ah as it hit
my body
it&#39;s tsunami of tears that arrived and
maybe it&#39;s just me but I know as soon as
I cry a lot something else is gonna
happen snot
there was a lot of snot I&#39;m not gonna
lie and maybe you&#39;re wondering why hit
me so hard I felt it in my body because
I&#39;ve worked for this I spent seven years
of my life diligently working towards
this one moment well the truth is that
up until that moment I believed I knew
that people like me don&#39;t become
academics now I bet you were looking at
me and you&#39;re thinking there&#39;s an
academic it&#39;s only the glasses all right
take those off I&#39;m slightly all good
awkward ginger woman no I do have a lot
of privileges the color of my skin opens
that door for me that I haven&#39;t even
considered needed opening because I&#39;m
middle class and that affords me with an
expectation and an aspiration I may be a
woman but I&#39;m slightly unruly woman what
I mean when I say people like me are
people who struggle to write as soon as
you give me a pen or a laptop
I am rendered inarticulate I have been
told so many times that my handwriting
is atrocious
I&#39;m a doctor now though that&#39;s only to
be expected
but my spelling is also atrocious I&#39;m
also someone that needs to move to think
you have no idea how hard it is right
now I&#39;m not allowed to go beyond the red
spot I need to move to think and I need
to talk in order to know what I think
sit down stop chatting you are here to
learn and that behavior disrupts the
learning of others I am one of those
people who feel ashamed when I give my
work to someone else and I know that
this is gonna hurt now partially this is
a story about dyslexia we&#39;re gonna leave
that to one side partially this is a
story about unruliness and what it is to
be an unruly woman and by that I mean I
don&#39;t like rules how many of us do if
you tell me not to walk on the grass I&#39;m
gonna want to know why what&#39;s so special
about this piece of grass and what&#39;s the
point of a park anyway if it&#39;s not to
run about on and I&#39;m so busy questioning
the rules that I&#39;m walking on the grass
and I&#39;m being disobedient
unintentionally education is a bit like
that there are a lot of rules the first
one is that you mustn&#39;t mention body
fluids there&#39;s also not a lot of
laughter in education there&#39;s a lot of
rules and there&#39;s a lot of expectations
and codes about the way that we believe
that we should behave people don&#39;t often
talk about love in education and snot
and laughter and love
so potent that that for me they&#39;re a
part of like what makes life worth
living so scroll forward a few years I&#39;m
a teacher I started in primary and
secondary schools and now I teach here
in the Royal Central Schools future drop
be academic if I had a pound for every
time a student has come to my office
knocked on my door and asked me to help
them to be an academic I&#39;d be really
really rich I can have a whole new
wardrobe black t-shirt maybe they
couldn&#39;t have been cashmere or silk
maybe not silk because I&#39;d snot on it
but isn&#39;t that interesting how do I
become an academic how do I change who I
am in order to fit a regulated system
these students have learnt to be an
academic is to not be like them they
have learned that they need to learn a
whole new language and behave in a whole
new way in order to conform and fit I
had also internalized those mechanisms
we have learned that in order to sound
like an academic we need to use long
fancy where it&#39;s like epistemology
and what you must never do as an
academic is say the word fuck
interesting response laughter an intake
of breath what I&#39;ve just done is behave
in the wrong way to be an academic is to
use the word epistemology and not use
the word fuck how many of the of you in
this room understand the word
epistemology yeah how many of you in
this room know the other word the clever
bit is knowing the fancy words the
clever bit is knowing that when to say
them and how to say them both of those
words are deeply threatening but
epistemology is the right way to be
threatening but anyone that says it
renders a distance between them and the
people who are listening you either know
what it is or you don&#39;t and if you don&#39;t
know what it is then maybe you feel
inferior because what we need to do in
order to conform to the Academy is to
speak the words of others rather than
the words of ourselves I learned very
early on in my education that I was
wrong and this sense of wrongness led me
to feel ashamed of my work research on
shame by Gersten Kaufman talks about
questions of Who am I and where do I
belong questions I hear every day in
that knock on the door help me to be
should I be here do I belong here am i
being authentic to myself yes he says
that these questions are forged within
the crucible of shame
it&#39;s a lovely image isn&#39;t it education
utilizes shame as a potent behavior
modifier that is when I perform an
action in front of other people and I
receive a negative response for it I
feel shame and I change my behavior
someone once looked at me and said is
that what doctors where is it and I
looked down at my jeans and my sneakers
and I was rendered inarticulate the true
answer to that is I&#39;m a doctor this is
what I&#39;m wearing today but the shame of
my education stops me from participating
in the conversation research from
Montana State University talks about
this a very thing it says that cycles of
shame stop a person&#39;s ability to believe
in change I&#39;m going to repeat that with
a different emphasis if we continue to
educate young people through a cycle of
shame particularly people from
marginalized communities who already
being courageous when they face us then
we risk telling those people that their
voices don&#39;t matter because nothing&#39;s
going to change
fuck that what if we stopped talking
about academic knowledge and started
talking about articulating knowledge if
I want to learn how to pirouette I
probably fall off the stage but so let&#39;s
not go there if I want to learn it I am
NOT going to read about it in a book
I might go to Carlos Acosta or Libby
Spencer to amazing dancers in ballet and
in tap who really thoroughly and fully
engage with the form and the technique
but what they also do is they put
themselves within it and they take their
technique to the boundaries of the
specialism now at masters level that&#39;s
exactly what we want we want people to
articulate knowledge at the boundaries
of their specialism so if I want to
learn how to tell a story
I&#39;m a look at Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
or JK Rowling&#39;s who changed my
understanding of what stories can be
through their writing and their speaking
and their being but I may also go to the
Aboriginal Australians whose culture of
storytelling speaks of environment and
identity and it is done it is not
written about it is done it is the
articulation of the knowledge that&#39;s the
clever bit not the mode of that
articulation I&#39;m working with two
amazingly bright wonderful sensitive
students at the moment who I&#39;m gonna
call Lauren and Mei they&#39;re both really
really struggling not to turn their back
and leave education Lauren has learnt
the scripts of academia incredibly well
she
is a high achiever expecting excellence
in our last tutorial she hung her head
in shame because she was only getting B
pluses and she shouted at me it&#39;s not
about me Jess she had learnt that in
order to be an academic you needed to
distance yourself from the work that&#39;s
the correct way of being in distance and
she was broken by it
Mae is a little bit different she&#39;s not
English and that disjuncture being in
this sort of institution rubs very
heavily on her she&#39;s incredibly
inspiring artist and when I see her work
I am inspired and I know no academia and
you but what she thinks is that when we
write a dissertation about it she&#39;s
hammering it in such a way that it kills
her art form and she doesn&#39;t want that
to happen and neither do I so I have
three key elements that I want to tell
you about today that I think are at the
heart of rupturing these cycles of shame
the first one is something that I call
tact tactful mess we turn the student
back to themselves with kindness and
firmness we are attentive to that
student who are you what are you doing
why are you here
it is about you of course it&#39;s about you
you&#39;re really quite good I don&#39;t know
very much as an academic I am boringly
repetitive it is about you to such an
extent then in our last tutorial Lauren
said to me Jess you&#39;re such a dick
and of course I our dick which leads me
to my second point the profane profanity
now my use of expletives and swearing
and profanity through this is a clumsy
mechanism that illustrates a point I&#39;m
sure many of you will be much more
sophisticated than me and how you would
perceive it by profanity I mean we need
to know what is said and what shouldn&#39;t
be said and why it should and shouldn&#39;t
be said and we question that we dance
with that we question what academia must
be for the individuals in it
profanity to such an extent that may and
I are rewriting what academia can be for
her so that it doesn&#39;t destroy her arts
we are rewriting it in her image and the
third factor in my triad of rupturing
things is love the amazing academic and
teacher bell hooks suggests that love is
a political act of rebellion to love
teaching is a political acts of
rebellion what she means when she says
is that if you invest your hearts in
this work in learning in the students
that it ruptures this distance that
we&#39;ve heard and brings us all together
equally in this mess of learning so I&#39;m
asking you today to reimagine a
university that enables students to
articulate knowledge through tact
through profanity through love and
through snot
so that they learn that they do not need
to be ashamed and that they can go out
and speak and change the fucking world
