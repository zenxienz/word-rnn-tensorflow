so just take a look around you and think
about your year group and ask yourself
the question who do you think is going
to be most successful in the next 15
years right
think about that who&#39;s going to be most
successful in the next 15 years and
don&#39;t give us any names but just shout
out why do you think those people are
going to be successful this is the
interactive bit sorry work hard keep
coming keep coming you must know some
successful people potentially
determination yeah
ambition motivation sorry yes exam
grades absolutely more more keep coming
resilience personality personality
exactly so now it&#39;s interesting actually
normally when you do that if I do this
to a corporate audience you&#39;ll generally
find that there are about 10 to 15
responses before anybody talks about an
attitude with you guys the first five
are all attitudinal and someone finally
said exam grades now how many of you
spend much of your time effort and
energy at school focusing on how well
you&#39;re going to do in your exams hands
up right how many of your parents tell
you that the future is based on your
exam success yeah absolutely right so
common sense tells us that we know that
our kind of attitudes in the way we show
up in life matters but most of our
energy and effort and the way in which
we define our self is based on our kind
of external success now twelve years ago
we set up a global coaching business
where what we wanted to do is we wanted
to find out why some people seem to be
successful in the toughest times in
their life and others kind of failed
right what was the difference between
those who are able to step up and
succeed and those who basically were
kind of undermined by the tough times in
life we expected it to be largely based
on a kind of combination of kind of
smarts IQ intelligence experience and
attitude now interestingly 35,000
Cochise later and the world&#39;s biggest
database on what it is that drives
success we find that is squarely about
attitude attitude Trump&#39;s intelligence
by nearly three and a half times you are
significantly more likely to be
successful in life if you develop the
right attitude sounds simple in many
ways it is so we&#39;ve distilled this kind
of research into we think there are kind
of 38 attitudes that really count the
most but there are three in particular
that relatively early on in your life
and career if you can develop these and
grow them you lay the foundations for
future success it&#39;s kind of essentially
we&#39;ve got thirty five thousand to prove
people to prove it and we kind of know
this as a simple truth so kind of
attitude number one very simple give it
a go even if you don&#39;t know now I don&#39;t
know for many of you you&#39;ll have spent
time around successful people who are
kind of largely admired because they&#39;re
great their exams they&#39;re fantastic on
the sports field they pay musical
instruments they never seem to put a
kind of step wrong in life now very
interestingly the younger you are in
your success the less likely you are to
step off that particular beaten track so
the better you are the earlier are in
life the less likely you are to take
risks because your self-esteem is
intimately defined by being brilliant
everybody knows you for being brilliant
and you&#39;re rewarded for it
and your likelihood of you stepping off
that path is significantly reduced
now there&#39;s an American professor called
Carol Dweck many of you will have heard
of her kind of fixed in growth mindset
study if you haven&#39;t fascinating stuff
you must look at it she got she put 400
students 10 11 year-old
across America and she put them into two
groups she gave them all a very simple
IQ test and questions which essentially
everyone was going to get between eight
and ten out and right and what they then
did is they simply they provided two
different types of feedback the first
group were basically told they did
really well and therefore they must be
very smart this was a demonstration of
their intelligence
and how good they were for the second
group with the same results all they did
was tell them that they must be people
who put it in effort reward you work on
the process that was the kind of
emphasis of the whole agenda for them
now surprisingly what happened next when
they looked at those two groups they
basically said well you&#39;ve got the
opportunity to take a math test an easy
math test or a hard math test the group
would base it being praised for being
smart 33% of them took the tough math
math test the group had been praised for
putting effort in 92 percent of them
took the tough math test they then gave
them a math test that none of them could
do was designed to be impossible for 10
and 11 year-olds interestingly the
people have been praised for being smart
spent nearly half as long doing the test
got frustrated and gave up whereas the
people who have been praised simply this
is all just about simple praise for
putting effort in spend twice as long on
the test and were much more prone to
enjoy it interestingly when they then
gave them the IQ test at the end of the
session again they did a kind of another
10-point simple question there was a 20%
reduction in performance for those
people who based on their their success
was based on their ability to do well
there was a 30% uplift for those who
essentially believed that effort was
what mattered and so for us in our
experience kind of working with
executives it appears that those people
who have defined their early career on
being good at stuff a much much much
less likely to kind of step out into the
unknown and therefore their propensity
to learn from their experience is
significantly reduced I mean if you kind
of if you&#39;re prepared to give a thing a
go when you don&#39;t know your
relationships are kind of risk and
failure changes dramatically and what
happens you kind of this sort of growth
and fixed mindset the direct talks about
I mean it it it means that your
preparedness to actually learn from the
mistakes in life not be defined by them
your capacity to make new sense of new
situations is enhanced massive
and probably most importantly your
courage is kind of triggered so
interestingly I mean for me
I spent most of my early life as a
relative failure in the eyes of both my
kind of teachers myself and many of my
my colleagues and peers however the
great advantage of that is I didn&#39;t grow
up with a belief that if I tried
something and failed it would
necessarily define me so I was much much
more likely to kind of give it a go and
see what happened now the irony is once
you start to do that that kind of clicks
in your capacity to learn and nearly
three times the rate of people who are
brilliant early in life second attitude
intimately linked to this the ability to
kind of burst your own bubble we talked
about the idea that for many of us we
kind of we grow up in an environment
where we&#39;re surrounded by relatively
like-minded people most of our friends
tend to think and act in a relatively
similar way and just basically the whole
question of psychological safety we like
to be with people who think like we do
the trouble with this of course is that
we are very unlikely to step off our own
beaten track unless either society
forces us so we have lots of kind of
good opportunities I mean it fascinating
time in my life when went out to Kashmir
and worked with a group of young 35
young people who were all in danger of
becoming radicalized so in Kashmir kind
of northern India it&#39;s been a troubled
land for many years since partition
there&#39;s a kind of a strong kind of
Islamic community who&#39;ve been at odds
with the kind of Hindu brothers and
sisters and just over the border in
Pakistan there are three jihadi schools
within 25 miles of this particular part
of Kashmir what we did with these young
people and interestingly of the 35 there
were 16 women in the group and 12 of
them have suffered sexual violence at
the hands of the Indian army of the 35
34 of them I had either a member of the
family killed or abducted by the Indian
Army and therefore hatred was very much
alive and well in that group and they
were all considering becoming jihadis or
suicide bombers in the next 12 months
right so those are the criteria upon
which they got involved in this
work all we did is we basically for five
days for the first two days we got them
speaking to people that they&#39;d never met
before we had the meeting here generals
from the Indian Army we had the meeting
politicians from the kind of other side
of the divide we had them made
fascinatingly we got them to talk to
some people who&#39;ve been involved in the
peace process in Northern Ireland and it
actually just built kind of communities
of practice and and had got the
Protestants and Catholics to kind of
spend real time together healing their
communities and not relying on their
politicians so all of this was
fascinating but the thing that made the
biggest difference was when we taught
these people to understand how they were
thinking so their reaction to all of
these stimuli and what they realized is
that their kind of worldview their kind
of strength of their beliefs and their
thoughts at the moment took them down a
cul-de-sac of hatred distortion and
exaggeration so we just literally had
them understand how their minds would
distort any input they were given no
matter how positive and take them back
to the same place so over the course of
this week they started to realize that
the problem wasn&#39;t the situation they&#39;re
in the problem was the way that they
were reacting to it and for me kind of
one of those powerful things I&#39;ve ever
been involved in was when we were
checking out at the end of this week
having the majority of them saying that
they&#39;re prepared to put aside the
suicide bomb and choose to be community
builders in their in their village
because that was all that was left for
them so for us if you kind of step off
your beaten track you kind of learn how
to notice your own worldview you will
unlock a combination of your
inquisitiveness your capacity to kind of
have a sense of what&#39;s possible and
crucially the ability to what we call
kind of critical you&#39;re afraid how do
you realize that your mind is actually
your friend rather than your enemy and
not just be trapped by the bubble that
you live in so if you do that the kind
of third area for us is it you&#39;re much
much more likely to end up leading a
life where you are naturally attracted
to the things that feel most meaningful
so many of you all have been told about
the importance of kind of follow your
passions or leading a purposeful life ad
experience is that if you&#39;re able to
kind of
even when you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re able
to kind of burst your own bubble meaning
we&#39;ll find you alright so we&#39;ve been in
situations where organizations that are
kind of part of the big food and drink
manufacturers the pharmaceutical
businesses the banks the leaders that
basically get involved in changing those
organizations trying to shake them up
wake them up and make forces for social
good are the people that demonstrate
those two attitudes because they&#39;re
naturally drawn like a kind of moss to
the things that matter than and there
are meaningful they&#39;re much more
naturally courageous they find the
temple radical in them and their
creativity is a source of joy for them
rather than something they go in search
of so for you the kind of irony here is
if you&#39;re not careful you will have been
sold a story that it&#39;s important to be
brilliant go find those things that
you&#39;re greater and stick with them the
truth is if you stick with what you&#39;re
brilliant at you will not necessarily
develop that mindset that enables you to
unlock the potential you&#39;re yet to
discover
so get interested in what you&#39;re not
rather than focus on what you&#39;re
brilliant at you take that with you no
matter where you go if you can develop a
mindset that enables you to kind of
unlock your inquisitiveness and find
your courage that&#39;s when you start to
shape the world you&#39;re a part of thank
you
