I&#39;d like to start by asking you all a
question what makes a city in some ways
I&#39;ve been asking myself that same
question every day for almost three
years it was around then that I began to
feel burnt out in my environment I was
back home for about three years at that
point and I felt myself plateauing like
a hermit crab I began to feel like I had
outgrown my shell and I needed to find a
newer bigger one to grow into so I
contemplated another move which was my
usual mo after high school and how I
managed to live in five cities in just
about six years after spending enough
time in this small city in the southwest
a huge city in the Northeast seemed like
the most logical choice but after
spending some time in New York to go
over my options I realized that a change
in scenery wouldn&#39;t satisfy me the truth
is I was comfortable and I wanted to
stay in my hometown but as a creative
professional I also wanted an
opportunity to make a living doing what
I loved that&#39;s what led me down a rabbit
hole asking myself why is it that the
two have to be mutually exclusive why is
it that creative industries are tethered
to these overpriced and over populated
areas why can&#39;t all cities sustain a
creative economy what is their benefit
for even being there in this day and age
and ultimately how do we even decide to
define a city today it was trying to
answer those questions that led me down
a new path in life where after a few
unexpected turns I find myself here now
trying to explain it all to you I say
that it was unexpected because it was
never my intention to build an end
result that would be worth sharing in
fact this whole thing started by just
simply asking people how they felt about
their city or about their community if
they were able to tell who was a part of
it or where it even started most of the
answers that I received from people
usually referred to a community that
shares some type of resource or history
or it was defined by a jurisdiction in a
boundary they&#39;re usually designated by a
government usually visible on an ID it&#39;s
about a population that shares the same
laws and infrastructure it&#39;s a mutual
benefit between its residents as logical
as all of these responses were I
couldn&#39;t help but feel they were just
wrong but I couldn&#39;t find a flaw in
their logic or offer a better answer
myself that&#39;s where I took my first turn
and decided to answer my own question
what makes my city it didn&#39;t take long
for me to see where my skepticism was
coming from in fact right away I began
to feel as if my own city didn&#39;t even
know how to explain itself because see
even if you&#39;re from this area this
simplified illustration might be hard to
understand and that&#39;s because people are
used to a representation that looks more
like this because of the narrative
that&#39;s so synonymous with this area this
is the place where three states and two
countries meet I&#39;ve even heard people
take it as far as saying this is where
three cities and two nations come
together as one when they&#39;re talking
about El Paso watterson Las Cruces with
the truth is this is just a fallacy in
all actuality there are more than 20
jurisdictions in this one small area and
oftentimes there is no unity amongst
them it&#39;s because of that misconception
paired with our history and my
experiences as a native that I began to
feel that none of these responses that I
had received from people could even
begin to apply to this area let me
explain
see we know that El Paso&#39;s namesake is
actually just a truncated version of its
original name El Paso del Norte the
passage of the north toward the north
and we have evidence to prove that
people have been in this region for over
10,000 years why we only qualify history
that has some type of European influence
is another talk altogether but even if
we fast forward but even if we fast
forward to the 15th century and the trip
made by Columbus we know that he landed
in Central and South America in 1507 we
have the Americas recognized as their
own continent for the first time in
history
it takes about 90 years for those
explorers from Spain to make their way
north and find themselves here where
they&#39;re greeted by locals and they
celebrate with a feast and a mass now
this is decades before pilgrims in
Plymouth Rock
it takes about another 60 years for
settlers to come into the area when they
build the foundation of El Paso del
Norte with the mission the Guadalupe in
just a couple years later natives
fleeing from the conquest in the north
make their way here where they&#39;re given
land and everybody who lives peacefully
for another hundred years this is all
before the United States is even a
country just about 20 years after the
United States becoming the country more
natives fleeing from the north end up
here and build Socorro all of this is
considered some kind of New Mexico
Territory because the Texas Revolution
isn&#39;t for another forty years and in
fact the Texas Revolution was never even
felt in this area it doesn&#39;t tell around
1850 that the land just becomes Texas
and it&#39;s around the same time that
they&#39;re building a military base on land
that has actually considered the
opposite of El Paso ironically just
about 20 years later the city of El Paso
is incorporated on the same side of the
military base and it takes another 15
years before El Paso South essentially
changes their name to Vadis I&#39;ve used
this river diagram merely as an example
the truth is like all natural flowing
rivers they change course over time the
river that existed here in the 15th
century isn&#39;t the same river that we
know today
in fact this path wasn&#39;t even agreed
upon until 1963 and that&#39;s partially why
our birthplace is now tethered to a
foreign country but it&#39;s the man-made
invisible boundaries that are still
having an impact on our daily lives you
see I was born and raised right about
here in the Lower Valley and
going up in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s
pre-internet my world was really small
the farthest west I ever made it on a
regular basis was to my grandparents
house in central it wasn&#39;t until later
on in high school that you might have
been able to find me on the other side
of the border because of a younger
drinking age just don&#39;t tell my parents
but um
it was around the same time that I made
it to the west side on a regular basis
and the first time that I did it felt
like a completely different City just
the roads the people the built the
buildings that 15 miles made me feel
like a foreigner uh but it was still the
same city ironically somebody who lives
just a mile away from a West El Paso
resident could be in the same zip code
but they&#39;re in a different city and if
that person were to cross a street North
they&#39;d be in the same city but in a
different state and that line matters
because if you&#39;re on one side of it
you&#39;re gonna pay a state income tax and
on the other side do not which leads to
a different infrastructure
representatives emergency services and
this whole area is riddled with these
dichotomies let&#39;s say if you&#39;re in this
area if you&#39;re in one of the safest
cities in the country but if you&#39;re
anywhere in this area you&#39;re in what
some people consider one of the most
dangerous in all of the world however if
you&#39;re anywhere in this section you&#39;re
in gun-toting Texas where you can openly
carry a gun on your person without the
need to even conceal it but if you cross
this line that&#39;s a federal offense and
if you live in this part of town your
kids can attend the same school is
somebody who lives here because they&#39;re
served by the same school district but
they don&#39;t have access to the same
public libraries in fact there are some
places in this county that still don&#39;t
have access to clean drinking water and
this field of view still doesn&#39;t even
include Las Cruces it&#39;s because of all
of that that I realized there is no way
to perfect like adequately explain what
my hometown is but I thought maybe
there&#39;s a way that I could explain
what my hometown could be and that was
actually just a lot easier I did it
visually and I changed some of my
methods by looking at las cruces and all
of the other municipalities in the area
I felt like I was looking at puzzle
pieces and it didn&#39;t take long for me to
arrange them in a way that kind of
resembled the city of Los Angeles in
fact there was only about a 20 square
mile difference once I realized that I
decided to compare this imagined city to
every other city and when I compared him
based on area and geographic size it
turns out that we could bank the top ten
list
we would be right ahead of Phoenix and
behind Houston when I did the math to
calculate population we&#39;d actually edge
out Houston and claim the number four
spot that&#39;s when I realized that it&#39;s
all of the fragments that give us the
illusion of being insignificant I
thought if only there&#39;s a way to
rearrange all of these puzzle pieces in
real life but the truth is we don&#39;t need
to all we need to do is just erase the
imaginary boundaries and that&#39;s where I
found my answer see because going
through that process helped me realize
the only way we can properly define a
city is by its people it&#39;s the
individuals who interact and understand
their surroundings in their environment
on a daily basis it&#39;s the collective
consciousness of the people that make a
city what it is and it was through my
research that I realized a small
paradigm shift in this area could
potentially lead to two and a half
million people understanding their
interdependence and potential in unity I
just needed to find a way to reach them
that was actually a lot easier to figure
out because people are more connected
than ever before because this just got
an easier than ever before
you see in the past crossing the street
in this area could have potentially
meant that your home phone number was
tied to a different area code or
possibly even a different country code
or your zip code might have been
designated by a different state or
probably came attached with
international shipping fees but now the
Internet is pretty much the same
everywhere and there are no limits or
extra fees for crossing borders but this
is still just a really simplified
understanding because the real magical
part about the Internet is the fact that
it&#39;s able to offer a transmedia
experience you see no matter what the
area code was that you put on your phone
it still just connected you to another
phone and regardless of the zip code
that was on mail it still just was mail
at the end of the day in fact everything
we&#39;ve ever known from changing the TV
channels on our TV or turning the dial
on a radio have only been able to give
us single media streams but a computer
connected to the Internet is able to
change media&#39;s and offer us just
completely new experiences and this is
still even an antiquated understanding
of the internet because now the Internet
is the living breathing thing it&#39;s
turning on our lights and thermostat in
our homes it&#39;s driving our cars and it&#39;s
making Pokemon characters appear all
around us it&#39;s forever changed the
global economy politics education and
just the human experience and it&#39;s
because of my understanding of the
Internet that I decided to build a
proprietary indexing method that can
help people understand and navigate this
area in a more democratized kind of way
that becomes more approachable and
offering more context to their
experience but it&#39;s not just the
geography that&#39;s changing I had to
decide which elements help establish a
sense of place
like all of the small businesses that
you won&#39;t be able to find in other
cities schools parks even the public art
that helps harvest a community&#39;s
identity this is a more centralized and
efficient way
to amalgamate public resources from
multiple jurisdictions it&#39;s that ability
to transcend a normal boundary that
prevents the public sector from being
able to do it themselves
and it&#39;s that manipulation of
traditional data that prevents people
like Google and everybody else to be
able to do the exact same thing this has
the potential to engage an entire
community not just the young in
tech-savvy which is why I was so
important to build in interfaces that
were intuitive and made people just
understand without even having to
overcomplicate things and because this
is meant to coincide with the human
experience there are no algorithms there
are no user modified behaviors which
have already splintered us so much on
social media and even though a lot of
these technologies are commonplace or
can even be considered regressive in
2017 part of the progress was in my
ability to do it all by myself and
that&#39;s where I took my last turn see
because even though I was a creative
professional before all of this
technology was not my strong suit
but because I went through this entire
process by myself I was able to learn
what I needed as I needed it thanks to
the educational opportunities available
on the Internet
that&#39;s how I was able to design all of
the data structures produce all of the
content code all of the interactions
without a team or investors without
taxpayer resources or special interests
and that&#39;s the power of going beyond the
status quo that exists today for all
private businesses
it&#39;s that ability to transcend the
status quo that makes them so powerful
because see now not only are people just
more connected than ever before but now
they&#39;re more capable than ever before
and that&#39;s why starting a business even
a micro business had the potential to
completely change and disrupt entire
industries but it also has the
opportunity to better serve a region and
a market that has never been properly
served it&#39;s because of that that I know
that this area will adopt a system when
it rolls out in the next couple months
because it was entirely conceptualized
and designed specifically to answer
their problem from their perspective
it&#39;s not a quickly scalable system
that&#39;s going to disrupt economies around
the world
and it&#39;s not financially benefiting any
major overreaching conglomerate that&#39;s
based outside of the area where it
serves it was it was entirely understood
by its locals it&#39;s what it&#39;s what
happens when you mix empathy and
intention with design and storytelling
and it&#39;s that level of human centered
design that needs to be understood and
incorporated by all businesses of all
sizes of by all nonprofit organizations
by all governments because there has
never been a perfect one-size-fits-all
and tech and media are no different it&#39;s
time that we start focusing on regional
technologies and regional solutions to
better serve the communities and the
people who use the product it&#39;s how I
feel that we can even begin to create
economic opportunities and creative
opportunities around the world and not
just tethered to these certain subsets
that have always gotten in because we
need to start being in the communities
that are using them and understanding
their perspective and I think this is
just the beginning because with all of
the advancements being made right now I
blockchain technologies and
decentralized autonomous organizations
we&#39;re approaching an era where societies
are going to be completely reimagined
and interconnected from the ground up
where an individual will be able to
store all of their medical records in
employment history education history
receive their paychecks pay taxes sign
government documents and even vote all
from a single device and we shouldn&#39;t
waste time trying to speculate what will
happen to political parties or politics
in general should voting become more
inclusive but we shouldn&#39;t question even
if just for a second the importance in
choosing a single interpreter when the
unequivocal will of the people is
understood in real time because it&#39;s
that threat to the status quo that is
going to delay the future especially in
these overpopulated mega centers we&#39;re
maintaining the norm is so imperative
but in a place that has been
marginalized disenfranchised and
incapable of proper growth since
inception
I feel the future will be a welcomed
alternative that&#39;s why I feel the same
way this area was vital to the new world
in bringing them north we can now become
the passage to the future thank you
[Applause]
