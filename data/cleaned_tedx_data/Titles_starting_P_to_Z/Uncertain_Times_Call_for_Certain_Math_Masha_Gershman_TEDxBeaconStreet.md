sorry i disappoint you not a NASA
astronaut but do you have some fun
things to say about math today life is
uncertain and unpredictable think about
your own lives how many of you have
emigrated changed careers change jobs we
don&#39;t know what our children will become
whether engineers and scientists or
artists and musicians we don&#39;t know what
kind of a world they&#39;ll face what we
know for certain is that they&#39;ll face
questions no one has asked in situations
that are new and foreign to them and our
question becomes how can we empower our
children to navigate through the
inevitable uncertainty of their lives
for my family and for those who were
raised in the tradition of Soviet
education the answer has always been
math from the 1950s through the 1980s my
parents were growing up in the Soviet
Union where the government was trying to
answer this question on a societal level
in the midst of the space age they
needed to grow a generation of minds who
could out-innovate and out-build in
education and being a totalitarian
regime they could force those who
weren&#39;t already into the process so
acclaimed mathematicians and
psychologists and scientists began to
look at this question and to build a
system of Education that would develop
Minds who could thrive in the world of
the unknown a core belief in Soviet
culture is that a child&#39;s potential is
not preset at Birth the mind could be
developed and what these academics
uncovered is that math is the best tool
to serve that development this is
something our modern society has begun
to accept a recent studies showed that
math skills in kindergarten and the
first grade are actually a better
predictor of later reading achievement
than early literacy skills our
the next question was how how could you
teach math in such a way that it would
empower children to look at
never-before-seen challenges with an
intuitive sense of how to approach them
there are four key elements to the
Soviet approach early development of
abstract thinking building mental
flexibility challenge and environment
the first early development of abstract
thinking was vital now when I say this
and I see by the looks here people
immediately assume that I&#39;m talking
about algebra and recoil but abstract
thinking is simply the ability to look
at data points determine the rule that
governs them and then apply that rule to
something new and children are
particularly adept at this manner of
thinking my daughter for example is
almost 2 and we recently started working
on colors we would do this at bath time
where she would get into the bath and
I&#39;d ask her to pass me the red fish took
about 2 months for her to do this
consistently and by the end it just
became routine should get into the bath
pass me the red fish and carry on what
she was doing and it became clear that
she didn&#39;t know what red was she just
knew that the mom was really obsessed
with that one fish and so then I moved
on and asked her to pass me the red ball
this one a little bit faster in about 2
weeks she was passing me the red ball
and then finally just a week ago I asked
her to pass me the red boat she paused
scanned all the toys in the bathtub and
passed me the red boat I no longer have
to point to different objects and say
this is red she has understood and
abstracted the concept and understands
that red is a color and I think if you
observe the children around you you&#39;ll
see that they live in this world of
abstract thinking it&#39;s how they make
sense of the vast amount of information
just hurtling towards them
second Soviets placed a fierce focus on
building mental flexibility people often
mistake quantity of knowledge with the
ability to apply it particularly when it
comes to math but to the Soviets the
goal was to build knowledge in such a
way that a child could look at a problem
in which the concepts skills and
techniques involved were uncool
here and approach it like a puzzle they
would pull from different areas of their
knowledge piecing together concepts in
crafting a strategy to reach a solution
and start from square one if that proved
to be a dead end
the third is challenged we don&#39;t grow
when we&#39;re in our comfort zone and
living in an environment of consistent
but not overwhelming challenge helps us
to shed that nagging fear of failure so
many of us have or the idea that things
should come easily now these three
things couldn&#39;t exist in a vacuum
environment was key to the Soviets math
was a social subject and I mean that in
every sense of the word the culture was
alive with this idea teachers in love
with mathematics would share that love
with their students by asking just the
right questions and providing just the
right hints to provoke lively
conversation classrooms were places
where children would exchange and debate
their ideas kind of what you might see
in an American English class so why do I
bring up this history of the Soviets
iron curtain fell the Cold War ended I
don&#39;t live in Minsk anymore hey because
if you look at the way we talk about
math education today it usually falls
into one of two categories either it&#39;s
utilitarian there are many STEM careers
and kids need to be prepared to grab
them or it&#39;s aesthetic math is beautiful
and all around us and kids should be
exposed to that beauty both of these
things are true but I think they missed
the point yes math can be both
utilitarian and beautiful but more
importantly and more profoundly the
study of math can be the vehicle that
delivers kids to their fullest potential
many people point to the various Soviet
firsts first satellite first dog in
space first man in space as a testament
to the success of this system of math
education but I don&#39;t really think
that&#39;s fair these were the achievements
of a small collection of great minds a
better proof of concept if you will was
the experience of Soviet immigration
hundreds of thousands of people fled the
Soviet Union before its collapse my
parents among them frequently like to
remind me that they arrived to the
United States with two children eight
suitcases and 360 dollars when they were
thirty they mentioned that last point a
lot they describe the experience of
arriving to the United States as being
akin to landing on the moon everything
was different not just the language but
the economy and the system as a whole
there were no mortgages in the Soviet
Union you were assigned a job I&#39;m sorry
you were assigned an apartment no
resumes you were assigned a job suddenly
they were forced to navigate an entirely
new world entirely alone for these
immigrants math wasn&#39;t a base of
knowledge upon which they found
employment it was a lifeline that
enabled them to understand this
completely foreign world a few years
after emigrating from Belarus to Boston
my mother came home from work and saw my
brother working on his math homework and
saw that he couldn&#39;t add two fractions
with two different denominators I call
this her come-to-jesus moment she saw
that not only could he not do this but
he also emphatically insisted it was
impossible and refused to continue the
question further now at this point I&#39;m
pretty sure her head exploded and most
people attribute that reaction to that
typical immigrant trope of child doesn&#39;t
know math this child won&#39;t get a good
job this child won&#39;t get married there&#39;s
no grandchildren I&#39;m sure that was true
knowing her and most immigrant mothers
but really what she was experiencing was
real crippling fear my brother&#39;s
inability to see beyond the specific
fraction in front of him and consider
what fractions actually are or to pull
from different areas of his knowledge
and try to figure it out and most
importantly that this inability caused
him to just completely shut down
all of this reflected that my brother
lacked the same training that had gotten
my mother through some of the most
uncertain times of her life this was a
turning point for her and she decided to
leave her job to tutor him in math and
soon after she and a fellow teacher
partnered to open the Russian school of
math and after school math and Richmond
program the school opened when I was in
the sixth grade and in his first year
classes were held at our kitchen table
which proved to be a particular
challenge for my preteen self as
suddenly every trip to the refrigerator
required an outfit change luckily that
didn&#39;t affect anything and today the
school serves twenty five thousand
students in pre-k through 12 across the
country what this is is a movement a
movement of people who feel that math
should be more now so far I&#39;ve spoken in
the theoretical but I&#39;d like to give you
a sense of what this type of math
instruction actually sounds like so I&#39;ve
prepared an audio clip and in this clip
is a third grade class that has just
been asked by their teacher what is
bigger 8 times X or 6 times
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
children living in the world of the
abstract be encouraged to share their
reasoning did you hear when the teacher
said so in a heavily accented Russian
accent it wasn&#39;t enough to say that
eight is bigger than six he had to
explain why that mattered and when the
little eight-year-old boy says I have a
counter in this case I have a counter
opinion and they all jump in and say yes
they could be equal if X is equal to
zero because eight times X and six times
just making sure y&#39;all with me imagine
what happens to a child&#39;s mental
development when they&#39;re steeped in this
type of intellectual broth for years to
be completely honest with you I didn&#39;t
understand or appreciate the
significance of this even though I was
raised in this mathematical culture
until just a couple of years ago when my
daughter was born my husband and I sat
in our hospital room making a list of
all the things we wanted her to be able
to do in order to be prepared for
whatever future was to come two hours
later and we still weren&#39;t done
she had to speak Mandarin because China
will take over the global economy no
engineering because those skills can be
taken anywhere and let&#39;s not forget hard
skills like building a fire and sewing
in case the Walking Dead actually
happens because it&#39;s kind of it hit me
suddenly that we were crafting a future
for her in which every minute of every
single day would be packed with some
activity aimed to prepare her for any
possible future and in a moment of
exasperation I thought I wish we could
just teach her to think to think
powerfully so that whatever happens she
can figure it out whatever world she
encounters she can navigate it
our teachers have this mantra that the
biggest tail between a student who&#39;s new
and one who&#39;s been with us for years is
how they react when given a problem
they&#39;ve never seen before the new
student will take a one second look
push the problem away and say I don&#39;t
get it a student who&#39;s been raised in
this environment of Russian math as it&#39;s
come to be called we&#39;ll take a look at
the problem
pause raise their finger and say let me
think I think if we change the way we
view the point of math and see it as a
tool for mental empowerment we&#39;ll have a
lot more kids approaching the challenges
of their lives with a calm let me think
thank you
