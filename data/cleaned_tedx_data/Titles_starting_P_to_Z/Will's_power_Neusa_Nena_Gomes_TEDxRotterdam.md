I&#39;m glad you could all make it here
today thank you for being here
thank you for sharing these next eight
minutes of our lives together here in
Rotterdam with me little know me my name
is on the screen
Nelson ana gomes i&#39;m going to have a
little talk about willpower because in
my opinion anyone anywhere could stand
in the deepest of the deepest of valleys
make themselves bigger than life and
still be able to reach the top of the
mountain by fingertips that&#39;s my story
the first time i truly ever felt a
connection with anyone was with oma
vilem oma vilem was an elder Caucasian
man who lived in Rotterdam my father was
a sailor my mother was a cleaning lady
and he took our whole family up into his
house there he noticed something strange
my father would always take my oldest
sister away to Amsterdam to go and visit
our brother he never took me along
because why I had the wrong color I came
out Brown looking like my mother and my
dad
a Portuguese Cape Verdean looking man
was a little lighter and brighter than I
was his son
living in Amsterdam also had that same
color for the shame I don&#39;t know for
what what reason I was left behind but
Uncle Will sat me down gave me a pen and
taught me the art of the word he taught
me how to write at the age of three I
knew how to write before I could ever
read
to me they were all drawings but I would
steadily
look at his hand and copy whatever it is
that he did and he also showed me love
he was the first person to look at me
with love in his eyes he was told
also this gift on me I learned how to
write fast forward 1983 February 17
Uncle Will was taken away from me he
passed away every morning I would go
downstairs looking for Uncle Will where
he usually would be ready sitting
waiting for me with his tea until the
rest of the house was awake two police
officers standing by his bedroom door
and one crowbar the door goes open and I
see Uncle Bill lying there on his back
positioned with one read the line
falling from his nose down to his cheek
he was dead it was frozen disconnected
and I still today stand there at a very
door looking back at him at my true
father with no place to go
February 18 1983 we moved from that
house February 19 1983 my baby sister
was born that&#39;s three days uncle William
passed away we moved from house and my
baby sister was born that meant that I
was no longer the youngest I was no
longer the youngest I was being looked
over and nobody told me about what
happened to Uncle Will nobody told me
about the new house nobody told me
anything I did what I could do best I
started writing I wanted him to be with
me still side I picked up a pen notepad
and I wrote whatever it was I could
write I kept on doing that and every
time I wrote down the word that word was
self love for me that word was Uncle
Will looking down at me
my childhood was not a nice one although
I did grow up to be a nice person
I was kicked out of the house at 17
again I was replaced by another baby in
the house
so my time was up I stopped school
started work did everything for myself I
paid the rent
I worked hard made my forty hours a week
and worked and I got disconnected
because I was sick every month I found a
new job then I got disconnected because
I called in sick again
found me a new job then I got
disconnected because I got sick again
this went on for about 21 years and when
I reached the age of 30 back in 2008 you
can do the calculations for yourself I
suffered a stroke at the office no more
speech for Nosa no more writing for
Nilsa no more doing this anything when
Elsa knows it was state of disconnect
landed me in the hospital and in the
hospital they didn&#39;t even know what to
do with me
I was sturdy too young to even suffer a
stroke but I was not gonna have it I was
not gonna spend the rest of my life in a
wheelchair after everything I had been
through every lesson I had learned was
love yourself choose for yourself be
there for you it doesn&#39;t matter whoever
throws you away you don&#39;t get to throw
yourself away I wasn&#39;t gonna go sit in
the wheelchair I walked around the
hospital for two weeks cussing and
cursing and fighting cussing and cursing
and fighting and trying to sing trying
to win back my power of speech after
three weeks it returned within two
months time I started back at work
reintegrating within four months time I
was doing 40 hours every week
as people were expecting for me to do
I&#39;m 39 years old today I will be 40 next
year look at me
I&#39;ve suffered a stroke but I am still
Nilsa
everything that you see my blood is
still the thing I love because it&#39;s
inside of me every word are right it&#39;s
inside of me it writes love for self I&#39;m
a teacher also when I returned to the
back to being in 2014 I binge watched
that TED Talks then I watched Lisa
Nichols talk about a Tonka truck I was
like that&#39;s me I&#39;m that Tonka truck Lisa
Nichols is talking about you can throw
me away oh I&#39;ll just come right back you
can fire me I&#39;ll find another job lose
my house I&#39;ll get one I need a new one
tomorrow because I&#39;m always looking out
for me and I want you all here in the
audience from this day this minute to do
the same
every minute choose for you choose you
because you are important like I was
important the whole world can throw you
away but if you have the world in your
heart and you become it nothing can
bother you nothing can touch you and you
can still stand in the deepest the
deepest of the valleys oh really
I don&#39;t think so you can stand in the
deepest
[Applause]
you
