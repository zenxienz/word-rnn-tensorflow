I have a question for you is it mitting
you&#39;re wrong a sign of weakness or sign
of strength and how hard is it for you
to consider that you&#39;ve gotten something
wrong I&#39;m not talking about small areas
what about when the stakes are high when
what you&#39;ve got wrong could affect your
livelihood or your involvement in a
community or even your own sense of
identity I wish that these questions
were just theoretical but for me they&#39;re
very real very right now questions that
I am wrestling with in a very public way
so let me tell you a little bit of my
journey I could take you to the exact
spot in my parents living room in
Gresham Oregon where I knelt down and I
prayed this prayer God let me write a
book that will change the world be
careful what you pray for
I was 20 years old I was young I was
religiously zealous I was certain and I
was restlessly ambitious youth zeal
certainty ambition not unlike the
ingredients of the Molotov cocktail they
have the tendency to to set the world on
fire and in my little corner of the
world that&#39;s exactly what happened
because incredibly my prayer was
answered I did write a book it was
published and it exploded it started to
sell and sell and sell the publisher
kept writing me saying we&#39;re going back
to to print it was selling tens of
thousands of copies every month I
remember the day that I went into my
local Christian bookstore and there was
my book the number one best-selling book
in the country and it stayed there for
four months I was on national radio
shows newspaper articles were being
written about me and my book the
pinnacle of my 15 minutes of fame was
when I was on the Bill Maher television
show sitting across
a young actor named Ben Affleck I had a
conversation with Batman my my book went
on to sell over 1.2 million copies and
was translated into dozens of languages
now if you were not a part of the
evangelical Christian subculture in the
late 1990s you will not have heard
anything about my book but if you were
growing up in that environment there&#39;s a
sense in which my book did change your
world now some people would say for the
better but there are a lot of people who
would say for the worse and there are
some that are still really pissed off
about that my book was called I kissed
dating goodbye a new attitude towards
relationships and romance I was writing
to fellow Christians I was saying we
need to be serious about our faith and
if we&#39;re serious about our faith we
won&#39;t have sex until we&#39;re married and
if we want to avoid premarital sex than
we should radically change our lifestyle
and that means we should stop dating
dating is the problem dating is a
distraction it&#39;s preparation for divorce
it leads the temptation I was 21 I knew
a lot okay
I should probably mention at this point
that I&#39;d been homeschooled my whole life
and I&#39;d only been in one serious
relationship at this point now you know
there were there were some things about
this book that I still think are good
some people were helped by the reminder
that you don&#39;t have to be in a dating
relationship to be a complete person
some people were helped to realize they
could take a break from dating and focus
on personal development and I still
think that there&#39;s a lot that takes
place in modern dating that can be
really selfish and harmful and some of
that needs to be challenged but my eyes
have really been open in the last few
years to see some some fundamental
problems in the book that I wrote you
know I didn&#39;t leave room for the idea
that dating could be a healthy way of
learning what you&#39;re looking for in a
long-term relationship that it could be
a part of growing personally I made that
the focus I gave the impression that
there was really one formula that you
could follow and if you follow that then
you would be happily married God would
bless you and you&#39;d have a great sex
life in marriage obviously the real
world doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t work that way but
probably the thing that I regret the
most is that there was a lot of fear
inside of me that I transferred into my
my writing and fears never a good motive
fear fear of messing up fear of getting
your heart broken fear of hurting
somebody else fear of sex yeah
why did it take me so long to see these
problems you know I think it was because
I was I was so afraid of being wrong you
know that book had made had made me a
best-selling author it had given me an
identity it had made me slightly famous
and it was so easy to just write the
critics off as haters you know those are
the haters and then find people who who
liked my book and hide behind them and
it mean isn&#39;t that the great thing about
the Internet no matter who you are or
what you think you can find someone on
the internet that agrees with you
you can literally be Hitler and find
people who think you&#39;re doing a good job
but it was so hard for me to face up to
being wrong because it felt like I was
it felt like I would be saying that a
big part of my life was wrong and didn&#39;t
have the courage to do that what helped
me to begin to let my my guard down was
a few years ago I stopped being the
pastor of a large Church and I went back
to school I went to graduate school and
I stopped having to be constantly write
about everything and defend all these
different ideas and I just became a
student who was listening and I
developed relationships with my fellow
students and a lot of them started to
share stories with me about the effect
my book had had and many times this was
a negative effect and I couldn&#39;t just
write them off as angry trolls on the
internet these were my friends and so I
listened and then one day on Twitter of
all places
this woman wrote me and she said your
book was used against me like a weapon
and I almost didn&#39;t answer her because I
was afraid she would lash out at me but
on this particular day I just answered
and said I&#39;m so sorry
such a a simple human interaction and
that interaction led to a conversation
and that conversation led to a
friendship and that friendship changed
me she said something to me that I&#39;ll
never forget she told me that
back and forth on Twitter was the first
time that a religious leader had ever
acknowledged getting something wrong and
ever apologized to her and I heard that
I just thought there&#39;s something really
unhealthy about this that led me to open
up my website and invite people to share
their stories of the effect my book had
had and we just published them
uncensored on the website some of those
were stories of people having a positive
experience but others were
heart-wrenching others were from people
who were really angry and hurt and now
I&#39;m in this process of working with a
fellow student at my grad school who was
a woman who was hurt by my book growing
up and we&#39;re producing a documentary
that&#39;s that&#39;s sharing the journey of me
going back in and looking at the book
but also trying to tell a bigger story
about how religious communities talk
about sexuality and talk about
relationships and what it looks like to
face up to moments when we don&#39;t get
everything right even when we&#39;re
well-intentioned we crowdfunded this and
we&#39;re giving the film away online and
hoping that will be helpful to someone
it&#39;s been such an emotional roller
coaster for me though you know there are
moments where I feel contrite and then
other moments where I swing over and I&#39;m
defensive and I&#39;m mad that people are
blaming me for things and a lot of times
I just want it I just want to run away
from the whole process but the reason I
don&#39;t is because I believe that this is
the pathway of growth for me but that
I&#39;m going to learn things and facing up
to what I got wrong that that I won&#39;t be
able to learn any other way I&#39;m
discovering that there&#39;s
transformational power in admitting that
you got something wrong a couple of
things that I&#39;m learning in the process
first I&#39;m learning that evolution always
involves death you know we talked about
how we want to evolve personally that
sounds great right it sounds
sophisticated I mean who doesn&#39;t want to
become a smarter stronger more loving
compassionate
version of themselves we all want to
evolve personally but think about what
evolution requires when you think about
the evolution of a species over
generations there&#39;s a lot of death that
takes place natural selection is a
traumatic thing we talk about the
survival of the fittest but think about
all those that were not the fittest that
did not survive there&#39;s death involved
and why should we think that that
personal evolution will be any different
it&#39;s never this this painless clean
process there there&#39;s a type of death
involved it involves dying to old ways
of thinking it involves dying to old
habits maybe even old relationships that
are keeping us from growing evolving
personally involves admitting that you
got some things wrong and letting those
things die the second thing that I&#39;m
learning is that you you can&#39;t rush this
process of transformation you can&#39;t just
rush through it I think most of us when
we realize we got something wrong we
just want to get through that as quick
as possible and get back to feeling
right and the way that a lot of us do
that as individuals or even as
organizations is we just change our
behavior and we don&#39;t actually
acknowledge that we changed or that we
got anything wrong and we want everyone
to just kind of you know pay no
attention to the man behind the curtain
or the past in some cases when we have
to say something about it we just give
these lame apologies you know the
classic line if anyone was offended I&#39;m
sorry to anyone who was offended in
other words it&#39;s really your fault for
being offended I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re offended
right we just want to get past it don&#39;t
really want to deal with all the tension
and the messiness of it we just want to
get back to being right but if you try
to rush through that you&#39;re not gonna
grow I&#39;ve been dragging out the process
even doing this documentary where I&#39;m
sitting down across from people who have
been hurt by my book and it sucks it
really does and yet it&#39;s in that tension
of asking these questions and facing up
to this that I&#39;m that I&#39;m really growing
and it involves asking questions like
what&#39;s shaped by
thinking what was behind that how did
that express itself how did that affect
other people and what do I need to learn
so that I don&#39;t repeat those same
mistakes
those are hard questions to ask that
don&#39;t come instantly it requires time to
think about a caterpillar the
caterpillar doesn&#39;t just one day
instantaneously sprout wings and become
a butterfly now a caterpillar literally
has to dissolve before it can transform
it forms a cocoon and within that cocoon
it becomes a caterpillar smoothie it&#39;s
not the most scientific explanation
before it can be transformed when you
are admitting that you got something
wrong they&#39;re gonna be moments where you
feel like you&#39;re dissolving you know
you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re losing your
swagger your confidence you may be
losing relationships you may even lose
your sense of self if you used to base a
lot of your identity and those ideas or
that practice or whatever it might be
but something new is being born so don&#39;t
rush through it don&#39;t try to skip it the
final thing that I&#39;m learning is that
admitting that you&#39;re wrong will tick
some people off I wish that I could say
that you&#39;ll just get a bunch of people
coming alongside you and patting on the
back and saying oh it&#39;s so humble of you
to process this but expect resistance
and it makes sense doesn&#39;t it because
there are people in your life who were
invested in the old you there are people
in your life who want you to stay the
same maybe because they just love you
love you the way they are but also
possibly because if you admit you&#39;re
wrong and they agree with you then by
implication they are wrong and they
don&#39;t want to deal with that so they&#39;d
rather you just stay the way you are
then have to face up to that themselves
so I mean if you&#39;re in one career and
you decide to switch careers all the
people who helped you get there and
vested in you there they&#39;re gonna take
that personally or if you&#39;re part of an
organization and you begin to question
whether you&#39;re wrong about ideals and
values that are at the core of that
organization that&#39;s gonna feel like an
attack to that organization they&#39;re not
gonna like that it&#39;s an interesting
thought exercise just to the process you
know if I were to change my mind and
admit that I was wrong about XYZ fill in
the blank where would I get pushback it
could come from family come from a
religious community come from a business
that you&#39;re a part of you know the
hardest part for me of re-evaluating my
book has been interacting with people
who love my book because they&#39;re so
confused and they&#39;re so supportive and
I&#39;m so grateful for them and yet as I&#39;m
questioning my own book which I feel
like I should be allowed to do because
it&#39;s my book I can tell that they&#39;re
like you&#39;re not allowed to do that
because they made decisions based on the
ideas in my book and they feel like I&#39;m
criticizing their life which I&#39;m not I&#39;m
not at all doing that and I&#39;ve really
sought to honor them and respect them
and hear their stories but at the end of
the day I know that I can&#39;t be
controlled by someone else&#39;s viewpoint I
think the big idea that I really want to
leave with you is this I think a lot of
us have been wrong about being wrong
we&#39;ve been so scared of it we&#39;ve been so
afraid of it we viewed it as weakness we
viewed it as something that that should
is shameful and so we&#39;ve shunned people
who have gotten things wrong you know
just fire them push them aside and find
right people and it&#39;s the right people
who are never wrong that we want to
follow and we want to have leaders but
think about it people who are always
right they&#39;re not really growing they
can&#39;t change if they&#39;re always right and
they change and they&#39;ll be wrong you
follow me
now I think we need to change our
thinking and to realize that admitting
that you&#39;re wrong really takes a form of
strength and so instead of viewing it as
a dead end we should view it as a new
start and instead of shunning people who
admit they got something wrong we should
encourage them and invite them to come
and share the wisdom that they&#39;re
learning you know the the great news the
great news about learning to admit that
you got something wrong is that you
don&#39;t have to be so afraid of being
wrong which means you can move toward
people that see the world differently
than you and not be so terrified that
they might change your mind it means
that you can dream and dare and risk and
live thank you so much
[Applause]
