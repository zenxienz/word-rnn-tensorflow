you you need to slow down you&#39;re too
distracted you&#39;ve been ignoring yourself
in this digital age
I get it today I&#39;m going to introduce to
you a new way to decelerate to just sit
and think about you what have your
distractions caused you to miss I
experienced a sensory phenomenon called
synesthesia this is a neurological
condition where there are two sensory
responses to one stimulus so for example
my sound color synesthesia or the sound
of a trumpet is a deep orange Alicia
Keys this voice is a soothing maroon
ariana grande her voice is bright pink I
don&#39;t like pink but my emotion color
synesthesia where my emotions present
themselves in colors this is by far the
hardest to deal with their vivid
visualizations in colors shapes patterns
they make it really hard for me to
ignore what I&#39;m feeling there are over
100 synesthesia types I have eight and
most of them are color related having
this extra sensory ability gives me the
opportunity to create the music that I
perform while you&#39;re hearing harmonious
layers
I see color filled sheets of music being
written as the song develops
this is for you for the busy mom for the
on-the-go executive for the student the
driver for the at home dad for all of
you who are incredibly busy and just
need a break my sensory experiences have
shown me a great way to slow down to
acknowledge yourself your emotions spy
music meditation so this is what I&#39;m
gonna do I&#39;m gonna perform another song
to let you in on my world there will be
a video display of what synesthesia
allows me to see engage the music notice
the changes in your breathing imagine a
scene place or thing and let this song
be your sound track but right here right
now let&#39;s just
Oh
