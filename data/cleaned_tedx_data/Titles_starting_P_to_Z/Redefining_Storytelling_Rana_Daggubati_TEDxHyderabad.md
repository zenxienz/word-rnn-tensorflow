so before I begin I&#39;ll give you a little
disclaimer of of all I actually grew up
in what the movies mean to me when I was
a young kid I thought Mahatma Gandhi was
someone who look like Ben Kingsley and I
thought Adolf Hitler was a look-alike of
Charlie Chaplin so from here on you
decide if you want to take me seriously
or not because that&#39;s how I grew up you
can either think this guy loves the
movies and he&#39;s here and he&#39;s continuing
to work here or you could just think
that I was a dumb kid in school who just
went to the movies so let me tell you
how it all started not for me but for
the world itself we all know the times
of kings we&#39;re where kings governed
everything and but the Kings had
something very very special they wanted
to showcase culture to the world to the
neighboring kingdoms so who is
showcasing culture artists were
showcasing culture dancers musicians
poets people would create literary works
and then what happened the Kings
disappeared and we lived in the world of
democracy I&#39;m sure life is better but
not so good for the artists at that
point because all of you guys weren&#39;t
paying money to the artists and it all
started in about 1894 when these two
fine gentlemen the Lumiere brothers
discovered something called cinema where
you projected a moving image from film
onto a big screen and there was a lot of
public gathering that&#39;s when the artists
found their space again and as
technology kept evolving when silent
cinema became which had sound in it
musicians came in sound engineers came
in when it moved into color artists came
in painters came in and so on and so
forth so by somewhere in the early
nineteen hundreds about 1914 1915 was
where cinema really was the keeper of
the Arts where a bunch of different
artists from different spaces came
together to tell this beautiful world in
their format of storytelling which was
cinema and that&#39;s where it all started
for everyone and India came in exactly
that time 1913 was when Raja
Harishchandra
first Indian silent feature film was
made I don&#39;t know if you guys are
familiar with this image but this was
the first-ever film screening in France
in the late 18-hundreds now so when when
India came in we started with Raja
Harishchandra which was a silent film
and we obviously took this to the same
ero of Technology coming into the movies
now that&#39;s where this that&#39;s about 100
years ago and about 50 years after that
is when we began we came into the movies
my grandfather was a farmer in a little
village in Andhra said I want to tell
stories and he moved to Madras and
started making movies that&#39;s an image
from our that&#39;s the poster of her first
ever feature film and when we came on we
were a film production house what is the
film production house it&#39;s a house that
makes movies and then eventually gives
it to a studio to distribute it to
exhibit it and so on and so forth and
then we moved to a city called Hyderabad
and it was an ever-evolving space where
we were given land and said let&#39;s make
cinema and industry so then there we go
we came started production we moved in
from there to distributing our own
content to exhibitors to different
people we went into exhibition
exhibition which was actually directly
working with the theaters or owning
leasing those theaters or building
theaters to see to that the story that
we are telling transcends perfectly to
each and every one of you and then what
did we knew we needed infrastructure to
make better and better movies we built
the film laboratory we built sound
stages we built sound design spaces
enhancing digital theater sound visual
effects all of those to tell better and
better stories but what happened then it
all changed it all changed how it
changed with the medium of of the
digital world we had something called a
film laboratory where film used to be
short processed and then ultimately made
ready with multiple copies of prints for
all of you all to watch in the cinemas
with the rise of digital that went away
so the infrastructure was not the same
anymore
what we realized was we were
storytellers who were trying to make a
formatted business out of this
now while cinema is evolving like this
the other part of the world was really
fast evolving where television came in
and that&#39;s when people decided to sit at
the luxury of their own in the in their
own homes with their family members with
their loved ones and start watching
cinema there then came on the giants of
the Amazons and the Netflix were there
and your smartphone which is now part of
all of us and you started watching
stories there so what did we have to do
we have to tell stories in every single
platform that&#39;s available now this thing
called the new ecosystem was something
that we didn&#39;t understand something that
nobody even now still understands where
it&#39;s heading so what did we need I mean
we were talking about movies we all
bought tickets went to the movie theater
we all sat at home watch TV maybe made
popcorn at home also now we watch it on
cellphones we have our fancy laptops
that have high-speed Internet and all of
those we watch story is there but today
technology has changed so much we moved
into something called augmented reality
virtual reality what&#39;s augmented reality
reality they were an actor or an artist
is actually on your phone performing for
you personally you can take videos with
them you can take pictures with in
virtual reality where all of you can
actually walk in to this great world
where the movie is being made yes all
this is happening today
now who makes all these things is it
artists no we just are tools to tell
these stories but it is people with
technology people who understand
innovation so that really was the change
when I speak at events like these the
first thing that someone asked me
yesterday was why you speaking Ted it&#39;s
not a paid event you&#39;re an actor so the
only reason I&#39;m here is to tell all of
you guys that there is a space out here
there is an opportunity and why would be
able to do it because change comes with
a lot of hard decisions to make when
film moved away my mother used to run
the film laboratory and everything
became digital nobody was shooting on
film anymore we had to shut the film
laboratory an institution that was there
for many many years
we had to let very very close personnel
go away and that&#39;s really heartbreaking
for all of us because all these years we
thought this business is going to go on
in a certain format and it all changed
so you have to be ready to pick that
opportunity and the good thing is with
change if you embrace it well there is a
great opportunity I did a film called
baahubali have you guys seen it
and it&#39;s a really cool movie yeah thank
you so when I did that film it was it
was breaking norms of every single
storytelling pattern it was a Telugu
feature film with the Telugu film
director telugu film actors to do
production that was short here and we
were trying to make something which is
far bigger than anything that&#39;s made in
this country or this part of the world
and how did we do this
eh there was a great storyteller it was
the director of that from believed that
stories will last forever and took
inspiration everything from from the
soil that he has grown up with said we
will propagate our culture we will put
it up there on this silver screen for
the world to see and it was not just him
it was the producers of that film people
who were smart who were educated who
moved in from different fields of
business from whether it was technology
whether it&#39;s the dot-com I mean they
were all over the place and then they
came to the movies so they finally made
a method to this madness
they made a method to how great cinema
can be told and all of you all saw the
result we made a film called baahubali
which was made on this very soil in
Hyderabad city and the world woke up to
I was thank you
and why why could we why was that
possible that in for a simple reason
that they were artists they were people
of business there were people from many
many different fields and I have many
friends I have people in society who
still don&#39;t choose entertainment as a
career now we&#39;re at Ted it&#39;s technology
entertainment stands right in the center
sir and their design after that so we
need people from business we need people
from technology we need people from
design and every other field that can
help us tell better and better stories
and there&#39;s one thing that I have to
tell all of you guys is if you guys back
the film makers that are here if you
start innovating for them if you start
giving them technology empowering them
with all the business ideas that all of
you have sir we have made bubbly ones
and our filmmakers will go over and over
to do it again
now you can even really think how is
this possible
how can we do this I mean to do this we
need a business format or maybe we spoke
about technology we spoke about
infrastructure we spoke about every
single thing that all the other
businesses said come look at this as a
business this is going to be definitely
the largest largest growth pattern in
this country because we still have it we
have a big margin to hit and that big
margin is only possible with all of you
here helping us tell stories better so
ladies and gentleman this sir is proving
the artist is going to be there the
artist is going to be there in
television in film in in your cell phone
in every single place a story is told
it&#39;s just that he needs you to empower
him the web the web is suddenly opened
out to telling stories all of you could
be solely tellers every single person is
actually a storytellers because I have a
story to tell you have a story to tell
so do you and like that the web has
offered solutions for everyone to come
and tell stories
so let&#39;s come together on these
platforms and tell these things now
technology we spoke about augmented
reality we spoke about virtual reality
and there&#39;s many more coming and every
single day I&#39;m at a new forum there&#39;s
new technology and a new ever-evolving
telling stories now how do we tell these
things this is not a storytellers job to
figure out these new ways so the first
time I met somebody who is doing
augmented reality they were actually
doing it for construction work at and
trying to make make it look like okay
furniture is here this is how it&#39;s going
to look we just picked that technology
up we plastered on a film poster and
things changed things changed because
cinema has the power stories have the
power to communicate to every single
person living on this planet and that&#39;s
what cinema can really do and say Gosa
so so all I have to ask you guys by the
end of all of this is if you can empower
us with innovation if you can create
better ways for us to tell stories if
you can help us with your great business
practices that you have from across
various business platforms come in here
and let&#39;s tell two stories together and
sir we&#39;ve done it once and we will make
sure all the artists and I speak for my
entire fraternity that we will do
everything that&#39;s in our might to tell
great stories to the rest of the world
and India sir is a land of culture and
the greater stories so thank you thank
you very much let stories be told thank
you
[Applause]
