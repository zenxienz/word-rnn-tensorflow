I&#39;m dedicating this talk to everyone in
the middle and by middle I mean my
fellow Midwesterners as well as anyone
living anywhere who approaches life from
the middle-of-the-road
rather than from the extremes we all
know those middle stereotypes don&#39;t we
flower country Vennela ordinary well I
don&#39;t believe those words apply any
longer if they ever did in fact I&#39;ll go
one step further I believe that the
middle is the new edge you&#39;re the people
who can solve today&#39;s big problems and
launch tomorrow&#39;s new ideas to move this
society forward there&#39;s evidence this is
already happening which I&#39;ll share but
first let me tell you what I know from
my own personal experience sorry about
as middle as they come I was born and
raised in the heartland in Kansas and
Nebraska not far from the geographic
center of the United States I&#39;m
middle-aged I Drive a midsize sedan that
I park in front of my mid-sized house
politically and socially moderate middle
even on my personality assessments I
score in the middle of the scale halfway
between extrovert and introvert creative
versus analytical flexible versus rigid
I&#39;ve spent my life in the middle and
that&#39;s not just geography it&#39;s a mindset
a temperament and a perspective on life
so right about now you might be
wondering how did someone like me become
the head of a two billion dollar
organization one of the most innovative
and influential foundations in the
country I mean let&#39;s face it most
leaders and innovators are viewed as
unusual people with exceptional skills I
used to think that too
after I graduated from the University of
Nebraska I moved to Southern California
and man I could not wait to leave my
Heartland roots behind it was gonna be a
fresh start for me I was gonna be an LA
girl people out there would ask me so
where are you from and I&#39;d kind of shrug
them off and say I didn&#39;t matter you
know I&#39;m just from somewhere in the
middle
well my valley girl accent has long
since faded and I&#39;m a lot wiser now and
I&#39;ve realized that my middle miss is
nothing to be embarrassed about it&#39;s not
a liability it&#39;s an asset and it can be
for you too so let&#39;s break this down
just what does this middle miss mean to
me I&#39;ve got four points first it means
being centered we people in the middle
don&#39;t get too carried away with extreme
emotions I think it&#39;s the weather in the
Midwest right it&#39;s taught us that when a
storm in life hits it&#39;s best to keep a
level head second we middle grounders
tend to be practical rather than buying
into some magic bullet philosophy we&#39;re
more interested in what works which is
usually a combination of a number of
approaches coming from the middle also
means having a healthy sense of humility
of course we have egos we just don&#39;t
focus on feeding them rather than doing
flashy provocative things that draw
attention to ourselves we try to
collaborate and draw others in to create
solutions with us in this time of
extremes in our country that is a very
valuable quality and in fact there&#39;s
research that backs this up according to
the Center for Creative leadership the
ideal leaders are people who can foster
learning and collaboration in changing
times and I think we can all agree in
our country now we need people more than
ever who can build that kind of common
ground
finally we&#39;re resilient we don&#39;t blame
others for our problems or get defeated
by setbacks instead of making excuses we
try to make it better there&#39;s a quote I
love that comes and I think it kind of
describes the essence of this concept
and it comes from the US president who
made the Dakotas
at home Teddy Roosevelt he said do what
you can with what you have from where
you are there&#39;s evidence that the Spirit
has reemerged the Midwest in a new and
powerful way at the Kauffman Foundation
we study and support entrepreneurship
and while startup activity in the u.s.
is half of what it was a generation ago
our data show that entrepreneurs are
making a comeback and the mid country
states are playing the role of the
comeback kids so of the ten metro areas
with the biggest jumps in
entrepreneurial activity last year six
are in the middle of the country here in
Fargo startup activity has increased
every year for the past three years
what&#39;s the city with the highest
percentage of women-owned businesses
Denver and the picture is even more
encouraging when you look at the kinds
of new ventures that are being launched
by people in the middle because not all
of them are chasing just the hottest
trends that cater to the 1% like digital
juice machines or whatever we&#39;re seeing
everyday people attacking everyday
problems and turning them into positives
here&#39;s one of my favorite examples so
the Mississippi River watershed has a
problem with an invasive species of fish
called Asian carp an Asian carp are
different than common carp and it turns
out they taste good so Vietnamese
immigrant lululu started a company in
Paducah Kentucky to solve this problem
fin gourmet contracts with people to
fish for Asian carp hires unemployed
individuals to do the processing and
then sells a variety of fish products
very creatively branded as Kentucky blue
snapper to restaurants and consumers as
a result they&#39;re turning an
environmental issue into an industry
putting people to work and reducing our
reliance on imported foods another
example is from my hometown in return
strategies was started by Kansas City
businessman Jim Atwater
Jim is hearing-impaired he realized that
that many of the country&#39;s disabled
workers are higher
capable but about 70% of them are
unemployed so his firm places people
with disabilities into jobs where they
can thrive and that business is growing
too our country still needs plenty of
high-tech scientific startups and look
I&#39;ve got nothing against fancy apps or
juice machines but at the Kauffman
Foundation we&#39;re giving increased
attention to grassroots startups that
are solving everyday problems we believe
our country&#39;s best path forward for the
long term is to produce more new
ventures of every kind
studies show that startups punch way
above their weight when it comes to
creating jobs innovation and opportunity
in our economy in fact most net job
creation in this country comes from
firms that are less than five years old
the good news is this momentum in the
middle goes beyond starting companies
we&#39;re seeing people coming together to
solve problems in other interesting ways
like in Cedar Rapids Iowa where a high
school teacher and a group of citizens
decided hey let&#39;s do something about the
fact that our education system is a
little out of touch with modern reality
so they created the Iowa big school a
new public high school built on an
entirely different model big school
students spend a lot of their time
working on real-world projects like
creating a virtual reality display for
History Museum or improving inventory
flow at a local distribution company one
student worked with a mentor in the
garment industry to design clothing for
women who aren&#39;t shaped like fashion
models while other students are working
with architects and engineers on City
Planning issues the common theme with
fin gourmet in return strategies in the
big school is that none of them came
from certified big thinkers and elite
enclaves they came from middle-american
proving you don&#39;t have to be extremely
gifted extremely famous or extremely
anything
make a big difference in the world it&#39;s
all matters seeing what is and seeing
what could be and then doing what you
can with what you have from where you
are at the Kauffman Foundation we draw
inspiration from our founder Ewing
Kauffman who is a great entrepreneur in
his own right mr. Kauffman called
himself a common man who did uncommon
things in my role as CEO the foundation
I strive to be a common person who
enables uncommon results my minimus is
the core of Who I am and I know now that
it is my greatest strength I encourage
you to embrace your middle self and make
it a strength for you to our country
well thank you because there is no
shortage of good work to be done as
great as our society is it is still far
from what it could be I believe it&#39;ll be
you the grounded practical collaborative
people who live and approach life in the
middle will play a big role in taking us
there you are the reason that the middle
is the new edge
