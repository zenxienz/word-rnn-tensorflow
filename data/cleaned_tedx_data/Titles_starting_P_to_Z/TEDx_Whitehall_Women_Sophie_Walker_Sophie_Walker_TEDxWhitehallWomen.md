hello have you ever wondered how many
bridges there are right across the UK
and many of those vital constructions we
depend upon to bind together our towns
in our cities no villages how many of
them spanning waterways and valleys
coastal inlets and canals high-rise
blocks supermarket malls train lines
road intersections ensuring the smooth
flow of traffic cars lorries buses
access for pedestrians and cyclists
paving the way for all of our daily
interactions between our communities
between our Commerce&#39;s so many of these
bridges so many ingenious devices
I confess I spent a bit of time online
looking up some of these I&#39;ve got a bit
geeky about it so you can have a simple
span across beams and girders can have a
suspension bridge hung from I bars metal
roofs complex crescents of integrated
super structures and substructures
to which we give no thought at all as we
cross across them orthotropic beams
resists stress in multiple directions
all for some norsu tropic beams
it is extraordinary what you can find
cantilevered arches resist the load they
spread it in different directions
covered bridges I love this one covered
bridges are constructed from a series of
diagonal webs called a truss which are
calculated to complex mathematical
calculations you get bonus points
because there&#39;s so many of these if you
can spot the different kinds my favorite
is a double intersection prat
or a triple Whipple new old ancient
modern we use them all the time so much
so that we forget their fundamental
function
imagine if overnight a whole load of
them disappeared let&#39;s say 2/3 imagine
waking up tomorrow and finding yourself
cut off from your neighbors your
communities your friends your workplace
imagine the chaos and the isolation of
your life now imagine central
government&#39;s response was what you want
us to do about it you chose to live
where you do we&#39;re not gonna pay for
your lifestyle decisions I think some of
you can see where I&#39;m going with this
right we would never dream of talking
about physical infrastructure in that
way we talk about social infrastructure
like that all the time the silent
underpinning done by millions and
millions of carers that allows our
economy to function undervalued
underpaid dismissed and dismissed why
because this is primarily the work of
women mothers grandmothers daughters
auntie&#39;s nieces wives the army of people
who step in and do the vast majority of
the hard work of raising children of
caring for people with disabilities of
looking after elderly relatives tending
to people who are ill providing
end-of-life love and support it is
estimated that the economic value of
unpaid care provided by women every year
alone in the UK is 77 billion pounds 77
billion pounds all those women waking up
every day having to build their own
bridges underpin their own support
structures travel precariously along
paths alone
and other women see and remake time
after time after time and so our
productivity lags all our other g7
nations our economy is frayed our
society is frayed because half of our
population is invisible and why because
every era budget time the Chancellor
from whichever party though it&#39;s as a
man stands up and says I&#39;ve got a
brilliant idea to get the economy going
we&#39;re going to invest billions in
infrastructure finance ministers for all
political colors will talk about their
industrial strategies because these are
men&#39;s jobs building those bridges the
real physical ones roads house building
factories technologies Britain is going
to spend 23 billion pounds in innovation
and infrastructure over the next five
years women&#39;s jobs expenses to be cut
sure start health care Social Care the
UK has got the most expensive child care
in the world spending on social care for
disabled and older people has fallen by
11 percent in like-for-like terms and
the number of people receiving
state-funded support has fallen by 25
percent
at least do you know what the state
calls a woman who in those circumstances
now stays at home to look after her
children and maybe also her elderly
mother you know at the treasury&#39;s term
for that person is economically inactive
this is not only unjust it is not only
unfair it is very very stupid
because care is a vital vital
construction that can transform our
economy and furthermore it has been
proven that investment in care brings
twice the employment and twice the
economic benefits as investment in
construction the women&#39;s Budget Group
worked over if you invest two percent of
GDP into construction you get 750,000
jobs if you invest two percent of GDP
into care you get one point five million
jobs and those 1.5 million jobs bring
with them 40 billion pounds in higher
tax revenues and reduced benefits so
no-brainer right you would think so
right care is the bridge that takes the
strain from our society it brings us
together and it is a fundamental
investment if we are all to finally
flourished and if women are to be equal
because a government that cares about
business cares about child care a
government that cares about closing the
gender pay gap cares about shared
parenting a government that cares about
families understands that unaffordable
services are leaving them behind have
you ever had a conversation about
childcare with a woman who is not from
the UK I have I have had a conversation
with a woman from Iceland whoa that was
like talking to someone from a different
planet and she said to me that before
she came to the UK she&#39;d never even had
to think about choosing between work and
children when she talked about the
investment in childcare the investment
is shared parenting if she wasn&#39;t
talking about the theory of it she was
talking about the practice of it and how
in practice it revolutionizes workplaces
it changes the visibility of fathers at
work it changes the visibility of
mothers at work it changes everything
for all women because you are not seen
as a potential liability because you
live in a society where everybody has a
stake in care and everybody cares about
it and listening to her I realized how
far we have to go I thought about what
my life would be like if I&#39;d
had to worry about childcare if I&#39;d
never had to worry about paying for
childcare meeting the cost of childcare
if my husband had been able to share
those precious gorgeous baby days if I
didn&#39;t have to worry every single day
about maintaining the specialist support
and care that my older daughter who has
autism depends upon and listening to my
friend from Iceland
I felt knackered I felt exhausted
I felt the exhaustion that so many women
feel from getting up every day and
building bridges between themselves and
the people they love and the rest of the
world with no support it doesn&#39;t have to
be this way women have been
discriminated against for all of the
history of our country denied the right
to vote denied an education denied the
right to own property until 1920 now
those laws are passed but that history
is still with us women are still the
poorest people in the country two-thirds
of the work of this country&#39;s first
people are women women are still the
single biggest underrepresented group in
this country women work hard all their
lives and for what an austerity policy
that doesn&#39;t see them that taxes them
disproportionately a hike in their
retirement age that takes no account of
the years and years of unpaid care work
that they had to do we can change this
next year marks the centenary that women
got the right to vote that first tranche
of women small group over the age of 30
white property owners we do not have to
take the inequalities of the past into
our future we can bridge that gap if we
start to rethink the kind of bridges
that we want to build thank you very
much
you
[Applause]
