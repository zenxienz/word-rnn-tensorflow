so who here has an older sibling my
brother and I used to play a lot of
video games together we would go to
school run back home as fast as we can
turn on the Nintendo 64 and either play
pokemon or Super Mario Brothers and we
would be lost in this world playing for
hours and hours on end now if you have
an older brother and you&#39;re playing a
video game with one controller what
usually ends up happening is he plays
well you kind of get to watch now funny
enough I actually enjoyed this whole
paradigm where I was watching him
playing the game then actually playing
the game so this whole process of being
the observer followed me throughout my
life a few years later a bunch of
misfits and I got together and we
started this whole process of recording
and telling stories now we weren&#39;t
particularly good at it we were
basically just getting together and
playing video games but as time went on
we started to build a following
we got about 600 different people to
watch us play video games in 20
different countries and we raked up
millions and millions of views now we
weren&#39;t particularly good at what we
were doing trust me you can find those
videos online and I urge you not to as
time went on this team of misfits later
turned into a company where we work with
businesses all around the world telling
great powerful stories and I am here
today telling you guys
why content matters now more than ever
this world is a very fascinating place
we have about seven and a half billion
people that&#39;s an insanely difficult
number to wrap your head around but the
numbers get more interesting
if you look at it half of the world at
least close to that by now is connected
it&#39;s connected in one way shape or form
whether you&#39;re connected to the Internet
through a cell phone a tablet a PC or
any device we have half of the world
hooked together now what&#39;s interesting
is not the fact that we have over three
billion people connected to the Internet
we have over two billion people
connected to one single platform
Facebook a decade ago if you were to go
ahead and say hey look we&#39;re gonna have
this ecosystem where there&#39;s 2 billion
people in one setting they think you&#39;re
absolutely nuts and this causes so much
content to be created that as of today
there is over a billion hours of video
being uploaded to YouTube every single
day that&#39;s a hundred and fifteen years
of content and a lot of cat videos so
what does this mean anyway what is
content why does it matter and why does
it matter now as opposed to any other
time this what you see behind me is a
studio setting I&#39;m sure some of you may
know what that is it&#39;s very famous and
you would get together with your friends
and family and you would sit down and
watch how it used to happen was this is
probably like a thirty minute piece of
content it&#39;s a video with directors
cameramen studios lights and the works
and you would sit around and you&#39;d enjoy
watching this now there&#39;s nothing wrong
with that but what started happening was
that started changing it started
changing slowly then really quickly
because content has always been moving
from platform to platform it&#39;s been
revolutionising since the day we had the
newspapers and we jumped onto radio and
from radio to television and people
naturally assumed okay he&#39;s on radio
what&#39;s going to end up happy he&#39;s on
what&#39;s gonna end up happening is that
this content is going to stay the same
and we&#39;re simply going to switch mediums
to something like Netflix or any other
streaming site you&#39;d assume that you&#39;d
watch the same content in a different
setting that makes it easier for you to
understand and easier for you to cook
digest and just more sophisticated it&#39;s
easier to access but what&#39;s happening is
something slightly different it&#39;s not
that the platform you consume is
changing but the content itself years
ago you had these companies and I mean
still today you have this company
spending millions of dollars on this but
they&#39;re only competing for one thing and
that&#39;s attention and it&#39;s not attention
of anyone else it&#39;s the attention of you
and I as content creators these big
marketing companies these media machines
and powerhouses are no longer competing
against themselves to get the attention
of the people but they&#39;re content
they&#39;re simply fighting against you and
I they&#39;re fighting against your uncle
who is taking way too many pictures of
their kids and uploading it on Facebook
they&#39;re fighting against your co-workers
that&#39;s going on exotic trips and posting
that on Instagram that&#39;s what they&#39;re
fighting against if I tell you and ask
you who is the biggest persona person
celebrity online you would assume that
it&#39;s a corporately owned popstar or some
sort of musician or singer or a less
Liberty but that&#39;s not the case if you
take something like YouTube the most
viewed personality on YouTube isn&#39;t a
singer you&#39;d assume it&#39;s someone like
Justin Bieber or Rihanna because a lot
of people go to YouTube to watch music
it&#39;s actually a guy that plays video
games
it&#39;s a weird guy who plays video games
in Sweden and his name is PewDiePie his
real name&#39;s Felix but really no one
knows about that he&#39;s called PewDiePie
and he plays a lot of video games he&#39;s
not particularly good at it
if you&#39;ve seen his content but this guy
has his content viewed over 16 billion
times that&#39;s more than Justin Bieber and
Rihanna put together now the reason that
his content is viewed so much isn&#39;t
because of anything else but because
it&#39;s relatable because he&#39;s just like
you and me and because you can relate to
him you can trust him I&#39;ll give you
another example this is Salman Khan no
no no not that Salman Khan the other one
have any of you guys heard of Khan
Academy so there is this guy that wanted
to teach his niece maths and science now
he&#39;s not an educator he just couldn&#39;t be
bothered to go in and tutor him day in
and day out so what he decided to do was
start teaching and recording all of this
and putting it up on YouTube funny
enough a lot of people started watching
his videos because they could understand
what he was saying
small 20 minute videos of Education now
he&#39;s not a teacher or a licensed
educator in any way shape or form
he just creates a lot of content right
now Khan Academy has served over half a
billion lessons to close to a hundred
million students across the world now
all of these stories are fascinating
right but how does it affect people how
can you actually use content so we run a
digital marketing company and it&#39;s
really hard to find talent because the
society hasn&#39;t caught up in terms of
Education we&#39;re using new technologies
that isn&#39;t available so we literally
have to go out there and hunt for talent
so the team got together and decided you
know what our guys are natively on these
platforms they spent the overwhelming
majority of their life on Instagram and
snapchat so why not look there
personally I took this as a challenge
and I started recording every waking
moment of my life
people who know me might not like this
and it becomes very intrusive at times
but I started recording going to
meetings meeting up with friends working

till 3:00 in the morning getting drunk
every single part of our existence was
recorded and put up on the internet for
everyone to see for those of you who
don&#39;t know what an Instagram story is
it&#39;s a small video it&#39;s 15 seconds and
it explodes after a day what I mean by
that is that if you don&#39;t look at it in
24 hours you will never see it again
what we started noticing was that we
started building a following of
entrepreneurs of markers of students of
people that just wanted to know what was
going on and after a while they started
messaging us they said hey look I love
what you guys are doing I I don&#39;t really
know what you guys are doing but I like
it
can I be a part of this and we figured
you know what why not as of today our
business only hires people through
Instagram stories I mean if anyone in
the crowd is looking for a job in
marketing hit me up on Instagram if you
guys have noticed there is this one
video in particular we did the story
specifically for TEDx it was basically
saying hey look we&#39;re having this event
why don&#39;t you guys show up and this
video was seen over a hundred thousand
times in Colombo and looking by the
crowd here I think it worked it&#39;s not
just this we I mean our marketing
company was kind of established we had a
following so we figured how do you make
it more attractive how do you use the
problem of content and storytelling to
fill bigger shoes and to solve bigger
problems we started a accounting firm
for fun now if you guys know about
anything about accounting is that
accounting is not sexy at all and we
don&#39;t know jack-shit about accounting
but we wanted to sell it and accounting
is a very specific type of business
which
is very commoditized it&#39;s really hard to
be good at accounting because everyone&#39;s
good at accounting if you&#39;re in it and
you really can&#39;t specialize you can&#39;t be
cheaper because that&#39;s a whole other
problem and we wanted to approach this
problem differently what we said was
okay we found out that there were a lot
of people trying to set up businesses in
this country the startup economy was
booming but there was a lot of
misinformation they were behind red tape
and closed doors because it always
helped someone else&#39;s agenda if no one
knew about how this process worked so we
figured okay so we know this problem why
don&#39;t we go ahead and share it why don&#39;t
we tell every single person that we know
how we do these things for free seemed
like a pretty good idea at the time so
we started writing about it we started
writing about how to register businesses
how to search build sole proprietorships
what are the laws that you need to
understand how do you find your
co-founders tax laws EPF s-- ETF&#39;s all
of the legal jargon simplified so that
people like you and I can understand
trust me I don&#39;t know anything about
accounting and if any one of you guys
have looked at my books you would know
that&#39;s true so this concept of telling
the story and letting people know and
being absolutely transparent worked
wonders right now our accounting firm is
the single largest company in the
country that registers businesses and
all of this is happening because we
decided to tell that story what I&#39;m
trying to get at is a very simple
message it&#39;s not complicated it&#39;s very
simple you need to understand that
everyone should create content it
doesn&#39;t really matter who you are or
what you do you can be a rocket
scientist you can be a gardener or you
can be a dropout like me but you need to
tell that story so that every single
person knows because what&#39;s happening in
this society
is not that you have a degree or
qualification to say that you&#39;re good at
something what&#39;s happening is that
people tend to trust transparency and
individuality over something else it&#39;s
no longer the degrees you hold it&#39;s now
the stories you tell because no one is
really looking for an expert opinion
anymore people that are looking at your
content understand that you haven&#39;t
figured it all out yet and that&#39;s okay
but what they want to know is that you
are in the process of figuring it out
and they&#39;d be more than happy to tag
along they&#39;d be happy to hear your story
because it&#39;s different and they want to
follow you in your journey so I urge you
I implore you
starting today whether it&#39;s simply
picking up your phone and taking a
picture or writing a blog it doesn&#39;t
matter where your content goes worry
about that later find out where your
audience is and start telling your story
whether it&#39;s just whether you already
have a company and you have to tell it
your employees or you&#39;re just starting
someone it&#39;s just starting with
something and the only person that&#39;s
willing to listen to you is your mother
go out there and tell a story like I
just did
telling mine hope you guys enjoyed
