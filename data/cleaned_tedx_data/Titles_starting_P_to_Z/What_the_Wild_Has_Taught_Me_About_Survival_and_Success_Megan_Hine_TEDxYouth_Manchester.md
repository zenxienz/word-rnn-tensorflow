who creates the monsters under our beds
who tears us down who stops us doing the
things we love doing who creates the
stumbling blocks that trip us over and
over again we do we&#39;re our own worst
critics we cause dramas where there are
none and instead of stead of celebrating
our successes we criticize ourselves for
the things that we didn&#39;t do perfectly
why is this because we&#39;re afraid and
it&#39;s far easier to stay hidden behind
the sofa than it is to come out and face
the demons that are often just figments
of our own imagination in the wilderness
I have seen fear bend and break people
but I&#39;ve also seen unexpected heroes
rise people who found the courage and
the ability to overcome their fear and
achieve a goal summiting a Himalayan
peak or surviving for weeks on end in
the jungle what if I told you that just
like these people you too could become
the hero of your own life I&#39;m a
survivalist a wilderness guide i guide
private expeditions to some of the
world&#39;s most exciting environments I&#39;m
also partly responsible for setting up
and running the safety on some of the
biggest adventure shows on TV I&#39;ve
literally been dropped into environments
with just the clothes I&#39;m standing in
and a knife or a machete and a medical
pack just in case and had to look after
contributors in these environments at
times I&#39;ll hunt and gather and trap for
them and meet their basic priorities of
survival fire food shelter and water
it&#39;s incredible in these situations that
stepping off into that world is just
amazing I&#39;ve been shot at I&#39;ve been
chased by large predators like huge
animals I&#39;ve been caught in the
crossfire between warring tribes have
been avalanched and many more exciting
situations I know the power fear holds
over us I also know that incredible
feeling when you overcome it
so what is fear fear is actually pretty
cool it&#39;s a survival mechanism it&#39;s what
keeps us alive if we didn&#39;t feel fear we
wouldn&#39;t survive very long it allows us
to understand risk and Heights for
example if we didn&#39;t understand the risk
of heights I mean we just go merrily
wandering off the edges of these cliffs
and fall to our death the human species
would not last very long in these
situations the problem is that I&#39;ve seen
is the fear and anxiety are becoming
chronic conditions in everyday life it
seems like that animalistic brain which
to our ancestors helped them stay alive
like fear readied their bodies to run or
hide
you know if they wandered off by
themselves they might get lost yeah they
were safer as a community or being
stalked by a large predator like a
saber-toothed tiger no fear kept them
alive but what I realized so from
working and guiding people in the
wilderness is that the brain struggles
to differentiate between these real life
and death threats versus for example
giving a TED talk or scary movie or this
fear of missing out yeah the fear of
missing out it&#39;s becoming a huge issue
it&#39;s a very real issue as well it&#39;s that
feeling that somebody&#39;s got better
something better than you or know
something more than you do or they&#39;re
living a better life in you and this is
where social media plays to this fear
you know we all have that horrible
knotted feeling when we see these
perfect pictures of our friends lives on
social media it&#39;s that kind of itch you
can&#39;t quite scratch yeah it&#39;s the first
thing maybe you look at in the morning
is your Facebook feed see how many likes
you&#39;ve got to see how many likes your
friends have got in comparison you know
it might be the last thing you do at
night before you go to bed as well even
though you don&#39;t really want to do it
and you know that it has an impact on
you so what happens to the body when we
experience fear and we all know this we
all have this feeling it&#39;s that feeling
when somebody jumps out on you when the
brain is under threat this hole is
chained area
action goes off inside there and it
triggers the release of hormones such as
adrenaline and cortisol and these go
rushing around the body like when
somebody jumps out on you you all get
that feeling and this goes rush man&#39;s
body and it&#39;s triggers it makes your
heart beat you faster it sends the blood
rushing to the muscles ready to run or
fight it gets your body ready for those
situations and this is why you sometimes
you get those subtle tonal vision as
well which kind of makes it hard to
focus on things that&#39;s all blurriness at
the edge of you edges of your vision
once the threat is over the
parasympathetic nervous system kicks in
and calms the body down the problem is
going back to the issue that&#39;s you know
that it&#39;s now becoming a chronic
condition is that the brain struggles to
switch itself off you know we&#39;re
bombarded with these social media images
why you know so overwhelming everyday
life as which brainless I said Kant
struggles to distinguish between the
real life and death versus this fear of
missing out and the brain stays switched
on you know it keeps releasing those
hormones and we get these chronic
conditions starting and you know there&#39;s
conditions that have been related to
stress things like autoimmune diseases
gluten intolerance is even things like
acne and depression these are all linked
potentially back to stress so how do we
learn to control this and become the
hero of our own lives stop stop
think observe plan when I&#39;m teaching
survival skills I teach the rule of
threes which is based on the American
military training system which is a
generalized rule of survival it
basically says that in general the human
body can survive three minutes without
air three days without water three weeks
without food I tend to add two more to
this the first one is three months
without company
we&#39;re tribes people were designed to
live as a community you know we need
other people otherwise we tend to go
what old-time fur trappers would call
going bushy which is where we go a
little bit mad
from spending too much time alone and
the second one is three seconds without
thinking I see this over and over again
in dangerous environments where people
switch off their brain for threes for a
few seconds and this is when accidents
happen this is why more accidents happen
on the way down from an epic summit than
on the way up the Mountaineer has
achieved their goal that mountain has
been playing in their mind for days
weeks months potentially even years and
they&#39;ve reached that goal
weirdly returning home safe or returning
back to base camp is rarely the driving
factor I had a guy in an Arctic
expedition it was working and minus 50
chill factor up there and he was he was
chopping some wood with an axe and he
was busy he sort of cutting away and
stuck the axe in his foot which
triggered a 12-hour evacuation to get
him out of there but this and in
hindsight what he told me was that he&#39;d
he&#39;d got distracted by these snow flakes
he&#39;s beautiful snowflakes falling onto
his sleeve this just goes to show that
even when you&#39;re doing something really
dangerous the mind wanders and switches
off when I&#39;m teaching navigation I used
that a stop acronym that stop think
observe and plan and when when working
with Duke venema groups or beginner
navigators I always encouraged them that
if they become geographically
embarrassed is to stop and brew
themselves a cup of tea or coffee and
have a drink I find that in this in this
time when they can actually calm their
bodies down and they go through that
process of brewing their drink and
having it it gives the brain time to
calm back down and logical reasoning
kicks back in which prevents them from
becoming even more geographically
embarrassed and wandering off into the
wilderness where we don&#39;t have to go
looking for them I recently read a
newspaper article when I was out in the
US about a hiker whose body had recently
been found after several
years of being missing next to her body
they found a journal that said that she
had she&#39;d wandered off the path to go to
the toilet and on finishing her business
she couldn&#39;t find her path again now I
don&#39;t know this hiker and I don&#39;t know
the full circumstances so this is by no
means a judgment of her but imagine
yourselves in that position imagine that
you&#39;ve been hiking off in the wilderness
and you&#39;ve wandered off the path to go
to the toilet realistically how far away
are you from that path 50 foot 100 foot
it&#39;s not very far you finish your
business pull your trousers up you go
wandering off after a couple of minutes
of walking you realize that you&#39;ve
missed your path it&#39;s in that moment
that fear strikes you&#39;re genuinely at
risk you know they&#39;re you out in the
middle of nowhere you on your own you&#39;ve
got no mobile phone signal it&#39;s in this
moment where that fear strikes that rush
of adrenaline that goes through the body
and where this reflex action occurs
which for some people maybe freeze but
for others it&#39;s like running around like
a headless chicken so wildly out of
control but it&#39;s in that moment where
it&#39;s key to become the hair of your life
and stop stop there get out your GPS
your compass your map allow the brain to
calm back down again before you then act
this will allow the brain time to
actually come up with a logical plan
which might be that you then do logical
sequence of searching which will then
put you back onto your path so how do
you train the hero and how do you stay
switched on so I use a technique or
scenario planning and for me scenario
planning is has several different sort
of factors I realized when I woke my
book mind was fiber that resilience can
be trained
you know the traits that make up
resilience can be trained and anybody
can learn them some people are more
predisposed to them but other but
anybody can learn these things and the
way that you do that is through exposure
to lots of different experiences so when
those up
Unity&#39;s arise say yes more push
yourselves out of your comfort zone more
you know facing more challenges allow
gives yourself self-confidence and more
confidence to faith life head-on and
succeed the second one is this is that
with the scenario planning is that I is
something that I do all the time when
I&#39;m guiding it&#39;s like I&#39;m wandering
along the paths and I&#39;ll be imagining in
my clients worn off how am I going to
rescue them how am I going to save them
you know down to downright CRAZY things
like what would I do if an alien
spaceship fell out sky right in front of
me and this has to gives me two reasons
for doing this the first one is that it
keeps my brain switched on it keeps it
active when I&#39;ve been guiding for weeks
on end out in the jungle I&#39;m covered in
mosquito bites I&#39;m itchy I&#39;m tired yeah
I need to keep my brain switched on and
this keeps my brain ready and prepared
for the unexpected and the second reason
that I do this is so that I&#39;m tricking
my mind similar to the visualization
process that athletes use I&#39;m tricking
my brain into believing that I&#39;ve done
this time and time again before so you
take these things and use them in
everyday life it&#39;s not wrong to imagine
yourself as the hair of your life run it
through in your head yeah and the next
time that incredible opportunity comes
up that you might have turned down
before because you were scared will give
you the confidence because your brain
thinks it&#39;s already done it before so as
you guys go onto the next stage of life
and into the future
ask yourself these questions who has the
power of change who allows us to feel
the happiness we deserve and who holds
the key to your future thank you
you
