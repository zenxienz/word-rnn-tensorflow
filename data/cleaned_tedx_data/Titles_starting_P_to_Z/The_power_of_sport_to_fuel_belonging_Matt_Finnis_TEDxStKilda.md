did you know that 1 in 27 Australians
are members of an AFL club one in 27 and
when I say member I don&#39;t mean to
someone who just buys a season&#39;s ticket
or a ticket for a match or watches the
game on TV I&#39;m talking about someone who
is a shared owner of their football club
now this fierce loyalty is at its
highest here in Melbourne where on any
given weekend in winter time you can see
thousands of people and families draped
in the colours of their teams heading to
these Coliseum&#39;s to watch a live game
and whether they&#39;re a new family who&#39;s
arrived from Mumbai and I&#39;m going to top
the Essen bombers as their team or
they&#39;ve grown up in working-class North
Melbourne and for them it&#39;s the
Kangaroos one of the things they all
have in common is their love of AFL and
the love of their team so what is it
about this game in these clubs which
drives this enormous sense of connection
and tribalism is it the thrill of the
contest the opportunity to see amazing
athletes performing incredible acts of
physical courage and bravery or just the
thrill of winged well of course it&#39;s all
these things but it&#39;s also much much
more and my team our team listened cured
a football club
is living proof of the ability of our
sporting tribes to transform communities
through the power of belonging my name
is Matt finis and I never played AFL
on the ground Colosseum in front of
hundreds of thousands of people I wasn&#39;t
a great kick
indeed now I&#39;m just one of the suits who
along with the orange peelers and the
cheer squad sit on the sidelines of our
great game but over the last few years
I&#39;ve had the privilege to play a very
small role in quite an inspiring journey
of discovery which is a journey worth
sharing
now the origins of a strain rules
football have been hotly debated but can
be traced generally back to Indigenous
Australians playing a game called man
Brook and has subsequently been passed
on from generations and played on
suburban and country ovals around the
country fiercely egalitarian our game
and whilst it&#39;s often been the great
distractor leave your worries and
anxieties at home and go to the footy
it&#39;s also being the stage from time to
time upon which much of our nation&#39;s
social dialogue has played out and so
you know it&#39;s not without its politics
indeed
that moment back in 1993 when Nicky we&#39;d
mal lifted his jumper and point to the
calories skin it remains one of the most
enduring images of Australian sport and
race in our history now the mighty
Saints were born right here in some
killed over 140 years ago and it&#39;s fair
to say that over that time winning
Premiership cups hasn&#39;t been our strong
suit it was back in 1966 when we won our
first and only Premiership Cup
unfortunately back in 1966 there was
this tradition of the opposing players
swapping jumpers with each other after
the game so even our Premiership
photograph album has our Premiership
heroes wearing the jumpers of the
Magpies
[Laughter]
but I can tell you that right now
everyone it&#39;s in Kilda is firmly focused
on securing a second piece of silverware
for our trophy cabinet when our players
think about making our people proud they
think about returning to their home with
a premiership cup on behalf of hundreds
and thousands of some Kilda supporters
but they also know that they can&#39;t win a
premiership every year let alone every
month or every week so they&#39;ve developed
a plan to engender pride in the way they
go about playing and training and living
on a weekly basis and whether it&#39;s
playing with pride or playing for pride
this intangible sentiment has become
such an important ingredient of our
sense of purpose in our footy club that
it&#39;s worth actually stepping back and
exploring just some of that journey just
before I arrived at some Kilda back in
2014 I discovered that a marketing
agency had been confirmed by the club to
overhaul the brand create a new logo on
an advertising campaign and in a rare
moment of clarity I remember thinking
hang on a second our identity is not a
marketing exercise the last thing we
need is a new logo but we certainly need
to get a better sense of ourselves and
critically our relationship with our
community since Kilda was born in a
unique part of Melbourne this melting
pot of humanity which is really grounded
yet aspirational and in his brightest
moments everyone is welcome to be
themselves it&#39;s in Cuba we&#39;re rock stars
rubbed shoulders with the homeless and
neither is out of place it&#39;s no
coincidence that the annual celebration
of sexual diversity in this state one of
the most culturally diverse cities in
Australia is a march down the Main
Street of some Kilda
as we listen to the stories of our fans
now members our coaches and our players
and we connected the dots between this
place which gave birth to our footy club
all those years ago and what we are
today we actually discovered a
disconnect that was sitting right before
our eyes and pretty conveniently ignored
we discovered a section of our community
which felt welcome to be themselves in
some cool to the suburb but not when
they were supporting it&#39;s in cured of
the club we discovered a section of our
community that felt safer to be
themselves on the streets than they did
in the stadiums now by coincidence at
the same time as we were having this
conversation
a small Football Club in country
Victoria started a conversation which is
to be honest being taboo in country
towns let alone footie clubs for years
when Yarra Glen Jason ball came out and
spoke openly about his homosexuality his
footy club decided to change the color
of their jumper to take a stand against
homophobia and wrap their arms around
Jason when that footy club decided to
have a conversation to address prejudice
and stereotypes which had existed for
generations some Keota was inspired into
action if a country footy town can have
that conversation and make such a
difference in their community what could
we do on a national basis imagine if we
could stage a game attended by tens of
thousands of people watched by hundreds
of thousands if not millions more where
we laid out the welcome mat and sent the
most powerful message to the LGBTI
community you&#39;re welcome at the footie
well we knew this was the right thing to
do and we knew that we were the club to
do it but we also knew that get it wrong
and you can cause more damage than good
so we embarked on a two-year journey of
discovery which ultimately made us a
much richer place for what it is that we
learned we met with politicians and
activists media commentators community
organisations who were really keen to
help us to help them to belong in sport
we surveyed our members to get a sense
of their attitudes we marched with our
coaches and our players and our staff
with the LGBTI community and some Kilda
and we did education sessions as well
because for too long
language like proof homo faggot have
been all too commonly used in our game
and along the way we met some of the
most inspiring people who were so giving
of their wisdom and their courage to
join us in our journey but we also
learned that some of our fans resented
their footy club having this
conversation so we did receive some hate
mail the occasional cut up membership
and we also received flyers distributed
by anti-marriage equality campaigners
urging people to boycott our game it&#39;s
funny but our club got a bit of an
insight into what it would be like to be
on the wrong side of homophobia now we
were certainly troubled by this but I&#39;ve
got to say there was more than a few
sleepless nights but we were far more
encouraged by these heartwarming
messages of support that we received
from Saints fans and fans of other clubs
who all of a sudden saw an opportunity
for change and who would have thought
that over 20 years on since Niki win ma
lifted up his jumper that he would start
a new conversation about discrimination
and Prejudice when he and his gay son
tine and shared the story
of an Aboriginal father sporting hero
and his estranged son growing up in
Ballarat who would have thought that by
simply painting the rainbow colors on
our ground and changing the colours
likewise of our goal umpires flags that
we would send such a powerful message of
inclusion that it would encourage people
to come to the football when they&#39;d
never been before
who would afford that&#39;s the simple act
of our coaches and players sending
messages of welcome would have such an
impact that a Saints fan would come to
the stadium and marching to see his team
holding his male partners hand for the
first time who would have thought
[Applause]
[Applause]
colors of the rifles and spices not
every owner is a gram the primeira one
by college it really is priceless she
began for the iPhone
[Applause]
[Applause]
now it&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s been over
a year since the first ever pride game
in world sport was staged in Melbourne
on that winter&#39;s night a whole nother
season has been running one including a
second pride game which we took to
Sydney this year to lad the welcome mat
to a whole new community of LGBTI fans
and there were news stories this year
too but now we can week out when we go
to the footy we see these symbols of
Pride and inclusion in the scarves and
the beanies and the flags which are
there week in week out and these symbols
of pride remind us as a fully Club that
our community is proud of what we&#39;re
doing and our players can draw upon that
pride as strengths to deliver that
second premise ship back for the Saints
and fuel a contagious sense of belonging
for everyone thank you
[Applause]
