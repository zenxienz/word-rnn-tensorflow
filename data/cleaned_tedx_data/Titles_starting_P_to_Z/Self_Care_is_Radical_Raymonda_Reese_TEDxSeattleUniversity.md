so this noise that is the lid rate that
explains was that stressful yes no a
little bit that noise especially the
police sirens can be more or less
stressful for some folks and rightly so
I mean stress is normal but healthily
responding to stress is critical I&#39;m a
psychotherapist working here in a
Seattle area and in my practice I
primarily work with youth of color and
with our current political schism people
are stressed yes even our youth are
extremely stressed and rightly so every
day we are met with a barrage of
stressors so commuting to work or for
instance being stuck in traffic or
having to fit a really important
exercise regimen in to move our bodies
or we might have an assignment that we
need to complete so whether it be for
work or for school all of these are
stressors that we often experience and
they can leave us quite depleted so what
we know though is actually stress is
normal and there are two types of stress
so you stress and distress do people
know that two types
I know I learned this - so you stress is
a positive stress so this is the stress
of getting on a roller coaster all that
excitement or have
challenging but really manageable work
assignments to complete so that&#39;s you
stress these stress on the other hand is
negative stress so these are the little
stresses we experience everyday or
stressors that can be traumatic over
time so the death of a loved one or an
illness that may leave us incapacitated
these are all things that can lead to
very traumatic and negative stress and
overtime these are some of the things
that we can experience and they can
leave us leaving feeling like this
so headaches nausea panic attacks right
these are all things that I&#39;m sure some
of us have experienced dealing with
stress so as I&#39;m sure all of you can
also name there are some groups or some
experiences or some identities that it
may experience more stress right so
women for instance or people of color
with the many discrimination that
happens throughout our daily lives these
are all groups that may experience more
stress so for instance how would a young
latina mother and student be experienced
in life what are her challenges what are
her stressors how may a young newly
immigrated primary student be
experiencing life what are her
challenges so in my practice I had the
pleasure of meeting Sasha it&#39;s not a row
name but it is an ode to Beyonce so I
met Sasha and I guys got a happy on stay
with me and she was this vibrant
fifteen-year-old young lady and I could
see that she was smart she was spunky
she was engaged but as we&#39;ve heard today
she was struggling as a student she was
challenged she could not complete our
assignments and as I was talking to her
more I learned that she couldn&#39;t sleep
at night you know she felt really down
right you start to really uncover some
things and as I was speaking to her we
spoke a lot about self-care right which
is very popular and very cool and very
current and so we talked a lot about how
self-care was radical right and that was
something that I love to discuss caring
for ourselves which is very very
important but as I was speaking to Sasha
it became pretty apparent to me that the
singular experience that she was having
was actually completely connected to her
community so as I spoke to her more we
arrived here community care is radical
and community care was radical in
particular for Sasha because there was
not any hospitals an area there was not
a job in which her mother could be
adequately compensated in her
neighborhood there was not a local
program or after-school program or
resource center for the young people so
truly it was impossible for Sasha to
ever reach the limit or to peak in
self-care because our community had not
received the care needed so community
care is radical for two reasons the
first reason is especially as Americans
or people who live within the US we are
taught to be individualistic in our
pursuits community care takes into
consideration the person as a part of
the whole
the second reason community care in
particular is radical is because it
allows vulnerable populations to receive
the resources and care that they deserve
and need so community care looks like
these three things for me in my practice
this is what I learned
awareness affirmation and access so
awareness what is happening in my life
how am I
connected to my community how am i
impacted by the macro mezzo and micro
decisions that are made about my life
how are we all politically connected
socially connected emotionally connected
so being able to have an awareness about
where we situate ourselves okay the
second thing was affirmation so
affirming that we are all having this
experience that may leave us broken that
may leave us also in positive situations
but being able to have a conversation
especially with my young people
affirming and telling them that their
experience matters and it&#39;s important
and then access so I spoke a little bit
about this but resources what is
available to our youth what kind of
education are they receiving what sort
of hospital and medical benefits are
they able to acquire these are all
really important things to consider when
we think not just of self care but how
it can be more radical in community care
the great poet scholar activist Audrey
Lorde said caring for myself is not
self-indulgence it is self preservation
and that is an act of political warfare
so to close I would like to actually
read a piece written by me and it is
titled
a letter to my folks
hey uh you know our parents our
grandparents our ancestors how
uncompromising how astute talented we&#39;re
here we survived some of us not enough
have thrived how grand how deserving and
with this at our backdrop I want to
remind us as we move forward we don&#39;t
have to be burdened we don&#39;t have to be
limiting in our vision for ourselves our
communities our people our world we can
be radical and kind and complex we can
build strong ethical loving families
relationships leadership&#39;s communities
governments were here we&#39;re ready we&#39;re
survived we&#39;re talented
we&#39;re multi-dimensional we will continue
to rise we will continue to nurture
ourselves our communities our offspring
for what else do we know so we must dig
deep cover one another build with our
vulnerable neighbors we can be radical
we can take care in solidarity
you
