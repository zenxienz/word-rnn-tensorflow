so what are these things what do you see
here this looks like those shelves you
were making this part of that project
that was supposed to take six hours and
six months later it&#39;s still unfinished
and sitting in the corner these
leftovers from that honey do list you
had but personally when I see these
things I don&#39;t see projects like that in
fact I don&#39;t see anything at all I hear
but I&#39;m jumping ahead I&#39;m a sound
designer I create and manipulate audio
for commercials film TV video games plus
I&#39;m a percussionist now I know that
makes me incredibly noisy and I&#39;m sure I
Drive those closest to me nuts
with the constant tapping and all the
times I have to ever to be real quiet so
I can record some mechanical whirr or
buzz that I happen to find interesting
but selfishly I know this is a beautiful
union of disciplines as a sound designer
I&#39;m in a constant pursuit of new sounds
I carry a recorder with me wherever I go
whether I&#39;m riding the train riding in a
car you know when you travel you sample
the local fare and take in the sights me
I do the same things but I also sample
the local sounds of the city I&#39;m in and
then head to the beach and catch some
waves with my microphones but one of my
favorite places to hunt for sounds is
the Home Depot now what I&#39;m about to
tell you is a warning never ever go with
me to a hardware store
unless you don&#39;t mind listening to
someone tap on everything seriously I&#39;ll
go into the pain aisle and tap on every
paint can creating little paint can
melodies like this latex paint that
sounds pretty cool
not only that it&#39;s fast drying it&#39;s
indoor and it&#39;s durable enough for
outdoor and it&#39;s ideal for wood metal
jazz and blues and then you have these
little cans of stain that sounds even
cooler and thick but the difference yes
the cans smaller but the consistency of
the stain is thinner so I&#39;m able to
change the pitch more quickly then that
lumbering latex over there
lumber that&#39;s another great aisle to
prowl let&#39;s take a listen to some of
this wood that sounds amazing there&#39;s
nothing special about this wood
[Applause]
these two pieces I bought about a month
ago prepping for this talk these three
were one piece a week and a half ago and
I made two random cuts and then you have
the hardware aisle with the little
pieces of metal the nails and screws
nails in a plastic container the perfect
shaker
I was playing all these individual
components and it struck me what if I
put them together and that idea led to
this what is it it&#39;s a percussion
instrument I created called the nether
box everything to make the nether box
came from Home Depot it&#39;s red oak that I
made into a box mounted threaded rods
and Springs across the top the threaded
rods come in long links and I cut them
to different sizes to achieve different
pitches the springs are stretched across
the top and vibrate sympathetically to
the strikes on the rods some rods are
high pitched and some like my personal
favorite which I have nicknamed the god
note are low
one more time I find it amazing that a
threaded rod bought at Home Depot
mounted on this red oak box that I
created can produce such low frequencies
that literally shakes this room I don&#39;t
know about you but when I hear and feel
this that makes me smile now I can
change the timbre of the box depending
on what kind of striker or stick I use a
soft mallet or when I play in the nether
box my stick a choice the bamboo skewer
I can use my fingers I can even use my
fingernails the springs act as
resonators and help sustain the notes on
the box or I can just hit them this is a
percussionist Rin right so what do I do
with the nether box well I make music
and sounds with it sometimes those
sounds are soft and chiming
and other times they&#39;re downright
demonic
[Music]
the nether box has a seemingly infinite
range of tones and sounds that you can
make from a depending on how you play it
and what you choose to play it with
sometimes it can remind you of another
instrument but it truly has a unique
voice all its own
