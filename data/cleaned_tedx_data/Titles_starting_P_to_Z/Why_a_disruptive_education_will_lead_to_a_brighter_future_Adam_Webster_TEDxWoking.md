all right good afternoon everybody um I
think it&#39;s a fairly well established
truth that the education system is built
upon a Victorian foundation and Charles
Dickens over 160 years ago recognized
even then that it was a flawed system
and I think it&#39;s interesting that
despite the fact he was one of the
greatest social commentators of his age
we have largely ignored the warnings
he&#39;s given in a number of places
including in the opening of one of his
novels hard times I&#39;m just going to read
you the opening paragraph that in mind
as I read now what I want its facts
teach these boys and girls nothing but
facts facts alone are wanted in life
plants nothing else and root out
everything else you can only form the
minds of reasoning animals upon facts
nothing else will ever be of any service
to them this is the principle on which I
bring up my own children and this is the
principle on which I bring up these
children stick to facts sir so as mr.
Gradgrind points out the education
system is built upon a very specific
measurable kind of success which today
we see as being the exam system I think
what&#39;s interesting is that despite the
passing of time that system hasn&#39;t
softened at all in fact it&#39;s probably
hardened to the point where our young
people teachers and parents have never
been more anxious about succeeding
against this very specific criteria I
think that there&#39;s very much an
individual teacher or
an individual school can do to fight
against that system at the moment
perhaps the one thing it can do is make
a conscious decision to shift its focus
I remember reading about disruptive
thinking about a year or so into my
teaching career and the example given
was of the fizzy drinks industry and it
said that the fizzy drinks industry is
built upon store 3 amove herbal pillars
that a drink has to be tasty it should
be cheap and it should be sold with a
kind of carefree fun lifestyle attached
to it
I sort of thought about the many fizzy
drinks I&#39;ve consumed over the years and
ticked those off repeatedly and agreed
that that seemed about right now
disruptive thinking aims to flip an
industry on its head so if you take that
to its ultimate conclusion it means
we&#39;re looking for a drink that might not
be concerned with being tasty it could
be expensive and it sells a lifestyle
that might be something like functional
and I was wondering how on earth that
could be a formula for success and it
get to the end of the article and it
reveals the product and the product was
Red Bull my mind was blown about how how
clever they had been in in subverting a
really well-established industry now
innovation doesn&#39;t have to be as
disruptive as that example but if you
look at the great examples often
disruption plays a role think about
pretty much anything james dyson has
invented you know a vacuum cleaning
without a bag I think my mum&#39;s mind was
blown when she saw that for the first
time you know a fan that doesn&#39;t have
blades and these are things that are
really unsettling when you first sort of
hear about them and see them but
ultimately they&#39;re really successful
examples of disruption and innovation so
what can a school do to innovate and be
disruptive well I think it needs to ask
itself the most fundamental of questions
what is a school for so if a school
isn&#39;t going to be about passing exams
what&#39;s it going to be for if it&#39;s not a
place where you go to get filled up with
facts what&#39;s it going to do
so what if a school were a place that
celebrated creativity above everything
else what if a school were a place where
the curriculum bent around the needs and
the desires and motivations of the young
people that walked through its doors
what if a school were a place where the
teachers weren&#39;t the ones with all the
knowledge would that be like and what
about what about if a school was
somewhere that actually felt relevant to
the young people that came in every day
it wouldn&#39;t that be an interesting thing
now there&#39;s no denying that facts are a
really important part of Education you
know and without facts lots of things
don&#39;t make sense science basically would
go off the timetable
you know facts and rules are a
fundamentally important part of life
because if you don&#39;t know facts and
rules you don&#39;t know what to challenge
you don&#39;t know what to change and you
don&#39;t know when to break them you know
but beyond all of that you know we&#39;ve
got to be teaching them transferable
skills because if you consider the
average child starts education in this
country at four years old
okay and they leave at the earliest at
sixteen and you know sometimes
significantly after that so that&#39;s a
minimum of 12 years in education so
consider that 12 years ago there was no
such thing as an iPhone but today you
could walk around the corner and buy an
iPhone that unlocks using your face as
the passcode you know 12 years ago no
one really talked about sustainability
you couldn&#39;t be a social media manager
there was no such thing as a drone pilot
and you couldn&#39;t be a driverless car
engineer because no one had invented
driverless cars yet okay the point is 12
years ago perhaps we didn&#39;t see these
jobs coming a YouTube is only just about
12 years old and who would have thought
then that young people would be making
for the enormous in comes just from
videoing themselves in their bedrooms
talking to camera it&#39;s a remarkable
thing and the thing is we&#39;ve got to be
preparing them for a future where these
jobs that I&#39;m talking about might be
redundant
and that future is unknown now there are
some people and they may well be people
in this room that think we&#39;re on the
cusp of a singularity which basically
means there&#39;s not going to be a lot of
jobs for people because the very bots
are going to do them all I just not sure
that our young people are going to
accept that future you know I think
that&#39;s the necessarily a future that
they&#39;re going to want and I think our
responsibility is to provide them with a
toolkit that at least allows them to ask
ask that question you know we need to
show them that they can start making
decisions about their future now and
that there&#39;s a path that they can choose
that might be different to the ones that
we&#39;re talking about at the moment how
can we do that
well we can show them how to take the
facts that they know and smash those
together with creativity and we can tell
them that those individual subjects they
learn in 35 40 minutes Lots can be mixed
up and blurred so that you can&#39;t tell
the difference between English and
science and maths and friends yeah and
we can take the technology that they use
everyday outside of school and we can
bring that into school and repurpose
re-educate them about what that&#39;s for
because if technology&#39;s going to be a
big part of their future and let&#39;s face
it looks like it is then we have a duty
I think to make sure they know what it
can do and more possibilities that it
offers are because if we teach them
about what is possible then they can
start to challenge that and reach for
the as yet impossible and we keep on
innovating so my own school we have
given every every people an iPad and
we&#39;ve done that for a whole range of
different reasons not one of those
reasons was to improve exam results you
know and I get visits from schools all
around the world they kind of sit in my
office and we talk about technology and
eventually I noted them on to actually
talk about education and I always try
and ask them why it is they want to
bring technology into their school and
it&#39;s amazing the variety of answers that
you get to that question most in a
roundabout sort of way understand that
technology in a school can be
a great tool for advancing learning some
people really don&#39;t know they just kind
of feel like they should because that&#39;s
the way things are going
some people come in because they&#39;ve got
they wanted to be a unique selling point
that another school can&#39;t offer and some
people really do think that&#39;s going to
be a kind of magic bullet and the truth
is you know technology doesn&#39;t change
anything on its own it doesn&#39;t make a
poor teacher a good teacher doesn&#39;t make
an unmotivated people are motivated
people it only works when it&#39;s part of a
bigger picture a bigger picture of
innovation and engagement so we&#39;ve got
iPads in the classroom and what that
means is our students can do things that
those of us sitting in this room could
only have dreamt about when we were at
school impossible things and now
possible in the classroom but also they
can do things the way that we do things
in the world of work
because how often in the world of work
do you get asked to sit in a room in
silence without no access to the digital
world so that you can write down
everything that you know about
photosynthesis well the final act of a
salary you know in the real world get us
to presents you&#39;re asked to research
you&#39;re asked to create you know and at
the tip of your fingers is that digital
world with all sorts of inspiration
available to you and we have an a GCSE
Italian class and they&#39;ve been really
helped along their journey over the last
two years because they conference called
a school in Italy and that means that
fifteen or sixteen year old boys and
girls in England are speaking learning a
language from fifteen or sixteen year
old boys and girls in Italy and it
probably comes as no surprise that they
take that quite seriously because it&#39;s
one thing for your teacher to point at
you and say any talk for 30 seconds
about what your favorite food is in
Italian it&#39;s another thing entirely when
that question or something similar comes
from somebody your own age you know that
interaction really matters and on the
matter of interruptions the other thing
that we&#39;ve had to do is is renegotiate
what technology is for and that&#39;s been a
conversation with student
some with parents so if any of you&#39;ve
got a teenager I&#39;m sure you&#39;re very
familiar with their face but in
particular you&#39;re probably quite
familiar with their face as lit from
underneath with a sort of stark blue a
white light usually seen in the middle
of the night when you thought they&#39;ve
been asleep for two hours and you hear a
strange beeping noise that alerts you to
some strange activity in their room so
it&#39;s no it&#39;s no great secret that you
know young people like technology and in
particular social media you know I guess
social media is kind of like what rock
and roll was to kids in the 50s no it&#39;s
this sort of secret language that adults
aren&#39;t supposed to fully understand and
so what we&#39;ve had to do is is sort of
show you them this technology from a
different perspective yeah so what we&#39;ve
done is we&#39;ve shown them that that that
phone or that tablet or that laptop can
be a tool for creating content not just
passively receiving cat videos it can be
a tool for problem solving rather than
escapism and it can be at all most
importantly for learning you know and
can be a tool for learning rather than
just entertainment and we&#39;ve taken our
parents on that journey as well and so
every year we invite them in for an
evening and we give them an iPad and we
sit them down in our hall and we teach
them a lesson not in a sinister way but
we sit down and they sort of do an
English lesson or a maths lesson and
they use the technology in exactly the
way our children do and they walk out of
our school feeling inspired and a bit
jealous of all the cool things that
their children can do but they really
understand what it is we&#39;re trying to
achieve with technology so over the
summer I launched a coding competition
which I cleverly called Summer of Code
the premise affair is really simple as
an optional activity and the children
had to go away and create a game or an
app and the only guidance I gave them
was a theme which was the planet Earth
and there was a deadline and there was a
promise of a prize for the top three
entries that was it and I think I think
I need to tell you is that entries that
came back with just amazing
the headmaster and I got to sit in his
office playing games and we will try and
get high schools not die power up level
up all that sort of things you expect
from a really good game and it sort of
struck me we didn&#39;t really teach them
how to do that but more strikingly we
didn&#39;t teach them to do the thing that
they did next
I found that two out of the three top
three entries had already monetized
their game one was listed on Kickstarter
net rate he&#39;d raised a goodly sum and
the other was already on the App Store
along with about a dozen our other apps
he&#39;d already had already created making
money through advertising
I was just astonishing that that&#39;s a
self-taught innovation was amazing so
there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that the
Summer of Code was a success but I
didn&#39;t feel like it was quite finished I
thought there was more we could do so
we&#39;ve now got a grief of students
building that right now building a
classic six-foot arcade machine and that
machine is going to play the games of
those those winning entries and the
machines got a coin slots and it&#39;s going
to stand somewhere in school and it&#39;s
going to raise money for charity kids
going to play games it&#39;s going to raise
money for charity and that&#39;s amazing and
and for me that project has been the
embodiment of innovation really it&#39;s
brought together a really diverse group
of people you know different ages
different genders different skills we&#39;ve
got coders doing the interface we&#39;ve got
people doing technical drawings
musicians writing a school all sorts of
different things going on and we&#39;ve also
got wannabe economist tracking every
single penny that we spend at the end of
it once we built it they&#39;re going to
tell me whether or not there&#39;s a viable
business at the end of it and if there
is then even more people get to be
involved with marketing and business
planning and web design for me that that
is innovation you know some of these are
skills that we have taught them and some
of them are skills that they&#39;ve taught
themselves I&#39;ll be the first to admit I
do not know how to build an arcade
machine
I know Dickens
I couldn&#39;t code as complex again as they
have coded but it turns out I don&#39;t need
to what I needed to do was show them how
to take the facts that they knew and
apply them in a creative way I needed to
get them to collaborate in a space where
they felt free to challenge themselves
and make mistakes and just get on with
them that&#39;s how the innovation happened
and so innovation in education is a
really essential thing the the the the
world that they become adults in is not
our world yeah and we have a
responsibility to try and help them
navigate that path but we also have a
responsibility I think to make sure that
they see what education could and should
be there should be something
collaborative it should be something
creative it should be something that
celebrates the blending of facts and
skills and it should feel relevant to
them at all times and it should also
allow them to engage with technology in
a meaningful way so in other words one
Elon Musk is great but we need more
people with big ideas and the
wherewithal to see them through so that
the future is not written by an elite
group of visionaries but by everyone
[Applause]
