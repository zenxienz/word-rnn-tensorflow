have you ever felt compelled to lay your
soul bear to tell complete strangers
things about yourself
the conjure up immense feelings of shame
I&#39;m guessing most of you it&#39;s nor and
why would you right how about when it
got to the point in your life but those
feelings of shame give you no peace they
paralyze you they affect your every
thought they keep you away from your
dreams your aspirations your friends
your family and yourself
there is no acceptance of who you are or
who you want to become what do you do
then and how do you free yourself from
that I recently came to ask myself a
different question a question that
rocked me to my core and a walk a part
of me that I&#39;ve long forgotten what if I
showed up in life as who I truly am
despite those fears of shame let me
begin with this picture-perfect life
that I&#39;d created for myself I&#39;m married
to an amazing man have two beautiful
children a successful career our own
home great friends of everything I need
a life right up my feet but instead of
feeling a sense of accomplishment I&#39;m
left feeling empty and alone inside I
would look in the mirror not recognize a
person looking back at me and tell
myself how I didn&#39;t deserve this
beautiful life of mine you see we all
have this voice this feeling inside of
us that guides us that tells us when
we&#39;re on the right path and when we&#39;re
not four years had become an expert at
numbing that voice it started with an
occasional drink that
turned into a bottle or two or three
anything to keep that voice a mute
alcohol for me was my way of numbing
those feelings that all was not well
despite these poor choices I was me I
never once thought that what I was doing
was anything other than normal behavior
after all we all like a drink every now
and again right for me it wasn&#39;t just a
drink every now and again it was a same
old story I would wake up in the morning
feeling ashamed and angry there is once
again hangover I spend my days trying to
hold myself together hoping nobody would
recognize my disheveled self all the
time I would tell myself tonight is a
night nor more drinking only to find

myself with a wine glass in hand by 5:00
p.m. and so the cycle continued then one
morning I found myself saw hangover that
I was vomiting into a plastic bag
sitting in my car at my children&#39;s kindy
having reached a new low I started to
ask myself some hard questions what was
really going on here I started to think
about the number of times I would wake
in the men head pounding feeling sick to
my stomach thinking how am I gonna get
out of bed let alone get myself to work
why was i choosing to drink well
I later learned that it was because I
was hiding a huge part of myself from
the world all because of a fear of
judgment from others but
had the story even come from one memory
stuck out the most when I was fifteen my
best friend came out as being gay living
in a small town in Wales being gay at
that time wasn&#39;t exactly the thing that
you did
which meant I spent most of my days to
fend in his right to be who he was one
day a parent turned to me and said all
birds of a feather flock together it was
just a sentence but it was delivered
with such disgust and disdain that a
wave of shame
came over me the feeling that taste
stuck a story was formed owning who you
are
equals judgment and judgment equals
shame just be Noble and that&#39;s what I
did from that day on for 17 years of my
life I lived a life that I thought was
normal so they would never have to feel
that way again
three years ago the power of those words
began to fade as at the age of 32 I
finally discovered and accepted that I
am gay I now know that I&#39;m living a lie
that I&#39;m unhappy and that I can&#39;t go on
like this
I know what needs to be done but it is
so scary that I&#39;m right back to being a
15 year old again I can taste the shame
and I could feel the judgment already
but I stop and I ask myself what lesson
am i teaching my children if I can&#39;t
show up in life as who I meant to be I
can and I will no longer be ashamed of
Who I am
as I leave my marriage I break up a
beautiful family and I hurt those
closest to me it took me a long time to
forgive myself for the hurt that I&#39;d
caused for what I couldn&#39;t ignore was
after accepting my sexuality I was
finally comfortable in my own skin I
made myself a promise there couldn&#39;t be
any more numbing alcohol had already
robbed me of enough I started to finally
be bold make my own decisions and
embrace me I quit my six-figure salary
for the unknown picked up exciting new
projects and pursued new relationships I
was winning I had reached my destination
screw you shame
there was no destination my reality was
that alcohol had become more than just
something I once used to numb those
feelings that all was not well as it was
now fully ingrained in my life even at
this point alcohol still had ahold of me
it was my greatest source of shame and
was about to become my biggest challenge
yet I started to think about the
possibility that I was addicted to
alcohol but those people were weak
weren&#39;t they they&#39;d lost everything
because of alcohol I had my life sorted
right great new job new home happy kids
I was finally living a life that I
wanted not who I thought was acceptable
to others but the pure thought of life
without alcohol terrified me I couldn&#39;t
even father met and so it took a string
of drunken incidents
small injuries and new lows for me to
come to the realization that if I didn&#39;t
wake up boom and deal with this then I
was just existing in life and I had not
come this far to just exist in life as
soon as I started to accept that I was
addicted to alcohol a shift happened
inside of me I felt stronger I felt that
I could rewrite this story I&#39;ve swapped
hangovers for climbing mountains and far
healthier emotionally and physically I&#39;m
a better role model for my children and
I have boundless energy to take on new
adventures I&#39;m finally embracing all of
me the good the bad and the somewhat
ugly now I can look in the mirror and I
like what I see what I did discover when
I started to share my story with others
and share the things that once brought
me a great deal of shame and kept me
down and back in life but instead of a
judgement that I&#39;d come to expect I in
fact received love and support
conversation after conversation I
discovered that more and more of us are
living a life that&#39;s not true to
ourselves and are using something to
help numb that to make it okay I was and
I&#39;m still not alone now what do I have
to share from this journey of mine so
far firstly listen to that voice or that
feeling don&#39;t ignore it for as long as I
did sometimes might be hard but it&#39;s
even harder to live a life of pretense
believe me I know
be kind to yourself accept that you&#39;re
human you make mistakes and that it&#39;s ok
get support that was by far the hardest
the most challenging thing that I had to
do was to reach out to those around me
and openly ask for that support but I
know that wouldn&#39;t be where I am today
as far along in this journey if it
wasn&#39;t for the support of those people
and that&#39;s something I&#39;m truly grateful
for and lastly surround yourself with
the people that get and see your future
self because they&#39;ll keep you honest
along the way so on why did I feel
compelled to lay my soul bare to a room
full of complete strangers well it was
with the hope that through sharing my
story it would inspire change in others
the for those of you who are here today
who maybe aren&#39;t living a life that&#39;s
true to you whatever that might be that
you can see your way forward as for me
what&#39;s next in my journey well I guess
only time will tell
