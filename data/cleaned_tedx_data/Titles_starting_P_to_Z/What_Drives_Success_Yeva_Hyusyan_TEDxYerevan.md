so what is success why some of us don&#39;t
achieve more and others achieve less how
one defines more and less
what are those drivers the inner
motivation to do or not to do things why
some of us are perfectly happy with
whatever we have and others try for more
and more and more so what is the formula
of success so I googled ok so to be
successful you gotta work hard be
dedicated feel I search some more you
gotta be passionate have that purpose in
life be committed be able to set goals
and then I came across this successful
people are raising from failures some
more celebrities raising from failures
and then I was urged to see the future
so I can be successful so basically to
sum up you gotta be able to see the
future so you have that vision of how to
change the world you have to be
passionate so you can go through all the
struggles and hardships you gotta feel
the more the merrier the harder the
better and probably some other things
but something doesn&#39;t seem right here
something doesn&#39;t click so let&#39;s talk
about seeing the future being that
visionary so you wake up and you clearly
know where you&#39;re going and you just
keep going and moving on and one day you
get there being you&#39;re successful not
true in fact being driven by a single
scenario is the worst thing you can do
in the world of innovation because
innovation is all about finding the
right idea through multiple iterations
tests and trials feedback analysis for
me personally the hard
this thing has always been to come up
with that big story of how we&#39;re
changing the world in our company so we
started with this small app that would
teach you how to code on your mobile
phone and then it grew into a more
interactive environment where you can
actually code on your mobile and also
interact with peers then one step up
today it&#39;s a community of very active
quad learners that in addition to
learning also developed all of their
learning content and tomorrow it might
be something else but the point here is
you never know where you&#39;re headed in
the very beginning and we&#39;ve always
known that we&#39;re aiming for something
really big really global yet defining it
has been a challenge because defining
the end goal takes time the end
definition is built slowly and it&#39;s
built with each accomplishment and the
more you move forward the more puzzle
pieces basically come together okay now
my favorite one so it&#39;s not really by
I&#39;m gonna get to X by doing this but
it&#39;s rather cyclic oh and each of the
loops is self-sufficient in itself it
has pretty much of every life ingredient
in there it has hope support passion
disappointment fear and it&#39;s all about
how much you can and want to handle and
how much and that basically defines how
much you will be able to advance and go
to the next level okay failures be ready
to fail accept failure every person who
is seen great success has been through
great failures well that&#39;s bullshit I
mean in the startup world we promote the
failure culture and there is probably
some rationale behind that because if
more people try probably more are
successful in the end
but as a result we take failure as an
end destination versus just as another
experience in any
because feeler or things are not going
right just as normal as things are going
great experiences or nothing is really
happening experiences or days when
you&#39;re creative or days when you are
procrastinating so basically it&#39;s all
about moving to the next level learning
from the good and the bad and even from
nothing is really happening honestly I
don&#39;t think anyone who was after
something big ever felt that they were
failing or suffering but with all her
des stories Walt Disney was fired due to
lack of creativity Madonna was posing
nude for money prior to becoming famous
Steve Jobs was fired from a company that
he found it honestly I don&#39;t think any
of those people were feeling that they
were suffering I think the reason these
people succeeded was because they
couldn&#39;t stand a chance of failure they
couldn&#39;t tolerate it I came across von
Bock&#39;s
letter generally his letters to his
brother and in particular this one was
when he was isolated in a French
countryside and that was the peak of his
mental illness
mangog the most suffering artists of all
times let&#39;s see what he writes about his
living so basically he says for me
working here or anywhere else it&#39;s not
any different and that&#39;s the only
sentence that he has in the lighter and
then the rest of the letter he goes on
and on about colors about proportions
about his nest next work about the
previous odd four artworks so basically
the only thing he has on his mind is how
to reach the next level of mastery how
to advance how to move forward and then
we probably make the failure stories up
later on because that&#39;s what human we
humans want emotional stories in general
are better hurt suffering and
vulnerability triggers sympathy and if
everyone wants to hear
failure story you probably make one up
and you keep telling it over and over
again and at some point you start
believing in it yourself I was
interviewed a couple of months ago and I
was obviously asked my biggest failure
question and my mind was what what do I
tell him okay probably I gotta tell him
about the fundraising because you&#39;re
supposed to be suffering then right or
maybe I tell him about the feature that
will launch that got this negative user
reviews and and and I&#39;m trying to come
up with something something really fake
well just because he asked and secondly
you got to have a failure story in order
to be successful right so I can go on
and on about stereotypes forever but the
point I&#39;m trying to get it if thinking
big failing being passionate work
hundred hours a week read 300 300 books
a year get trained to be a better leader
or get trained to be a better negotiator
if all these things are not the drivers
of success then what is what makes us
want more what make sure we get there so
it&#39;s basically very simple it&#39;s our
desire to stand out that says the bar
it&#39;s our ego that moves us from one
level to another so basically I mean
it&#39;s me standing out that keeps me going
so the formula to success is pretty
straightforward if you&#39;re lucky enough
and if you&#39;ve worked really hard to
bring your potential in line with your
ego it&#39;s a success story and doesn&#39;t
have matter how big or small your
success loop is you feel successful you
feel accomplished yet if the two are not
in balance we get a disaster we get a
social disaster when one&#39;s ego is
greater than their potential and we all
know those people among our friends and
colleagues that whine and complain
and blame everyone and everything for
not being success successful and then
the third scenario is not any better
either because we also have those people
among the friends and colleagues that we
all think have a potential to achieve
more but for some reason their ego fails
to push them up and these are the people
who always think they&#39;re not good enough
for whatever they have so basically
instead of focusing on stereotypes which
are destructive and disturbing maybe we
should focus more on bringing the to
imbalance and finding our own unique
balancing point because achieving
balance is much harder when you feel bad
about not having that great idea of
changing the world rather than setting
up smaller goals and implementing those
and moving forward achieving balance is
harder when instead of finding your feet
in life you are focused on how unhappy
you are in your current state achieving
balance is much harder when you take
failure as an end destination rather
than failure is just another part of the
process in anything you do
so basically stereotypes they don&#39;t let
you be successful I mean they distract
you from finding your own balance and
they produce errors and the errors do
not let you optimize your own unique
software so find your good ego be in
balance be successful thank you
