imagine we have two groups of
high-school students right existing in
the same school
one group is commonly thought of as
popular and cool and everybody knows
them everybody likes them
I mean seriously though you know the
group and so these students are all that
and some meaning they their clique is
believed to be everything and they tend
to be generally favored by everyone in
that environment and so I mean you can
see it right and there is this informal
understanding within the school&#39;s
culture of who they are and so these
students present themselves as empowered
bold and confident often holding down
lead positions because they are almost
guaranteed to run and win school offices
and so maybe their clique is known by
the style or way they dress whatever
they wear or do for that matter is seen
as the best or perhaps isn&#39;t the way
that they talk dropping little nuggets
here or there no biggie really but that
keeps the others reminded of who they
are after all these are the cool kids
now just think about this other group
yes the kids who have been under dand
who are often viewed as the exact
opposite of the cool group and not
because they chose to be but because
that&#39;s how they have been labeled groups
and all together thought to be and by
who well let&#39;s think about this because
distinctions have to be made right after
all the stellar reputation of the cool
kids depends on it and so the unpopular
ones or the others don&#39;t just wake up
one day and say
oh my gosh I would absolutely love to be
the weird one today the one that knows I
will be so funded on and embarrassed
should I ever find myself in there
meaning the cool kids in their huddle of
friends no that&#39;s totally not how that
works and so it is being the decidedly
cool kids that define the others and so
then keep them in sync with how the
others are often thought about or
treated at the same high school there&#39;s
really not a lot to say about them other
than I don&#39;t know they&#39;re just different
and for whatever reason they just don&#39;t
seem to fit in and so generally they
receive very little attention unless
negative and instead they are just kind
of tolerated put up with or clearly
understood as who not to be if you want
to be accepted and as long as they stay
out of the way or flow of the cool kids
then usually everything&#39;s peachy and so
like I often say to my college students
who many of which are not long out of
high school themselves now that you have
this picture and this kind of
interaction as a point of reference
let&#39;s think about this critically
because this high school is just like
our society our cities our nation our
globe even and all social structures and
institutions that fall between them
where there is a historically clear way
of communicating and understanding who&#39;s
who
meaning which group is in which group is
out or perhaps which bunch is normal and
which folks are not and so it is under
this same group arrangement along with
verbal and nonverbal exchanges that
marginalized populations come to be on
third or experience what can be referred
to as microaggressions or micro
aggressive behaviors where many
marginalized persons risk being exposed
and reminded of being a
find to the other group and therefore
left feeling vulnerable uncomfortable
and altogether uneasy as if the last or
least desired kid picked to beyond the
team translation any place any time any
given situation at a bus stop a museum
or perhaps while out shopping even that
marginalized populations come to be
publicly humiliated or identified as the
other there were presumption with
statements and questions like wow your
English is pretty good so where are you
from which is often cold for some how
you don&#39;t look American to me and as a
sidebar critically thinking what does
that mean no really what does looking
American mean in any case the assumption
is things that they are not and really
whether they are or not can we
understand how they were just other dinh
the huddle kind of pointed out as I
don&#39;t know maybe appearing an ordinary
perhaps or how about asking someone so
what are you exactly as if the answer is
a prerequisite for interacting with them
all the while taking assessment of their
eyes or perhaps their skin complexion
because see once again there is this
seemingly unwavering need to assign
people to categories or just maybe
exposure or other income through
statements that somehow suggests you as
being special like your the different
one
okay and so let&#39;s go with that different
how exactly like what does that mean
right sounds just like what happens with
the cool kids
versus the other students at the high
school in any case these are
microaggressions what I like to think of
as seemingly what
intended statements and questions and
behaviors really that are insulting and
condescending with very racialized
coding attached to them and so in
essence when I speak of microaggressions
I am speaking of a concept coined by
professor emeritus of psychiatry and
education at Harvard University dr.
Chester peers that refers to what I will
describe as below radar behaviors that
whether intended or not act as dog
whistles for racism and zenit phobic
exchanges and so while in this talk I am
speaking to racial and ethnic
interactions likewise you should know
that microaggressions can also be
applicable experienced and understood
with other group dynamics regarding
gender sexual orientation religion and
so forth that&#39;s it
let me reiterate a few things one
microaggressions can be subtle and more
often did not occur with seemingly well
intended folks to facial expressions and
body language can be equally telling and
impactful and so it is important to know
that the Huff&#39;s and puffs rolling a by
shifting bodies eerily gawking at
someone or refusing to make eye contact
altogether and instead the whole talking
past you thing as if everyone else in
the room or discussion matters and you
do not especially when racial matters
are brought up then sending byes that
suggest get it arrest enough already
why do we have to keep talking about
this I have a black friend
all the while annoyingly and perhaps
even unintentionally communicating
arrogance privilege or a lack of
consideration for context how all of
this interaction might be landing see
people of color simply do not get race
briefs there are no timeouts scheduled
intermissions or a cushiony
Fenian moments for experiencing
discrimination if anything there are
only instances of psychological redress
where many marginalized persons feel
culturally compelled or cornered really
to not address to not even address these
issues as they occur for fear of being
further stigmatized and identified as
rebel rousers combative radical militant
and other very racialized or perhaps we
can just say micro aggressive labels
that negatively impact the true and
possible cultural and racial education
to transformation process which is the
reason for this very top we persons of
color simply can&#39;t press pause on the
social construction of race and its
social implications as attached to our
black and brown onus and so the thought
or idea of colorblindness or a
colorblind society is a myth and
unknowingly in and of itself is a
microaggression so sure it&#39;s a catchy
suggestion sounds good sounds pretty
unifying on the surface which is all we
want what we all should want we should
want unity but let&#39;s be honest does seem
that now make me appear clearer am I now
translucent can you suddenly not see me
fat shame my honey brown caramel
complexion as I speak or better yet
let&#39;s think of it this way if you had to
describe me to someone what all would
you say and in what order
and if by chance you did not mention
race would it then be gender it&#39;s just
another category for judging based on
historic and compromising distinctions
and so by virtue a social construction
and stratification ignoring race and
this notion of colorblindness is simply
not possible because whether admitted or
not people have been socialized or
taught directly and indirectly
identify group and define all people
based on superficial characteristics and
so it becomes incumbent upon all of us
to study these matters to study and more
importantly to keep culturally diverse
and truly progressive people in both our
professional and personal circles why
because our culture keeps reverting and
diverting folks to only focus on the
most obvious aspects of discrimination
like burning crosses spray-painting hey
graffiti on property using the n-word or
other similar highly publicized
historical actions that we&#39;ve all come
to know so well and so as a result
people are then left comfortably
unknowledgeable
unaware and unable to recognize or even
gauge what is appropriate or
inappropriate sensitive or insensitive
beyond those things when interacting
with marginalized populations which in
many respects is translation for this is
being unimportant and you not having to
even be aware of it and so then this is
how people who believe themselves to
have the best of intentions come to be
surprisingly labeled as racist then feel
hurt confused even and ultimately find
themselves as unpopular and
uncomfortable or at risk of being
distanced or picked last in their own
huddle and so instead of only knowing to
disavow the displaying swastikas hanging
nooses and other obvious actions
likewise the mission and sense of
urgency has to be the same and staying
clear of microaggressions those subtle
of the rain&#39; behaviors comments like
your kind and people like you or maybe
actions such as complimenting someone on
their hairstyle which is great instead
of asking a series of intrusive
questions about it and presumptuously
trying to touch it to feel don&#39;t do that
to feel the texture of it or maybe we
should not talk that act of if we are
deeply connected with the
hispanic and latino community because we
love tacos and fajitas or just maybe we
should not assume that all persons of
Asian descent are rich and work in
Silicon Valley or reference them even as
model minorities which is actually a
backhanded insult I could go on and on
as this is an invaluable opportunity to
learn and grow if you are receptive
after all my mission has simply been to
call attention to more subtleties and
nuances of everyday seemingly normalized
discriminative behaviors with the hope
of divulging information that might
advance us intellectually and
humanitarian Lee which intrinsically
means entering into embracing and
sharing in this space of enlightenment
and altruism where personal and cultural
transparency and conviction becomes
forever unavoidable where historically
induced social awareness remains
fundamental followed by an unequivocal
acknowledgment of power privilege or
really this very real global
consequential theme better known as
dominant entitlement perhaps ownership
even the idea of becoming ever so
cognizant a worn social location and
what that location means and makes
possible or not for those whose everyday
existence is fashioned by discrimination
and then if I could be so blessed
assuming that after having arrived in
some measure to an increased knowledge
of systemic arrangements and culpability
I thank you for being receptive and
embracing all that&#39;s possible through
social transformation which means like
our theme rise right and so for rising
to the occasion in this treasured moment
of time critically thinking and
rethinking the status quo all the while
aiming to rise through what is often
characterized as unreasonable and
Cerie dialogue and yet still pushing
with the hope of rising because yes we
keep addressing racism sexism racism
classism homophobia racism again
religious intolerance and on and on and
on yes the unavoidable place where some
have and may steal voice discontentment
through denial
perhaps out loud or even inside as if
neither are discernible and they are
because remember those two are
microaggressions which is exactly the
point of all of this because see no
matter the wording or volume of the
sentiments we rise through our ability
to identify uncover disavow and disallow
those feelings those attitudes wherever
and however they exist that under our
right and ability to share in
unimaginable equitable and harmonious
spaces so I challenge you dear friends
to challenge you
meaning yourself and your neighbors to
to rise as interconnected interdependent
members of our wonderful global
community and to do so while continuing
to learn process and ultimately digest
the socialization and comfortability of
micro aggressions thank you
you
