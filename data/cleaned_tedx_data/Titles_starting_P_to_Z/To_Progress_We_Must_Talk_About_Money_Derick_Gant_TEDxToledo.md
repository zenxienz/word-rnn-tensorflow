it&#39;s Saturday morning and the Gantt man
has made a declaration we are going to
host our first manly man male-bonding
breakfast now if you don&#39;t know anything
about men we think better with food so
we picked a great restaurant so we&#39;re at
a restaurant and we&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s
time for us to conquer some of our
problems of the world and in doing that
we decided that we needed to get going
so we&#39;re a breakfast and just like every
other man you&#39;re like what do we do we
you know you really need a woman to help
you get started so we do what we men do
best small talk we talked about sports
like why did my dad like the Cleveland
Browns I mean nobody likes the Cleveland
Browns we talked about politics we
talked about religion we all go to the
same church and finally we get to the
point to where we actually cross about
what&#39;s going on in modern world we were
going through a major real estate bubble
and the market had blown up and I was
with my family so I felt really
comfortable comfortable with them saying
you know I feel like I&#39;m real estate
poor and we bought this big house and
the deal was was that years before I had
purchased the most amazing house five
acres of land five bedrooms six and a
half baths all on the most amazing lake
that you could ever want to see so my
dad pipe something he says dude you&#39;re
the financial guru of the family I
thought you had all this under control
now as you know us men we&#39;re not big
talkers so I had never asked my dad for
advice and he had never offered advice
to be totally honest with you my mother
gave us the sex talk
true so he pipes up and he begins to say
and mention everything that anyone would
want to know err consider before you
make a major purchase like that so I
immediately you know as a as a
professional I&#39;m thinking and I&#39;m like
well you know my friends haven&#39;t been
real good to me
ego Prai silence I said I need a new set
of friends so I began to think about
this and I said I need to be more open I
need to ask more questions I need to be
more vulnerable so with that I said you
know I have to begin to figure out how
to do this and it wasn&#39;t easy it wasn&#39;t
easy it wasn&#39;t it was so difficult that
I&#39;m gonna ask you to help me figure out
so you could figure out what it felt
like for me to be vulnerable so what I
want you to do I want you to drop your
inhibitions I know you&#39;ve had a lot of
serious talks drop your inhibitions take
a deep breath and I simply want you to
turn to your neighbor and ask your
neighbor how much money
exactly now listen your discomfort comes
from the fact that talking about money
is the single largest taboo that we&#39;ve
left we talk about everything nowadays
if you don&#39;t know it asking someone how
much money they make is a major nono we
don&#39;t do it personally we don&#39;t do what
at work you know I dated someone I still
don&#39;t know how much money she makes all
right so you just don&#39;t do it so in the
process of well what happens if I do
well check out my man here his name is
Greg guy Greg worked for Twitter for two
days before a three year old old
Facebook post resurfaced where he had
ridicule some homeless people in San
Francisco now if you didn&#39;t hear what I
said he worked there two days because
the taboo of criticizing the homeless
got him fired we talked about everything
we talked about politics
how many of you have lost friends lately
talking about politics
I mean seriously right we talked about
religion we talked about sex
remember when you thought Fifty Shades
of Grey was just the color palette now
everybody knows what the Red Room is so
if you notice we have talked about
everything and we feel comfortable
talking about everything except for the
one thing that divides us the most money
it is not uncommon for us to see wealthy
people look at poor and poor people look
and act rich I mean it is the
straightest thing in the universe I
regularly have clients that come see me
and they&#39;re they&#39;re pretty much a
wealthy clients and they show up in
khakis Levi&#39;s some some work shoes they
get out of a pickup truck
and they come in and you would never
know they had a dime and I have other
clients that are less substantial and
they show up in an outfit with designer
outfit from Tom Ford and I automobiles
is worth half the price of their home
and the question we begin to ask
ourselves is how can this be why do we
do it and what we have to come
understand is that the taboo of
discussing money makes us embarrassed
it makes us fearful so we take a look
and we take a step back and we say well
why should I care you should care
because we live in the most abundant
society in the world at the best time
ever and people are silently suffering
in financial desperation now wealthy
people will go out and they&#39;ll say hey I
need to hire somebody and we saw this in
the last election they&#39;ll hire somebody
to make them save more money on taxes
and things while the rest of us we&#39;re in
the library or the bookstore looking for
it look call investments for dummies all
right so we have to be careful to
understand that it is a stigma and a
taboo so I was looking at some
statistics you are not going to believe
this seventy five percent of working
American families are living check to
check that means they have less than
$400 anywhere I mean think about this
they are one emergency away from a
market from a personal crisis just one
emergency last week this is not a lie
last week I got a flat tire that cost me
four hundred fifty dollars and this then
the stim on a different tire broke and
that cost me $400 just one emergency
away from not being able to drive to get
to work
for most of our American families and
you might say well thank God dudes not
talking to me I got 400 bucks right but
the reality is is that this affects all
of us so I&#39;ll tell you on a whim they
might in my little traffic pattern one
of my buddies has a small business and
it&#39;s not really small I call it small so
I stopped by and I get past the
gatekeeper and this dude&#39;s got the best
policy ever he always allows anyone
that&#39;s a family or friend that they stop
or call him he will stop what he&#39;s doing
he&#39;ll
tame them or communicate with them so I
get by the gatekeeper and I get into his
office and I see dude it&#39;s like he&#39;s
like staring at his computer and he&#39;s
really kind of upset and I had never
seen his dude upset over the last five
six years so I looked at him he weighs
me in and I said hey you look a little
intense should I come back he said no no
no maybe you can help me with something
I said okay well what can I help you
with he said I&#39;m looking at my son&#39;s
bank statement and his accounts
overdrawn and I said well why are you
looking at your son&#39;s bank statement he
said you know my son say no more
so he&#39;s looking in this son&#39;s bank
statement and it counts negative and I
said well why are you so there&#39;s
negative
he said I&#39;m upset because I just paid
dude two days ago and I was like okay I
said I pretty much can tell you what
happened he says how can you tell what
happened him looking at the computer I
said let me tell you what happened
so young will was doing what what 22
year olds do he overspent you know it&#39;s
easy to do when you just swipe the card
cuz there&#39;s no checking balance marks I
said you overspent and he was too
embarrassed or scared to go to his rich
dad and say dad I&#39;m broke I overspent I
need some money so what he did was he
went to the bank and he got an early
access loan and then he said whoa whoa
whoa and then nothing
what&#39;s an early access well I said you
don&#39;t know what the payday loan is he&#39;s
like no I said you don&#39;t know what a pay
cheque advances he said do what is it I
said okay here we go
a payday loan is when you go to your
bank and in this case you don&#39;t have to
leave your phone or your computer and
you click a button that says hey if I
make $1,000 I want you to advance me
seven hundred bucks right and then on
the next payday
as soon as I get my check the loan shark
I&#39;m sorry the bank
once their money back so they get their
money back plus they charge you a fee
10% 15% 20% 29% let&#39;s just say it&#39;s 10%
that leaves young will two hundred and
thirty dollars now he goes but his
accounts negative I said I&#39;m not done
I&#39;m gonna tell you what he did so what
he did was he went out and he
automatically had some of his bills paid
maybe yet his car automatically paid
maybe his rents automatically paid or
his car insurance so he did that they
bounced one of them clear and his
accounts negative and he said that&#39;s
highway robbery I see you sit on the
bank board he&#39;s is that he was livid now
the question becomes are you ready to go
to payday loan I hope not because
there&#39;s nothing but sharks out there so
he says what can we do about this
I said well obviously you need to talk
to young will I said better yet you
should probably let me talk to young
will and help him understand how not to
get out of this because if you notice if
he only had 230 dollars left guess what
he has to pay out of that check that he
was supposed to have money for and he
doesn&#39;t have it so the cycle starts
again so he is wild so the question
becomes what if all of us could to
openly talk about our money situation I
challenge you to believe that over a
million people millions and millions of
people would feel comfortable going out
just just asking for financial help they
wouldn&#39;t feel the guilt the shame the
embarrassment of talking about their
money situation because we all know
we&#39;re supposed to be able to handle our
money all right
money would no longer be the number one
cost for a divorce meaning that we would
have more solid families which means
we&#39;d have a better society men and women
with equal skill sets would get what
equal pay you said a woman said that you
know right we get equal pay and all of
our stress levels would drop I think
there&#39;s just no question so I&#39;ve known
this forever
so of course I knew I was doing this
talk so I have to go out and do some
research and again when you get ready to
start doing some research and you start
asking people questions you know we men
we do it better with food so I&#39;m not a
bunch of my buddies for lunch now we&#39;re
doing what we do now the only difference
between this meeting and the meeting
with my dad and my brother is that we
talk about sex all right so I&#39;ll meet
with my buddies and halfway through
lunch I say to them guys let me ask you
a question all of you are successful I
mean they all do really well which one
of you learned finance from your mom or
dad or from school silence one guy says
well my dad I did my dad made me had a
paper route and he made me save every
dime that I made it the paper route and
I said okay cool go I said so you&#39;re
telling me that you learned all about
charge cards budgeting wants versus
needs from your dad&#39;s paper out story
he&#39;s like no so none of you learn
anything about personal money management
from home or school now okay and they
always get ready to get back to the
normal targets lately lately here&#39;s a
better question knowing how hard life is
and how long you had to struggle because
all those guys are self-made how many of
you taught your kids personal money
management and all over his truck not
one not one so the question becomes why
is it because we&#39;re all just hiding or
we just don&#39;t know any better I mean it
really is an interesting thought so when
you begin to look at it and I asked you
a really serious question earlier right
ask your neighbor how much money do you
make
going home I&#39;m gonna give you a secret
going home and saying I liked his talk
I&#39;m gonna start talking about money in
society going home and asking your
neighbor yell bro I laid down 150 last
year what you bring home it ain&#39;t gonna
work
you&#39;re gonna lose you&#39;re not gonna get
you get uninvited from the Christmas
party okay but what if we broke the ice
in our social media what if we all said
you know I&#39;m gonna take my triumphs and
I&#39;m going to share I&#39;m not ask you to
share your failures I&#39;m not gonna share
my and I&#39;m not gonna ask you to anything
I&#39;m not gonna do but what about your
triumphs you ever seen that person that
holds up the pair pants you know and
it&#39;s bigger than they are and they go
this used to be me and I lost 80 pounds
what happens in the comments all
congratulations that was awesome
incredible how did you do it how long
did it take was it hard did you gain the
weight back and that person answers
those questions either publicly or
privately but what if we could do the
same thing with our money I paid my
house off how did you do it that&#39;s
amazing how long did it take 30 years
okay what you paid your car off you paid
your charge card off if you hit a
savings goal hey I hit my savings goal
by August and I did the whole year I&#39;m
gonna blow it out of the water people
will begin to feel more comfortable
asking those questions so I will tell
you this you can&#39;t go ask your neighbors
how much money they make you can&#39;t share
it on social media but you can also have
the money talk right after you have the
sex talk right so you set your kid down
you say yeah don&#39;t touch her and then
you say because she&#39;s gonna cost you
this much money
all right so so you have to think about
having that talk think about encouraging
the school systems to make it mandatory
to teach personal money management in
high school I called the local area and
said hey do you guys have this course do
you have anything close to this course I
emailed my email my email and I got no
response and you know what this was
funny thing was is that my brother works
for the school system I still got no
response they we don&#39;t teach it so I
told you that the number one cause for
divorce was money and it&#39;s not true
the number one cause for divorce is lack
of communication but I&#39;m always right so
what&#39;s the number one conversation and
the communication money exactly so what
happens if we told every person looking
to go get a marriage certificate that
they needed to complete a financial
course call my money my mate can&#39;t get
married unless you pass this course I&#39;m
gonna save more marriages so here&#39;s the
deal I challenge you to begin to talk
about money inside your inner circle
that&#39;s not scary talk about it in your
inner circle and what you&#39;re gonna find
is it&#39;ll spread to your outer circle and
before you know it
barriers will begin to break down fears
will will be diminished societies will
feel more comfortable asking questions
and getting answers that they deserve to
get and it will all be for your
betterment as well as your daughters who
deserve equal pay your future has never
been brighter thank you
[Applause]
you
