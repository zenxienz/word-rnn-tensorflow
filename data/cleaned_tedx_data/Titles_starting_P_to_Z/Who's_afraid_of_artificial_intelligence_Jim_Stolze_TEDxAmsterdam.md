one step beyond
if this redhead talk in the 19th century
then you&#39;d be sitting there all dressed
up just like you are now and you&#39;ve
probably come here by horse-drawn
carriage and then in that 19th century
theater a guy like me will be talking to
you about a new invention a breakthrough
technology it&#39;s like a steam engine on
wheels
a horseless carriage let&#39;s call it Auto
automobile chances are that I would be
booed off stage people would shout their
concerns I mean this side of the room
this worker like what about the jobs
what about all the people who taking
care of our horses what about them and
on this side of the room people would go
like it&#39;s not safe an engine on wheels
it&#39;s out of control this is our
relationship with technology first we
don&#39;t quite understand it and we are
programmed to fear it in fact I don&#39;t
know if you&#39;re aware but around the turn
of the 19th century there was actually a
law in many countries that said that if
a automobile would drive on the public
road at least two mechanics needed to be
in the vehicle and there should be one
person in front carrying a red flag I&#39;m
not kidding as a warning it&#39;s true it
sounds silly don&#39;t you think I mean we
all know how this story played out I
mean we can imagine a world without
curse flash-forward 2017 we&#39;re back in
the theater you&#39;re looking awesome by
the way and a guy like me is here on
stage talking about a breakthrough
technology a new invention
machines that can think for themselves
we should call it artificial artificial
intelligence and again people have
concerns this side of the room what
about the jobs what about all the people
that used to sit behind the computers
what about them and you guys you would
say it&#39;s not safe
machines that make decisions it&#39;s out of
control it&#39;s a black box I&#39;m here to
tell you that in 20 years from now we
won&#39;t be able to imagine a world without
artificial intelligence without AI will
it be easy
no it won&#39;t will we make it work yes we
will
so in my talk I&#39;d like to talk a little
bit about these concerns first I&#39;ll talk
about safety no worries then I&#39;ll talk
about the jobs and I will end with what
I call unexpected consequences the
side-effects that new technology tends
to have so let&#39;s start with safety right
why are we so afraid of artificial
intelligence well I think it&#39;s because
the concept of AI is so hard to grasp
that we tend to base our few on what
we&#39;ve seen in Hollywood movies right and
we all know how these movies go is like
machines are getting smarter and smarter
they&#39;re doing a lot of work for us and
then they&#39;ll make us obsolete then
they&#39;ll become so smart they tell even
become self-aware then the revolt
machines taking over robo clips or as
some worn a AI is humanity&#39;s last
invention
now as tempting as this may sound I have
to say outside of Hollywood not a very
likely scenario I mean just look at the
pace of the technological progress I
mean the whole race between man and
machine had started in the end of the
80s I mean Garry Kasparov playing chess
against a chess come
pewter and losing to deep blue then 20
years later we were able to learn a
computer or a set of algorithms to play
go now I have to say go is infinitely
more complex than chess but hey it&#39;s
still a board game and last year the
Grandmaster from South Korea Alisa dough
was beat by a set of algorithms now to
say that another jump of twenty years
and then automatically out of these very
algorithms some more computing power in
some data automatically some come
something as chemically complex as
self-awareness
that&#39;s not computer science I think
that&#39;s science fiction as my friend the
data scientist said he said you know
what a AI is not magic it&#39;s just math
I&#39;m not saying that these that we
shouldn&#39;t worry about these doomsday
scenarios now I think it&#39;s important to
talk about safe implementation of new
technology so what can we learn from the
automobile industry well of course the
key word then is regulation I mean in in
with the introduction of the automobile
we came up with better traffic laws
people had to get their drivers license
we came up with traffic lights and if
that all would fail would always have
insurance now how about AI and
regulation well I think Europe is
leading the way the new GDP our
legislation the general data protection
regulation is a big step forward these
word of the privacy laws and we thought
that&#39;s gonna be a hassle it&#39;s a blessing
in disguise suddenly big organizations
large institutions are talking about the
ethical implications of automated
decision making about transparency
responsibilities about explain ability
and most importantly the question of
this time how can we hold algorithms
ansible accountable and is there still a
human being in the loop this brings me
to the to the job constraints why are we
so afraid of artificial Italians why do
we think that it&#39;ll eat up our jobs well
I think this underlying assumption is
that technology is good for productivity
but bad for jobs this is called
automation angst or the Luddites fallacy
all across history this theory in the
long term has been proven wrong in fact
the MIT economist David author in his
TED talk last year points out that
across all of history throughout all
these innovations from agricultural
industrial automation IT work has
created work and right now there are
more people than ever active on the job
market despite of all this technological
innovation so why should this time be
different look at the car industry the
people who used to work in the stables
went on to work in the car factories the
automotive industry created millions of
jobs a lot of economic growth and the
people who used to carry the flag or
they became accountants I love
accountants by the way and this brings
me through the third part of my talk the
unexpected consequences because you know
what the biggest problem was that the
automobile solved it was horse manure in
New York City alone there were 100,000
horses back in the day producing 1,200
metric tons of manure on a daily basis
there were not enough people to clean it
up it was literally a shitty situation
the smell was horrific and that all
changed with the introduction of the
automobile another side effect of the
car was that it&#39;s freed us
it&#39;s freed us from geographical
limitations suddenly you didn&#39;t have to
work in the same city or village where
you were born hey I will do the same it
will create new markets it will create
new jobs and it will turn out to be a
solution to a problem we didn&#39;t even
know we had turns out the more we learn
about artificial intelligence the more
we become aware of our inner robot we
don&#39;t have to be scared about external
robots we have to be scared of our inner
robot I mean humanity have we come this
far that however each day is being in a
very awkward position behind a screen
more for more than three or four hours a
day clicking through screens finding
information in one system and then
typing in it into another that&#39;s not a
very human work that&#39;s a robot&#39;s work
just like Microsoft Excel freed us from
doing bookkeeping on paper AI will free
us from excel yes a standing ovation no
no no don&#39;t worry no but it sounds good
doesn&#39;t it yeah I mean humans are best
at being human a ice will do the rest
why because AIS are great at number
crunching hey eyes are great as
predictive modeling AIS will do the
heavy lifting for us so that we become
more human the only ones will be jobless
are the ones who don&#39;t pick up this new
technology that is handed to them I
think the future of AI is bright and it
will affect all of us and we should work
together and trust me we have enough
people who are waving the red flag I&#39;m
calling on you I&#39;m counting on you to
actually sit next to the mechanic and
help him design a better safer car the
future is not written it is shaped by
our decisions and actions today so let&#39;s
work too
get her and use AI for good thank you
very much thank you
