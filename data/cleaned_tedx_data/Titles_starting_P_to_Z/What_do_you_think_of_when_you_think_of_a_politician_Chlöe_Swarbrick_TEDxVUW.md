what do you think of when you think of a
politician just reflect on it most of
the time you&#39;re probably not thinking of
somebody who looks like me you think of
a stereotype basically an older white
dude in a suit there you go there he is
you&#39;ve seen him on the front cover of
newspapers you know on the 6 o&#39;clock
news and scattered around your
neighborhood his face on hoardings and
the lead-up to election time I really
trust him you don&#39;t really know him but
somebody&#39;s got to do the job and the guy
seems like he&#39;s kind of the lesser of
the evils and hick you might even have a
beer with him maybe so statistics New
Zealand data demonstrates that less than
half of us trust government institutions
but what about politicians themselves
well the situation is actually much more
dire so a rather ad-hoc survey the
selection thus general election which
we&#39;ve all just had and hopefully
participation demonstrators that only
one in every 15 user lenders trust
politicians themselves why is that I
mean we voted for them men elected them
didn&#39;t we well I think it&#39;s got a lot to
do with who we think our politicians are
and how we see ourselves not just in
relation to them but in relation to the
rest of society basically it all boils
down to trust and this is what I
scientifically call the gap between
people and politics so that gap is the
reason why I honestly ran for office I
couldn&#39;t see myself my friends my family
my classmates my co-workers in politics
it felt performative not substantive it
felt foreign not representative it kind
of just felt like a maintenance of the
way that things are so how does that
work
right when when we
she licked people well it turns out that
hundreds of thousands of us actually
didn&#39;t turn out and elect our
politicians this general election 20% of
New Zealand&#39;s population decided not to
vote how does that work how are we not
taking to the streets at the moment well
I guess that&#39;s because you know there&#39;s
no other real explanation for it except
that we&#39;re in a bit of a lull for some
reason we don&#39;t expect and cannot
foresee change coming out of an
institution so far removed from our
daily lives so entrenched and
bureaucratic jargon and technocratic
woful especially when our communities
are fragmented at an historic scale so
this is me running for the Auckland
mayoralty last year kind of standing out
like a sore thumb amongst the other more
stereotypical politicians that I alluded
to earlier a lot of people came out of
the woodwork to give me advice when I
first put myself forward for election
many people told me that I should just
be older because that I should wait a
little while you know pick up some of
that magical life experience juju other
people told me that I had to smile more
I was basically being asked to become a
politician to shave off my edges dull
down the idealism and turn back the
desire for change by virtue of my age
and my gender I cannot be the
stereotypical politician but as I&#39;ve
already shown research kind of reflects
that we kind of hate that guy we we
don&#39;t trust them at the very least so
why does change make us so uncomfortable
well I&#39;ve got a theory and it&#39;s that I
think that change might remind us a
little bit too much of ourselves you see
if I can be a politician then your
grandma can be too if I can be a
politician then the local Deary owner
your geography teacher you
bus driver your little sister can be
politicians and they have every right to
be but to accept that is to shatter
assumptions and give up the illusion
that politics is something done to us
outside of us instead of for us or with
us to accept that all of us could be and
perhaps should be politicians is to
accept accountability for the role that
any and all of us can play in society so
a next question is what do you think of
when you think of a citizen probably not
thinking of yourself you may think of
you know a businessman filing as taxes
or a public servant or perhaps an
activist or a protester so why don&#39;t we
think of ourselves because citizenship
is primary and a legal sense but in a
social sense it is if anything a
secondary consideration its subservient
to our individuality it&#39;s unusual for us
to think of ourselves in such a light
but all politicians are citizens first
and all of us are actually born citizens
look around you you can actually look
around you or you can choose not to
that&#39;s fine as told this is supposed to
be interactive I get you all blood
flowing last presentation you know how
does so that&#39;s us all of us are citizens
we&#39;re the people who make up society
with the people from whom politicians
are made in to whom politicians are
supposed to be accountable so that&#39;s the
apparent paradox right we get to choose
our politicians but for some reason we
don&#39;t trust them so surely we would
actually just be choosing the people
from among us who are the most
trustworthy but what is the gauge of
trust
what is it that we are actually trusting
our politicians for well that&#39;s another
point of contention and I&#39;d argue a
symptom of the same issue its 2017 and
we&#39;re kind of used to talking past each
other at this point
we have kind of given up explaining to
each other and we&#39;ve all got the
Internet and that automatically curates
proof that I am right and you are wrong
it&#39;s a problem that&#39;s compounded by the
increasing precariousness of modern life
a home and a job and not things to be
taken for granted
in the modern first world we&#39;ve got the
gig economy and record low rates of home
ownership without the security of rental
of rental protection what that means is
that we are increasingly unlikely to
know our neighbors and our co-workers we
are increasingly unlikely to form
community so this is basically the
problem that we&#39;ve got right after
decades of reform and economic and
social sectors we&#39;ve become increasingly
encouraged to just look after ourselves
the prevailing mantra has become one of
personal responsibility and that&#39;s fine
you know personal responsibility it&#39;s
important but it cannot come at the
expense of political responsibility
personal responsibility cannot solve the
biggest issues of our time those issues
they look like climate change
they look like record rates of wealth
inequality in this country at home they
look like the refugee crisis
they look like wars seemingly raging
eternally overseas these are problems
there as individuals are far too big to
comprehend they&#39;re arguably the very
reason that we formulated civil society
and accepted democracy as a mess
convenient decision-making tool civil
society by the way and just for the
record is defined
a society considered as a community of
citizens linked by common interest and
collective activity unbridled
self-interest is then the antithesis to
civil society time and again research
has shown that when we expect other
people to act in self-interest it gives
us an excuse to do so basically we
behave badly when we think other people
will this kind of feedback loop is
terrible it&#39;s a self-fulfilling prophecy
and are hiding to nowhere so what we
need is a fuse breaker and what I&#39;m
reminded of is George Orwell&#39;s kind of
resounding thought which i think is
particularly important at a time of fake
news and alternative facts in a time of
universal deceit telling the truth
feels like a revolutionary act so where
are we going and how do we get things
back on track well let me tell you I&#39;m a
philosophy nerd for those who may not
know that was something which was
neglected from my biography but I&#39;m a
big fan of this philosopher John Rawls
he had this theory called the veil of
ignorance it&#39;s basically this thought
experiment where you try and design a
society from scratch but the hitch is
that you don&#39;t know who or where you
will be placed in that society the
argument goes that most of us will end
up designing a society with a position
of the person who is in the worst lowest
position they are still living a life
that is not just livable but ultimately
meaningful there is designing a society
from the position of the common good
there is what I would argue as how
politicians should design legislation
for civic society but we have to demand
and expect that they do that we have to
trust them to do it and be mad as hell
if they don&#39;t to the point that
vote them out or stand ourselves we have
to trust other citizens it can no longer
be about you versus me it has got to be
about us
so an example of how that trust won&#39;t
come easy is I think best evidenced by
the much mythologized and much
talked-about youthquake from this year&#39;s
general election which didn&#39;t really
seem to make that much of an appearance
cliche tells us that Trust takes an age
to build a moment to break and a
lifetime to repair young people like
middle-aged and older people have by and
large grown up in an age of mistrust in
order to repair that we have to build
community so this here is a portion of
my campaign team from this year&#39;s
general election they are a crew of
young people brought together by faith
and a better future but also wait for it
an idea worth spreading okay there was
good joke
their idea their idea is building
communities on the foundation of trust
is modeling participation by doing it
ourselves and trying to generate ripple
effects through our communities because
the fact of the matter is is that as
individuals you know we can donate to
charity or compost our waste or call up
talkback radio and have a bit of a go
but as a collective we can end
intergenerational poverty we can take
action on climate change and we can
build the foundations of tolerance
systemic change though requires trust
and the status quo approach Pfister&#39;s
and distrust a kind of mischievous
powerful wealthy and currently often
political class capitalized on our fear
other people it is a classic example of
divide and conquer and we have only to
look around and realize the common
interest that we all share and the power
that we have in numbers to disrupt it so
this leads me to my final point which is
that democracy is just a means not an
end unto itself in the words of Winston
Churchill democracy is the worst form of
government except for all of the others
it is literally just a tool to make
decisions decisions are almost always
compromises and compromises in our
society when a lot of people are at the
table have to be built on trust
Trust is founded in relationships in
communities and in good faith so I think
it&#39;s crucial to remember that our
politics does not start and end every
three years with a general election
respect breathes respect trust breeds
trust our politics lives in our
relationships with each other but also
and things are so perceivably small as
our daily challenges but as thing in
things as massive and monolithic as the
challenges of our time in summation
society is made up of citizens we as
citizens elect our politicians to make
decisions for us and to make the rules
essentially we expect those politicians
to be representatives of us so we should
expect them to come with our humanity
that means yeah with our ideals but also
with our flaws and I think that in
looking for the circuit breaker in order
to break the cycle of distrust perhaps
the best thing that you can do is look
to York
communities look around find someone who
you admire and trust and support them
and running for office
perhaps the People&#39;s Revolution looks
like a healthy dose of earnest naivety
and belief in our better nature my name
is Chloe Swarbrick and I am utterly
privileged to be one of your new MPs I
am 23 in case you weren&#39;t aware and I
have struggled with anxiety and
depression
I only just learned how to ride a
bicycle a few weeks ago and the reason
that I am telling you all of this is
because if I can do it you can do it too
