first let me start by acknowledging the
traditional owners on the land upon
which we meet today and thank you for
welcoming us to your land and given me
the opportunity to speak on your land
today and their elders past present and
emerging my name is julie anne Lamborn
and I&#39;m a Torres Strait Islander woman
now the Torres Strait Islands sit at the
top of Queensland just below Papua New
Guinea
my mother&#39;s father comes from the
western Torres Strait an island called
Moby Org Island and my mother&#39;s mother
comes from the eastern Torres Strait
you&#39;re a bailan sometimes known as darn
the island but I was born in Cannes
North Queensland today I&#39;m going to talk
about a subject that I&#39;m very passionate
about and then I&#39;m going to explain I
can&#39;t believe I&#39;m inside it what you&#39;re
seeing are children immersed on a mine
site watching trucks go by being in an
excavator a thousand times bigger than
they are but listening to a young
Aboriginal woman talk about why she
works in mining and how that has changed
her life what we did was we created five
employment immersive themes to create an
environment where people of all ages
could experience what it is like working
in those areas meet Rachel Rachel works
in mining rachel is only one of six in
the world to drive the largest
excavator they&#39;re huge um pain Rachel&#39;s
story is phenomenal growing up in a
small town but now renowned throughout
the world this is what those children
were watching meet Mario Mario is a
builder
he owns a construction company and what
they&#39;re watching in Mario&#39;s theme a
whole house is being built before their
very eyes behind them beside them up
cars are driving paths and a bridge is
being built meet uncle ray burns
uncle ray works on a banana farm in a
remote Aboriginal community in the Cape
but what they&#39;re hearing is if I can do
it you can do it here is an opportunity
for you to do something with yourselves
although Uncle Ray does say now I&#39;m in
your head that&#39;s a little bit scary why
did we do this when I grew up I grew up
in cans as I said before pristine
beautiful mountains where the rainforest
meets the reef people travel from all
over the world to come to Cannes so many
opportunities it&#39;s the land of
opportunity for some I grew up with no
guidance no support no mentoring never
knowing what was going to happen the
next day let alone knowing what my
future helped or what opportunities that
were in front of me let alone employment
but this is why we do what we do this is
why we formed envision group so we can
take those opportunities either in
virtual reality or face to face to
people who may not know to people who
may not have guidance we can help them
with guidance to people who don&#39;t have
the support where they&#39;re supporting
them holding them up helping them to
guide them how do we get it to those
people
how do we get it to remote locations how
do we get it to regional locations how
do we get it into the city what we did
was we built an all-terrain bus imagine
that a couple of women buying a cabinet
chassis and then telling the the
builders what to do but we wanted the
bus to go everywhere we didn&#39;t want the
bus we didn&#39;t want the technology in the
program to No Boundaries
we wanted it to reach the people in the
remotest location so that they could
experience advanced technologies and
they could learn about opportunities we
wanted it to go everywhere did I say I
mean everywhere thank God I don&#39;t I&#39;ve
the bus but what it provides is an
opportunity they see the bus rolling
into town we spread the word out and it
brings hope and it brings aspiration and
it brings opportunity into those
communities that it travels to this is
not just any normal bus and this is not
any normal virtual reality experience
when people are in that bus and they&#39;re
in their headsets it all feeds into a
server now that server produces what&#39;s
called to use a focus report so at any
given time any given second we can tell
how that person is engaged who were they
engaged with are they looking around are
they watching the house or are they
listening to that storyteller telling
them about why they do what they do why
do we do this because when we have a
post conversation so they go through the
five immersive themes they come through
to the other side and they may say oh I
loved mining because it&#39;s interactive
it&#39;s exciting but they&#39;re only
interacting with that storyteller for
25% if they were interacting with the
doctor and he&#39;ll
seventy-five percent and that&#39;s when the
conversation gets interesting because
they start to really bear down on why
they were interested in that
why were they interested in helping
people because other people they know
are sick that&#39;s why they want to study
that&#39;s why they want to go to health and
that&#39;s why we do that with those use
focus reports the bus actually is a
world first
there&#39;s not another bus like that
anywhere and that&#39;s come out of Cannes
Queensland Australia so why do we want
to go to remote community so this
community is similar to one of the
communities where you saw those children
this community is very remote very
secluded it takes them two days to drive
to their normal regional city they don&#39;t
have the experiences that we have they
might not know the opportunities that we
have they may have fear of leaving their
community no confidence lack of
education how would you feel if it took
you two days to drive to your nearest
Kmart and it takes them two days to
drive to their nearest Kmart so it&#39;s
about taking those opportunities to
those people who would never have that
I&#39;m gonna take you a little bit on a
journey of my life I gave you a little
insight about having no guidance my life
was full of turmoil as a child I grew up
with no opportunity I only knew abuse
psychological physical sexual abuse
domestic violence family violence
my father always worked but he
disciplined with an iron fist and my
mother was a chronic violent alcoholic
because of that I grew up with my own
shoes severe mental health anxiety
depression thoughts many attempts of
suicide not knowing where my next day
was where was my purpose I had no hope
at all but here I am today Here I am
today
overcoming all of those things not
knowing but now knowing being able to
impart what I know to other people
teaching them how to overcome this is
what drives me every day and these are
the principles of our organization
envision group and why we started
envision group to help all of those
people who have no idea but today I
stand here the CEO of envision Group
Incorporated I was number nine I was
actually a ward of the Kansas
businesswomen club that&#39;s have
indigenous businesswoman of the year and
just recently Australian Institute or
leaders and managers not-for-profit
leader for Cannes region for those to
have to have won those awards tend to
feel that benefit knowing where I came
from and not even completing junior high
school to completing a master&#39;s and
Business Administration and that&#39;s why I
do what I do and why we do what I do
with technology but can I tell you from
my own personal experience a person only
knows what they know until someone
provides an opportunity for them to see
beyond it so what we do is we see beyond
circumstance and we&#39;ve recognized
capability and we help them create the
life that they deserve thank you for
sharing in my journey
