well I have a confession to make
and that&#39;s that I am a car nerd I&#39;ve
been a car nerd all my life when I was
12 years old I read every car magazine
that I could find and I memorized the
zero to sixty times of every car in
there and the braking times and the tire
sizes and I could recall them it will
ask him ask me a question I had the
answer and I did it for years after
years after years could tell you all the
changes I was fascinated I also became
fascinated in engines and combustion and
I had access to technical papers before
I went into high school and I studied to
where I could describe the difference
between detonation and pre-ignition in
the combustion process now how many of
y&#39;all think back to your high school
years how many had a conversation about
the differences in detonation in
pre-ignition in the combustion cycle
okay it&#39;s like I thought zero me too but
I was prepared and and the truth is that
that I went on I realized if I wanted
any kind of social life I would need to
talk about more than cars and have a
broader a broader repertoire and the
truth is I really work to do that but in
my heart what I love and who I am and
where my passion is is around cars so
you&#39;ll understand why I think I have the
absolute best job in the world as the
managing director of triple A&#39;s
automotive engineering effort I have a
chance to drive one or two new cars a
week equipped with all the latest bells
and whistles the coolest stuff you can
get on a car it&#39;s really awesome I have
a chance to take cars to a racetrack or
a test facility and test one against
another or test multiple cars against
each other just and and not just to rank
one better than the other but to begin
to get an understanding of how they work
why they work why they do what they do
inform opinions that I can share with
motorists so they have an unbiased point
of view on what cars can do and they can
get the most out of their car in that
role I was recently driving a Volvo xc90
now I want to tell you a couple of
things about this car the first is it&#39;s
one of the five or six best cars that
have level 2 autonomous technology that
you can buy today and level 2 means that
the driver needs to be fully engaged in
the driving process have to keep your
hands on your wheel eyes on the road
it&#39;s not that the George Jetson stuff of
you know you can read a book watch a
video go to sleep while the car drives
itself that&#39;ll happen someday not today
the Volvo does all the tricks great it
can with the driver engaged it will
accelerate and break it&#39;ll turn keep you
from hitting the lines in the road where
it really shines is when things surprise
you so maybe a car pulls out
unexpectedly or a pedestrian steps out
in front of the car the Volvo is just
tremendous at tightening up the seatbelt
and stopping very quickly better than we
can as humans but the thing that stood
out to me the most might be
counterintuitive to you and that&#39;s that
that the car really knew its limitations
there is a particular road that I try to
drive cars on that have the ability to
self-center in the lane or or help avoid
collisions and if you can envision a
road with a long sweeping left-hand turn
and right in the middle of that turn it
opens up to to turn lanes a left and
right turn lane now cars that have this
technology use cameras to look at the
road to figure out where they are
spatially in the road so as long as you
have lines things are pretty good well
take those lines away and things start
to be a challenge and then add something
like a car setting in one of those lanes
and the radar is shooting out saying the
camera sees something the radar says
it&#39;s close you&#39;re closing on it cars
really challenged in this circumstance
and to me this is what I look for
because cars with this technology do
great 99% of the time it&#39;s that just
sliver over time that they have some
challenges and that&#39;s what I seek to
find and in this car which stood out to
me is this that it knew its limitations
it saw the roadway it let me know there
was a problem quickly it very seamlessly
handed control back over to me and kept
things safe and that gave me comfort
because if it knows its limitations then
it knows when it can what I should be
doing the driving and it knows when it&#39;s
capable of doing
felt really good about that so as you
might imagine I&#39;m really an advocate for
this I think there&#39;s tremendous
potential in in level 1 and level 2
autonomy and moving long term to level 3
and 4 but but the truth is is that not
all motorists are there triple-eight
conducted research and found that 90% of
drivers are afraid to share the road
with an autonomous car and 80% of
motorists are afraid to ride in a car
that has autonomous technology Wow
and there are actually people that have
collision avoidance and Lane centering
lane-keeping ability that are turning it
off in their car they have the
technology and they&#39;re turning it off
that&#39;s a real problem
so time for a little bit more insight
some additional research turned up
driver attitudes towards this stuff and
while the scope was pretty large i&#39;ll
categorize them as really three
categories there are drivers that just
don&#39;t think about it you know what they
probably peripherally know that there&#39;s
autonomous cars out there and they
probably heard something maybe good
maybe bad in the grand scheme of things
it&#39;s not very important to them there&#39;s
another category of people that maybe
they know a little bit about it but in
that moment of truth when they&#39;re buying
a car see when you check that box that
says yep I want lane-keeping assistance
that I want collision avoidance and all
those other things there&#39;s actually a
price tag associated with it
might be three thousand dollars or six
thousand dollars but at that moment of
truth
they decide it&#39;s not worth it and
there&#39;s a third category of people and
those are people that say you know what
cool stuff just not for me it&#39;s for the
other drivers well let&#39;s take a look at
that I&#39;d like to highlight some
differences between human drivers and
what cars are capable of they&#39;ve
designed properly the easiest way to do
that is to look at reaction time so when
you think about something that surprises
you in the roadway by the time you see
it process what you need to do about it
decide how you&#39;re gonna respond and then
let&#39;s say move your foot from the gas
pedal to the brake in round numbers
that&#39;s going to take a second and a half
so let me put some perspective on one
and a half seconds
one and a half seconds at 65 miles an
hour
think of a tractor trailer now think of
three tractor trailers end-to-end that&#39;s
how far you&#39;ll travel in a second and a
half at 65 miles an hour now let&#39;s think
about how the car responds to it from
the time the car senses a problem
processes that it needs to do something
and starts to apply the brakes is about
eight hundredths of a second in eight
hundreds of a second at 65 miles an hour
you travel about eight or nine feet so
maybe just a little bit further than I
am tall in my mind the potential of this
technology is tremendous but not
everybody feels the same way so we can
think of what is an average driver let&#39;s
think about that in a different sense
there&#39;s a term called illusory
superiority and psychologists would say
that we all think we&#39;re just a little
bit better than average so if you ask a
group of people are you good driver
average driver worse than average almost
everybody&#39;s a little bit better than
average maybe a lot better than average
okay
and we know average means half or better
and half or worse right
but people overestimate their
capabilities I&#39;d like to share with you
some of the folks that I work with a
team of dedicated individuals of
scientists and engineers that really do
most of the work and make so much of
what we do possible these individuals I
think would say that they&#39;re better than
average drivers but I might there&#39;s a
little bit more going on here two of the
individuals on the screen have NHRA
which is the Hot Rod Association drag
racing licenses one of them has Sports
Car Club of America a road racing
license so they&#39;re really pretty good
drivers to make my point I&#39;d like to
share a video and as this video plays
the one thing I&#39;d like you to do there&#39;s
gonna be a dragster in the car in the in
the video like you look at the light
right in front of the left front tire
when that light goes from yellow to
green that&#39;s when they have to
accelerate and really what determines a
winning race besides a good car is a
driver that can respond quickly so let&#39;s
take a quick look at this video
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so very cool reaction time three
hundredths of a second that&#39;s a whole
lot better than average top speed about
272 miles an hour now the individual
driving that was the lady on the
left-hand side of the screen meganlocke
earning that&#39;s her Top Alcohol dragster
and and it is an impressive sight I
would tell you her reactions are faster
than average she&#39;s certainly a better
driver than I am so we have a great
staff a great pool of people that we
work with in multiple locations and so
we challenge them kind of a fun
challenge there are cars out there that
can park themselves they can parallel
park themselves so wouldn&#39;t it be
interesting to see if
better-than-average drivers whether
they&#39;re proven better than average or
whether they&#39;re self-proclaimed could
beat a car at parking itself so we
picked five cars five drivers each
driver tried five times each car tried
five times and will figure out what we
come up with the truth is in the end of
the test the winner was able to park a
car ten percent faster was able to park
37 percent closer to the curb had 47%
fewer moves and did it with 81 percent
fewer curb strikes they hit the curb a
whole lot less yeah it was the car the
car beat are better than average drivers
and I go through this story because it&#39;s
important to note that the potential for
a car to really do good is there and
it&#39;s critically important that we think
about that because last year there were
37,000 people that died on the roadway
and motor accidents that&#39;s up 14% from
the year before these numbers are
increasing and it&#39;s estimated that 94
percent of those accidents were due to
human error so if we could there was
something in a car that could help us be
more safe and keep the people we love
and care about safe who wouldn&#39;t want
that be a great opportunity
cars are increasingly complex in the
cockpit there&#39;s more to learn they&#39;re
distracting more than ever we need this
type of assistance so the question
really comes up so what do we do where
do we go I don&#39;t think anybody could
disagree technology is there the need is
there I think there are three actions we
can take the first is really simple and
that&#39;s help people understand what we&#39;re
talking about you know today there&#39;s
terms like Intel a safe and eyesight and
supercruise which are really cool brand
names but they don&#39;t tell you a whole
lot about what to expect from the car
what if we were just a little bit more
clear about it and said you know what
this car will help you help prevent an
accident and it&#39;ll do it in a certain
way but if it said we can help you avoid
a collision with a pedestrian some can
some can but by managing those
expectations we set people up to enjoy
the experience to understand what their
cars can do what they need to do to make
it happen what&#39;s their role in all of
this and and they&#39;re not disappointed
when their cars actually work the second
thing we need to do is create advocates
so we don&#39;t need everybody sitting
around the Sunday dinner table talking
about sensor fusion and light our on a
chip what we need to do is get the
innovators in the early adaptors to
engage with this understand what&#39;s going
on and turn them into champions that
communicate to the broader audience
about the good things that this
technology can do and the third thing is
we need to educate consumers and engage
consumers in their cars and we need to
do this in a broad scope of things
whether it be stuff in the cockpit or
self-driving features autonomous
features but but you know you could say
well it&#39;s in the owners manual why not
take a look
owners manuals today or this thick and I
can promise you I read a lot of them
because they&#39;re entertaining right but
but but it&#39;s hard to figure out what it
is and what it&#39;s supposed to do and now
oftentimes it&#39;s not even in a book
anymore it&#39;s on a DVD maybe on the
internet there are actually cars today
that use odd
in reality to help the owner understand
how to use the features of their car
this is complex stuff so putting it in a
book or putting it online people aren&#39;t
reading it so let&#39;s take a new look I
recently bought a piece of technology
and when I bought it they they this
isn&#39;t a big stretch on where I went but
they actually sat down and showed me how
to use it they updated all the material
they showed me how to use it they asked
me some questions about what I
specifically did with it and then gave
me some tips on how to use it better
that was four thousand dollar piece of
technology couldn&#39;t we do that with a
car that cost thirty or fifty or sixty
thousand dollars maybe that&#39;s not the
model maybe it&#39;s not set down maybe what
we need to do is think of something like
a Geek Squad where somebody would come
to you and help you and your family
understand how to get the most out of
your car how to use it how to use it
safely how to contrast that with other
vehicles you have maybe that&#39;s the model
and there&#39;s a third model maybe maybe
that is we don&#39;t need to do books at all
we need to move towards gamification so
make it interesting to read an owner&#39;s
manual I want to see that that is way
cool but but the truth is is that the
way we&#39;re doing it now isn&#39;t working so
we need to do something better so I&#39;m
going to take my hat off for just a
second as a car nerd okay I&#39;m going to
talk to you as a husband and a father
and a friend and a neighbor 37,000
deaths it&#39;s unacceptable we can do
better than that
so if you agree with me I&#39;ve given you
three ideas that we can move forward on
if you agree let&#39;s get going let&#39;s do it
if you have better ideas let&#39;s have a
discussion but let&#39;s not stay where we
are because if we don&#39;t bring the driver
along with technology and engage them
and what&#39;s happening they&#39;re not going
to be with us they&#39;re not going to help
us implement the potential of this
technology there&#39;s ultimately no ride
without the driver thank you so much
you
[Applause]
