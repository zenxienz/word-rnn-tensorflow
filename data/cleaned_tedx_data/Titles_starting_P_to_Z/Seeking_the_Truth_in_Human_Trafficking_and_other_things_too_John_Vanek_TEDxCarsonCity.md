hello doesn&#39;t it seem like our world
gets more and more complex every day it
seems like every day we are bombarded
with these issues that impact our world
or our nation or our community many of
them can be very challenging to
understand sometimes they can even seem
overwhelming
now when life gets overwhelming it can
make sense to try and simplify things
but when we try and simplify complex
topics that can lead to over
simplification oversimplification has
brought us to a world where today much
of what we take in as knowledge or even
worse what we pass on as knowledge comes
from sound bites that we hear on radio
or TV or from Facebook posts from tweets
limited to 140 characters or from catchy
slogans that are designed to tell us
what to think but not why we should
think that way or even if it&#39;s true
Albert Einstein was a man who knew a lot
about a lot of complex things right and
his Albert Einstein who reminded us to
make everything as simple as possible
but no simpler you see if we really want
to understand the pressing issues of our
day we must be willing to embrace their
complexities let me give you an example
in the response to human trafficking
it&#39;s quite common that we see these big
numbers about how many people are
enslaved in our world you may have seen
some of these numbers before for many
years the most commonly quoted estimate
was 21 million people this estimate was
released several years ago by the
International Labour Organization they
are an agency of the United Nations but
then a couple of years ago a private
organization called the walk free
foundation released what they call their
global slavery index and they said the
number was much higher as high as 46
million people enslaved but just last
month the International Labour
Organization in partnership with walk
free issued a brand new estimate they&#39;ve
adjusted the number downward a little
bit now estimating that 40 million
people in our world are enslaved 40
million women men and children either
enslaved or in what we call slave-like
conditions now I have to ask you what
does 40 million people even look like I
have a very difficult time trying to
comprehend how massive a number that is
if I try to make sense of it just just
for my own use and I try to come up with
some sort of analogy the best that I&#39;ve
been able to come up with and admittedly
it&#39;s not very good as I look at the
entire state of California and realized
that the population is roughly 40
million people if we&#39;re curious about
how many victims exist only in the
United States there&#39;s even more
confusion the walk free foundation they
estimated that there were about 57,000
victims in the United States but earlier
this year the University of Texas at
Austin they released their report
examining human trafficking only in the
state of Texas and they believed that in
Texas alone there may be as many as
three hundred and thirteen thousand
victims of trafficking you see the
numbers are all over the place the fact
is is that we just don&#39;t know yet we
like to take these numbers without any
other information or context and push
them out to try and inspire people to
respond against human trafficking do you
think it works I don&#39;t think so and
there&#39;s also some other problems with
these numbers the first is that we have
to realize is that they are broad
estimates at best
there are extrapolations based on very
limited data one of the real problems we
have in the response to trafficking is
that we lack centralized protocols and
mechanisms when we can report when we
find an actual victim of human
trafficking or we arrest an actual
trafficker or we take that trafficker to
court and prosecute them hopefully
convicting them on actual human
trafficking charges these mechanisms do
not exist in the United States nor do
they exist globally the second problem
with these numbers is they don&#39;t tell us
that there&#39;s actually a segment of the
population that believe these numbers
are vastly overinflated and that we have
all been spending way too much time
energy passion and money in the response
to this problem but from where I stand
the biggest problem with these numbers
is they don&#39;t tell us anything about
human trafficking they don&#39;t even tell
us what it is human trafficking or
modern slavery is defined as taking a
person and then exploiting their labor
or some other services they can perform
or exploiting them through the
commercial sex trade through the use of
force or fraud or coercion force fraud
or coercion now force I think is a
pretty simple concept we can all
understand we can all appreciate how the
threat of force or the actual use of
force might compel us to do something we
would not otherwise normally do fraud is
also fairly simple to understand because
in the context of human trafficking
fraud typically speaks to a financial
arrangement between the trafficker and
their victim it&#39;s quite common to find
situations where the trafficker loans
money to the victim and then expects the
victim to repay that debt through their
labor but the trafficker has created a
financial scheme an illegal
scheme in which the victim may never be
able to repay that money in some extreme
cases that debt can be passed on to the
next generation and even the next it can
go on forever but coercion coercion is a
more complex concept because coercion
speaks to the victims state of mind
what&#39;s the victim thinking it&#39;s
important that we realize that in modern
slavery very few victims are held
against their will physically they are
not tied up or in Chains they&#39;re not
blocked behind fences with barbed wire
they are walking freely amongst us they
stay in their situation of exploitation
because of the powerful coercive control
held by their trafficker they stay in
situations that you are I would
absolutely flee I only have time to give
you one example of coercion but it&#39;s a
very powerful example and it&#39;s also a
very common example particularly in that
sector of the human of human trafficking
that that&#39;s the commercial sex trade a
trafficker will tell their victim that
they love them they love and they will
also tell their victim if you love me in
return tonight you will go out and you
will have sex with as many people as you
can for money and you will bring me back
that money so then I can provide us with
a warm place to sleep and food to eat
now this isn&#39;t love it&#39;s a perversion of
the concept of love but we have to
understand that this victim may have
never ever known true love in their
entire life they may have never known
true caring and compassion and as a
result they are deathly afraid of losing
the love of their trafficker so as a
result they will go out tonight they
will have sex with as many people as
they can and they will give that money
to the trafficker
we need to understand that modern
slavery is it&#39;s limited by only two
things the imagination and the coercive
skill of the trafficker if I can think
of ways to make money by exploiting you
or you or you then all I need to do is
figure out what are the coercive buttons
I need to push on you and you and you
this is why if my good friend and
colleague Andy who is a federal
prosecutor and who has successfully
prosecuted cases of human trafficking
reminds us that human trafficking is a
state of mind crime and that we must all
have an appreciation for the coercive
power everybody involved in the response
from the victim advocate who&#39;s going to
try and help that victim move on and
life free of exploitation to the police
investigator who&#39;s going to be talking
to that victim and probably wondering
why did you stay in that situation so
long to the prosecutor who has to
explain this in court to the judge and
ultimately to the public at large
because it&#39;s from the public that we
gain our jurors you see we all have to
have an appreciation for that coercive
control that can keep some people in
situations that you or I would never
dream we could find ourselves in now
before I leave you with my closing
thoughts I&#39;d like us all to pause for a
moment and just think about some of the
other pressing issues of our day that
impact our world or our nation or our
community climate change energy
dependency health care immigration
conflicts at home and abroad all of
these and other issues have proponents
and opponents based on our perspective
right each of whom are trying to take
these complex issues and distill them
into simple choices of right or wrong
good or bad just or unjust
true or false they they try to paint us
into corners where seemingly our only
choices are to either completely agree
or completely disagree they neglect to
tell us about the good work that happens
when people meet in the middle and share
their passion and their knowledge and
we&#39;re real effective change can happen
so I would urge you if any of these
important issues that we&#39;re talking
about many of which we are talking about
today if they resonate within you
embrace their complexities study them
really learn talk to other people that
have different opinions or perspectives
than yours and don&#39;t talk about Facebook
slogans or snappy slogans talk about
actions and solutions actions and
solutions I&#39;m afraid I have to leave you
with a confession I do not know how to
respond to the problem of 40 million
people being enslaved in our world today
that number is too big it&#39;s too vast
it&#39;s too complex but what I would like
to leave you with is this it&#39;s what I&#39;ve
learned from my work and what I&#39;ve
learned is that these are not the
numbers we should be focused on we
should be focusing on the number one
because when my colleagues and I come
together and we share our expertise and
our passion and we commit to working
together even though we don&#39;t always
agree on everything then together we
come up with real actions and solutions
actions and solutions that will help
that one victim we&#39;re trying to help
today or that one prosecutor or the one
investigator who&#39;s investigating that
one case that might make a really big
difference we can help that one
community seeking the one initiative
that will reduce the prevalence see in
their communities we
make a difference one at a time you see
this is real this is effective and this
is the best way to respond to modern
slavery so we can all make a difference
if we&#39;re just willing to embrace these
complexities because don&#39;t you see it&#39;s
only when we embrace the complexities
that we learned the truth about human
trafficking and other things - thank you
very much
