you
you
video games they&#39;ve been here for
decades since 1958 and we still judge
them as one of the bad things in our
society that they&#39;re addictive expensive
even violent and that they can&#39;t teach
and that bears with it the stereotype of
an obese person living in their parents
basement but none of that couldn&#39;t be
further from the truth
all of these are assumptions created by
many societies in order to demote video
games video games can teach first I
would like to bring to light Shigeru
Miyamoto creator of Super Mario Brothers
he invented what people call the
learning curve basically the learning
curve is how you learn to play a game so
let&#39;s begin you start the game you&#39;re on
the far left of the screen all this open
space giving you a sense of where to go
you move you hit this middle of the
screen you start to pan the camera
starts to pan with you suddenly a Goomba
appears you don&#39;t know what to do but
and you touch it you die luckily there&#39;s
no much of a penalty so you can start
over again you go you&#39;re moving move
move this time knowing to jump over the
Goomba but you accidentally hit one of
the blocks above you a coin pops out yay
coins let&#39;s hit all the blocks yeah
mushroom you instinctively moved to the
side but the mushroom bounces off a
cleverly placed pipe it touches you but
you grow bigger stronger less vulnerable
to attacks and like that you&#39;ve learnt
all the mechanics of Mario yay
another thing we learn is challenge it
teaches us to avoid the wrong challenges
and to take the right ones for example
when you start a game you never think
I&#39;m gonna beat that final boss with
nothing on me you don&#39;t even have
experienced weapons anything you&#39;re just
going to be slaughtered it teaches you
to get better and then prepare yourself
from for the actual challenge ahead
rather than rather than taking a silly
challenge it helps you to avoid and take
the right challenges another thing it
does is it trains your frontal cortex
and your left frontal I&#39;ll OBE
now the frontal eye lobe corresponds
with hand-eye coordination the frontal
cortex is practically our CPU where we
may go and process all the information
it&#39;s where we make our decisions now the
left frontal lobe corresponds to
controllers so when we&#39;re playing a
video game we almost never look at our
controllers that&#39;s because the left
frontal eye has already mapped every
single button on your controller so it&#39;s
all up to the frontal cortex to put in
get the right input and click the right
button giving you all the movements
within succession some video games are
so fast that all these movements are
like reflex I play Sonic Unleashed and I
have to do this within milliseconds now
our final point the end goal the
satisfaction when we complete a
challenge we as humans love the
satisfaction we crave that flower final
feeling to have those bragging rights to
have that feeling but then when we do it
again it makes the journey all the more
fun it&#39;s amazing we crave it but
nowadays there are people who have jobs
that they can&#39;t even care less they&#39;re
only doing it so they can sustain their
life so they can keep their families
happy and no one really wants to do
something they don&#39;t like to do but
video games give us this crave for the
journey crave for the satisfaction in
the end and if we could make life and
work just as fun then video games will
be the best thing we&#39;ve ever played in
life thank you
