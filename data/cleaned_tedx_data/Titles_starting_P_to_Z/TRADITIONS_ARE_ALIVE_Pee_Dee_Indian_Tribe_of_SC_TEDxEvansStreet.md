I&#39;d like to introduce some over here is
Mike Dunn his wife dapping Daphne and
John Lynch the tribe has been here for a
long time we finally got organized back

seventy six to nine to 2000 2006 we
became state recognized we&#39;re one of the
ten tribes in South Carolina that is
actually recognized as a tribe South
Carolina did not recognize Indians up to
2005 so I&#39;d like to thank y&#39;all for
being here I&#39;d like to give honor to the
to the Creator for having us here for
allowing us to be here people thought we
would stink thought we was gone but we
also simulated into the white people
world through the settlers we became
farmers we became slaves we became other
things our nationality or our history or
our census when they took us they didn&#39;t
put down Indian they put out with either
the word mulatto black or others but
we&#39;re a Native Americans we&#39;re proud PD
Indians
and we&#39;re here and we want to thank each
and every one here today we&#39;re giving
this opportunity to show some of our
traditional dances these are some of the
actual clothing that we wore back then a
lot of people think that we wore leather
blue ribbons and our old life gather on
today
but we would back we didn&#39;t have we
didn&#39;t use the leather because back then
we had to trade our deer highs to get
food and ammunition so we&#39;re actually we

Hey okay at this time we like I just
like to say that um the PD tribe of
South Carolina we&#39;ve got a lot going for
us now
we&#39;re having a our culture restored
we&#39;re gonna start back classes with the
language and get to try to get the
language we realized again and our
traditional dances I know you&#39;ve
probably some of you&#39;ve probably been to
powwows and powers it&#39;s kind of like a
pan Indian where the dancers you see or
mainly actually came from Oklahoma area
but each individual tribe had their own
traditional dances and so we&#39;re trying
to bring back the traditional stuff at
this time and hopefully with our
language restored and the dances and all
it&#39;ll make us a complete tribe again
where we&#39;ve had to borrow from other
tribes in the past but there are
research that we&#39;ve done on our own
people we&#39;ve learned that uh we have a
lot of things that we need to learn and
incorporate back into our tribe so we&#39;re
thankful for you guys letting us come
out and be a part of this and she&#39;s if
there any questions out like I said we
are the PD Indian tribe of South
Carolina we have been here Hernandez
Hernandez the Spanish came up here in
1492 and he found to try here and they
called us BD instead of PD we are named
the river there&#39;s great PD River is
named after our tribe we are a PD tribe
that&#39;s been in this area here right
within ten miles from here at the PD
River we used to have a big village
there
and we had a lot of activity even in the
1900 1910 1920 1930 in upton 1950 we had
a village there and the pd people were
there and i grow by their yesterday
leaving here and I couldn&#39;t find a sign
at all about our people being here so my
goal is now to find out what I have to
do to get some type of historical marker
there we did a lot of trading there the
settlers when they was settled they
settled down around Charleston
Georgetown in that area and they came up
to PD River and we traded with them and
in them though in those areas there
there&#39;s no historical market about the
PDS we are here we were here and we&#39;re
going to stay here we&#39;re going to grow
we&#39;re going to learn our actual cultures
and I actually dressings we have seen
much so much powwow things goes on and
they&#39;re good they&#39;re good they help the
tribe to gain momentum money and all
these things but we want to learn our
own culture our own history and there&#39;s
so much here in this area that we live
in in Florence County Darlington County
Marlborough Carolyn Marion County the P
DS has a big activity with there at one
time and it&#39;s ads my heart to see that
we&#39;re we&#39;re no we&#39;re not recognized
anymore so I I pray that the Creator
would give us a way to do things we want
to do it right we&#39;re not trying to take
nothing back or anything like that we
want to be recognized that we were here
and there are so many towns and so many
businesses that has the word PD on it I
wonder if they really knew what the PD
was and who we were we were human being
we were people just like everybody else
like I said our people were the first
tribes on the southeast coast
was hit by the settlers we would almost
not elated we was almost wiped out and
the reason we we actually stayed here is
because we married into the white
settlers and the settlers into the Irish
into the Germans into all these that&#39;s
how we&#39;re still here there are very few
full-blooded Indians around anymore but
I am Native American if I got 1% of
Native American I&#39;m Indian and I like to
thank everyone and we give you the honor
and the glory amen
