they told me to enjoy the moment so I&#39;m
taking that moment how would you feel if
your phone suddenly went dark how would
you feel if you no longer had access to
your bank account how would you feel if
you drove home tonight and your brakes
no longer worked now imagine that this
didn&#39;t just happen to you it happened to
millions of people all over our country
and potentially millions more all over
the world at the same time what would
you do about that what would we do about
that technology has transformed our
lives at a dizzying pace we depend on it
for essentials now our cell phone our
Wi-Fi we rely on it for convenience
making a dinner reservation remotely
starting your car and pretty soon
technology will literally drive us to
dinner we are wild eyed with excitement
about the unprecedented ease and
convenience the technology is ushered
into our lives but at the same time we
are blind to the threat of cyber
security and how it can impact our lives
with the click of a mouse
target Sony wanna cry
all three are examples of cyber attacks
that impact us at work and at play
nothing is immune from a cyber attack
not even our democratic form of
government if Winston Churchill were
alive today he would probably say that
the cyber threat is a riddle wrapped in
a mystery inside an
now look we live in an economy that&#39;s
based on competition companies are
obsessed with bringing the most
innovative products to market as fast as
possible
security that&#39;s an afterthought the
tension between the private sector and
the government is this the private
sector wants to bring products to market
for profit meanwhile the government is
mandated to provide security without
regard to cost this tension is best
exemplified in the Sony hack in 2014
Sony was going to release a film that
was a parody of the North Korean leader
the ensuing attack literally shut down
the company in an eerie foreshadowing of
last year&#39;s DNC hack the hackers
released emails from Sony executives
that disparaged Angelina Jolie and Adam
Sandler the hackers even threatened any
theater that dared to show the film that
they would be attacked and it further
delayed the release of the film
what started as a hack transformed
itself into an assault on our First
Amendment rights by a nation-state so
here comes the US government they
publicly said it was the fault of the
North Korean government and they vowed a
proportionate response so shortly
thereafter the entire North Korean
internet was temporarily shut down but I
have to be honest with you I&#39;m not sure
who exactly gets to use the North Korean
Internet
connectedness is another way that brings
the cyber threat into very sharp focus
super connectedness provides
unprecedented ease and convenience I can
whip out my cell phone I can use an app
I can order lunch organic no less and
have it delivered this theater probably
within an hour conversely that same
super connectedness also means that the
cyber threat can adversely impact more
people faster in a shorter amount of
time than ever before so the question is
how do we respond to this challenge this
simple but not easy answer is proactive
private sector government collaboration
such collaboration means real-time
access to and sharing of cyberthreat
and attack information with the purpose
of mitigating the consequences of an
attack think of it this way your
friend&#39;s bank is hacked in the morning
it&#39;s some malicious email that&#39;s fake
but because the bank is collaborating
with the government and the other banks
they&#39;re able to transmit out a warning
as a result the attack on your friend&#39;s
Bank in the morning is less likely to be
an attack on your bank in the afternoon
now I know what you&#39;re thinking oh this
sounds great in theory but in practice
it&#39;s like Billy Joel the piano man wrote
it&#39;s a matter of trust the private
sector looks upon the government with
suspicion over things like one should
you even call the government if you get
hacked too should the government have
the right to unlock your iPhone three
should there be regulation over
artificial intelligence and robots
now the skeptics might say well this
kind of collaboration is impossible but
we as a society we already do it without
even thinking about it how many of you
have up
loaded real-time traffic information to
the app Waze how many more of us are
gonna access that real-time information
on the way home from the theater tonight
to find the best route home to avoid
traffic now in the cyber world the best
example of this proactive collaboration
is in the financial services industry
they call them an information sharing an
analysis center yes I&#39;m going to use an
acronym it&#39;s called an I sack what the I
sack is designed to do it&#39;s a platform
and it allows the government and
industry representatives to have access
to and to share real-time attack
information and they work together to
respond to the threat or the attack but
what it also does is it allows people to
create relationships think how much more
difficult would it be to respond to a
cyber attack if the team that you&#39;re
going to put out on the field they&#39;ve
never worked together before and now
you&#39;re gonna ask them to respond to a
cyber attack flawlessly under the stress
of the situation cybersecurity is as
serious as a heart attack and we need to
treat it that way
target Sony wanna cry more recently
let&#39;s add SEC Equifax there are all
symptoms that if left untreated will
undoubtedly at some point result in an
economic heart attack or possibly
something worse in this case the doctor
is prescribing proactive collaboration
do we really want to find out from an
economic heart attack that you know what
we should have listened to the doctor&#39;s
orders I don&#39;t think so because too much
is at stake innovation happens so fast
now that it is literally overwhelmed our
ability to comprehend and understand its
long-term consequences
this is especially true in cybersecurity
particularly as it relates to the
balance between innovation and our
security let me ask you the following
two questions question one what do you
think the balance is between the benefit
of artificial intelligence and robots
versus the danger and potential
destruction of the t1000 and the drones
that made arnold schwarzenegger famous
in the Terminator movies question 2 how
does government smartly respond to the
complicated interconnected systems that
are required to operate self-driving
cars but also maintain this appropriate
level of security in a way this is a
trick question because what I&#39;m really
asking you to do is please put on your
turn signal and we&#39;re gonna temporarily
exit the innovation superhighway and
we&#39;re gonna pause pause so that we can
wrap our head around the long term
consequences of innovation on our
security now we&#39;re in the 21st century
we&#39;re barely 17 years in we&#39;ve dealt
with terrorism financial meltdowns
multiple natural disasters we are ready
for the cyber challenge now it&#39;s going
to require this proactive collaboration
but it also means that we as a society
need to engage in an open and honest
debate about the consequences of
innovation on our security and that
debate begins with you right now so the
next time that you purchase an Alexa or
pretty soon it&#39;s gonna be your first
self-driving car pause for a moment
consider what has been built into that
platform to protect your privacy and
provide for your ongoing security thank
you
