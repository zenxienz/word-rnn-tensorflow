The Blob alien Dracula Annabelle I love
horror and it&#39;s not just me I know a
good number of you here today loved
horror - but what is it that we love
about horror is it the monsters is it
the scares is it cuz it&#39;s slimy and
sometimes you&#39;re just watching you and
you&#39;re like what the hell is going on
here well yeah it&#39;s all those things and
that&#39;s what makes Horace our great you
see horror is this ambiguous and
slippery thing and it&#39;s monsters
manifests the anxieties we have in our
world I believe that if we can better
understand our culture&#39;s monsters we can
better understand the cultures anxieties
and as an artist rather than be
conflicted by this I think we should
embrace it and see what we can create
from it and why should we embrace this
well let me start by telling you a few
things about myself so I&#39;m a third
culture kid a third culture kid is
someone who has for the most part of
their life grown up in a culture other
than their parents and as a result of
their upbringing you develop a culture
of your own a third culture mine was a
confusing blend of being Chinese
Australian of religion desire fantasy
and anxiety sir when I was about 20 I
was diagnosed with social anxiety as
well as my um purring because you know
when you&#39;re growing up in a different
culture than the one that you look like
you&#39;re supposed to fit into it kinda
makes it quite difficult to figure out
where you belong and so when I had my
social anxiety as a result it made
things like going on the bus going to
university things like this talk really
really really difficult to manage so a
great theorist once that we can read
cultures by the monsters they engender
you see things that we fear our desires
our anxieties and fantasies these things
all give life to the monster and for me
exploring the idea of the monster and
the monstrous has to come a way for me
to exercise my anxieties through art I
come from a personal place and horror
was my safe space coming from a
conservative and religious background
my interest in horror was seen as more
harmful than helpful but that sort of
negative response to something I really
really enjoyed naturally made me more
curious it was a way for me to rebel
against the image I was supposed to live
so social anxiety controlled my life and
I spent a lot of time afraid to leave
the house so I just spent a lot of time
at harm and when you&#39;re spending time at
harm what do you do you&#39;re on your
laptop so I spent so much time watching
hard films secretly and I found that I
actually sympathize or empathize more
with Western horror than I did with
Eastern horror because those narratives
those images they did actually scare me
it was more comfortable for me to see a
white person on the screen than the
Chinese looking person because that was
the last thing I wanted to be confronted
with with being Chinese so why do we
watch horror for me I like being
disgusted for me whore allowed me to be
curious to check out disgusting and
fantastical things without actually
getting a lawyer for myself think about
like pimple popping videos and things
like that you know I&#39;m talking about
right
so horror holds it&#39;s a lure that makes
us want to turn our heads away but in
that act of turning heads away we want
to see more horror monsters in
particular I&#39;m not only designed to be
threatening but threatening based on the
current fears we hold so let&#39;s take a
Nightmare on Elm Street for example
writer director Wes Craven was inspired
by a series of news articles he read in
the 80s about a group of South East
Asian refugees who mysteriously died in
their sleep as a result many people
refused to sleep and Craven took that
and translated that fear into something
uncontrollable nightmares were seen as
killers and Freddy Krueger was born if
we put ourselves in the shoes of those
people at the time the anxiety to sleep
is very real what happens if we fall
asleep it&#39;s the fear of the unknown that
drives our anxiety in horror 80s classic
the blog was also apparently inspired by
a news report from the 50s about a
sergeant and patrolman who stumbled
across a mysterious slime so when they
touched the flooring because totally you
would touch them mister
slam it began dissolving and by the time
the FBI came the slime had fully
dissolved and always left was a stain on
the ground that report then led to
theories of dissolving flying saucers
than aliens and of course invasions but
that grew we now know that that goo was
most likely a slime mold called star
jelly a natural phenomenon that still
surprises people today see that anxiety
felt in the 50s a time where sci-fi and
horror translated the threat of Cold War
invasions and the ends of the American
Way of life
into flying saucers and invasions can be
explained by logic now but back then it
was a very real anxiety sea monsters
like Dracula The Walking Dead The Blob
embody anxieties so well because they
are complicated they contradict what we
know of species they are other dead or
alive hybrids or just completely
impossible to categorize I find the most
complex and exciting monster to be the
type of monster that flies through our
fingers when we think we finally caught
it the blob monster type so slime
becomes a symbolic of an ungraspable and
bigger with slippery horror in my work
it changes shape it&#39;s slippery and messy
and multi-layered third culture I would
argue instills anxiety because in and of
itself it disrupts what&#39;s complete and
pure because it can be so many things at
once
but if we think about it slime is also
super sexy it&#39;s shiny its sticky its
seductive and it&#39;s not necessarily
threatening in itself you know things
like ice cream and honey and chocolate
all can be described as slimy but aren&#39;t
threatening I mean they&#39;re quite
attractive so if we mess it up a bit
compare and combine it with the
threatening flame with the attractive
Slom we are confronted with a complexity
that pushes the threatening into the
alluring and the alluring into the
threatening I think this is my way of
dealing or accepting anxiety in my work
to get that troop of chocolate
strawberry topping and smother the whole
thing with it to bring symbolism from my
culture and distorted with the hope of
understanding it by confronting it here
I&#39;ve used the peach which is a popular
symbol of love and life from my culture
it&#39;s not the mystic symbol but I&#39;ve
manipulated it to become a bit more
squirmy by covering in a texture that
looks like it&#39;s oozing blue for live
erotic pause I want my work to party in
the center of the threatening and the
attractive so to embrace that complexity
and translate anxiety as my normal and
although we can represent the monster
through film literature and art it never
actually resolves the anxiety sure the
monster can be defeated but he often
returns whether it&#39;s escaped or smuggled
as the undead or sequel
it&#39;s able to shift just as our social
psychological and environmental
anxieties do just like my anxieties do
as a third culture kid as it&#39;s never
fully reconciled the result is we are
left to embrace anxiety so what can we
do with this we can appreciate it and
create something productive in that
difference in the case of the fly Jeff
Garlin&#39;s character Seth Brundle he goes
through this crazy transformation he
essentially goes through like adult
puberty from human to human fly he
starts losing limbs he starts mutating
he loses genitalia but he doesn&#39;t freak
out instead embraces that difference and
turns it into a productive difference he
blessed himself with a new name
brundlefly
he turns his back on cabin air into a
Museum of his own bodily transformations
he checks himself out in the mirror of
the exciting new possibilities with my
work the intention is to use the
threatening and attractive sides of
slime to reveal the darker sides of
culture so that we can rethink how we
read culture and comfort by taking what
is traditionally defined as cute
seductive and form it into something
alien then kind of dowsing then a little
taste of horror the result will be
something that sits in the position of
brundlefly or it kind of just hangs out
in the middle of what&#39;s attractive and
what we find repulsive see horror
monsters draw from the opportunities
ambiguity contains an instead of being
uneasy about the unknown the
uncontrollable let&#39;s explore what we can
create with it that was it
thank you
