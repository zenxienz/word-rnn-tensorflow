hello and welcome thank you all for
coming out I really really appreciate it
and we all do appreciate it here at
Seattle you my name is Wil tipping I&#39;m
actually a strategic communications
major it&#39;s close to marketing but more
so deals in communication and rhetoric
and what I&#39;m here to talk to you about
today is my experience with public
service and what it&#39;s taught me and also
what it showed me about the power of
youth and so I want to start out by
giving a little story about me and my
friend specifically my friend Edie and
so when I was in high school for a long
time I sort of lived my life in this
little bubble of privilege this
comfortable bubble growing up in
Minneapolis and I had the chance to meet
this man while I worked at this grocery
store and I opened the grocery store

every morning at 6:00 in the morning and
this man was waiting outside for me
every morning because he had slept on
the street the previous night his name
was Edie and Edie was the most amazing
man that I&#39;ve ever met Edie took the

time with me at 6:00 a.m. when I&#39;m
sitting there cashiering at a grocery
store that nobody&#39;s in ed and I sat
together and we had conversations about
life we talked about goals we talked
about dreams and for a 16 year old
angsty teen that was the most important
thing for me to have somebody to talk to
to have somebody to work through life
with and I&#39;ll never forget this the day
that I left for college I told that that
I was graduating and the pride that he
showed the interest that he showed was
far beyond any sort of interest I had
ever seen from any member of my family
any member of my friend group he was
just genuinely proud of me and that
touched me so deeply because Edie took
the time regardless of his situation
regardless of what he was going through
he was sleeping on the street every
night he had no home but he took the
time to get to know me he
the time to take an interest in me a
genuine interest and so from there
forward I took this very very important
stance on helping people who are
homeless people who are impoverished and
I started to work towards becoming a
community servant and so when I came to
Seattle I had it in my heart to help as
many people as I could circumvent this
situation and so what I&#39;ve seen in
popular media representation is this
idea that youth are well exactly what I
was generally unconcerned selfish lazy
and that&#39;s what publications talk about
when they talk about our generation
Generation X Millennials Generation Y
that&#39;s all they&#39;re saying and this
constant repetition of this rhetoric
causes us to self define and one of the
things we talked about in Communication
Studies is the idea of the behavioral
theory of communication and one of the
basic tenets of that is that if you
don&#39;t see behavior and if it&#39;s not
validated then that behavior ceases to
continue and so I wanted to tell you a
little bit about my career in service as
I&#39;ve come to Seattle and what that
showed me and it&#39;s been exactly the
opposite about the youth and so I&#39;ll
start with South South Central Los
Angeles and the Sierra service project
and so when I was a freshman in college
my summer was spent down in South Los
Angeles helping people to get around the
ideas that people were poor but they
were that that was their fault and so I
spent this time working with the Sierra
service project which is a nonprofit
that showed that allowed people to have
free renovations and free repairs to
their homes and so from there I worked
with these groups of youth these 10
groups of youth I was the construction
coordinator up
there and so I would go out into the
community meet these clients have a good
conversation with them ask them what
their needs were and these were folks
who needed desperately home renovations
or business renovations but just
couldn&#39;t afford to get it done and what
we were able to do with the cierra
service project was we brought in ten
different groups of youth over three
months and these youth literally paid a
fee to come out and do service and they
believed so fervently in helping others
they believed so passionately in helping
others that they were willing to spend
their hard-earned summer money to come
down and change the possibilities for
others living in difficult situations
and so over the course of that summer we
were able to get 50-plus projects done
in South Los Angeles whether this was a
new roof a new coat of paint a
wheelchair ramp or somebody who needed a
shed in their back yard these youth
didn&#39;t know these people at all had no
prior connection to them came out and
changed the situation&#39;s for a bunch of
different people over the course of the
summer and so I started to combine and
create this certain passion for working
with youth and I started to see the
selflessness the selflessness but at the
same time all that I had heard in media
and popular media was oh the youth are
selfish the youth are unconcerned the
youth are lazy and so I carried that
forward and one thing I&#39;ve spent doing
in Seattle over the past four years is
working at Bailey gasser Elementary and
it barely gets to elementary a recent
study that&#39;s been published about this
school is that one in five students are
homeless one in five elementary school
students are homeless and many of them
additionally are dealing with very
unstable housing situations and great
levels of poverty and in these
situations what I&#39;ve been able to do is
work with these students as a volunteer
tutor for four years now
and I work in the literacy program and
what I&#39;ve seen from these youth has been
for one their unrelenting consistency in
stretching out their school day what my
program is is two hours extra at the end
of the day so these students are getting

here at 7:00 in the morning they&#39;re
getting to school and they decide to

stretch their school day till 4:00 p.m.

and sometimes 4:30 or 5:00 and so these
youth are taking into account the fact
that they want to turn their lives
around they want to make something
better for their community they want to
make something better for their families
and they&#39;re willing to stretch their
school day to work with me or work with
any of the other students at the gasur
program to be to have a better chance at
succeeding to have a better chance to go
forward and make positive community
change and given that that leads me into
my last story as well and so last summer
I spent working with the United Way of
King County and the AmeriCorps and what
we were able to do in the Central
District of Seattle was set up programs
known as summer meal programs and so
students had the ability to come for one
or two or even three square meals a day
at these parks during the summer we also
additionally offered academic enrichment
for them to combat that summer learning
loss and what really really shocked me
and touched me about this program was
though I was completely overwhelmed at
this drop-in site where there was no
parental supervision these students were
coming from wherever they could to get
some food and
you know have some somebody to look up
to some adults to hang out with the
students that were benefiting from this
program were additionally helping me
around the site and I&#39;ll never I will
never forget this because I could not
understand the level of selflessness
that it takes to be benefiting from a
program and at the same time be so
available and ready to help others and
help others have a better summer help
others have a summer without hunger and
so that&#39;s been all of these experiences
have showed me that if we don&#39;t consider
continue to to challenge this negative
representation that we see about younger
generations the youth as well as our
negative perceptions of how we see the
homeless how we see people who are
impoverished how we see people who are
going through tough situations in life
then we&#39;re never going to get around
that idea and so we have to focus around
youth and youth have the most amazing
and bright ideas from what I&#39;ve seen
it&#39;s completely contrary to what what
the media presents about us each and
every day and so I asked to my youth to
my younger generations I want you to
know you have the power to change the
world you have the most fresh idea you
have the freshest take on everything you
approach everything with such such life
and to my older generations thank you
thank you thank you for without you we
wouldn&#39;t be here but in addition we need
EDS we need those Ed&#39;s
we need you to be those ads for other
for other youth and so I guess in
conclusion we need to Center ourselves
around the power of youth and that
transitional and that transformative
power that we have is the only way that
we&#39;re going to end the situations that
are have
in Seattle and I don&#39;t really need to
explain it I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all aware of
the situation that&#39;s going on in Seattle
now but people are being pushed out of
their homes people are being evicted in
order to gentrify and build and that
can&#39;t be allowed to continue we need to
focus our attention on bridging this
generational gap that has become this
generational gap that has for so long
divided us old and young and we need to
meet in the middle and once we meet in
the middle there&#39;s no there&#39;s no
possibility there&#39;s no end to the
possibilities that we can create
together thank you so much
[Applause]
