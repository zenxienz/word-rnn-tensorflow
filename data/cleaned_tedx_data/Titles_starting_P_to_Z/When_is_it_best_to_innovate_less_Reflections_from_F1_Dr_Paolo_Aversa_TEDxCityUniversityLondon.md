so the little story gonna tell you about
today starts with a picture exactly with
this picture now the little man that you
see there is actually myself at a time
when I still had hair and and the
picture was shot exactly on June 27 1984
and it was my second birthday so you do
the math and you know how old I am and
on that day I received from my father
a beautiful Ferrari pedal car and that&#39;s
pretty much the only Ferrari I owned
since then you know my father is an
engineer not a Formula one engineer but
he&#39;s a Motorhead and is a big fan of
Formula One so since I was a kid he

would wake me up you know a 3:00 a.m.

4:00 a.m. with an excuse of having a
gelato together and actually watch the
races together from you know all around
the world in our living room in Italy
and we would discuss you know as soon as
grow up as father and son always you we
would discuss which was the best driver
which was the best team why some teams
would win and other would lose instead
and to a certain extent we were always
puzzled by 1/2 an aspect that sometimes
it is not the most innovative team or
the one with the best resources that was
winning and you know the usual answer
was yeah you know that&#39;s that&#39;s luck you
know they&#39;d be lucky and I was like hmm
yeah maybe they were lucky but I think
there is something behind then I cannot
really grasp and you know that one day
I&#39;m gonna give you an answer so that&#39;s
exactly what I&#39;ve been doing and you
know I grew up with the idea that you
know I&#39;m not I&#39;m working Formula one you
know I&#39;m gonna do everything right to
work in Formula one and actually you
know I started well good my good grades
good out of school and guess what as
soon as I got out of school the
financial crisis hit and it was very
hard to find any type of job in in Italy
especially in Formula one so I I sent my
tonal civvies and I never even got close
to get an interview so I started doing
other things had a very mediocre career
as a driver in Formula SAE I started up
my own
a university racing team and we ended up
winning in hockey and I&#39;m in 2009 and
ultimately you know I started working
with a gp2 team which is the feeder
category of Formula One and I said okay
you know what I&#39;m gonna try everything
here and we try to bring this team to
Formula one and if they make it I&#39;m
gonna be in Formula One otherwise I&#39;m
gonna do another thing is I always
wanted to do which is I&#39;m gonna start a
PhD in management so you know how this
story went the team didn&#39;t make it to
Formula One and I started my PhD
management and you know when starting my
PhD management I got you know very
interesting the topic of strategy and
when you talk about strategy this day
you talk about innovation innovation in
the firm&#39;s innovation in the
organization in the products in the
processes which we heard a lot of story
about innovations these are some of the
hard cells in innovation literature and
you know somehow when you read these
books there is a you know innovation is
kind of worshipped right and there&#39;s a
lot of talking about you know the world
is changing we have to innovate more we
have to change you know and it sounds a
little bit like the innovation is the
panacea of all issues all problems but I
was not quite sure because this would
not answer to my original question right
why sometimes innovating less leads to
superior performance and so I started
looking at several industries you know
on car industry cell phones video games
oil gas and ultimately I realized that a
very cool setting where I could actually
observe this was Formula one yes
so before me going on with the story of
Formula One
can I please ask you a question do you
all know what is Formula One if the can
you please raise your hand if you have
no clue what formula One is there
anybody here maybe from us now exact
weight a minute like you know in us
there&#39;s a great tradition of motorsport
we know that and but it&#39;s slightly
different right they have NASCAR they
have IndyCar so when I present my
studies in in the US I usually say well
you know Formula One the cars look a
little bit like IndyCar but actually in
Formula One
there are requires some tracking skills
okay because you know this is a Formula
one track is an IndyCar track you don&#39;t
simply go and look you actually have to
be good at driving but you know beside
that it&#39;s pretty similar I&#39;m joking of
course I&#39;m joking but you know some
colleagues of mine from from Harvard say
that actually racing might seem like a
you know very far from the world of
business but in fact it represents a
perfect laboratory for research
particularly for management and business
research why that well first of all we
have a clear measure of performance
right we know exactly how fast the cars
go we know exactly that every team is
trying to get ahead of the competitors
this is not the case for every industry
right there could be some firms that
prefer you know prioritizing financial
performance other prefer market share or
visibility instead here everybody wants
to get ahead of the competitors then we
have a very precise record of everything
that happens in the sport we know every
innovation we know that there are
regulations released by our Federation
that&#39;s called the FIA they get changed
every year and all teams must adapt and
at the end of the year all these secret
projects are not secret anymore and the
teams published their blueprints so you
can actually observe everything you know
in terms of every single bits of
innovation every part of the of the car
also we know who are the drivers we even
know what a drivers had for breakfast
sometimes because they talk in the media
and they tell everything about their
life we know where Louis salmon throws
be sleeping the night before well at
least we guess sometimes and and so it&#39;s
it&#39;s perfect laboratory for research now
when I started looking at you know at
this question you know what&#39;s less
innovative firms were outperforming one
case Stan stood out and the case that
the story gonna tell you about is
actually about these two gentlemen on
top you will see Nick fry
long-established executive in Formula
One he started his career with a very
famous aasta.martin nothing for me no
one then he moved also to Honda brawn GP
and when he retired a few years ago it
was the CEO of the winning car at the
moment Mercedes Formula One team at the
bottom we have one of the legends of the
sport Ross Brawn
currently is in charge of reshaping the
the industry and the rules of the game
is even at the lead of a technical lead
of Benetton and Ferrari eight world
championships eight in the driver&#39;s
championship eight constructors
championship is definitely one of the
the finest of the sport now what
happened is that in between 2006 and
2008 these two gentlemen were working
work for Fonda Formula One team now
Honda has been for a long time in
Formula One as a supplier in 2006 they
decided to enter the competition with a
full car so Honda car not just an engine
and they have higher two very talented
executives and they put one of the
biggest budgets in the field in the
competition around 300 millions budget
per year there was a lot of money still
today would be one of the highest
budgets but somehow in those years they
failed in delivering any sort of
significant result and in 2008 this was
getting a little embarrassing right so
and also it was a time of financial
turmoil so at a certain point that he
said that you know what enough we&#39;re
gonna pull out of Formula One
we&#39;re gonna shut down everything and
this was an issue because the the plan
that they had here UK would have left
unemployed around 300 people so they
call the two top executives the sporting
director and the technical director and
they said you know what you should find
a sub buyer but who would possibly buy a
team like this a team that had
everything lined up to succeed the best
resources a long experience and now they
also had a lot of depth so they couldn&#39;t
find anybody and they decided overnight
at beginning 2009 to to a management
buyout so basically they bought the team
for one Sterling pound of course with
all the depth and duties that that&#39;s
implied
they left unfortunately at home half of
the people after the employees they kept
the two drivers at the time now I hope
there&#39;s no Jenson Button of Rubens
Barrichello fans in the audience but I
must say at the time they were not some
of the finest Jenson Button had scored
in 2008 their 18th position and Rubens
Barrichello the 14th position so they
were not probably some of the best in
the racetrack and they built a car with
what they had a very basic no frills are
this was it very few sponsors as you can
see very few stickers so very little
support and they went and raised just
with a hope of staying in the race and
how did he go well on the left hand on
the left column the red one you will see
the constructor championship brawn GP
one second red bull that was not the red
bull that we know today it was a very
junior team at a time and only third
McLaren with only 71 points against 172
points of brawn GP on the right hand we
see the winner Jenson Button where you
want that year his only World
Championship with 95 points and Rubens
Barrichello did quite well with 77
points now the question is how was it
possible how was it possible that a team
with half resources same drivers same
executives did so well the answer lies
in this page in 2009 Formula One
underwent a major revolution a technical
revolution and one thing that was
introduced was the care so all the teams
at the beginning of the season were
asked to reshape completely the car so
the cars between 2008 and 2009 were very
different we&#39;re narrower the wings were
different the engine was different and
they could use the care square stands
for kinetic energy recovery system
basically it&#39;s a system that collects
waste heat from the brakes transforms it
into electricity stores in a battery and
get it available for additional boost
it&#39;s basically like a Toyota Prius
slightly more powerful okay now all the
major teams were very interested in
getting this technology running why well
first of all they wanted to show that
Formula One was a environmentally
friendly sports activity second they
wanted to develop the R&amp;D for this kind
of technology the later on would have
ended up in Road car and a lot of the
technology that today we have in road
cars comes from Formula One
but most of all they wanted you were to
meet overtaking their competitors so all
the major teams Ferrari McLaren at the
time B&amp;W was racing they decided to go
for this technology um mr. Braun said we
don&#39;t have the money we don&#39;t have the
time to develop these and plus we really
don&#39;t know how much power this
technology can give us there&#39;s a lot of
confusion we are really quite challenged
in you know coping with all the changes
in the regulation of this year why don&#39;t
we do a simple no frills perfecting the
type of knowledge and technology we
already know well for example
aerodynamics and what I did they
improved what they called a double
diffuser which is a technology that was
already in the car they just made it
larger and more effective to increase
the grip and the other teams who had the
cares had issues issues of fire shocks
to the mechanics and they barely
finished the race and it was even more
surprising as media pointed that was the
team without the cares they were doing
well in the championship
guess what are you a technical director
director of Red Bull also didn&#39;t used
the cares now my father would say ok
that was luck well I said let&#39;s go and
see if he was really luck so when my
friends and co-authors Alessandro Marino
Ries mesquita and Jane and we basically
transformed 30 years of Formula One
races into numbers we coded for around
two years every single bit of innovation
over more than 300 cars we call that all
the regulation all the drivers all the
performances of all cars and we made a
mega mathematical model and and we wrote
a paper on it and guess what we
discovered first of all the relation
between innovation and performance is
not linear meaning that it&#39;s not true
that the more innovation you have the
better performance you receive actually
its curvilinear meaning that after a
point the innovation returns flatten and
eventually become negative and there is
a sweet spot we are in stable
environments you are if you hit that
sweet spot that right specific amount of
innovation you will maximize your
performance but what is even more
interesting is that when environment
become more turbulent in our case when
the regulation change more and so the
teams are more challenged in innovating
the car the curve recedes and so does
the sweet spot meaning that we obtain
the optimum point for performance at the
lower level of innovation so what&#39;s the
takeaway of this well when complexity
Rises less is more and you should not be
afraid of thinking that you&#39;re not
capable of doing more I mean look around
you especially in time of crisis there
are so many companies who managed to
disrupt the market just by delivering
products that work well they are simple
no frills and they cater a specific
service and this is very true especially
in settings in environments where for
example there is a competitor there is a
much more advanced technology and this
is being true for a long time since the
times of the 40 so remember there are no
such thing as good or bad ideas there
are ideas that either fit or don&#39;t fit
the environment before committing to
make your decision before making major
lips always try to understand what your
environment is doing how it&#39;s changing
there are three things you should look
at one the magnitude of change how big
is the change
how does state one differ from state two
when you observe it second the frequency
of change how often the real change
happen every week every month every year
every ten years and are they big or
small because you could have very
frequent changes but maybe they are
small enough to be easy to adapt and
finally how likely it is that you are
able to predict how the change is going
to be the future states because most
changes even the most radical one
sometimes can be interpreted and one can
adapt very well if is able to predict so
try to predict your
environment and if it&#39;s unpredictable
note that down reduce complexity during
turbulence and wait for a stable moment
to accelerate but don&#39;t give up your
ideas if you have to hold back don&#39;t
forget them
don&#39;t put them away they might be
perfect at a different point in time
think about this
February 5th 1996 Business Week was
celebrating the fall of an American icon
Apple exactly ten years in one day after
Steve Jobs Magic Kingdom same same
newspaper and it took us ten years to
understand that computers were not just
very functional machines but also
beautiful machines objects of design
that tell us something about who we are
and what we want to be and talking about
what we want to be what about childhood
dreams when is the time to really push
the envelope on your dreams on your
ideas well I don&#39;t have an answer to
that I can only tell you my experience
after few years of publishing my studies
and luckily getting some media exposure
and some awards some teams call me up
and say hey pal why don&#39;t you come to
the pits to give us some help so
eventually I ended up doing the job of
my my dreams it&#39;s just it was not the
conventional way because when I was
ready for it the environment was not
ready for me and so to leave you with a
sentence from the great driver
Mario Andretti if things seems under
control you&#39;re not just going fast
enough and when things are under control
that&#39;s the time to accelerate
