it&#39;s been an interesting kind of year
actually and we&#39;ve had astronomical
events this year and we we had a total
solar eclipse not long ago an event of
that kind isn&#39;t going to happen for a
number of years yet to come back in
January we we also had what we might
class as being an astronomical event in
the presidential inauguration of well
one of the more interesting presidents
in in recent US history but there was
one key event of 2017 which actually may
overshadow all of these and this was the
blessing which was brought to us in the
form of the emoji movie yes the emoji
movie what a time to be alive
and so this is a film that&#39;s dedicated
solely to emoji these little symbols
that we use in online communication in
text messages or on social media and
what we typically consider emojis to be
is a form of emotional communication
trying to help other people interpret
our emotional states or to try and
establish emotional tone within
communication but what&#39;s becoming
increasingly evident is that emoji is
actually revealing more about us than we
perhaps realize and it&#39;s not just about
communicating emotion but in some
respects what emoji is actually
communicating is aspects of our
personality so what we can do then is
ask the question to what extent can we
look at different types of emoji
behavior in another person and try and
establish something about their
personality what it might reveal about
their different aspects of personality
now a good way to try and a study this
is under the perspective that
personality is multi-dimensional we have
different aspects of what comprises
human personality and one of the key
theories that we use within personality
psychology is known as the Big Five
model and what this suggests is that
there are five key traits or dimensions
which form human personality and these
are extraversion agreeableness
conscientiousness neuroticism and
openness to experience so what we&#39;re
interested in then in this kind of
research is trained to establish the
extent to which these different facets
of personality might be related to
different types of emoji behavior can we
find any correspondence there so this is
the exact same question we&#39;ve been
asking at our lab at Edge Hill
University and what we&#39;ve been doing
essentially is recruiting Facebook users
primarily and what we asked our Facebook
users to do is to come into our lab and
the first thing we do is ask them to
complete a personality questionnaire so
this is in a form of a self-report so we
just asked them to respond to a number
of different questions which correspond
to each of those five traits and what we
can get from this then is a numerical
score associated with each of the five
so we have five trait scores what we
then want to do is to see does this
actually relate in any way to emoji
behavior and now we can get this
information in a number of different
ways
one method we use very commonly in
psychology is a self-report so what we
do here is again ask people about their
behavior they&#39;re just reporting on their
general use of emoji so we may ask
questions such as do you use emoji if
you use them then what kind do you use
how often do you use them so this is all
well and good but what the problem with
this is is that people just generally
aren&#39;t very accurate are being able to
gauge their behavior they tend to either
over or sometimes underestimate so it
can be a little bit limiting so what
we&#39;ve done for this research as well is
to take a more objective measure of
emoji behavior and what we do for this
is basically look at people&#39;s Facebook
profiles and now we can do this
ethically we don&#39;t go snooping around
people&#39;s facebook profiles and spy on
them for any time what we ask our
participants to do with their explicit
written consent is to access their
profile so they log on while they&#39;re in
the lab and what we then do with their
permission is take screenshots of their
Facebook profile page so what we can get
from this then is evidence of their
emoji behavior we can look at how many
of they&#39;ve used whether they&#39;ve used any
at all in fact and if they have used
them then which kind of they used and
how many have they used so we have a
nice objective behavioral measure that
we can use to then see do these
different traits correspond with with
the way in which people are using emoji
so what we find on this is that we
develop a number of different categories
of emoji behavior so within this
particular research we had this standard
smiley emoji the standard sort of sad
ones but then we also had a third
category which was a kind of
miscellaneous category so ones like
sarcasm for example that that don&#39;t
really neatly fit into the other two
main categories and what we found when
we corresponded the different
personality traits to the different
categories of behavior we found that the
trait of openness to experience was
quite important
now openness refers essentially to
somebody&#39;s level of open-mindedness so
if you&#39;re the kind of person who scores
high in openness to experience then you
tend to be the kind of person who
derives a lot of enjoyment from new
experiences meeting new people that kind
of thing and we found actually that this
trait the people who are higher in this
open-mindedness traits
tended to use this kind of more diverse
range of emoji so not the standard ones
that the ones like the sarcasm and
things like that so this maybe give us
some kind of insight into what emoji you
might reveal about people&#39;s level of
open-mindedness which was quite
interesting however what we were
actually really interested in is the
extent to which another person who might
not know this emoji user what they might
understand about a person through their
emoji usage so we want to understand it
within an interaction or within a
communication because that&#39;s where
that&#39;s when we use them right so what we
then did was we recruited a second group
of participants so we&#39;d built on study
one the people who came in and we got
their Facebook profiles what we&#39;ve ended
in study two was recruit a second group
of participants who recall our observers
and we what we asked our observers to do
was to look through each
the profiles from the screenshots which
would previously obtained and to make a
personality impression of the study one
participants and so what we could do
then was to look the extent to which the
different traits perceptions might be
related to the emoji coding of that
behavior we&#39;d previously established
okay so what did we find and well smiley
emoji seemed to be quite important
actually so what we found is that the
more smiley emoji the study won
participants had used on their Facebook
page the more the observers rated them
to be high in three particular traits
one of those traits was agreeableness
now agreeableness essentially refers to
how cooperative or considerate you are
to other people
we also found conscientiousness and so
this is a trait associated with getting
things done on time being timely
punctual that kind of thing
and finally this openness traits against
this open-mindedness so simply using
smiley emoji seem to be those were the
perceptions that other people had people
who&#39;d never met these people before they
were making a first impression about
their personality now going a step
further what we really really really
want to know is are these actually
accurate personality perceptions so what
we then did to answer this question was
to correspond the observers traits
perception scores the impression scores
with the original participants own
self-report of their own personality so
essentially what we were doing was a
similarity for each of the earth of five
traits so the more similar those scores
were the more the observers had made an
accurate personality impression when we
actually looked then at the similarities
what we found was that the observers
were accurate at being able to determine
two particular traits one of those
traits was extraversion and the second
of those traits was openness and so what
we are assuming within this is that the
emoji behavior the smiley emoji was one
of the behaviors that actually helped
them make this judgment accurately now I
just want to put this in a broader
context M just for a moment and
so we know a lot about how we form first
impressions and why their importance but
a lot of what we know about this is from
what we understand about real world so
face to face first impression making and
we know from this research that
extraversion is a traits that were
generally very good at being able to to
establish in somebody the first time
we&#39;ve met them regardless of whether
this is in a real world context or or
whether it&#39;s online and the main reason
for that is that there are a lot of
visible behaviors that help us just
detect that in other people quite easily
so this isn&#39;t necessarily a new finding
what is interesting though is that the
trait of openness this open-mindedness
traits isn&#39;t something in a face-to-face
first impression that we&#39;re generally
very good at being able to establish
probably because they&#39;re not many
visible behaviors when you&#39;re meeting
somebody for the first time in if in a
real world context that helped you
understand that however what we&#39;re
finding so what this study and another
another corresponding studies are
finding is that in an online first
impression openness is something that
we&#39;re actually quite good at being able
to detect so I think there&#39;s some
interesting implications here that are
worth discussing we tend to think of the
online communication as being a little
bit like the poor relative of human
communication and in most cases actual
real world interaction it does tend to
be better it&#39;s often much richer we have
a lot more behaviors we can be drawing
on to help understand one another but I
think we should be very cautious about
making this assumption in relation to
all kind of behaviors and so what this
is starting to suggest then is that
there may be specific behaviors which
occur exclusively online emoji behavior
may be being one of a number of these
which actually are helping us understand
each other better down a real world
context can afford us so I think this is
really important to take on and the kind
of potential for emoji might not be it&#39;s
not and they&#39;re not just about
expressing emotion or expressing
personality even but emoji themselves
may be providing as much more
information than we perhaps even aware
of
so they&#39;re maybe going some way to help
us understand each other&#39;s real-world
behaviors whether that&#39;s previous
behavior that&#39;s happened or or indeed
subsequent behaviors so I&#39;ve got a quick
very quick example and to kind of
highlight this so what I&#39;m going to
present is a hypothetical online
interaction between two people and and
just sort of interpret what&#39;s going on
so it&#39;s just a what&#39;s up and interaction
they&#39;re describing a previous behavior
something that happened last night you
kind of know where this is going don&#39;t
you and what they&#39;re now going to do is
present the exact same interaction but
this time present one single emoji
within this and I want just to consider
to what extent we may be interpreting
the previous behavior possibly slightly
differently yes if you&#39;ve no idea what
I&#39;m talking about here I&#39;m more or less
referring to the Netflix and chill thing
and if you still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m
talking about please just do an internet
search on that later so what the emoji
is doing here
is providing additional contextual
information that we perhaps don&#39;t have
to the same extent and in the previous
example of that interaction so in this
case what I see the potential of emoji
to do and for research to establish more
more clearly is to what extent emoji may
be in allowing this interpretation but
importantly how they may be helping us
accurately interpret particularly
intended subsequent behavior because
that could be really key in a way of
helping us understand each other to an
even better extent but regardless of
what&#39;s and the emoji research is going
to be looking like in the next you know
5 or even 10 years and I think that we
can come to one very solid conclusion
that&#39;s we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got an awful lot of
new material that&#39;s going to be arriving
in our understanding of emoji and
certainly that&#39;s going to give us a very
strong basis for what inevitably is most
likely to end up being the emoji movie
the sequel thank you very much
