I appreciate this is gonna sound a
little bit random but I want to tell you
all today about the time that I met Sir
Trevor McDonald it was my sister&#39;s
graduation he was getting some kind of
honorary degree and he gave a speech I
was sat right at the back of the room
and so all I could really see between
everyone&#39;s heads was that he was wearing
at the front this really awful garish
multicolored graduation robe afterwards
I got a chance to meet him in person and
to see his hideous Technicolor Dreamcoat
writer close it was several years after
this meeting that I first found out
completely by accident that none of it
ever actually happened
turns out Trevor McDonald hadn&#39;t been at
my sister&#39;s graduation so there was no
speech and there was no Technicolor
Dreamcoat but once I was forced for a
second to doubt my own memory I realized
the bigger problem with it
I wasn&#39;t at my sister&#39;s graduation
either
are these kind of mistakes they really
shouldn&#39;t happen to me so I&#39;m a lecturer
I&#39;m a researcher who studies false
memories I study how and why people come
to remember things differently from how
they really happened or things that
never happened at all so you&#39;d think
then that I would know the signs that
I&#39;m remembering something untrue
apparently not let me take you back or
back a few steps though because many of
you might think of remembering as being
something a bit like a library where you
can go into the archives and you pull a
memory down from the shelf and each time
you open it up you can see the same
words and pictures each time but it
isn&#39;t like that remembering if anything
is more like telling stories where yes
we might miss certain details out each
time but we might also
confuse or change or simplify details
for ourselves but importantly we might
also invent details and it&#39;s difficult
for us to think of remembering as being
like telling stories to ourselves in
part because it doesn&#39;t tally with our
everyday experience of feeling like our
memories map perfectly onto reality but
it&#39;s also difficult for us to know when
our memories don&#39;t map onto reality
because memories to an extent are our
reality and our values our beliefs our
preferences our identity are all shaped
up in what we remember so why would we
want to doubt any of that even for a
second maybe it would reassure you then
if I told you that scientists now know
over way of telling for sure
whether any particular memory is true or
whether it&#39;s false I could tell you that
today but I would be lying to you in
fact still even despite decades of
excellent research on this topic we
still only really have rules of thumb
ways of making educated guesses we don&#39;t
have any cast-iron guarantees and so
what that means in most cases the only
way we can really know for sure
if a particular memory is true or false
is if we can prove it if we can go and
find strong independent corroborating
evidence that proves or disproves
confirms what this current confirms the
way we&#39;re remembering most cases we
couldn&#39;t really even reasonably expect
that kind of evidence to exist and our
research shows that even when that
evidence might exist people tend to be
pretty reluctant to go out and put time
and effort into trying to find it
perhaps because we just trust our memory
so much it doesn&#39;t seem worth the hassle
going around trying to prove or disprove
our memories all the time but what
mytravel McDonald memory illustrates
quite well is that people do sometimes
find out that their memories are untrue
often by accident
take my dad for instance who while
tracing his family tree found out that
his grandfather who remembers spending
time with as a kid actually died before
my dad was born or take the novelist Ian
McEwan who recently described having
ransacked this house looking for a
perfect forty thousand word manuscripts
that he eventually conceded he must have
never actually written in recent years
we spent some time studying what happens
to people&#39;s memories after they stopped
believing in them and by and large the
answer seems to be not very much happens
our memories can stay persistently vivid
and rich persistently compelling long
after we&#39;ve stopped treating them as
real memories how many of your memories
might turn out the same way if you were
to afford them a moment of doubt well
this problem gets a bit bigger when we
accept that sometimes even when there is
evidence that fits with our memories it
doesn&#39;t always guarantee that they&#39;re
true let me give you an example a few
years ago we conducted a series of
studies in which we filmed participants
as they observed and copied various
different actions a couple of days later
we got them back in the lab and we
showed them some clips from these videos
what we didn&#39;t tell them was that we&#39;d
added in some extra clips some fake
clips that we created using digital
video editing software and these extra
clips seemed to prove that they
performed extra actions that they
haven&#39;t really done we found that up to
half of the time people later told us
that they could clearly and vividly
remember performing those actions that
we&#39;d face into the video it seems that
when we&#39;re faced with misleading
evidence even about our own recent
behavior we can respond to that by
creating quite rapidly memories that fit
with that evidence and that corroborate
that misleading evidence and in fact we
don&#39;t even need to be misled sometimes
even the truth can create false memories
and one study pairs of participants
watch a visit watched a video together
that had been filmed from two different
perspectives witness one from their
perspective sees at one point that a
wall
and steals a wallet from a desk witness
to seize nothing at that point their
view is obscured by a wall the pair&#39;s
are later us to discuss what they&#39;ve
seen
Inez and then separately tested on what
they remember the researchers here found
that of those people who hadn&#39;t seen the
theft 60% nevertheless said they&#39;d seen
the girls steal a wallet these people
haven&#39;t been mislead their partners
quite accurately have told them what
they saw but it&#39;s they who&#39;ve made the
mistake of thinking assuming that if you
remember a theft and if I can kind of
picture that theft in my mind then the
picture in my mind must then be a memory
so just because someone remembers the
same as you doesn&#39;t necessarily mean
that you&#39;ve got a true memory in fact
it&#39;s plausible that even if tens or
hundreds or thousands of people remember
the same as you you might still have a
false memory in 2013 when Nelson Mandela
passed away a lot of people were
confused because they thought they
remembered him having died years before
and when these people went to the
internet they found hundreds of other
people who seemed to share the same
false memory some even said they
remembered his funeral back in the 80s
in other instances of this kind of
effect we see people collectively
remembering the same dodgy nineties
movie that was never actually made or
remembering that back in the day on maps
they used to put New Zealand on the west
of Australia not on the East our false
memories like these and many others
they&#39;re probably quite inconsequential
if they don&#39;t have huge impacts on our
lives and so one reason why we don&#39;t
often find out about them but false
memories can be consequential and the
consequences can be important we might
for example fail to take our vital
medication because we falsely remember
already taking it we might argue with
our partner over conflicted conflicting
memories of who
was that invited around that unwelcome
guest for dinner
we might vote a particular way based on
a rosy nostalgia that misrepresents how
much better things really used to be in
the past well we might take away an
innocent person&#39;s Liberty because of
witnesses memory mistakenly places them
at the scene of a crime in practice
despite all of the research that I in
colleagues have done showing the ways in
which memories can be unreliable and
despite my own personal experiences of
knowing that I&#39;ve remembered things
confidently that for sure never happened
I never less I don&#39;t go around
constantly doubting that I can put faith
in the things that I do remember and nor
should you because to do that all the
time would be debilitating but in this
supposedly fake news post truth world
where we&#39;re all increasingly being told
to be suspicious of who might be lying
to us at any one time we should all
remember that our memories lie to us too
and so when our reality comes into
question we should all be prepared at
least a little bit to leave some room
for doubt thank you
