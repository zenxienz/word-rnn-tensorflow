I don&#39;t really get nervous but I am
actually vibrating right now this is
genuinely a dream come true from me I
haven&#39;t been able to find the tweet but
I know about two years ago I got a tweet
eggs and that I would love to do a TED
talk I didn&#39;t think that I would ever be
standing here tonight and I suppose
tonight I want to share a story with you
about a journey of my own self awareness
so picture this it&#39;s Saturday morning
and I&#39;m in the kitchen with my two
little girls and as per usual I&#39;m J
Panda baked and attemptmove pancakes and
pretend to be a master chef and my two
little munchkin throughout the T above
scribbling and coloring in and we like
to call this Saturday morning article so
a certain as the pancakes
obviously layered in cereth are sculpt
we wipe the sticky fingers and it&#39;s time
for the big art reveal a my youngest ill
ish produces this really cute this is me
taking our gorgeous grizzly 4ad under
and unfortunately we lost Gracie three
years ago to cancer and as we reminisce
to fight what a beautiful dog she was
and the great crack that we had with her
I started to look at the picture nice
and Irish this is a little poop I got my
hand and she left at the interment boy
it&#39;s your phone and I thought right of
course it&#39;s my phone so later that same
night we were having our assembly night
games like I felt like a real Mary
Poppins I&#39;m not really it just so
happens that this is what we were doing
and family night games and I
to take the tip of one two three the
floor is lava have you ever played it
really good fun funny fashions cards are
good old told me insurance so Sharia
takes the form of me getting a piece of
paper ripping it up and writing time
random things like pretend to be a
hairdresser pretend to make pizza
pretend to be a cat so it was the
Alicia&#39;s goal and she picked the little
piece of paper and she looked at it
nodded her head confidently saladin and
did a thing like this and in two seconds
a fillet being male and I went right
okay though folks I stand here before
you and say that my name is Nev Michael
Hoffman and I am an addict it all
started as social and frequent usage but
9 for the last three years I have been a
full-blown addict I am addicted to my
smartphone and the social media like
someone checking me and the gut I
thought is this really her my kids
perceive me Here I am
am I crazy as a single moment to mold
these girls into socially confident
conversationally literate young girls
and they think I am this moral with my
head buried on the screen my mom once
said to me in fact more than once did
she come to have coffee with me
or look at that bloody phone and another
friend actually said you do realize you
know you&#39;re the only person that I get
an instant reply on wax up from though I
started to think and believe me what
you&#39;re about to hear is an absolute
contradiction to everything that I do
was in the realms of my working life I
bring people and businesses together
through digital technology and social
media I have been really fortunate
enough to travel the globe to deliver
training to teach people how to do this
and I started to wonder at what point
that these devices creep into our lives
to become an extension of our right arm
am I the only Alec is there research out
there that proves that there is in fact
an addiction mm-hmm and guess what yes
there is a lot of evidence so much so
they&#39;re claiming social media as the
crack cocaine of the digital age
aside from society having the highest
levels of social anxiety social
awkwardness eating disorders and
depression I decided to take my research
a little further and I delved a little
deeper and I find even more shocking
stories this is an avatar child from the
online game Prius a couple in Seoul got
so addicted to this game that their own
little baby daughter died of starvation
and neglect this is a true story they
got so engrossed in this game that they
were spending up to 12 hours a day in a
cyber cafe that their own gorgeous
daughter died of a consequence and we
all gasp and think how could this not
real but it is real but a five minutes
from now we move on and get on with our
life when did this become socially
acceptable so as luck would have it ah
in my journey of awareness there was a
stormy night and whatever happened the
area light side it disconnected from the
TV and it wasn&#39;t picking up the channels
and because I&#39;m obviously so addicted to
my phone I don&#39;t watch TV so I didn&#39;t
fix it
and I also canceled my broadband
contract at home as well because I have
a little wireless dongle that I use and
I have 20 gig of my phone though I
couldn&#39;t justify the spend but here&#39;s
seeing me as something my care instead
income lickin the TV in the tap in the
living room they didn&#39;t come crying to
him can we get on the iPad it was none
of that they went outside and they
played with their frames and when the
weather was crap they came inside and
they played
toys and we built our little bridge in
the heist was not having broadband
connection because we didn&#39;t miss it nor
did we need it but here&#39;s the thing they
get their YouTube and seven super Garen
sticks when they go to their daddies so
what&#39;s all right so this is a beautiful
place
in Portugal and we went on holidays
there this year and I&#39;d ordered
obviously a transfer from the airport to
the villa and of course maybe and Mimas
for organized OCD onto the foam tap in
the address and to see how long it was
gonna take to get the Bella I&#39;m on
holiday Aoife Lily taps mean she says
mommy what&#39;s that over there
now I&#39;m so busy typing in the address
nice to say what&#39;s that there&#39;s the Sun
I&#39;m in the stunning Algarve and I am
sitting like a clunker tucking in the
address to see how long it&#39;s going to
take so I pulled in for Lillian he ran a
mission here and we looked out the
window and we talked about all the
beautiful scenery that we could see and
we talked about the cracks that we were
going to have in the water parks and in
the pool and all of that there were
quick tech folks look up and look out
because the journey is going to take as
long as it&#39;s going to take so you know
when somebody quits the cigarettes and
they kind of become like the Antichrist
of smoking well I kind of became like
this on my days of my digital detox and
I was standing in a supermarket ready to
check out with my groceries and this
young Gary leaded by 14 stood there like
this
and me and my newly aware state I tapped
from the oh nice excuse me Pat I said we
couldn&#39;t just move out over there and
that meepo groceries three-nation her
that&#39;s a response and sulked over to the
wall and i left and her mother was at
the other end of the checkout in a cold
sweat
packing the bags in the groceries for
her beloved family and I wanted to say
could help your mommy but no I didn&#39;t
but I did continue to watch her nothing
totally alien unaware of any human
interaction no movement but the flicker
of an eye and then this shoulders back
my phone went up the head tilted this is
mine the selfie right this big smile
Jesus you weren&#39;t like that too exact
it&#39;s ago the phone Kim died the smile
disappeared
another perfect example of the
superficial image that she was
portraying for her friends on snapchat
or whatever channel she wanted to send
that on so when I was out for lunch then
a few weeks ago with the team we sat
around the table and the four of us were
all on our phones and I said guys bones
in the middle of the table night and we
did I said the first person that lifts
her phone lifts the Bell did anybody
left the film no because they&#39;re all so
miserable
did anybody did anybody die no nothing
happened but what do we do with a great
catch up a good laugh even if it was
only for 45 minutes it was great so why
are we doing this to ourselves we need
to become more aware and just when we
talk about human interaction even dating
has gone to pot if you&#39;re looking to
find your new partner and crime it&#39;s all
tinder bumble matcom plentyoffish
TED talk I could give you a bell Bob
Sam Nick and Tom talk right I&#39;ve heard
all of their gripes and groans I&#39;ve
heard all of their amusing accolades and
achievements I&#39;ve heard about every
dating disaster every cycle and every
lunatic they&#39;ve ever gone I twist but
guess what they keep coming back for
more of the same
boring conversation where are you from
yours
is it nice weather for your apt what do
you work at I&#39;ve got so bored trying to
tell people what it is that I do I lie
night and I say I&#39;m a cardiologist and
it seems to go down really really well
have you been single for long what are
you looking for yourself on here and I&#39;m
like well you know Einstein there&#39;s no
flies on you uh-huh and then another
clinker is high tall are you
I think I&#39;m what does that actually
matter because in a matter of moments
this conversation is gonna end we&#39;re
never gonna meet and aside from your
photographs being ten years old and in
reality you&#39;re five stone heavier we
still continue with this monotonous
script I got so bored with these
conversations I decided it was my duty
to help these guys so I offered them
some advice on how to talk to women they
have totally lost the art of chivalry so
I thought it was my duty to teach how to
talk to women are we going to lose the
capability of delivering real-life
relationships to virtual relationships
is this going to become the norm because
in fact I&#39;ll tell you something
Japan is already predicting a third and
the drop of its population by 2016
because young Japanese men do not have
nor do they want real-life relationships
very happy playing in their little rooms
with their little games virtually
connected yet socially disconnected
I have very lucky I&#39;ve 50,000 followers
on Facebook and half a million followers
on Instagram like I don&#39;t really but it
signs good
aha all had you there but that&#39;s the
thing pictures because of you&#39;re stuck
in Cork it&#39;s five o&#39;clock in the morning
and you need somebody to come and rescue
you who&#39;s gonna be that person I have
five five real friends that will come
and get me
so tonight I want you to be aware to
keep it real and when I go for coffee
with my mom and I I leave my phone in
the car when I go for dinner I leave my
phone in the car and the next time it&#39;s
Friday night and you want to chill out
but your baby girl is saying mommy look
at my handstand look at my handstand and
it looks more like a little baby piglet
trying to jump put the phone down and
tell her
that&#39;s brilliant you&#39;re brilliant you&#39;re
getting there and I thank you
[Applause]
you
[Applause]
