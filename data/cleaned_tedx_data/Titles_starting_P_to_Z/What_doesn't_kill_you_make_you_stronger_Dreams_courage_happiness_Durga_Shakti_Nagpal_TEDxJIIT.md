thank you all for being present here my
topic for today is slightly long what
doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger
dreams courage and happiness let me
start with what all of us have in common
here we all are dreamers all of us love
to dream we dream while we are sleeping
we dream while we&#39;re awake and at times
we also dream in class like some of you
may be dreaming right now
dreams dreams can be big they can be
small they can be concrete and at times
they are quite abstract but dreams are
what make us and shape us we are a
product of our dreams no dreams means no
goals and no goals means an aimless life
when I was in college I was a reasonably
serious student at least that is how I
heard liked or do you remember myself I
would often dream what would I do after
my BTech like most BTech students the
option of having a big pay package with
a big company sounded pretty exciting
and on some mornings parental advice try
preparing for the civil services stood
before me so when I was in my final year
of college I mounted on two horses just
like I said they&#39;ve been does in the
movie son of Sardar how many of you feel
that movie it&#39;s a very interesting stunt
that he does so I mounted on two horses
and I started preparing for my Civil
Services exam along with my engineering
exams but you see I was not so adept
like I said they&#39;ve done
and writing to horses at the same time
so I fell from one and I couldn&#39;t clear
my civils but thankfully I managed to
write the other horse and I cleared my
BTech it didn&#39;t take me too long to
stand up and start again for the second
attempt of my civil services
I believe setbacks earlier in life are
always easier to deal with
there&#39;s a saying hum kabhi heartening
Amiata GT a young Sikh pair it broadly
translates into we never lose we either
win or we learn I never forget what my
father once said when I asked him Papa
what should be my plan B he immediately
said beta if you&#39;re really focused you
don&#39;t need a plan B and I thought wow
how true I mean doesn&#39;t it all depend on
me and my efforts no external factors
really have a role to play
as I grew I became a firm believer in
what Palo Colo famously said in his book
The Alchemist when you aspire for
something the entire universe conspires
in helping you achieve it but what is it
exactly that makes you live your dreams
I suppose it is courage courage courage
means to chase your dreams fearlessly
and to find happiness in fulfilling them
courage is also the ability to
discipline and train your mind when I&#39;ve
had only a few years in the service now
but I&#39;ve been very fortunate to have
seen so many ups and downs that have
taught me so much I have also been
exceptionally blessed to have been
showered upon with infinite
press and love of numerous people and
organizations people said destiny gave
me a chance to personify my name some
even compared me to Goddess Durga
I felt really humbled and honored it was
my first such encounter with this
business business of illegally digging
of sand popularly called as the sand
mafia I had heard of diamond mafia
liquor mafia coal mafia real estate
mafia and even extortion mafia but sand
mafia was completely new to me sand sand
is something that blows with the wind
here and there and sometimes even into
our eyes with blinding effect it doesn&#39;t
have any romantic or or inspiring image
but we all know sand is one of the major
pillars of modern day development the
entire infrastructure that we see
changing the country&#39;s landscape be it
flyovers expressways shopping malls
skyscrapers wouldn&#39;t even dare to stand
without this dusty sand being a national
resource it is the sacrosanct duty of
the state to ensure that it is utilized
in the larger interest of the society
and at the same time to prevent its
illegal and indiscriminate exploitation
we as citizens do need to be
environmentally responsible because as
they say this earth doesn&#39;t need us we
need the earth so if we and our
generations are going to have a future
it needs to be a green one we need to
have an ecosystem that would harmonize
all forms of life and nature
this ecosystem reminds me of an incident
that happened during my training days at
Missouri futre kind I&#39;m sure some of you
here would be hailing from that
beautiful state autre kind is known for
its lush green hills and lovely weather
it reigns quite often and the hills get
very slippery with so much of vegetation
around thorns shrubs trekking becomes
quite a task in Missouri we were taken
for treks every weekend and this was my
first such trick as I was enjoying and
exploring the lovely nature around me I
happen to see something creep into my
canvas shoe before I could realize the
creature had completely disappeared
inside my shoe I quickly took off my
shoe and I was frightened to see it was
a leech stuck on to my foot I panicked
and I jumped I jumped so much that I
literally landed onto the lap of a batch
mate
hello guys please don&#39;t get any ideas
here my batch mate she was very calm and
I never forget what she said she said
hey dude just chill it&#39;s a part of the
ecosystem of which you are also a part
when her statement didn&#39;t really
convince me at that point in time but
she surely managed to pacify me so now
it was my fourth or fifth Trek and I was
busy climbing up the hill that another
batch mate of mine shouted at me hey you
have a leech on your leg I turned back
had a look and I said it&#39;s okay dude
it&#39;s a part of the ecosystem this
episode also taught me that if we learn
to live with our fears we eventually
conquer them couple of life lessons that
I have learned during my very brief
years of service I would like to share
with all of you the first one is you
live only once there&#39;s a really famous
very old movie of James Bond called you
live only twice I somehow don&#39;t agree
with that title
I feel each one of us has just one life
and that one life offers enough fire and
courage to change things for the better
how many of you have seen the movie
jungle Wow I think almost everybody and
how many of you have seen it twice Wow
I&#39;ve seen it twice too we all know
dongle is based on the real-life story
of wrestler Mahavir Singh forget Maha
veer Singh in spite of being a very good
wrestler unfortunately couldn&#39;t win a
gold medal for the nation he&#39;s very sad
more so because he doesn&#39;t have a son
who can fulfill his dream then one day
his neighbors complained to him that his
daughters have bitten their son&#39;s black
and blue and mommy Singh sees a golden
opportunity the rest is history
this nation has some of the best woman
wrestlers today what I&#39;m trying to say
is that if we all get one life time
which I hope you all believe in then why
not live it to the brim to the utmost
potential so live as if you will live
forever and dream as if you will dream
forever the next lesson that I learned
is compete with only yourself when I
started preparing for the Civil Services
exam I learned lakhs of students appear
for this exam for a few handful of seeds
the ratio for selection of the IAS is
almost one is to a thousand now that
meant that I would have to be better
than the 999 candidates in the thousand
lot that I would be a part of that&#39;s the
bad part of mathematics when you lined
up in such kind of
Galatians I was very worried I thought
how would I ever get through then I met
someone who said to me why you worried
about the 999 candidates
you only need one seat and for that one
seat
you only need to compete with yourself
when we decide to do something when we
decide to do something it&#39;s our decision
we need to own that decision and see it
through the last and probably the most
interesting lesson that I learned give
it your heart and soul and do not give
up Midway once the goal is decided we
need to give it our hundred percent
commitment and resoluteness it is very
natural that we will face difficulties
and troubles in our way but it&#39;s very
important to hold on to your strengths
more so your mental strength by giving
up Midway we undo the entire emotion and
effort that we have put behind that task
I&#39;m reminded of a very interesting video
that I saw on YouTube couple of days ago
it was an admiral of US Navy who talks
about the difficult training sessions
that the Navy cadets have to undergo in
order to complete the tough probation
period one such task involves swimming
in the sea in presence of sharks he goes
on to say that if a shark begins to
circle your position do not swim away
hold on to your ground
do not act afraid if the shark
darts towards you muster all your
courage and punch it at the snout it
will turn and swim away life is going to
be full of
if you hope to swim you will have to
learn to deal with them so do not give
up Midway and this will ultimately pave
the way for happiness and bliss
happiness happiness means to have faith
in your dreams it means to have
confidence in your efforts and it means
to have belief in yourself happiness
means dreaming fearlessly and
courageously living your dreams if
you&#39;re happy you will make your family
happy you&#39;ll make your friends happy
you&#39;ll make the people around you happy
and you&#39;ll make this world happy before
I conclude by citing the famous Hindi
poet
Dushyant Kumar let me explain the
English version of it the emphasis is on
making constant effort to improve things
wherever we are and now in the words of
the Scheldt Kumar Cerf Hungama Hara
karna Miramax add nahi sorry koshish hey
keya surah Vidal Nietzsche Hail Marys in
Amen he - teresina Missa he hookah him
he are licking our journey Tahir
