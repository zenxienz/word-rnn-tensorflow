have you ever found yourself pulling
into the parking lot of your job and
sitting in the car because the last
thing that you want to do was walk
inside you might get there 10 minutes
early and be like you know what I&#39;m
gonna stay here too like a 57 because
I&#39;m not gonna be in there for a minute
longer than I have to I have plenty of
jobs like that in my 20s as I went
through all of my schooling it was 10
years of college and medical school and
I had all kind of jobs and pretty much
all of them I had that sentiment at some
point and what got me through it was
knowing that when I&#39;m getting my real
job as a real plastic surgeon I won&#39;t
feel this way I felt like I was just
kind of paying my dues and going through
the motions that I had to go through to
get to my goal of becoming a plastic
surgeon so fast-forward 16 years of
school and training and I finally got my
first real job as a plastic surgeon and
for the first six or seven months it was
awesome
you know I was making all his money I
had my own patients I could do these
great operations on people I&#39;m like wow
I can&#39;t believe people are trusting me
to do this stuff on them you know it was
awesome right and then after about it
was about seven or eight months in as my
schedule got busier because I had been
there for a while and word-of-mouth
started spreading and I had more
patience I found myself pulling into the
parking lot of my office and not wanting
to get out the car and I&#39;m like this
wasn&#39;t supposed to happen when I became
a real plastic surgeon and it started to
happen more and more as I got busier and
busier what I noticed was that the days
that I had a full schedule that was
jam-packed with patients those were the
days I didn&#39;t want to get out the car
and the days that it was light and I
only had a few people to see and I had
time to talk to them and bond with them
those were the days that I liked but the
problem with that was on those days
where I got to talking behind and it
wasn&#39;t a lot of people we didn&#39;t make a
lot of money and I liked the money right
but then on the days when it was really
busy and they were rushing me in and out
of the room they&#39;re like Miley you got
to get out of here cuz I&#39;m a talker I&#39;ve
always been a talker I&#39;ve been getting
in trouble for talking since I was
little so here I am in these rooms with
these ladies they were awesome people
I&#39;m like you know if they would have
something going on that I felt like I
could help with I wanted to do that but
that there was nothing in the business
plan set aside for me to do that kind of
stuff they&#39;re like get in and get out
it&#39;s another person
all they wanted me to do was go in there
give him my surgical diagnosis come up
with a surgical plan and get out so I
can get to the next room so that I can
have a bunch of surgeries on the
schedule so I can make a lot of money
and that I did not like I like doing
surgeries I like making money but I
didn&#39;t like being rushed in and out I
didn&#39;t like rushing the encounters so I
knew there had to be something else and
then I would just complain like can we
just loosen up the schedule a little bit
can you just not put so many people on
there they&#39;re like time is money time is
money Milo you can&#39;t have your cake and
eat it too and I&#39;m like that is so
stupid that&#39;s what you&#39;re supposed to do
with cake
you&#39;re supposed to eat it like why not
it never made sense everybody says that
and it makes absolutely no sense
so I started realizing that in order for
me to get to the point where I could
have fun do surgery be the talking
plastic surgeon I probably couldn&#39;t do
it within the blueprint and the confines
of their structure so I said well my
contract is up I&#39;m probably just gonna
need to go out on my own so I met with
SBA loan consultant to work on my
business plan and at our first meeting
he looked at me and he said so what&#39;s
your goal
and for the first time I never knew this
was my goal it kind of just fell out of
my mouth when he asked me I thought I
was I think it was God dropping it down
in my spirit and putting you know
letting me know where I was headed but I
said my goal is to make plastic surgery
a hobby he was like huh
you&#39;re gonna make being a plastic
surgeon a hobby like that is like wait
so it was funny because he thought I was
crazy but I felt liberated when I said
it I&#39;m like yeah yeah plastic surgery&#39;s
gonna be Hobby right I had no idea how I
was gonna make that happen but the good
thing about hobbies is that you enjoy
them there&#39;s no pressure you&#39;re not
worried about money you know you do it
on your terms
that&#39;s how hobbies work that&#39;s what I
wanted plastic surgery to be except I
had no idea how I was gonna do that
so I&#39;ll go ahead and go through the
motions of making this business plan
with him I knew I sounded crazy every
time I would try to talk to people about
the way I was feeling they kind of
looked at me like I was crazy
they&#39;re like you&#39;re you should like why
aren&#39;t you happy like you&#39;re a plastic
surgeon we like why aren&#39;t you happy and
I was happy with that I mean it was a
huge accomplishment less than 1% of
surgeons are african-american females so
I know that was kind of sweet that I
pulled that off right but it still just
wasn&#39;t enough like it wasn&#39;t enough I
knew I had more to give to this world
than just doing surgery on people I knew
that I there was more in me that God
wanted me to do so when my contract was
up I left I left that place I moved to
Atlanta no one knew me there I said I
didn&#39;t know where I was going to live we
were standing the hotel for a couple of
months I was a homeless plastic surgeon
didn&#39;t know where exactly where I was
gonna put my office but in the meantime
while I was getting all that stuff
sorted out everybody thought I was crazy
I just didn&#39;t listen to that stuff I
just kept listening to my intuition and
I got a contract position working for
this company that it was a liposuction
Center and all they did was lipo cheap
lipo and so I didn&#39;t even let them put
my name on the website I&#39;m like nobody
needs to know I&#39;m here until they get
here and see me don&#39;t put my name on
your site but it was a way for me to
start putting work out in the community
keep my keep my skills up while I was
getting this my practice thing figured
out and I had no idea what God was doing
what what he was doing with that whole
situation when I started working at that
place I interacted with so many women
who were pretty much putting their lives
in danger for liposuction they were
there because it was cheap the lot of
them came there after they got it cheap
surgery somewhere else and guy
disfigured as I started to preach to
these ladies I&#39;m like wait a minute okay
I once I got to realize the the common
theme amongst the people who came there
I would say what made you choose this
place because they didn&#39;t know I was
there okay so I would understand if they
knew I was there why they chose the
place they didn&#39;t know so they would
tell me the price the price is that if
you choose a plastic surgeon based on
the lowest bidder that gives you the
highest likelihood of dying from it that
gives you the highest likelihood of
being botched from it and that was like
the sole thing that they were using to
decide who they will go where they would
go so I pretty much became obsessed with
this whole thing and I started
researching and the more I looked around
I realized that there were way worse
situations women were putting themselves
in and I felt like there&#39;s got to be
something I can do to like show people
and help people like shake them and make
them understand that there&#39;s something
that this isn&#39;t how you do it and this
is not safe so I just did what I knew
best I started running my mouth I got on
Facebook
push live on Facebook live and started
talking about the dangers of plastic
surgery I started talking about the ways
the people you should have the
situations you should avoid when looking
for plastic surgery I talked about all
these things I was basically against
plastic surgery well I&#39;m trying to set
up a plastic surgery practice and
everybody&#39;s like milah do you think
maybe you shouldn&#39;t do that because
maybe you won&#39;t get patients if you keep
talking about how dangerous plastic
surgery is now nothing inside of me felt
like it was wrong even though it kind of
didn&#39;t make any sense the weirdest thing
happened the more I spoke the more
patients I got the more I spoke I got
news and media opportunities speaking
engagements because everybody wanted to
hear this plastic surgeon was talking
against plastic surgery and the ladies
who were interested in plastic surgery
they knew that I wasn&#39;t going to put
them in danger when I was teaching them
how to be safe it made them trust me so
even though it sounded crazy and went
against what my what most people&#39;s into
not my intuition but what most people&#39;s
intuition would tell them to do when
they&#39;re trying to grow a business in
that field I still did it because God my
intuition told me to do it so what I
want to do is help you figure out how to
get down your path of what you should be
doing in the situation that you&#39;re in
in my opinion the key thing that you
need to do is first which I was missing
at first I didn&#39;t realize that I didn&#39;t
have this I didn&#39;t understand all this
purpose stuff and you know in medical
school and residency nobody cares about
purpose they care about teaching you
medicine teaching you how to do surgery
the bottom line and results nobody gave
a crap about purpose I didn&#39;t hear about
that stuff until I got out of that world
well I&#39;m not out of the world but until
I got out of the structure of that world
I think it&#39;s here about that stuff but I
think it&#39;s important that you have a
mission for your life so for me what my
mission turned into was I wanted to be
able to inspire women to live confident
lives and unleash their inner and their
outer beauty what I realized with all
with all those women who were putting
their lives in danger is that the inner
stuff was messed up because if you
really love yourself on the inside you
won&#39;t put your life in danger for some
liposuction there&#39;s stuff on me that I
don&#39;t like and I&#39;m not gonna change it
if it&#39;s gonna put me at risk so I felt
like it was important for me to be able
to help women to get their inner beauty
out also so anytime an opportunity comes
along if it&#39;s not in alignment with that
mission that I have it&#39;s out of here if
it violates my inner and outer beauty
unleashing a woman&#39;s inter and outer
beauty if it violates that I&#39;m not gonna
do it
I know because that came that came to me
from God I know if I stay in alignment
with that that I&#39;m doing what he wants
me to do that&#39;s the first thing get a
mission for your life that might change
over the course of your life that&#39;s fine
but get a mission the second thing is
when your intuition starts telling you
something when you start feeling shifty
or like this I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s
something else listen because I believe
that your intuition is God whispering to
you that he&#39;s trying to take you in a
different direction and you have to
listen to it the problem is most people
will get that intuition and then they&#39;ll
start praying I&#39;m gonna pray about it
praying is good I pray all the time but
you can&#39;t just pray you got to move to
when God answers the prayer if you don&#39;t
like the answer you can&#39;t just ignore to
start praying some more right that&#39;s
what people do
gonna pray I&#39;m like well probably if you
talking to me about this you already
prayed about it and God dropped me and
your presence to help you move it&#39;s time
to move you got to move when you start
to do have those prayers and listen to
what he&#39;s whispering to your soul so
even when I had this intuition to talk
about the dangers of plastic surgery God
had to he knew what he was doing I
didn&#39;t know exactly what he was doing
but I knew I was supposed to use this
mouthpiece and start teaching and
sharing and saving people that was that
came first the third thing you have to
do is channel your inner toddler what
does that mean right have you ever
watched the toddler play like a
two-year-old they could care less who&#39;s
watching them they could care less what
other people think if it&#39;s something
that they want and is in your hand
they&#39;ll walk right up to you and take it
and walk off and play with it they don&#39;t
care somebody like that&#39;s where they
don&#39;t care they spend their entire day
exploring and doing what their intuition
tells them to do and over the course of
that few years of being a toddler they
grow exponentially adults grow slowly
because we&#39;re too busy worried about
what they think what they said if it&#39;s
safe am I gonna die
am I gonna be able to pay my bills all
these things we start thinking to keep
us stuck and to keep us praying over and
over again over the same thing that got
answered already so you need to channel
your inner toddler when you start to
feel unrest that&#39;s because you&#39;re
supposed to be doing something else if
it&#39;s something that you want to do go do
it there&#39;s never gonna be a perfect time
you&#39;re never gonna be feel ready but if
you want to step into that zone that God
has created just for you you have to
channel your inner Tyler that prettiest
part of your soul you have to dig into
that you have to go decide to go and
move when he tells you to move so that
you can go and boldly step into the life
that God has created for you thank you
you
you
