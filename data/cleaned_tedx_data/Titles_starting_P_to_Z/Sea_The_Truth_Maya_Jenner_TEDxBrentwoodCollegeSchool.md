hi guys
so human nature is a distinct set of
characteristics that we tend to
associate with if not all most human
beings naturally it is an our human
nature to put ourselves first and
generally speaking we&#39;re selfish in most
aspects of our lives realizing this led
me to the Epiphany that our greatest
Drive and motivation is our own
selfishness we&#39;re most passionate about
the things that we experience for his
hand so those things that I wanted to an
issue that a lot of people don&#39;t think
pertains to them but actually has great
potential to be detrimental to all of
our lives and that is the issue of
commercial and overfishing of sharks
leaving them closer and closer to
extinction so even so caught up with all
the negative stigma around sharks rather
than the actual scientific proof that
these cartilaginous fishes are way more
valuable alive than dead sharks have
been on this earth for more than 400
million years significantly longer than
even the dinosaurs they have survived
through five major extinctions that
wiped out majority of life on Earth
all of this and we have almost managed
to wipe them out within the last century
or so top contributors to the dwindling
shark population is commercial fishing
and under that you have shark finning by
catching long lines etc we are the
number one reason they&#39;re going extinct
but they&#39;re not even close to the top of
the list of danger sighs I mean more
Ducks are cause of a year by coconuts
falling on our heads by dogs vending
machines kill ten times more people
every year than sharks you so thank you
Bart wood for being smart enough to keep
them off of our campus mostly perfect so
you see how we overestimate the danger
of sharks so much you probably didn&#39;t
know that on average only one shark
attack every two years is fatal to
humans whereas by the time I finished
his speech 1834 sharks would have been
killed by Simmons alone so where are we
getting this false information why are
we so afraid of sharks that we can&#39;t
even advocate for them
the main stigma comes from the media
iconic shows the movies such as the jaws
franchise big blue sea
Shark Week although entertaining leaves
sharks in a very negative light and
portrays them in a way that is utterly
terrifying and completely false you see
we are being left uneducated and afraid
by the media which is why I&#39;m here to
hopefully D Signet eyes sharks and I&#39;m
gonna start doing that by debunking a
bit big myths about them which is that
they always want to eat humans sharks
are curious and dominant features of the
ocean and since they don&#39;t have limbs
their way of exploring an object or
organism is sibenik these are called
test bites and they&#39;re simply
exploratory now I understand that most
of us probably wouldn&#39;t be preferred to
get bit by shark but we have to realize
that they don&#39;t have bad intentions and
you see how in the majority of shark
attacks the victims do survive because
the sharks will take one bite and leave
this is because sharks more accustomed
to the higher fat content and fish&#39;s
blood than in ours so take a seat honey
because you&#39;re definitely not as
appetizing as you think so we&#39;ve never
lived in the world without these cages
and I&#39;m gonna hope that we don&#39;t have to
because of the future that the future
that professionals and researchers
predict are grim now we&#39;ve talked about
the problem let&#39;s talk about the effects
sharks have a very intricate inter
balance with their ecosystem they are
the top of the food chain the bud patel
of the sea so shark sharks are apex
predators meaning they control pretty
much all of sharing population under
them let&#39;s say that sharks go extinct in
a certain area certain types of species
will begin to reproduce without a
predator to limit their reproduction
they will begin to eat their prey most
likely to extinction at least in that
area and without smaller fish to eat all
the algae you end up with oceans that
look like this so now not only do you
have an ocean that&#39;s messed up
underneath but on the surface as well
another thing that sharks do is they
regulate they play a big role in the
oceanic natural selection so they tend
to eat weak sake or old fish leaving a
much stronger gene pool for them to
reproduce in a lot of research also feed
on dead carcasses at the bottom of the
ocean and this all helps keep diseases
from breaking out within the fish
population and ultimately into humans
once we ingest them lastly researchers
also look at sharks and their patterns
to predict hurricanes and other not
so there&#39;s definitely not a shortage of
ways that we benefit from strikes at
least environmentally but you know what
let&#39;s say you don&#39;t live anywhere near
the water you don&#39;t care about the ocean
why should you take action again for the
shakes well you should because whether
you live on a beach in Hawaii or in the
middle of Manitoba chunks are going to
affect the economy and the economy is
going to affect you so I want to talk to
you guys about 3 min industries that try
to play a big role in and the first one
is a shark cartilage industry there&#39;s
been a huge rise in demand for shark
cartilage because it is believed to cure
a lot of sicknesses including cancer
however this is not true there is no
scientific proof that Lynx shark
cartilage with cancer treatment
the second industry I want to talk to
you guys about is probably the bigger
ones and the one that you guys are
probably most familiar with which is
shark finning shark finning is a huge
industry ruling in literally billions of
dollars every year
however sharks are slow growing food
choice and they wait until they&#39;re about
25 before they reproduce and because of
that we are slaughtering them to the
brink of extinction and I say slaughter
because that&#39;s really what it is take a
look at this video
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so you can see how the way that
fisherman fin sharks it&#39;s really cruel
you saw them cut off their fins and
throw the Sharks back in the water and I
think something that a lot of people are
you know is that these sharks that are
being thrown back in the water the
Sharks that you saw at the bottom of sea
most of them are still alive they&#39;re
suffocating and they can&#39;t move but they
are still alive so that&#39;s definitely
really sad but not only is that callous
it is simply a waste because on average
during shark finning only about ten
percent of the shark is actually used so
now you have these commercial boats
coming in to local waters threatening
the traditional sustainable fisheries
and taking away the jobs of countless
people who depend on sustainable shark
fishing
for livelihood and sable needs which is
probably why wondering why I&#39;m defending
these fisheries the difference between
the two is one fish&#39;s sharks at a rate
that allows them to keep up with second
population growth whereas the other
fishes them in ways that are not only
cruel and a waste but in ways they&#39;re
mostly illegal and in ways that don&#39;t
allow the shark population to keep up
now the last industry I want to talk to
you guys about is the ecotourism
industry so with eco tourism ecotourism
is the tourism of natural exotic
environments and sharks play a really
big role in this a shark in Bahamas
alive is worth about two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars whereas they&#39;re
only worth about $150 when caught by a
fisherman a shark in sabah malaysia is
worth about eight hundred and fifteen
dollars alive whereas compared to the
price of only a hundred dollars when
it&#39;s caught by fishermen and on average
a whale shark can bring in about two
million dollars over its lifetime and
ecotourism so you see you have all of
this research linking sharks to tourism
and showing how they are way more
valuable to us alive than dead we live
on this tiny blue marble of a world
right the only home that we&#39;ve ever
known if we don&#39;t start if we don&#39;t
start acting in a positive way it&#39;s
going to come back to bite us in the
butt this issue may seem small to you
right now and your contribution may seem
small but little things are going to add
up to make a really big difference so
let&#39;s start by saving the shark
what can you do to help the Sharks well
you can donate online you can look up
ways to volunteer but most importantly
you can speak out about this issue and
you can educate yourself and the others
and the others around you on the truth
about sharks because it&#39;s time that we D
Sigma ties them a wise man once said
wise men Paul watts on one side what was
you to do is to rock the boat to make
people think and to make some noise so I
think we&#39;ve all learned our lesson today
say away from vending machines no but I
really hope I opened your eyes on this
issue and I hope I&#39;ve inspired you to
hopefully do something because I do
think that the time that we give sharks
a chance so shellfish or not you got to
save the Sharks thank you
