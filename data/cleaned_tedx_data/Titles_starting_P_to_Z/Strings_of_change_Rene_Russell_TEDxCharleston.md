[Music]
okay so I have two of my songs to share
with you today the first one is called
speck of truth and it&#39;s my view or maybe
I should say in my opinion of the world
today it goes like this
[Music]
standing on this water ball floating in
a crystal sky
well I wonder how and let them make the
cut we refine its back through what we
want
they say the end is near but no one
really knows so we&#39;ll just keep on
burning oil
and hoarding gold
[Music]
world&#39;s cuz I had while people move at
any time between the lies or what were
you doing what they arrived we live in
fuse with Ollie here&#39;s what we&#39;re told
believing only wars will keep us on the
phone so I watch people wearing heat
treating their clothes they forgot about
their here to grow is soul
roll that soul well angels are watch
from lofty heights above while our
religion was fain to teach us about love
you just ignore that little man behind
the screen because the wizard T to tell
you what it means they say
[Music]
so you just keep sending gold to our TV
shows whoa
[Music]
well here amidst chaos and debris
I hear a prayer ensue I fall upon my
knees if you recall it&#39;s always darkest
before dawn so we will lift our voices
above the throne and word of a million
souls join this song I believe here at
the end we&#39;ll get the truth weird
oh we&#39;re gonna get that spell
just a little speck have true that&#39;s
what we&#39;ll get
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so there&#39;s that and then we hope that we
go here from there and I think it takes
each and every one of us to get us there
so
