so a few weeks ago I was on my way to
Washington DC for a conference and as is
my habit I pick up my cup of Starbucks
at the airport drew a drive my little
rollaway suitcase on to the bookstore
looking for something to read on the
plane and so and I go to the bookstore I
was browsing the magazine section and I
found an issue of the Scientific
American now I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a nerd okay
I I love the Scientific American and I
was very excited to see an issue there
and when I saw the cover it said it&#39;s
not a woman&#39;s issue right up my alley so
I said hey you know I&#39;m gonna have some
great reading material on my train line
so I get on my plane I read the magazine
and I came across this really
fascinating and bothersome article
called the brilliant strap so the
authors Andrews in piane and Sarah Jane
Leslie came up with this premise that
women sometimes are not perceived as
brilliant as men now they didn&#39;t say
that women weren&#39;t as brilliant as men
because we know women are brilliant but
they said because of this perception
some women did enter certain careers now
that sounded bothersome to me they also
said as part of their research they
looked at professors calm and they found
that when students rate their professors
the rate their men professors as
brilliant ingenious and they rate their
women professors as amazing and
excellent again I I just I I know the
scientific America is a very good
magazine I know these people are
brilliant but I could not make my get my
head around that whole concept how can
women not be brilliant so I said I&#39;m
going to just make a quick list of the
first few brilliant people I can think
off and will disprove this whole theory
right so I love making lists on your
love weakness I&#39;ve lists about
everything anyway I digress so I made a
quick list and and this was my list
Einstein Newton Tesla Marie Curie and
Michael Faraday just like just at this
part of the moment one woman made it to
my list and she was not even on top of
my list and Marie Curie won two Nobel
prizes Einstein just won one
so why did she not make it the top of my
list that bothered me so I said you know
what I just need more data obviously as
a scientist I&#39;m always looking for more
data so I picked on the next person I
saw my son who goes to school in DC and
I said hey Kunal tell me who are the top
people who believe people you think
about and he said Elon Musk Warren
Buffett he goes to business school so I
guess this part of it but Einstein and
Socrates like okay this did work no
women on this list so I come back home
and I asked my other son Kabir I&#39;ve been
blessed with two sons so anyway I go
what the people I have around me so so
Kabir goes Einstein again Marie Curie
thank God a woman made his list
fritz haber and Isaac Newton so I asked
my husband and I to goes oh you know
Spielberg Churchill Edison and mr.
Hebert again I don&#39;t know what Fritz
Haber did I got a read up about this
have not had time to look him up yet but
he apparently is a brilliant person who
makes everybody&#39;s lists so so this was
bothersome four of us we come up with
one woman you come up with the same
woman and and I felt like this was not
right so I still want to disprove this
theory and so I I go out on Twitter and
I only follow cardiologists and other
physicians on Twitter so it&#39;s a
completely non-political audience and I
said hey guys and girls just said just
send me a list of some brilliant people
you know you know no order no historical
time just send me a list and and I got
lots of answers from all over the world
from my colleagues and I related them
being the nerd I am I made lists again
and this is what I got back there were
six women on this list and that is awful
there were so many men that I stopped
writing them I hear analysts like space
on my slide so I said okay enough
already
there&#39;s but this was this was the
general woman that showed up on most
people&#39;s lists and these are the same
women so why is that why are we not
having more women show up on people&#39;s
lists when we think of brilliant people
why are we not thinking of women why do
we not know their names we have a few
token women
they represent women that&#39;s not good
enough so when when you look at that it
really goes along with what those
authors said that people don&#39;t perceive
women as being brilliant and it&#39;s a
perception but it is extremely alarming
so when you think of a stereotype of a
brilliant person this is the picture in
our head and it shows up on many lists
over and over and over again you know
stereotypes are like antibiotic
resistant pathogens they can infect us
and they&#39;re so hard to get rid of so
it&#39;s it&#39;s this is a really important
issue because steer types can really
take hold of here so Carol Dweck who&#39;s
this brilliant social scientist says
once belief in one&#39;s ability matters
greatly in one success so like to unpack
that it says if you can believe it you
can achieve it I think Napoleon Hill
said that but if you look at these lists
of brilliant people and you don&#39;t see
any women there you could potentially
believe that maybe women aren&#39;t
brilliant and that is a big problem so
when does this start how do we get there
so Carol and her colleagues did some
really elegant research and they said
when kids are five years old both boys
and girls believe that they&#39;re equally
smart they both think they&#39;re really
really smart but by the age of seven
seven boys believe that they&#39;re great
grades are because of innate ability and
girls believe that they&#39;re great grades
are because of hard work now what
happens in those two years that makes
these children believe this children
just didn&#39;t come out of this out of free
air they&#39;ve heard this over and over
again from their teachers their parents
the media the world around them and
children are like sponges they absorb
everything around them they internalize
it they believe it all these grown-ups
around them they&#39;re obviously telling
them the truth right but this can change
the entire trajectory of their
lives this belief and we don&#39;t even know
what this belief is based on but this
persistent belief is changing lives so
let me tell you a story
I was recently out to lunch with a
friend of mine as a physician and she
and I told her look I&#39;m giving this TED
talk and then I&#39;m just you know it this
is my topic and we were just talking
about things and she said she has a
daughter who&#39;s just started preschool
and she says you have a great laugh
about this she said my daughter came
home the other day from school and said
mommy did you believe can you believe
that boys can be doctors too because in
her life all the doctors she knew were
women her mother was a doctor her
mother&#39;s friends were doctors she knew
no guys who were doctors so it does make
a difference you know I have a patient
that I&#39;ve been seeing for many years and
she came to my she&#39;s been bringing her
granddaughter to the office she&#39;s
raising this child and this girl&#39;s been
coming to my office since she was a baby
and and she&#39;s now I think in first grade
and the other day she was in the office
and she tapped me on the shoulder and
said doctor saying I&#39;m gonna be a doctor
just like you when I grow up and take
care of my grandma because she has seen
this she believes this is completely
possible so seeing is believing and so
it is important to be seen you know I
have faith in women I believe women can
do anything I believe they&#39;re amazing
they&#39;re brilliant they can run the
entire world and they can run it better
than what we&#39;ve had done before but
having faith is not enough we need more
women we need more women everywhere
doing everything so let me ask you a
riddle as father and son were going down
the road and they&#39;re in one a horrible
horrible traffic crash father dies in
the spot the sons rushed to the
emergency room the surgeon on call comes
down to take this child to the operating
room and stops and says I can&#39;t operate
on this child this is my son now
how do you think this child is related
to the surgeon so this was a question
that I put to many people I know people
I work with people at home my friends
and and I got some really interesting
answers and you know one was that this
is the child&#39;s stepfather the second was
the child&#39;s parents are a gay couple and
this is the other partner third the
conspiracy theorists they said that guy
in the car was not the father at all so
you know the fakeness guy said there was
no car accident this is just a made-up
story but the real answer that the
surgeon was the boy&#39;s mother was
something that 70% of people were not
able to figure out and and that doesn&#39;t
mean that they are bad people it just
means that the stereotype of being a
surgeon is still a man so I think that
it&#39;s important for us to recognize that
these stereotypes do exist and the
people I asked were other physicians
that were smart people and not be
anybody who thought of themselves as
having stereotypes oops
mr. Slade okay anyway so as a slide that
just went by you saw you know in
medicine we&#39;ve done a much better job of
recruiting more women so as medical
students in 1980 they were only about
20% of medical students are women now
about 47% of medical students are women
but when you get to cardiology which is
my specialty only 13% of cardiologists
are women and that is a number that has
remained steady over the last 15 years
now why do you ask is that happening so
if I give my example I went to a medical
school of women and we had 130 women in
my class two women our cardiologists me
and a friend of mine who&#39;s a pediatric
cardiologist I work in a group with 14
men have been the only woman there for
the last 15 years that I&#39;ve worked there
so when I was doing my internal medicine
residency and I decided I wanted to be a
cardiologist I said hey you know what I
want to be a cardiologist
and so they said why do you want to be a
cardiologist do you have a one-year-old
child do you have a doctor you&#39;re a
married to a doctor you should you know
try something easier they assumed that
because I was a wife a mother and a
woman I would want to do something
different when I went on my interviews I
was asked if I was married I was asked
if I had children I was asked if I
wanted to have more children and you
know they didn&#39;t nobody ever asked me if
this is what I really wanted to do and
at no point during this whole
conversation did anyone say are you
capable of this job I was the chief
resident of my internal medicine
residency program there was I had
wonderful letters you know I had loved
to do this but at no point during any of
these interviews if anyone questioned my
my capability of doing the job they just
questioned my desire or the question my
desire because I was a wife a mother and
a woman so this could be very
discouraging you know my husband
completely supported me during this time
he said if that&#39;s what you want to do
that&#39;s what you should do but if I
looked around and looked for other women
like me and I found them in a minority
I could easily believe that this might
not be for me and I wonder how many
well-meaning people were talked out of a
job because they had all these questions
asked for them and when they looked
around they found nobody in their dream
job who looked like them so we all have
stereotypes let&#39;s acknowledge the fact
that we have stereotypes because by not
acknowledging that we are even more
dangerous so you know recently we had an
election and irrespective of your
politics you know we could have had a
woman running the free world but that
didn&#39;t happen it&#39;s heartbreaking but you
know when Hillary Clinton said in her
speech to all the little girls who are
watching this never doubt that you are
valuable and powerful and deserving of
every chance and opportunity in the
world to pursue and achieve your dreams
she just didn&#39;t pick little girls for no
reason she was talking to the right
audience because that is where our
stereotypes start and that&#39;s where they
get deeply ingrained so my wish for all
of you today is please acknowledge that
you have stereotypes challenge your
stereotypes change the conversation so
we are no longer holding our girls back
from being brilliant thank you
