all right so let&#39;s say your neighbor now
falls asleep sitting next to you start
dozing you hear a noise would be
embarrassing noise how difficult would
it be for you to recognize that I&#39;ve
fallen asleep would be very busy right
the first thing as I said would be
trivial maybe you stop nudging down we
know how to recognize it when we see it
we learn to do this from when we are
kids basically and one big reality is
that we recognize not only when it
happens in individuals of our own
species but also in animals if you walk
to your room and you see your dog cat
whatever patches have hamster asleep you
recognize they are asleep now what if I
ask you about this flood what is he
doing
difficult to say right
it&#39;s basically possible to say and the
reason why it&#39;s impossible to say is
because we don&#39;t know what sleepies if
he knew was leap walls perhaps you would
have a way to look into the plant at the
cell level maybe even at the behavioral
level and say yes it is asleep and now
my squadron plant can sleep or not my
sound like a silly question and in fact
it&#39;s not it might sound like a silly
question even to some of the legs of
mine but it&#39;s not it&#39;s actually one of
the most fundamental question you can
ask about sleep is it asleep just for us
is asleep asleep just for animals able
to move and think and learn or is a a
general feature of any living thing and
as I said we don&#39;t know this and we&#39;re
very very far from answering this
question what we know at all is that
extremely compared concern in the animal
kingdom as I say you recognize me
hamster you recognize sleeping mice rats
horses elephants any animal really you
even recognize leaping fruit flies even
though they don&#39;t have eyelids so you
can see whether they eyes are closed a
lot and so we work based on this
assumption to study sleep that&#39;s what my
lab does the DPD College we try to
understand the sleeps four and we mainly
use fruit flies as an animal model now
this is a bit of a caveat and my dog is
going to be allowed caveat and now we
use them in science I like to think that
is something that is interesting for you
guys but my actually be up interesting
also for colleagues because it&#39;s a
reminder of some tablets that sometimes
we get for granted and then we forgot
about them and they become a bit of
dogma and so one of these dog more the
first one I want to talk about is the
fact sleep is actually for the brain as
I said we don&#39;t have any evidence for
this to actually set up an experiment
and see what the sleep is only for the
brain would require us to be able to
have an animal or a human or a person
where the brain is asleep but the body
is not or the other way around the body
is asleep but the brain is awake and we
cannot do that because we don&#39;t know
what sleepies so indeed we will be able
to do that kind of experiment the fact
that sleep is only for the brain remains
a very major assumption and it&#39;s an
assumption that as I said is the dogma
we even have our own mantra you read on
the scientific literature the sleep of
the brain by the brain for the brain and
most of the time when you assign this
really don&#39;t push this dogma very far we
are captivated and it&#39;s not because we
are sloppy but because at one point
science has to compromise you have to
compromise and do what you can otherwise
you&#39;ll never in forward and so we&#39;ve
been compromising with this in my
opinion for a bit too long now science
has changed and we are almost ready to
treat sleep
not as a problem science north as
something that is porn brain but it&#39;s a
problem of cell biology the main reason
why I like to do this is because we have
to recognize our failure otherwise
impacting sleep as a problem on your
sites so we&#39;ve been working on sleep
with modern science let&#39;s say for the
past hundred 150 years of course this is
the question that is much older than
that goes back to in fact some of the
oldest piece of writings you&#39;ll ever
find
but from the scientific point of view I
think we go we go back 100 hundred 50
years and we&#39;ve been tackling as I said
this problem very much from the brain
point of view and especially ever since
we discovered the brains
I mean Electrical ways that we can
record you might learn the business
EEG and and buzzing discover is that
these waves are actually different
whether you&#39;re looking of a sleeping
brain or a brain is awake and so most of
the research on sleep concentrate on the
suspect on how these waves might be
related to the function of sleep and why
are they different and why during
certain phases of sleep for instance
when you are very much deep asleep the
waves are very very different from other
phases of sleep for instance when you
are in peril Amgen&#39;s
or while some of these ways are
identical between you state of
wakefulness and some other stages of
sleep so there are plenty of puzzles if
you wanted to start working on these
keep you busy for probably that&#39;s my
point another 150 years so we need to
realize that maybe we&#39;re barking at the
wrong tree and try some other strategy
and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do in my
lab and it&#39;s not just my lab is that
many other laboratories starting to
think about this and that&#39;s why fruit
fly is became a really powerful
promising model for solving this issue
at least in principle so first thing as
I say we want to
as a cell biology problem it&#39;s something
that doesn&#39;t effect on your brain
effects all in themselves and in a way
we know this is the cage because we know
that when you&#39;re sleep-deprived yes your
brain your performance your ability to
learn and memorize your ability to
sustain exams really declines but
overall it&#39;s your body suffers from lack
of sleep and sleep deprivation has
plenty of effects on your metabolism on
your skin so the my visa underlying
fundamental issue that links sleep with
linking sleeps sleep to single cell to
single cell biology so probably time to
start looking for it before going there
I think another aspect that we have to
solve is a second dogma which says that
sleep is fundamental and vital and this
is something that again is very much
sustained by evidence it&#39;s not something
we made up it very much depends on the
fact that sleep is universally conserved
across the pollution as I said you see
you use the science of sleep fruit flies
the words in jellyfish on the way to
humans and and this is obviously brought
to a hypotheses where if all animals
requires me it is because link is
required by the enemy you must be doing
something that is really really
important you must be vital so the
evolutionary conservation sleep the
first evidence for its importance the
other evidence comes from sleep
deprivation studies we know from studies
were done actually at the end of the
1800 in dogs that sleep deprivation is
lethal those who are very pretty big
studies they are not pretty repeated at
least not in dogs but who will do the
stuff anymore as
plus the hundred fifty years fifty years
ago some of the studies were repeating
brats and again Shawn the Swift
intubation is lethal Congrats brats will
die up to three weeks of sleep
depravation we don&#39;t have data from
humans really have some anecdotal report
from things like this finishing this
issue but you&#39;ll agree that that&#39;s not
quite the level of science we aspire to
it&#39;s very difficult to draw a conclusion
about whether sleep deprivation is
lethal in humans that are again
experiments if you want to call them the
most famous one the 90s when a student
about your age decided we wanted went
into the Guinness Book of record sorry
problem medical doctor long and for
eleven days he made sure that his doctor
was and other Doc&#39;s of wood looking at
him make sure that he wouldn&#39;t fall
asleep and record them a single moment
and if single tivity so that they could
enter in the Guinness Book of record and
he basically went to this 11 days long
experiment he ended up in the Guinness
Book of record back then and now we were
possible to do because the it&#39;s not the
kind of experiment that they really want
to have in that kind of book and by
chemicals 11 days and the experiment was
included because the poor fellow was
quite miserable
it was very aggressive the rages he
started hitting elucidation so I really
was paying at all for lack of sleep but
at the same time there were moments
throughout the day where it was pretty
ok he could still play chess could still
play basketball could still all the
conversation so was not falling apart
when the experiment finished at the end
of those 11 days went to sleep and he
didn&#39;t sleep for a week like you would
imagine just left for maybe three four
hours more than you would usually do
and when you woke up it was refreshed so
these are the kind of fascinating
findings that we have to deal with and
they&#39;re really difficult interpret as we
have done this we have to explain one
end why is it sleep so important that is
present on all animals but on the other
end outcomes can go days without it
without any manger consequence we don&#39;t
know maybe prolonging experiment would
have kill the profile but it&#39;s not
weapon so we do experiments with animals
to solve this issue one thing that I
think we should address first is to try
and think of sleep a bit differently
from what we do now how we do now and
here is again my approach is to try and
compare sleep to actually another
biological need to talk animals have and
that&#39;s stealing
now when you we know that why you why
you why you why we eat we know why
pretty much call animals at will eat we
know what happens at the single cell
level when you eat white color is
important why energy is important for
your body to function we know a great
deal about feeding and we know for
instance that adult like us needs about
2,000 calories a day and that&#39;s really
the bare minimum to survive it sustains
your activities it keeps you basically
working sometimes you need a bit more if
you&#39;re training you&#39;re exercising going
to the gene you want to run a marathon
or you study for exams you want to be
well fed and so that component of food
that get is the accessory but useful
component while the first one is the
vital component and finally there is a
third component which is the you know
the one we all like but we don&#39;t really
need and my me an extra piece is getting
to three regular people and one thing
that you
experience we all experience is that at
one point you get used to the bear
component but much I&#39;ve come to mean for
instance after I came back in the States
there was a bit overweight of the
stereotype requires came to England said
I should just lose a couple of kilos so
I went to a diet and I realized that the
third component of feeding I was
something that I was crowding with the
same intensity as you will grab
something that you didn&#39;t eat it wasn&#39;t
super straightforward to give up that
this cake or the beer it was something
that I thought my body really needed and
actually the more you get used to that
that&#39;s the component the more you think
your body needed and people who are
obese really claim they have a really
hard time giving up the extra calories
and it&#39;s true they&#39;re not making it up
so your body a one boy fools you into
believing that there is something that
you think you need but you don&#39;t because
you cook very well with the other two
components of feeding the necessary one
and the useful but not necessary and so
what if it was the same for sleep the
mind will be you might will be actually
that we don&#39;t need to sleep 9 hours day
yes if we don&#39;t we feel a bit grumpy and
kind of feel the consequence and we
crave it but what if it&#39;s the same as if
for food so that&#39;s something again that
we are not really very much considering
in research and I something that we&#39;re
trying to push for the idea that there
is a component of link that is mildly
vital and a component asleep that may be
useful but accessory and finally a third
component sleep that may be my to speak
YouTube or down or to us getting used to
it the other evidence for this here is
that amount of sleep really varies
throughout evolution so bats in a cave
they can sleep
twenty-one hours a day and horses they
are fine with 3-4 hours of sleep today
even with among people some people need
less than hours of sleep some other
people are totally fine with five
usually head of states head of
government the claim that can be
absolutely okay with three - not sure I
believe that but it&#39;s a recurrent theme
Clinton from agriculture all people
simply Berlusconi all people claim they
could go on with two three hours of
sleep
other people like Churchill for instance
really was proud of his siesta in Fe
so we only different amount of sleep and
that might be because there is not a
single function and the fact that is not
a single function is also I would say
pushed by the observation that as I
mentioned before animals like bats need
21 hours of sleep now if sleep was
linked to only your learning and memory
performance to you&#39;re being smart that
bus will have to be really really smart
animals they might be but they don&#39;t
really show it so the might be more the
mindless component of sleep actually
that is there to keep us out of trouble
for instance so that night we stay in
room and we don&#39;t venture in this
apartment is that that would be that
ventures so these are done with this
components is a nod respect of research
that I think is really very important
and the way we do it is with conclude
here by using fruit flies of the set now
when I argue the test very surprising
the you are prompted last week do flies
let it sleep as where it&#39;s guess
otherwise I would be really wasting my
time
we know that they sleep or at least they
do something that looks like sleep
because they are the satisfies really
what we say anonymously agree are the
five text definition of sleep they have
a species specific posture which means
that during the night they lean on their
legs like this there are also changes
which means that during the day you
might be able to just have them fly away
by approaching your hand but as they
fall asleep because stimulus and also
you can give them coffee and then stay
awake or you can sleep deprive them and
will be really really tired after so
these are all aspects of sleep that is
conserved throughout evolution
and within study in fruit flies and what
we do is we try to limit to take away
the crown of the problem from
traditional brain centric human centric
question that sleep is by the brain for
mammals humans and we translate into a
animal model that is more amenable for
genetic manipulations so that one day
perhaps we might be able to trigger the
gene that makes the animal asleep but
only in the brain of the fly or only the
body fly and then we&#39;ll be able to
answer questions like it sleep only for
the brain or not
