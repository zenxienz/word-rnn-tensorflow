wait I just forgot the picnic it&#39;s
happening to ourselves as well I can&#39;t
keep running in circles and came for
cutting my opening line see I know how
this ends it ends with the title
uncertainty as the fuel for creativity
but my proclivity to figure out the end
before I begin is easily with the sin of
not knowing how to begin with it in the
first place this has been happening
since school ever since I studied the
Pythagoras theorem in a right-angled
triangle the square of the hypotenuse is
equal to the sum of the squares of its
of adjacent sides a squared plus B
squared is equal to n square 3 4 5 7 24
25 five 12 30 that is all I&#39;ve ever been
taught the teacher would repeat a narc
you out down each line each word each
arithmetic sign theorems were the only
reason I wouldn&#39;t whine because for the
first time in a long time mathematics
felt fine I already knew the answer I
had to find boxed inside a pattern of
repetition all wrapped up together as a
derivation tradition was never on the
cards for us and see the CD does look
like a kid what had happened with
Pythagoras did he cut out the triangles
and put it back together and figure this
out or did he just mash together various
shapes and then calculate the area what
if you just write down multiple formula
let&#39;s figure out which one matches with
the dragon how ready knew the end the
same way there are no tears right now
this is not high school anymore and this
is definitely not a math Excel right now
my mind is this mental traffic jam of
multiple scale he&#39;s running through my
memories trying to figure out the right
beginning while I keep mumbling and I
keep stalling but this isn&#39;t fair on
your part I mean should have come with
the money given I don&#39;t believe this is
happening guys I know this is a warning
but can I just get the prom for the
first time
I think that I kept recording understand
towards good morning good morning as
awkward and stupid as that might have
been it was completely orchestrated and
rigorous as you might have already
guessed can&#39;t leave everything up to
tons of candy but why can&#39;t we what is
it about uncertainty that makes us
tremble in the face of it what is it
about our obsession to know everything
for certain even before we begin with it
in the first place don&#39;t feel of
surprises we all do especially when you
open the door and see that your friends
are throwing a surprise party for you or
when you win the sake draw or when
chocolates fly actually right out of
nowhere because of surprises but not
every time especially when you&#39;re
heading back home on your bike and it
starts raining and you don&#39;t have your
rain gear and you receive an SMS saying
that the examination results have been
declared and we all know how well you
studied for that exam by the way you
check the SMS while it was raining so
now your phone&#39;s dead or at times when
you&#39;re on stage speaking at a TEDx event
when all of a sudden will never be
trained to face uncertainty forget
facing it I believe we&#39;ll never even
registered the existence of it
we have always preferred when things
have had a specific format associated
with them because all the advice all the
visit of all the stories have stemmed
right from it I studied engineering and
took up a job before diving headfirst
into the art form that I loved the most
film without really knowing much about
the art form
see that phrasing it says art form it is
so loaded because it suppose that then
it will presuppose that art has a
specific form of expression and that is
exactly the lens through which I began
looking at filmmaking as well until I
realized that it&#39;s very essence stemmed
from uncertainty
film editing was discovered by accident
when the film jammed inside a
while it was recording giving rise to
the first cut that completely changed
the way we would tell stories forever
and that is exactly what I feel about
spoken word as well because it has
evolved into multiple forms such as slam
poetry prose monologue hip-hop stand-up
routines it seems to have a creative
freedom associated with it
that allowed me to write poetry that
maybe wasn&#39;t exactly poetry it was more
of me stealing widely in the sea of
words trying to find something that
would rival time with the meter until I
realized that spoken word did not
necessarily have to write the first time
was the worst crime kinda like this life
which seems fine until you listen to
this line nine times and then begin to
pine for a life that does not rhyme
spoken word can also be a monologue
where I talk about beautiful incidents
from my life
thattaboy degree beautiful faithful or
even downright hilarious like the time
back in school when my drawing skills
were incomprehensible no not in an
avant-garde or surreal kind of way maybe
sorry because I ended up drawing a horse
that looked like a frog and I don&#39;t know
how but it&#39;s funny how that seemed to be
the reason for choosing engineering over
animation when that latter seemed to be
my vocation back when it wasn&#39;t up and
rising career option but an up and
rising career option also meant not
enough job security only to fast forward
10 years later than see myself write and
direct 250 animated videos in a span of
18 months but that&#39;s a completely
different story however it made me
realize an important truth that I would
like to share
with you and it does have a little bit
of a rhythm when I put it right so now I
need your help and energy to do this
because with spoken word we&#39;re gonna do
it like this that&#39;s right that&#39;s how
it&#39;s gonna beat your toy to hip-hop
cannot beat poetry all we need is a beat
and be able to write us and the super
suits to throw some light upon I&#39;ve
traveled beyond my comfort zones walk my
fingers down to the bone
Jones would never condone this troubles
heart is broken or well fall season from
my own body like this so make some noise
to the next degree and put up your hands
for sta so when I say you say when you
say
exit so flex your yours and mop by one
this will be the best thing you&#39;ve ever
heard wonder your passion and chase your
dreams and your success will be
guaranteed is the worst advice anyone
[Applause]
that the journey is uncertain but the
destination will always be success no
nothing is true nothing is ever
guaranteed I&#39;m standing here right
before you speaking at a TEDx event not
simply as a result of my past
achievements persistence and hard work
things always seem to make sense when
seen in retrospect you can connect the
dots and see how they let you to be
where you are right now but when you
look back to connect the dots there are
so many missing spots that are actual
representations of uncertainties of luck
and chance and failure and circumstance
things beyond our control the
opportunities we get the people we read
they are like the special cards in an
Ono deck that can change the game in
your favor
Omega twas said I am too inexperienced
and young to give any advice but what I
do know for sure is that our
antagonistic perspective towards
uncertainty is our biggest problem that
we continue to look at it from our
conditions of life perspectives that we
will embrace it or will even get off
shore of the end and that holds us back
keeps us leashed to one can we really
want to run down the road but fear being
mowed down by the car none of this
because that will here today did
wouldn&#39;t it because they had the
ultimate formula for success or that
they could somehow see the future and
know they were going to be successful no
all we ever have is a vision and no
guarantee of success and that&#39;s the
scariest part but the sciences and arts
have always emerged from uncertainty
they have been powered by uncertainty
they have survived on uncertainty
creativity has emerged when our minds
have been brave enough to wander into
the what-if zone but nothing was
true nothing was ever defined and
through these explorations through this
modern have sometimes emerged
experiences that have shaped the
audience or inventions that have shaped
the humankind and for that to happen we
need to start looking at uncertainty as
a potential and not an obstacle and it&#39;s
difficult trust me even I am struggling
with uncertainty but there is no other
way
and if evolved with uncertainty depth
ability evolved through the ages with it
we don&#39;t know a future right but we do
know a past so let&#39;s go back to the
beginning of time when there was nothing
at all until a voice spoke let there be
light and then there was light right as
bride could be hungry tough within every
voice it could see this wasn&#39;t the light
of sight it was an illumination of the
creative kind that gave rise to galaxies
quasars planets and the human mind but
not at first as we started to understand
if he needed tales or opposable thumbs
on each hand but slowly and steadily our
spines rose up to face the world and our
eyes rose up to see the Sun and I am
strained hard to listen to the voice
that began it all and tell us what
needed to be done because the night was
dark and full of terrors and in the age
of survival there was no room for errors
but nobody knew what was gonna happen
next
so we next our text on the dark cave
walls made moving images through the
nightfall waiting for that voice to tell
us something and we kept waiting and
waited until we began working from
smashing rocks together to drilling the
soil from constructing dogs to striking
oil we have died asleep going through
the ages filling
with numerous pages of staring
point-blank into the void looking for
light and all you&#39;ve ever seen is
darkness of the unknown
our biggest inventions might be
accidental discoveries the most powerful
revelations as unknown mysteries history
might have nothing to offer except for a
series of stories presented as a buffet
of chance and love but but we forgot it
is that chance and luck for not
instances of fun they were more in spent
at the battlefront looking above at the
night sky where stars will shine and
comets will fly and we would try really
hard to listen to the voice that began
it all
and as you know met with nothing but
silence we began to realize that the
stories were wrong our origins were
nothing but a farce a light did not
emerge out of a voice to be stars
we were not handed the blueprints to
manufacture fears and cars they were no
voices telling us what we had to do no
tool guides or prophets of future gazing
go to the steam machines and the flight
ships the sea voyages and the rain our
lives they were signs of people heading
into the unknown in spite of the jitters
reaching the pond they chose to be
thrown in the pools diamond by their own
volition hunting for the slightest
semblance of a solution pulled deeper
within by their own calling of moving
ahead and continued falling realizing
that we never had a voice out there to
guide us but we always had a voice that
spoke within us because every time
darkness has been in our sights
we have always ignited
[Music]
