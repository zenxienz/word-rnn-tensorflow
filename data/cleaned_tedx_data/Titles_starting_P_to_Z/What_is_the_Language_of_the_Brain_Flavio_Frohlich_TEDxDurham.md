[Music]
oh that was that was terrible
Wow did you recognize what it was yeah
Beethoven&#39;s 5th Symphony almost do you
see what we&#39;ve done we&#39;ve misaligned in
time the individual instruments they did
not play together you&#39;ve heard them but
you what you heard was not really what
you wanted to hear the timing was off
the individual instruments were not
aligned in time they were not
synchronized they did not share the same
clock or the same time now I apologize
that you had to listen to that but
there&#39;s a point to it
now typically fortunately it does not
sound like that and there&#39;s an obvious
reason and the reason is the conductor
right the conductor provides that time
reference the conductor provides a clock
such a musicians know when and how to
play such an overall music emerges and
not what you&#39;ve just heard so let&#39;s
listen to it again this time with
conductor there you go
you had to wait for it but it was worth
it
[Music]
that is music
that is synchronization that is the
individual musicians within the
orchestra playing together being on the
same clock and we can visualize this in
a much simpler way what you see here is
blue and yellow two rhythms two parts of
the music and they&#39;re nicely aligned in
time as illustrated by the yellow lines
data sync recession different elements
in this case the musicians coming
together being on the same clock all
right so I don&#39;t study Beethoven yeah my
name is dr. Flavia frolic I&#39;m an
assistant professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and I run
a research lab and we study the brain
now the principle of synchronization
that have just demonstrated to you with
Beethoven&#39;s fifth that we believe is a
fundamental mechanism of how the brain
works that ability for different parts
to come together in time to synchronize
is not only how your brain works it also
what we need to consider to understand
the biological basis of disorders of the
central nervous system such as a
theatrical Ness
it encompasses depression schizophrenia
autism spectrum disorders and many other
illnesses we need to understand death
synchronization to understand how the
brain works and how in a novel and safe
way we can treat this is orders and
that&#39;s what I would like to explain to
you now let&#39;s have a look at brain
activity let&#39;s actually listen to it
it doesn&#39;t sound like Beethoven&#39;s fifth
but when I show it to you you see that
rhythmic structure what you&#39;re looking
at here is the recording of electric
activity in a human brain and you see it
has this temporal structure it has that
rhythm that is a brain rhythm now how
does such rhythm emerge in your brain
let me explain what you need to know is
that individual piece is within the
brain individual brain cells small
networks within the brain they all have
their own rhythm meaning they like to
exhibit this type of rhythmically
patterned electric activity and that&#39;s
what you see here in blue now the way
I&#39;ve drawn them here is that they&#39;re all
lined up in time they&#39;re all
synchronized and what we get when we
look at the emerging overall signal if
you will the sum of all these blue
pieces of activity you get the orange
you get a nice list structured rhythm
that is how these brain rhythms emerge
they emerge through the synchronization
through the shared timing of all the
individual bits and pieces of electric
activity in the brain and the
synchronization is fundamental for your
brain to be able to generate such
rhythms and I can show that to you if we
shift those individual pieces of
activity shown in blue in time relative
to each other and we again look at the
overall emerging picture the sum of all
of it what we see here in orange is what
we get namely nothing so you understand
how important it is for a different
piece of the brain to be on the same
clock to share time like the musicians
when they play Beethoven&#39;s fifth they
need to be synchronized for an overall
meaningful activity pattern to emerge
now the brain does not have a conductor
and what I mean with that there is no
signal no timing signal that helps
oldest different piece of the brain to
follow and beyond the same time it works
fundamentally different from your
orchestra in what you need to know is
that when we look at the brain in terms
of its structures one of its main
features are the gazillion of
connections between individual brain
cells the nerve fibers all these brain
cells they talk with each other they
talk with a lot a lot of other brain
cells and the same time they&#39;re also
receiving input or if you will listen to
a lot of other cells so now what you
have is not a central signal providing
the clock like the conductor in your
orchestra but rather you have this
self-organized behavior of all the
different pieces networks and individual
cells in the brain talking and listening
adjusting their own activity based on
the input they&#39;re receiving and together
they manage to synchronize and generate
those rhythms amazing now I want to
illustrate that and what I brought is
now two brain cells but two metronomes
those are old-fashioned mechanical
metronomes they go tick-tock tick-tock
they have their own rhythm they&#39;re set
both to go at the same frequency so you
can think of them as two brain cells
having their own rhythm and now we&#39;re
going to have them talk to each other so
how can two metronomes talk to each
other well I&#39;ve put them on a board that
can very easily move so as the metronome
goes tick-tock their mechanical motion
translates that board and which to
metronome set so that is the metronome
or the brain cell talking now what is
the listening in that process of self
emergent synchronization the listening
is that as the metronome is moving and
it stands on this moving platform and
that movement actually affects how the
metronome goes tick-tock let&#39;s look at
it
so you have to to metronomes
synchronized you see how the platform is
moving that is them in a self-organized
way talk with each other and figure out
how to gain beyond the same clock now it
took them off they&#39;re not talking with
each other anymore you see what happens
the communication link is broken think
of two brain areas or two brain cells
they can&#39;t properly listen and talk to
each other they cannot synchronize and
they cannot generate those all-important
electric rhythms those brain rhythms now
the reason why we&#39;re so interested in
synchronization is because there&#39;s a lot
of evidence that an impairment of the
brain in terms of its ability to
synchronize and generate this rhythm is
very tightly linked with mental illness
there&#39;s quite convincing evidence that
the inability to sufficiently
synchronize electric activity in
different parts of the brain is impaired
in disorders such as depression
schizophrenia autism ADHD perhaps
Alzheimer&#39;s and many others so by
understanding synchronization we
actually believe we start to understand
the biological mechanism of psychiatric
illness and we don&#39;t stop there
understanding the biological cause of
mental illness is obviously incredibly
important but how about if we use that
mechanism as a treatment target so
typically when we say target what we
mean is a specific receptor or a
specific molecule or we could design a
new drug that matches that receptor
that&#39;s not what I mean here what I&#39;m
talking about is using those electric
activity patterns as a target and
designing new interventions that helps
to restore and enhance that
synchronization and one way how we can
do that
is with non-invasive brain stimulation
specifically we call it transcranial
alternating current stimulation or TSEs
let me explain what you see here is that
we&#39;re attaching electrodes to the scalp
and this is not electroconvulsive
therapy we&#39;re using an incredibly weak
current an electric current that you can
barely feel and we pattern that electric
current into a meaningful waveform to
target this but in a frequency specific
way the synchronization that we want to
restore or enhance so we are not
overriding brain activity rather we&#39;re
just adding back in that conductor to
help restore and enhance that
synchronization so what you want to know
now is whether such a treatment really
treats those patients and we have
several clinical trials ongoing and I
don&#39;t get have the answer for you but I
want to show you why we&#39;re very hopeful
one example where brain synchronization
has been shown to be crucial is
creativity creativity is the ability to
generate something new and meaningful
based on your previous experiences and
your existing knowledge such an outcome
as a surprise that synchronization that
enables different parts of the brain
that store different aspects of your
knowledge and your previous experience
is absolutely crucial such that you can
combine all this into a new important
way so the question we ask if we use
this novel form of non-invasive brain
stimulation and enhance synchronization
can be actually out the creativity the
question you have now is is that really
a way to measure creativity in a
scientific way and the answer is
actually yes there&#39;s a test which is
like an IQ test but instead of measuring
intelligence
it measures creativity let me briefly
show you here&#39;s a test question you have
a little bit of time
please come up with a drawing including
that black line and the drawing should
be creative new meaningful and also add
a great title few seconds here is what
I&#39;ve probably done and you don&#39;t need to
stand up here to understand that this is
not very creative now let me show you
the response of one of the participants
our study here received a brain
stimulation same question very different
answer
now there are a lot of scientific ways
how to exactly assay creativity based on
these responses but I think the
principle is clear so what we&#39;ve done is
we&#39;ve borrowed a study design
essentially from clinical trials and we
performed a study where we evaluated
whether this novel form of brain
stimulation TAC s really can out their
creativity in comparison to a placebo or
sham stimulation and what we found is
that yes indeed we managed to
significantly and substantially enhance
creativity by targeting synchronization
now that is a study in healthy controls
and it&#39;s important to emphasize there&#39;s
still a lot of work we need to do until
we can establish such new interventions
as treatment for serious mental illness
but the reason why we&#39;re hopeful is
because the type of brain rhythm and
synchronization we targeted here is
exactly the same that we know is
impaired in patients for example with
depression so here is where we&#39;re going
with this we understand that
synchronization of brain activity is
absolutely vital not only for normal
brain function but also in terms of us
understanding it as a fundamental
mechanism that is impaired in
psychiatric illness so synchronization
of brain activity these brain rhythms
that emerge from that synchronization
for us we think of them as a treatment
target and we hope and they&#39;re currently
evaluating that through targeting
synchronization and restoring synchro&#39;s
ation
with non-invasive brain stimulation we
can provide relief to those so many
patients with mental illness that suffer
today because we don&#39;t yet have an
adequate treatment arsenal thank you
very much
