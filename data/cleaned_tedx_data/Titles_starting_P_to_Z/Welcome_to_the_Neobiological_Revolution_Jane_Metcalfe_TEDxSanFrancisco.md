there is a neo biological revolution
going on you may not be aware of this
but it&#39;s happening all around you and if
you don&#39;t believe me I can show you so
check this out how many of you have a
neural prosthetic device a cognitive
enhancing device a smartphone hello okay
raise your hands thank you okay how many
of you have an activity tracker hi can
you raise them higher yeah so one in
five Americans obviously this is Ted so
it&#39;s three quarters of you
is anybody here tracking their sleep a
lot Wow have you like me been able to
actually improve your sleep from
tracking it it&#39;s cool well okay not as
many as you&#39;re tracking but keep
tracking you can get there how many
people have done 23andme or ancestry.com
or one of those genealogy thinks right a
lot cool how many of you have sequenced
your microbiome the partnership with you
biome I would think it would be a much
larger percentage than the average
population which of course is tiny has
anyone here done whole genome sequencing
no okay so now I&#39;m gonna dive into a
little more personal questions if you
don&#39;t want to raise your hand I
understand just give me that look okay
how many of you have frozen your eggs
I&#39;m getting the egg I&#39;m getting the
looks I&#39;m getting some hands - okay and
I imagine that some of you in the
audience have frozen embryos right so my
point here is that we are assembling all
this information about ourselves that
we&#39;ve never had before and we&#39;re doing
this in ways that we can actually do
something with the information in a way
that we&#39;ve never been able to before and
it all starts here in 1953 we discover
the human source code in 2000 we learned
how to read that human source code in
2017 we&#39;re editing the human source code
so along with all these scientific
advances have come some you know
technological innovations like Oh for
instance the iPhone but also
accelerating computer capacity machine
learning imaging technologies sensors
all of these things combined are helping
us to see things that we&#39;ve never seen
before they&#39;re helping us to discover
biological circuits and systems that we
never knew existed
you know we&#39;re selling these huge data
sets we now have tools to deploy they&#39;re
allowing us to alter our bodies alter
our DNA alter even the shape and
structure and function of our brains
altering our very notions of ourselves
this is a neo biological revolution
humans season control of our own
evolution by inventing ideas and
technologies that redefine what it means
to be human
we started Wired magazine to cover the
digital revolution this is just the next
phase of the digital revolution and I
tell you the evidence is everywhere and
there&#39;s a lot to learn so dare to learn
I sequenced my genome I did a whole
genome sequence cost me a thousand
dollars I went to a company called
Veritas genetics and I just got my
results back they&#39;re really boring it&#39;s
fine I just wanted to contribute I mean
why did I do that because I&#39;m really
curious about me me me more information
about me please really interested I&#39;m
curious I wasn&#39;t afraid you know I&#39;ve
already had my children they&#39;re healthy
and strong and happy and smart and good
so I had no fears around any of that and
he also just wanted to contribute to
this extraordinary body of scientific
knowledge that we&#39;re accumulating right
now so dare to learn I recommend you do
it it&#39;s kind of an amazing journey
always ask there&#39;s a lot that we need to
understand about the science about the
technology about the ethics of what&#39;s
coming down the pike here so always ask
questions you know the good and the good
news here is that Americans are very
curious about this right one-third of
Americans act
we seek out scientific information
several times a week which is great you
think this is not a time for believing
in facts all these people are tracking
science this is great
guess which section of the New York
Times is most likely to be forwarded
op-eds you would think maybe business
stories mm-hmm science stories more
likely to be spread than any other I
think that&#39;s great so dare to learn dare
to ask but if you&#39;re scientist always
tell take the time to explain what
you&#39;re doing it&#39;s really important and
here&#39;s the good news
three-quarters of Americans believe that
scientists have the public interest at
heart we have confidence in our
scientists but I have to say your lousy
communicators you need to kind of up
your game as far as 21st century
communications tools are concerned
because you know viral viral headlines
screaming headlines and viral sound
bites are gonna smash your measured
response every time so I want to talk to
you about how technology is pushing
biology forward and what the impact on
human beings can be obviously what
immediately comes along with that topic
is a conversation about ethics and I
would love to do another talk another
day on the ethics but I can&#39;t do that
today because there&#39;s a lot of other
material that I want to get through but
believe me scientists all over the world
working with these human changing
population changing world and
environment changing technologies are
asking themselves these questions
they&#39;re having these conversations
ethics are clear and present every step
of the way but you know they&#39;re these
technologies are asking us to reconsider
what we value to reconsider what we
consider natural and to reconsider the
ethics and the morals so there&#39;s a
leading scientist you&#39;ve probably heard
of her name is Jennifer dude now she&#39;s
been the pioneer in CRISPR she&#39;s very
concerned about what happens with this
technology so she organized a conference
on Cal campus back in August so there I
am at CRISPR con
seriously there&#39;s DEFCON there&#39;s
comic-con now there&#39;s Chris perk on my
favorite panel had a pig farmer a
genetic scientist an ethicist a pastor
and a futurist I know this sounds like
the jug right the geneticist the pig
farm in the offices walk into the bar so
the ethicist says this is all happening
too fast
we can&#39;t wrap our heads around it
terrible things are gonna happen we need
to stop right here and right now and I&#39;m
thinking good luck with that honey
because the opportunities are so vast
and so extraordinary
you know CRISPR technologies are being
used to save lives right now they&#39;re
being used to feed people they&#39;re being
used to prevent genetically inherited
diseases they&#39;re being used to clean up
our environment and to help farmers so
this genie is out of the bottle and it
ate ever going back and even if you
wanted to stop it with moratoriums and
regulations all of which by the way are
in place
there&#39;s state-sponsored labs in China
that are doing right now 20 human CRISPR
trials and even if you&#39;re not talking
about state-sponsored labs in China
biohackers in your own backyard are not
paying attention to any of this there&#39;s
a guy named Josiah Zeno he&#39;s my favorite
local bio hacker he&#39;s got a company
called the Odin he&#39;ll sell you for $60 a
CRISPR startup kit bio hackers and
citizen scientists are pushing the stuff
and the frontiers forward just as much
as scientists in government and
industrial and academic labs this man oh
no father I actually not here at TEDx
San Francisco last year oh no has a rare
disorder called nf2 and it&#39;s a cancer
and he&#39;s growing tumors that are
attacking his hearing and could
eventually attack his eyesight as well
so he&#39;s highly motivated to ask and
learn and figure this stuff out and look
for solutions so he did what any
self-respecting San francisco-based
hacker entrepreneur would do he
sequenced his genome to 90,000
resolution that&#39;s a super super high
resolution
and he hosted a hackathon a genomic
hackathon in his case he happened to
have friends who were genetic scientists
and hackers and he happened to get it
hosted at Google so that was kind of
cool but it&#39;s kind of an extraordinary
thing and a representative of the
National Institutes of Health showed up
and it turns out this guy&#39;s job is to go
around to all the genomic hackathons
happening around the country to help
organize educate and learn and spread
the learnings that&#39;s kind of amazing you
know this could be what the future of
science and medicine looks like
biohackers citizen scientists it&#39;s kind
of an extraordinary thing so the NIH is
excited to encourage this kind of
entrepreneurship and and discovery
there&#39;s another government agency that
is noticeably less excited about it
that&#39;s the FDA so the FDA are not at all
excited about this consumer genomics
revolution right I mean they shut down
23andme from sharing a lot of this
information with us so the FDA is
worried that you can&#39;t be trusted with
your own genomic data you can&#39;t be
trusted because you don&#39;t know anything
this is complicated stuff don&#39;t worry
your pretty little heads about it
they&#39;re worried about false positives
they&#39;re worried that you&#39;ll get a false
positive that will lead you to do
something drastic some kind of
unnecessary surgery for instance they&#39;re
worried about false negatives that you
think I don&#39;t have the Alzheimer&#39;s genes
so I can keep smoking and drinking and
not exercising I&#39;ll never get
Alzheimer&#39;s this is the same mindset
that told us that home pregnancy testing
was a really bad idea that women would
be committing suicide all across the
country when they found out they were
pregnant yeah
so we can be afraid or we can just be
curious I&#39;m just really curious I think
this is the story of our times there&#39;s
so much out there happening that&#39;s just
mind-boggling stuff so
last week researchers published the
story about mosquitoes they have
genetically modified a mosquito that was
able to mate with a wild mosquito and
half offspring so that&#39;s excellent
right they can have the offspring the
offspring are not able to transmit
malaria dengue fever and possibly even
Zika we could be on the verge of
eradicating malaria it&#39;s kind of in a
miraculous time did you know that pigs
are actually going to be a platform for
generating human tissue and organs for
transplant this is happening and it&#39;s
happening faster than we imagined
imaging I mentioned that earlier brain
imaging is kind of in this amazing field
you know we&#39;re hoping to map the brain
we&#39;re hoping to see what&#39;s actually
happening in different parts of the
brain as we do things and learn how to
train our brains to do things better did
you know that your doctor may soon be
able to prescribe a video game for your
ADHD we&#39;re learning how to rewire our
brains there&#39;s a lot of fear there&#39;s a
lot of uncertainty there&#39;s a lot of
doubt there&#39;s a lot of disinformation
and it bounces around in the echo
chamber of social media and it&#39;s leading
to the tribal ization of our culture you
know there&#39;s one area where there&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s hard to imagine more misinformation
and that&#39;s in the area of food so we
screened a film last week called food
evolution I highly recommend it by the
way it&#39;s generating enormous controversy
not because it&#39;s it&#39;s good or bad but
because it&#39;s pro GMO and I want to show
you a clip from the film let me tell you
who this person is her name is Zen
Honeycutt and she founded an
organization called moms across America
and she is a nationally recognized
anti-gmo activist
so let me just show you how she thinks
frankly ice trust the social media like
vlogs like you know Bonnie hari&#39;s or
other moms that even just do a post I
trust what they say more than most
medical doctors more than the CDC more
than the FDA more than the USDA more
than the EPA that&#39;s real I don&#39;t need a
scientific study for that I don&#39;t need a
doctor to tell me that I just love this
Google search autism Monsanto crazy uh
you know apparently apparently she&#39;s and
her organization is being backed by
millions of dollars from the organic
food industry you know and I have
nothing against organic food I did a
stint as an organic chocolate
manufacturer I love organic food but I&#39;m
not afraid of GMO foods because I can
see what the opportunities are for
improving nutrients for protecting
farmers livelihoods by knocking out the
opportunity for disease to occur there&#39;s
extraordinary opportunities here but
there&#39;s a huge amount of disinformation
you guys heard of the non-gmo project so
this is a this is an organization that
has been encouraging food manufacturers
to put a non-gmo food label on their
packaging sounds great right except that
when you walk down the aisle of the
grocery store there&#39;s so many of those
labels that you go well that&#39;s not
labeled non-gmo there must be GMOs in
there and it gives you the sense the GMO
food is everywhere
I mean sure corn yeah we all know about
that sugar beets right we know that
there are certain crops soya beans there
more than 90% GMO but the vast majority
of foods are not okay you know their GMO
papayas because otherwise the rainbow
papaya crop would have been wiped out
there are GMO bananas because otherwise
banana blight would have wiped out not
only the banana crops but all the
farmers in Africa whose farms are being
destroyed by banana blight but the
non-gmo food project would lead you to
believe that this stuff is everywhere
you know hunt tomato says no GMO foods
and our Tomatoes there are no GMO
Tomatoes there&#39;s no GMO orange juice
there&#39;s no GMO milk
there&#39;s no GMO yogurt Dannon yogurt says
no GMOs you know we&#39;re safe here&#39;s my
personal favorite salt no GMOs in our
saw
it&#39;s a mineral but that&#39;s where we are
right now that&#39;s what we have to deal
with fear uncertainty and doubt you know
you have to learn you have to dare to
know you have to dare to learn and you
have to dare to change your mind you
know which the last time you changed
your mind
I want to believe organic food is good
and GMO food is bad but guess what
that&#39;s not what the research is telling
us dare to change your mind you know
there&#39;s a company called man they
packaged lettuce and they wanted to
export their lettuce to Canada and the
Canadian said you&#39;ve got this non GMO
thing on your package and they said yeah
I said well there is no non GMO lettuce
and they&#39;re like yeah well whatever it&#39;s
good it&#39;s reassuring to consumers and
they said sorry we&#39;re not importing that
into Canada because that&#39;s
disinformation that&#39;s spreading fear so
the man company went back and so okay so
why do we have this on the package I
mean they&#39;re right we don&#39;t need it so
they&#39;re taking it off and you may start
to see that you know the same time
you&#39;re seeing companies getting clear
about that you see headlines about other
companies going racing to put that
non-gmo label on their foods you know
this stuff is complicated it&#39;s changing
really fast
I mean nutrition in particular is
particularly confident complicated but
you know you got to be able to learn you
got to be able to change your mind you
know who else changed their mind
recently on this topic the science guy
Bill Nye he said he had to change a
chapter in his book he did not realized
that sequencing was happening 10 million
times faster and more accurately than he
thought so he&#39;s changing his mind things
are changing rapidly the science is
coming out is so fast and so furious and
it&#39;s really hard to understand at all
but I&#39;m really committed to that I&#39;m
really interested in trying to
understand where we&#39;re going
what kind of species are we designing
when we started wired my partner said
the digital revolution
is whipping ripping through our lives
like a Bengali typhoon well let me tell
you this neo biological revolution is
heading us straight for the white water
we&#39;re going into the rapids we&#39;re gonna
get wet we&#39;re gonna get scared we may
flip our boat but I got to tell you bio
is the new digital so I hope you want to
get onboard this ride I hope you are
curious more than scared and I hope you
want to help us figure out what the
future of our species looks like because
guess what your kids are already there
[Music]
thank you
