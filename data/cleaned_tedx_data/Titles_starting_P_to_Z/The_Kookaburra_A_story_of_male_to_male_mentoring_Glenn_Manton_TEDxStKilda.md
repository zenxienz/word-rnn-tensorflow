my name&#39;s Glen Manson and I would like
to take you back to 1993
it&#39;s the MCT grand final day there&#39;s the
MCG not to scale it&#39;s the last Sunday in
September and two huge combatants Esalen
versus captain face off in a race
towards the Premiership Cup every boy&#39;s
dream to touch that Cup to wear that
Premiership medallion around their neck
and I&#39;m just like you I&#39;m stuck in a
world of sadness understand I&#39;m not
competing on night out on the ground I&#39;m
injured I&#39;m prone I&#39;m remorseful
and I&#39;m a bitter twisted 20 year old
brats who does represent the S&amp;M
Football Club as a professional
footballer but on this day just once it
all for himself
he wants to touch that Cup he wants to
wear that medal around his neck I&#39;m a
picture and for disappointed with the
world in Essendon win I don&#39;t get a
medal if couch and when I don&#39;t get a
medal blendin gets nothing
man the halftime siren sounds and I&#39;m
stuck in my seat kicking around fresh
wondering if the day could get any worse
when out of nowhere a thick meaty hand
falls upon my shoulder and I look up and
it&#39;s an old guy someone over the age of
30 and this old guy says to me you&#39;re a
damn good football and before I could
get my chest to stop swelling and return
fire he said to me but you&#39;re not that
[Music]
if I&#39;m good
I couldn&#39;t leave this the days going
from bad to worse his old man&#39;s a
costing me in the stands and now he
pulls out a pen and a piece of paper and
he writes his note and as only old
people can do he folds into some sort of
origami crane and he hands it to me and
I unwrap it and it says for kookaburra
and a phone number I&#39;ll look at this
strange man he says call me if you want
to be a better football and a bit of
person before I could say anything he
was gone I take the piece of paper I&#39;m
pretty much I could pocket the game ends
the final sorry SN the baby bombers have
taken out the game and Glenn Manson
returns to 300 maybe stretch that&#39;s more
you can google map that my family home
trudges eight steps up into the back
door opening to the left into the
kitchen facing one on the dad we have
apprenticeship metal or touching the cup
my dad&#39;s excited the whole season
participating in even a remote sense and
he says to me throwing the table to the
side and pushing his chair out to the
middle of the kitchen he says hey hey
how was your day as parents - I said dad
it was terrible it was horrible worst
day in my life I didn&#39;t get a
premiership medal I didn&#39;t touch the cup
I&#39;m a professional football sans any
reward in fact I was even insulted by an
old man called the Kookaburra who gave
me his phone number and said call me if
I wanted to become a better football
and a better person my dad lost it he
said you rent the cookware is I&#39;m hit
the cooker Bracy you know the cookware I
said well I just met the Gerber he said
what is the cook Roger I&#39;ll defuse that
you know the Kookaburra yes he says the
Kookaburra is a legend of a AFL football
his name is Alec Epis hundred 80 games
four Grand Finals superstar if he told
you to call him you must call him I turn
to my mother for a sec
in opinion she was just stirring soup on
the stove and without even looking back
when I asked him um should I call this
man the Kookaburra or not she simply
said I only call him if he has patience
so I did something that many people here
have never done I went out to the
landing of my home and I picked up a
landline and I dialed the number for the
Kookaburra it took a long time finally
getting through I sent alistair cooke of
our a fluffy man birdie friend&#39;s
feathery guy and with Glen mountain we
met at the football today and he
interrupted me straightaway and he said
this coming Wednesday meet me at the
bottom of Park Street Clarinda reserve

in Rooney ponds at 7:00 a.m. don&#39;t be
late I tried to say something back but
he hung up that Wednesday came around
very very quickly and I arrived at the
bottom of Park Street Clarinda reserved
Moonee ponds at quarter past seven and I
strolled down with swag before swag was
invented and this man barrel-chested
burly soared all Italian with a football
unresolvable and against the Willie beam
and I had no idea that he was furious
foolishly I stepped into his tractor
beam and he drew me in closer and closer
where he unleashed an unbelievable
verbal tirade every curse word known to
mankind wrapped into one perfectly
succinct sentence and he said to me with
a slight Italian accent if you&#39;re ever
late again never never come back I
thought that&#39;s fine
this guy&#39;s a psycho
I don&#39;t want to come back two hours
later I pulled myself to my vehicle made
my way home and said goodbye forever to
the Kookaburra alligators I never wanted
to see this man again I could barely
walk one-on-one he punished me football
training AFL skills I hated every second
but something strange happened and I&#39;m
not sure what it was to this day I&#39;m not
entirely sure I actually turned up the

next week at 7:00 a.m. to the bottom of
Park Street florinda reserve many ponds
and I met Alec Epis the Kookaburra for a
second time and he flogged me again and
I couldn&#39;t walk again and I promised
myself I wouldn&#39;t go back again but I
went back a third time and a fourth a
fifth sixth each time at 7 a.m. to the
bottom of Park Street Moonee ponds flew
into reserve every Wednesday morning for
the next nine years we never missed a
Wednesday morning five years into our
relationship I decided as any young man
would do that I needed to give this man
Alec Epis the Kookaburra a gift for his
male to male mentoring his affection his
trust his time through all the good for
all the bad the highs the lows my entire
football career he was the one constant
he was always there so I searched
Melbourne this great town that we live
in for a gift that I could engrave the
height of male to male bonding when you
can engrave something
but I found nothing I couldn&#39;t find the
gift feeling for this man
so I turned up at his home on Park
Street many ponds sands gift sands metal
sands gift I knocked on his front door
he opened that big presence and invited
me into his home I had nothing to give
him the whole plan was to be there to
give him something I had nothing he
invited me to the kitchen where he
returned to carefully skillfully cutting
homemade salami Italian tradition and I
stood in the door jambs nervous bumping
my microphone uneasily causing the sound
take a few dramas and why was he there
but standing in the door jamb I posted I
tried to pick my moment and I said to
him cooker there&#39;s something I want to
say to you
he continued to cunt he said what&#39;s that
I said look I love them I&#39;ve wanted to
come here today with a gift but off I&#39;ve
come with nothing except on something I
just really want to say what&#39;s that I
just want to tell you that I I love you
at which point the knife stopped he
looked back over his head he resumed his
cadence and he said I love you to a man
who has given me everything he deserves
so much more feeling great gift a man
who I love ladies and gentlemen thank
you so much in case you&#39;re wondering did
I ever go on to win a premiership medal
yes I did do I still see the Kookaburra
yes I do and where is all this fit into
fake or fate well I&#39;d like to think that
when live speak thick meaty hand Italian
or otherwise lands on your shoulder and
then all of a sudden reaches out you see
that as a moment of fate and you take it
[Applause]
[Music]
you
