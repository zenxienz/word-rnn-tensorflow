my name is Omar and I want to show you
this newspaper clipping this isn&#39;t just
any newspaper clipping it&#39;s equipment
from an Egyptian newspaper called Aleph
nomads which is Arabic for the pyramids
this clipping came from a newspaper that
came out on January 17 1945 the exact
day that the first Egyptian revolution
occurred during this summer my travel to
Egypt to see my grandma and grandma they
had a bunch of support will Scott&#39;s in
the basement from airline tickets going
from Orlando to Cairo to bank statements
to even my grandfather&#39;s American
citizenship flight the first unit in the
heart course I take us who was collage
and were supposed to collect pieces of
paper with interesting textures for
preparation so discovering the whole
dusty boxes in my parents basement in
Cairo was America luckily they let me
take whatever I wanted so I went through
the bottles went through the classic
paper that broke away from the crumbling
boxes scavenging and hunting for
anything and everything grainy and I
found this newspaper clipping
it&#39;s so cool to home because in a sense
I own part of Egyptian history not only
that but a quick search on ebay Rivia
that similar newspapers from the 40s are
perfect good amount of money right now I
learned something pretty valuable
personally and monetary now what if I
told you that this newspaper actually
came from admission this is here it
could be actually came from an issue
that came up last month and you can take
this many
for free what if I told you that this
newspaper clippings headline actually
translates to ten bonus of downtown that
you&#39;ve never seen before what if I told
you that this newspaper clipping has no
relationships to Egyptian revolution
whatsoever and as a matter of fact the
Egyptian revolution didn&#39;t occur on
January 17 1945 it happened during July
1952 well if I told you that the only
reason I decided to say came out of
January 17 is because my birthday&#39;s on
the same day and I thought that the year
1945 sounded more of you what if I told
you that this epiphany didn&#39;t come from
my grandparents basement IRA because
they don&#39;t have a basement and their
house entire which I didn&#39;t visit this
year because they don&#39;t have a house
entire in the first place what if I told
you that this newspaper clipping if it
did come from a newspaper in the forties
would be worth only $5.99 but if I told
you I&#39;m not for Egypt I&#39;m just kidding I
know everybody Egyptian doesn&#39;t make you
too mature talking of the stuff which is
why it is automatically decided to trust
me more specifically why do people trust
strangers and what does that mean for us
as a society from such an early age my
mother&#39;s taught me about stranger danger
and nature I understood it and
understood to never talk to it to a guy
in a white van asking me if I want a
candy but how come in the last
stereotypical idea when a stranger is do
you not only believe them that we trust
in a trust that they say for example
when you&#39;re lost in the middle of
nowhere
no not online or physical and you&#39;re in
your car with nowhere to go
who do you turn to random people pastor
by vocalist and strangers the thing is
we know nothing about them they could be
bad people
for some reason we trust them we trust
Amina to listen to what they&#39;ve got to
say regarding how to get to a certain
destination which there&#39;s a chance they
have no clue about we trust them and we
trust the directions they&#39;re giving us
even though they might make even more of
us why do we trust strangers what are
the kids but my Nana just changes when
we&#39;ve been specifically been talking
about you and one of the time we trust
strangers more than an actual friend
sometimes going back to ebay how do you
know that the seller you&#39;re buying that
vintage for these newspaper front is
actually going to sell it to you how do
you know that you might not receive
anything in your mailbox after you could
charge on your credit card
eBay runs completely on trust in 2014
the American Psychological Association
carried out a study and a part of that
study involves a bunch of behavioral
tests on students from Cornell
University and Kevon University in
Germany one of these tests is what they
call the trust game in which strangers
are given the champ in which
participants are given the chance to
give five dollars to a complete stranger
if they do give the five dollars instead
for truth is equal twenty dollars to the
stranger now has twenty dollars this
stranger now has a choice here she can
give back ten dollars to the original
participant or keep this book twenty for
themselves
fifty four percent of the participants
said that they would give the five
dollars trusting that the stranger would
share and give ten back and not keep the
quotes money for themselves this
excessive an obsessive amount of trust
might seem dangerous which is got these
fullness of set dressing statuses I&#39;d
say yet it also makes our society much
stronger than it would be without
without trust unknowingly our
communities how big or how small are
pretty powerful with a substantial both
from the currently occurring in
communities all over the world those
same communities are solid and members
of those communities are well-connected
shown by her irrational of sometimes
beneficial sense of trust this
underlying foundation has been
recognized by several businesses and as
a result there&#39;s a bunch of different
services being created on the basis of
trust I already talked about eBay but
Airbnb works the same way in which
strangers rely on other strangers for a
home when considering the number of
rooms of hotel Hotel offers Airbnb
offers the highest amount 6 million and
therefore can be thought of as the
largest hotel chain in the entire world
that&#39;s 6 million 6 million rooms and a
30 million dollar company whereas all
dependent on the trusted stranger the
same applies to other businesses who
realized that trust a highly prevalent
system of rents and societies all over
the world and they&#39;ve used this to their
advantage
obviously a system isn&#39;t good for below
the time it can be dangerous to trust
strangers in fact logic as McGee aware
is in fact one in five Americans
believed that they wouldn&#39;t necessarily
trust strangers however what we believe
isn&#39;t necessarily reflected in the way
we act a lot of the time if you have
trust in the air whether dangerous or
not there&#39;s become weather dangerous or
not and this lets us know that somehow
must some type of level we have a firm
Society businesses have acknowledged
this and acted upon this and has the
result the cycle continues and we trust
strangers even more so when you may
decide to have kids one day or you&#39;re
ready to have kids talk to them about
stranger danger and I trust strangers
but don&#39;t expect them to actually listen
we didn&#39;t listen every day for the
better for the worse we trust strangers
and it&#39;s become part of our lives
whether we like it or not thank you
