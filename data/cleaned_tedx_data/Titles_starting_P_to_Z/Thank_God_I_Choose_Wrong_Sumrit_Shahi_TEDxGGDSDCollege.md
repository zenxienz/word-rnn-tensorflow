good afternoon everyone foremost Thank
You TEDx and as we college I have a
personal affiliation to wealthy college
interestingly enough my grandfather I
come from a family of builders which
undergirds so my grandfather was
involved in the building of this College
my father went ahead and did his
graduation from this very College my
sister went ahead and did her graduation
and post-graduation from the very cause
it and I did not get in this little so
thank you for finally letting the entire
auditorium on the other side of the dice
and I think that&#39;s worked enough well
for me and that is exactly what my topic
for the day is it&#39;s about the choices
that has made and thank God I chose the
wrong let&#39;s talk about choices there are
two types of choices that we have in
life one that affion the control that
means the family that we are born into
sometimes the relationships that you get
into things that you do not have control
on the religion that you were born into
and then you get it see see other
choices are the one that you think you
think but other than to be shaped by
society around you your career your
friends how good your life goals and
these the choices that I think we end up
the leading to be taken in the right to
fit it but an awesome taken in the wrong
term and that is exactly what I am going
to be talking about I am going to be
playing a little game with you we go to
the next
oh yeah so that little game that I want
to play with you guys
the games are called what is the oil I&#39;m
going to give you clues about certain
people that you had ready well first off
in life but do not know just like real
choices that made them into who they
have become today so Kenya Kansas person
Devon
living on government aid could barely
afford to feed her baby did not even
have a computer turned out to be one of
the highest ed selling authors in the
world right now
JK Dover this man born into a poor
family with nine siblings worked at a
chemist Rob slept on the vote in the
treatment but made a choice in life that
wasn&#39;t technically degrees today we know
him as one of the most celebrated actors
in the country
a wick term of sexual abuse deliver the
baby at 14 yet finished 33 and started
abuse jack copra and can you get this
versus that earth
Cameron spoon with goodies food as well
at 21 got a spinal cord injury and the
doctor told him never to dance again
the screen for the conventional joints
that he would have bleep him would have
made him sit at home and not become who
yesterday straight across them porn with
his legs alive he could not walk to the
time he was searched
he only dream in life was something that
involves mobility he started his career
at the fat side of his household with
his mother
today&#39;s the guys investigated chefs
began haha what is common and all these
people if what I want to bring my point
three perhaps of this something more
than this is their life and they made
the wrong choice now when I see the
wrong choices let me clarify what the
right choice according to society is the
right choice is also to create joy
Gurukul get a good degree in college he
can flip-flop and obviously in India if
you&#39;re not a doctor an engineer or a
proper MBA you&#39;re repetitive so the only
way you can go beyond this and follow
your passion or your heart if when you
make the wrong choice but believe in
itself and that is exactly what I&#39;ve
done so I&#39;m going to be taking you from
my own journey to tell you about how I
need all the wrong choices and resulted
he enters a college which denied
readmission the very first place to be
standing on the diet so thank God I
chose the door how it all began the
first step or the first mistake that I
took was great temp ended and I had
caught a decent percentage in school
which would have gotten me into a good
food ethnicity but I want to do
something systems I wanted to ID now I
he was a system of education that wasn&#39;t
very well versed with the people of
thundergirl patented so I joined the
hotel in there is one certain things
happened in that hostel which involves
certain green matters which are
available in the hills which
have grid and I got kicked out of that
one step nothing to be proud of honest
there was a mistake that I did and I had
two choices once I came back home he I
did not have a school to go to
despite getting up there he has the
temptation to attend please kicked out
of a hostel in grade 11 had no school to
go to parents back at home who did not
understand where they went wrong and you
know how it is in Punjab right it&#39;s not
your parents who come and question your
ability since the relatives who come and
have artists again at your own very
expense sitting on your dinner table I&#39;m
questioning your parents and yourselves
I think that I tell them is not
questioning your husband and I&#39;m like
yes ma&#39;am miroku&#39;s no such things went
very well take that art scene often
Columbia but that is not happen so
complete theatre has nowhere to go to
and the only thing that I&#39;d like
advocate and it&#39;s something you threw
out it was my journey cool and one third
was eating so naturally I thought why
not you&#39;re writing a short I started
writing a book important words that
featured word local these three words I
police have determined everyone&#39;s life
choices for a really really long time
and we might not say it out loud but
subconsciously these are the words that
affect us and to be honest there is
nothing wrong with it because we live in
a society at the end of the day but at
the same time when you live in a society
you also live to yourself and that is
exactly what I did I feel we all do now
what next
so easier way of who obviously puts the
blame on someone as I could have said I
was involved in the wrong company
hence it is wrong when sniffling and got
kicked out of was dead so the reality
was I did a mistake and I had to take
onus of it but what about tetanus tea
and there&#39;s a thing about mystique in
hindsight if you realize the greater the
mistake you do the more opportunity to
learn from it that is something that we
often tend to ignore but that is exactly
what it poses so I came back home no
school to go to and my parents to be
honest my mom&#39;s right here in the
audience parents to be honest this or
that hey I did not tell them that I was
writing the book I would stay up through
the night life come back have a snack in
the kitchen and my mother still thought
that I was on drugs
because these are my munchies because I
remember he telling my father to come
ahead and have a little man-to-man
conversation with me about the fact of
being awake indeed at night and what I
was giving to us to do so I remember 7th
July 2011 is when I got kicked out of my
horse dead and 9 July 2012 I had the
first book in hand and that is when they
realized what I was doing for that one
year and that is when I realized that
one choice that I could have made the
same choice put has been to stay back at
home believe it - what they said so up
to join a school not I didn&#39;t go to
school for a year
I continued writing secretly went to
Teddy got published without their
knowledge at all some PT and wisest
choice
I became an author accidentally so wrote
my Teddy novel at 17 the funny thing is
the same auntie who was verging on my
parents money in Sparta stricken and
making my life hell was the first one to
stand as a book launch and proclaim that
because I&#39;ll fight this case to do best
in his life so welcome to real life were
people so books kept on happening so the
first book at 17 and this for someone
who had never been part of the school
editorial board never gotten published
in newspapers or a magazine and a direct
book word of mouth spread and the book
became a best-seller selling 1 lakh
copies in the first few months with them
and then obviously I discovered
accidentally what my wrong choice led to
which were other books my passion for
writing and then I wrote to mobile which
evolved in death and that&#39;s a fancy
picture with no writer users are
affected so the second wrong choice now
always good in the hood who had finally
ended vehicles had finished I again for
a decent percentage obviously not good
enough of this very for this but joke
survived but at the same time I had a
big question in my mind now I being the
only son of a traditional business
family from the city had one option
those letters never selected for a
single son which is to join the family
this is the home now to join the
family business essentially meant that I
did a business degree and continued the
line of finger builder which clearly was
in my bathroom and my passion lien
sensitive was the fact that I wanted to
become a writer
so taking mistake that I did was to a
liberal arts college in Pune with
primary details today I think collective
unity relatives in my entire extended
family understand for them just
continues to be a performing arts
college where I probably don&#39;t doing it
again tantric which nearly looking at me
they must have realized for the wheel at
all so the third wrong choice so I
started to plot or in father&#39;s in Pune
and taking her into college I got one
random possible production house in
Mumbai he things that they wanted me to
come in love a little right out of the
TV show them taking urine for this Unni
chillin life is going good two books at
wink when I had a huge dilemma in my
mind do I continue and go ahead with
what I&#39;m doing his life in put I still
made my choices and has put enough free
in popularity and life is good in Pune
is good in college or do I tease another
death or do I go ahead and do ventures
into the on load so I left college and
end up at Mumbai 20 all by myself
convincing my parents to give me one
more chance I&#39;m living one padlock of
which every both of us over here to but
I did it for the right reasons
performing for my wrong so I so I
started writing TV for Channel V I was a
showgirl slaughterhouse
which is extremely well and continued
for two years and then one show led onto
the others and as of today as written
for ten television shows over thirteen
hundred episodes and around one and a
half years of programming television all
of this simply because at 17 I&#39;d made a
mistake and it was to own up to it and
it led me to sue something that wasn&#39;t
intentional which was wrong in terms of
the society but I studies it what
instancing he also happened where I was
writing my television shows was that I
got nominated for my very first Ostara
ha convenient area was I
that time I was 20 and indeed I&#39;m the
youngest nominee in the best loli
category or throughout 20 years there
was up in there a jet to another cool
thing and I don&#39;t even like all these
accolades because these are the only
sanctions of you realizing that you know
you can go astray in life from the
convention but then that Pecos
recognizing it st 30 under 30 happened
last two last year and this was a very
special award for me because this around
the same time I lost my father this was
a lot award that he saw me getting I
will a young achiever and that is when I
realized you know I had I not taken that
single step of going away from this
invention and choosing what my passions
will be lame my father would have gone
an uncertain man and that journey itself
made me realize that importance or what
it means to follow your heart and follow
your path so that physically get me to a
very important question who are you
you know everyone keeps talking about
following your heart causing your
passion and trying to be different but
the problem with us is that it&#39;s not
important to be christened important to
be learned from to yourself enjoy circle
how many of you remember the Maslow&#39;s
hierarchy of needs your lack of transfer
school yeah yeah nobody understood it I
don&#39;t till today
reality doesn&#39;t change but it&#39;s a very
technically fierce introduce it man who
has variety of NEPA tells us essentially
that we need to satiate all these needs
in our life to achieve an optimum ball
and most of the choices that we make I
feel from these knees now click on
please he needs another second devil
that is where our evolution stops more
often than not and that is exactly why
we don&#39;t go ahead and fulfill opposites
exactly my point
hence it is so boring to be added and it
is so boring to be right all the time
and what&#39;s with this world world faster
I&#39;m going to quickly wrap up my talk by
defining fashion for all of the people
fasten according to me is not simply
something that you could even faster
integrity is something that you don&#39;t
even have to formally be fooled it you
learn it on by yourself become bloody
good at it and have become so good at it
that you can go ahead and teach it to
someone
that is your to pattern and that is
something everyone to inside create and
cultivate in their life because receive
you me a true passion will take you
through a long journey and I started
working for insider since I&#39;ve been
working mostly we&#39;ll finish college soon
you do not want a job in your life where
you&#39;re wondering every Friday why
wouldn&#39;t Monday come again and every
Monday waiting outside a dosa and that
is exactly how we purge in your life
thank you guys
