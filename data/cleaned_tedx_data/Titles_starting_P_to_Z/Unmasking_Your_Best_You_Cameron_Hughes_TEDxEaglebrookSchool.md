come on I can&#39;t breathe this or any
oxygen here so here&#39;s my idea for a TED
talk I believe we should all get up and
down dance and random places and throw
t-shirts thank you good night
is anyone here going through life feel
like they&#39;re living like someone else
then maybe they&#39;re just not living their
true self it&#39;s sometimes they have a
mask on but you just don&#39;t know how to
get rid of it I know I live like that
and I felt my true potential was being
stifled by this concept of fear
rejection and other people&#39;s
expectations and everything in between
but the power of unmasking yourself of
just getting up and doing whatever it is
you want and not caring who&#39;s watching
is when a life really happens trust me
because it happened to me when I was a
kid I tried out for all the sports teams
didn&#39;t make any of them hold your tears
and the schoolyard
I was always last pick at the tennis
club
all I ever won was the sportsmanship
award nobody wants to win the damn
horsemanship award okay I would go home
to my mom and I&#39;d whine oh my god I&#39;m so
dejected I can&#39;t believe this and mom
would say trust me there&#39;s other ways
you can contribute to the team
and they didn&#39;t quite understand it at
the time but those were really profound
words that would change my life you know
when I was 14 came home from school one
day mom said to me my sister can you
come sit in the living room my sister
are thinking yes
we&#39;re finally getting the puppy right
she says have a seat
so we sit down she holds her hand tells
us she&#39;s just been diagnosed with breast
cancer but don&#39;t worry about it guys I&#39;m
gonna beat this I&#39;m gonna fight this and
my mom said just keep living just keep
loving just keep going on with things
then my mom neither did she ever fight
that two years later my mother lost her
battle to cancer 16 I was alone I was
scared I didn&#39;t know what to do next and
as you can probably tell I was a mama&#39;s
boy but I had to get things back
together I had to figure out a way to
move on a couple months later I went
back to school this new attitude I
figured I&#39;m gonna try out for the
basketball team yet again but this time
I&#39;m gonna shave my legs to see if I can
be a little more aerodynamic guys never
do that
it&#39;s even work my buddy Jay and I we try
out for the team we go to see if our
names on the gym board and Jay screams
with joy yes he made it and I&#39;m like oh
didn&#39;t make another team again I was 6
feet tall how could I not make it how
much talent do I not have right but it
was funny because in that moment I
wasn&#39;t as upset as I used to be when I
was facing all the other rejection I&#39;m
thinking how important it was to make
the sports team you see when the worst
thing that happens to you in your life
happens to you you just kind of blow it
off whatever you got nothing to lose so
a couple weeks later I surprised Jay and
the rest of the basketball team at an
away game I painted my face I put
overalls on and I showed up and cheered
like an absolute lunatic I knew it was
working because the away fans
wanted to kill me and the guys in my
team were like I think I like it took
them a little while and then at
university my buddy said hey should do
something different at the football
games so one Saturday morning before the
big game I go to the grocery store and I
buy the largest watermelon you&#39;ve ever
seen in your life I carve it out put it
on my big beautiful noggin I paint my
face purple I put on a cape and I put
purple leotards on because that&#39;s what
and I had addy in a fence and I became
known as melon head and then I needed a
job that summer so I became the mascot
for my local baseball team yes folks I
was Lenny the Lynx and I&#39;m telling you
that Lynx head was the largest thing
you&#39;ve ever seen in your life you could
barely go anywhere with this thing
you&#39;re starting to see a pattern of why
I was single for so long I get it hurts
but something somebody wasn&#39;t quite
right you know I I was wearing these
masks and I wasn&#39;t totally connecting
with people the way I thought I could
and the way I thought I should so fast
forward to a couple years later but an
Ottawa Senators NHL hockey game in my
hometown with a buddy of mine and
there&#39;s no excitement in the arena
there&#39;s dissipation it&#39;s just dead quiet
and I&#39;m really upset and we&#39;re sitting
there and I&#39;m like I&#39;ve got they&#39;d watch
this and he goes please don&#39;t please
don&#39;t it was too late just suddenly the
song comes on and I get up on my chair
and I&#39;m dancing and I&#39;m dancing and I&#39;m
just going absolutely nuts and the
crowds looking at me like you are right
now
like this guy&#39;s possessed get some
medical health but in that moment in
your life or whatever that might be for
you where you just decide to get up and
go for it you&#39;ve got to keep dancing
because I just kept dancing I just kept
dancing I just kept dancing and suddenly
the craziest thing happened the entire
arena went absolutely nuts
and everyone&#39;s going crazy I sit back
down to my seat my buddy is long gone at
this point we haven&#39;t spoken since and
I&#39;m sitting there I&#39;m thinking oh my god
what did I just do and then it hit me
totally hit me I finally took off my
mask I finally just decided to be me but
the real me and in that moment in your
life where you cheer yourself on and you
cheer yourself to try things it&#39;s
incredible what will happen in your
community and how people will support
you it&#39;s pretty incredible and I
challenge everyone in this room to have
that moment where you&#39;re like you know
what enough of it I&#39;m just going to take
my mask off and I&#39;m just going to go for
it because when that happens that&#39;s when
life&#39;s magic begins my friends that&#39;s
when it begins and your whole community
will embrace you it is unbelievable
back to the game adrenaline is rushing
through my body I have no idea what&#39;s
happening the craziest thing happened
whistle stop whistle blows play stops
next thing I know 10,500 people turn
around me and look at me they&#39;re like
come on big red white boy let&#39;s dance
and I&#39;m thinking to myself I should have
gone with my buddy but I had to embrace
it so I get up from my seat and ten
thousand finer people like what&#39;s he
gonna do and I had no idea so I should
pull over and I go to the aisle and I
start by the way I&#39;m completely sober
this entire time I swear and I&#39;m up
there and I&#39;m dancing and I&#39;m going
crazy and I&#39;m going crazy but what&#39;s
crazy now is ten thousand five hundred
people are cheering they&#39;re going nuts
they&#39;re high-fiving me the place is
going off 20 seconds later the team
scores the play stops I&#39;ll go back to my
seat someone from the Senators came up
to me I thought they&#39;re gonna like make
a citizen&#39;s arrest or something by
behavior Cameron no they just wanted my
information to maybe bring me back some
day to come and get crazy again
am i okay the next day I go to my what I
thought as a Canadian kid was my dream
job working at a local rink for $7.00 an
hour
and I&#39;m sitting there I get the
newspaper and the front page of the
newspaper says dancing redhead bandits
still show at Senators game I&#39;m like oh
my god I think that&#39;s me and all I can
think about was how do I explain this to
my dad tonight but in that moment my
mother&#39;s words rang so true to me
there&#39;s other ways you can contribute to
the team but in that moment I finally
just took off my mask
that&#39;s what she was saying to me just be
yourself you know when you&#39;re going
through what she went through and she
learned so much but ultimately what she
was saying is just be yourself and
that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about
not being afraid because contributing to
the team isn&#39;t isn&#39;t what it&#39;s always
all about it&#39;s finding ways that you can
contribute to make embrace your talents
that make you well your uniqueness
allows your uniqueness to shine that&#39;s
what it&#39;s all about and that&#39;s what my
mom was saying to me it was crazy
I loved it was shocking and I tell
people there&#39;s no way I would have had
this career how&#39;d I not got up a second
time there&#39;s no way because had I not
got up the second time I&#39;m sure I
wouldn&#39;t have had a career performing at
1400 sporting events for teams like the
Cleveland Cavaliers the New York Knicks
Montreal Canadiens ambit&#39;s and orders
Bakersfield Condors for over 18 million
people live in ten countries in 40
states and nine provinces and have only
been hospitalized eight times that&#39;s not
bad
so what if the crowd hadn&#39;t cheered me
on that night when I got up and went for
it where would I be
I probably wouldn&#39;t be here or Willa
what I&#39;ve kept going what I found other
ways to get up have you ever gotten up
and it just didn&#39;t quite work the way
you thought you&#39;re like ah I&#39;m not gonna
get up again I&#39;m just gonna run home and
hide what do you do because all of us
had this voice in our head don&#39;t we we
have this voice in her head should I
shouldn&#39;t I oh my god there&#39;s this girl
I&#39;m gonna embarrass her she&#39;s not gonna
like me oh my god I&#39;m never gonna go out
with anyone I may be single the rest of
my life oh my god one of my friends
gonna think oh my god my friends gonna
think I&#39;m so crazy oh maybe they don&#39;t
like me maybe I&#39;ll get new friends oh my
god my parents will
oh my god what should i do should I get
up said I got you want you do you just
get up right it&#39;s just so much easier in
that moment in your life where you just
get up what happens is pretty amazing
what happened to me that night that
community won&#39;t embrace you because
you&#39;re taking chances you&#39;re taking
risks as hard as it might be and I
challenge you to surround yourself like
you do here with coaches and mentors and
people they&#39;re going to help you out and
friends that are close to you and
advisers because those that adversity
and those challenges in your life it&#39;s
going to happen it&#39;s just part of life
trust me and that rejection trust me for
every game that I get hired to there&#39;s
probably five teams that say no but I
celebrate that victory when someone
believes in me do you keep going you
know when might when I started to do
this I told my dad and my dad&#39;s like oh
no you&#39;re not but yeah I hate him I had
to had to figure out a way and it was
really hard my dad wanted me to get a
job I said dad I&#39;m not qualified to do
anything I&#39;ve got a dance and eventually
my dad picked up on it and believed in
me which was pretty cool and then
there&#39;s the people that are gonna you
know other voices and these people that
aren&#39;t going to totally get it in your
life yeah and then there&#39;s people
they&#39;re gonna throw hot dogs at you
cuz that&#39;s happened to me way too often
that&#39;s another story but so what as long
as you believe as long as you keep
getting up right and when you get up
there&#39;s different opportunities that are
gonna happen that you have no idea my
friends and trust me it&#39;s that concept
of showing up full circle life you don&#39;t
even know but if you could picture a
place that you would never imagine a
million years would hire me to come in
and fire up the crowd what would you
think would you think like the world
knitting Association maybe right
no the US Open tennis in New York City
you know the tennis right please quiet
please
seven years ago they decided someone
narrow in my the way I look at is they
took off their mask and they decided to
take a chance on me and so they brought
me out I performed in front of 25,000
people at Flushing Meadows firing up the
crowd and when I fired up the crowd the
crowd fired up the players and when the
players got excited everyone was happy
[Applause]
there&#39;s novak djokovic someone who knows
exactly what it&#39;s like to play without
their mask on to live without their mask
on and that moment was full circle for
me because everyone was kind of cheering
each other on and saying you know what
let&#39;s just give us a try and seven years
later I&#39;ve been performing every year at
the US Open at moments like that you
know I didn&#39;t make that tennis team but
I made it to center court at the US Open
I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t make it on any
hockey team I ever played a couple years
ago I made it to the Stanley Cup Finals
you know I tried every year to make it
in basketball and every time I go back
to my hometown I like to call up the
coach that wouldn&#39;t put me on the team
and let him know that I made it to the
NBA Finals so think about it if I can
figure out a way to make a living
acting like a lunatic at sporting events
and throwing t-shirts out and dancing
like a nut
I&#39;m pretty sure you can do whatever you
want to do with your life but what does
make it look like to you what does make
it look like to you and you need to
define that and build your foundation
right now that&#39;s where the excitement is
that&#39;s where the excitement is I want to
challenge every single one of you in
this room to get rid of that concept of
having a mask on and just live your true
self and I want you to think of
something right now think of something
right now
it&#39;s just get that moment that you want
in your life whether it&#39;s joining a club
playing on a team asking someone out but
being too afraid starting a job starting
an online business starting a charity
event
what is that for you and I want you to
think about it when that is completely
clear in your mind I want you to stand
up in this room when I say go I want you
to stand up when it&#39;s clear in your mind
stand up tall stand up proud ready and
go
feels pretty good doesn&#39;t it feels
pretty good doesn&#39;t it look around you
the community is supporting you everyone
in this room the crowd wants you to
succeed
believe in yourself trust it and keep
getting on whatever chairs there are out
there in your life and dance like
everyone is watching and promise me one
thing
promise me one thing you&#39;ll keep taking
those masks off for the rest of your
life thank you so much eagle Brooke I&#39;m
cheering for you
