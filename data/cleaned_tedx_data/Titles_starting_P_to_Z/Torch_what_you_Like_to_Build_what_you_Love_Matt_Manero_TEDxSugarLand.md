for most of my adult life and most of my
business career I had one goal you may
agree or disagree with it but the goal
was to build a hundred million dollar
business and to do that from a dumpy
one-bedroom apartment with no contacts
no money a folding table and a phone and
a Yellow Pages if you remember what a
Yellow Pages really really seemed like a
pipe dream but in 2013 after fighting
and kicking and scratching my team and I
hit that number we had built a hundred
million dollar a year business it was
supposed to have felt better right
and we fought so hard and it didn&#39;t
didn&#39;t feel great and when I would lie
in bed with my wife next to me and our
three boys in their rooms I just
couldn&#39;t get comfortable with the fact
that it was sustainable I said it&#39;s I&#39;m
gonna lose it it&#39;s it&#39;s not I can&#39;t keep
it it&#39;s built on sand the reason I felt
like that the reason you might feel like
that in your business is because every
business is the reflection of the owner
guaranteed so the chaos that goes on in
your business and maybe in your
employees lives for whatever those
reasons are are a reflection of you and
as I began to search for it I kept going
back and back and back it was a wild
time for me to start remembering all of
the pain that created this incredible
fuel that fueled me to get the goal of a
hundred million dollar business and it
took me all the way back to when I was
six months old and my birth father left
my mother and I high and dry piece
gone never seen from never heard from
again
I remember the visualization of the kids
teasing me in school being bullied being
called fat Matt almost my entire
elementary career and then when my
mother remarried and her husband adopted
me I remember being called idiot moron
retard stupid
everyday by him see I believe that we
create lives not to be who we are but
who can protect what we quarantine we
build lives around the pain that we
quarantine and what that ends up doing
is creating an opportunity for us to
never be us we create a personality a
persona an image that is connected to
quarantine the pain to playing it safe
to preserving it don&#39;t let it creep out
don&#39;t let that pain seep we never really
live a life of our full potential it
started to make me crazy I wish I could
say I dealt with it well but I started
to get crazy literally maniacal the
morning meetings that used to be so
motivational to get us on the road right
became bitch sessions and beat downs and
those underdogs that I fought my whole
life to help I started to call him out
in front everybody now I&#39;m not terrible
they were what a loser they are that
they couldn&#39;t do what they&#39;re supposed
to do and one day I had a live radio
show back then and it was in a studio in
our offices and our sound guy could
never get it right like we could never
get that mic right we would get the
caller on the phone and we would drop
the caller every single time
on live radio and I said to him you&#39;re
gonna this week you&#39;re gonna get that
radio show right you&#39;re gonna do your
job and you&#39;re gonna get it done right I
sit down the light goes on dead mic I&#39;ll
fix it I&#39;ll fix I&#39;ll fix it get it next
caller comes on the line hey caller
dropped and then probably the lowest
moment hard for me to even admit that I
did this but I did I literally took the
mic and I ripped it out of the steel
holder that it was in and I smashed it
through all of the flat screens behind
me and then I smashed all of the
lighting equipment in the suti I
destroyed my own studio and then you
know what I did
I threw the mic at the guy I opened the
door to leave the studio all of my
employees were looking at me with fear
did I kill the guy manera was officially
lost it was the look in their eyes they
were afraid I had officially become a
monster I had become everything I said I
was supposed to fight against to be the
underdog man to fight against judgment
the fight against the establishment to
get my piece of the American Pie to get
rich and I completely flipped it on its
head I went into my office I shut the
door and I cried I said that&#39;s it I&#39;m
gonna fix it I&#39;m gonna change it I&#39;m
gonna torch the whole damn thing I&#39;m
gonna burn it to the ground I don&#39;t care
how much it cost me I don&#39;t care if the
company goes to zero this is not who I&#39;m
supposed to be this is not how I&#39;m
supposed to treat these people who help
me build a business i&#39;ma fix it you got
the courage to do that in your world -
you need to do it in your world
because the fuel that you have whether
it&#39;s pain whether it&#39;s happiness might
be one of those lucky happy ones right
or you didn&#39;t have any pain
whatever that fuel is it burns out and
you got to find new fuel and you got to
get to the next level
you got a torch what you like to get
what you love you cannot live a life
that says I&#39;m good I&#39;m okay I&#39;m safe I&#39;m
secure you want to push you want to
challenge yourself you don&#39;t want to be
acceptant in the fact that you didn&#39;t go
for it
and to do that you may have to torch the
exact thing that got you to a life that
you like and you got to cook it and burn
it I brought everybody and I said we&#39;re
calling it the torch by the way and
here&#39;s the first thing we&#39;re gonna do
forget everybody together we&#39;re gonna
start talking we&#39;re gonna create a
mission statement you&#39;ve heard some
people talk about how important your why
is the reason most people don&#39;t have a
lie is because they don&#39;t know how to
structure a why it doesn&#39;t come natural
to them you need a system to figure out
what your why is you find your why when
you create a mission statement that you
stand for why do you exist it&#39;s
important in your business too if you&#39;re
struggling in your business is because
your people don&#39;t know what your
business exists for start with a mission
statement why are we here
we move to four core values what are we
gonna tolerate what line in the sand are
we not willing to cross my favorite core
value is core value number two we call
it personal happiness we&#39;re here because
we want to be here that&#39;s the whole core
value that&#39;s it I mean what&#39;s better
than that I want to work with people I
like I want them to be happy coming to
work and then it&#39;s finished the torch
finished with an employment agreement a
trust agreement if you will in which it
said a few simple things you can leave
our company at any time you can go to
work for one of our competitors you can
go into business for yourself in our
industry competing against us you just
can&#39;t do one thing you can&#39;t take food
off our plate you can&#39;t take your
customers seven people my top people
refused to sign that and just like that
we were 30 million down how much of a
price would you pay to torch it are you
financially sound in your business that
you could actually take a step like that
I&#39;m here to challenge you do it anyway
torch what you like to get what you love
how do you know if the torch will work
though how do you know whether it was
worth it or that it&#39;s actually working
out i&#39;ma challenge you and say that
you&#39;re not going to know that you&#39;re
gonna feel you&#39;re gonna feel when that
laughter comes back around you&#39;re gonna
feel when people out of the corner of
you eye of your eye are smiling at you
again you know that feeling right
they&#39;re looking at you and they&#39;re
saying he or she is good again you&#39;re
gonna feel it when like it happened to
me not too long ago one of my top guys
came into my office and said can I close
the door I said sure he said I just want
to apologize to you I know that I fought
you so hard against this torch but I
hated you
I hated who you would become you had let
me down he said I didn&#39;t trust you
anymore he says I just want to tell you
today I like you and I do trust you and
I&#39;m all-in
you&#39;re gonna feel when it works when
maybe you&#39;re sitting next to your spouse
for the first time in a long time
he or she&#39;s gonna reach down and touch
your knee and you&#39;re gonna reach back
and you&#39;re gonna touch his or hers
you&#39;re gonna feel the power of that
connection again the power of what it&#39;s
like to be on a team you&#39;re gonna know
it works and you&#39;re gonna feel it when
you walk through that front door and
those kids run to you again and they hug
ya and they say dad how about we go
throw the ball and you say sounds like a
great idea thank you
