thank you for coming today and sharing
in this conversation with me I&#39;m here to
tell you that while we will talk about
healthcare and we will talk about MIT
hacking medicine we will talk about the
fact that I&#39;m really here to tell you
how I&#39;ve hacked myself and I want to
leave here today with the message that
as long as you&#39;re alive and on this
earth you too can make a difference and
an impact by going through a journey of
self introspection so my journey started
with learning about a group that really
challenges healthcare to answer the
questions that we haven&#39;t been able to
answer when I joined my MBA at Sloan I
chanced upon a group MIT hacking
medicine just because they had food and
as a hungry student I went to get grab
dinner and sitting there I said oh my
gosh I found my people I found my tribe
not only do they immediately accept me
for who I am but they accept my crazy
ambition to be here to have an impact to
change the world and make it a better
place
and for those of you that have felt that
in their heart and have sometimes felt a
little bit crazy saying it out loud this
was exactly the group that I was looking
for and over the course of several
months to years I learned that executing
and orchestrating a hackathon with its
diverse group of thinkers so you bring
together engineers designers clinicians
software people and you get them to
iterate on problems to try to come up
with clever prototypes but wait for
those of you in the audience still
wondering what a hackathon is let&#39;s take
a moment to talk about the word hack so
you&#39;re gonna hear this word a lot today
hack and it often will conjure up
negative connotations because in today&#39;s
day and age you may feel that this is
all about getting into somebody&#39;s
personal data on a computer but in fact
the term was coined and has a multitude
of origins one of which is the Dutch
word hacking I hope I&#39;m pronouncing that
right especially here in Antwerp
but that means to break up into little
pieces and so at MIT the word hack
really came from a clever solution so
thing where you see a problem and you
quickly try to put together something
fussing with machines or technologies
with these super smart engineers to
provide a solution and then now it&#39;s
become applicable to several spheres and
disciplines and as it&#39;s done that one of
those disciplines is healthcare so as I
was saying I would go to these
healthcare events let me tell you the
first one I went to because I think
it&#39;ll be enough to tell you the story as
I was there I really met this young
woman named Kezia who herself came as a
patient a woman diagnosed in her mid-30s
with cancer who while undergoing her
cancer treatments her young baby
developed a malignant and terminal
cancer as well and so she would go and
have chemotherapy in the mornings and
then muster enough energy to show up at
these hackathon events to talk about how
she has been taking her baby to the
hospital for multiple treatments and
noticing how difficult it is for a child
who&#39;s in and out of the hospital who
scared who&#39;s lonely whose family members
are watching all of these tubes and
lines being placed in them to get
diagnosis and treatment and how she
really wants in the world that even
though her baby is sick and dying and
eventually did pass away she&#39;s using
that strength to say how can I help that
experience for other children but you
know what that wasn&#39;t the most important
lesson I&#39;ve come to realize that I
learned from cassia that&#39;s hope and
strength and inspiration we&#39;ll come back
to that the most important thing I
didn&#39;t even notice that I knew upfront
and that was that her husband Mike would
always come with her to these events he
would drive her there later learning
that she was too sick to drive herself
he would hang back while she would go
and chat with the teams and share her
experiences and answer questions and
then he would always step in with a
glass of juice or saying would you like
to sit down because you&#39;re tired or
you&#39;re not feeling as well maybe we
should leave I noted that I pocketed it
but then I immediately returned to the
task
coaching the teams helping them build
tools with the prototype materials we
had I realize that the fun at a
hackathon is that as grown-ups we never
really get to work with play-doh or foam
board like they do at companies like I
do and really put together stuff and so
suddenly that became what I thought was
the important work at the hackathons but
I also started noticing something else
why do people come they give an entire
weekend of their time to help solve
somebody else&#39;s problems they come as I
started to learn because it&#39;s joyous to
come together in these small groups
these small low sigh and really think
about what matters in the world and kind
of return to that feeling that we want
to help other human beings then
something else interesting happened
about a year and a half of running
medical hackathons around the world and
also at MIT my children started asking
me about what these hackathons were and
so I started bringing my eldest daughter
Sarah and then I started bringing
Michelle and Adam and I noticed they had
no trouble at all understanding this
concept because children don&#39;t see
boundaries with trying to solve problems
like we do as grown-ups in fact I&#39;ll
never forget what my daughter said
Michelle said after I introduced her to
a team of my friends and said you can be
part of their team
so as we&#39;re driving home at the end of
the weekend she says mom hanging out
with your adult friends was really
boring and I said why she said because
they said they were gonna solve problems
they were gonna take elderly people that
had had strokes and were having trouble
walking and they were gonna work on it
and then mom they spent the next day
talking about the problem they never
found an older person that had had a
stroke they never wore the devices that
exist out there to try to measure their
gait and they never really built
anything so mom while your friends are
super smart they&#39;re not super effective
long story short she joined another team
where they actually built a prototype
and she&#39;s showing me this and it
suddenly struck me it struck me then in
finding out how as adults were so
skeptical because we&#39;re so smart
we&#39;ve been so well educated and trained
to know why things won&#39;t work but again
that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here today I&#39;m here
today to tell you that while all of
those hackathons are attended by folks
that want to have impact create
companies were we&#39;re impacting health
care and patients and certainly all of
that is true
what I&#39;ve really come to learn from
attending these healthcare hackathons is
what made me pause about Michelle&#39;s
comment that day which is perhaps at
some point I have to think about what
matters to me and how I can discover
about the most important things about
myself and it was only through these so
let me share with you the two things
that I noticed the first is why do
people come so connection in a world
where we have so many devices why do so
many of us feel so lonely why is there
such an increasing rate of depression
why do we feel alone and yet people come
to interact for the weekend and I view
the hands shown on this photo as really
the the folks at the hackathon bonding
together for two to three days to really
build something but is this what
everybody craves because what I realized
is while this is important this is what
we all really desire wanting to get to
or at least I desire wanting to get to
as a human being the close connectivity
the feeling of security and being loved
and cared for by those we care about and
doing that in return why is that so
scary for us or for me as a human being
I started to realize that why is it that
we&#39;re chasing as human being so many
things around us are we taking that
moment to pause to really think about
what matters to us and the second thing
I realized is hope it is so important to
think about the lesson that this young
woman Kezia taught me that even despite
being sick she was grounded in the
knowledge that if she continued on her
path as long as she was alive that she
would at least be able to impact her
family by making them feel that she had
hope instead of despair and that was
clearly evident in the pride that her
and her husband had for her now why am I
talking about this today because hope
has a ripple effect so as I learned
connectivity and help are important and
as I learned all right I&#39;ve gone ahead
and become an ear nose and throat
surgeon I&#39;ve traveled the world we&#39;ve
been running these medical hackathons
I&#39;ve joined an MBA class where by gosh
I&#39;m the dumbest kid in the class at math
with all these accountants and
super-smart engineers but I&#39;m thriving
what is it still that I&#39;m looking for
so I finally did something that those of
us that deliver care to other people
never do I sought help and through the
advice of a friend in a very personal
journey over the last few months I said
okay I&#39;m gonna go talk to a therapist
and see what they have to offer now mind
you I was entirely skeptical about this
process I go in I sit down I tell her
let me tell you the litany of successes
that I&#39;ve had and she says well it
appears to me that you&#39;re afraid and I
scoffed afraid my gosh I went away to
college I married sadiq my husband of 20
years the first guy I dated we had
children in medical training I built a
surgical practice I did an MBA at MIT
what do I have to be afraid of and she
asked me the next question a very
dreaded question that I challenge you
all here today as you&#39;re listening to
these talks to ask yourself when you
look in the mirror do you really love
who you are and do you love what you&#39;re
doing and how you&#39;re going about it in
life and as she said that I thought to
myself whoa boy this is gonna take a
little bit of time and probably a lot of
money to answer and I noticed that
uncomfortable laugh right that we all
just had because that&#39;s the really hard
stuff how are we doing with the locus of
people that immediately surround us that
really care about us and that have
gotten us through the hard times and
when I came to realizes I may have spent
weekends at a hackathon but have I ever
spent one total weekend
with my family uninterrupted working on
what matters
us I mean sure we might come together
for the weekend but we&#39;re usually
running to activities and then we might
gather for dinner where we share our
experiences and then we scatter as I was
watching this process to our unfinished
work and our personal devices so let me
say that again we gather together in
families but then we scatter and after
we scatter that period of time we say
it&#39;s quality not quantity but I started
to realize is that what I really wanted
in life and through a very personal
journey I discovered in order to really
connect with family and friends you
first have to understand what makes you
tick really figure out what gives you
hope and that&#39;s my challenge for you all
today because once you figure out where
you want ahead in life what impact you
want to have and what makes you happy
you&#39;re then able to provide that support
and give it to the people that matter
the most to you and that is why
sometimes we feel like we&#39;re chasing
those external badges of success and so
if you thought coming here today I would
give you a TEDx speech that would say go
out and hack the world go to a medical
hackathon solve problems for healthcare
all of that is true but what I&#39;m also
coming here to say is life can be very
challenging and in order to get through
the hardest times you first have to
start by hacking yourself on a daily
basis and really questioning what you do
for those around you that you love so
that in return you can support each
other and really feel connected and that
being said I realized that what matters
most to me in life is my family
and so there&#39;s a photo of my family and
as a result I came to Antwerp and it&#39;s
wonderful to be here with you today and
I brought my son Adam because I wanted
him to see what it is that I&#39;ve been
doing when I&#39;ve been so busy but I want
to leave you all with three messages the
first is never give up on yourself I
think that you&#39;re all here today because
you want to have a more intimate
conversation about things that you care
about the second is you can continue
to hack yourself until the day you die
as long as you&#39;re alive and breathing
you&#39;re able to continue to work on
yourself and it&#39;s only as grown-ups that
have been overly educated that we decide
well I&#39;m done I shouldn&#39;t I shouldn&#39;t
really be learning anything new
clearly you&#39;re here today to learn
something new and the third is don&#39;t
lose hope
it&#39;s what&#39;s brought us here today and to
be honest it can accomplish things that
we never knew we can imagine as we see
change in the world and it&#39;s really
what&#39;s going to save us in the end
thank you
[Applause]
