when I was growing up I dreamed of the
stars
I was dreaming to be a mom those get to
touch those stars he get to build the
spacecraft that would get us there like
so many others I dreamt of working at
NASA I started my aeronautical degree
and I was on my way one day three years
ago everything changed
that day I learned that the industry
that I adored so much aerospace he&#39;s one
of the main pollutants to our
environment what did strike me even more
was that most exotic industries like
agriculture
I even more harmful for our planet one
of the main issues behind the problem of
agricultural pollution is fertilizer
waste back at the day it didn&#39;t make any
sense to me the industry that is
supposed to sustain and support our
environment is in fact hurting it yet it
was true and I was there with my skills
of an aeronautical engineer hoping to
develop a solution that would mitigate
this problem and I realized that I could
make a technology that could reduce
agricultural waste and it would come
from Aeronautical developing the
technology is something that I was
always in love with well I was growing
out dreaming of working for primes there
was something that I wanted more and
that was to make a difference I found an
opportunity to do that here in Australia
here I found a supervisor that shared my
vision and the opportunity to apply my
research to the real-world problems
to make world a better place I did not
say incoming moving to Australia to do a
PhD
neither did my Ukrainian family they
seriously asked me if I knew how far
astray Leah would they had the point it
was very far yet here I found the
climate I could flourish in actually
let&#39;s get back to the climate every year
globally agriculture wastes 10 billion
dollars on fertilizer waste 10 billion
dollars straight out of farmers pockets
into fresh waters polluting them
intoxicating soils causing this vicious
cycle if you like me you&#39;re probably
wondering at this point how come let me
share with you what I&#39;ve discovered if
you&#39;re a farmer in the country like
Australia you&#39;ll probably taken care of
the paddock of the size of a small
European country and this is a load of
land to take care of and you can&#39;t
simply have the time to pay attention to
each of the individual crops so you need
to take decisions quickly you as a
farmer can take an average crop the
tournament&#39;s average health and send the
tractor so it can apply the average rate
of the fertiliser across the field you
see what the problem here is the crops
over here might be thirsty whilst us
over there will be hungry one size fits
all strategy simply fails in this case
it results in huge inefficiencies
wasting fertilizer meaning money that
you&#39;ve spent on it but also causing
environmental damage that then we are
left to mitigate there should be a
better way of tackling the problem of
fertiliser waste and this is why we
started a startup Clarissa
so what we do is we take the pictures of
the farms with infrared cameras on
drones and satellites to work out where
the fertilizers needed the most to give
this prescription to the farmer so they
they can save on their input costs and
effectively manage their yields we call
this satellite guided fertilizer I still
remember the first day of our trials in
Narrabri New South Wales meet summer
heat 38 degrees Celsius
we&#39;re flying our drones up and down from
paddock to paddock we got so hot and
dusty and sweaty
even our drone got tired that day I
learned how incredibly tough the
agriculture is in this country and how
incredibly resilient those crops and
farmers have to be to make it happen for
us all to feed and clothe us that day
gave me the motivation to develop the
technology that would help the
agricultural production to build those
drones that would grow our food most of
you would know that UN estimates that by
2050 70% more food has to be grown with
our current agricultural practices this
is simply impossible we are wasting so
much fertilizer we are intoxicated in
our soils and waters we are getting left
with less and less arable land every
year the technology that would take this
space would have to be usable profitable
and sustainable obviously this problem
existed for decades the farmers have
been used in satellite imagery to inform
their decisions on the form satellites
are great they orbit the globe taking
the pictures of the farm making them
available online so that the farmer can
see their farm at his convenience or her
what is the drawback of satellites
oh gee she might be not aware of is that
satellites can&#39;t see through clouds when
agriculture is done under the clouds
this makes satellite imagery a very
unreliable source of information for
farming and farmers simply forced to
look for another option and we have seen
that the drones can feel in this space
and be there where the farmer needs them
to be and when now how does it all come
together both satellites and drones take
pictures of the farm with those fancy
infrared cameras when the drone is
scouting the paddock it is able to see
the damage to cropped seven to ten days
prior it&#39;s visible to human eye by
capturing the infrared bands the
drawings are working out where the
fertilizer is needed and then the
tractor goes following the drawing
fertilizer map and applies it in exactly
the right rate so that the farmer can
reduce their cost and improve their
yields in the future will be seen drones
becoming more and more useful on the
farm when they can autonomously recharge
and refuel they can take this crop from
sowing to harvest and take care of it on
its own by monitoring spot sprain
identifying early stress this will be
the drawings that will grow our food
this technology has global impact more
more importantly it has financial
benefit to the farmer having an infrared
map built by drawing means that for a
cotton farmer who has half a million
fertilizer budget for a season a
reduction of 10 or 20 percent which
easily equates to over $100,000 more
importantly full farmer themself that
doesn&#39;t just reduce their costs or you
know it&#39;s handy to not go to the paddock
at the peak of the summer heat
more importantly it des risks their
business this is the vital layer of
information which they can use to
effectively manage their farm with water
and fertilizer prices growing every year
and with commodity prices fluctuating
wildly we need to help farmers pull all
this information to improve the
production bottom line the bad news is
that this technology it&#39;s not available
everywhere farmers in developing
countries still don&#39;t have access to the
most recent tax so when we are
developing this technology we need to be
responsible and sustainable we need to
think of those who needed to because
think of it
fertilizer waste is not limited to our
country borders with their country
borders we can all thrive or all suffer
together aeronautical engineers don&#39;t
come off into agriculture to help yet
when they do when they&#39;re not too busy
building their rockets they transfer
amazing technology that can help solve
those important issues I&#39;m 25
still for another week or so and I&#39;m
finishing my PhD in visual navigation
for drones and I&#39;ve been extremely
fortunate to pursue my dream to make an
impact on my environment and I sincerely
hope that you can find a way you can do
that too thank you
