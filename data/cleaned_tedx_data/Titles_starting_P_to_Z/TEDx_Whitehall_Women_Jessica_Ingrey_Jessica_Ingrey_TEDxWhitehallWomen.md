from Alan Turing to Bill Gates
you could easily name a male that has
contributed to the computing industry
right but did you know that it was in
fact a female Ada Lovelace who was the
world&#39;s first programmer I certainly
didn&#39;t until recently so it&#39;s no wonder
that by 2040 only 1% of the tech sector
is expected to be female and in 2016
this gender gap conch boosted to nearly
57,000
tech developer roles being unfilled now
I have an idea that could change all of
this an online platform that celebrates
the achievements of inspiring women in
tech reaching anyone without any
boundaries stereotypically boys are
connected to tech through gaming but
it&#39;s different for girls the platform
would offer many collaborative coding
challenges relating to aspects of a
young woman&#39;s life exciting even girls
with no prior experience for example
creating a chat bot that comforts its
user or coding part of an online
shopping checkout or writing a cipher
that encrypts secret messages between
friends
and perhaps most importantly the
platform would also attempt to raise the
negative stigma around the label geek
which seems to cause isolation when
really all most teenage girls want to do
is fit in girls in tech need to be
redefined as vital for our future so why
is this important
well it is estimated that if we were to
close the gender gap it would be worth
600 billion pounds for UK also by
increasing our genders input on highly
debated issues such as the use of
artificial intelligence it would be
diversifying the current way of thinking
and could perhaps even majorly benefit
the future of our species thank you
