hello everyone my name is Nicole tanner
and I&#39;m a year for medical student at
the chinese university of hong kong oh
that&#39;s me right there
Nicole&#39;s Anatomy so when I was seven
years old I wanted to be a doctor and my
parents got me this book it was the
little encyclopedia of the human body
my parents claimed they didn&#39;t try to
brainwash me but who gets their kid this
book am i right Jennifer right so I had
this book when I was a little kid and I
absolutely loved it I would read it
every single day and I try to memorize
every little fact how many inches of an
intestine fit into my body how many
milliliters of sweat my glands produced
and I absolutely was fascinated by the
intricacy of the human body so as I grew
up in the past eleven years I&#39;ve been
doing a lot of surgical attachments
going to different hospitals to try to
pursue this dream and when it was 2013 I
applied to medical school at cuhk now
when I first got to medical school I
kind of assumed that medicine would kind
of be like Grey&#39;s Anatomy or house or
dr. X you do you guys know what I&#39;m
talking about that kind of film but when
I got to medical school the situation
was quite different first of all nobody
is really that good-looking
I wish Oh second of all I countered a
lot of different problems I was very
lost by how much information medicine
was and I was also always challenged by
people you know I&#39;d go to these family
dinners and there&#39;s always that one
relative that takes out her bag of
medicine I know that&#39;s these little
pills right and she&#39;s like all had a
coffee last week and there&#39;s this pill
that I take it&#39;s white and it&#39;s about
this size you know which one I was like
oh that one no idea oh but when I got
into medical school I absolutely loved
cuhk it&#39;s
the best but I found myself so
overwhelmed by the knowledge that is
medicine I was so lost I think you know
I&#39;m the only student speaker here
tonight and when I saw the list of
speakers I was a little bit overwhelmed
but I want to speak to you guys student
to student I think a lot of you know
what it&#39;s like to be me I know when your
teacher writes something on the board
like a calculus equation she says
something annoying like you guys all
know this right and you have no idea
what she&#39;s talking about that&#39;s how I
felt for the past four years of medicine
I would go to these hospitals and I
would wash these doctors work and I
would have no idea what they were doing
and everyone in my class was so smart I
spent so much of my time trying to catch
up trying to get to the same pace I just
chasing knowledge I was chasing to be
the same pace as everybody else
and I just felt ridiculously lost and
eventually I think my fear of medicine
overtook my passion for medicine I
became so scared I was always concerned
about my grades my exams I was so
concerned about surviving medicine that
I forgot why I was there in the first
place
and that&#39;s when I was in year three I
encountered something that changed my
life I got into robotic surgery so what
is robotic surgery well it&#39;s an
interesting development in medicine
where we have a robot right there as the
name implies on the right and so those
are the arms of the robot and on the
Left we have a surgeon and he sits at
what is what is called a tele
manipulator and looks into this screen
that has a 3d view of surgery and then
he has these little arms that act is
sort of like a video game and you work
and while you work that goes the
connection goes into the robot which in
the effector arm kind of carries out the
surgery and when I first watched my
number one robotic surgery I
remember I walked into the room and um I
still remember I walked in and I and I
saw the patient sort of in the middle of
the room just like that with a nurse
around and I asked someone next to me I
said Oh has a surgery not started yet
and she&#39;s like no no no it started I
said Oh unless you know I don&#39;t see the
surgeon did he you know go for a coffee
break like pumpkin spice latte in the
middle of the day and she&#39;s like no the
surgeons right there and she points the
opposite corner of the room and there he
was sitting there and right above which
there was this huge screen and I
remember it was a colorectal surgery
which means a surgery of the colon and
the rectum and I still remember how
fascinated and how caught up I was in
the moment of watching that first it was
almost like I was inside this guy&#39;s body
and today I want to bring you to that
exact same experience that I had two
years ago um this is actually can I play
the video this is a robotic surgery it&#39;s
a removal of a gall bladder from the so
that right there is the gall bladder and
that&#39;s the liver the gallbladder is
stuck to the liver with a lot of tissues
in between and that hook is the robot
the robotic arm and it&#39;s start peeling
the gallbladder away from the liver just
a little bit I&#39;m sorry I forgot to say
disclaimer if you&#39;re not into this thing
or you&#39;re eating pork liver after
tonight this is not a good video to
watch virtual peeling and that&#39;s the
gallbladder right there and he puts it
into the bag and the bags inside the
body and then they rip it out of the
body like that that&#39;s amazing right no
just me
okay okay you know for four years of my
education
oh well hello can we go back one slide
go back to slides for four years of my
education I looked at something like
this which a lot of you students
probably recognize Anatomy textbook I
always felt very just connected to my
education I felt this connected to what
I was reading and the information I was
given I felt no relationship to it but
when I watched that robotic surgery
I suddenly realized that there was so
much more about the human body so much
that I was still so fascinated about I
felt like I was that seven year old
again you know when I was seven years
old reading that little encyclopedia of
the human body it was that moment again
I was so entranced by the whole
experience and that ladies and gentlemen
it&#39;s what technology can do for our
education when I was in that surgery I
realized that there was so much that was
advancing in medicine that I was missing
because I was so caught up in knowing
things for my exam studying things that
were only to be tested
you know whenever my teacher said
something like this isn&#39;t gonna be in
the exam but you know I&#39;d always hear
the rest of the sentence says bla bla
bla bla but there&#39;s actually so much
knowledge out there that is so
interesting
that makes us passionate you know I
realized that medicine is advancing such
a fast rate technology is advancing so
fast and being a part of that journey is
what makes medicine something so
scientific and art you know with robotic
surgery nowadays it&#39;s it&#39;s so crazy
because you&#39;ll see a patient on the on
the table doing a surgery and the next
day they&#39;ll be walking around chatting
having coffee and a traditional surgery
the scar or the incision where we cut
it&#39;s starting from the beginning of your
chest all the way to almost your groin a
very very long scar and you open it up
with a retractor and then you operate
that way
but with robotic surgery the arm only
needs four to five
holls of about this size so you have
patients waking up from surgery having
scars that are really you can barely
find the scars I mean it&#39;s very very
good for bikini season research has
shown that robotic and minimally
invasive surgery has done so much for
our patients it decreases the risk of
infection decreases risks of bleeding
shortens hospital stay it causes less
pain for the patient as well and for
cases where you have patients with HIV
and hepatitis it decreases the risk for
the surgeon as well and that moment
encountering robotic surgery was when I
found my passion and for the past year
I&#39;ve been doing a lot of research
clinical research into robotic surgery
and into laparoscopic surgery and how we
can improve that we can continue to
improve that technology for generations
to come
I want to end this talk with a story it
was a very interesting story that
actually happened to me this week I was
thinking about my topics what how I can
tie all of this passion into a catalytic
experience as the theme of tonight is
and this week is interesting I had a
patient and a very interesting thing
just so right before we watch a surgery
as medical students the day before we
need to go and Clark the case which
means talking the patient finding out
their history and also doing a
examination on the patient and so me and
my friends we go to this patient and we
start talking to him and he&#39;s very
talkative IB tells me everything about
his history like ever he tells me his
pets his favorite color everything he&#39;s
very talkative
and this guy is an IV drug addict he
Adam
he had hepatitis B hepatitis C and these
are both diseases that can be
transmitted if you have a needle Perkin
needle prick accidents and so we were
talking to him and you know I we talked
to about maybe three four patients a day
and then the clinics we see another 20
30 patients so
after that it was it it was no big deal
for me
this case was very interesting he had a
liver cancer so it was the liver cancer
on the right side of his liver and for
the surgery the next day he needed to
remove half of his liver so that the
liver cancer wouldn&#39;t recur now sorry I
would go back it&#39;s not that interesting
because liver cancer is very common you
gonna award a lot of patients have liver
cancer and the thing is a lot of medical
students are very numb to that by now
and so the next day I go to the surgery
and it was a robotic surgery from
robotic removal of half of the liver
it&#39;s about that size it&#39;s huge and again
I was so entranced by the surgery it was
about a four-hour surgery and I remember
I was there with my little 3d glasses
and it was it was such a mesmerizing
experience I absolutely loved the
surgery and the next day I go back to
the hospital and I&#39;m sitting outside the
I&#39;m sitting outside the hospital waiting
for the lips and I see this man staring
at me now this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t very
calm I don&#39;t know for you know some of
you but you know for me it&#39;s not very
common for someone be staring at me this
guy&#39;s staring at me and I look back at
him and I&#39;m and I smile I don&#39;t really
recognize him and he comes over and he&#39;s
like did you watch it I&#39;m like did I
watch what said my surgery that&#39;s like I
watched four surgeries yesterday like
who are you he said we had a really long
conversation I told you my pet I told
you my favorite colors and like oh
you&#39;re the liver guy you&#39;re the guy with
the liver cancer oh and he said yeah
that&#39;s me I&#39;m like have a seat sir and
so we sit outside the lifts and he&#39;s
like no tell me tell me everything about
this surgery and so I&#39;m like okay I&#39;ll
tell you everything I told him from the
beginning when they put those robot arms
in I told him about the how the surgeon
respected his liver how he took it out
and he would ask questions he was such a
good student he&#39;d be like okay but my
liver was huge right like how did they
take it out of me
oh well they had to widen your incision
just to remove it and where they&#39;re
having a 30-minute conversation and
while we were talking I kept thinking
this guy he&#39;s an IV drug addict he&#39;s 30
years older than me completely different
background completely different culture
language barriers we have nothing in
common and given any other day we would
have nothing to talk about but here we
were two people coming from two
different worlds and we were sharing a
30-minute conversation like we were old
friends and we were brought together we
were connected by the idea of medicine
and how amazing it is ladies and
gentlemen medicine helped robotic
surgery helped redefine my passion in
medicine there was a time when I felt
lost when I felt like I wasn&#39;t studying
for the right reasons but seeing robotic
surgery it helped me realize why I&#39;m
doing what I love doing and robotic
surgery and medical technology it&#39;s not
defining in my career I still have a
very very long way to go but I really
definitely did redefine my passion and I
want to encourage each and every one of
you today whether you&#39;re a student
whether you&#39;re the headmaster whether
you&#39;re just here with your kids whether
you&#39;re falling asleep
um I encourage you to find the robotic
surgery in your life find the thing that
redefines your passion find the thing
that gives you a new perspective and
just something that you&#39;ve spent your
whole life doing find the thing that
gives you a fresh breath of air because
when you find your passion when you find
what you absolutely love that&#39;s when you
can share that passion with the people
around you that&#39;s when you can be the
catalyst to the people that need you
that need your passion and so be a
catalyst to the IV drug addicts
found you redefined your passion thank
you very much
[Applause]
