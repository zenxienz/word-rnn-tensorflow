hi I have a question for you
how many of you know how to ride a
bicycle good how many of you are pretty
darn good at riding bicycle even better
and as you ride along on your bicycle
how many of you are calculating the
angular momentum you know P equals MBR
front-load steering geometry gyroscopic
effect no neither do I that&#39;s because we
know how to ride a bike implicitly we
know more than we can tell but that&#39;s
not how school works school tests what
we can tell I&#39;ve been working in schools
for over 25 years and I&#39;ve seen some of
our best learners slip through the
cracks
only because they know more than they
can tell so many kids can do so many
fabulous things but some of them just
aren&#39;t good at tests when we can measure
what they can do not just what they can
say that&#39;s when I believe we can provide
really inclusive education when we can
measure implicit learning what people
the knowledge that people build that
they demonstrate through their actions
and their behaviors that&#39;s when I think
we can capture all kinds of learning
like the creativity and idea generation
of learners with a DD or the systemic
thinking and detailed pattern
recognition that some learners with
autism really excel at or the disruption
in innovation that so many learners with
dyslexia seem to achieve some of our our
favorite entertainers have grown up with
dyslexia but also some of our inventors
activists entrepreneurs and even a Nobel
laureate in medicine you don&#39;t have to
be really good at tests to be great
problem solver
I believe that unleashing the potential
of these diverse learners is the key to
our future and I&#39;m not alone many IT
companies agree there
have hiring programs focusing on people
with cognitive differences because who
wouldn&#39;t want a design team that excels
an idea generation or a debugging team
who can&#39;t rest who&#39;s physically
compelled to go through every single use
case I want to tell you a story about a
girl named Renee she&#39;s at a junior high
where I spent a lot of time Renee is on
the autism spectrum and she&#39;s one of
those kids where you know she has it all
going on inside but she&#39;s just really
hard to reach when I met her she came up
to me head down no eye contact she said
your game designer I want to be a game
designer I want to design a game I was
designing game with a lot of cats and
there&#39;s a lot of cats and there&#39;s a Vale
clan and they live in the woods and she
went on and on with the story and I
thought okay this is great I&#39;m gonna
hook her up with scratch the program
that the environment that Mitch talked
about it&#39;s an introductory coding
environment so I let her I showed her
the program I logged her in and she
basically said thank you Miss and told
me to go away Renee was on education an
individual education plan IEP so she
didn&#39;t have the same expected outcomes
as the rest of her classmates but at the
end of the semester she stood up she
showed us a 25-minute
intricate animation lots of different
narrative scene changes dialogue lots
and lots of cats she showed us a in the
coding that she did was much more
sophisticated than the coding of the
rest of her classmates Renee used
scratch to show us a little piece of her
private world and also that she has
talents and skills that need to be
unleashed so how do we support the
implicit learning of Renee and those
like her and those not like her for
teachers to do this one-on-one is
extremely time intensive and with the
diversity of learners in their classroom
it&#39;s nearly impossible we need data
analytics that can help us do this at
scale and these data analytics exist
they&#39;re already in use they&#39;re in use in
computer games video games phone and
tablet games any digital games just like
we are able to see what people know
what they don&#39;t know by using data
analytics and games and we&#39;re able to do
this at scale
I&#39;m going to show you an example this is
a typical physics test question in fact
this is one of the easier questions from
the AC T it has to do with Newton&#39;s laws
of motion it&#39;s asking people to answer
questions about moving objects there is
no moving object on this test question
to answer this question I need to read a
paragraph of text interpret some some
figures and diagrams I may or may not
have seen before
I then have to recreate the scenario in
my head figure out what the question is
asking and then I can begin to answer it
I&#39;m going to show you a different way
for assessment this is a game that our
team at Turk created called impulse it
basically engages the player in that
exact same physics as that earlier test
question players must get their green
ball into that going blue goal by
imparting a quick force with the click
and guiding their ball into there and
they can&#39;t crash into any of the other
particles the other particles all have
different maths cording to their color
and they all obey Newton&#39;s laws of
motion so let&#39;s just listen for a minute
and watch
okay what we are hearing let it fly I&#39;m
gonna let it fly let it fly let it fly
alright notice he&#39;s not doing
calculations or using formulas but he&#39;s
saying I&#39;m gonna let it fly I&#39;m gonna
let it cruise I&#39;m gonna let it float or
as Sir Isaac Newton would say this
object in constant motion will remain in
constant motion unless I act upon it
with an external force he&#39;s not he&#39;s not
using the same words as Newton but
through his actions in the game we can
see that he gets it
players demonstrate knowledge and games
and we can use data analytics to see
this knowledge we can see what they know
and what they don&#39;t know just like
Google and Facebook and Amazon data
mining algorithms to see what you want
to buy next we can use data mining
algorithms to see what kids know what
they don&#39;t know and what a teacher needs
to use next to help them learn and we
can do it at scale imagine when a
teacher gets an alert that says hey your
player just used a float strategy
consistently they can walk up to them
and say oh tell me about your game play
and they can follow up with let me tell
you what Newton said about that our
research shows that when teachers
connect what kids learn in a game to
what there&#39;s the science they&#39;re
teaching in the class kids learn that
science better and we don&#39;t just do this
in physics we&#39;re now using a game called
zoombinis it&#39;s a really fun engaging
game that focuses on computational
thinking
it engages players in a series of logic
puzzles where they have to decompose
problems recognize patterns abstract
from those patterns and build algorithms
and we can watch it all through their
gameplay it&#39;s not just in games that we
can do this we&#39;re looking at how to
measure implicit learning in elementary
coding environments like scratch where
Renee build our cat game or blocks CAD
where you can build models
for 3d printers or Arduino environments
where you can code for robotics any
digital environment where people are
learning we can use analytics to see
that learning and we don&#39;t stop with
behavior data we&#39;re working with our
colleagues to look at emotional and
physical and neurological data and
infuse these all together into implicit
learning models because when we can go
beyond words on a test and we can look
at behaviors and gestures and even brain
signals to see what people know that&#39;s
when we can really capture all learning
because we know more than we can tell
thank you
