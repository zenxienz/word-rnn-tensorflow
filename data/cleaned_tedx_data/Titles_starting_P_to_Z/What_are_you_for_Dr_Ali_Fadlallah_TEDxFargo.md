what am i for well I&#39;m for Kiwis mangoes
and kisses on the forehead and writing
in weird angles until I need more lead
or more ink I&#39;m also for keyboards I&#39;m
never for being bored at worst I just
Bing and on me would you be bored I&#39;m
four phones down just be present be with
it I know you want to revisit but
instead of being in it you&#39;re like
future planning to be reminiscent I
don&#39;t get it
I do get it the phone is like a
lieutenant must know where we&#39;re going
why we&#39;re going who we&#39;re within who did
it and when we know who did it
I&#39;m for justice fairness we can&#39;t say
all lives matter just to prove we care
less about black lives so I&#39;m for black
lives and sometimes for white lies but
only if it&#39;s the dumb kind like Ali
you&#39;re such a fun guy me why thank you
I&#39;m for thank yous and parents who will
spank you what do you expect me to say
they messed up no thank you
I&#39;m for immigrants and accents and corny
jokes that lack sense and sporty clothes
every day in dorritos in every way I&#39;m
talking regular Ranch Tacos spicy baby
I&#39;m for spices but that&#39;s dicey maybe
like I&#39;ll take hot if it&#39;s Mexican but
if it&#39;s like Pakistani spice I need that
super light because y&#39;all are feisty
crazy
I&#39;m for truthfulness transparency even
when it&#39;s embarrassing
I&#39;m for not having sex and not having
pets unless you&#39;re ready for the
parenting that&#39;s how I feel what else
I&#39;m precisely and recycling
I am never for the Vikings and I&#39;m for
colon Kapernick because he did the right
thing I&#39;m for afros and weirdos and
weird clothes and earphones that too now
the Donald until I&#39;m in the clear
no just things I don&#39;t care to hear
folks I&#39;m for love Trump&#39;s fear folks
here it goes without a minute I mean I&#39;m
a Muslim for freedom to not be or to be
one and not feel endangered one stared
at by strangers
I&#39;m for positive music you&#39;re gifted
don&#39;t abuse it I&#39;m for minimalism I&#39;m in
a rhythm of donate or reuse it I just
traded in my wants and put my needs in
charge but don&#39;t you confuse it my life
still large just the itty-bitty sample
of things that I&#39;m for above all I&#39;m for
God and for love and whether we&#39;re poor
or we have more if we believe in one
love then we will rise above the bigotry
discrimination and hate not embracing
diversity of religion race because I&#39;m
not for what&#39;s happening now attempts to
destroy what should make us all proud
and I&#39;ll keep fighting through the storm
until we restore rainbows but at least
in a meanwhile I got Kiwis mangoes and
lots of kisses on the forehead and I&#39;ll
keep right on writing in weird angles
until I couldn&#39;t be more dead
that&#39;s a morbid ending yikes but Fargo
today you gave me life in Fargo you will
go far and lastly Fargo I and for you
thank you
[Applause]
