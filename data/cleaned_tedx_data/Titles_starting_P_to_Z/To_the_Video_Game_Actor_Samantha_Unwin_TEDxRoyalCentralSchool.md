it&#39;s 2017 actor Kit Harington has
appeared in the latest blockbusting
title British filmmaker Guy Ritchie
directed him upon disc release the title
sold more than 1.8 million copies in its
first week as part of a global industry
now with more than a hundred and eight
point nine billion dollars you&#39;d be
forgiven for flicking through a mental
catalogue of all of Hollywood&#39;s latest
releases but in fact I&#39;m talking about
Activision&#39;s video game Call of Duty
infinite warfare the game situates
itself as part of a growing trend video
game companies using cutting-edge
technologies in order to capture the
performance of an actor for use in their
final product as of eight years ago the
gaming industry is worth more than
Hollywood so increasingly we&#39;re finding
our favorite a listers appearing at the
tips of our controllers you need only
look at some of the names who have been
involved in the Call of Duty series it
begins to look more like a casting list
for the latest Sam Mendes movie than it
does anything else but a character in a
video game functions in many different
ways to that of one on stage or in film
think of the last video game you played
if you haven&#39;t played one recently then
imagine one begin to move around in that
world
you&#39;ll soon begin to realize that the
character functions is an extension of
yourself a mediator between our world
and the digital world you discover and
explore through them so it&#39;s fairly
important that you have at least some
kind of connection with them right I
mean you&#39;ll be spending a lot of time
with them most games now take over 40
hours to complete as well as that in
many modern games such as in a hugely
popular The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt
you get to make the moral or immoral
choices of the character and so you get
to decide the direction of the narrative
so you have to care about something in
some way in order for you to be able to
make that decision it&#39;s not like film
where you&#39;re an onlooker you are
directly implicated in this world so
character has to function in a
believable way that really draws you in
cue the actor now the actor&#39;s job is to
bring the character to life but this can
be an incredibly complex process the
amazing quality of graphics of
modern-day games consoles means that
designers are working in excruciating
detail so that the character moves and
functions in a natural human way not all
characters we control are humans but
they are humanoid in that they directly
resemble us so what better model than an
actual human being there is still a high
proportion of animation within the video
game design process but video game
companies are using motion capture
facial capture and voiceover as a means
of capturing an actor&#39;s performance we
all know of Andy Serkis is memorable
portrayal of column in The Lord of the
Rings series but motion capture is
possibly more widespread than you might
think if you&#39;ve ever played the game The
Last of Us you&#39;ve seen motion capture if
you&#39;ve ever played the game
any game in fact from the Uncharted
series you see motion capture if you&#39;ve
played any of the recent FIFA games
you&#39;ve guessed it you&#39;ve seen motion
capture it&#39;s used in a huge amount of
games so what actually happens during
the process of motion capture well an
actor will often wear a skin-tight suit
made of spandex and it&#39;ll be covered in
markers a bit like this now with the
help of a camera and a computer
the markle&#39;s will get digitized into a
sort of skeleton that records the
movement of the performer this is
actually very similar to facial capture
where the actor will wear markers on
their face a bit like this except now
often they&#39;ll have a camera mounted on
their head the markers will pick up the
actors facial expression and via the
camera it will be mapped digitally onto
a computer it&#39;s amazing what&#39;s possibly
more amazing is the fact that these
processes often both work out as quicker
and cheaper than if you were to purely
use animation alone in the creation of
the character for the voice-over artist
well you&#39;ll be recording your lines of
dialogue in what&#39;s often a very small
booth but on a very sensitive microphone
as you&#39;ve probably guessed the character
is then a combination of these different
performances spliced together with a
little help of an animator of course
this is why you might hear someone refer
to themselves as a Frankenstein
performer because much like the monster
from Mary Shelley&#39;s 1818 novel the
character is a stitching together of
these seemingly autonomous performances
as you can imagine this can be quite a
fragmentary experience for an actor so
how can we help well we can begin by
looking at the ways we currently train
our actors and seeing if we might be
able to adapt it to suit the needs of a
videogame performer I&#39;ve been looking
into some of these challenges firstly
let&#39;s consider the use of a syllabus
that really makes use of the imagination
as some of you may have realized the
title of my talk is in direct reference
to theatre practitioner Michael
Chekhov&#39;s book to the actor where he
strongly advocates the use of
imagination in training actors in many
ways it&#39;s even more important for a
video game performer performance capture
artists TJ storm once said that the best
directors he&#39;s ever worked with have
been artists who paint with imagination
an actor who has no stage a costume no
makeup no set no lighting sometimes
don&#39;t even a scene partner imagination
is crucial
motion capture actor Oliver Hollis Lake
once described an instance where he was
supposed to be running out of a burning
building he turned to his director and
he asked what&#39;s the building made from
the director didn&#39;t know it was all
gonna be burnt down anyway doesn&#39;t
matter Oliver responded and he said you
see if it&#39;s made of timber then I can
respond to the pops and the cracks of
the word as it burns and I can watch the
singed material as it floats gently in
the air these are the details that
really make a performance it&#39;s the same
for the voice-over artist
it may be yourself and a microphone but
if you don&#39;t really see or hear that
monster chasing you then we will know
for some people that feeling of
something not quite matching up in the
gameplay is enough to make them stop
playing the game completely if the actor
believes it then we believe it actor
Doug cockle voice of Geralt of Rivia
from The Witcher series once said to me
that we can hear the lie I strongly
believe that imagination is like a
muscle it can be trained and video game
performers have to be the Olympic
athletes of the imagination bear in mind
as well but these performers are also
making use of all of these different
pieces of technology whilst giving their
performance for many newcomers this can
be particularly difficult I mean I&#39;m not
sure how many of us have had experience
in a motion capture suit or in having a
camera strapped to our head while I was
trying to move around or even if just
talking into a really great quality
microphone so many actors are amazed at
how they sound on a really good mic for
The Witcher 3 Doug chuckles microphone
picked up the squeaking of his shoes
just imagine the detail it could pick up
in your voice so if an actor&#39;s job is to
give a natural performance they can&#39;t be
distracted by these pieces of technology
if distracted they won&#39;t be able to
fully commit to the act of believing in
to use the example from before that
monster chasing them so if an actor can
adapt to their performance for camera
for film then perhaps by giving them
experience in this technology beforehand
we may be able to help them adapt to the
videogame medium that ways practitioners
we can help to foster a natural
believable performance that we can
instantly connect with now a comfortable
actor is always grating but the fact
does remain it is a fragmentary process
but I think this is something that we
have a tendency to do as human beings to
break things down into bite-sized chunks
to compartmentalize now by this I mean
that drama schools will teach people how
to act how to move how to use their
voice we have acting coaches Voice
coaches movement coaches all incredibly
helpful for a whole number of reasons
but potentially problematic for a video
game performer whose process of
documentation is already so broken up
body face voice that they need a sense
of wholeness within their performance if
I was to say to someone that they are a
voice actor a voice person I may
therefore be very subtly suggesting that
they can&#39;t then be equally as great at
movement but you see when I speak it
originates as a thought in my mind
before my body helps me to produce the
sound we are all integrated beings and I
believe we should be trained as such if
you were all to direct an actor and say
could you make it sound as though you&#39;re
trying to tell me a secret whilst
running well so
trying to do this whilst actually
running will probably give a much more
believable performance than someone
who&#39;s trying to do it while standing
completely still the body informs the
voice and the voice informs the body if
then the process of documentation is to
remain compartmentalised
body face voice then the actors need
this sense of wholeness within their
performance so that for us and them it
feels as though it originated from a
thinking feeling integrated human being
then the actor feels good gives a great
performance and we can continue playing
as these brilliant exciting characters
who hopefully we perceive as something
whole and not as a construct of these
separate components now you might be
thinking or not now aside from adapting
a syllabus what&#39;s a more practical way
of addressing these challenges I have
you covered it&#39;s probably going to be
really expensive to buy a huge fully
equipped studio complete with shoe
squeak microphones same as it&#39;s probably
going to be quite troublesome trying to
record 30 students in a room or with
motion capture suits on so if we can
create relationships with organizations
both organizations who currently train
actors for the video game performance
medium and ones who currently work in
the industry centroid 3d is one of many
examples then the actor could get
experience in the studio and maybe even
employment and the studio get access to
a fresh exciting pool of talent and of
course not forgetting the organization&#39;s
who are creating and developing these
amazing pieces of technology the mocap
suits the microphones the facial cams
now we have virtual reality gear it&#39;s an
extensive list but by creating a mutual
relationship the actors could help shape
the next generation of Technology and
the creators and developers of the
technology could shape it around the
next generation of actors thus the next
generation of care
is one built from a foundation of
collaboration now these are just a few
initial ideas so a hugely complex
subject matter but we should continue to
think about it together and not just as
actors or gamers you see the video game
industry will continue to grow it&#39;s an
incredible opportunity of employment for
actors but it&#39;s also a medium that
allows us to continue doing what we love
as human beings telling stories as I&#39;ve
said a comfortable actor means a natural
performance and that means characters
that go down in modern gaming history
amongst the likes of Joel and Ellie from
the Last of Us Nathan Drake from the
Uncharted series Geralt from The Witcher
series Dante from Devil May Cry Ezio
from Assassin&#39;s Creed Master Chief from
Halo all character-driven series the
character is the heart and soul of these
games and it&#39;s the thing that we as
gamers can&#39;t get enough of the actor is
a huge part of giving that heart a beat
and so we should be able to help them
and provide them with the tools to be
able to keep doing so it&#39;s time that
video game performance was on the
syllabus it&#39;s time that we considered it
to be a legitimate and contemporary form
of the at Racal art because that is what
it is now for those of us who aren&#39;t
actors and gamers the technology will
still continue to develop and much like
our continuing love of phones and
tablets it will affect most parts of our
lives beyond just gaming if technology
continues to transform the way it has
well soon we will need to completely
redress both what we mean by and how we
construct character in a digital age be
a part of that dialogue thank you
you
