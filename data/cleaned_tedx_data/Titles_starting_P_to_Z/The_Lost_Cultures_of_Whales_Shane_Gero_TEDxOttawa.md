most of the ocean is dark it&#39;s a
darkness so deep that only three people
have ever reached its end is the
darkness so vast that it covers the
world&#39;s longest mountain range and its
grandest canyons it&#39;s an elusive dark
that covers most of our planet we have
put people on the moon and robots on
Mars but the deepest parts of our
world&#39;s oceans where the sperm whales
make their home are still mostly a
mystery in 2005 I started the Dominica
sperm whale project and over the last 14
years I&#39;ve literally spent thousands of
hours in the company of sperm whale
families it&#39;s really been the first time
that anyone&#39;s come to know these
biblical leviathans as individuals with
personalities as brothers and sisters
and mothers and babysitter&#39;s let me
introduce you to enigma I followed
enigmas family since before he was born
I watched him nurse from his mom and
play with his cousins
I watched him dive deeply with his
mother for the very first time when
enigma was born he was three meters long
in a metric ton you know average for a
sperm whale but in about 25 years time
when enigma is fully grown he&#39;ll be as
long as two school buses and weigh as
much as ten of them the male sperm whale
is one of the largest animals on the
planet he will become Moby Dick and when
his mom Mysterio makes deep dives she&#39;s
one of the longest and deepest divers on
the planet she can hold her breath for
over an hour and make dives as three
times as deep as a modern nuclear attack
submarine most of her life will be spent
in the darkness of the deep ocean and
only ten minutes out of every hour will
be spent in the part of the ocean that
the light touches as a result her
world is a world of sound and just like
that sperm whales have evolved a system
of echolocation to see in the dark
her unique nose has evolved as the most
powerful natural sonar system on the
planet she uses it to dive deeply into
the ocean to hunt for squid and as a
result is a significant part of the
ocean ecosystem globally
sperm whales remove as much biomass from
the ocean as all of humanity&#39;s fisheries
combined but enigma is still young and
so he&#39;ll stay at the surface next to my
boat while his aunt pinchy is up at the
surface giving milk to his younger
cousin tweak sperm whale society is
matrilineal its grandmother&#39;s mothers
and daughters who live together for life
caring for each other and defending
their family family is critical to
survival in the vast darkness of the
open ocean all that they have is each
other
pinchy tweak Kwazii scar fingers digit
Mysterio and enigma these are all
animals in a family that I&#39;ve called the
group of seven we give them names mostly
based on physical characteristics that
allow us to recognize them fingers got
her moniker because early on she had two
marks on her right fluke that looked
like she was giving the peace sign so
some of these names seem pretty flippant
but we don&#39;t give them these names
lightly it makes an important point
about individual identity these animals
are not interchangeable pinchy is not
fingers and when one of them dies all of
them who knew her will be affected and
when one is born it&#39;s a cause for
celebration the group of seven is the
best-studied family of sperm whales in
the world and they&#39;ve taught me all the
minutiae of life as a family in the open
ocean
they live rich and complex lives in part
of the world that we find difficult to
even explore it&#39;s a community of
neighboring families that is really a
multicultural oceanic society behavior
is what you do but culture is how you do
it
sperm whales are all sperm whales they
do the same thing so they feed they dive
they swim they defend their babies but
how they do it is different just like
some humans have learned to eat with
forks and other humans have learned to
eat with chopsticks
sperm whales differ in how they eat what
they eat where they roam how far they
roam their social behavior and probably
a whole bunch of cultural ways we don&#39;t
understand yet and they appear to
identify these cultures with distinct
dialects distinct sets of kotas every
family that speaks the same dialect we
call a clan the group of seven belongs
to the Eastern Caribbean clan and in the
Eastern Caribbean they use about 22
different Kota patterns one to recognize
individuals another set to recognize the
families and one unique one that they
use to mark their cultural clan every
whale in the Eastern Caribbean makes the
one plus one plus three Kota it&#39;s unique
to them it&#39;s only ever being recorded in
the Caribbean and it&#39;s been identical
for the last thirty years it takes a
newborn about two or three years to
learn to make it right they&#39;ll actually
babble and make a whole bunch of
different sounds before learning to make
these calls accurately and they need to
make it right because they need to be
able to make their cultural clan where
they belong
recognizable across these huge
Geographic scales that these animals
exist across
when two families of sperm whales meet
at sea they need to be able to recognize
each other
because it turns out that families that
speak the same dialect families from the
same clan will spend time together and
families that speak a different dialect
from different clans will not now these
whale cultures aren&#39;t trivial they&#39;re
part of their identity
just as my heritage is a part of my
identity where I come from makes up so
much of Who I am and who I am to find so
much of what I will do unfortunately as
a result of climate change and human
impacts this clan that lives so near the
islands so near to us is at risk there&#39;s
less than 300 animals left in the
Caribbean clan and one in three babies
born off Dominica will not make it till
their first birthday
April 3rd 2010 that&#39;s the last day I saw
a nigga alive the group of seven is now
only 3 pinchy fingers and her new calf
digit and in 2015 digit got rope tied
around her tail she was only 4 she
doesn&#39;t dive deeply anymore and she&#39;s
struggling to survive fingers has had to
start nursing her again every calf
counts especially when families are so
small if these families are going to
perpetuate themselves they need to make
sure that every calf survives and that&#39;s
just not happening every year when I
leave I wonder which one of these
newborn calves I won&#39;t see again every
year when I come home from the ocean
I wonder which whale I know so well
we&#39;ll be gone losing individual animals
that you know so
well has been a tragedy for me and faced
with this new reality I&#39;ve asked myself
two questions why why are they dying and
the answer is it&#39;s us it&#39;s all of us
whales get hit by the ever-growing
ever-faster ever larger ever omnipresent
shipping fleet that brings us the
economy from the around the world pinchy
was hit in 2010 but she&#39;s a lucky one
she survived but she still has the scars
to remind her everyday and in her world
of sound
I wonder how fearful she is of the
ever-present ship noise whales are also
entangled in our fishing gear entangled
to the extent that the ropes cut into
their flesh digit has been toeing around
this rope for over two years she&#39;s only
six I have a five year old at home it&#39;s
hard not to think about how a chronic
injury like this would affect the whole
dynamic of my family this brat this rope
creates substantial amounts of drag and
that drag is going to exhaust her and as
she grows the rope that&#39;s tied around
her tail will cinch it off it&#39;s hard on
a night like tonight that&#39;s so exciting
it&#39;s easy really to forget that they&#39;re
out there struggling and nursing and
living their lives go on in parallel to
ours mostly unnoticed and the worst
thing that we&#39;ve ever done to the
citizens of the ocean is to have ignored
them
we&#39;ve been killing whales for hundreds
of years but we do so now out of
ignorance rather than intent and if
we&#39;re going to change that we need to be
able to speak with authority about
what&#39;s going on out there in the world
and then question those who have the
authority to make real changes in the
way that we interact with our oceans but
the second
question isn&#39;t even heavier one and
critically important what happens when
they&#39;re all gone what do we lose when we
lose an entire whale culture and I don&#39;t
think that&#39;s a question that we&#39;ve
answered for ourselves for humanity for
our own cultures for our own identities
what is lost when we lose a way of life
every culture whale or otherwise is a
set of solutions on how to survive the
environment in which we live if we lose
a culture we lose all of the traditional
knowledge of how to succeed and we can&#39;t
necessarily get that back even if the
global population of sperm whales could
move back into the Caribbean they would
be other whales from elsewhere who do
things differently and there&#39;s no saying
that they would survive there&#39;s no
saying that they would succeed and
that&#39;s an important point about
conservation if we&#39;re going to protect
species we need to define biodiversity
to include the definition of cultural
diversity
sperm whales have been sperm whales for
longer than we&#39;ve been walking upright
their societies have been are far older
than our societies and one of the
reasons that they succeed is their
cultural solutions traditionally we&#39;ve
managed wildlife around the world using
genetics stocks but genetics can&#39;t
preserve the diversity of life the
diversity in a sperm whale life is in
their cultural traditions just as it is
in our own their cultural stories are
simple love your mom learn from your
grandmother&#39;s experiences be a good
neighbor care for each other respect
different solutions to everyday problems
and share the burden of your day by
working together
if I&#39;ve learned one thing from spending
time in the culture of Wales it&#39;s the
power of community life is about the
quality of the relationships we build
with those of us those around us and
this is our community and most of it is
ocean in the darkness of the hardest
times communities come together to
overcome unimaginable obstacles and
these problems are huge they&#39;re on a
global scale and I don&#39;t have the answer
to everything but know that we&#39;re making
progress know that your small acts of
kindness and empathy can save whole
lives know that with every birth of a
new sperm whale calf it gives me hope
for the next generation so I&#39;m here not
to let us remain immune to the suffering
that these whales are going through to
not allow us to be ignorant of the
damage that we caused to parts of the
world that we don&#39;t often see but I&#39;m
also here to celebrate them the beauty
and magnificence of a sperm whale how
amazing their life&#39;s are if we can find
such deep similarities between the life
of a sperm whale and our own lives
between their values and our values how
different can we all be we need to come
together and learn from each other to
live together on this shared planet we
need to respect all people and all
species if we&#39;re going to preserve life
ours and theirs
we need to coexist both above and below
the surface we need to value cultural
diversity in our societies and the
ecosystem but if I&#39;m going to build this
new global community I can&#39;t do it alone
so I&#39;m counting on you thank you
