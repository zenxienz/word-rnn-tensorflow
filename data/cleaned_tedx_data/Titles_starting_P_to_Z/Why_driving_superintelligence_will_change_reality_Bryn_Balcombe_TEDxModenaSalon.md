good evening when I was 17 years old I
crashed my first car I tipped it upside
down on a country road it was my first
experience of black ice nine other cars
crashed on the same piece of road that
evening but both of those are just
excuses I&#39;d become a statistic that one
event has shaped my life is driven my
passion which is to understand driving
ability and how to protect against
failure it&#39;s one of the most important
things that we need to do in society
learning to learn has become important
for machines but it&#39;s important for
humans too so I learned to drive again I
went to the same school as Allen procced
and Damon Hill I then transfer that
learning to skeleton bobsleigh I slid on
Olympic grade tracks and learnt to use
my body as a sensor and as a control
system in skeleton the sled becomes an
extension to your body the car becomes a
complex exoskeleton you need to have a
very good model in your head before you
can control the car correctly horses and
humans collaborate together two forms of
intelligence two skeletons combined you
see the same in motorsport with a
spotter assisting a NASCAR driver a
co-driver assisting a rally driver and a
passenger assisting a sidecar rider
driving intelligence has become
has reached really its hype cycle now at
the top of the hype cycle now we have
self-driving cars coming to our roads so
the automobile has finally arrived but
are we all destined some passengers or
is there a different future for us in
2012 Chris Gerdes gave a talk the future
racecar 150 mile an hour and no driver
what you see here is robo car we brought
that to the streets of Paris with Robo
race earlier this year so five years max
Verstappen took 17 years to go from a
child to the Formula One youngest
Formula One driver it&#39;s an incredible
feat but how long will it take an AI
driver to take a car to that level of
performance and really is racing the
right environment to train irn if you
think our roads are much more complex
than racetracks
they include objects of all sizes they
come at you from all directions the
traffic scenes are complex they include
the unexpected so naman comes very close
to complexity that we&#39;re talking about
here 60 cars on the track 180 different
drivers each with their own personality
each with their own driving styles
coping with traffic is critical
otherwise you make mistakes like this
but motorsport has now reached the
limits of the human brain not the
cognitive limits but the safety limits
the impact limits safety is critical in
motorsport it dominates the sport yet in
most motorsport advanced driver
assistance systems are banned motorsport
has lost its relevance to the road
industry racing incidents are sometimes
no more than lack of situational
awareness and there are no systems
inside the car to us to help the driver
just the wing mirrors in this day and
age it&#39;s kind of crazy
so when Stanford run their autonomous
car up Pikes Peak every inch of the 12.4
mile hill was clear every one of the 156
turns taken on the optimal racing line
so now we&#39;re ready for a new challenge a
challenge that pushes the boundaries of
cognition of human intelligence
challenges that will see competition on
the real roads and by real roads we mean
freeways motorways rural roads urban
roads mountain roads roads that are
filled with autonomous traffic like
trucks buses cars vans motorcycles fully
autonomous traffic that cars have to
race through to really push the limits
of intelligence within our vehicles of
the future to drive that innovation that
we need in the technology that will keep
us safe on the roads
so imagine Pikes Peak but filled with
traffic imagine a competition where it&#39;s
more about cognitive power rather than
mechanic
power how intelligent you are how you
manage risk how you avoid incidents
imagine any movie car chase you Venice
scene or computer game you may have
played we&#39;re starting to see reality
converge and we&#39;re bringing these things
to life with Robo race but wait all of
this technology and motorsport where&#39;s
the human element won&#39;t technology just
kill motorsport completely is that
really what we want to see I think in
fact the opposite is true historical
racing drivers will be brought back to
life
they&#39;ll be encoded in the software that
races the cars they&#39;ll wind and then
you&#39;ll download their software into your
car as an intelligent co-driver or race
day trainer real humans too will compete
but connected remotely to the Robo cars
in full motion simulators humans will be
able to demonstrate their skill in
combining with AI showing how they can
judge situations better than I aya now
you have two cars head-to-head one full
AI one powered by a human it&#39;s society&#39;s
bigger biggest battle human versus AI
it&#39;s the competition we all want to see
it&#39;s the competition we&#39;ve seen in chess
but it&#39;s not a fair competition
computers have access to the control
system to the car much more advanced
than humans do humans are constrained by
the mechanical legacy of an 1800s design
the steering wheel the throttle and the
brake well they&#39;re just like the
keyboard they were designed
a long time ago before we move to their
electronic systems future systems future
human machine interaction will be haptic
whole-body and as we heard earlier even
facial the communication of both emotion
and intent our visual and auditory
systems will be augmented with data data
that&#39;s come from machines but that
humans interpret that we use in order to
guide the vehicle and make better
decisions so we&#39;re not replacing the
human intelligence can actually enhance
our human capabilities so brain computer
interfaces is really the next step with
this the computer so the wetware the
hardware and the software will combine
to produce a unique super intelligence
it will give us capabilities that we&#39;ve
never had before
it will enhance AI beyond where III can
go at the moment and that&#39;s really
important the competition formats that
we&#39;re looking at will actually ensure
that humans have always kept safe but
we&#39;re able to drive innovation in the
cars that will keep you safe on the
roads as well so mobility is freedom in
the future these systems should enhance
that mobility enhance our freedoms they
shouldn&#39;t contain us motorsport is
evolving driving super intelligence will
change your reality so I suggest we all
buckle up because the future is coming
faster than you can think thank you very
much
