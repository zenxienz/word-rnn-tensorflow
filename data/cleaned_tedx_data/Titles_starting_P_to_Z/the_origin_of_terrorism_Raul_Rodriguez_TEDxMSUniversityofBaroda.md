so when we talk about tourism which is
my area of expertise in spite of
everything his mastery so far if you
look at the 3rd of June 2017 London and
during Italy respectively well there is
the image of how humanity as giving up
to terrorism now working for Interpol as
a criminal in that his analyst my job is
gonna light it it&#39;s a freaking boring
your opportunity you can see numbers in
database all the time but when you
because they apply to social research
this work we see what we see is how this
around early Europe and the whole world
has given up to the tourism when you see
a lot of rich of that for the most part
of the word about it
you know what happened in the breach
weapon there he was the tween the
business conform to any business
whatever media has told you so far you
can believe it or not have to do to the
videos conform about that people what
people did defending yourself
they just went running with the hands of
the heads because on the command a
policeman they went under tables to the
rest now I for eight years you can call
themselves information you can call that
or whether you wanna call it cowardice
that&#39;s what it is
you&#39;re not doing we understand that law
reform in understand the population in
the population are not trained in skewed
at times to do so but does it mean that
you don&#39;t collect at courage when you
should and putting power the same thing
happen during the Juventus were clubs
playing the sound of a firecracker it&#39;s
a bit of people run a bar and they
killed thousands of them now this is
basically what is the grounded in euros
lat if you don&#39;t want to know what you
will do
because he was personating satiric
empathy towards people from the country
Mountains from the South depends house
for maybe in the mushrooms you can so so
the time security forces and law
enforcement the Romanian tax language
and many should be thankful that we are
there to prevent attack because
otherwise you have been many other
catastrophes but they don&#39;t love us with
reception of the bedrooms because there
are things we current that point
including the politicians who many are
involved in this kind of activities as
well does anyone do you know what this
is like what New York yeah the Moriya
Reporting Center 9/11 so and if so many
of you might remember when you were on
the 9/11 or might not but instead to
recover but you were under many
different sensations I was nice of all
CNN activities when directed to the 9/11
of that no one spoke about thirty two
billion dollars
before but that&#39;s ok because it&#39;s much
more important of course people tell me
for the nose and with this happen you
just pursue the whole war is under
attack then always in every movie they
put it forward they were under attack
means New York they want them to be all
that you not the state map that&#39;s how it
works
did you see today&#39;s superheroes are in
modern marvel movies
I wonder how however they don&#39;t grass in
New York because they&#39;re all together in
the same place so I&#39;m pretty sure
everything comes comfortable that
including the terrorism activities with
this point you can Mumbai as well Mumbai
was fascinating 10 people in a city of
22 million people so it seems like a
good treasure to me because thank you
million is very buttons using it like
you have two police officers pertaining
occurred who were actually trained
prevent attacks and then four of them
were killed in the same guy seems like a
bit made up to me the same because you
know when people are trained for
Britain&#39;s camp activities
you don&#39;t really die in the first
instance one can be 1947 because you
have trained to render captivity as well
if you look at the footage installation
which is now centered practice
environment perhaps whatever now
developers footage and you see how
people go running under the day was a
game they were not tables have done
together under the colors are under the
name perhaps this is what context to
explain this is what everyone looks like
another war and this is fascinating
because that by God you make our job
much much more difficult because you are
creating it they are winning they are
laughing at that you&#39;re actually
promoting an activity is you with the
skirt the way as simple as that
and you don&#39;t go against and if you look
at the many living if he ever happened
they would have passengers aircraft
which is not a total form if two people
to 30 people telling me to stop two
people in an aircraft he said still to
you there is no exit no forget about it
of course to go on get but if you don&#39;t
do so what I really love to do you
consider service is missing on the world
people give up it from my side I find
fascinating and there&#39;s no I should be
working very relevant to us because it
was a very huge difference a ratio 10 to
22 million it&#39;s a very huge populated
city I&#39;m still no one did anything about
it
I mean you can maintain that&#39;s what L
with thank you for this and no one will
realize do you think it&#39;s a small few
like this stuff very heavy you cannot
just go a name with it there are
security checks but of course they
happen or they didn&#39;t want it to happen
there now as my W in theta
after all I won&#39;t show you the service
from the a meta anyways no good without
in Subic a terrorist nonsense the
consideration of of death is minimal the
sweater team is overrated
develops care about terrorism and
terrorism is very fast frightening and
you cannot go to Saudi Arabia to Dubai
and because you know what did not happen
of course a boil vanished and Mysteria
they&#39;re very bad countries not at all
tourism look at the nor&#39;easter that you
see that air of general orange line is
more one below the grain that is the
recent deaths we to look at the big or
next one that&#39;s diabetes did you look at
the great one to start again shops
no more martyrs and you look at road
accident blue one now I read is the
reason to you because to be
insignificant in a car sky this actually
the ratio in fact is that you have today
about the reason tourism is one to two
new million changes you have that you
can collapse
9 mm in the bathtub many fire 199th up
by lightning which is very improperly
still but is one to five million four
hundred thousand so translating this to
you
in five years you&#39;re more likely to be
nervous okay
being scared of it mean you can&#39;t keep
just relying on one for my agencies to
protect you but then you forget that we
want you to protect you want it to
prepare attacks to happen now if you
have to protect 22 million people just
in Mumbai police for example to protect
to you too many people until make sure
after you hear that they don&#39;t have 2
million people to protect you to protect
each other
it&#39;s enviable cannot go forward you have
to lend as well but we cannot say okay
this is very very general is no
lightning Jerusalem okay let&#39;s look at
three countries which work in different
perspectives Syria which is all wasting
words is the less than they remember
India which were seeing auras in work
here and there are the time a beautiful
bus-sized the country is not that
significant statistically eyespace
considered a developed country since
1975 after
democracy more ways we can say under the
doctrine was the next country now 14
Syria around 18 million the primary
cause of death of course war which
represents almost half of it and you
look at secondary course diabetes which
is minimum so would witness a huge vast
amount of that but you look at India
because almost 1.3 billion in 2014 the
main cause of death is coronary heart
disease and the second one and conflict
of course this comes in the picture
because made
the mother time there are many companies
coming in they&#39;re all over and they go
point by point but it&#39;s speaking is only
two perfectly six percent because of
that and then you go to Spain who is
better leave 47 million and you look at
the behind on disease rate is 30% 30%
and you look Adam conflict 1.5 now this
might seem to be more in the W but the
Juventus hand picking on this social
running deal develop support them in
love countries they have a more
distributed cause of death than those
which are not so so-called the below as
well you can in here it takes more
recognized at the system square but in
this very huge country so then under for
police you must replace is that I&#39;m
serious of course as out rated on that
point because war is just running the
country companies many many heinous now
before I conclude with this including
this question before that wonder exactly
because you see 2026 you levels well and
you see constant happening attacks in
translator setting other areas of
Indians out of this asia-pacific
you should wonders have a voice behind
them because it&#39;s very easy to see media
and just what&#39;s the use of it by as a
newspapers you saying it&#39;s better being
all the newspapers and TV channels
broadcast media I completely biased
fully bias like I said the remember they
get paid to promote near some to great
don&#39;t forget about that yes this point
in mind is poor deleted a 9/11 happened
to then before pentominoes a huge amount
of money and on the 9/11 conserve what
that supposed plane hit the Pentagon
no I see news is to be camera recorded
that are you telling me is the most
secure building on earth with more
256 around the building couldn&#39;t record
an aircraft crashing on the building a
lady will disperse them well second
estrogen is done for you and for society
because we&#39;re living it or not it will
end up into the face at some point thank
you
[Applause]
