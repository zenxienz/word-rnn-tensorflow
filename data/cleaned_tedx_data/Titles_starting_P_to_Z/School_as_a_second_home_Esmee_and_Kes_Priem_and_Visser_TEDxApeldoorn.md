when I was staying years old I already
knew that I would choose the father&#39;s
glacier I knew it when I performed when
my sister performed at first I&#39;d still
remember that I noticed that the school
was so bright and so colorful that I
just couldn&#39;t believe that it really was
a school there were no separated
classrooms and it was all open and
connected to each other immediately it
felt like home and I realized that this
school is the perfect school for me but
then I wasn&#39;t accepted I was enamored
Rihanna 36 but only 200 students were
admitted I was so upset I remember it as
if it was yesterday because it was
convinced that this school was the
perfect place for me for this reason I
had done everything to be admitted I
emailed and not once with like a
thousand times even with the dudas
officer and my father called every week
to check if perhaps there&#39;s a little
place for me and eventually finally I
was accepted I have more luck I was
number 42 which meant that I had a spot
for sure at first which was a great
relief because I really wanted to go to
the school why I was so sure about my
choice in seventh grade I
unintentionally went to an open day with
a friend and I felt so at home I knew
this was the school for me
so even when I went to look at other
schools there was no doubt about where I
wanted to go fathers felt right so that
was where where I was going to go being
able to feel at home at school is
something that as May and I find it very
important
not just because he spent most of your
time at school but because this is the
place we learn change and grow you go
through your ups
and your downs and that makes you
vulnerable but if you feel at home then
it&#39;s okay and if you&#39;re vulnerable you
can really look at yourself and what
kind of person you are and you will see
what you&#39;re good at and what you&#39;re not
so good at for example I found English
very hard and I wanted to change that so
I asked my parents and teachers for help
at our school it&#39;s very normal to just
step up to teacher and ask for help they
even want and expect you to so because I
make myself vulnerable and asked for
help I received extra exercises and tips
and because of that help and now I&#39;ve
got a nine point six my 3-piece exam
which I&#39;m really proud of I got to know
myself better but it took a little time
before I was open to that I experienced
something that made me close my doors
but now that they&#39;re open and learn new
things about myself all the time and
sometimes that&#39;s good other times not so
much but because of the safety at our
school it&#39;s okay to have to good and
they&#39;re not so good five five times a
week I&#39;m on the fully booked or I play
volleyball and beach football at a high
level my dream is to participate in
Olympic Games in 2028 my school helps
supports and contributes me to achieve
my dreams I get every opportunity to go
to trainings tournaments and matches but
that&#39;s the only reason my school helps
me to learn more skills which are very
important for my top sport at father&#39;s
we work with I self this contains four
skills three of them are work together
reflect and they control yourself and I
use all these skills in volleyball
work together for example with fully
value our team you win and you lose
together at my school collaboration is
stimulated by working on projects in
groups this takes place in so called
learning houses these are very big
spaces where four classes of different
learning years are in the same classroom
and yes and here you work together or by
yourself that&#39;s your choice and yes
sometimes you have to work with thumbs
with someone you don&#39;t like so much but
then you have to adjust and help each
other and together it always works
students often receive feedback from
other students or teachers which they
can use to learn from their mistakes it
sometimes you have to write an
evaluation to reflect on your process of
the period what did you learn what was
difficult and what are your goals for
the next assignment with volleyball you
have to improve every time again and
again to become better but especially to
accomplish your dreams to take and to
take control of yourself means ownership
of your own learning process you decide
what you do and when and whether you do
it be able to plan well is fundamental
for this and certainly for me because
combining volleyball with my study it&#39;s
a big change sometimes and requires not
only perseverance and discipline but
also responsibility and yes it&#39;s hard at
some moments and it can go wrong but at
my school there&#39;s plenty opportunity to
learn fall and stand up again I have to
do the work nobody else does it for me I
am responsible for my future
I want to learn I want to grow and I
want to create a good career it&#39;s my
responsibility not yours I often say
never give up make the best of the worse
that&#39;s what we learn as fought worst we
receive education that challenge and
occurrences we are so much more than
numbers and figures we may try out
discover a love celebrates make mistakes
and yes sometimes cry did it all makes
me more it&#39;s may concerning house for my
first class I say hi to a few people go
sit next to a friend and get to work
everyone sits what I want and they don&#39;t
care about you do or where there are no
odd looks or gossip maybe it&#39;s odd that
I find this peculiar but I know from my
own experience that this can be
different in sixth grade of primary
school I was bullied and I can&#39;t
remember a day in which I truly felt
like myself I wasn&#39;t verbally or
physically abused but I was excluded
which may have been worse because my
friends my best friends for over three
years didn&#39;t want to meet up after
school anymore even though they had time
and that hurt because it always made me
doubt whether or not something was cool
enough to be liked so when I just
started at first I found it really
important that I had popular friends not
if they would become good friends or if
I could be myself with them so in the
first two introduction weeks and fathers
in which you get to know your class I
became friends with the popular kids
until I realized I didn&#39;t like them the
conversations that we had didn&#39;t
interest me and my comments were met
with that uncomfortable silence in which
no one knows what to say
so I found different friends friends I
could be myself with with my dorky
Kirksey no at first I can be myself and
feel safe and this is what I find very
important and I know that others feel
the same we create the safe atmosphere
together not just the students but also
the teachers at first everyone is equal
you can call your teachers by their
first name and you can always go to them
either for advice or if you have advice
for them and I know that there are some
people who don&#39;t find this equality
fitting for a school that it shows a
lack of respect but would I show you as
mine more respect if I call her head
master caster no I don&#39;t think so it is
because I can call her as mine that I
feel that I&#39;m important to her and that
I can give her my opinion about anything
at first we don&#39;t believe that you show
respect with the way you call someone
but with the way you treat someone
contact from person to person when I for
differences for example when I had a
header ID to improve the school it was
possible to go to just mine our
headmaster so easily
she was completely open to my ideas and
visions and we even elaborated on them
then you really feel importance you feel
of great significance or failure and
that you are not just one of thousands a
number and here I stand today
representing my school obviously a
little nervous with especially with
confidence
I am also graduating in drama class and
this is unique in the Netherlands why I
wonder because it&#39;s so important that
you learn not only with your head but
also with your heart and your hands it&#39;s
I made a journey for my young girl to a
mature woman i right now I am attending
the last year of secondary education and
I feel like I&#39;m ready and prepared for
the next step in my life and of course
it&#39;s great that I will possess my
diploma but admit it it&#39;s even better
that I feel like I&#39;m ready for life next
year I am going to America with a
scholarship where I will combine fully
Bao and my study and I&#39;m already so
excited
just bring it on being able to be
yourself is something you don&#39;t always
realize the importance of but if someone
would tell me I could never read a book
again and if someone would tell me that
I may never play volleyball again then
we will not accept it we have learned
who we are what we can and who we want
to be and we&#39;re proud of that and if
there&#39;s one thing you want you to
remember it is this it doesn&#39;t matter
where you are at school at work or at
home the place where you learn perform
and grow is the place where you should
feel safe and where you can be yourself
