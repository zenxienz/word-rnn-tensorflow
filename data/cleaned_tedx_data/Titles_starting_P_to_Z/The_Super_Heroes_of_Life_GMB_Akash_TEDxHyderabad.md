I thank you for giving me this
opportunity to present my work to here
I&#39;m also grateful to those incredible
people who have let me take their photos
any stories for last 20 years because of
the stories and photos I&#39;m here today
for last 20 years I have been always
interested in the people who are living
on the edge of the society I have been
criticized for my work almost every day
people question my morals when I take
pictures of gay community sex workers
and poor they say I&#39;m selling poverty
but that was not my intention I wanted
to show the things that need to be
changed positively I wanted to be a
voice for those who have no voice and
last 20 years I have been working on the
issue that was really really
undiscovered when I I was working people
did not know about them I did a lot of
work our sex workers in Bangladesh there
are a lot of lot of young sex workers
who are working in different kind of in
different bottles in Bangladesh and they
have been given over to extent by their
Madam&#39;s a lot of discolor girls they
were they were sold by the stepfather or
a stepmother or sold by her husband or
boyfriend or somebody told them that
come with me I&#39;ll give you a job in a
textile factory in Dhaka and they bring
them these girls and sold them in the
inside the brothel and these both help
people they give them overall red cell
which is comforting tablet which is very
dangerous medicine which to look them
older and and fat and sometimes these
girls get really really really depressed
and they want to hurt them she was she
was cutting her hand and I was there for
months after months I usually I choose
one papac&#39;s and I work for a long time I
just don&#39;t I just don&#39;t go there and
take photos I I go there with or without
my camera I talk to them I explain what
why I am there what I&#39;m doing when they
stop trusting me then I start taking
photos so it takes long times and I
become one of them when I was working
with sex worker people was laughing at
me they say that
I have problem with my current
characters when I was working with gay
community they think I&#39;m a gay and when
I was working with poor people they say
that I&#39;m selling poverty and that was
always something like that
Lisa hue has been sold in this bottle
when she was very young age now she goes
she become older and suddenly she become
emotional that she has nobody nobody
take care of her she was she was crying
and the situation is really really bad
there Rana Plaza that are the biggest
textile factory call-ups a few years
back in Bangladesh and a lot of lot of
lot of worker died more than thousands
worker died there a lot of lot of a lot
of people they even did not get a dead
body this was one of the biggest
disaster in Bangladesh garment industry
and family still who they are they they
cry for their for the family members law
lot of worker they lost their hands and
legs there is a lot of stories that that
was untold and I really wanted to bring
this his stories in front of people I
wanted to bring more light on this
issues the petrol bomb attacks on public
transportation took hundreds of people
live in Bangladesh including Kilian the
situation was really a lows and as a
photographer you know when you are going
there you are taking all these stories
and you have to carry all these stories
with you all life sometimes these
stories make you really really upset and
sad make you really depressed you cannot
forget I I still remember there
voyageurs you know I I hear there III
remember their stories I have a Facebook
page where I have more than 500,000
people followers there and I I try to
post every day one story with one image
the incredible stories heartbreaking
story inspiring stories and I receive
almost hundreds of meals every day from
all around the world that how this story
is changed their life how this stories
and photos influencing them to change
their perspective to think how fortunate
they are and they start doing so many
things that they did never did before
even they start eating thanks
before they never did it so he&#39;s in
anyway the stories of these people
they&#39;re inspiring to make people a tell
and I was in Pakistan and she I was
taking picture of ship breaking yard
this post of the people from Peshawar
they&#39;re working really hard they do
everything here with hand they don&#39;t any
use any machine and they get really
really very low paid in Bangladesh lot
of people they go they write on the
chain rule because they don&#39;t in to pay
they cannot afford to go inside the
chain even is very little money but they
they cannot able to pay so there is
their life and they go on the chain of
chain roof and sometimes they they write
they take a ride on the middle of the
two compartment and I was I was there
with her in the same position I was just
her opposite it was very very fear and
it was it was really dangerous it was
really dangerous I was top of the chain
several time they they do it every day
they know that when the key is coming
but I did not know in the in the
beginning I was taking photos I was
standing and taking photos and train was
going back and I I got hit by the tree
several time it was not easy but I never
I never controlled myself every time I I
promise that I will never go up again
but next I went a reckoning
it&#39;s very very is very difficult to
control I do I did not work on Dalit
community in Bangladesh the Daleth has a
very different situation in Bangladesh
nobody even know that Bangladesh has
valid still yes they like to a lot of
images are just just few months back and
in some places people even don&#39;t touch
them they don&#39;t let them go inside the
shop they don&#39;t talk to them if they go
for fish they cannot sell this fish to
the market because they are tallied I
was always interested about the people
who are who have no voice you know when
we are we are we are angry we are
depressed we are sad we can tweet we can
give a status on our Facebook but these
people have no voice these people living
just beside us there here and there who
even never noticed them and that&#39;s why I
always wanted to bring their stories the
images in front of us so I was in Nepal
this is the old home for Nepal and this
it&#39;s very difficult for them even
provide fruit for twice a time to these
people the situation was really really
really really bad I was in India
Indonesia and this is a mental hospital
there they are a lot of mental patient
in Indonesia and they had they don&#39;t
have sufficient doctors and there are a
lot of private mental hospitals there
and most of the time they change their
patient they think this is the this is
the best way to make this mental people
come down and they they don&#39;t hurt
themselves I still remember you know
when I was there they were inside the
case and there was all chained and I was
inside there there and they were all the
times they were spraying there they&#39;re
calling my name
they are shouting they were singing he
still after several years I still
remember I sometimes I hear this voices
it&#39;s very difficult as a photojournalist
you have to always carry this ystos with
you I was in Greece to cover the refugee
situation just two or three years back
this family father and son they just
crossed the sea with a rubber boat and
that boat was about to sing I was always
working with these people and these
people they have very hard life
they were always struggling to survive
they have nothing nothing but they never
give up
they were always smiling I don&#39;t know
what makes them smile they never
complain
and I was really really fortunate to
meet all these people they teach me how
beautiful life is even we we are here
today we think we should thanks to God
because we made it there are hundreds of
people who are not here you know who did
not make it to her this morning so we
have to be always grateful we have to be
always always people you have to be
positive about life and but if you think
positive positive things will come to
you I&#39;ll show images and see how lucky
you are I have been working on child
level situation for last 15 years and
this boy was bitten by his owner because
he was suing a t-shirt and we were slow
and I took this photo and I won&#39;t Wall
Press Photo Award in 2006 and that being
a lot of interest a attention on this
issue and I was visiting more factories
these children have to work under very
heat and lot of noises is very difficult
to work but their parents cannot afford
to send them school they all support
they cannot earn more money so then send
the children to work and they have to
work in a very under very very did Cal
condition it took three months for me to
get inside this factory I I talked to
the owner and I&#39;ll make him understand I
make friendship with him friendship with
him then then he really understand that
I want to I don&#39;t want to stop child
ever but I want to improve the situation
and he let me inside the factory child
labor is banned since 1992 so it was not
easy to go inside this factories
sometimes I just jump into the wall and
took the photos and and come back I even
could not take the name it was not easy
all the time but you will see children
are working almost everywhere this is
small voice makes balloons and he told
me every day when he go to home he
brings some balloons for his sister
because he cannot play he cannot give
time to her so he brings everyday
balloon for him for her sister there are
lot of been interesting and inspiring
stories and children were everywhere
everywhere and they look different they
look older this young boy lost his hand
while he was working in this Factory and
when he recovered he get better he came
back to the same
today because they are there they have
nowhere to go and he did not get any
conversation from this Factory the owner
of the factory one of the factory they
like to keep children because children
cannot complain the children cannot
organize lever Union and you can pay
lace but it&#39;s very difficult the
situation is very difficult this boy was
chained by his father because he was
mingle mingle in with bad boys and start
taking drug so his father being him in
the factory he lock him in the morning
and in the afternoon when the work
finish it taking work with him to home
so he&#39;s a very critical situation I also
talked with the owner and they say we
don&#39;t want to keep the children but if
we don&#39;t take the children they will go
without food so I was really really
depressed I was really really depressed
I have received more than 100 in turn
showered my images has been published
almost all peaking newspaper like
National Geographic
Time magazine Newsweek everywhere but I
was not happy at all I really wanted to
do something for these people so I was
looking for a idea I stopped taking
photos couple of months so I started I
came up idea I will give them a small
business so they I start finding these
people again after few years later I
talked to them what kind of business
they able to do i survey on the market
and he started small business and give
them as a gift and then i monitor them
and give them training so they can they
can be successful in their business so
far i have given 50 different business
to 50 different families
Munna munis family is one of those
fifties families you see the moon as
hell it looks like 70s old man&#39;s hand
when when I took his photo he even could
not talk he was stopped he lost his
childhood
after several meeting with his parents
we came up with the idea that we really
start few camera business for his father
in Dhaka we have more than six thousand
six thousand s2 and sin taka who need
cucumber for making salad so he&#39;s a
definitely good business in few months
moon as father he starts earning more
money and he bring enough out of that
factory and after few a few months later
Munna told me hey Akash why I also want
to do something I want to do business so
I set up a pop gun business for Munna he
was selling popcorn on basi stop and
launch stop and he&#39;s changed munis life
completely you can see that a difference

children he back to the normal life and
whatever he was earning he was
supporting with thus earning his sister

cheap he was working in rickshaw pot
maker he was working on aluminium
cooking pot factory and after talking to
her mother his mother we give him women

I took her to the market where he can
buy good materials with a cheaper price
then she such going door-to-door and
selling women dress and have more better
earning there is only solution fist of
child labor you have to ensure their
parents are earning more money I start
working on misty children more than 3.2
million children are living on his teeth
in Bangladesh and other are big cities
in Bangladesh and most of them they&#39;re
addicted to drug or involved with
illegal activities and I really wanted
to do something I found this three the
children they were fresh and they really
wanted to change the life so after after
several meeting with them I make them
understand who I am what I am
to explain them I want to give them
business rather than living on a state
they should have dignity and they start
trusting me so when I made them they
were all dirty they even did not take
shower for a long time so I took them in
