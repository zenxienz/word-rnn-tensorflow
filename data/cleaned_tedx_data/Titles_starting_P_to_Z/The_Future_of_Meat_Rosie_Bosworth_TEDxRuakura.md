we humans love to romanticize things
take love for example we love to paint
images and now here around just how
amazing falling in love errs of sailing
off into the Sun setting horizon with
our mythical prince charming starstruck
by those teenage euphoric butterfly
feelings that come with meeting our mr.
or mrs. right convincing ourselves that
having the dream home dream man that
white picket fence will somehow
transform our lives into one of endless
euphoria why because we humans like to
feel good even if there&#39;s romantic fairy
tale stories shaping our very
perceptions of happiness a merely
mythical social contract starkly
divorced from reality and it&#39;s no
different for food when you think about
that last meal you ate last night&#39;s
chicken curry
this morning&#39;s berry breakfast smoothie
or perhaps last weekend&#39;s drunken greasy
hangover burger we tend to want to
convince ourselves that where our food
came from and what was involved in
getting it affordably to our plates all
came from a happy place or a healthy
animal from a happy Daisy the cow
roaming the fields with her young nearby
a spring leaping lamb or a happy hen
frolicking in the wild outdoors just so
lovingly cared for by trusted Harry the
farmer and their vegetarian quinoa salad
you so virtuously ate last week well
that was grown in the most
environmentally friendly conditions no
toxic nasties in sight and the
environment completely unharmed in its
harvest little do we know however or at
least want to acknowledge that most of
the foods the world eats like our milk
meat chicken and eggs even seafood are
not produced in conditions like this and
nor more often than not do they remotely
even reflect anything remotely close to
these idyllic countryside fun stories
we&#39;ve been sold to buy big food in
agriculture
much like love life and that white
picket fence we tend to choose a blind
eye to the very real realities of how
our food is Purdue
store at least we choose to ignore it
when we eat it so we feel better about
ourselves if only we knew the real
realities of how our food is produced
and the enormous toll that has on the
environment our health and on animals
then our perceptions and the choices
around the foods we eat would more than
certainly change because when you peel
back the lid of Agriculture agriculture
1.0 in particular animal farming it
becomes starkly clear just how far from
romantic our modern-day global food
system has become the slaughter of
animals and the filthy chaos of an
abattoir if only we knew the toll the
18% of global greenhouse gas emissions
contributed by agriculture that&#39;s 40%
more than global transportation combined
including cars trucks planes and boats
the agriculture contributes 70% of our
freshwater use whilst been the world&#39;s
worst polluters of our waterways it
takes a mere 15,000 liters of water to
produce on average a kilo of beef and
even a New Zealand&#39;s most sustainable
and efficient of dairy farms we still
use around 250 liters of water to
produce 1 liter of milk that in many
cases of ironically gets evaporated and
sent offshore as low value commodity
milk powder we need only look at the
appalling rising levels of unswerving
and undrinkable waterways in New Zealand
thanks to the steep rise in agriculture
and dairy and the associated effluent
and fertilizer used to know that animal
agriculture really isn&#39;t that pretty and
then there&#39;s the 30 square million miles
40 percent of the world&#39;s arable land
surface the size of South America and
Africa combined cleared for livestock
using crop production mainly through
chopping down our tropical and
indigenous rainforests and then there&#39;s
the
d six billion animals slaughtered every
year often raised and inhumane
conditions pumped full of hormones and
antibiotics often crammed and
overcrowded feed Lots crammed factory
farms battery cages ridden with fecal
matter global breeding grounds for
life-threatening disease illness and
global pandemics like foot and mouth
avian flu or mad cows disease 80% of our
antibiotics worldwide are fed in the
States to farm animals potentially
assuring in an end to an era of
antibiotics working in human medicine
but even if you are completely cool with
the environmental ethical and health
impacts of the food you&#39;re currently
eating perhaps the sheer inefficiencies
of animal agriculture will have you
sitting up and listening only a fraction
of the calories we feed animals like
corn grain or pasture actually make
their way into the foods we ultimately
end up eating for every 100 calories we
feed an animal we get an abysmal 25 of
those hundred bacon eggs 20 of those
hundred back in chicken 16 in milk 15
and pork and an appalling three of beef
that&#39;s 97% waste yet all the while we
need to figure out how to feed an
increasing two billion mouths by 2050 in
developing regions like China and India
but whatever way you look at it despite
the harm it creates we humans still love
food and meat and we cannot imagine life
without it what if there was a way to
flip the script to sustainably produce
all the foods we loved the meat the
protein in a way that didn&#39;t entail a
vast machinery of misery dearth and
environmental harm to produce it a way
to produce food that could be ethically
sustainably and environmentally scaled
to feed a world of nine point six
billion people on the very fringes of
our cities a new world of agriculture
agriculture 2.0 all enabled by biology
science and technology
well this lofty food vision this new
global food paradigm is starting to
emerge and it&#39;s been driven not by the
people you&#39;d expect not by trusted Harry
the farmer with decades of knowledge of
the soil of his animals and his land but
by food renegades technologists
biologists medical doctors engineers
foodies all driven by a common goal to
turn the existing food paradigm on its
head and create a better world for all
involved thanks to science biology and
technology a new food revolution is
brewing and animals and rolling pastures
may have little to do with the future of
our milk meat chicken eggs and even
seafood these images may seem something
like out of the Jetsons or Star Wars but
they&#39;re very real and are already
starting to change the world of global
food and agriculture and a positively
profound way companies like beyond meats
and impossible foods in the United
States have designed burgers that look
cook taste drip fat and even bleed like
your traditional ground beef burger
would the only catch not a cow in sight
they are made entirely from plants no
hormones or antibiotics and are produced
at a fraction of the environmental harm
other companies like New Zealand&#39;s own
Sun fed meats the NACO or New Wave foods
in the United States
similarly designing and producing tasty
versions of chicken list chicken cow
Lola&#39;s dairy milk products and seafood
without the pillage by harnessing
technologies and plant those proteins
like pee and algae no not your ill
reputed dry gnarly tofu burger or that
effeminate soy milk substitute that the
average
waikato man in this room would be caught
dead ordering but the almost real-deal
harnessing biology technology in nature
these companies are deconstructing the
very constitutive elements of what makes
meat and protein tick like fat grease
muscle sinews the smell the taste the
texture and they&#39;re reconstructing it in
the lab using plants for example
impossible Foods uses a unique
combination of potato wheat and pea
proteins specks of coconut oil to make
sure that the burger chomps into and is
moist and drips fet like your
traditional ground beef burger and it
says crispy on the outside whilst being
moist in the middle but the real hype
behind these burgers is their ability to
bleed these companies and in particular
impossible foods have harnessed a
molecule called heme a protein typically
found in animal blood non forgiving meat
it&#39;s rare drippy savory taste and
consistency impossible has figured out
how to harness this very same molecule
in plants using soy root nodules and
they&#39;re culturing it in the lab using
yeast beyond meats is achieving a
similar bloody effect by using beetroot
juice meaning we&#39;ll always be able to
get that bloody drippy juicy taste
sensation even if we are just biting
into a bunch of plants but it&#39;s more
than just tastes that&#39;s making these
plant-based proteins all the more
game-changing plant-based proteins are
also incredibly and inherently more
efficient and more environmentally
friendly than growing animals at scale
they use up to 95% less land
seventy-five percent less water in a
mess around 87% less greenhouse gas
emissions impossible food says that by
bypassing the cow and substituting it
for a quarter pound impossible burger
you&#39;re saving the equivalent of taking a
10-minute shower that&#39;s more water per
burger than your
drinkin a couple of months you&#39;re also
freeing up a land area over of around
seven square meters a good-sized double
bedroom that can be put back to more
environmentally beneficial uses like
thumpin meats also says that you can
produce five times as much protein using
plants then growing animals like chicken
pigs or cows not only that companies
like beyond meats and some fed meats
claim to contain more nutritional
goodness too they claim to contain more
protein iron zinc and other minerals
like magnesium than traditional animal
grown products and already they&#39;re
selling at are just a fraction of the
price at our supermarket shelves small
price premium that will continue to
tumble as these companies grow in
popularity and continue to scale more no
matter how similar and look cook taste
and feel plant-based proteins are don&#39;t
you worry agriculture 2.0 has you sorted
another way cellular agriculture or
cultured foods otherwise known as lab or
clean meat a new and growing wave of
companies including finless foods
mosa meats and memphis meats are
harnessing existing technologies on the
market including genome sequencing
tissue engineering synthetic and
molecular biology to recreate animal
proteins and agricultural products like
milk meat seafood egg even lettuce but
in the lab and they look and taste and
or taste like the real deal because they
are in a process called cellular
agriculture these companies are growing
and harvesting animal cells instead of
animals only a mechanical animal has
been used to grow and harvest these
cells instead of a real living one how
well let&#39;s take meat for example we
start by taking a small harmless swab of
healthy animal cells these are then
placed in a soupy broth of nutrients we
call media that contains all the
vitamins and minerals and amino acids
that these cells need to grow and
multiply into bigger like pieces when
they&#39;ve grown and to or multiplied into
more lifelike portions they&#39;re attached
to a sponge-like structure could
scaffold which enables the meat to take
on a more lifelike 3d portions and cuts
and textures like a marbled sirloin
steak or a textured chicken or duck
breast meaning we&#39;re not just stuck with
that gooey sludgy chicken nugget goo or
uniform mincemeat scale all of this will
happen inside a bioreactor or a
fermentation tank much like beer is
brewed in a brewery and the whole
process from South swab to harvest will
take around four to six weeks depending
on the type of cut you prefer for
example if you want a more soft
succulent tender cut of meat will
harvest the meat earlier in the process
but if you want a more tough for gnarly
cut no worries we&#39;ll harvest it later in
the process when the animal sales have
had a little more time to exercise quite
literally
and much like plant-based proteins and
the cellular agriculture phenomena is
catching on most meats was the first
company to produce the world&#39;s first lab
grown paddy using beef muscle cells in
2013 other companies like much protein
and super meats and the agriculture
phenomena the amazing humble fish fish
meats was the first company Kit Carson
patty mussels in 2013 and much land
plant-based proteins more efficient
using muscle and animal farming and as
got Gail preliminary studies show that
cellular agricultural clean meat
products use up to 90% nurse land 98%
nurse water and a mesh around 84 percent
less greenhouse gas emissions but get
this
one small swab of animal cells about one
gram the size of a sesame seed is enough
to produce 10,000 kilos of beef
and the cells from the equivalent of an
entire cow or beef as inefficient than
animal farming at scale preliminary
studies show that cellular agricultural
clean meat products use up to 90 percent
less land 98% less water and a mess
around 84 percent less greenhouse gas
emissions but get this one small swab of
animal cells about one gram the size of
a sesame seed is enough to produce
10,000 kilos of beef and the cells from
the equivalent of an entire cow or beef
is enough to feed one small country its
carnivorous beef appetite for a year
calorie for calorie clean meat is also
more efficient it takes only 3 calories
of input to create a calorie of a
calorie of clean meat using Memphis
meats clean technology platform compare
that to 23 calories of grain or pasture
or corn that we feed an animal and a
feedlot or on a farm it also grows 15
times as fast it&#39;s 4 to 6 weeks to
harvest clean meat using a fermentation
tank compare that to 10 12 14 months to
feed breed and raise an animal only to
slaughter it just to cut a hunk of meat
off its side but before you start to
think it disgusting gross cellular
agriculture clean lab meat if off no way
that&#39;s just not my style
don&#39;t you worry cellular agriculture is
inherently cleaner and greener and
perhaps even more ethically produced
compared to our typical factory farmed
beef pork or chicken today and
definitely more healthier than our
highly manufactured chicken nuggets or
manufactured meat balls are not only
that some people would go on to say that
cellular agriculture is an advancement
to or more natural then some of the
foods that we&#39;re eating today
because what you see under the
microscope is exactly that clean meat
clean muscle and animal cells clean
seafood but what you don&#39;t see is the
hormones the antibiotics the fecal
matter the harm that comes at times with
growing animals in the traditional way
and they&#39;re also dropping exponentially
in price most meats and Memphis meats
aim to be on our supermarket shelves at
prices we can all afford within four to
five years
meaning the thought of chomping into
your clean meat burger may soon become a
warmly welcomed reality for us all so as
we stare down the barrel of a world that
needs to feed an extra two billion
mouths and little more than three
decades yet all the while our existing
food system has reached its
environmental ethical and social limits
it&#39;s time to rethink the way we think
about food to let go of this mythical
romantical fairy tale ideas around how
our food is produced and to welcome in a
new world of food and agriculture
agriculture 2.0 enabled by science
biology and technology to welcome in and
allow science biology and technology to
feed us all to feed and nourish us all
in a way that we humans our health the
environment and animals all thrive and
prosper these changes are coming some of
them are already here they are
incredibly exciting and I challenge and
welcome you all to be open to and hungry
for these changes thank you
[Applause]
