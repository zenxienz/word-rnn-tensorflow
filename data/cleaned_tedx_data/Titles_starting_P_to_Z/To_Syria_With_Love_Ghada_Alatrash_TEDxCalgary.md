as she drove into homes her hometown in
Syria she couldn&#39;t stop the tears from
falling and her body from shaking the
familiar neighborhoods had now become
ghost towns
once upon a time seven years ago or so
there used to be merchants roaming the
streets and shouting at the top of their
lungs are the Chokey bait engine
artichokes eggplants with crowds of
people haggling loudly and passionately
over prices there were children in the
streets racing on their bicycles filling
the place with their loud and happy
spirits ringing their bells sometimes to
warn the crowds of their presence and
sometimes simply to announce their
childhood but today today the silence
was deafening one sign of life
were the clothes hanging on clotheslines
on empty balconies vanilla scene she
thought of the days when her mother
would point to the facing balconies and
identify the neither housewife from the
messy one by the way the clothes were
arranged on the clotheslines her mother
could even tell which housewives whites
were wider than the other
there was also strict etiquette to be
followed when it came to where to place
specific clothing items undergarments
especially those that belonged to the
female in the house were to be placed on
roads that were not exposed to the
street or to facing balconies you see in
Syria in Syria clotheslines are more
than mere strings on which clothes hang
their culture and tradition their
etiquette they carry a mother&#39;s scent
and the aroma of Laurel soap they
narrate all kinds of tales about
next-door neighbors and make known who
is the tidier housewife they announced
the arrival of a baby and disclosed
whispers of wedding nights massage
affair good afternoon my name in Arabic
is pronounced Radha my identity I
identify myself as a Syrian Canadian
Syrian - Canadian I locate myself on the
- between the Syrian and the Canadian
the truth of the matter is that today
there exists a sharp dichotomy between
east and west a binary that has
succeeded to divide us into
us-versus-them discourses and rhetorics
that otherwise rhetoric that bars and
bans humans from entering national
borders noisy discourses that highlight
our differences difference is based on
what on ethnicity and religion and color
of skin mind you we are all of the same
color of
as a Vietnamese Canadian friend once
pointed out today today I hope to
highlight the similarities that we share
as humans and I hope to do this by way
of stories and I hope that my stories
will allow you to put yourselves in the
place of the other to try to understand
and to feel and listen to their hearts
for I believe that stories are keys to
opening doors and windows and hearts to
an empathetic cultural understanding
stories that can act as the signal
amidst the deafening noise stories
stories that can be those synthesizing
agents emits a desensitizing deafening
discourse stories that can restore the
human to what has been dehumanized
stories that can act a signal amidst all
the noise and today I wish to be that
bridge to Syrian hearts my bridge is
made of voices voices of hearts and
souls voices that I hope can disrupt all
the noise and I hope that as the
empathetic is tapped into activated and
turned on I hope that we can better
understand a member of the Syrian
diaspora or of any other diaspora for
that matter for these are humans who
have been yanked and uprooted from their
lands from their homelands from their
places of belonging and dispersed and
scattered in all corners of the world
not by their own choice but by a
sentence pronounced on them by F
very harsh and merciless fate let&#39;s talk
about Syria Syria is the smell of
Jasmine&#39;s serious smells of jasmine did
you know that it really does I&#39;m not
making that up a Jasmine tree to a
Syrian heart is like an olive tree to a
Palestinian and a cedar tree to a
Lebanese and a mango tree to my
Trinidadian Professors heart and a
sakura tree to a Japanese heart and a
maple tree to a Canadian heart two years
ago here in Calgary at a local
greenhouse
I bought a Jasmine tree a Jasmine plant
I bought it so that the aroma of its
white flowers can alleviate that longing
burning sensation when I think of my
homeland of Syria today and so that I
can return to the days when my father
would hold my hands as we walk the
streets of Damascus where the white
flowers climbed out of the black
railings on Syrian door gates and
stroked the space earthwise by their
charming fragrance this spring and for
the first time one of my plants but it
white flowers and those the aroma of
these flight white flowers have filled
my heart with hope and possibility for
my homeland you see to me and to many
Syrian hearts today the name Syria
embodies the fragrance of jasmine it
embodies the the aroma of Arabic coffee
mixed with cardamom
it embodies the smell of bread at dawn
in the local ovens where fathers would
line up in queues and wait to take the
hot bread that tasted like heaven to
their children
Syria is below the seal clotheslines and
these are the memories that induce the
sweetest of images for a Syrian heart
but Syria today Syria today is another
story I will read to you about Syria
through the eyes of some of the women in
my stories
word word thought of Damascus but
Damascus today was in no mood for lovers
the city&#39;s doves stopped cooing and the
white Jasmine&#39;s were dressed in black
mourning the dead Damascus children were
seeking refuge in all corner of the
corners of the world looking for a tent
in which to shelter their bare souls and
to shelter their Shivering hearts Reem
Reem cried cried her beloved Syria Reem
cried her beloved country her country
the mother of all country was now
pleading mercy at the feet of a
cold-hearted callous fate Syria is a
mother who had to witness her sons and
daughters aiming weapons at one another
in the name of a country and
slaughtering and beheading in front of
her own eyes and the eyes of the world
in the name of a god and saddest of all
is the story of a muhanad in in arabic
means mother and muhammad is the mother
of Muhammad

a plate of scrambled eggs this happens

for hope ml and I also believe that that
with the conscience of all the red
hearts that Syrian hearts will sing
again for darkness also has an end and
after each night there is
day light and so on that hopeful note I
will close it with the words of my
Syrian friend who wrote her words while
living in Syria dr. Nezhat at the summit
she I hope her voice is a signal amidst
all the noise that we hear on Syria
today and she says from her heart to
yours well in Elam may be dolphin when
LM maybe dolphin are typical baby
Sabrina sir I saw reality Alma hi when I
am overcome with weakness when I am
overcome with weakness i bandaged my
heart with a syrian woman&#39;s patience in
adversity i bandaged it with the upright
posture of a Syrian woman who was not
bent by bereavement poverty or
displacement I bandaged it with the
steadiness of a child&#39;s footsteps in a
refugee camp a child weighing a small
black shoe on one foot and a large blue
sandal on another singing and wandering
off to butterflies and skies seen only
by his tiny eyes i bandaged it i
bandaged it with December&#39;s frozen tree
roots trees that have sworn to blossom
in March or April I bandaged it with the
voice of reason that was not affected by
a proximate desolation i bandaged it
with the conscience of the living with
the conscious of all the red human
hearts and with the image of a homeland
envisioned by the eyes
of the poor thank you
[Applause]
