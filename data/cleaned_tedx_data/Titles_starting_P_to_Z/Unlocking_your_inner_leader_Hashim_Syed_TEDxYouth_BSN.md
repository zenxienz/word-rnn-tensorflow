you
you
it&#39;s a bold world it&#39;s a messy world but
it&#39;s an exciting world now in this
exciting mess that we live in who&#39;s
going to clean it up not our parents not
our teachers know even our prime
ministers we are this generation here
today is going to clean up the world
because we have a responsibility to
bring about positive change and if not
us who else but what is leadership my
journey on this topic of what is
leadership and how we can unlock her
inner leaders started in this very
building just down the corridor it was
September 2014 and I was asked by my
personal statement supervisor are
leaders born or are leaders made and
three years on I stand by my answer that
leaders are made they are made through a
constant process of reflection leading
by example and doing with a smile on
their face because see leadership is not
a gift
it doesn&#39;t come with titles it comes
with gaining the trust and influence of
those around you by building faith by
leading by example going above and
beyond empowering others and believing
in it see the world we live in today is
very similar to Game of Thrones Westeros
is constrained of economic political and
social turmoil
whether it&#39;s backstabbing between
families such as the Lannisters a social
uprising but there&#39;s a new generation on
the rise a generation like us that sees
a new world that can bring about
positive change that Jon Snow&#39;s in the
daenerys targaryen see over the past
seven seasons they&#39;ve been going through
a process to unlock they&#39;re in a leader
and they&#39;re finally in a position now
where they&#39;re bringing about real
credible change and it&#39;s been a hard
journey but rightfully so and they&#39;re
doing it with a smile because we have so
much for excited about several years ago
I was involved with my school hockey
team in London and I loved playing sport
and I love playing hockey and all the
time my academic career where I thought
in grades academic prizes teacher
recognition lots of awards so I assumed
that pea
she just respects me I thought I&#39;m great
but really I had no friends I had no
trust and I had no support for anyone
around me and the problem was I didn&#39;t
realize before it&#39;s too late and a case
in point was in octave we were 12 games
in the season and we hadn&#39;t won a single
match
it was loss after loss after loss our
coach came in he decided to quit players
just come in knowing turn up at training
we were with goal difference a minus 20
we had won a single match players used
to be sent off every single week it was
a complete and utter disaster I hated

turning up in a 9:00 a.m. cold Saturday
morning what a waste of my time but then
it somewhat changed a new coach came in
and he gave me the captaincy now at the
time I felt great I thought finally this
is my chance this gives me authority my
captain&#39;s armband gives me leadership
what I say goes what I have to say
matters it doesn&#39;t matter anyone else
has to say so I pulled everyone together
I said okay we&#39;re gonna do this you&#39;re
gonna play here you&#39;re gonna play there
if we want it if we want to score goals
is how we&#39;re gonna do the route we&#39;re
gonna go in if we have a short corner
we&#39;re going to like this we&#39;re free hit
we&#39;re gonna do that I don&#39;t care what
else had to say I don&#39;t even listen to
the coach I thought use of some new guy
it doesn&#39;t make a difference he doesn&#39;t
know me he doesn&#39;t have a team he&#39;s
giving me the title as I rightfully
deserve that&#39;s it
20 minutes in with three goals down it&#39;s
the same as always and I&#39;m standing
there at the back just looking around
and I think he&#39;s myself god these guys
are all terrible no one can play they
can&#39;t even hit a ball we call ourselves
the first 11 were terrible you know I
thought to myself we need a team of just
pure hashes people like me that look
like me play like me and we finally
actually start winning a few games and
I&#39;m it&#39;s getting to the point where I&#39;m
arguing with the team argue with the
umpire my teammates everyone and this
guy I am marking just talking and
talking and talking in my ear so I just
look at him I&#39;m shoving on the floor
next thing I know the umpire goes in his
pocket and sends me off so as I then sat
there on the bench all alone
it finally occurred to me that I can&#39;t
control my emotions I was an emotional
intelligent see people used to joke with
me and have fun and try be my friends
plays take it the wrong way because I
don&#39;t know how I felt I don&#39;t know what
made me tick
I don&#39;t understand how I can control my
emotions and my feelings I was a
prisoner of my anger and my frustration
so what do I do
I apologize the team I apologized to my
coach I apologized the umpire I started
taking accountability I said to the more
I gave them the captain&#39;s armband back
because I didn&#39;t deserve it now they
kept me captain but I never wore it
again because I hadn&#39;t earned it and I
didn&#39;t deserve it because leadership is
not about I it&#39;s not about you it&#39;s
about others it&#39;s about empowering
others now for me to be most intelligent
I finally start to learn how to be
self-aware now how I felt then manage
these emotions then use this to build
empathy and social relations and
stronger team partnerships and so then
as I used to pull the team together in
every single match after that I used to
say okay what do you think we can do how
can improve what would you like to play
and then we started to win games hearts
go away we went from rock bottom 2nd in
the league and we qualified for the
varsity competition and what I learned
from this that if you&#39;re going to
empower others if you&#39;re going to lead
it starts from within it&#39;s about less
reacting and more respecting so the
challenge I had after that was when I
came to the British Corps the
Netherlands see the British won the
Netherlands is a very special school
with over 2300 students and 80
nationalities it embodies the globalised
interconnected world that we live in
today and being involved with the more
United Nations Society
I assumed that it will be fantastic say
we used to go to conferences we should
go to debates we have resolution
meetings and you would think there were
so many different ways of thinking that
creativity innovation and culture will
ensure that we always came out on top
but it wasn&#39;t the case and coming here
as a new kid it&#39;s always hard because
you don&#39;t want to overdo it you think I
can overdo I can try too much I can say
this and I&#39;ll get nicknamed I&#39;ll get
tagged with certain things but there&#39;s
anything I learned is that I understand
myself and I knew they didn&#39;t have the
time nor did I want to sit around
twiddling my thumb&#39;s because if you want
to make impacts and if you want to bring
people&#39;s case you want to pull people
together and inspire collective action
you have to lead by example if the lead
by doing by taking initiative and
exactly what we did and it didn&#39;t
require any major strategy idea
analytics and metrics no it&#39;s primal
it&#39;s how you make people feel is how you
connect with them so all I did was
poured my son my friends together in the
society and I said look there&#39;s
potential here we are a massive school
we have so many nationalities we go to
so many conferences we can build and
foster a culture with least the leaders
of tomorrow students will come in learn
and develop their strengths and their
weaknesses and they will go on to be
better delegate in a world that is a
mess because more United Nations
embodies that world so any meetings I
went to every meeting every conference
gave him my all but I made sure that
wherever I did and whatever anyone did
or surrounded by other people because if
you can surround yourself with the best
researcher the best analyst the best
marketing person the best negotiator
lobbyists all of different strengths or
weaknesses you start to learn from each
other
and I knew what I was good at but the
trick was that I was as I was hoping
them unlock their inner strengths and
they&#39;re in a leader they were doing the
same for me I was developing my skills I
was availing my strengths I was
developing my weaknesses and I was
becoming a more well-rounded person
and what do we get from this I had the
privilege to be elected as president of
the United Nations IT going into my
final year here
but did a stop there no because I knew
what I&#39;d done before I knew the wrongs I
made before so use this and I said okay
let&#39;s keep us going let&#39;s build the
momentum let&#39;s build a culture shift
here let&#39;s do exactly what we&#39;re doing
for the last year keep it going we
started to win more awards we&#39;ve
attended more conferences we turn in the
world&#39;s largest conference we even had
an idea to host our own event here at
the school and ever since then there&#39;s
been a succession of leaders following
the same ideas following the same goals
and building and fostering newer leaders
and I had no strategy I had no ideas I&#39;d
really really have any marketing all it
was is a mate you make people feel good
by connecting and listening to them he
lead him by doing and leading by example
and now I grew up I came to the
University of York and in my first year
I sought out to be involved in a
non-profit social impact consultancy by
the name of York Community insulting
what we do is we do social impact
projects with charities startups local
businesses but we also connect with
major firms to bring them to our campus
and host employability and skill
sessions workshops with our students
developing their skills and
understanding of the industry around us
and in my first year I was recruited to
be project manager on a project with a
local charity through its marketing and
financial awareness I thought it&#39;s a
great opportunity great chance for me to
continue developing my skills and either
stepped into the role I could tell the
team was in disarray the previous
project managed had been fired the team
wanted to quit the client was unhappy
that Executive Committee wanted to shut
us down but there was opportunity there
was a chance to make an impact again
because if I could connect with others
if I understood myself and I connect
with others and I could lead by
initiative lead by doing then there was
so much potential so I sat down with the
team with the client and I said okay
what&#39;s gone wrong here how can we make
this better we started to understand the
reasons why the project was failing why
the client was unhappy why the team
wanted to quit and from that we started
to develop and we grew we made processes
we thought about it
and by reminding everyone why we entered
this in the first place what was our
original common purpose to bring social
impact and to develop our skills the
project was a massive success in space
of six weeks rather than 10 we turned it
round we won an award for social impact
and I thought great goal achieved
clients happy I&#39;m happy
teams happy it&#39;s all good but then it
changed because you see I realized what
we did was great bringing social impact
providing opportunities for students
there&#39;s nothing like it but we could do
more and if we all we needed was to
connect and integrate more students so I
wanted to launch a consulting conference
an event to bring students here from all
sorts of different universities and
connect them with all the major firms to
give them an insight into what&#39;s
happening teach them the skills so we
can be more social impact more projects
and be even better so apply for the
position of Managing Partner the top
position in this organization and I
thought to myself well they&#39;ve recruited
me for a project that has been a
complete and utter disaster I turn it
around was a great success I&#39;ve got all
these great ideas I&#39;ve shown what I can
do in the past I could be most telogen I
can lead by example so surely they&#39;re
not gonna turn me down but there&#39;s
exactly what they did
they said no I kind of sat there sitting
to myself like thinking why they just
turned me down why have you wasted my
time why did you bring me in for a new
project to save and then deliver and
then you&#39;re saying now no I was an
egotistical I wanted the position
because I thought I could bring impact
because I believed the authority and the
title would give me the command and the
resources necessary to bring about the
idea and change I needed but they just
said no and in the end at the end of the
interview they offered me some measly
lower wrong position and I sat there
thinking well am I gonna shake this
guy&#39;s hand do I really want this not so
much but I took it I said fine okay see
what we can do but then they got worse
and it got worse I used to attend these
meetings committee meetings I used to
hate it I
to see someone else in the position I
really wanted I wanted that job I
deserved that job I wanted to bring
about change and I felt I needed that
title that authority that stamp to make
it happen and I used to look at him
whenever he talked tastes just hate
myself like why is this happening you
step ten minutes speak I just have two
minutes to speak so what&#39;s the point of
me even being here it&#39;s all wasting my
time and for a moment I thought about
quitting
I remember I sat there my room my
university room so I typed up an email
saying I just can&#39;t deal with it I don&#39;t
want this anymore I&#39;m not enjoying I&#39;m
not having fun and I wrote up the email
and I wanted to quit and as I&#39;ve sat
there going to the moments going to the
process I started to think I said why am
I really quitting here because I didn&#39;t
have a title and then I thought back I
said I really want to be that hockey
player there needs it feels they needs a
title just to bring about change because
I showed that I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t need the
captaincy because we finished second do
I need that presidency the Model United
Nations to build a culture shift no you
started before that just by leading by
doing and in this nonprofit as I was
about to quit I realized I don&#39;t need a
title don&#39;t need to be managing partner
it doesn&#39;t make a difference it&#39;s just a
thing you add to your CV to make you
stand out a bit more and I thought what
do I really care about care about this
conference I care about bringing this
idea to life because of the potential it
can bring to our society connecting more
students bringing firms in expanding who
we are and our brand so that&#39;s what I
did I started to believe in the idea I
started take control of it I understood
who I was what I was about and I
connected with others and most of all I
started to smile because life is
exciting it&#39;s a mess but it&#39;s exciting
there&#39;s opportunities that all we have
to do is take advantage of and by
smiling people start to take notice they
started to care because how you feel if
you can be most intelligent and you can
lead by example how you feel with
contagious remember leadership is prime
it&#39;s resonance it&#39;s emotional people
started to care they jumped on the
bandwagon we started to get a team
because originally I also funding they
said they asked for resources they said
no I asked for extra support they said
no but now people wanted to join they
want to be part of this movement this
momentum build we had a team we had
funding with resources was it hard yes
did I care no why because I was loving
it I was enjoying it the first 20
speakers we approached the company event
all said no the next 10 said yes we
applied for scholarships we applied for
funding got rejected we walked into a
pub quiz and came out with a thousand
pounds and was the best day because we
were all so happy about it and this is
the power of a smile because when you
start to take initiative and you start
to believe in your idea other people
want to be part of it and what happened
we had a great event it was the first
time thing that&#39;s ever happened we
connected a hundred students from five
different universities and it was free
we brought up all the major firms and
students were able to secure work
experience from this event developing
their employability and their skills and
what do I get out of it fulfillment it&#39;s
the best thing I&#39;ve ever done I didn&#39;t
need a title I don&#39;t need a stamp of
authority or recognition because I
believed in the idea and it did of a
smile on my face and they made me CEO a
position that didn&#39;t even exist and to
me that was almost a sense of
achievement I felt great but it wasn&#39;t
like before now I was like his a chance
for me to continue doing what I&#39;m
already doing
has my role changed slightly but has
what I do as a person no I still try and
build trust through influence but being
friendly with the purpose bringing
people bringing people together
inspiring collective action I try to
understand them so so anyone who&#39;s here
today I said the style is incumbent on
us to change this world
we don&#39;t need titles we don&#39;t need
recognition leadership is an infinite
game you develop it over time
what you need is to understand yourself
be most intelligent lead by example lead
by doing and deal with a smile on your
face because there&#39;s so much be sighted
about so let&#39;s be bold take initiative
and let&#39;s change the world thank you
[Applause]
