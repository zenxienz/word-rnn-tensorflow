I once had an extraordinary experience
it blew me away it changed my life
and it happened in the strangest way I
was spinning in a centrifuge really fast
my eyeballs were being pushed to the
back of my head I was going 6 G&#39;s that&#39;s
6 times the force of gravity and it felt
like I had a ton of Britt&#39;s bricks on
that were flattening me but I had a
moment of bliss not because of the
discomfort of going so fast but in spite
of it
I had a peak experience a moment that
brings together everything that has
meaning for us our body our mind and
spirit into one place it was incredible
let me tell you how I got there so a few
years ago I was forced to change jobs
and the career counselor at the company
I was working at said to me so what do
you want to do now now I&#39;ve always had
this dream since I&#39;ve been about this
big
but I never really dared to tell anybody
about it certainly not in any kind of
official way but I was thinking since
the career counselor was asking and was
going to give me a training to help me
secure my next job maybe I should go for
it so I looked at the career counselor
straight in the eye and I said the thing
I want to do now is be an astronaut and
the career counselor looked at me and
said come on what do you really want to
do and I said no really this is it this
is what I want to do and I managed to
convince the career counselor to send me
away to the States to a flight training
school and it was there that I got to
wear this flight suit for the very first
time and this flight training school had
a centrifuge and for those of you who
don&#39;t know what a centrifuge is it&#39;s
something you get inside like a
merry-go-round or a carousel and it
spins really fast and goes in three
directions at the same time and it&#39;s
used for pilots and astronauts to help
get them used to the differences in
g-forces and my thoughts were
as I was about to get inside of one of
these this is the moment of truth
I could potentially discover that I&#39;m
not meant to be doing this if I feel the
limitations of my physical body and
perhaps my dream of becoming an
astronaut my lifelong dream could be
coming to a crashing halt
but luckily what happened to me inside
the centrifuge was just the opposite
as I was spinning around and around and
around all I can do is smile from ear to
ear and I felt incredible it was it was
amazing I felt completely like this was
what I was meant to be doing and for me
time stopped it was it was just
incredible and for that moment I knew
that this is what I was meant to be
doing and that I knew my life would
change forever from this point on what I
felt has a name it&#39;s called a peak
experience other astronauts have had
peak experiences when they&#39;ve gone to
space and looked back at the earth and
seeing the Earth from all of its beauty
and had a feeling of oneness with the
universe in fact this very special type
of peak experience is called the
overview effect now dr. Edgar Mitchell
one of the Apollo 13 astronauts had this
very thing happened to him
and probably was one of the first people
who admitted it when he was standing on
the moon from this point looking at the
earth and had what he calls an epiphany
in space where he felt from every cell
in his body that he was connected to
everything and everyone and it was he
was ecstatic when he was experiencing
this he felt that we were all made from
the same thing Stardust and dr. Edgar
Mitchell when he went to space was a
very rational man but when he returned
he came back a changed man and I know
that I felt something similar to Edgar
Mitchell when I was inside the
centrifuge now the overview effect
has gotten a lot of attention recently
because of social media because we can
now see what astronauts see in space we
can with with all these videos out there
but we can&#39;t quite feel what they feel
and that is weightlessness and I would
venture to say that most of us have not
felt this nor have had any kind of peak
experience but we&#39;re fascinated by those
people like astronauts or people who
climb mountains who dare to do these
very risky things in order to have that
possibility of enjoying this peak
experience but it got me thinking can we
potentially achieve the overview effect
here on earth how would we go about
doing something like that and one way we
could actually try to do it is the way
Edgar Mitchell did which is going to
space now there&#39;s a new industry out
there called new space or commercial
space for anybody who has the money and
up substantial amount to go on a
one-hour journey into space and these
flights will probably be starting in
2018 and on that one-hour flight you&#39;ll
be able to as the plane is on its Apogee
experience about four minutes of
weightlessness and before that time
you&#39;ll be having high g-forces on launch
and going back into the Earth&#39;s
atmosphere on reentry also experiencing
high g-forces now that&#39;s what I was
practicing when I was in the centrifuge
going around and around and those
differences in g-forces because it&#39;s not
like anything we&#39;ve experienced here on
earth in fact maybe the closest we can
come is 3GS on a roller coaster on a
really fast one for a few seconds but
these commercial space flights are going
to be six G&#39;s in various forces on your
body in different directions so it&#39;s
quite it&#39;s quite out of this world now
and actually without any kind of
practice or training things get even
more intense
in fact I remember somebody on my space
training
because we were able to see each other
in the centrifuge going around and
around and the person that you would
never have thought would be the one to
experience the fear that he felt was the
biggest strongest most muscular guy and
it wasn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t predict that that
he would have a problem more than I
would have a problem and yet I&#39;ll never
forget his face when he was spinning
around he had to face something like
this which was pretty startling because
nobody expected that and okay this
wasn&#39;t him and he was wearing a shirt
but it was like this and you know he was
turning colors that were not on the
color spectrum and I&#39;m pretty sure he
released some bodily fluids if you know
what I&#39;m saying
so it was crazy in there and you know it
just got me thinking that you know I
know this was a course that I was on to
help people physically prepare for these
differences in g-forces but what about
preventing something like this from
happening somebody who is completely
freaked out were there any courses out
there to help people mentally prepare
for their spiced spaceflight and when I
asked at the training center they said
there were no courses and I knew that I
had to create a course to fill this need
and so I did and I spent the next couple
of years teaching people how to stay
calm and have a peak experience but
let&#39;s just back up for a second imagine
you are one of those six lucky people
who might be going to fly on a space
flight next year now at the moment the
space operators that are flying are not
requiring any kind of training to go
into space hard to believe all you need
to do is pay your money have a good EKG
a good heart and off you go now when I
was thinking about this guy
in the centrifuge I started to think
multiply this by 6 what are the
potential things that could happen while
all 6 people who haven&#39;t been trained
are going to experience well one person
can hyperventilate somebody else could
potentially panic someone might lose
their cookies someone might need a
diaper somebody might be so overly
did they flail around and by accident
kick you in the head there&#39;s six people
and there&#39;s only three windows and so
every time you want to look at the earth
there might be some conflict between
people does this sound like a calm
peaceful life-changing experience to me
it sounds like a recipe for a disaster
and furthermore for every minute that
you&#39;re not fully in the moment you&#39;re
it&#39;s wasting about $8,000 so it pays to
prepare because what&#39;s left of the space
flight is essentially the physical
experience of weightlessness and you
might get some views in space but
chances are you&#39;ll be walking off the
space flight scratching your head
thinking you know I missed it by the
time I got calm and started to
understand what was happening all around
me the flight was over now that would be
a shame but that&#39;s just the physical
feeling of going on one of these space
flights what if you want to experience
the one and only overview effect that
feeling of oneness with the universe how
would you go and prepare for that well I
said earlier that the overview effect is
a type of peak experience so we can use
the research from peak experience to
also help us try to achieve the overview
effect now peak experience has achieving
one of these things the research says
there&#39;s two conditions that need to be
met the first is having full awareness
and the second is being in flow and I
will explain both of those things but
even if you have full awareness and in
flow there is no guarantee that you are
going to have a peak experience because
you also need a bit of luck or some
people would say an act of grace but one
thing is for sure if you&#39;re not in full
awareness or in flow ain&#39;t nothing could
happen to you so it&#39;s good to go and try
to prepare for both of these conditions
so let&#39;s talk about full awareness well
full awareness is understanding what&#39;s
going on outside of you externally
what&#39;s going on inside the space plane
and also what&#39;s going on inside of you
and pilots call what&#39;s going on outside
situational awareness so understanding
what the situation is who&#39;s there
what&#39;s going on what&#39;s coming up next
the personal awareness is the awareness
of what&#39;s going on inside of you and
only you can say that and feel that so
I&#39;ve created a word that I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s
got to catch on and it&#39;s called Bob oosa
and Bob oosa stands for something and i
use it to help commercial astronauts try
to become fully aware both externally
and internally so I&#39;m wondering who
wants to do some space training in here
raise your hands
yeah all right excellent let&#39;s do it
together
so Bob oosa has each of the literate
letters in volusia stands for something
so if we do this together the first one
probably one of the most important steps
is to breathe it was or is to and the
breath is the link between the body and
the mind and it&#39;s the bridge that will
keep us calm when we&#39;re feeling stressed
so I&#39;d like everybody to take a deep
breath in and then hold it and blow it
out good you&#39;re pros already all righty
now observe very important step look
around you observe your surroundings
check out the person sitting next to you
maybe that&#39;s the crazy person that&#39;s
gonna kick you in the head you never
know but it&#39;s good to be prepared so
check it out look who&#39;s around you
and see what&#39;s happening and if that
thought might be a little bit unsettling
then let&#39;s go and again Brigades another
deep breath in hold it and then breathe
it out okay good feeling a little bit
better now U stands for understanding
what&#39;s coming up in the flight profile
are you at launch are you at
weightlessness or are you going to be
coming into preparing for re-entry
because each of these different flight
phases will have different breathing
techniques that you might need to master
before you can actually go into that
safely okay since this is now going back
inside and doing a scan of what&#39;s going
on internally what are you seeing what
are you feeling what are you hearing and
only you know
how you doing now so go back inside take
a scan relax okay and now that you have
this calm feeling you want to anchor it
and you anchor it by introducing a
trigger and a trigger is I use my thumb
squeezing my thumb as my trigger so
every time I go through by boosah my
body and my mind start to get the
connection of calmness and then
squeezing the thumb calmness squeezing
the thumb going through the sequence and
soon this connection becomes stronger
and stronger and stronger that I don&#39;t
need to go through the sequence anymore
all I can do all I can use is squeezing
my thumb and the body relaxes instantly
now you can actually even intensify this
if you want to use neurofeedback tools
which is what I do in my space training
so you can make that connection quicker
and quicker and quicker and then you can
use this anytime and anywhere in fact
it&#39;s not just for space because before I
came on stage I also used it and it
works so it&#39;s it&#39;s the tool that gives
us the full awareness as well as helped
calm us down when we need it okay
anybody have a peak experience now I
wouldn&#39;t think so because remember we
said the peak experience has two
components full awareness and being in
flow so I&#39;d like to talk now about what
it is to be in flow now being in flow is
enjoying an activity so much being so
engaged that you&#39;re completely in the
moment and you lose track of time and
athletes and musicians tend to have this
all the time some people say that
they&#39;re in the zone and that&#39;s when they
do really good high performing that&#39;s
when they perform their best so I&#39;m
curious if anybody has had this
wonderful feeling of being in the flow
maybe by doing a project in school that
you&#39;ve been so engrossed with that
you&#39;ve just completely lost track of
time anyone see a couple hands good this
is a good sign that you two can have a
peak experience so if you have full
awareness and you&#39;re in flow and a
little bit of luck you too can achieve a
peak experience because space is not
just for the elite and the overview
effect is not just for astronaut
you can achieve the overview effect here
on earth yes here on earth and so the
next time that you might have a
difficult project like a test or a
presentation they has a little bit and
gives you a little bit of fear you can
take these tools that we&#39;ve done today
and turn that fear into joy and if you
do that and I do that and this idea
spreads we&#39;ll be on our way to achieving
our Boulder bigger world thank you
[Applause]
