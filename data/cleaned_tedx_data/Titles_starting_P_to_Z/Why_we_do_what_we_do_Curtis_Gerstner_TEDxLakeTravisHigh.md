hi oh I didn&#39;t see you there
when I was younger when I was younger I
always what what do you want
no get out I&#39;m doing you think I can&#39;t
do that right now you only doing your
tickers and I didn&#39;t see you there
I was just enjoying a drink you see was
younger always in his questions okay
real-time but the one where I drank
bleach that was nice that was nice
you see when I was younger I always
asked questions I was fascinated by
everything around me because it was all
new and exciting and I wanted to learn
as much as I possibly could
one of my favorite things to do was play
the Y game for those of you who don&#39;t
know what this is I&#39;ll demonstrate it I
would ask my dad things like dad why is
the sky blue and then he would say
because the light in the sky is blue
well well why
but because the air makes the light
change color why because that&#39;s how
works well why we talked about this when
you have questions like this go ask your
mother I like all the parents in the
audience they&#39;re going yeah that&#39;s their
lives but when I started growing up I
stopped asking as many questions and I
definitely stop playing the why game I
still wanted to learn but most things
started to feel normal and uninteresting
but this is the opposite of what is true
even the most basic thing we use on a
daily basis can be extraordinarily
complex like this a pencil it&#39;s just a
pencil but the amount of work that goes
into producing just one of these is
insane multiple companies hundreds of
pounds of wood graphite rubber thousands
of workers and millions of consumers go
into being able to buy just this one
pencil so my argument is is that we
don&#39;t ask quite enough questions I think
that as we get older we should always be
learning new things and becoming experts
and the things we care about and a good
way to do this is by playing the WYD
game and I wanted to test myself on the
thing I should know the most about and
see what happens when playing the Y game
subject I chose the test was human
nature because that and also because I&#39;m
a human so I should under them
understand them pretty well right so I
call this why we do what we do
so I&#39;ll start simple why do we eat well
we eat because we get hungry why do we
get hungry because it&#39;s our body telling
us we need food why do we need food so
we don&#39;t die
why do we not want to die well alright
so I found the line okay that&#39;s the line
I will not cross so that will go on the
list why do we do what we do so we don&#39;t
die but there&#39;s a flaw in this logic we
eat because we get hungry and I don&#39;t
think I don&#39;t know about you guys but
there have been many times where I
didn&#39;t really need technically to eat
that third piece of cake
but I still did and
means I had some alternative motive and
the motive was that the cake was just so
dang good so it becomes why do we eat
because it tastes good well why do we
want things to taste good because it&#39;s a
good feeling
why do we want to feel good to make life
more enjoyable why do we want life to be
more enjoyable so we don&#39;t want to die
so this this means having the will to
survive but that will dur survive is
only there because we enjoy life so
we&#39;ll just put that down as to make life
more enjoyable how about why do we wear
clothes
well we wear clothes to keep warm for
two reasons so we don&#39;t die and so we
don&#39;t feel done pleasantry of cold but
it splits why do we wear clothes to look
good you know keep it sharp and then why
why do we want to look good because it
makes us feel good about ourselves and
then it and then it splits again why do
you want to look good so others find us
more appealing and then why do we want
others to find this more appealing so
it&#39;s easier to attract a mate why to
mate
why to make babies but but why do we
want children this is another full stop
because there&#39;s no rational reason to
have a child I know so think about it
imagine if I try to sell you a thing
that costed tens of thousands of dollars
and all it did was eat all your food
take up 70% of your free time got in
trouble made you lose sleep and it made
you put in hundreds of painstaking hours
just raising it and trying to make it a
half decent human being and right right
is all that money and time was about to
pay off it made you give even more money
and it left you for college only coming
back to visit on holidays and special
occasions and if you ask me that sounds
like the worst infomercial I&#39;ve ever
heard and that&#39;s pretty impressive
because I watch a lot of late-night TV
but despite all of that there&#39;s still
somehow seven billion of those things on
our planet
anyway so far our list is made up of so
we don&#39;t die to like make life more
enjoyable and to make babies and a
little spoiler here but this is the full
list I&#39;m unable to find anything else
that is not fueled by any of these three
basic driving factors and for those of
you who think that this can never be the
case I&#39;d like to show you this mat this
is called Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs
the needs is basically a set of five
human needs the needs at the bottom are
more important and in order to work your
way up through the levels in your way to
work your way up through the pecking
order
the first need is physiological needs
these are things humans need to survive
such as food water air Wi-Fi etc the
safety needs are having an abundance of
those physiological needs love and
belonging is the need to have
relationships and such as loved ones
friends family self esteem is respect
among others as well as self-confidence
and the final level is
self-actualization this work this means
you have become the best person you can
be and feel completely fulfilled and
when I found these I realize that they
parallel my three answers of why we do
what we do the first two levels are
things humans need to survive or so we
don&#39;t die the love and belonging is is
the need to feel loved and the best way
to feel this is by starting a family or
to make babies and this top two are
makes you feel good about yourself or to
make life more enjoyable so what does
what does this all mean heck if I know
all I know is I need to include research
in my TED talk and this was the first
thing that appeared on Google Images but
that does not mean I think it&#39;s a broken
system I still think that we can explain
anything we do using one or more of
these three basic explanations and if
you don&#39;t believe me I&#39;ll prove it
why do we have friends so we can build
really relationships and share
experiences or to feel good also so we
can have people we depend on in case we
need help or get in trouble like if we
get mauled by a tiger so for survival
why do we grow so so we put stronger and
stronger and smarter to become I mean to
live on our own as well as to physically
be able to make babies
yay puberty why did we grow up us so we
can lose imagination set more realistic
goals I know it&#39;s sad but it&#39;s true so
we don&#39;t die and also so we feel good
when we achieve those goals how about
why do we give TED talks so we can share
our ideas and well why do we want to
share our ideas so we can make the world
a better place for ours and others
enjoyment you&#39;re welcome but then it
splits why do we give TED talks so we
can perform in front of people well why
do you want to perform in front of
people to show people how intelligent or
witty you are you know and then why do
you want people to know you&#39;re
intelligent or witty so others find you
more appealing why so it&#39;s easier to
attract a mate why it&#39;s mate why to make
babies
call me it&#39;s toll-free now it&#39;s one
thing for me to stand up here you know
sprouting out from a script and with
pre-made slides but I&#39;m gonna do a
little bit of improvisation so I want
you all to think of a question relating
to why we do what we do the question
could be anything like why do we wear
socks or why do we listen to music or
what&#39;s the meaning of life just easy
stuff like that so does anyone have one
they would like me to try because we
long time so just shout him out why do
we brush our teeth so our breath doesn&#39;t
smell crappy why it&#39;s to get friends why
feel good or you know if you&#39;re like
making out with someone they&#39;re not you
know no so the babies one as well and I
mean I guess you could die if you don&#39;t
have teeth and they fall out so anyone
else I&#39;d have fun to find new friends so
to make life more enjoyable also if
those friends are of the opposite gender
or same gender that one and the others
sorry what was that
why do we listen to people so we can
learn so we can oh geez if so we can
learn so we can become more presentable
and no more stuff to attract people but
also to feel good just because you know
like I&#39;m smarter than you
so that and we&#39;re low on time so this
has all been fun and games but it&#39;s time
to get serious
Tech can I get some mood lighting
perfect all right so why does this
matter what&#39;s the point of knowing why
we put jam on toast why don&#39;t we just
put the jam on the toast and to be
honest I don&#39;t think there is a point to
knowing why we do what we do so why
should you care well the reason I shared
this all with you was to make you ask
questions where that question is how is
a pencil made or why do I play the piano
or should I give the TED presenters a
Starbucks gift card the topic tonight is
being human and being a human to me at
least means try new things changing and
adapting
the only way to adapt is to learn I&#39;m
the only way to learn is by asking
questions don&#39;t end this talk with my
favorite quote as the great Greek
philosopher once said why thank you
