I just came from malala&#39;s which is
around 45 kilometers away and Oh
during my drive here I used to remember
that I actually went back and forth
every day to UPD Lima to our house in
Madonna&#39;s I used to go come out around 8
o clock in the morning my classes around
10 o clock I will catch that the bus I
will wait for a particular bus that will
actually have a drop near Quezon Avenue
and at Catherine Avenue I would have to
take the jeepney and then right down to
the Palma Hall I will actually select
which particular stairwell that I would
have to take so that I don&#39;t get to be
late in my class
I usually get to be late because that
drive is around 2 hours and there were
no fxe then because all buses is well
all GPS I think the story is all
familiar with you because some of you
are really from the provinces and when
you come here as medical students as
ordinary students or workers you would
actually have to ride one of those
vehicles and they actually said 40
kilometers one way another 40 kilometres
the other way that&#39;s actually around 4
hours of my 24-hour life
eventually I realized that I was wasting
around 1/10 of my year let&#39;s take around
one month and a half
oh my ear sitting in an FX trying to
make the best out of it and trying to
read trying to do our homeworks trying
to program inside an FX in a very
cramped place depending on whether you
sit you can sit in the middle you can
sit in the back and the problem really
is not doing things for the productively
inside the vehicle but trying to find
out why do I really want to go from
Malolos to UPD Limon and back and forth
for my at that time I was just really
thinking well it&#39;s my own place it&#39;s my
own bed my cat is
my parents are there the food is free
but eventually I have to give all that
up because I was losing one month of my
life but transportation is not just
about commuting transportation is about
bringing not only people from one place
to another it&#39;s also bringing goods
bringing animals bringing things that
you would need at some point during your
production life productive life it&#39;s
about moving you months moving animals
and moving goods so transportation is
not just about the traffic that you
reach you would see every day
transportation is about having the
things that you would use to be there
when you would need it the problem is
it&#39;s not always working as you would see
with traffic sometimes the goods that
you would have to use are not there the
patience that you would have to cure
would have to travel from where they
start and to your hospital the people
who would actually try to see
entertainment trying to eat there at
restaurants would have to get out of
their homes and go to those places that
they would want to do that and most
especially our workers they would have
to go out of their houses to go to the
word that they would do so that they
would have a productive life during the
weekend the weekday and on weekends they
would try to find some recreation you
must really want to travel around they
don&#39;t want to stay at one place they
want to walk they want to go from one
place to another and the best way really
is to do what I&#39;m doing right now you
want to walk you want to go around
walking from our house even inside our
house we don&#39;t really stay at one room
of course we always want to see we&#39;ve
also we always want to be like the birds
and one early in the century heavier
than air travel has been invented by the
Wright brothers
several years before that there was
balloon flight and flying now has been
so common that also already have peace
affairs right rails just around outside
your your whole is a very I think that&#39;s
the newest rail transport system in the
metro several decades already and the
MRT the PNR and what used to be the
Manila Dagupan railroad were once the
lifeblood of Luzon connecting the north
and the south right now of course if you
just look at the map of the Philippines
we are one big archipelago we have
several hundred thousands of islands and
when you want to go from one island to
another
before the Peace of Paris of the fly of
the early airlines you actually have to
go Superferry
you have to go your row row you have to
take your small watercraft to go from
one island to another but most familiar
to everybody is actually your road
system we travel with human powered
bikes we traveled with cars we travel
using taxis most of us have taken the
cheap knee and this is where traffic is
most familiar to everybody but all of
these vehicles all of these ways to
travel are actually part not just only
of transportation but part of linking
with each other of course in the future
we want to do something else with what
we were using right now internal
combustion engines there are new
discoveries and electric vehicles my
team in the National Institute of
Physics is actually developing
intelligent sensing for cars
we&#39;ll try we&#39;re trying to do put lidar
in cars so that we can sense if there&#39;s
enough
option there and therefore avoids
accidents happening the other one of
course is space the Philippines now has
its own satellite there are scientists
already from the Philippines doing
research in Japan trying to figure out
the start of our space industry then you
know you have Elon Musk trying to have
their Hyperloop alternatives Hyperloop
is essentially a pneumatic tube is a big
empty corridor without any air and
therefore your vehicles can actually
travel from one point to another without
much friction because there&#39;s no air but
the problem really is that in planning
transportation most of our
transportation planners will just look
at what is there and usually what is
there is traffic and the main point that
they want to do is to reduce that
congestion in fact the solution of most
of our transfer planners is not to
decongest the city the solution is
actually to build more roads in fact I
think they watched kevin costner and
they took this heart in the field of
dreams if you will build it they will
come and in fact the problem is this
when you build roads when you widen
roads you don&#39;t really get to reduce
congestion the best example there would
be trying to get out of tight belt by
loosening it you don&#39;t really solve the
problem by loosening your belt the way
through out of it is to reduce your
weight to reduce your obessed but of
course this is exactly what economists
call induced demand if you have one of
that product and you do more or you make
more then people would actually use it
more now that&#39;s the same with roads
roads if you build more of it the
drivers will actually come samos
Schwartz in his book street smart
actually wrote this down and he has been
a transportation planner for in New York
for several years now Turner in Durant
and actually found out that if you build
10% of roads more roads in a city then
10% for that same period of the
vehicular capacity will actually be used
up as well and therefore driving would
also increase by 10% this one-to-one
correspondence is exactly what we are
saying in this slide that if you build
more roads more drivers will come and
congestion will not be so in fact even
if you build public transport so public
transport you would actually think that
if you build one more LRT one more MRT
or one more subway in Metro Manila you
would actually reduce the number of
people on the road but if you&#39;re these
those people you will actually just
replace those people who are using
transit by new drivers because their
roads are still there the roads will
still be used by new drivers the reason
for this is really all about people
wanting to travel if you expand people&#39;s
ability to travel then they will do it
more if you remember my story earlier I
lived around 40 kilometers away from
Manila and once the FX were there it was
so easy for me compared to taking a bus
to go back and forth to Manila and back
to Milano&#39;s but the problem really is
now when the congestion has started and
that&#39;s when I started thinking about my
lost 12% in fact I took this just before
a game I think this is familiar for
people coming from guessing Avenue they
are actually building a new highway
across Metro Manila linking the North
and the South Luzon Expressway there are
exits here around seven or
exit lanes around along this route I&#39;m
not sure if you erm will be part of it
but it&#39;s not just all about building
more roads it&#39;s all about questioning do
we really need this rose
across Metro Manila the other problem
really is widening roads if you come if
you were from Fairview and you lived
there for since your childhood
several decades ago the Commonwealth
Avenue is absolutely just two or three
lanes now it&#39;s eight lanes enough for an
airliner to actually land on it but is
that going to solve the problem of
safety is that going to actually reduce
congestion from the previous points that
I said mentioned increasing Road widths
would not actually solve congestion
you&#39;re just allowing more drivers to use
this lanes but on the question of road
safety increasing Lane widths or adding
more lanes will actually have a downward
effect especially with accidents and it
turned out that even if you narrow down
the width of your roads you actually get
to reduce accidents by a significant by
a measurable degree or at least maintain
the same accident rate as those with
wider roads now what is the effect of
reducing Road width if you reduce Road
width then you actually get to build
other uses of those areas that you have
taken away for example you can build
biking links you can build parking you
can actually build better pedestrian
lanes for people who would want to walk
who would want to bike or who would want
to use this space in our cities now it
turns out also that even if you reduce
the width of your roads you don&#39;t
actually get to reduce the capacity it&#39;s
counterintuitive to some that narrower
streets
absolutely build the same capacity as
wider streets but it turns out with
studies in the US and in the UK that if
you reduce your width of your road
the capacity will still be at least the
same now the whole idea of this is
really about trying to find out what is
more useful for people it&#39;s not about
really just looking at one metric one
metric would be reducing kappa reducing
congestion but the other metric would
also be travel time the other metric
would be probably what is useful for
everybody
happiness for in in traveling from one
point to another
the main point that I think transport
engineers or planners would avoid is
that the fact that human behavior would
be impacted by its environment change
and if you change the environment like
add roads wide wider roads sighs then
people will adjust people will actually
add and change their behavior according
to what is presented to them it&#39;s all
about density and connectivity my
students actually do research in
networks and one of the things that
we&#39;re trying to study is what is the
most efficient way to go from one point
to another in a network just like a road
system and it turns out that if you have
more connections as density of
connections or increased connectivity
more degrees of connections from one
point to another then your network will
be more robust instead of having one
line for example in LRT to one point of
error one breakdown in the line will
effectively shut down the line but we
have that if you have alternative ways
to go around or to adapt then people
will actually adapt to that change in
your network now that is where we go to
multi modal and multi nodal points and
that means that each
terminal will bring you to other
terminals when I was going to Manila for
the first time my mother told me you
only have to remember how to go to two
places talk about endo careful because
in Cuba or in Kappa you can get energy
all around Manila and that&#39;s a multi
node and Multi multi node system
multimodal system would be in Kappa we
want to find jeeps you want to find that
C&#39;s we want to find eller T&#39;s and all
the rest that&#39;s what we live of course
intelligent systems you want to have
intelligent systems in the sense that
your network will actually add that way
before things will happen and
accessibility of course is another point
where you want your multi modes your
multi nodes to be accessible by
everybody these are other things that
you could think about in changing the
public transport system in the
Philippines and in the world we want to
have dynamic forecasting my students are
working on this if I go out for example
there in in Aurora I would want to
actually project will there be traffic
in U P and the rest electronic journey
pyres this is being used in London last
mile solutions do you know what this is
called in the Philippines
it&#39;s called tricycles and GPS it breaks
it their home and we want to have of
course a public cycling system active
traffic management by our managers and
of course pedestrian planning here the
problem is pedestrians or second-class
citizens when you try to cross Aurora
you&#39;ll most probably get run by a jeep
or a car rather than people stopping and
letting you cross the street do we
really need smart taxis and of course we
also want vehicles like this to be
enabled with technologies so that we can
interconnect each other so that we would
want to have
efficient transport of people goods and
services the transportation is not
really just about moving things it&#39;s not
about proving you or mean is about
moving our lives thank you very much and
good afternoon
