what makes you uncomfortable it&#39;s being
on a stage being naked
let me tell you about a story in which I
was a nude art model on a stage in front
of 40 people under fluorescent lighting
on a Saturday morning being a nude art
model was one of my uncomfortable
experiences and today I&#39;m going to share
my ongoing two-step process to be
comfortable being uncomfortable and why
this process has a simple mechanism to
jumpstart your confidence who cannot use
a little boost of confidence
now I figured being a nude art model
would be a great uncomfortable
experience considering I had a birthmark
on my back it looked like a goat kicked
me and I had skin it was so blotchy and
transparent that you could confuse
congested traffic on a Google map on my
thigh I&#39;m the type of person who wears
the paper smock thing in the doctor&#39;s
room because I don&#39;t want one person
looking at me naked let alone dozens
with paintbrushes or pens so I called
around I did some research turns out
there&#39;s an art class that practices
every Saturday morning they&#39;ve been
practicing since 2006 with painting nude
art models I thought okay this sounds
pretty legit I show up the next class
and the instructor had told me okay you
could sit in the back you could observe
just watch maybe if the Booker for the
models is there the professional models
you could talk about being this we could
talk about being a substitute at some
point in that classroom I could only
take the back seat because it was packed
there were forty some easels with people
tying their smocks squirting their pain
angling their easels to get the best
view of the stage I thought wow this is
not a casual Saturday morning art class
this is like going to paintball practice
or something and as I sat in that back
row the first model waltzed onto the
stage and she struck some Xena the
warrior princess
host with a bow and arrow I don&#39;t even
know where she got her prop but she was
regal rigid clearly she had done this
before and just after 5 10 maybe 15
minutes I lost track it was time for a
break
that was the warm-up post I thought oh I
can go to the other side of the room
I can go and see what they those artists
painted from their point of view this is
great but Mike ran up to me the
organizer whom I spoke with and said
guess what Beck
one of the models has a flat tire so
we&#39;re gonna have to use you are you
ready now how are you not ready to be
naked
assuming you bathe every day this is not
a I forgot my notes situation so I said
oh great I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll be right back
and I ran into the bathroom and the
bathroom I had one of those
laughing hysteria fits the kind that
makes you look deranged right before you
break down into tears summer you know
and I&#39;m exactly talking about because
that&#39;s the only thing I could think to
do how absurd of this situation I was
now in but there I was those are the
whole point of doing these experiences
so I had to go on that stage I had to do
it and back out stay back outside
Mike introduced me as a substitute model
and I was approaching the stage all the
little steps like I was going to the
guillotine thinking do I know anybody in
here
what is the photography policy in here
what if someone paints a portrait girl
with the goat kicked back and sells it
in the cafe down the street did I shave
these are a few of the thoughts I&#39;m
thinking of but again at that time I was
already on stage I had to do this so I
shut my eyes maybe that would help and I
struck this first pose this kind of like
well I just will just go up back up here
and nothing happened no one said what&#39;s
that mark
no one said look at that blotchy skin
nothing
I just heard the faint ting ting ting
people painting with their paintbrushes
washing the brushes and their little
paint jars and as the minutes went by I
thought I&#39;m okay I&#39;m getting me maybe
I&#39;m getting good at this okay a little
bit more comfortable with this even
though there were two double Niagara
Falls of gushing from my armpits and my
leg is twitching but I was okay so for
the next pose I said I&#39;m gonna do
something I&#39;m gonna do something a
little bit more challenging for the
artist I will do this crouching pose
here&#39;s another rendition of it and then
I realized that without doubt three four
maybe ten people could now see directly
up my behind but I was okay
no one said anything
people just ting ting ting ting just
painting along and it was fine and as
soon as that pose was called called I
ran off the stage and I said Mike I am
so sorry I&#39;m sure that pose made a
couple people a little uncomfortable and
he said uh back back we have seen
hundreds of bodies over the years and
frankly hundreds of parts no one is
uncomfortable now including you every
year I pick a saying to live by it&#39;s
kind of like a New Year&#39;s resolution but
easier because you just followed the
saying although that&#39;s the hard part
people start sending the knees to me in
november/december every year and my mom
in 2014 sent me this one be comfortable
being uncomfortable I said mom why&#39;d you
send me this one she said honey you&#39;re
not comfortable being uncomfortable she
was right because I try to avoid
uncomfortable situations
anything that&#39;s awkward I go out of my
way to make sure people are super
comfortable she reminded me that even on
the playground when I was little and
something uncomfortable happened someone
burst into tears I would run the other
way
so 2015 that was gonna be my year to be
comfortable being uncomfortable I was
gonna get good being out here outside
the comfort zone next to uncomfortable
stuff that life has being human most of
us like to be in here inside the comfort
zone protected and shielded from all the
uncomfortable stuff of the world it was
going to be a tough year but I developed
a two-step process to get good at being
comfortable with the uncomfortable step
one is the Jomo FOMO test that&#39;s a joy
of missing out or fear of missing out if
you were to come to me two years ago and
say hey Beck do you want to scale off a
forty seven storey skyscraper
I&#39;d say no no I do not I&#39;m pretty sure I
have to refold my laundry that day that
is Jomo I would take a lot of joy in
missing out on that experience some of
you in here would go yes I&#39;m so excited
when is that and that is FOMO you would
hate to miss out on that experience that
is not an uncomfortable experience for
you everyone&#39;s comfort zone is deeply
personal what&#39;s uncomfortable to me may
not be uncomfortable to you may not be
uncomfortable to person sitting next to
you this is why you must do step one of
this process which is the Jomo FOMO test
now step two practice practice is hard
it is deliberate it is doing something
over and over again so you get good at
that something here a few things that I
did to get comfortable being
uncomfortable I was homeless for a night
in downtown San Diego I wore burqa for a
day
I built a shelter of sticks and lived in
the sticks literally I went to a
pro-life pro-choice protest complete
with megaphones I&#39;ve performed and wrote
a poem oops not yet I attended a four
day meditation retreat I went to meThe
support groups I was in a wheelchair for
a day I wrote and performed a poem in
front of about 400 people I was a drag
queen
stand-up comedian a day laborer a
Scientologist and a panhandler I could
go on but I said that this process has a
simple mechanism to boost to jumpstart
your confidence this simple mechanism is
so good so addictive
that I&#39;ve actually made be comfortable
with the uncomfortable a theme for last
year and this year the simple mechanism
is the confidence flywheel it is an
endless source of confidence let me
explain this a flywheel is a revolving
piece of machinery it&#39;s a wheel that&#39;s
inside a machine that keeps stability
that C it keeps power going in the
machine when you start anything you are
not good at it
it is exceedingly uncomfortable because
it&#39;s so novel and a lot of times what&#39;s
uncomfortable keeps us from doing it to
begin with but as you practice as you
get a little bit more in the groove of
it you get good at it
marginally even and as you practice more
you get on you get comfortable with that
and as you get comfortable and you
practice it more then you gain the
confidence to think okay I could do the
next level I could do the next stage of
this thing now here&#39;s the neat part
about the confidence flywheel and the
process of doing and being comfortable
with the uncomfortable you jumpstart the
confidence flywheel you don&#39;t start at
the top where you have to start from
square one and basically get good and
then practice and then get comfortable
and then practice and then get confident
you already are comfortable with
something uncomfortable and everything
we start or do is uncomfortable to begin
with let me give you one more story to
illustrate this point I have not liked
Heights edges this is off of a tie at
all skyscraper which I&#39;ll explain in a
minute ever since I was a little girl
and I was on the very edge of this very
tall slide which by the way has been
shut down because you could totally
crack your head open
I have not likes edges
turns out lucky me there was an event
called
over the edge it has you rappel off of
this skyscraper of course I had to sign
up for this lovely experience and when
you first get there you have to go
through 20 people who show you how to
work the GoPro and your walkie-talkie
and how basically not to die and all
this good stuff and then you get to the
actual edge were there about 10 people
waiting for you the first thing you do
is you put on these little blue booties
it&#39;s so that you do not scuff the side
of the skyscraper literally I&#39;m like is
this harder to clean than pee I guess so
because you have to put the booties on
they&#39;re like put on the booties
something like okay and as I&#39;m putting
these shoes booties on I&#39;m thinking
someone anybody could just
snip-snip me away from these skinny
little ropes my booties flying up like
little poof marks like the coyote when
he&#39;s going over a cliff to chase the
roadrunner that was gonna be me but at
this point I was already perpendicular
to the wall and one of the organizers
said look down look down and I look down
and I see that there was ants that
there&#39;s cars that look like the size of
ants and that&#39;s when your brain says
something is wrong with this situation
this is not a good situation but I was
there and when the organisers then said
let go let go of course I had been
holding on to that skinny little rope
for my life and after about 20 seconds I
did let go and I made it all the way
down then atrociously tall building now
after doing this experience I feel of
course comfortable with edges but
because I&#39;ve done this process of being
comfortable with the uncomfortable I&#39;m
really comfortable with something
uncomfortable so much so that I started
taking helicopter lessons something I
thought was all we would always be so
great if it wasn&#39;t for how uncomfortable
it was it&#39;s very technical you could
totally kill yourself I have never flown
a plane in my life for example
even my pilot my first instructor said
don&#39;t you don&#39;t you want to learn how to
fly first that&#39;s usually what people do
to get calm
and I said I&#39;m already I&#39;m already
comfortable with what&#39;s uncomfortable
this is a photo I took from one of my
last flights a few weeks ago now I have
FOMO if I miss one of the flights
sometimes they even fly with one of the
doors off you do not need to do
helicopter lessons or rappelling off a
skyscraper to get the confidence
flywheel rolling and to even jumpstart
it by doing this two-step process you
can start with anything that today
passes your jomo FOMO test for some of
you that may be introducing yourself to
someone you would never approach because
you have jomo about rejection for others
it may be confronting someone because
you have jomo about confrontation here&#39;s
the deal though if you want to get rid
of jomo you want to get really good with
being comfortable with the uncomfortable
you&#39;re going to need step two and that&#39;s
practice thank you so much
