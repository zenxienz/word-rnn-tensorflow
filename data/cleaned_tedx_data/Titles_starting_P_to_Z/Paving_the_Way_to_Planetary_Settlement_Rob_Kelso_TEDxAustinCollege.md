for centuries humankind has dreamed of
living among the stars and this really
took off to the 1950s and 60s with
science fiction books and movies of
outposts on the moon and adventures on
colonies on Mars and who was not
captivated a year ago with the movie the
Martian by best-selling author Andy weir
of an astronaut who gets left for dead
in a sandstorm only to revive and that
having to survive in the harsh
environment of the red planet Mars
closer to home though and reality is
Elon Musk&#39;s of SpaceX whose real dream
is to settle Mars with the spaceship
going there from him as early as 2024
and in 50 years having factories and
pizza joints so the premise here is that
planetary settlement is not a question
of if but rather a question of when and
the and the reasons why are getting very
interesting in the discussion is much
more than the traditional values of
science and exploration and discovery
over the last few years that discuss
discussions have centered around human
sustainability and human survivability
becoming a multi-planet species to
become risk-averse of some catalysts
cataclysmic event that might wipe wipe
out the whole human race and the
dinosaurs certainly knew about
extinction didn&#39;t they 66 million years
ago a large comet or astronaut asteroid
impacted into the southern part of the
Gulf of Mexico and the Yucatan Peninsula
and it produced a huge tsunami that
wiped out the plant and animal life all
across North America but worse it
a huge upwelling of debris and material
that shrouded our planet and prevented
the solar energy from the Sun from
reaching the surface resulting in a
cooling-off period and the extinction of
the dinosaurs
some have comically said that the
extinction of the dinosaurs was because
they didn&#39;t have a space program but
we&#39;ve got a space program and the debate
is whether to go to the Moon or Mars
some say we need to just bypass the moon
do not pass go do not collect $200 go
straight to Mars with maybe a couple
hundred people to become multi-planet
species others say now forget Mars let&#39;s
just go the direct to the moon I and
other scientists and engineers think we
ought to go to Mars but by way of the
moon using the moon to test the
technologies and the concepts and
develop the ideas for how we can live
off the planet because the moon is only
three days away where Mars there&#39;s a
year and a half away and who does not
remember the first footstep on the moon
with Neil Armstrong on Apollo 11 but who
remembers the last footstep December
1972 Apollo 17 was the last manned lunar
mission to the moon it ended the 10
years of the Apollo program it sat on
the moon for ten days and over over
three days
they conducted three long spacewalks
even riding around an electric car they
found orange soil on their exploration
which was orange glass from volcanic
eruptions millions of years ago it even
included the first scientist on the moon
a geologist dr. Harrison Jack Schmitt
but when they left many of us thought
just a few years we&#39;ll be back to
exploring the moon with humans again or
maybe we&#39;ll use the Apollo program as
the stepping stone to now move on to
Mars but it was not to be it has been 45
years
since we&#39;ve had a footstep on the moon
it is time to go back to the moon the
moon is very different today than it was
during the Apollo program in the time
period of Apollo we thought it was not
only airless but waterless that any
water that might exist would just
sublimate away how wrong we were how
very wrong we were since 2008
we have known that there&#39;s water on the
moon lots of water one estimate
indicates that there could be 10 billion
metric tons of water that&#39;s billion with
the be enough water that would fill the
Great Salt Lake in Utah and the water is
a game-changer for us it exempts new
capabilities for resources say on the
International Space Station in orbits
the earth in low-earth orbit every 90
minutes but is totally dependent on the
earth for supplies this is totally
reliant on the earth for food for water
for air for for clothing for propellant
and as we go on to expand humanity among
the stars we can&#39;t operate that way
we&#39;re we&#39;re dependent on the earth we
have to become not earth reliant but
earth and dependent and be able to live
in a different type of model one that is
called living off the land the
Polynesian voyagers really understood
this concept up into this point when
they began voyage across the oceans
maybe a thousand years ago mankind was
moving along the continents through land
bridges but the Polynesian voyagers in a
sense became the first astronauts they
went in uncharted oceans in the Pacific
between Polynesia Easter Island the
Hawaiian Islands and back that great
triangle and when they meet these made
these journeys they didn&#39;t take years
and years to supplies with them of food
and water and clothes they took just
enough to make the journey to where they
would get to the destination and then
once arriving there they would live off
the land
we call this a very special name in situ
resource utilization in situ meaning
that where you are the location you are
resource utilization meaning to use
those resources where you are to sustain
yourself over a long period of time and
the water becomes the big game changer
it is the gold of space because not only
can we drink it but we can separate the
water into its elemental components of
hydrogen and oxygen we can breathe the
oxygen but we can also use the gases of
hydrogen oxygen for reactants for fuel
cell for energy but most importantly we
can use it for propellant cryogenic
hydrogen and cryogenic oxygen are the
most powerful propellants for rocket
engines so what this allows us to do is
not have to lift all the propellant in a
rocket to escape earth we can just put
enough to get away from earth and then
refill up at a gas station a fill Depot
in or around the moon to allow our
planetary journeys to continue
construction material is very similar in
resource utilization well we go to moon
in Mars to make these outposts or
settlements we&#39;re not going to take
steel and an iron with us from the earth
we&#39;re not going to take rebar we&#39;re not
gonna go to Home Depot and load a bunch
of lumber in a spaceship and launch it
to Mars ain&#39;t gonna happen it&#39;s just not
gonna be like that
we&#39;ll use what&#39;s there we use the
volcanic material the the lava the
basalt for building landing pads for
shelters for roads for sidewalks and our
whole thinking of civil engineering has
to change because now on Mars were in
140 on the moon we&#39;re in 160 so what
does that mean in terms of construction
standards and codes for load bearing
wallets and non load-bearing walls on
those areas and of course we&#39;ll also use
this for materials on on the for making
electronics and tools and then also
resource prosper
we want to go find out what the water
where the water is what is the
constituency of the water what does it
look like where is the best place to
mine we&#39;re the easiest place to have
access and are there some places that we
could build a landing or an outpost site
that&#39;s co-located with some of these
deposits so prospecting much less in the
gold rush days and the this time instead
of for water is going to be critical in
this in this resource utilization effort
and then lastly using resources on men
or Mars to make solar rays to collect
solar energy for power and also thermal
energy for keeping warm at night the the
concept of this is very interesting as
we see some of the these mission
scenarios play out in almost every case
that I see humans don&#39;t go first like we
did in Apollo the robots and Rovers go
first to prospect and find the water and
begin assembling the outpost to make
landing pads all robotically to begin
putting the outpost and hooking them
together like Lego sets to build
infrastructure and sidewalks and then
the humans come to work side-by-side
with the humans so let&#39;s envision what
one of those scenarios might be let&#39;s
say we get a large Lander and put down a
very powerful energy system because you
can&#39;t do anything without power that&#39;s
number one and secondly we would have a
high bandwidth communication device on
the spacecraft to allow us to do tell a
robotic operations from Earth to all
these Rovers the robots that are doing
the construction for us and then much
like a military sortie when we go into a
remote area we want to collate co-locate
all those assets right so we&#39;ll bring
down our second Lander close to the
first Lander and all that sounds great
doesn&#39;t it but it doesn&#39;t work that way
on Moon and Mars here on earth when we
fire a rocket engine and it interfaces
with the dust of Earth the thick
atmosphere of Earth creates these big
dust clouds these boiling clouds but on
Mars and the moon where there&#39;s little
or no atmosphere it doesn&#39;t work that
way at all and
act on the Moon and Mars instead of
billowing clouds is the very thick sheet
of very tense dense dust the dust on the
moon is about a hundred and fifty
microns in diameter it&#39;s about the size
of talcum powder like flour but it&#39;s not
soft like talc it&#39;s very brittle very
hard it&#39;s it&#39;s essentially shards of
broken glass over millions of years
micro meteorites and cosmic rays have
just broken all the lunar soil up in the
Marcille into very small fragments so
you&#39;ve got this very thick dust sheet of
glass that is about two degrees off the
horizon very close to the horizon and it
travels close to 2,000 meters per second
almost escape velocity for the moon far
faster than a sandblaster in the Apollo
days that&#39;s interesting the astronauts
tell me that when the engines were
running just after touchdown these dust
sheets were created and they could see
the tops of boulders very clearly but
the dust sheet and blow was obscured by
this dense sheet and when the engines
stopped they could see the tail of the
dust sheet heading away from the lunar
spacecraft and then out and over the
horizon incredible so it&#39;s a major
problem because anything that&#39;s in line
of side of that fast-moving dust sheet
solar arrays radiators Rovers
settlements could just be blown away
destroyed so this has led us to a
requirement that we need to first off
when we get there build a landing pad to
stabilize the surface to control the
dust this is one that we built
robotically in Hawaii about 18 months
ago we got similar material dust in
Hawaii this light Moon and Mars we
cooked it in a kiln and made one foot by
one foot pavers like brick pavers each
weighing about 20 pounds and then the
rover with a front blade did leveling
and grading and compaction just like we
would do a sidewalk or a street and then
a robotic arm put these 100 pavers down
in a 10 by 10 matrix to make a landing
pad but I intentionally did not grout in
between the gaps of the pavers because I
wanted to see
what would happen in worst case with
gaps if we did a rocket engine firing so
I went and bought a 2000 pound rocket
engine put it on a fixed service
structure of gantry over the landing pad
and lit the thing off and this is what
it looked like the gases got down in
between the the pavers and you see the
pad lift and settle and then lift again
with the gases and then it&#39;s just throws
these 20-pound pavers around like tinker
toys it was amazing I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d
have that much damage
and I went ah you know this is a good
you know back to the drawing board
you know it did quite work like I
thought it was going to work totally
destroyed the pad and you know what also
figured out is is that unlike the space
shuttle program that I directed when we
go to settle on Moon and Mars we need
different academic skills we need civil
engineers we need architects we need
geologists and volcanologists or
roboticists we need people that
understand farming and and growing
plants inside domes like we saw in the
Martian so it&#39;s a whole new thinking
also of skills that we need when we go
to Moon and Mars and then interesting
enough there&#39;s also the concept of doing
3d printing to make these shelters
today&#39;s technology I don&#39;t know if you
know but we can 3d print a house with
concrete in 48 hours with conduit so we
could take that same approach to the
moon instead of using concrete we use
the batch material that is the fine
grain the flour that&#39;s on Moon and Mars
to make these shelters and so as we look
forward to going to Moon and Mars we&#39;re
gonna have a little different mindset I
am a child of Apollo as many of you are
I I was two or three years short of
being able to work on the lunar programs
the moon has very always been very
passionate to me I think in the next few
years we&#39;re going to be seeing
technology demonstrations on the moon
that lay the groundwork for settlements
for on the Moon and Mars
imagine making the first brick on the
moon or drilling for the first time on
the moon or figuring out what kind of
ice it is on the moon we just don&#39;t know
but it&#39;s going to lead us in all these
concepts as we test them in the close
proximity of the moon to earth as we
develop and feed-forward those concepts
for settlement on Mars so as we say in
Hawaii Mahalo Nui lo ah thank you very
much for allowing me to come and share
with you today Mahalo
