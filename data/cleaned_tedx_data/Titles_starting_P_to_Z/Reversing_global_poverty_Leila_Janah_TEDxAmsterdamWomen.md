what an honor it is to be back here in
the city of social impact
speaking about give work so I want to
start with what I hope is a hopeful fact
which is that the world is actually
getting better despite all of the
headlines on indicators of poverty and
other aspects of human well-being we&#39;re
actually better than we&#39;ve been at any
time since the dawn of Agriculture and
yet we still have a persistent problem
which is that we still have over a
billion people living on less than about
a dollar a day and when I share those
numbers that&#39;s actually adjusted for
purchasing power so that&#39;s what a dollar
would buy you in the u.s. in 2011 in an
average City so this deep poverty is the
root cause of so many of the issues that
we try to solve downstream through
philanthropy issues like the lack of
clean water issues like the fact that
300,000 women are dying in childbirth
around the world each year and the main
cause of this is poverty the World
Health Organization estimates that 99
percent of these deaths are due to
poverty it&#39;s why we have close to a
billion people living without access to
clean water and over 2 billion people
living without access to sanitation
let me humanize this for you this is a
young man named Ken ki Hara and his
daughter Rosaline and I met Ken several
years ago in Masari which is a giant
slum in Kenya where over half a million
people live on less than a few dollars a
day now Ken was actually a success story
he had gotten a scholarship and made it
to one of the best high schools in Kenya
and even managed to graduate and you
would think that this would be Ken&#39;s
happily ever after&#39; story no longer will
he end up a statistic he&#39;ll go on and
get a good job and move his family out
of the slum however like so many young
people in developing countries where
there&#39;s very high youth unemployment in
Kenya it&#39;s 70% ken was forced after
graduating from high school and speaking
beautiful English to move back to the
slum and join the informal economy
now the informal economy is how over a
billion people around the world work and
still earn less than a dollar a day
they&#39;re doing things like picking trash
up off the side of the road and selling
it to the local recycler or doing what
these young men are doing in the photo
they&#39;re actually brewing a local kind of
moonshine called chunga and that sounds
fun and like a good side job except when
you realize what chunga is made of they
actually mix it with kerosene and ken
told me that people in the slum drink
the substance to forget themselves so
this is what an educated young man in
urban Kenya was forced to do because he
couldn&#39;t find work now our typical
approach to helping someone like Ken
involves charity right we think the best
thing to do is build his community oh
well or build them a school and maybe
their lives are going to be a little bit
better and this way of thinking became
institutionalized in the international
aid movement which really started
believe it or not with Americans
sending aid to Europe after World War
two the term care package which you may
have heard of originated in this era
during the Marshall Plan when war-torn
Europe was receiving food aid from the
West or from from the US and what
happened after Europe started recovering
is all of these nongovernmental
organizations that had started to share
this food aid started sending it
elsewhere outside of Europe to places
like sub-saharan Africa and Asia and so
over the last 60 years over a trillion
dollars of development related Aid has
been transferred from wealthy countries
to sub-saharan Africa alone and yet we
have not seen a rise in per capita
incomes for the poorest people we still
have over 350 million people just like
Ken who are still living on less than a
dollar a day despite this massive aid
transfer what&#39;s wrong with this picture
well it turns out that
government-to-government aid transfers
don&#39;t often reach the people that
they&#39;re intended to help people like Ken
and the challenge is that these models
create cycles of dependency and robbed
people of the sort of agency that can
only be provided when you give them cash
directly the
are two ways to give cash directly we
can give handouts and believe it or not
statistics are showing us now that even
handouts of direct cash to low-income
people like Ken are better than the
traditional aid model but even better
than handouts where possible is to give
work when we give work we not only
ensure that poor families are able to
pay for their own expenses to pay for
their own food and water and clothing
and schooling but we give them the sense
of agency that comes with deciding where
you want to invest your paycheck and
even more importantly work strengthens
people&#39;s relationship with their
government imagine if you&#39;re running a
country in Africa and the majority of
your budget is coming from foreign aid
donors who are you going to be
accountable your own population or the
people who are paying for your budget
so Aid creates an unhealthy relationship
between government leaders and foreign
donors and giving work creates a much
healthier relationship between people
who for the first time get taxed as part
of the formal economic system then they
start demanding things people like Ken
will say why are you not building a well
you&#39;re not fixing the pothole on my road
to work why are there poor public buses
in Nairobi so work creates
accountability and agency now thanks to
the internet and all of this new
technology infrastructure we have a
really powerful way to provide work to
people like Ken this is an image of me
by the side of the road in northern
Uganda a couple of years ago it&#39;s not a
place where you would imagine there to
be a tech hub when you hear people say
that the internet is rolling out in a
new geography this is literally what it
looks like this is me standing next to a
pool of a spool of fiber-optic cable
that was getting rolled out across
northern Uganda over 10,000 miles of
this cable have been placed in East
Africa in the last couple of years and
what that means is that for the first
time in human history
someone like Ken can transcend the
accident of geography that led him to
being born in Mathari and work for
companies anywhere this is a
fundamentally liberating force if we can
apply it for social good and so see
this trend I decided to start an
organization that would harness this
type of work several years ago what kind
of work is now possible with the
internet being cheap and widely
available in places like northern Uganda
well one growing field is called
computer vision this is the field that
enables technologies like self-driving
cars and by 2019
the computer vision industry will reach
33 billion dollars one example of a task
that&#39;s needed to train algorithms
powering self-driving cars is tagging
images this is a picture of a road and
this is the annotation of that image
that is then sent to a machine learning
team that&#39;s powering self-driving cars
so this image is actually teaching the
machine to recognize objects and images
and you can see how someone who&#39;s
finished high school but doesn&#39;t have
much training in the formal economy
could quickly learn how to do this type
of work I formed an organization called
samasource
in late 2008 our first check actually
came from the Dutch postcode lottery
believe it or not and we are a nonprofit
organization committed to connecting
low-income people like Ken to digital
work to move them out of poverty since
we started we have signed contracts with
some of the biggest companies in the
world and they signed contracts with us
because the quality of this work done by
people like Ken is actually quite high
we&#39;ve pioneered this model in urban
areas like Nairobi where all of our
workers come from slum communities all
the way to rural centres like this
Center which was also funded by the
Dutch government and now has provided
employment for over 400 people making us
the largest technology employer in
northern Uganda an area mostly known for
brutal civil war what&#39;s most remarkable
is the personal transformation people
make when they move out of poverty our
workers on average are starting below
the poverty line at 2 dollars and 20
cents a day which means they don&#39;t have
access to decent health care their
primary source of calories we actually
measure this in surveys is sugar cane
it&#39;s the cheapest source of calories you
can get in a slum and they don&#39;t have
access to decent schooling because they
can&#39;t even afford uniforms or books
average three years after samasource
people have maintained an over $8 a day
income so about a four-fold increase in
income and what&#39;s remarkable is how
they&#39;re spending this money they&#39;re
investing it on the health and education
often of children living at home and
women in particular are known around the
world to reinvest 90% of their paycheck
into the health and education of their
own children and the betterment of their
communities there&#39;s no better aid
program than buying from women we have
now used this model to move 36 thousand
people out of poverty and keep them
there and what&#39;s so exciting is that
this model can be replicated around the
world because we actually became
profitable as a social enterprise last
year we&#39;ve started a version of our
model in the u.s. that can be exported
globally called sama school especially
in economies like here in Europe where
most of the net employment growth is
happening in the freelance economy in
this rise of workers who are no longer
part of a formal job so this model can
absolutely work here and this is an
example of someone who we&#39;ve worked with
in the US grace grace has been able to
increase her income fourfold by doing
this work hourly and she&#39;s a military
veteran yeah which is a very
marginalized community back home in the
u.s. I&#39;m gonna end on the note of scale
how do we take this movement even
further it turns out that the biggest
2000 companies in the world the global
2000 spent 12 trillion dollars annually
on goods and services this is money
that&#39;s spent on everything from rugs to
the fair trade coffee hopefully in their
lunch rooms if we&#39;re able to marshal
just a tiny percentage of this 12
trillion dollars to spend it on social
enterprises like samasource imagine the
difference we could make in the world so
my mission is to get big companies
around the world not just aid
organizations to shift but big companies
to shift towards a model of giving work
rather than giving aid and I think we
have a much greater potential to change
the world through giving work thank you
so much
[Applause]
