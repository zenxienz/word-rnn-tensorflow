like a lot of kids born in the early 70s
I had the good fortune to be raised by
hippies one of my childhood heroes was
Stuart brand Stuart is not only one of
the original hippies he&#39;s also one of
the first modern environmentalists of
the 1960s and 70s as a young boy one of
my favorite memories is playing
cooperative games that Stuart designed
as an antidote to the Vietnam War I&#39;m
from a long line of Christian pacifists
known as Mennonites and every August we
would go as kids to remember the US
government&#39;s atomic bombing of Japan by
lighting candles and sending them on
boats onto bittersweet Park as I
graduated from high school throughout
college I brought many delegations to
Central America to bring diplomacy seek
peace and also to support local farmer
cooperatives in Guatemala Central
America Nicaragua and over time as I&#39;ve
traveled around the world been through
many small communities on all the
different continents I&#39;ve come to
appreciate that the young people I
interview they don&#39;t want to be stuck in
the village they don&#39;t want to spend
their whole lives chopping wood and
hauling wood they want to go to the city
for opportunity most of them do for
education for work and what I&#39;ve
realized is that that process of
urbanization of moving to the city is
actually very positive for nature it
allows the natural environment to come
back it allows for the Central African
mountain gorillas for example an
important endangered species to have the
habitats that they need to survive and
thrive and of course in that process
you&#39;ve got to go vertical
so even places like Hong Kong you see
can spare their natural environment
around the city but it requires a huge
amount of energy to go up and so the big
challenge of our time is how do you get
plentiful reliable electricity and
energy without destroying the climate
well I started out as an anti-nuclear
activist and I quickly got involved in
advocating for renewable energy so at
the early part of the the this century I
hope to start a labor union and
environmentalist alliance called the
Apollo Alliance and we pushed for a big
investment in clean energy solar wind
electric cars and the investment idea
was picked up by President Obama and
during his time in office he invested
about 150 billion dollars to make solar
and wind and electric car is much
cheaper than they were and that was
having a lot of success but we were
starting to notice some challenges some
of them you&#39;re familiar with solar and
wind generate electricity about 10 to 30
percent of the time so we&#39;re dependent
on on the weather for solar and wind
there were other problems we were
noticing though sometimes these sources
of electricity generate too much power
and you hear a lot of hype about
batteries but we actually don&#39;t have
sufficient storage even in California
where we have a lot of investment a lot
of Silicon Valley types putting money
into battery storage technology so we&#39;re
trying to figure out how do you manage
all those renewables and while we were
struggling with this problem around 2005
Stewart Brand came out and he said we
should rethink nuclear power and this
was like a shock to the system I mean
for me and for all of my friends I mean
Stewart was one of the first big
advocates of solar energy anywhere in
the late 60s and early 70s he advised
the governor of California but he said
look you know we&#39;ve been trying to do
solar for a long time and at the time so
we have less than you know less than 1/2
a percent of our electricity globally
comes from solar about 2% from wind and
majority comes from nuclear and hydro
and he said look you know despite what
you might think according to the
intergovernmental panel on climate
change nuclear actually produces 4 times
less carbon emissions than solar does
and in fact that&#39;s why they recommended
in their most recent report that
achieving deep cuts in emissions is
going to require more intensive use of
renewables nuclear and carbon capture
and storage well let&#39;s take a closer
look at Germany so Germany gets the
majority of its electricity and of
course all of its transportation fuels
from fossil fuels so just the electrical
sector last year Germany got 40% of its
electricity from coal it got 12% from
natural gas 13% from nuclear 12% from
wind and about 6% from solar so to go
from 18% wind and solar to 100% you
actually had to go beyond that if
replacing all of the transportation
sector with electric cars you&#39;re looking
at something more like a hundred and
fifty percent so Germany&#39;s done a lot to
invest in renewables and to innovate
solar and wind but that&#39;s a still a
pretty steep climb that&#39;s even before
you get to the question of storage so
well let&#39;s take a look at what happened
last year last year Germany installed
four percent more solar panels but it
generated three percent less electricity
from solar and I&#39;m even when I&#39;m in
meetings with energy experts the last
people if they can make a guess as to
why that is and you&#39;d be shocked at how
many energy experts have no idea it just
wasn&#39;t very sunny last year in Germany
well that probably meant though then
that it was windier right because if
it&#39;s not as sunny then maybe there&#39;s
some more wind and those two things can
balance each other out in truth Germany
installed 11 percent more wind turbines
in 2016 but it got 2 percent less
electricity from wind same story just
not very windy last year so you might
think well we just have to do a lot more
solar and wind so that in years where
there&#39;s not a lot of sunlight and wind
that there&#39;s more electricity from those
energy sources so Germany&#39;s plan is to
increase by 50 percent the amount of
electricity Germany gets from solar that
would take you from you know 40
gigawatts to about 60 gigawatts in 2030
but if you have a year like 2016 that
means that you&#39;ll still only be getting
around 9 percent of your atoll
electricity from solar and this isn&#39;t
really the biggest solar country in the
world I mean Germany is really the
powerhouse of renewable electricity so
the obvious response is well we&#39;ll just
put it all in batteries we hear so much
about batteries you would think that
we&#39;re just have a huge amount of storage
well our staff took a look at the
numbers in California and what we
discovered is that we have 23 minutes of
electricity storage for California&#39;s
grid but that require to get that 23
minutes requires using every battery in
every car and truck in the state which
as you can imagine it&#39;s not super
practical if you&#39;re trying to get
somewhere and Germany might be a little
bit different but not very different
from that well most people are aware
that to make this transition towards
renewables
Germany has been spending a lot more on
electricity and you can see electricity
prices in Germany rose about 50 percent
over the last 10 years today German
electricity is about 2 times more
expensive than electricity is in France
and you might think look that&#39;s a small
price to pay for dealing with climate
change and I would agree with that
spending a little bit more money on
energy especially for those of us in the
rich world is a decent thing to do to
avert some of the catastrophic
possibilities of global warming but the
interesting thing is is that when you
look and when you compare France and
Germany in terms of their electricity
France gets 93% of their electricity
from clean energy sources mostly hydro
and nuclear Germany gets just 46% like
about half and here&#39;s the real shocking
thing German carbon emissions have
actually been going up since 2009 they
have increased over the last two years
and they may increase this year as well
and German carbon emissions have
declined since the 1990s but most of
that is just due to the fact that after
reunification Germany just took off line
all of those inefficient coal plants in
East Germany most of that reduction is
just due to that and let&#39;s take a look
at last year one of the things that
really quickly can reduce emissions is
switching from coal to natural gas
because natural gas is about half of the
carbon intensity of coal and that would
have resulted in a pretty significant
reduction in German carbon emissions
last year except for the fact that
Germany took offline nuclear and when it
did that it meant that the emissions
actually ended up going up again now
there&#39;s some questions about what about
the future so if we just do more solar
and wind won&#39;t it kind of all work
itself out well one of the biggest
challenges to this has come from
somebody here in Germany who is not a
pro nuclear person at all is energy
analysts and economists namely on earth
and what he finds is that that problem I
described earlier where sometimes you
have too much wind at certain parts of
the day or certain parts of the year or
too much solar and not clear what to do
with it
but that reduces the economic value of
wind and solar so wind actually the
value of it reduces 40 percent once it
gets to be 30 percent of your
electricity and solar it&#39;s even more
dramatic it actually declines by
half when it gets just 15% so one of the
things you hear though is that well we
can do a solar roof like really fast
I mean Solar is fast you just put it up
on one day and you&#39;ve installed the
thing whereas it takes like ten years or
five years depending on where you are to
build a nuclear plant and so that makes
sense you&#39;d think well if we do solar
wind you can just go a lot faster but
this was actually studied in an
important article for the journal
Science last year one of the lead
authors one of the authors was James
Hansen the famous climate scientist and
what they found is that even when you
combine solar and wind you just get a
lot less clean electricity than when you
do nuclear and that goes for Germany as
well as the United States so what they
did is they just compared the ten years
of the most deployment of those two
technologies solar wind versus nuclear
and it&#39;s a pretty stark comparison well
I can see what you&#39;re imagining because
it&#39;s what I was sort of thinking it was
like well this sounds like I now have to
really reconsider my attitudes around
nuclear power but then what about
Chernobyl what about Fukushima what
about all the nuclear waste those are
really reasonable questions to ask and
in fact when I was trying to ask them
there were other people that were
starting to change their mind one of the
ones who I was most impressed by and was
very influential is a British newspaper
columnist named
George Monbiot George Monbiot wrote a
column shortly after Fukushima where he
went through the scientific research on
radiation and what he wrote was the
anti-nuclear movement to which I once
belonged has misled the world about the
impacts of radiation on human health I
write some pretty harsh things sometimes
but this was a pretty strong call and he
was talking to a number of scientists
that actually have studied the big
accidents one of them is Jerry Thomas
from Imperial College in London Jerry
started something called the Chernobyl
tissue bank out of her concern for the
accident and totally independent
professor of pathology at Imperial
College and she I asked her I said you
know I said I wanna I&#39;d like to present
this but I&#39;m not radiation scientists so
can I just steal your slides I&#39;ll put
your picture on them if you let me do
that
the first thing she points out that she
says most ionizing radiation that&#39;s the
radiation that is potentially harmful
that comes from a nuclear accident most
of it&#39;s natural and I was like well that
sounds alright you know I like natural
foods natural radiation sounds good
the hot springs you know and she said no
actually natural ionizing radiation is
just as harmful potentially as
artificial radiation so that&#39;s kind of
the first thing the striking thing about
it is that the total amount of ionizing
radiation were exposed to from not just
Chernobyl and Fukushima but also all of
the atomic bomb testing in the 60s and
70s totals just 0.3 percent of our
exposures most of the radiation were
exposed to is just from the earth or
from the atmosphere or from the
buildings around us let&#39;s look at the
big one
this is Chernobyl this is the event that
really scared me about nuclear and led
me to be an anti-nuclear activist United
Nations has done these very large
comprehensive studies they have hundreds
of scientists around the world that do
this research so the possibility of
somebody fudging the data or maybe
trying to cover something up is pretty
low in that environment just because
there&#39;s so many different credit you
know credible scientists at different
universities around the world doing the
research so this is really I think was a
pivotal moment for me Chernobyl is the
worst nuclear accident we&#39;ve ever had
and I think there&#39;s some people that say
it&#39;s the worst we could ever have I
don&#39;t need to make a statement that
strong but they literally had a nuclear
reactor without a containment dome and
it was on fire like it was like just
raining radiation around everybody you
know it was a really terrible accident
and when they start counting bodies what
they come up with is 28 deaths from
acute radiation syndrome 15 deaths over
the last 25 years from the thyroid
cancer which as horrible as it sounds
it&#39;s actually the best cancer to get
because hardly anybody dies from it it&#39;s
really treatable you can take thyroxine
which is a synthetic substitute get a
surgery effect most of the people that
died were people that were in remote
rural areas that couldn&#39;t get the
medical treatment they needed and if you
take the 16,000 people that hat that got
thyroid cancer from Chernobyl they
estimate 160 of them will die from
thyroid cancer and it&#39;s like they&#39;re
dying like right now like they&#39;ll die of
it in old age and that&#39;s not to say that
it&#39;s okay but it is to put it in some
kind of context there&#39;s no scientific
evidence of thyroid cancer outside of
those three main countries Belarus
Ukraine Russia no effect on fertility
malformations infant mortality no
conclusion of no data for adverse
pregnancy outcomes no evidence for any
genetic effects and I think this last
one is the most striking thing there&#39;s
no evidence of any increase in cancer
including in the cohort of people who
put the fire out and cleaned up
afterwards and I I said I saw him
surprised by this finding and so I put
the link to the website on there I don&#39;t
think you should take my word for it I
think you should go read it because just
reading about Chernobyl for me was a big
part of changing my mind about nuclear
power
well what about Fukushima this was also
the second worst nuclear disaster in
history there was a much smaller release
of radiation than Chernobyl and so what
we find is that no deaths from radiation
exposure from Fukushima which is kind of
amazing 1,500 people died being pulled
out of nursing homes being pulled out of
hospitals it was insane it was a panic
the Japanese government should not have
done that it violated every standard of
how you deal with a disaster like that
you&#39;re supposed to shelter in place in
fact by pulling people out of their
homes and moving them around outside
during that accident they actually
exposed to a little more radiation and
and of course you have to put that in
comparison to the other things that were
going on like 15 to 20 thousand people
dying instantly from drowning pinned
under many different technologies by the
way getting killed by that tsunami
unlikely be any increase in thyroid
cancer and the big problems of course is
just the stress and the fear that you&#39;ve
got you&#39;ve been contaminated when the
evidence suggests that that&#39;s not the
case at all they did an interesting
study they brought a bunch of school
kids from Paris to Fukushima and they
worked as senators that&#39;s what we call
the old Geiger counters now and what
they find is that those kids when they
go through the security systems the
radiation would spike when they&#39;d get on
the airplane to fly to Tokyo the
radiation was spiked they&#39;d go to the
French Embassy the radiation would spike
a walk you didn&#39;t get the walkie as a
city it didn&#39;t get the the plume the
radioactive plume Tomioka did and it&#39;s
still a tiny blip compared to just going
through the security system so let&#39;s
look at some of the basics to put this
in context if you live in a big city
like London or Berlin or New York
you&#39;re gonna increase your mortality
risk by 2.8 percent just from air
pollution alone if you live with someone
who smokes cigarettes 1.7 percent but if
you were somebody that cleaned up
Chernobyl got exposed to 250
millisieverts of radiation 1% 100
millisieverts 0.4% it&#39;s just because
there just wasn&#39;t as much radiation as
people think I mean the atomic bomb
testing in the sixties exposed people to
just there&#39;s so many different
measurements for radiation you can just
see a lot more radiation exposure during
the a-bomb test than either Chernobyl or
Fukushima I think the key thing here is
I&#39;m from the state of Colorado in the
United States we have an annual exposure
just because there&#39;s so much granite
around us about 9 millisieverts a year
that&#39;s what you would get if you are the
six million people that live around
Chernobyl today and yet of course nobody
knows this like here&#39;s this really basic
science is right there on the website
but when you go into a survey in most
countries this one was done in Russia
only eight percent of the population
that surveyed accurately predicts the
death toll from Chernobyl and zero
percent predicted accurately the death
toll from Fukushima meanwhile sitting
right before us is 7 million deaths a
year from air pollution and the evidence
on particulate matter causing harm has
only gotten stronger over the years so
that&#39;s why every major medical journal
that looks at this this is from the
British Medical Journal Lancet finds
that nuclear power is already the safest
way to make electricity and it leads to
this really uncomfortable conclusion one
that the climate scientist James Hansen
came to recently which is that
nuclear power has actually saved 1.8
million lives it&#39;s not something that
you hear very much about so what about
the waste well this is the waste from a
nuclear plant the United States the
thing about the nuclear waste is it&#39;s
the only waste from electricity
production that is safely contained
anywhere all of the other waste goes
into the environment from coal gas and
then here&#39;s sort of a equally
uncomfortable conclusion solar panels
there&#39;s no plan to recycle solar panels
outside of the EU meaning that all of us
in California it&#39;s just gonna join the
waste stream we calculated well how much
toxic waste because the panels contain
heavy metals and lead and chromium and
cadmium how much toxic waste from solar
is there well the get a sense of it look
at how much more materials are required
for each different energy source and
when you calculate all the panels
that&#39;ll require to produce the same
amount of electricity is nuclear solar
actually produces 300 times more waste
than nuclear very little of it contained
and all of it containing toxic heavy
metals what about the weapons if I
thought there was any chance that more
nuclear power would increase the chance
of nuclear war I would be against it
I&#39;ve always been a pacifist I still AM
diplomacy is always almost always the
right solution well people say well what
about North Korea Korea proves the point
in order to get nuclear power right now
I mean it&#39;s been this way for 50 years
you have to agree not to get a weapon
that&#39;s the deal
South Korea wanted nuclear power they
agreed not to get a weapon they don&#39;t
have a weapon North Korea wanted nuclear
power I think they should have gotten it
we didn&#39;t let them have it for a variety
of reasons they got a bomb they now are
testing missiles that can hit Japan they
can hit a totally soon they&#39;ll be able
to hit California so if nuclear energy
led to nuclear bombs it&#39;s no evidence
for it not only in Korea but nowhere so
where does that leave us
well I think it leaves us with some
uncomfortable ideas I mean if Germany
hadn&#39;t closed its nuclear plants its
emissions would be 43 percent lower than
it is today and I think if you care
about climate change that&#39;s at least
something that you have to wrestle with
in light of some of these facts about
the harms and benefits of different
energy sources and I&#39;ll end with a quote
from somebody else who changed his mind
and somebody else who was a huge
childhood hero for me and that&#39;s sting
if you&#39;re gonna tackle global warming
nuclear is the only way you can create
massive amounts of power thank you very
much appreciation
