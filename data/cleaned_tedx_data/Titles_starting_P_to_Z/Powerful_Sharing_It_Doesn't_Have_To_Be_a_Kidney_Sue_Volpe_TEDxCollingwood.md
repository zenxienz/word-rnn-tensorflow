so when I was 22 I decided to ditch my
plans for Law School and check out the
entertainment industry I just needed to
know if it was for me so I left school
said goodbye to my family in small town
su st. Marie Canada yes they were having
a heart attack and bought a one-way
ticket to LA I didn&#39;t know anyone but I
didn&#39;t care
I knew it&#39;s what I needed to do that&#39;s
where I met the Caesar family I was
hired by a nanny agency to do
babysitting work for them we clicked
immediately I just fell in love with
them they became my la family if I ever
needed anything I called them and trust
me their phone rang I was just a kid
right and broke and alone fast-forward
22 years later I spent 11 of those years
in LA then spent a few years in Victoria
BC and then settled into beautiful
Collingwood Ontario life has moved on
marriage children divorce the scissors
and I always kept in touch they were a
part of my tribe but you know how it is
we could go years without seeing each
other or even talking but no matter what
there was always that connection and I
knew we were always there for each other
last year January 27 2016 I saw a post
on Facebook from Andy the husband he was
pleading for his wife&#39;s life Randy had a
genetic kidney disease the very same one
that kills her father when she was only
2 now both of her kidneys were failing
and she needed a new kidney the doctors
at UCLA told her she had one month to a
year to find one that had been three
months prior because it was a genetic
disease nobody in her family qualified
and her husband was on medication so he
couldn&#39;t help my god like my heart sank
I had no idea time was running out and
Randy was dying I needed to help her I
knew I could
in my mind I knew I was the person to do
this I had spent my entire life taking
excellent care of my health in my body
what better way to make use of that so
right away I called up Andy and I&#39;m like
Andy oh my god why didn&#39;t you tell me
why didn&#39;t you ask me and he was like um
what like yeah of course I&#39;ve got to she
can have one of mine so he referred me
to the UCLA website where I had to
officially applied to be a donor be
assigned a coordinator and then begin
the process of determining if I was
eligible only 17% of all people who
apply to be donors actually get accepted
so while I was waiting to hear back from
my coordinator I spent hours and days
doing as much research and learning as
much as I could yes I wanted this to
happen but it also had to be good for me
my kids in my life so as I had expected
if you&#39;re healthy and they only accept
extraordinarily healthy people you can
live a very happy healthy and long life
with only one kidney as a matter of fact
most kidney donors live longer than the
average population maybe it&#39;s because
we&#39;re healthier in the first place
or maybe it&#39;s because doing something
good makes you happier therefore live
longer so I really trusted UCLA they had
a great world-renowned reputation I felt
safe with them so my decision was made
up as long as my family was ok with this
I was going to do it so I proceeded to
share my decision with the people I love
you know giving them as much information
I could putting them or their minds at
ease making sure I had their support all
the people in my life rock like truly
even if they were afraid they knew I
would never make such a big decision on
gut feeling alone yes my gut may have
prompted this but I substantiated that
knowing with thorough research caring
and a highly competent team of medical
professionals so the first round of
tests came back yes we were a match I
couldn&#39;t believe it of course I knew it
was gonna happen but I was so excited
Randy was going to get my kidney and
then she would be healthy again may be
healthier than ever
we would be like sisters in fact we were
such a match as close as sisters the
only way we could have been closer as if
we were twins
I don&#39;t know pretty cool I do want to
point out though that I had already
decided that even if I wasn&#39;t a match I
would still give one of my kidneys so
that Randy would have one they have
what&#39;s called a paired kidney exchange
program basically it&#39;s like an organ
pool where I give my kidney whoever that
matches they get and then Randy gets one
so it&#39;s pretty cool okay so enter May 11
2016 5 a.m. UCLA Medical Center two of
the strongest and most competent medical
teams in all of North America surgical
teams in all of North America two
patients who had travelled a long
journey of 22 years alongside and apart
from each other soon to be sharing more
than an organ side-by-side we were doing
it no part of this day could have
happened without every single player
playing their part I knew I was exactly
where I needed to be I knew we would ace
this I would go back to my kids in
Canada and Randy would go back to saving
people&#39;s lives as a cardiac critical
care nurse and we did we aced it we were
rock stars as a matter of fact the
surgeon who put my kidney into Randy
came over after the procedure to
introduce himself he said I just have to
meet the owner of this superstar kidney
no I&#39;m serious listen T it may start at
working before he had even finished
putting it in it was like it just needed
to get to work yeah classic zubaba yeah
anyway it&#39;s really cool
so this is our akin me I asked them to
video the procedure or to let me watch
it live but I had us too late next time
so I got home I was only in the hospital
for two nights and Randy was there for
about six or seven here we are the day
she got home from the hospital less than
three and a half months earlier I heard
my friend was going to die but we didn&#39;t
let that happen we all came together and
made this happen instead now Randy is
working long 12-hour shifts as a nurse
at a hospital walking five miles a day
and doing yoga truly amazing what I have
learned from this entire experience is
we need each other
Randy needed me her family her friends
and the entire surgical team could not
have done this without me I was one
small but necessary part of this much
bigger machine so I&#39;m not here to say
you should go out and donate a kidney of
course if you can and you want to go for
it like it&#39;ll change your life forever
but what I am saying is there are tons
of things that we can be doing and we
can be sharing the point is we cannot do
this alone on a micro and a macro level
we have gone too far on insisting on
this independence it&#39;s like this hyper
independence from infancy to elderly
we&#39;ve become obsessed with it and it&#39;s a
faulty system even when we try to force
independence our natural need our
natural desire and our natural wiring
drives us to come together according to
the Smithsonian National Museum of
Natural History coming together is what
has supported us over millions of years
to withstand and survive challenges and
life-threatening situations maybe that&#39;s
why I had a second healthy kidney so I
can ensure Randy&#39;s survival and
therefore ensure the survival of her
future patients
we all have something that someone else
does not have something that can support
our tribe if we choose to you know maybe
you you live next to an overwhelmed
single parent and you can offer to mow
her lawn for a day or for the season you
know maybe you can make some homemade
meals or share your leftovers with with
someone who is elderly or alone you know
maybe you&#39;ve got an extra room in your
house to rent out to accommodate this
rental shortage hey if you&#39;d like to
walk dogs offer to walk your friends dog
you know there are so many things we can
do these things may not seem like big
things to you because you have them but
for the person who doesn&#39;t they are huge
what do you have two of that maybe you
don&#39;t need but someone else does what
can you share starting today if you&#39;re
lucky maybe you too can be one small but
very necessary part of a much bigger
magical machine I hope so
