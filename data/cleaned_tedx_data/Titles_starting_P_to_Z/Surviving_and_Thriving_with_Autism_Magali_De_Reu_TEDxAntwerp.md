so I&#39;m gonna start off with a question
how many of you ever felt
your disabilities blocked you from
chasing your dreams more specifically
your dream career because I know I have
but for me I discovered that life on the
autism spectrum didn&#39;t have to mean a
diminished life as a matter of fact I&#39;m
here to tell you how I use it as a
string to actually help me create and
leave the life and career I want but it
wasn&#39;t always like that when I was young
I mean I&#39;ve been bullied all my life I
was always the odd man out and even
though I realized something was wrong
with me but I just couldn&#39;t identify
what it was so when I was about 14 years
old and I got my diagnosis I had so many
questions and answers at the same time
which was really confusing because
autism is characterized by marked
difficulties in social interaction
behavior communication and sensory
sensitivities and I just assumed that
all of those things apply to me and in
fact it took me about 10 years to find
out that autism or specifically
Asperger&#39;s syndrome is not a
one-size-fits-all condition it can vary
in many ways from person to person and
more specifically from men to women
which is really interesting to prove my
point I&#39;m going to give you three main
characteristics of the autism spectrum
that don&#39;t really apply to me let me
explain
so the first thing is absolutely needing
routine I mean I could use it but I&#39;m I
don&#39;t need it just like 70% of all human
beings right but I remember I had been
told that fear would stress me out and
it kind of became a self-fulfilling
prophecy so change started to stress me
out because I had been told it would
secondly being introverted I mean I
don&#39;t know how many of you know me in
person but I&#39;m not really introverted
type and I will tell you later on about
how I used it to my advantage and the
third thing is shaking things literally
I mean I sometimes do that but I mean
not anymore I guess but because there&#39;s
one situation I remember when my boss
during my last full-time job he was
talking about having to go drain his
potatoes
and I thought are you going to cook
potatoes in the office and obviously he
was just talking about using the
bathroom
which is very funny so it still makes me
laugh so I can hear you think like how
does autism affect her so let me tell
you a little more about more about my so
called weaknesses the first thing is you
may or may not tell but I&#39;m really
socially awkward but as I&#39;m extroverted
and I wear my heart on my sleeve people
just assume that I&#39;m sociable and while
that is very true I&#39;m still not always
aware of social guidelines and
boundaries so whenever I do or say
something that is perceived as offending
people just assume that I&#39;m rude so when
I look back on the past ten years I
can&#39;t tell you how many people I have
insulted without even realizing it the
second thing is my anxiety which is
still a problem for me I mean I&#39;m really
nervous right now my heart is a booth
but I can tell you one thing it has led
to safety seeking behavior reassurance
seeking my self-esteem used to be
defined by what others thought of me and
it&#39;s still kind of an ongoing process
but I&#39;m working on it so I&#39;m happy about
that and the third thing is black and
white thinking I&#39;m really prone to black
and white thinking for me it&#39;s always
been all or nothing I either obsess over
something or I hate it but for a long
time I let these weaknesses define me I
tried to hide them I ran away from them
and still people would notice something
was wrong with me which was very very
frustrating and even though I had my
diagnosis I would still cover up try to
cover up everything autism related both
in my private and professional life
which created a lot of distress for me
my parents who always wanted the best
for me and there&#39;s somewhere here in
raise your hand they also had the best
for me but they often assumed I was
aiming too high whenever I tried to
reach what was too damn unattainable so
they sometimes I mean they often made me
sell off for less obviously with the
best intentions but it kind of
discouraged me from chasing my dreams
and my beliefs sometimes and for me I I
mean I didn&#39;t believe myself either I
was kind of stuck in the middle because
I was too autistic to blend in with the
normal kids but to normal to blending
with the autistic kids and that&#39;s when I
realized that I have autism that&#39;s not
autism or simply put invisible autism
and in general people never believed I
could accomplish anything in my life and
I even remember one guy in college
saying oh she didn&#39;t pass her exams oh
she won&#39;t be stealing my job later
guess who&#39;s laughing now and now I would
like to show you how I used these
weaknesses to how I turn these
weaknesses into strengths for a long
time I was felt really insecure like I
already told you but one time when I
burned out during my last full-time job
I felt like I had no other choice but
doing things for me so I was burned out
and I was like okay now I&#39;m gonna do
things for me for myself and I&#39;m going
to take a giant leap of faith that&#39;s
when I became a freelancer and I did
this in my own typical manner so one day
in May 2015 which is about two and a
half years ago I went to a co-working
space in here in Antwerp with my heavy
laptop a black thing really heavy an
old-fashioned thing and I went to a
bunch of startups over there and I was
like hey I&#39;m a goalie I&#39;m going to
improve your life by writing the best
copy you&#39;ve ever seen and they were like
Mia whatever I&#39;m gonna give her a chance
they obviously like my approach by being
my blunt self they was they were like
okay it&#39;s not another cold call by one
of one of her one of the freelancers out
there so they they gave me a chance
which I&#39;m really grateful
for that was a great start and that&#39;s
how I got the ball rolling but I knew
that I wasn&#39;t there yet because I felt
that I was carrying a lot of baggage for
my past experience and I kept tripping
over it by constantly trying to hide
that autism myself and as I gained more
experience in the field I realized one
thing autism is both a blessing a both a
curse and a blessing at the same time
because I built my personal branding
about my own personality about my own
enthusiastic strange a little bit
awkward personality which means that
people know people who ever works we
know that what they see is what they get
what they see is what they get and I
recently I asked a bunch of customers
why they like working with me and they
all answered
we love your own synthetic personality
even love your honesty and as an
absolute fan of integrity I&#39;m really
happy about that
secondly I have a keen eye for detail
most people with Asperger&#39;s tend to lose
sight of the bigger picture
and I&#39;m often guilty of this during
projects but at the same time whenever
somebody sends me a 10 pages document
long document and there&#39;s one spelling
mistake in it I will have seen it and
the third thing is I&#39;m a perfectionist
so once I go for it I go for it and if I
want something bad enough I will succeed
I mean I&#39;m not I know this isn&#39;t always
necessarily a good thing but my ambition
is what of is what has gotten me so far
today so far so far today whatever what
I&#39;ve learned in the past and today what
still drives me is that to work with
what you have to offer you got to find
that thing that makes you get out of bed
every morning your true passion it may
sound like a huge cliche as a matter of
fact it is a cliche but passion is my
mantra and if I often say if I can do
everybody else can that doesn&#39;t mean you
have to you know you have to sell it for
less because I believe that everyone has
to keep pushing keep evolving for me the
one thing that I do every day is
learning I just keep learning as soon as
learning stops there&#39;s no challenge and
if there&#39;s no challenge it means that
you&#39;re taking things for granted and the
most important part for me is that every
batch rate can mean something good too
like for me again the blunt personality
it&#39;s what makes my collaborations with
other clients and with people work solo
and I&#39;m really happy about that and then
today I still try to do things that make
me different not just by by I mean not
just professionally but also by doing
things in my own way it&#39;s not just about
finding a niche it&#39;s about designing
your very own USP let me give you an
example today I read copy for tech
startups and larger companies and media
outlets but I do this by involving
emotions like not just writing the facts
but I involve emotions people emotions
like I am doing right now with my own
and if there&#39;s one conclusion I&#39;ve made
over the past few years it&#39;s that it&#39;s
that disabilities come in all varieties
I mean they don&#39;t even have to have a
name but truth is it&#39;s not a matter
matter of accepting those disabilities
if it&#39;s a matter of turning them into
your assets and advantages and that&#39;s
when and if you can do that you&#39;re going
to get really far I think I&#39;m living
proof of that
