so who of you ever has done yoga please
raise your hands
okay keep them up keep them up with and
mindfulness or a meditation course or
something maybe what look around you
it&#39;s pretty much huh okay lower than
that so we&#39;re talking today about
bridging the gap between the past the
present and the future and I would like
to guide you into this present moment
right here and therefore I brought this
beautiful instrument
it&#39;s a cello from 1720 speaking about
the past it&#39;s here now and when I played
this beautiful instrument I really feel
this soul
this vibration resonance as this as if
it&#39;s a human being well we are human
beings although we sometimes act like
human doings we do a lot we talk a lot
we think a lot we share a lot we inspire
a lot and we also do forget to take a
break sometimes and we really need that
break to rest to pause to breathe so
that&#39;s where I want to focus on with you
so let&#39;s all inhale deeply and take a
very satisfying
exhale and in Netherlands we often say
hey well we have done something so let&#39;s
do it all together inhale
does it feel good I think because we
forget to take a break I think that&#39;s
why yoga mindfulness is getting more
popular every day because we need this
break to keep on doing keep on spreading
our IDs or whatever we do because we&#39;re
busy very much so I&#39;m gonna play more
cello for you and I will sing along and
the only thing you have to well do is
focus on your breath that&#39;s the only
thing are you ready for that um and
another powerful tool to be here and now
it&#39;s focused on this on this bread and
also maybe he&#39;s so already I wear
nothing bare feet to feet on the ground
is also very helpful so if you want to
join two feet on the ground just feel
experience what it does with you just
sit very comfortable for a couple of
minutes so you focus on your breath and
you relax your body with every exhale
you really can relax everything just try
an experiment and during my cello play I
will also sing a melody from tears a a
little town in the heart of France and
today is a very spiritual place so it&#39;s
a very simple melody and it can go on
forever we don&#39;t have the time right now
but if you feel that you want to join
this beautiful melody please do so and
it was a big dream to sing actually all
along with you will be amazing to sing
with hundreds of people so if you want
feel free and if not just focus on your
breath and allow yourself to relax okay
so if possible free yourself from
everything you don&#39;t need right now sit
comfortably in your chair two feet on
the ground if you wear shoes feel free
to take them off
just feel but it&#39;s what it does with you
and then I also invite you to close your
eyes and afterwards after the music is
gone still keep them close to feel and
hear the sound of silence as well it&#39;s
very powerful so please close your eyes
and focus on your breath and with every
exhale you relax the body more and more
relax your face your jaw your tongue
your eyes your arms

so slowly deepen your breath even more
and feel the sensations in your body
know that you can always take this break
you can always take this time for
yourself by breathing two feet on the
ground relax the body and you might even
know there is no gap there&#39;s only
awareness and let&#39;s move let&#39;s turn over
let&#39;s transform from human doings
towards human beings thank you
