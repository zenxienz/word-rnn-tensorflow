hi guys
America runs on bull of a time all right
that my friends was the first TV ad ever
aired say I know cuz so engaging it&#39;s
like it&#39;s it&#39;s actually what it actually
sounds like is you know when a radio DJ
is about to introduce a song on the
radio then then again and and oh go by

wrong it&#39;s 8:35 a.m. and that time is
brought to you by Bulova because America
runs on Bulova time but you know
thankfully the advertising industry on
TV has really evolved a lot in the last
many many years this was in 1941 so it&#39;s
really been 70 years now I think the
mistake that a lot of advertisers to do
is that they think that whenever a new
media comes along like TV they think
that the rules of the existing media
which at the time was radio which can be
directly applied to whatever is new but
I think what&#39;s happened in the last 70
years is that now TV ads have become
standardized 2/32 and thankfully
advertisers have gotten a lot better and
actually on actually telling a story
within a 30-second time frame who of you
here remember this ad this McDonald&#39;s ad
everyone knows who cried during this ad
bed and then I&#39;m sure some of you crying
over this ad right so so this is this is
now what a 30-second ad looks like today
but then around five or ten years ago
this new medium came along and it was
digital video in the form of YouTube and
suddenly it changed the rules all over
again because here comes this new
platform where you have an unlimited
canvas it&#39;s not 30 seconds it&#39;s not 15
seconds anymore you have a medium that&#39;s
more personal so it&#39;s not consumed on a
big screen it&#39;s consumed on a tablet or
in a laptop or on your mobile phone it
put the power of creation in users hands
so it wasn&#39;t the TV networks anymore
that had a monopoly in terms of
creativity the normal person can&#39;t
essentially become a star by creating
their own YouTube content and lastly as
the technology evolved it also created a
lot more opportunities to interact and
so on this monster called digital video
media came along advertisers were like
what do we do with this so the question
now becomes how do we move on
from the traditional way of storytelling
into what I would call the new rules
storytelling and as with any process of
moving on whether its media or in real
life as we all know and I&#39;m sure you can
all agree the hardest part of moving on
is forgetting right so what I&#39;m gonna
tell you today as I tell you the rule
the storytelling I&#39;m gonna tell you four
things you need to forget if you want to
be successful in the digital advertising
industry so the first thing you need to
forget oopsies
it&#39;s forget your time limit so like we
said you&#39;re not stuck to a 30s or 15
second or anymore and the good news is a
lot of advertisers have started to
understand this let me okay I&#39;m sorry to
understand this and now the standard for
long-form content is usually about two
to three minutes long I&#39;m sure all of
you recognize this one this one is from
Jolla B and it&#39;s the Valentine&#39;s Day
series and it was a series of three
videos that were each about two to three
minutes long and that&#39;s really become
the standard in the industry as far as
advertising so who cried watching this
I&#39;m sure many of you but thank you I see
raised hands
you&#39;re not liars that&#39;s fantastic thank
you you have the oceans cry so but what
if what if the story I want to tell it&#39;s
not two to three minutes what if the
story I want to tell I&#39;m sorry what is
the story I want to tell whoopsies sorry
not going back we go back a slide there
you go there you go what did the story I
want to tell is six hours long six hours
so this is exactly what Virgin Airlines
did what they wanted to do was to
simulate what it was like to be in a
cheap budget airline where there&#39;s no
in-flight entertainment the food is
crappy the service is crappy and so it&#39;s
like the most treacherous most horrible
six hours of your life and to give you a
preview of what went into those six
hours of video
here is what they showed
[Music]
gee mister hey mister hey mister
peanuts you&#39;re gonna eat those peanuts
you know what I cannot get enough
history I am going to Paris to study
pigeons for a year
welcome to blogeee airlines fly airlines
from from virgin air from virgin
airlines six hours of video
now what if you so that&#39;s one extreme
now what if we went the other extreme
and my story was not six hours long but
only six seconds long and that&#39;s what
the movie that&#39;s what the movie Singh
did I&#39;m sure some of you got see the
movie Singh but what they did was before
they launched the actual trailer what
they did was that they launched five six
second trailers which were essentially
padang leaked auditions of some of the
characters in the story and I have to
tell you it was super cute
[Music]
my favorite one and one last
[Music]
these kids out there right so that&#39;s the
first rule forget your time limit
whether you&#39;re six hours or six seconds
long and be adventurous with how you
want to do your advertising the second
rule is forget one too many
now we&#39;ve now gone from broadcasting
with TV which assumes that there&#39;s maybe
a family watching from behind a TV
screen - now what&#39;s called person
casting it assumes that because you&#39;re
watching on a tablet or a mobile phone
or a laptop there&#39;s only one person
behind the screen and presumably you can
talk to this person in a very direct way
which is exactly whoopsies
which is exactly what I wish she did so
yeah which is exactly what I wish she
did for for their skippable series now
who here loves the skip ad button on
YouTube right yeah everyone raised their
hands of course we love the skip ad
button on YouTube right and what was she
did was that they made the skip ad
button part of the whole joke so here&#39;s
what they did when they advertise their
their chips
[Music]
it&#39;s ironic that the more the more he
tells you to skip the ad the more you
don&#39;t want to skip it it&#39;s like I kind
of want to see him drown right and the
other ironic thing is because of because
how dit executed you know on average
about 2 in 10 people would watch an ad
all the way through but for this ad it
was actually an average of 5 out of 10
people so more than two times more
people watch this ad even if he was
telling you to actually skip it right
and the other you know and if we take
that self-awareness to a higher level we
get to what Burger King did sober King
approach the YouTube team and asked what
are the top viral videos right now and
what they did was they took all those
videos and created 64 different ads to
go in front of these videos so here&#39;s
what they did
[Music]
[Music]
YouTube and I hate these things
this guy&#39;s just trying to watch a
graphic animal attack video but no I
have to sit through an ad stupid
incredible deal guys he&#39;s trying to
watch the screaming goat video go black
highlights watching music video Jimmy
fellas look an anchorman two trailers
those grandbabies playing the guitar but
no that is sister Annette there you go
that was Burger King so that&#39;s the
second thing to forget forget one too
many forget Broadcasting think person
casting or one two one the third thing
you need to forget is for death high
production now this K can anyone guess
sorry can we could he pause it for a bit
can anyone guess with that video before
so that video before was the channel
called kids toys right and it&#39;s a family
in Laguna with two kids and all they&#39;re
doing on their channel it&#39;s just opening
toys and playing with them right and who
can guess how many views this has who
says this has 1 million views 1 million
yeah 10 million 20 50 million who&#39;s
that&#39;s 50 million who says a hundred
million 100 million alright you&#39;re all
wrong it has 300 million views this
video of them opening toys has 300
million views and they were getting so
many views from all over the world that
even abs-cbn took notice they&#39;re like
how is it that we&#39;re investing so much
on artistas and on super high production
and this is just a family with non
professionals just opening toys in their
living room and and they&#39;re getting 300
million views and this family by the way
are in
thirty thousand dollars a week from all
the advertising they get under video so
if you want to make money open YouTube
channel that&#39;s a lesson but the good
news also here for advertisers is that
it means they don&#39;t have to spend four
big artistas or big production in order
to have a great advertising and so
that&#39;s exactly what tic tac did so tic
tac worked with a magician named Zach
king there we go this is example of
exact King video there you go
he does these very quick magic tricks
which he posts on Instagram on vine and
on YouTube no no really cool right so
what tic-tac did was like okay we know
this is what you&#39;re good at
so here&#39;s a packet of tic-tac and do
your thing with it and this is what they
produced really cool stuff from tic-tac
now the other the other and the spectrum
when it comes to you know going low
production it&#39;s the fact that you can
actually let the other people do the
work for you and that&#39;s exactly what
coke did for their campaign they asked
people how would you describe the first
sip of coke and send it to us in a video
form and when they got all the entries
all the creative director had to do was
samples like edit them together on his
Mac and they came up with a sad
[Music]
right that&#39;s Thursday need to forget
forget high production let other people
do the work for you and last one is
forget storytelling and that means that
instead of just telling people your
story you need to make them part of the
story and technology has a big part in
this this is an example from there we go
sorry here&#39;s an example from Volvo so
they had a car called the xc90 which was
not gonna be in showrooms for another
six months but what they wanted to do
was be able to let people test drive the
car
even without the car being there so what
they did what they did here was that
they shot a 360 render of the interiors
of the car and also a 360 render of the
Swedish rain forests and simulated what
it would be like to do a test drive and
all they had as tools were Google
cardboard which is like the VR tool and
the mobile phone and they came up with
an experience like this right now just
because we&#39;re talking about digital
media doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean that TV can&#39;t
be part of the party anymore and that&#39;s
what Koch did for their campaign in Hong
Kong so this is the chalk campaign from
Hong Kong which involved a mobile app
where people would actually wait for the

ad to come on at 10:00 p.m. and use and
use the app to interact with the TVC so
here&#39;s what they did in Hong Kong for
Coke
[Music]
in Hong Kong coca-cola was launching the
regional TBC and our task was to stay
true to the film whilst getting every
team in town to see it and buzz about it
how could we get this one spot to excite
them on a whole new level like this
demeaning rapid motion doctor is the
latest slang word used by Hong Kong
teams after we created an iPhone app
where teens could catch the tumbling
bottle caps from the TVC to win instant
prizes step 1 download the app step 2
wait for the TVC to air at 10 p.m. each
night step 3
chop toss swing your photon to catch
instant prizes for the screen every
chopper
instantly we need discounts mobile games
and other exclusive virtual collectible
returned an otherwise traditional TV ad
into Hong Kong&#39;s and Coca Cola&#39;s
first-ever interactive TV gaming
promotion then we also ran the ads in
cinemas and outdoor today what right and
so and the other aspect of letting
people into the story is actually
letting them know the secret right and
that&#39;s why prank advertising was such a
big thing in the last couple of years
because it&#39;s it&#39;s because you as a
viewer know something that the people in
the video don&#39;t know and my favorite
piece of prank advertising has to have
come from LG when they launched an ultra
reality TV here&#39;s what they did
[Music]
I don&#39;t a yeah
you can you know Garcia is a victim this
is a loose a little bit
see ya
we know principality know
[Music]
I gotta get close this
[Music]
[Music]
there&#39;s not a fan of that prank
so in summary here the four things need
to forget first forget your time limit
forget one too many forget high
production and the last is forget story
telling but if there&#39;s one more thing
you can afford to forget honestly okay
you can forget everything I just told
you today because the reality is the one
thing that you should never forget is
that the is the core of what a good
story is and what a good story is is a
basic human truth that is told with
insanity of intention thank you
[Applause]
you
