for years I struggled with my body I was
in constant battle with myself
externally it displayed itself in
various ways but I was always searching
for one thing I craved control for a
while I managed this desire and it
didn&#39;t fully reveal itself until I went
through a challenging experience that
left me feeling vulnerable I felt like I
had no authority over my body and as a
result I turned to food thinking it was
the only thing that I could regulate
little did I know that four months later
I would be diagnosed with anorexia and
being informed that I should be
hospitalized I&#39;m here today it&#39;s ring
light two subjects that is often
enveloped in secrecy like most other
addictions eating disorders are not
uncommon in the way they creep up
through your subconscious I thought I
was doing the right thing
exercising and eating healthy I ran
every day without fail I always took the
stairs refused to miss a workout and had
a panic attack if I did I can count the
things I allowed myself to eat on one
hand
pretty much all food was off-limits I
didn&#39;t think about my friends family the
future because all of my time was spent
calculating every macro and micro
nutrient that passed my lips as I
recalculated the calories I had consumed
within the last minute hour and day I
cried but eventually the tears just
stopped and I couldn&#39;t cry anymore
I couldn&#39;t smile anymore I was just numb
but what I did worked I lost weight when
I was 14 I was told that I needed to
gain half my body weight to be healthy
half of my body weight this was crazy
I thought I was healthy everyone else
was just jealous of me I was the one who
had it all figured out so I told the
doctors therapists and dieticians that I
would do my best to get better but
secretly I congratulated myself on my
success I will never forget that spring
afternoon that ECG the day I was told
that my heart could fail my heart rate
was so low that the doctors thought it
could stop beating I was 14 and I
thought I was going to die but a small
part of me realized that life might be
worth it it was the first step in
acknowledging that I had to say
something
recovery was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever
had to do I was ashamed terrified of
being known as that anorexic girl but
slowly I gained my life back I could
smile again laugh again and I finally
found the way out being recovered
doesn&#39;t mean that I never struggle but
it means that I&#39;ve learned how to cope
with life in other ways than depriving
myself when we feel lost or lonely we
reach the things that make us feel safe
my escape from the world may be
different to yours it may be the same
some people turn to drugs alcohol and
other addictions some internalize their
pain sometimes it&#39;s manifested on other
people
some people reach for something that
makes them feel safe someone it can even
be a person while all of these ways of
dealing with stress or pain can be okay
for a while I realize that they&#39;re only
okay until they&#39;re not at one point or
another every one of us in this room
will go through something hard we have
no control over the challenges that we
will be confronted with but we can
choose how we react to them so I thought
I would share the three things that
helped me to recover
and truthfully changed my life number
one be vulnerable talk to someone it can
be anyone you trust as long as they&#39;re
willing to listen our coping mechanisms
are all different but we tend to hide
our insecurities from the people in the
world around us but I can promise you
that by telling just one person whatever
you&#39;re going through will seem a little
bit more manageable mental illness
disease divorce divorce death sexuality
these are all things that we can shy
away from speaking about because they
make us feel uncomfortable but what if I
said that one in four people will
experience some sort of mental illness
throughout their lifetime what if I said
that 90% of girls in the average high
school have been on some kind of diet so
the next time you feel like reaching for
that thing that makes you feel safe or
you feel like not telling anyone they
hear just not okay I challenge you to
tell someone number two be your own best
friend we would never go up to someone
we love and tell them they just weren&#39;t
good enough I want my friends and family
to know that there isn&#39;t anything I
would change about them so let&#39;s do the
same thing for ourselves treat yourself
like you would treat your best friend or
the person you love the most
the day that you become okay with
yourself confident on your own is the
day you stop reaching for that crutch
that safety blanket that escape number
three know that it will get better if
you want it to
I chose recovery because I realized that
there is a difference between living and
surviving I realized that my life do not
have to be defined by numbers my
self-worth is not defined by my weight
our success is not dependent on our
academic average our value as people is
not measured by the number of likes we
get on
gran and our happiness is not reliant on
other people when I was 14 I was told
that I needed to gain half my body
weight it took two years
but it&#39;s the most rewarding thing that
I&#39;ve ever done whatever you have gone
through whatever you are going through
or whatever you will go through know
that there will be something good it
took me a long time to realize to being
anorexic doesn&#39;t need to be a secret so
if you haven&#39;t already say something
because someone is listening thank you
