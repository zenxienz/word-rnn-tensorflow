as you all know this is condoms
thigh-high sigh after this song was
released people started to ask what is
Kangnam further on the world condom was
introduced in dictionary and this port
is called tech condo also introduced in
dictionary as a Korea&#39;s traditional
sports which became an official sport in
2007 Olympics
likewise there is some Koreans were
there introduced dictionary at himself
because there is not the world that
didn&#39;t replace them keeping our own
culture and introducing to the world
that should be something that I can be
really proud of as Korean however not
all of them fill me with pride some I
will keep it inside and never bring up
to the world unfortunately Korea has
already spotted the war has spread to
the world already and today I&#39;m going to
focus on the World Cup show you might
not know the meaning yet but you
definitely recognize it literally
capitalists to over use your power on
others the meaning of capital can be
found throughout Korea&#39;s history the
people have made the relation of cup and
a base like contract or fitter link that
conjugates has made the Cox appeal to
and copy him someone who all had to pay
I couldn&#39;t have been more ashamed when
the work out she was introduced to the
world but officially UK independent
introduced the World Cup to lessen your
power
some people said the standard being
better depends on money color race or
religion and as they believe they&#39;re
superior in some way they come in
capital on someone else what can you see
there are some of the principles made in
different materials and if I ask what do
you want to have you definitely say that
you want that go spin but if the
question change into were can you afford
the answer will be different to you
might able to afford the gospel silver
spoon bronze plan or it might even be
that our spoon and this is where the
spoon tiara come from in Korea the spoon
is a symbol that represents someone&#39;s
ancestry the gospel symbol is people
whose parents are rich on the other hand
there&#39;s their spoons which symbolize
people whose parents are poor in Korea
their silica Kangnam where most rich
people live it&#39;s funny that the teachers
of private school in us already knew the
word Kangnam even before the Gangnam
style psy was released because all of
those rich smart Korean students home
address or with to Niskanen in Busan
there&#39;s anthem city as I lived there I
see most of children wearing provost
school uniform which is made of cashmere
the knowledge they&#39;ve learned in the
previous school the worms the cashmere
uniform provides these are the
privileges that only go spin can enjoy
they will never figure out how cold the
winter is or how valuable the piece of
textbook is still the winter is still
cold and the piece of textbook is still
valuable to those spoons in this spoon
society the gap between them will get
bigger and bigger the only the capital
will fill at ASCAP&#39;s
February 12 2013
Sienna reported to the world of the
story of one woman her name is Jo and
her father is the chairman of Korean air
which is the biggest air base in Korea
when she was the first class passenger
and an international flight on
attendance server notes in a bag she
won&#39;t eat them on the plate
she shouted at intendent and made her
kneel
she also demanded that the plane to go
back to the New York&#39;s Airport so the
crew member could be kicked off from the
flight because of this scream scene the
flight was delayed for 46 minutes but
nobody said anything as I knew the dark
reality the money was considered as a
power in Korea I was safe that is lucky
that the situation change afterwards she
did something very wrong
that couldn&#39;t be hidden under her
position power or wealth in Korea we
still had to believe that one day
everyone could become equal the whole
society reacted and then the aftermath
was huge
we&#39;ve been succeeded pulling her down
from her position and even though she&#39;s
only sentence one year of jail it meant
a lot for us however after the incident
there is news reports about culture
every single day and still now
whenever I turn on the news I see
another culture cases reported so what
can we do what can you do to make the
society better
well it seems obvious that the law has
to be more strict
hello Cho whom I mentioned before only
had to stay in jail for one year all
those rich people who&#39;ve committed
capital only had to pay fines the
results of all those slaps on the wrist
were more news reports and articles and
generous about capital cases to
discourage capital more strong and
strict law should be applied for those
who commit up to but we&#39;re the one who
are going to be the leaders of the
society soon rather than being anxious
about the law we need more kind of
self-reflection so we can provide an
education to prevent the capture I
believe that to learn from our history
is the best way to prevent our future
throughout history people have made the
idea that the power come from the well
almighty is a dollar this materialistic
idea have been great throughout the
history but counters repetition but I
want to enforce it we have we have been
calling this idea for too long and it&#39;s
time for us to change now we can confine
those examples our cultural history and
reflect on ourselves in order to make
this society fair trenton USA the
comforter statues are the permanent
issue in the media the confederate
statues are the monument their honor to
be mean to honor the combat leaders
soldiers or combat red states the desire
of them to preserve the institution of
slavery was the primary motivation of
cessation and the main cause of the
subsequent american civil war in 1865
after the war that after the loss of
more than 600,000 lives the Confederacy
was defeated the slavery was abolished
but still now some wives spare mice&#39;s
support the statues as they believed to
their great part of the history code
generated economy for USA so why is this
causing conflict as the Oh No
there are many different people with
many different races for sacrifice as
econ as slavery living in USA now
they&#39;re strongly demanding to remove the
statues how would you feel to look at
the statues who exploited you who
massacred yourself they&#39;re not
respecting others as I believe they&#39;re
super to black people who are sacrifice
there&#39;s no doubt that is a sin Cocteau
not only Korea we as our have already
been spotted spotted for committing up
to
Michelle Obama the former fur lady of
United States said as she very clear
strong men men who are jewelry role
models don&#39;t need to put all men down to
make themselves feel powerful the people
who are truly strong leave other up
people were truly powerful bring other
together despite the fact that she&#39;s
woman and black which might be seen as a
position without power she&#39;s considered
one of the most respected woman in the
world no matter how rich were what color
your skin is or what religion you
believe we all have a right to aim high
and move forth just like Michelle Obama
she&#39;s a role model whom we need to
emulate the process might be tall and
long but I want to give this message to
you all the quotation from my farewell
plant Dylan Thomas like an earnest
desire towards his father we should
fight against the society volocopter
then we could light this world where we
can share our dreams and tragedies rage
rage against the dying of the light
