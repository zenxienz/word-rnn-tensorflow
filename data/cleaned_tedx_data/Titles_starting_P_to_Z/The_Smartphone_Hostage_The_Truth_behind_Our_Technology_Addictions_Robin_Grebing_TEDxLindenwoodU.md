raise your hand if you think there are a
lot of bad drivers on the road yeah I
see a lot of hands maybe every single
one now raise your hand if you think
that you are a good driver mm-hmm
still see a lot of hands in the air
Allstate Insurance did a survey and they
asked people to rate their driving
skills and the driving skills of other
drivers the survey revealed that two
thirds rated themselves as excellent or
very good drivers but they rated the
other people as being poor drivers in
the same survey 89% of us admit to
driving faster than the posted speed
limit and 34% of us admit to texting or
sending email while we&#39;re driving so how
can 64% of us believe that we&#39;re
excellent or very good drivers when
we&#39;re driving too fast while we&#39;re
texting well there&#39;s psychology at work
here when we do something bad we tend to
explain it away by rationalizing it like
well I was late for work so I had to
speed up or we blame some circumstance
like that I kept swerving in my leg lane
so I had to speed up to get away from
him it&#39;s the he started it excuse when
other people do something bad it&#39;s a
character flaw that person is a bad
driver or just an idiot well I use a
different word but this is a family show
so we&#39;ll pretend that I say idiot the
universal truth in this research is that
our perceptions and reality are very
different we have trouble
honestly evaluating our own behavior and
how it might be hurting us results of
the driving study can be generalized to
other areas of our lives let&#39;s talk
about cell phones raise your hand if you
think that some people use their cell
phones at inappropriate times I&#39;m with
you on that yes the next logical
question would be
do you use your phone at inappropriate
times but I&#39;m not gonna ask that instead
we&#39;re gonna do some research of our own
today for the rest of this talk keep an
eye on the people sitting around you and
count how many times they check their
phone during this talk we&#39;re all going
to be paranoid together and I&#39;m not here
to knock cell phones cell phones have
become a necessary part of life for most
Americans right we can&#39;t put them down
not even we&#39;re out to dinner with our
friends cell phones have become an
essential technology in a very short
period of time the first cell phone call
was made by Martin Cooper
a Motorola employee in 1973 he called
Bell Labs one of Motorola&#39;s competitors
and I don&#39;t know what he said during
that phone call but it was probably
something like did you just call me I
saw I had a missed call from you the
BlackBerry was introduced in 2002 and
that kicked off the smartphone era when
Steve Jobs held up the first iPhone at
the Macworld conference in 2007 he
showed off its appealing touchscreen
interface and a revolution was born
smart phones give us access to the whole
world in one small device we can manage
email catch the hottest TV shows connect
with family and friends keep up our
calendars play games and yes even watch
cat videos on our phones today 95
percent of Americans own a cell phone
and 77 percent have a smartphone that&#39;s
up from just 35 percent in 2011
it took about 50 years for landline
phones to reach 50 percent of American
households smartphones were in the hands
of 50 percent of Americans over age 13
in less than 10 years why were we so
quick to buy a $500 phone it might be
that we&#39;re accustomed to using
technology so we&#39;re more willing to try
these new tools and gadgets it might be
that our busy lifestyles predispose us
to the convenience of smart phones or it
might be that smart
phones have been designed to lure us in
with their shiny screens and their
millions of apps we get excited about
games of candy crush and we anticipate
the next snapchat video then we&#39;re
hooked we&#39;re mainlining Angry Birds and
we just can&#39;t get enough all we can
think about is our next fix of Netflix
cellphones are designed to be addictive
and 77% of the population needs rehab we
are so dependent on our cell phones that
some hardcore users will get their fix
anywhere they can college students spend
about nine hours a day using their cell
phone that&#39;s longer than they spend
sleeping or studying most of us find
this constant attention to cellphones
irritating oh wait hold on yeah well I&#39;m
giving a TED talk right now yeah what
can I call you back okay okay yeah I&#39;ll
call you back right it&#39;s irritating the
stranger who has the phone on speaker so
we hear their whole conversation or the
person who checks their phone during the
movie and the person who is texting
while driving and they have no idea what
they&#39;re doing
we all have pet peeves for the bad
behavior that we see in others but most
of us are guilty of the same bad
behavior we can&#39;t help ourselves we are
slaves to our impulses and tech
designers are counting on that so how
are smart phones controlling us
developers are employing some serious
psychology to entice us to spend more
time on device which is the same term
that&#39;s used to describe gambling addicts
and casino games one way tech developers
manipulate us is by using intermittent
variable rewards apps are designed to
link our actions to rewards or prizes
like bonus points in a game new text
messages being tagged in a post on
Facebook and even new emails from work
stimuli
because we feel like we&#39;re getting a
reward the catch is that the reward
isn&#39;t always there it&#39;s only
intermittently given every time we check
our phone we&#39;re hoping to get the reward
something like a notification that
someone new is following us on Twitter
when rewards are given an unpredictable
schedule our rate of addiction is higher
so just like gambling addicts keep
rolling the dice we keep checking our
phones hoping for the big score tech
designers all show also exploit our need
for social approval when you receive a
notification that a friend has tagged
you in a photo on Facebook you feel
validated like a member of the in-crowd
like you belong I hate to break it to
you but your friend didn&#39;t suddenly
think of yourself esteem and tagged you
in the photo your friend responded to a
prompt from Facebook to tag the people
in the photo
in fact we feel compelled to obey these
commands the tech companies design their
programs to maximize the manipulative
potential for every action we take if
you post a new photo the app notifies
your friends and prompts them to comment
one person&#39;s comment compels someone
else to post a message to write because
we want to belong so we participate the
comments are spread across this vast
network of users to make it appear that
tons of people care about what you&#39;re
having for dinner you are notified about
every comment tag and light so you are
continually pulled back into the app
snapchat also exploits our need for
social approval the streaks feature
shows the number of days in a row that
two people have exchanged photos and
people feel real anxiety over breaking a
streak and risking disapproval the
anxiety we feel in these situations is
very real one research team found that
when people are separated from their
phones their brains produce a hormone
called cortisol which triggers the
fight-or-flight response this is the
same
hormone that&#39;s released when we sense
danger so the hormone that made us hyper
alert centuries ago so that we could
survive real danger like attacks from
wild animals today compels us to check
our phones in fact the only way we can
subdue that anxiety is to check our
phone we are being conditioned to
constantly look at our smartphones many
of us use our phone as an alarm clock
so our phone is the first thing we see
every day after that initial compulsion
to check for emails and messages that
came in overnight we check our phone
obsessively 150 times a day but we are
not making 150 conscious choices brain
scans prove that free choice when it
comes to cell phone use is just an
illusion when we play a game on our
phone our brains look the same as a
person&#39;s brain when they&#39;re abusing
drugs or the brain of a gambling addict
putting coins in a slot machine before
smart phones the average person had an
attention span of 12 seconds a recent
study found that our attention span is
about 8 seconds
goldfish can pay attention for 9 seconds
which means I wish you guys were
goldfish every time we use an app we&#39;re
submitting to this manipulation apps
track how long we&#39;re logged in what we
click on how long we spent on each
screen and every other action we take
all that data is transferred back to the
company where it&#39;s used to redesign the
apps to capitalize on our individual
behavior patterns the purpose of
increasingly personalizing our
experience is to deliver the advertising
that we are most susceptible to apps do
a better job of generating income from
advertising than any other medium
including including television it&#39;s time
that we face it the computer geniuses in
Silicon Valley are using our weaknesses
against us research has found that 90%
of Americans are overusing misusing or
abusing their
10 to 12% are addicted to their phones
50% of teenagers feel like they are
addicted to their phones
teenage girls send about 3,000 text
messages every month that&#39;s a hundred a
day have you heard of phantom cellphone
vibrations this is a real thing people
feel a vibration like they&#39;ve gotten a
text message or a phone call but it&#39;s
just in their head and the phone did not
vibrate a slight muscle twitch for the
feeling of your clothes against your
skin is interpreted as a phone vibration
this is even on Web MD com
and you know it&#39;s a problem when it&#39;s
showing up on Web MD a calm as an
educator cellphone addiction is a
concern for me and I&#39;m sharing this
information with you because I think you
should take notice and take the power
back from the tech companies that are
trying to manipulate you let&#39;s go back
to our research project raise your hand
if the person next to you looked at
their phone during this talk not very
many
that&#39;s because you knew there was
external monitoring and so you were more
aware of your behavior and therefore
more in control of it I hope that this
talk has made you more aware of the
psychology of cellphone design and that
you reconsider how you use your phone
our attachment to devices becomes a
serious problem when it keeps us from
engaging with others in the here and
then now it&#39;s a problem when we are so
attached to our cell phones that we
can&#39;t stop ourselves from checking it
and when we feel anxiety when we&#39;re
separated from it that&#39;s obsession and
it&#39;s not healthy cell phones can&#39;t show
us the world but only in words and
pictures if you&#39;re driven to distraction
150 times a day the world is passing you
by look up from that tiny screen and
experience the beautiful world that&#39;s
all around you thank you
you
