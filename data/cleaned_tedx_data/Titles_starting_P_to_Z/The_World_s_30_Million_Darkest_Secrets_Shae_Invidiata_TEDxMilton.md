good morning so I&#39;m going to speak to
you today about the world&#39;s 27 million
darkest secrets it&#39;s happening
everywhere it should be illegal
everywhere and unfortunately it&#39;s
happening somewhere in a neighborhood by
you it&#39;s the ugly dark secret of human
trafficking in layman&#39;s terms to give
you the easier version of what it is
we&#39;re going to talk about this morning
human trafficking is the illegal
movement or harboring of a person
whether it&#39;s across international
borders which we tend if you&#39;ve heard
the term before that&#39;s what we have a
tendency here in Canada to think that
it&#39;s an international coming across from
whether it&#39;s Japan Southeast Asia into
places like Canada in the United States
but human trafficking can be an illegal
movement or harboring of a person right
here in Canada can be province to
province city to city it can be
harboring somebody in their own very
home right where we are here in Milton
and in the surrounding areas what is
being done is the act of luring coercing
somebody forcing them to do something
that they wouldn&#39;t have naturally chosen
to do on their on by themselves on their
own many different tactics to keep them
doing it there and the purpose is for
the exploiters personal gain or profit
at the core of human trafficking is
slavery a more familiar term that we are
we&#39;re familiar with and have an
understanding of and although slavery is
illegal everywhere in the world it is
still unfortunately happening here today
in Canada and also abroad we think it&#39;s
abolished but it&#39;s very much alive and
well sometimes slavery is actually
looking at us right in the face and we
might not even recognize it it&#39;s
happening in our schools both public and
private schools it&#39;s happening in our
malls it&#39;s happening at our movie
theaters sometimes even at coffee shops
that you might actually
frequent and go-to it&#39;s happening with
our nannies that come here it&#39;s
happening in nail salons it&#39;s happening
in massage parlors and actually in the
photo you can see this massage parlor in

particular is open till 2:00 a.m. ask
anyone you know the last time she went

and had a massage after 7:00 p.m. at
night kind of raises a red flag and
oftentimes these massage parlors are on
sucking stories as well I have never in
my life wanted to go to a massage parlor
or to a spa that you have to go upstairs
to but we see them all over especially
in sure in Toronto there&#39;s over 3000 of
them right now it&#39;s happening on the
pages of Craigslist
kijiji backpage.com this is just a
recent ad that I just pulled up for the
purpose of our conversation here today
it&#39;s happening in our agricultural
fields not too far from where we are out
in Niagara but all the way across Canada
as well it&#39;s in the race that we eat
it&#39;s in the sugar we crave it&#39;s in the
coffee we need its end the diamonds and
the clothes that we wear it&#39;s in the
strawberries that are picked and it&#39;s
also in the peaches and in the apples
that we consume there are more people
today in slavery than ever before in
history 27 million people are in some
form of slavery right now globally if
you go online and do some research
you&#39;ll actually see that there&#39;s a broad
range for this statistic ranging from
anywhere from 20 million to about 48
million and I know that is it&#39;s a broad
range for the purpose of freedom and our
allies and within the UN and certain
different networks that we work with we
choose to use the term 27 million and
that there&#39;s over that so right now
there&#39;s over 27 million people in some
form of slavery in Canada the two most
prevalent forms are forced labor and
sexual exploitation but there are other
forms around the world things like
forced marriage which is actually a
growing growing form of trafficking that
we are seeing in Canada unfortunately
where young children are being
forced to marry adults whether they&#39;re
18 and plus 30 year olds 50 year olds
and because they&#39;re married it allows
for them to be able to do whatever they
please to this young person to the child
child labor debt bondage is another form
of slavery whether you&#39;ve been born into
some form of debt and you have to pay
off your debt before you can go and
literally you&#39;re asleep to that master
or if your father wanted took out a loan
in places like India where they take out
a loan to have to start their own farm
what they don&#39;t realize is that when
they take that loan the interest rate
isn&#39;t so enormous lehigh that in their
own lifetime they will never be able to
repay that debt small things like
education that each of us have in this
room fortunately know that when you go
to the bank to take out a loan the
interest rate if it&#39;s above 15% you
probably shouldn&#39;t do it and even that
is still very high well for people who
don&#39;t come from educated backgrounds
they go and take out a loan without
realizing the debt that is going to
incur and all of a sudden they find
themselves in a life of slavery until
that diet is paid off
another form of trafficking is organ
trafficking as well so around the world
27 million people that&#39;s a really big
number and if you&#39;re like me you don&#39;t
have 27 million sitting in the bank and
if you do please come talk to me out
there because I&#39;d love to be your friend
and if you don&#39;t have 27 million friends
again this number is intangible no
concept of it and as they shared with
you before the broad range of this
statistic for a moment I want to try to
contextualize what 27 million is for us
right now in our in our country in
Canada there&#39;s thirty six point six
million people so imagine for a moment
that our entire nation is in some form
of slavery everybody from the East Coast
everybody to the West Coast including
all of our territories an eighty percent
are women and children seventy percent
are trafficked for the purpose of sexual
exploitation which is a really fancy way
of saying to be raped 15 to 20 times
day and you can see in the photo the
gentlemen I don&#39;t know for some of the
people maybe in the back you can&#39;t read
it but he said that he paid for sex with
the child that he found that was
fourteen years old on the bottom back
page calm the average age of entry in
our in our country in Canada and even in
the United States is about thirteen
fourteen years old which means that&#39;s
the average so you guys are all very
smart people how you come up with that
average to have that number be that low
means what if does a lot that are ages
nine ten eleven and twelve years old to
have that number be that low the average
age of rescue in Canada is just 17 years
old so again when we think of the
industry of the sex trade or
prostitution we have a misconception
that we think prostitute equals choice
and right here this morning what you&#39;re
hearing what you&#39;re learning is that
these are kids these are children for me
I will argue to my death that that is
never a choice no child wakes up in
cheese&#39;s to be in a life of exploitation
sexual abuse and so part of this morning
of what I want to share with you is how
you apply choice to a situation for a
lot of these girls that are entering in
and also boys as well but it&#39;s
predominantly still females that it&#39;s a
lack thereof it&#39;s not a choice but a
lack thereof that brought them into this
situation whether they&#39;re being sexually
abused at home from a very young age age
three four five six and all the way up
whether it&#39;s by a friend a family a
family member a father an uncle a
brother or they just might be really
hungry at home and there is no food or
parents are working two jobs and they&#39;re
being neglected and therefore they leave
what&#39;s supposed to be a safety Haven and
they go out to the streets to try to
find something else or to have the abuse
stopped for me that&#39;s not that&#39;s not a
choice that&#39;s lack thereof and how we
apply that situation
it&#39;s a thirty two billion dollar
industry which is greater than the
profits of Nike and Starbucks combined
years ago when I gave this talk I used
to be able to throw in Google there but
now Google is pretty comparative on
their profits every year now and I share
that with you because again if you don&#39;t
have 27 million you don&#39;t have 32
billion it&#39;s hard to understand what
that number means and the weight of that
number this is a massive massive illegal
enterprise it&#39;s the fastest-growing
crime on our planet today and we&#39;re
talking about billions of dollars we all
know the power of Google we know the
power of things like Amazon and how they
influence and how they control us and
this is a huge industry that we&#39;re
talking about this morning
one girl in Canada can make a pimp a
trafficker and exploiter anywhere from
250,000 to 300,000 dollars a year cash
so and that&#39;s one imagine if you have
five imagine if you have ten it&#39;s what
makes this such a lucrative business and
like I said it&#39;s the fastest-growing
crime on our planet today it is the
largest illegal enterprise next to arms
and drugs the main difference is the
violent drug dealer or I&#39;m selling arms
I have a limited amount of products and
when I sell that product it&#39;s gone if I
want to sell that product again I have
to get more product to sell you the
product well if you&#39;re a human
trafficker if I have people I can just
rent out my product and I don&#39;t have to
go and get more product so human
trafficking is very lucrative from that
standpoint because the body can be
reused over and over and over again so
it begs the question here in Canada who
is this happening to who is doing it and
also why outside of the obvious of what
I just shared with you of how lucrative
the industry is poverty and
vulnerability are the two driving forces
behind human trafficking sometimes it&#39;s
just poverty other times it&#39;s just
vulnerability and
sometimes they both meet in the middle
and you&#39;ll see scenarios where that
happens places overseas like in Kenya or
in India of poverty and vulnerability go
hand in hand in Canada we have the same
thing but sometimes they&#39;re independent
you&#39;ll see for us our most marginalized
communities which are aboriginals and
First Nations people time and time again
and some of you in the room I hope have
heard about the missing 500 women and
that&#39;s such a small number it&#39;s way
bigger than that because of the lack of
education so much abuse that goes on in
the Aboriginal communities up in the
north and in the different reserves
around in the provinces that at the any
opportunity that they get to escape the
abuse to have go down in the city where
they think they&#39;re gonna get a good job
or an education they meet somebody that
says you know I can give you work or if
you come down here and do this for me
I&#39;ll provide you with that our runaway
youth again like I showed with you
before kids who are leaving their homes
and going to the street Street kids kids
in the foster system orphans as well are
very prone to this but it&#39;s also
happening like I showed with you earlier
in our schools in public and in private
schools so this is in a scenario where
it&#39;s just coming from a broken family or
about an abusive family kids that are
from good loving families that are
taught right from wrong that have good
education and know better this is
happening to every time I speak in high
school I got one student coming up to me
after saying I think this is happening
to my friend right now and so many kids
are going home and laying their heads on
their beds with their parents there and
they are being sexually exploited day in
and day out the difference with there is
the more of a tactic of a wooing tactic
that these pimps and traffickers use
where it&#39;s a male usually between the
ages of 18 to 25 sometimes a bit older
than that that will prey upon the 13 14
15 16 year-olds and come off as if they
are going to be a boyfriend figure they
Lou them for a bit they dine them not
whine them cuz you know there&#39;s still a
big
you&#39;re but they bring them to the
parties or they&#39;ll do the shopping and
take them for dinners and tell them how
beautiful they are they sell them on the
dream and they get them to a point where
they&#39;re so conditioned but they will end
up doing whatever their boyfriend asks
them to do and it&#39;s usually not at the
beginning of course that the abuse
starts when you first meet your
boyfriend you kind of like them you&#39;re
supposed to like them you&#39;re not gonna
be afraid of him
so the tactics of keeping them there and
it&#39;s a much longer story which
unfortunately don&#39;t have time to share
with you today of how they do you got
but they will switch the switch comes on
and they enter into an entire life of
abuse and exploitation that they never
thought was gonna happen so who is doing
this your typical like if I were to ask
you guys some of you I&#39;m sure would say
organized crime yes our street gangs and
then bigger games as well but it&#39;s also
happening by ordinary people that we
just would not imagine I&#39;m not sure how
many of you are from the Halton area but
just even last year things about a year
year and a half ago two Realtors were
arrested for trafficking in Halton or
certain while that is true in Oakville
and in Milton and you would never have
thought and I&#39;m actually a realtor by
profession and so for me hearing that in
the industry it was heartbreaking but
you go I quite like a realtor is doing
this like so it&#39;s people that you don&#39;t
expect
just even last week in Peterborough the
police arrested and a 22 year old and an
18 year old couple boyfriend and
girlfriend who were trafficking a
teenager they created an ad that they
posted online probably back page calm
that was a sec side and they pimped her
out they were exploiting her out for
money so it&#39;s happening by people that
we don&#39;t expect
and then why it&#39;s basic economics
wherever you have a demand there&#39;s gonna
be a supply for something and
unfortunately in our world and also in
Canada there is a great demand to have
access to female bodies and also growing
attention to male bodies to purchase sex
and again this
an enterprise it&#39;s an illegal enterprise
but is happening by every race to every
race
nobody is removed from it and so you
also have the same thing in professions
this is happening by taxicab drivers by
your business men by Bay Street traders
by lawyers by doctors by politicians by
tradesmen by students by couples and
it&#39;s it&#39;s heartbreaking because you just
wouldn&#39;t think especially in today&#39;s day
and age we know better we should know
better
we&#39;re in that technology era where you
have no reason to not know what is
actually going on right now in Canada I
naturally sorted before I share that
with you to give you a prime example on
Monday I got a Facebook message at 6

a.m. or 5:30 a.m. about a girl who was
on a streetcar in Toronto and literally
did a citizen arrest with her cell phone
she videotaped this 50-plus year old man
use a white male who she caught speaking
to a 15 year old on the phone and he was
trying to lure her and convince her to
come and meet him using phrases like I&#39;m
a professional I&#39;ve done this before I
promise nothing bad will happen to you
and because she knew a little bit and
I&#39;m hoping you guys are gonna leave here
today knowing a little bit that she took
the little knowledge that she had on
human trafficking and she said this man
is trying to meet up with this girl to
purchase her for sex and I saw the video
and I&#39;m telling you he&#39;s probably like
55 middle-aged male and she held him on
the streetcar she put up her hand she
was like you&#39;re not going anywhere you
sit down we&#39;re calling the police and I
just thought like one I need her to come
up here with me
so I&#39;m try to recruit her the friends on
Facebook now but unbelievable and this
was just my Monday like I if I had more
time to tell you stories and stories and
stories of how people we would not think
of and how this is
being done by just ordinary people and
just one six story for you that I have
to share so right now in our country
there&#39;s over 45,000 missing persons and
children I was reported by stat scan in
2016 and knowing when I know now on the
issue of human trafficking myself
personally this isn&#39;t a fact this is
just my opinion I am convinced that if
they have not found the body yet that
human trafficking has scooped them up
and they are probably in some form of
exploitation we have seen often times
where there are missing persons in
Canada and then they will end up being
found in places like strip clubs or
motels down in Minnesota and across our
borders in the United States or in just
even here in Canada - as possible so in
other places it&#39;s happening as you guys
drive home today just take a look along
the 401 take a look along the QEW
there&#39;s the motel 6 there&#39;s the
Travelodge there&#39;s a Holiday Inn to tell
you so many stories of what Halton
Police is doing just here along along
the highways with human trafficking and
rescuing girls but I share that stuff
with you because if it was your daughter
if it was your son what would you do and
how far would you be willing to go
because each girl and each boy is
somebody&#39;s daughter and is somebody&#39;s
son possibly so many sister somebody&#39;s
brother and for me we all have a part
where we can do something each of us you
don&#39;t need to do a TED talk don&#39;t worry
you don&#39;t need to start an organization
you don&#39;t need to run a campaign you
don&#39;t have to do big things today is a
great first step because you&#39;re becoming
aware if you walked in here not knowing
what human trafficking is you got a view
here today maybe unfortunately knowing
because now that you know you should do
something about it but education is our
greatest weapon and knowing a little bit
can actually change somebody&#39;s life so
become more educated on it go onto our
website if you&#39;d like it&#39;s just freedom
dot CA and you can do research on there
of what to look for how to identify
situations of human trafficking
ladies getting their nails done in
different salons and Vietnamese salons
there&#39;s more of a tendency for that if
you go down to Chinatown knowing small
things of what to look for and then if
you see something say something it may
be nothing and hopefully it&#39;s nothing
but you might just in the end save the
life and for us that is that is what we
do but with our organization with
freedom part of our mandate is to rescue
and save that one as I shared with you
earlier it&#39;s there&#39;s over 27 million
people in slavery it&#39;s such a massive
overwhelming undertaking to think you
hope that you can stop it will we ever
stop it probably not in our lifetime
will it always happen yes but like
Edmund Burke says all that it takes for
evil to triumph is for good men and
women to do nothing and so at least with
us with my team we have taken a stand to
say as long as we have a voice we&#39;ll be
a voice for those who have been silenced
we will go down in history as people
that actually stood up to do something
it doesn&#39;t have to be massive but to do
something and even if we can&#39;t save them
all we can save one and that&#39;s where you
make the biggest difference and in
closing I just want to share a story
with you that is my favorite and usually
I cry at the end so I&#39;m really gonna
hold on to this today it&#39;s one of my
favorite story is about a man who&#39;s
walking down on the beach and this is as
you can see in the photo and all of the
starfish thousands and thousands of
starfish have been washed up on shore
and it&#39;s sunny oh and the sun&#39;s beating
down and of course because the starfish
are not in water they&#39;re dying and off
in the distance there&#39;s a young boy
that&#39;s bending down one by one and
throwing the starfish back in the water
and the man walking down the beach sees
this and he&#39;s puzzled he goes up to the
boy and he says son what are you doing
said you can&#39;t possibly save them all
and therefore you can&#39;t possibly make a
difference what&#39;s the point
and smirking the young boy looks up
man and he bends down and he picks up
one more starfish and he says it made
