hi I&#39;m Amina hi hello can I get a
response hi
great hi hi whoo okay yeah I&#39;m gonna do
a poem I&#39;m really really excited I have
a big family
they&#39;re over all this siblings 17 of us
and I&#39;m the last one so I think all of
the things like the issues and like
stories that we deal with I have a very
unique perspective about that so I&#39;m
going to share this poem for you I hope
you enjoy it one birth I was not born
under a rhyming planet I was born a
conclusion to her motherhood premature
spitting fire from belly shattering
uterus taking her womb out into the
world with me I was born dirt underneath
fingernail scraped me away take me away
I was never meant for this world I was
not a blessing just a mistake father
took it from her this time didn&#39;t bother
asking when I was born the moon did not
descend no sheeps were slaughtered
raising me was sacrifice enough before
the cord was cut they argued on what to
call me he wanted a name by could have
run away from she wanted a 3-dimensional
one now nothing brings her joy she opens
her mouth to laugh I presume and her
body falls out when my name is said out
loud it reminds her of missed
opportunities and revolving doors and no
escape she vowed I am the last of her
tribe she called her mother over the
rocky signal and explained that I was
not a miracle just said I was born to
child I learned that a young age to
apologize for taking up space my old
family home hold secrets in the
floorboards the new residents don&#39;t know
that they laywer dad used to keep his
belt but the bathroom sink was always
blocked by bulimia the kitchen tiles
were originally white not red
the landline was cut but still wrong
there were broken promises in the bread
bin the staircase was made out of bones
and a chalk outline of a bird&#39;s body on
the living room floor can they not smell
the decay the rotting they called us
trouble children but I think we were
more scared thought the monster
underneath our bed looked a lot like our
father the neighbours children used to
thread chicken wings and our front lawn
and we questioned our existence that
night I felt uncomfortable by the sound
of doors closing only a wall was
separating me from a murderer when I
awake the house is full and I think
about the women in my life they must
find something in forgiving men they do
it so often three love we danced for
what seems like all of life our bodies
moving more one than enough swans in a
lake I laugh into my pillow you said my
love made you want to believe in God I&#39;d
never felt happiness corroding my
insides until now with you my organs
melt together and find their way up my
throat where it tastes gray like the
aged love bite on your neck when we take
a trip to the beach keep us away from
the sea I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll drown our time
together lovers of Genesis and
revolution maybe love is light drama
like Friday prayer LexA chewed for death
often I spend my nights swimming in
coffins planning memorials because the
world so easily forgets
now I lie alone in dark rooms the spleen
I&#39;ve ripped out from behind him sitting
in my hands if you listen real close you
can hear death climbing into bed with my
pain and asking her about her day when I
tie my hair back away from my neck
because as if it all disappears all the
kissing and choking why is it no one
believes a girl until he causes her
death my mother still harbors her lost
children in her lungs sometimes I think
God must feel guilty that I am still
here
when I rock a rap when I walk around in
her clothes I see her face everywhere I
crane my neck to follow her dinosaur
down a side road my body stays put
cracking my vertebraes my head continues
floating down the road
I think the Angel of Death might be
coming but it&#39;s way too early to tell
thank you so much
