hello everyone so in public speaking
they always say there are three things
that you should always you know aim at
so you should have brevity Liberty and
repetition so let me see that again
so brevity levity thank you very much
and repetition so well with that in mind
let me first kick this start kick kick
this off by saying well what is a
catalyst so I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all very
intelligent and well-educated people
here and so we will automatically know
that catalyst it has its roots from the
archaic word catalysis which is in turn
from the latinized Greek word kata and
lean referring to the process of
breaking down something okay so a
catalyst is something that remains
unchanged but which can bring about
change in others okay so the question we
should be asking when we are thinking
about catalysts is well how do we bring
about change how do we motivate this
action so well I think we should take
from this is that we are looking for the
ability to invent to find more meaning
in things perhaps by breaking down
things and so to see things in new ways
so seeing things differently perhaps
that&#39;s how we find catalysts so again
let me say that in a different way you
will know about the famous allegory of
the cave which Plato Post posited as a
thought experiment imagine there is a
cave and then in that cave there are a
bunch of prisoners who were chained
there from birth and then to them the
whole life all they see are shadows
reflected on the wall okay so to them
because they grew up not knowing
anything else to then that&#39;s the entire
world that&#39;s reality that is life and
actually if you force them to look at
the fire oh you know that is the source
of the reflections they would find it
too painful too difficult they would
find
with reality too painful they would
reject it so what we need to do in the
process of finding enlightenment and
then seeing the world differently what
we need is something to pull the
prisoners out we&#39;ll see on the right so
we pull them out force them to look at
the real world and then if we do things
right the prisoner who is now out who
now see things very differently from the
way they did before and in fact this new
way of seeing will be so different that
if they were to go back to the cave and
talk to the other prisoners the other
prisoners will think oh my god what&#39;s
wrong with this person right you know
going on about these things called fire
and outside and light and so and they
would not understand what&#39;s going on you
will completely change the way you look
at the world okay so that is something
to bear in mind and you know this is not
a very terribly impressive idea you know
once you get it basically you know okay
you learn more and then you see things
differently tada
right but herein lies the problem for
those people who are imprisoned over
there it is actually very very difficult
to break them out of that that way of
thinking so in cognitive psychology this
is called the dunning-kruger effect
meaning if you are you know suffering
from some sort of mistaken belief that
lack of awareness will prevent you from
recognizing that you lack awareness
right so if you don&#39;t know what you
don&#39;t know then how can you learn about
it so well the objective that I would
like to convince you of today is that
catalyst it&#39;s all about recognizing that
this objective world that we are in it
doesn&#39;t change like you know it&#39;s just
what it is this is the real life but
what needs to change is our way of
looking at things
so catalyst is controlled by our way of
seeing the way of seeing things
differently that is what I believe
catalyst is so well I mean why am I the
one to talk about this so I am one of
the cofounders of
theater company called a shadow players
so we were a bunch of you know rather
foolhardy people who started doing
theater in university and then realized
that a point graduation that oh my god
after graduation we&#39;ll have to stop
doing this since that&#39;s like unbearable
terrible so we decided to just well
start doing it ourselves and then what
we would like to achieve is to make
Western literature approachable to a
local audience because we love
literature in theater so much we would
like to help people look at classical
literature the way we do to help people
recognize that oh come on this is so
great why won&#39;t you like it it&#39;s so
obviously awesome
right so and as you do theater you think
differently because as as an actor as a
producer as an audience you look at the
script and you say I mean there is a
simple enough statement but who is
saying it it changes the meaning I mean
what is the background that made someone
say it that changes the meaning I mean
why is he or she&#39;s saying something that
changes the meaning for example in The
Importance of Being Earnest a very
famous comedy bears go out
elgyn on the character says the only way
to behave to a woman is to make love to
her if she&#39;s pretty or to someone else
if she is playing and then people look
at this is oh my god this terrible Oscar
Wow such a misogynist I hate this person
but actually he put this in the mouth of
a playboy who is someone that we are not
supposed to sympathize with right so
when we look at a script as an actor as
a you know an interesting and light and
allow me to say a member of the audience
we look at the bias we look at the
context and we look at the motives right
another example that people always quote
is in Shakespeare they say ah neither a
lender or nor borrower b-but because I
don&#39;t borrow money and Shakespeare said
so but who did he make say that it was
Polonius and Ageing in a slightly mad
person who we are not supposed to take
seriously so I believe the theatre
forces us to think about these things
constant
and so if you see someone who is you
know not someone that we are supposed to
- a something oh then you recognize you
see the same statement very differently
so let me develop upon this a little bit
so another thing that theater does is it
presents the world in a different frame
and this process of reframing is very
important because as we look at things
differently which is what theatre does
we can gain very interesting insights so
there was this Israeli psychologist
called George Cameron who did this
survey so what he did was he found a
thousand children aged 8 to 14 and he
showed them two stories basically the
same story except he changed some names
around okay so this is the first version
so this is a story from the Bible and
say Joshua found this advice and then
they utterly destroyed all that was in
the city destroyed all the men and women
young and old and so on and then he
asked the students well do you approve
of what Joshua did and the student said
six hundred out of a thousand said total
approval it&#39;s fine kill all of them it
is right and then two hundred others had
mixed feelings and then another two
hundred expressed disapproval this is
version two so essentially the same
thing but he moved it to an ancient
Chinese Kingdom led by General Lin no
relation so general Lin and his soldiers
took the towns and utterly destroyed all
that was there in men and women young
old ox sheep as with the edge of the
sword essentially the same thing well
what happened next
this time seven hundred and fifty
students expressed Toto dis approval and
then only seventy versus six hundred
totally approved of the action and the
and the rest had mixed feelings about it
so we see that by changing the frame by
changing the context we come to very
different conclusions okay so well why
is this
important right so we live in an age of
so-called post truth the word of the
year last year or aka tess lying right
so we live in this world where people
choose to sensationalized over sticking
to facts and research so there is a
greater need than ever to look at things
with sharper eyes taking a broader view
but how do we teach and practice it
right because it&#39;s very difficult you
can&#39;t just thrust people into looking at
world politics right it&#39;s too
complicated it&#39;s a recipe for disaster
people will shout at each other okay so
what we do is to wrap it in
entertainment okay because by putting
things in a different way you help
people to see things differently so
perhaps there is a chance of bringing
about change so this is an example so
the European Union has a scent of a
global affairs and they&#39;ve commissioned
us to put on a revival of our earlier
play the learned ladies based on
moli√®re&#39;s la femme savants and so this
is a story about a fraud someone I&#39;m not
very good poet who charms a bunch of
rich rich tight Eyez and then makes them
believe oh like he is amazing and then
so that they would grant him the
marriage of his daughter okay and that I
he&#39;ll gain wealth and power with it but
then ultimately of course he gets found
out and then he&#39;s banished people know
better we first put this on several
years back during the race for the chief
executive and then we chose to name the
character cy tang so and then you see
and then it got people think it wait you
know how dare you say that I mean is it
a fair thing to say why did you say that
I mean it does everything fit and then
it inspired some discussion and it got
people thinking about it from the very
different direction it was light-hearted
because hey it&#39;s just a play right and
then so people could talk about things
so I&#39;m not saying that theatre is unique
in being able to force people to think
about this and that but I am saying that
we know from experience that
having stories and characters really
inspire passion it is much more
effective way of getting people to care
about things than an essay our teachers
will know if you start talking you know

teaching anything at 9:00 a.m.

students are sleepy at 11:00 12:00 they
are hungry after lunch they are sleepy
again and then a few hours after they
are thinking about what&#39;s going on after
school so but put them in front of a
play and then you get people engaged so
in all what am I talking about
so I am urging all of you to participate
in the process of just go watch a show
buy some tickets help us out so because
what is theater theater is first of all
it is protection ok
satire and illusions is a very important
part of the freedom of expression so for
example in Animal Farm I mean what do
you mean I&#39;m talking about communist and
Stalin and so on it&#39;s just a pig you
realize it&#39;s just some pigs on a farm
doing this in that so theater allows the
creative expression while being
protected in publishing this is called
the small penis rule in that if you want
to write something about someone you add
in a little comment oh by the way this
guy has a small penis so that the guy no
one is going to come forth is it hey
that guy you said bad things about
that&#39;s me with a small penis and so on
so well satire protection it&#39;s very
important part of the freedom of
expression and theater is also about
critical practice right if you teach
someone to swim you are not going to
throw them in the ocean immediately
people need practice so when we are
thinking about thinking critical
practice I mean wouldn&#39;t it be nice if
there were materials settings like you
know a script that is clearly cleverly
written down and you know comes with
guides discussion questions and then
it&#39;s acted out by pretty people and it&#39;s
filmed in hyper to definition on a DVD
hey we have that it&#39;s called theatre
right so theatre offers us a kind of
safe space if you want to think of it
that way too allows us to which allows
us to really look at thing
differently and to discuss things in a
safe space so finally I also think this
is perhaps a little bit self-serving but
watching theater is also a kind of
social duty why do I say that I believe
that theater if you do it right it&#39;s all
about questioning every time you watch a
show and then you come up and you say
okay did you like it why did you not
like it why and then that is in essence
critical thinking if you want democracy
we can&#39;t be satisfied with low quality
discourse right we need to get people
used to always questioning why did that
happen who was saying it what made him
or her say it but hey why not do it
through theater right so theater is
basically the practice and participation
of thinking and so perhaps it is the
thing that would drag you out and then
make you see things differently so I
want to wrap this up by using this very
simple demonstration that I sometimes
use in class about the importance of
context so this is a picture taken by
the National Geographic about a polar
bear pushing on an ice-breaking vessel
so I mean what is this bear doing is
this a commentary on the sad fact of
human cost global warming is it a very
playful bear trying to find people to
you know play with is it an evil bear
trying to eat us I mean what is
happening so each time you look at it
you think about the context and then the
entire story changes so the act of
filling in those blanks the act of
seeing things differently I believe
that&#39;s the essence of theater and
education and I believe hey if you you
know think this sounds like a good idea
go out and buy a ticket watch a show so
thank you very much
[Applause]
