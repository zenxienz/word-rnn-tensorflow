racist bigots terrorists thug we as
human beings love labels the idea of us
versus them the african-americans the
Mexicans the Asians the gays transgender
Christians Muslims oh the Millennials
the root of all problems the entitled
group of hipsters why why do we love to
label the other day I was putting away
my daughter&#39;s quotes and despite what my
husband would like to say I&#39;d like to
keep everything orderly I ran across
this one dress it bothered me so much I
like to put away her clothes fancy
school clothes under her play clothes a
little bit OCD but that&#39;s all right this
one dress was fancy enough if warm with
leggings would be good for a party
casual enough worn with jeans good for
school good for play comfortable enough
to be worn as pajamas now which drawer
do I put this dress in or do I hang it
now see this piece of cloth she&#39;ll
outgrow it and I don&#39;t have to be
bothered by it but just like that piece
of cloth every single individual is
unique and cannot be put into these
perfect little boxes and drawers put
under one label but we want to so badly
because everyone doesn&#39;t fit into it and
we don&#39;t want to make the effort to
truly understand the complexity beside
we heard this one individual now I want
you to take a look at this image a study
done by Robert Goldstone he studied the
effects of categorization on color
perception what he found is when
individuals who were shown a random
series of numbers and letters arranging
from red to violet they rated the led
being similar color and the number is
being somewhat cover even though
interestingly L and eight are the exact
same color what does this have to do
with labels and Prejudice our mind
thinks that I am more like the people in
my little box in my category rather than
somebody from another box or another
category from another race religion
country political affiliation
Gordon Albert in his classic book the
nature of prejudice wrote that the human
mind must think with the aid of
categories
once these categories are formed this is
the basis for normal prejudgment we
cannot possibly avoid this process
orderly living depends on it and the
professor&#39;s scalp last wrote social
categories form an essential part of
human thought but because these
attributes such as race sex they lie on
a continuum rather than categories
social labels are never more than
approximation now what does that mean
it means the world is not black and
white there&#39;s a lot of gray in between
that we need to acknowledge in order to
know one another for example what race
are you you think you know you should do
an ancestor test we&#39;re all a mixture of
various races let&#39;s try another example
what does it mean when I say I am an
American that you were born on us well
you live the majority of your life here
that you are of a particular skin color
or belong to a social class maybe a
particular political affiliation faith
lifestyle or is being American simply
the concept of one nation under God
indivisible with liberty and justice for
all
now I want you to focus on two words in
the center
indivisible and all so how can we have
liberty and justice for all
by being indivisible how can we be
indivisible by shattering our
preconceptions one for all all for one
by starting to acknowledge that we as a
human race are more alike than we are
different alike in our desire to be free
to live our lives according to what we
believe is true happiness without being
imposed on by others so if we don&#39;t want
to be imposed on by others then what
rights do we have to impose ourselves
upon others see it is our prejudgment it
is our prejudice that forces us to
impose ourselves on others that somehow
my lifestyle my way of living is better
and the right way so everyone else must
follow me we all have prejudice some
good some bad I mean it&#39;s perfectly all
right to believe agents are smart it&#39;s
true we are
however stereotyping and Prejudice have
harmful is a harmful behavior Theodor
Adorno a man who fled Nazi Germany he
co-authored a book called the
authoritarian personality in it he
outlined the traits that led to becoming
prejudice a rigid categorical thinker
that obeyed Authority without question
that saw the world is black and white
and believed in a racial or social
superiority
let&#39;s visit this black and white world
for a second so if you voted for Trump
you must be a racist and a bigot if
you&#39;re an African American protesting
you must be a thug if you are a Muslim
hijab&#39; you might that either oppressed
or are terrorist pack one
if you&#39;re a mexican-american you must be
a legal immigrant if you&#39;re poor you&#39;re
just lazy and you want to take advantage
of the system
these are precursor conceptions that we
need to share and to learn that each
human being is unique and does not fit
into tiny little boxes the moment we see
race sex religion age as a continuum we
realize that social labels are nothing
more than bad approximation and then we
free our minds of this prejudice
do I have prejudice oh absolutely but
what am I going to do about it I&#39;m gonna
fight it I&#39;m gonna fight it every single
day we all carry the burden of prejudice
inside of us whether that prejudice is
about immigrants about a different
social class race faith lifestyle
Republicans Democrats the prejudice is
there but a simple conversation can help
us overcome this prejudice that we hold
inside of us so let&#39;s visit a world
that&#39;s not black and white
let&#39;s choose to see life as a continuum
and not rigid categories I choose to
believe that 62 million people my
neighbors my colleagues cannot be racist
I choose to believe that person standing
up for social justice is not a thug I
choose to believe that she freely
chooses to wear that as an expression of
her faith that illegal immigrants I&#39;m
sorry the illegal immigrants are
hardworking individuals looking for a
better future for their children and
illegal immigrants are running from
unimaginable circumstances that poor
people are stuck in an unfortunate
situation and they&#39;re trying their best
to get out of it so let&#39;s find things
that connect us and not that divide us a
change in your attitude and a simple
conversation can shatter all of these
prejudiced beliefs once we overcome our
preconceptions we will be
divisible and we will be enabled to
fight for justice and liberty for all I
don&#39;t want you to simply walk out of
here with this rosy idea of kumbaya
let&#39;s hold hands and sing together no
when you walk out there into that Lobby
I want you to approach someone that you
may have or had or still have prejudices
about and I want you to talk to them be
bold and ask them questions that will
help you overcome your prejudice and who
knows perhaps in doing so you may help
them overcome a prejudice about you
prejudice is a learned behavior so we
need to take steps to unlearn this
behavior now stop and think can a non-us
born brown hijab wearing women be
considered an American well if America
is an idea of justice and liberty for
all then absolutely
so let&#39;s rise above our prejudice and
fight for justice and liberty for all
because if you risk the liberty and
justice of one person you have risked it
for everyone thank you
you
