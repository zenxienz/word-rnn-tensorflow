hi my name is Amanda Southworth I&#39;m 15
years old I&#39;m a junior in high school
and I&#39;m ill as you can see I&#39;m not
physically ill I can walk talk breathin
even dance but not very well
I&#39;m not ill on the outside I&#39;m ill on
the inside and I don&#39;t have a tumor
internal bleeding cancer or anything
like that but what I have is one of the
biggest killers in the world today I
have mental illness more specifically I
have depression anxiety and
post-traumatic stress disorder what this
means for me is that mentally I&#39;m
somewhat of a hot mess it starts with
depression which makes it hard for me to
feel not just happy emotions but sad
ones too for me depression is
nothingness it&#39;s kind of like a void it
sucks away everything good or bad I
don&#39;t eat I don&#39;t sleep and I don&#39;t work
I tend to just drop off the face of the
earth but sometimes feeling nothing is
better than feeling every emotion at
once which is what my anxiety does to me
my experience with anxiety is like
having a close friend but this friend is
hurt and afraid of everything and you
can understand it yet it feels like you
can&#39;t do anything to stop it my anxiety
is my friend who&#39;s scared of getting
hurt but my post-traumatic stress
disorder makes it feel like everything
is out to hurt me
for me as long as I can remember it&#39;s
always been like this I had my first
therapy appointment over six years ago
soon I will have been mentally ill for
over half of my life nobody really knows
where it started but in between
elementary and middle school I move to
new town I knew no one and as I arrived
from the first day that was pretty
obvious
everyone had friends and I felt like an
outsider I didn&#39;t fit in and I was
sometimes bullied as middle school
progressed
I turned my destructive behavior inwards
I convinced myself that if I am of no
worth to others then I have no worth
myself over the course of 2012 to 2016
I&#39;ve attempted suicide at least
seven times the exact numbers unknown as
I would take pills wake up and forget
all about the previous night I would
walk around and think my friend how will
we go I would plan what items would be
distributed to my friends and how it was
gonna be thought of by people who didn&#39;t
know me I would go to school with the
only thought getting me through of the
day being my upcoming suicide attempt I
would wake up and cry for hours because
I didn&#39;t die in my sleep
growing up I was kind of always seen as
the past a brat I didn&#39;t see myself as a
person I saw myself as the amount of
money my parents would have to spend on
me or the annoyance in someone&#39;s face
when I asked a stupid question to me I
wasn&#39;t a person I was just a burden but
what were probably the worst years of my
life led me to the best current years in
the sixth grade I was invited to compete
with a Robotics Club I fell in love with
engineering building programming and
just anything to do with technology all
throughout middle school in high school
I would spend hours upon hours just
building websites apps coding designing
anything I could get my hands on
I loved programming because for the
first time I wasn&#39;t being destructive I
was being creative my projects had value
and I finally had worth in September of
2015 I launched my first app which gives
people resources and tools to cope with
anxiety depression and panic attacks in
May of 2017 I launched my second app
which acts as a security system for the
lgbtq+ community I didn&#39;t expect this
but my apps gave me a purpose and a
reason to stick around because of this
for more than halfway through 2017 and I
haven&#39;t self-harmed or attempted suicide
once this year
that&#39;s pretty cool because I haven&#39;t
been able to say that for the past five
years so as a result I&#39;ve devoted my
time to helping others who&#39;ve been in my
position as a result I get a lot of
messages and I&#39;ve heard a lot of stories
what these stories have shown me was
that mental illness affects everyone
even if you yourself are not directly
mentally ill there may be someone in
your life who is affected and in turn
it&#39;s affecting you considering how big
of a problem this is we as a society
don&#39;t pay enough attention to it I mean
it&#39;s happening all around us yet we
typically don&#39;t notice it we tend to
assume that if you can function and get
through the day that you&#39;re okay but
that&#39;s not the case according to
dosomething.org someone in the u.s.
attempt suicide every 16 minutes by the
time I finished speaking at least one
person will have taken their own life it
can occur within the people we know and
even within the people we least expect
it from for example take chester
bennington the lead singer of linkin
park one of the bands that helped me in
millions of other people during dark
times he recently committed suicide the
truth is we can&#39;t control mental illness
or suicide we can only control how we
support and treat the people who have it
but that can mean the difference between
life and death I didn&#39;t even know this
and tell him that someone named Victor
one night upon going through social
media
I discovered a boy posting about wanting
to end his life I messaged him and as he
replied I began to do something called
grounding which is a technique used to
distract someone if they&#39;re feeling
highly emotional I asked him questions
about what he enjoys and I soon realized
that we had a lot in common
we had a love of many of the same shows
the same bands and the same people we
soon developed a strong friendship in
which we supported each other constantly
a couple of months after our initial
meeting Victor confessed to me that I
saved his life that night meeting Victor
gave me the clarity to see that support
can mean everything
it even showed me that things that were
small and boring within my own life were
my reasons to stay alive I mean if I
wasn&#39;t going to cuddle with my cat who
Yeah right yeah who would water my
plants if I was gone or continued my
apps sure other people may take over
those duties but nobody could replace me
seeing support of all kinds have shown
me support can be the difference between
ending your life are finally gaining the
courage to reach out and change it
besides purpose my apps have given me
the opportunity to meet people from all
walks of life I&#39;ve met people who&#39;ve
been through things that I can&#39;t even
begin to comprehend I&#39;ve seen the
differences within people yet I also see
the similarities and at the end of the
day all those things we go through may
differ
we all have battles to fight we all want
someone to support and care for us
everything in my life has shown me that
both good and bad things in this world
will continue to happen and that&#39;s out
of our control but it&#39;s what we do with
the things that happen to us that can
make all of the difference so my name is
Amanda Southworth I&#39;m 15 years old a
junior in high school and I&#39;m still
alive
