are we alone is there a place with life
other than Earth it&#39;s a question we&#39;ve
all probably asked ourselves or at least
thought about at one point or another
it&#39;s a powerful question it&#39;s a
complicated question how do we even
begin to answer it first we need to
understand what we need to support life
anywhere even here on earth first we
need energy something to propagate a
reaction when you liquid water to
facilitate that reaction and we need
organics that can react together and
without these three ingredients we can&#39;t
support life and if we look at our own
solar system we know there&#39;s no other
planet like Earth let&#39;s start with the
inner planets at Venus where the surface
temperature averages over 460 degrees
Celsius so hot that not only is there no
liquid water but solid lead would melt
in your hand next is Mars which is a
little tricky we know there&#39;s water but
it&#39;s frozen at the poles and while the
surface temperature at the equator can
get up to 25 degrees Celsius with such a
thin atmosphere the temperature drops
below zero to negative 70 at night and
if we go any further past Mars it&#39;s too
cold even at Jupiter the next closest
planet the surface temperature is well
below zero 130 degrees Celsius colder
than dry ice so it&#39;s pretty clear life
can&#39;t exist on the surface of our solar
system
maybe George Lucas was right a long time
ago in a galaxy far far away there were
Jedi Knights fighting off Imperial
forces or Pandora&#39;s just out of sight
and one day we&#39;ll connect with the Navi
people but we don&#39;t want to wait we want
to find life now but we just looked at
our own solar system we know there&#39;s no
life on the surface so what what if we
took a
so look what if we took a look beneath
the surface about 500 million miles away
it&#39;s a very unique place first
discovered by Galileo over 400 years ago
completing its orbit around Jupiter
every three-and-a-half days is one of
its smallest moons Europa and the
surface of Europa is cold 130 degrees
below zero but as you keep going deeper
and deeper it begins to get warmer and
warmer so warm in fact that it&#39;s some
depth that ice turns to liquid water and
we know this from the Voyager and
Galileo spacecraft that have flown by
and we also know Europa surface is
active it has ridges and valleys
icebergs and cracks
all along the surface and these surface
features didn&#39;t just appear out of
nowhere something must be driving them
like maybe an ocean just beneath the
surface of the ice
it took scientists 400 years to narrow
down the field but they found it a place
that might have life outside of Earth
let&#39;s go let&#39;s start exploring after all
we&#39;ve had astronauts play golf on the
moon and there are Rovers on Mars right
now sending data back to earth so there
must be something a machine a vehicle
something that we can send to Europa but
sadly there isn&#39;t let&#39;s take a look at
what we need for the whole process first
we need a launch vehicle something that
can lift off from earth then we have to
wait six years because it takes a little
time to travel 500 million miles and
once we get there we have to slow
ourselves down from 30 miles per second
to zero softly landing on the surface
and once we&#39;re there we still have
another roadblock a sheet of ice that
could be anywhere from 10 to 30 miles
thick and once through the ice the
vehicle will have to make decisions on
its own because it takes almost 2 hours
to send and receive a response to
something that far away
whatever we send to Europa must be as
smart as one of us
and will need to be able to make
decisions on its own clearly this is no
easy task
we don&#39;t have all of these tools yet
fortunately for us there are a few
places here on earth that are covered
with ice year-round so we have a perfect
test platform but we still need a
vehicle so surely there must be
something to you study the ice caps here
on earth but again we came up empty it
turns out we&#39;ve sent more vehicles to
Mars than there are vehicles to study
our own ice shelves here on earth so as
engineers in scientists we weren&#39;t gonna
let that get in our way
presenting ice Finn our very own under
ice explorer
[Applause]
one of the hardest things when working
on an ice shelf is drilling a hole
through hundreds of meters of ice and
most hot water drills can only drill a
hole 30 to 40 centimeters in diameter
which is large enough to lower an ocean
mooring or a camera but that only gives
us data in one plane I spin at 24
centimeters in diameter can&#39;t fit
through any hole in the ice but it also
gives us data in the vertical and
horizontal planes making it a unique
creation it&#39;s also outfitted with a
three-and-a-half millimeter fiber-optic
Kevlar jacketed cable which serves two
functions first its uses communications
to send data back and forth instantly
unlike most autonomous underwater
vehicles where data is downloaded after
a mission we can see it instantly
allowing us to stop examine an
interesting feature and continue our
search and it&#39;s also used to lower the
vehicle in and out of the water if we
take a closer look we&#39;d see it&#39;s broken
down into seven individual modules each
with a specific purpose in its most
basic form you need five core modules
three thruster modules to control five
degrees of freedom a navigation module
and a control module or as I call it the
brains and with these five modules you
can take iseman anywhere but they don&#39;t
tell you anything
there&#39;s no sensors there&#39;s no cameras
it&#39;s like driving your car with a
blindfold on and if we tried to fit all
of our sensors into I spin it would be
over five meters long longer than these
tables so rather than putting them on
all at once we group them into modules
currently installed we have our survey
module installed our sonars and cameras
that allow us to characterize our
environment at a bird&#39;s eye view and
once we&#39;ve completed a mission will
remove this survey module and install
our ocean chemistry module and we can go
investigate an interesting feature
further and this modularity also allows
us to develop new modules without having
to change the design of an entire
vehicle
but more importantly it allows us to
take Iceland to some of the most remote
places in the world fortunately for me I
was able to take part in two of
Iceland&#39;s firsts I was able to be part
of a design team that brainstormed and
built this incredible vehicle but I also
got to be part of a field team for its
first season in Antarctica in 2014 the
first question I always get from people
is isn&#39;t it cold down there it&#39;s hard to
describe what it&#39;s like working in
Antarctica but I just checked the
weather and it&#39;s a balmy 27 degrees
below zero so yes it&#39;s a little cold but
we&#39;re well cared-for with big red as
it&#39;s known to keep us warm
Antarctica is an amazing place mountain
ranges for miles the occasional visit
from our steel friend Steve and even
time to eat a slice of ice cold pizza
put all jokes aside it&#39;s an incredible
place for its environment above the
surface but even more interesting below
the ice until our mission in 2014 there
were only a handful of vehicles that
have been able to take a peek under the
surface they could only dive a few
hundred meters and only search a small
area but some of these vehicles made
incredible discoveries like skinny in
2012 that captured these images of sea
anenome that buried themselves in the
ice shelf under the ice so our goal in
2014 was simple get to the bottom of the
ocean floor
and tell us what else was down there a
500 meters one doesn&#39;t expect to find
much there&#39;s no visible light from the
surface so any organism that relies on
light to survive can&#39;t and the pressure
is over 700 psi an incredible amount of
pressure that would crush almost every
living thing on our surface but when we
got to the bottom of our drill site on
the McMurdo ice shelf we were wrong
when we turned on our cameras and lights
we were amazed at the amount of life we
saw there were sea slug
and brittle stars even small fish
swimming around there was plant life
flourishing and small ice crystals that
would eventually detach from the ocean
floor to join the ice shelf above in
2014
Iceland was the first vehicle to capture
these images and this data under the
McMurdo ice shelf of the ocean floor and
it began to answer so many questions
that people started asking years ago but
it also prompted new ones what else is
down there where is it getting this
energy what else lies below and that&#39;s
what our group&#39;s been working on since
last year NASA continued our funding to
keep exploring this unknown world below
venturing even further into the ice
shelf over 400 miles away from the front
of the ice we started outfitting Iceland
with chemical sensors to detect geologic
traces in the water that could lead us
to the energy in the organics they might
be keeping these organisms alive and
we&#39;ve also started working on sampling
mechanisms they could take a water
sample right in the middle of a black
smoker on the ocean floor or tell us how
a tiny sea anenome has buried itself in
the ice shelf ice beam is one of the
most promising tools we have available
today to to explore life under the ice
we&#39;ve collected encouraging results
under the Ross Ice Shelf furthering the
hope to find life on Europa and who
knows maybe we&#39;ll catch a glimpse of
what earth was like billions of years
ago or there&#39;s a giant sea squid just
waiting for our arrival whether or not
there&#39;s life on Europa remains to be
seen but today with the help of ice fin
we&#39;re several steps closer to answering
that question thank you
