before I start I just want to say I am
really honored to be here and someone
who has been watching TED talks for a
long time this feels really unreal to me
to be invited here so thank you for
having me before I start let me just
give you a pretty introduction about
myself my name is Kareem and I&#39;ve been
blogging for over 14 years now so I&#39;m
trying to guess my age okay about your
age - same generation in these 14 years
many things have changed
I&#39;ve grown from a school girl to
university student and I married my high
school sweetheart and I have a son now
then my love is 19 months old soon and I
recently pursued my dream and started a
brighter would take just a few months
ago called the white exterior so yes
this is my beautiful family and this is
my photo studio and this is my blog now
so over the years my mom has changed
many times I&#39;ve also grown over the last
14 years about one thing has stayed the
same and that is my love for blogging
I love blogging not because I love
writing but I love sharing my life on my
blog because I know that when I share my
life someone out there may be inspired
or maybe encouraged and I just want to
share my story so that someone else can
get encouraged by it so that is my
motivation lucky all right so when
people ask me so Carrie what you do
full-time I struggle with that because
how do I introduce myself
the most common and least creaturely
reply would be that I am a blogger but
really who how does that define a
plotter anyone who owns a blog on
blogspot or WordPress is a blogger right
so there are so many blogs on internet
some no post on you know some from my 10
years ago
but we are still a blogger it is the
owner blog so that makes me no different
from the millions of blogs out there so
how do I introduce myself then the
people in the media industry they are
very kind to give us a very fancy name
so they call us the Kol anyone knows
what Kol means it means
kyoki a leader when I first heard about
it I was like okay that&#39;s nice it&#39;s very
flattering because key opinion leader
does not mean that my opinion is highly
valued that sure sounds like it
but really it is nothing more than
industry jargon because that does not
mean that my value is all high my
opinion is more highly valued than
anyone elses it&#39;s just a name and then
the Instagram phenomenon came about so
people like us who have a little bit of
dog following and social media following
we are now called
the social-media influencer honestly I
hate the term social influencer and I
really feel like I cringe at it everyone
if anyone says all your social media I
don&#39;t like you
and I really feel like this term is
flawed on so many levels I will go into
that later on but for now how do I
become a social-media influencer I have
been asked this question for so many
times over the last few years
friends and strangers alike would ask me
this question because from what they see
life&#39;s like looks pretty good on the
other side you know what we do is no you
just post a photo write some stuff about
it and get hey it looks pretty easy life
looks pretty good it looks like a dream
job right but honestly it is not like
that and yes back to back to how to
become a social-media influencer and
there is there&#39;s actually really know
how did fast rule to go about it I wish
I knew that I would have a million ten
million followers right right now I know
there is no hard and fast
becoming a successful social media
influencer you can try to take a photo
in a certain way you know you can edit
your photos we must certain BS Caufield
up you can arrange your Instagram feed
in a certain team you can crop your
caption with the most inspiring quotes
of Pinterest you can include hundreds of
trending hashtags but that does not
guarantee that you will be a well
celebrated social-media influencer so
while there are no foolproof ways to
becoming a successful social media
producer let me share with you a few
truths about social media in itself you
don&#39;t get to choose your followers your
followers choose you
unless of course if you decide to go
down the cheap road of buying fake
followers that yes you can decide who
your followers are you guys know these
things like this right yes but of course
you can get to choose who likes you out
of so many interesting accounts on
Instagram out of so many millions of
videos are loaded on YouTube every
single day what is it that makes people
decide to click on a follow button and
click on the subscribe button the answer
is to be yourself now I know this is a
very cliche thing and you&#39;re you&#39;re here
you know what if you&#39;re something new
right you&#39;re not get Industry Insights
right now why am I telling you something
and you could hundred times before but
really there is no hard and fast rule
the secret is to be yourself don&#39;t you
aren&#39;t you happy then some of your
favorite social media influencers are
celebrities they didn&#39;t decide to be
like somebody else in this whole world
that can only be 1/3 they can only be
one Ryan Higa that can only be one
wongfuproductions anyone who tries to be
like that will be labeled on copy I&#39;m
very glad that right you got in decide
to become like somebody else because if
then if so if he decides to be like
you wouldn&#39;t be how he is today and I&#39;m
a huge fan of his videos
anyone else and I really love the sense
of human so I am very glad that you
decided to be himself and that is the
way to go you just have to be yourself
you know create your own unique content
every one of us we have something
special to bring online maybe it&#39;s your
story maybe you you have a certain skill
or you have some creative at work I can
show you no you can&#39;t you can publish on
my Instagram or maybe some of you you
have really good fitness tips or makeup
tips or lifestyle hacks
whatever it is you have something unique
to offer so be yourself so I&#39;m trying to
be like everybody else I&#39;m gonna show
you another cliche code be yourself
because everyone else is already taken
it is not as glamorous
I want you say yeah lie your bloggers so
glamorous you know you look so good on a
time on your Instagram and you get so
many freebies all the time and people
know you it is not as glamorous so
today&#39;s theme is party perks right so
let me take you into my world and show
you the behind the scenes of what
happens when you are a social-media
influencer
so basically when we post reviews and
ads on our Instagram and Facebook and
blog they are called sponsored post okay
this is the industry jargon sponsored
post
so how sponsored post start is clients
who you should be is that as an email
telling hands hey hi Kareem hi Bella
platform which agency or which company
and I&#39;m interested to engage you for it
is campaign or for this collaboration or
for this project for this in fact these
are the words that you use and they&#39;ll
usually tell me okay this is the time
looking at three postings throughout the
next one month and these are the
directions first you know you put a
positive product in a lifestyle way be
as natural as possible you know don&#39;t be
too much self I showed my product make
sure the logo is visible don&#39;t see
anything bad about it but be honest
[Music]
don&#39;t mention competitors don&#39;t show
competitor brands there are many many
directions so we receive a brief with
all these details but if the posting
Nate but we should something our draft
to the client so because we are engaged
we get a certain remuneration right so
we get our products and sometimes you
get pay men sometimes we get both so
because um we are on a professional
working relationship we have to make
sure that the client gets what the
client expects right so as long as a
client is not happy with the photo do I
have to keep resending and do they&#39;re
happy it is not an easier right
something good about it post it up and
get paid and it&#39;s not like that same
goes for captions
sometimes our captions get revised again
and again and sometimes they are very
easygoing so do say that okay I just
used to post on this tape regardless of
the time specified some tires are quite
particular by the time so do tell you
can create this posting needs to go up

on one at 1:15 p.m.
yeah so Tiger the lunch crowd you know
some day before the rush hour crowd
hungry for the night crowd so we get
clients who are particular and somewhat
more relaxed sometimes payers within one
week some longer some extreme and some
x6 - something forever stuff go missing
is that at least happened once to most
of us you know we don&#39;t get our pay men
or it just applies just disappear so
these are the things that probably
you&#39;ve never heard of because people are
sort of is industry will not usually get
to know but what I&#39;m trying to say is it
is not as glamorous it is not it is all
curated everything you see on social
media is not candid when someone tells
you have any picture don&#39;t return it&#39;s
not ended you know get a picture is
never that work with me when I take any
love is never with you you know I was
keeping and somebody took my picture
horror can be but it&#39;s not
it is never accidental nothing happens
by chance
everything that you see on Instagram on
those squares have carefully planned and
created to represent the branding that I
want you to see I want you to sleep as a
happy-go-lucky girl next door all my
photos have a big white smile I&#39;m always
happy I&#39;m always having brunch I&#39;m
always happy spa
I am always chilling like it&#39;s great you
know I have a perfect relationship
everything is created but is it wrong
for them to cure it yeah Instagram that
way it is not their fault because
everybody wants to portray the best side
right nobody wants to pull upset moments
of the accused a crime and satrapy
nobody wants to do that
you know then do be label and
attention-seeking right so we cannot
please everybody it&#39;s so nobody is at
fault at this so now that we know people
want to post happy things on social
media because they just want to remember
the happy things so us and the viewers
we have the responsibility to tell
ourselves that it is all curator nothing
is the full picture it is not a full
picture
when you see somebody are posting about
the reason for recent vacation
keep on throwing back they are all
photos from navigation then you feel
like what is person always on vacation
so good and I&#39;m here you know I&#39;m not
sure this was probably from three years
ago I guess you&#39;re throwing back the
photos they took so many photos you know
and I feel like if the world is to see
it it&#39;s so much hard work and if I
really must show you it is not a full
picture like many people like anything
that you see online are happy moments
the highlights the birthday party also
girls and my friends throw me a surprise
birthday party marriage proposals fancy
dinners what else
Oh a new sneaker that just dropped and I
just bought it first one in Malaysia
right and you know all these are the
highlights the happy laughing baby but
nobody shows you the times when they
argue with their partners when they dig
into their savings when they eat up and
for lunch when they get a sleep last
night because the baby kids might not
start at night because somebody asked me
before like we what you mean you argue
with your husband you don&#39;t like you
have the perfect marriage on line
when I heard that I was so shocked I was
speechless and that got me thinking was
it my fault for posting our happy photos
online that I pinned such a perfect
picture of my life that people think my
life is flawless I really really thought
about it
and I came to a conclusion that no it is
actually not really my fault because
everybody wants to post happy days right
nobody wants to post settings and you
get these for you mind you who were so
sad about you
[Music]
remember to highlight the happy things
so it is not alcohol
so other test users we have to remind
ourselves that it is not the full
picture it is all curated don&#39;t do it
for the money
everyone tells you the same thing for
every Korea right yeah do it for passion
do it because you like it not because of
the money because when you do it for the
money it shows when you do it for the
money you are impatient you cannot wait
and then whatever you do becomes think
so I know some on Instagram brands who
are doing very well Instagram they are
earning money from the granite Facebook
and then they feel like hundred and more
so they started a blog so do you want to
be a blogger so then you can earn more
income non-psychic come from blogging
but all they talk about our products and
[Music]
who wants to read heads all the time it
is like an online viewbot full of eggs
it&#39;s just like walking into a cinema and
all they show you are two hours worth of
hats nobody likes that and your back
fire my clients see that your content is
like that and then nobody actually reads
your blog anymore they won&#39;t pay for you
to blog about our products and then they
don&#39;t give you everything back find us
in a third world when you do it for the
money so do it because you like it do it
because you enjoy it do it because you
have a passion for it so how does enjoy
social media without getting unhealthy
any one of you have actually wondered
before like why do we enjoy being on
social media so much I have wondered
because sometimes I realize that
whenever I have some free time in my
hands and a traffic light or at home and
I just got back just sit on a couch the
first thing that I do I just pick on my
phone open it Instagram app and if first
thing is the check who like was cool I
what allies and who would you follow
would you comment
just checking on activity ID then I&#39;m
going to see okay who a bit new things
Oh - these photos right like like like I
become very fidgety I don&#39;t actually
read the captions and BlueCross if I
like I&#39;m just Restless so I just
alternate from one app to another
Instagram okay finish out the thing is
he off in Italy then I open the Facebook
app same thing and they really okay I
read a few polls and a better Instagram
Facebook this can go on for three hours
and without me realizing this has
happened before like my husband oh I&#39;m
sorry friends around yeah yeah I&#39;ll just
get myself the company and I need some
rest I&#39;ll read a book you know you know
rest early and then you come back yeah
it&#39;s been jealous oh and you&#39;re sleeping
there on the couch so why do we love
being on social media so much it is
because when we get a positive response
from people and like a comment our brain
sends a signal that that mean well we
are accomplished successful and we
receive this reward molecules that we
get when we do certain things in life
like exercising or setting a goal and
achieving a goal so if you accomplish
with your happy so when we receive a
like a new photo wall new comment a new
view when I oh my god we get emotional
high as much as social media gives you
happiness makes you feel accomplished it
can also make you feel down and bring
yourself and Steve to a whole new low
the next second so I have a story to
share and have a confession to make
being someone who makes its money from
social media and I live in really social
media for so many years now I think
number is very seriously because clients
are all about numbers you know why
should I pay you
you are your photo girls are not as high
but you know it&#39;s all about numbers it&#39;s
all about pitch burns likes cognates
right so I always told myself numbers
are important you know what I must make
sure that I do well my numbers then I
have a blogger friends for one day came
up to me and say hey have you heard this
ad you know this person unfollowed me
you know I&#39;m like oh you know like you
never hope is that so I was introduced
to this app anyone heard of it how is
laughing like she&#39;ll go okay so this is
the follows a and apparently that is so
awesome
it shows you how women do we how well
each pose is doing but which is the best
performing pose and which is that well
how well you&#39;re doing for this might
happen your followers events new
comments yeah it shows all these things
but he also shows you who and follow you
it shows you who exactly follow you I
was like oh my gosh I mean I make a lot
of Chopra I mean I always tell myself
that and the kind right if my husband we
have a slow I want to know that show you
don&#39;t have for me some some girls did
they were seven like knowing my husband
showed me I got the door ignorance is
bliss and I can I want to know so yeah
problem right so I thought I thought I
need to know who I follow me is that I
can fix the problem
so at first I use this I know I really
enjoyed it
like when strangers and follow me I
didn&#39;t feel paper I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know
them it&#39;s okay until I start to see
acquaintances and friends appearing and
unfollow list
and then I I get shot the first time I
saw it I was like and money seeing it
wrong and why were my friend unfollow me
then all these questions I thought have
come into my head like what did I do
wrong
did I say something wrong - that person
get a day all this nonsense stuff at the
club I hid it&#39;s my photo so ugly
then shares to unfollow me am I not
chipster it not go beyond his red light
and I too happy then no - I had before
but he&#39;s more you know he likes
minimally stuff but I&#39;m too mainstream
or maybe maybe because of that maybe the
future is bright
you know I ask all these questions and I
keep bugging my husband and my sisters
and other what is wrong with my kid look
at my feet but it&#39;s strong is it too
many Facebook
I don&#39;t even after that is it I don&#39;t
have enough fast shot too much of my
face too much on baby
you know I became crazy I came to
unhappy
I knew social media because it is a job
and I was controlled by it each time my
lights go up comments go out a host as
well people started to follow me I get
an emotional high I feel so great the
next second I can feel like my whole
world is shaken like why is my name
right I&#39;m following me why am i doing so
badly what is wrong I keep asking myself
so the primary response when this
happens is that I&#39;ll ask myself a lot of
questions I ask myself why and then our
few lines okay
I also follow you
because y&#39;all follow me and follow your
Baba
I am so quite thick skin no I also like
one people too you know I don&#39;t people
to see me like revengeful because these
very obvious right if they follow me I&#39;m
also told in you know I discrete so do
so good keep track of her although she
so I didn&#39;t want her to know so much my
kid not that one now my continue to be
the bigger person and I continue to
follow them to see that so I&#39;ve become
like that and then one day as I was
checking in my sister she was telling me
that she delivered her I introduced it
to her
now I said why did you delete such an
awesome ahead you know no other app
shows you such things and then she&#39;s
like yes but it made me unhappy
something I deleted I was like that&#39;s a
good point but I want to know the
reality said I can fix it right so yeah
I wanna continue using but as I was
reflecting on my life last year and of
last year I was setting my new year&#39;s
resolution and then on I was telling
myself okay I want to be happy this year
I really want to be happy I want to
spend quality time with my loved ones I
want to keep that the fullest attention
attention that I deserve I don&#39;t want my
emotions to spray it up and down left
and right just because someone is a ton
below me so I call myself I&#39;m gonna
carry out this monster in my life
that monster is that Larry sorry I
didn&#39;t adapt since 1st of January 20
something I never touched it I never be
downloaded it I don&#39;t know who I follow
me and I don&#39;t care
I realized that but you take control
things that control you your life will
change maybe today&#39;s social media is
something that affects you so greatly
maybe it&#39;s the things that people say I
think you know about you that controls
your limits view makes you unhappy and I
want to encourage you if that is social
media go on a social media break still
in the app for one week two weeks three
months six months one year if you need
to regain perspective of why you want to
use social media it&#39;s because you enjoy
using it or is it because you want to
prove something or is it because you&#39;re
controlled by it sometimes when my
emotions are not right I know that it
negative I try not to go on social media
because there will only make me even
more upset I never get happier if your
emotions are not in the right state
don&#39;t go on social media because
everything that you see would be a
comparison every happy moment are other
people have is them being genuinely
happy for them your compare YouTube
channels so if you need thicker social
media bread come back happier and
healthier I&#39;m gonna end really soon but
back to why I hate the term social-media
influencer it is because really a rich
point of your following that you&#39;re
considered influential is it because
when you hit 10,000 then you are like oh
whatever you say matters is it when you
hit 50,000 half a million 2 million 30
million a vicious point are you
considered influential let&#39;s not mention
Twitter
influence is not measured by numbers it
is not measured by the followers
influence is measure towards by the
transmitter your audience has towards
you so for example if I see a friend not
a social-media influencer just
followers she shared something about a
new cafe that&#39;s just opened the food
looks great and she says great things
about it it makes me feel like I want to
visit it right and y&#39;all
yes yeah I&#39;m not the only one getting
influenced by food right so does that
mean my friend is a social-media
influencer but she has 100 followers it
doesn&#39;t matter you would trust a friend
who says a good thing about certain
products at a place more than a
social-media influencer with half a
million followers then you have no
trusted relationship with right so if
you are a social-media influencer you
may only have 50 followers or 10 but you
are social-media influencer whatever you
say whatever you post online has an
influence it has a power to change
somebody&#39;s life somebody&#39;s view yeah you
have the power to inspire somebody you
know and it is really my wish that we
look out of social media I&#39;d always feel
it coming from me because I need every
social media but honestly I really don&#39;t
care about social media oh yeah I step
out of it and maybe some what do you
need to step out of it so it is really
my wish to see that more people would
focus on becoming real life influencers
that&#39;s social influencer because you may
have five hundred thousand followers on
Instagram but zero influence in your
life zero influence towards the people
around you you have so many people that
you can impact in a positive way and
it&#39;s not just on social media yes people
sitting next to you people that you meet
every day so I really want to encourage
you go there create something good you
know be a positive influence
use your voice in a positive way and
that&#39;s all from me
[Applause]
like anybody and I recalled that you
will enjoy using social media in a
healthy way thank you
