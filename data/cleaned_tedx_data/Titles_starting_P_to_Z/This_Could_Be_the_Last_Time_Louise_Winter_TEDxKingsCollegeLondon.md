it was just another day in Phil&#39;s life
he&#39;d had a long day at work and all he
wanted to do was take his shoes off sit
on the sofa and watch his favorite soaps
with a can of beer but before he could
do that his dog Benson needed to go for
a walk so he headed to the park and
decided to play a game of ball but as he
was playing he tripped fell and smashed
his head against the concrete of the
pavement as he was bleeding another dog
walker called 999 but Phil never made it
home that night or ever again he died in
the ambulance on the way to hospital
Dave had recently retired he&#39;d spent 50
years working in his accountant and was
looking forward to spending his
retirement in the garden reading the
paper and seeing his grandchildren one
day his wife June decided to pop to the
shops for a while so Dave took the
opportunity to mow the lawn he got to
the awkward bit by the petunias when he
felt a pain in his chest the pain was
his heart he fell went into
unconsciousness if he always later June
returned home from doing the shopping
she put on the careful made a cup of tea
and headed outside to the garden to see
her husband but it was too late
Dave had already died Katie was having a
tough summer it was the middle of her
a-levels and she really wasn&#39;t enjoying
them very much but she was looking
forward to a long summer spent with her
friends before University the night
before her final a level history exam
she decided to take an hour off and have
a pizza with her big sister
she went to bed as usual and the next
morning her mom shouted her downstairs
saying the breakfast was ready but she
never came downstairs her mom found her
in bed she had died in her sleep as a
funeral director I am faced with the
brutal reality of death every single day
in my line of work there is no escaping
the fact that we are all going to die
the evidence is in the mortuary every
morning I go into work and the smell of
death hits me my phone rings because
someone has died and my assistance is
required heart attacks
mystery illnesses terrorist incidents
murders suicides car crashes tragic
accidents even simple hospital
procedures gone wrong on average 1,000
people died in London every single week
that&#39;s a lot of people who just don&#39;t
have a tomorrow inspired by all these
funerals I very quickly got into the
habit of saying this could be the last
time as inspired as I was my boyfriend
at the time even had my words tattooed
onto his arm in my handwriting but as a
funeral director I&#39;m not only faced with
the brutal reality of death it&#39;s also
the brutal reality of life my job is to
support people who are in the midst of
going through what is possibly the most
difficult devastating and traumatic time
of their life and so I see how it
affects them so lying in bed one night I
added something to my boyfriend&#39;s arm
this could be the last time his touch he
said but it probably won&#39;t I added in by
room you see Phil who never came home
after his walk in the park was survived
by his wife his neighbors and his dog
Benson Dave who
retired only to have a heart attack and
died was survived by his wife his
children their children his nieces and
nephews the people he&#39;d worked with for
over 50 years the men he drank with at
the pub and everyone he knew to say
hello to including the milkman and Katie
whose death remains unexplained
to this day was survived by her sister
her parents her grandparents her school
friends her netball team and absolutely
everyone who knew her online really
quite well but had never met her all of
these people had a tomorrow and it was a
tomorrow they had to find a way to live
with now I&#39;ve learned so much from these
people about how dealing with the very
difficult emotions around death can
really transform our lives up until the
age of 25 I had never even attended a
funeral so I was totally overwhelmed
when my granddad was diagnosed with
terminal cancer and I had to face the
prospect of my first ever death I spent
18 months anticipating how it was going
to feel expecting a deep darkness like
depression but grief came in many shades
it wasn&#39;t just darkness there was joy
gratitude sadness and anger in there as
well I soon realized that grief was so
much more overwhelming unpredictable and
complicated than I ever could have
imagined
everyone&#39;s reaction to death is very
different and whatever you&#39;re feeling it
is ok now after Phil&#39;s very sudden and
tragic death I spent some time with his
widow Angela planning his funeral we
wasted 30 years of our life she told me
we just spent our time bickering and
arguing about everything and absolutely
nothing and now he is gone and I have to
spend the rest of my life knowing that
we wasted our time together I never get
another opportunity a neighbor Barbara
tried very hard to console her she said
Angie you&#39;ve just got to stop crying
this can&#39;t go on you&#39;ve got to get on
with your life you&#39;ve got to see the
good things you&#39;ve got to celebrate all
the good things that you did together
and you know don&#39;t sit around moping
over him he wouldn&#39;t want you wasting
your tears whatever you&#39;re feeling it&#39;s
okay in my early twenties when
depression led me to not want him to be
here anymore
I was so used to people telling me not
to be so silly that I had everything to
live for and that I should be feeling
something in fact anything apart from
the reality of what I was actually
feeling one day a friend took me for a
walk in the park
she let me talk without interrupting and
at the end he simply nodded and said I
totally get why you would want to leave
whatever you&#39;re feeling it&#39;s okay
diminishing other people&#39;s feelings or
telling them how they should and
shouldn&#39;t be feeling doesn&#39;t help even
if it&#39;s well-intentioned now another
thing that I&#39;ve learned from the many
people I&#39;ve worked with is that owning
what is going on and saying it as it is
is really valuable so when I first
started working in funerals I would
arrive at someone&#39;s house knock on the
door introduce myself wonder whether to
take my shoes off or not and then wonder
how on earth I was going to express my
condolences for what had happened to
them sounding genuine sincere and honest
which I was but it&#39;s very difficult to
word so what I would do is say something
which I felt was right such as I&#39;m sorry
for your loss or sorry about your
husband and then pause and wait for
their reaction and their reactions were
always very interesting and very
telling one was it is what it is
in other words oh well never mind
followed by a grief starstruck look into
the distance and another was just oh
thanks love cup of tea but now my
approach is much more direct than that
I&#39;m so sorry that your sister katie has
died I&#39;m sorry that this terrible thing
has happened to you and your family by
owning what has happened by saying it as
it is we give everyone else permission
to do the same unlike most of the
British funeral industry I don&#39;t talk in
euphemisms no one in my care is lost
no one has passed away no one is
sleeping or at rest
I used the word staff dying died and
dead although very gently no one is
called the deceased I call them the
person who&#39;s died or controversially
their actual name by saying things as
they are we&#39;re able to own them and
because of that actually deal with them
very early on I realized that death that
grief even doesn&#39;t just belong to death
grief is the complex set of emotions we
feel whenever we are faced with a
situation which we probably don&#39;t want
to be in either anticipating a situation
that&#39;s happening or something is going
to happen and we have to find a way to
live with that now grief doesn&#39;t just
notice feel grief when someone has died
grief also belongs to any kind of change
the end of a relationship the end of a
friendship a career falling apart pet
dying a grandparent dying is the very
key one and the lives we could have
lived the people we could have been the
places we could have gone the people we
could have known the one who left the
one who stayed the life we could have
lived if only life didn&#39;t get in the way
the ex-boyfriend with your words
permanently tattooed
as on the list is endless as a society
we don&#39;t really have any way of dealing
with grief our funerals tell us to
diminish how we&#39;re feeling to keep calm
and to carry on June could barely pour
me a cup of tea she was shaking so much
when I went to her house to talk about
Dave&#39;s funeral her hand was shaking so
much she couldn&#39;t sign the cremation
paperwork which was needed for his
funeral to go ahead I&#39;m really sorry I&#39;m
just terrible at funerals she said to me
it&#39;s okay
it&#39;s a funeral you&#39;re not supposed to be
good at it our funeral poetry tells us
to diminish how we&#39;re feeling it tells
us not to feel what it is we&#39;re really
feeling we&#39;re supposed to smile laugh
and just get on with our lives we&#39;re
absolutely not to cry shed any tears and
God forbid you stand at anyone&#39;s grave
and weep we&#39;re told that life goes on
and that everything will be just the
same as it always was but when someone
dies everything changes
pain demands to be felt and if we don&#39;t
feel it it will find a way to leak out
into the rest of our lives
alcoholism addiction pills breakdowns
workaholism the list is endless
bereavement is what happens to us grief
is what we feel and mourning is what we
do now I do my morning on Instagram do
you ever want to know how I&#39;m feeling
then just take out my Instagram account
you won&#39;t find any pictures of kittens
or latte art but you will find a very
real depiction of my inner emotional
landscape in pixel form
I don&#39;t repress my grief I express it
and by doing so over time it&#39;s changed
and it&#39;s just not so crippling anymore
as a society we need a modern way of
mourning
we need funerals that actually serve
their purpose
we need funeral poetry that lets us feel
what we&#39;re really feeling without
telling us otherwise
we need to know that it&#39;s okay to cry in
the frozen peas aisle of Tesco we need
to know that it&#39;s okay not to be okay
and we need permission to do whatever it
is until we don&#39;t need to do it anymore
[Music]
by repressing our grief we rob ourselves
of the opportunity not just to treat
life and death with reverence acceptance
gratitude and many things but to do the
same with our emotions our funerals are
important they are our emotional legacy
if done well they give the people who
survived us a space to feel and to
accept and acknowledge that their lives
will never be the same again the most
powerful funeral I was ever involved
with was for a lady who died very
suddenly in a car crash now her husband
decided that he didn&#39;t have any words to
express how he felt about her death so
at the funeral we didn&#39;t have any words
the only sound was the wind rustling in
the trees and birdsong as her coffin was
lowered into the grave there might not
have been any words but the emotional
volume was deafening even though I work
with death every single day it&#39;s not
realistic to truly live the life that I
want to live every single moment dealing
healthily and brilliantly with every
difficult emotion that comes up but I
can live alive
dealing with what comes up when it
happens making decisions which won&#39;t
negatively affect tomorrow whilst also
knowing that if I don&#39;t have a tomorrow
I won&#39;t regret how I spent today because
this could be the last time but it
probably won&#39;t be thank you
you
