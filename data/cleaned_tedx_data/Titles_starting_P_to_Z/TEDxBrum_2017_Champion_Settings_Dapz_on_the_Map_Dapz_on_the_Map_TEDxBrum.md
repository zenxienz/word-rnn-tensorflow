that song that I just performed is
called mini valley for those who don&#39;t
know who I am at all see me for the
first time that song is called mini

that song
it was I&#39;ve done a show or two Academy
know by the hire anyone from Birmingham

should be done it ourselves and we sold
it out any thanks without that yeah so
we sold it out and I felt like I felt
like I felt like a champion like wah my

my friends and so you&#39;ve done that I
mean you wake up the next morning and
he&#39;s still feeling like a champion and a
couple weeks later you still feeling
like a champion like sold out of your -

and I&#39;m thinking wow like it&#39;s gonna
happen it&#39;s gonna happen I&#39;ve been the
message my manager about like a couple
days ago oh we don&#39;t know how to help
that&#39;s move-in
he&#39;s already helping himself so you can
imagine like that&#39;s the cue for that oh
and you know yeah yeah yeah
so that happened then I was like nah man
I&#39;ve Stewart champ though because I&#39;ve
still done what I&#39;ve done I can&#39;t forget
that so then after that what happened

Warner and we went to Warner they were
saying the same thing they knew a bit
more though they they had their blinkers
on there was a bit more away but the
same thing happened yeah when you finish

this is all I do I don&#39;t I don&#39;t this is
my job I don&#39;t have I don&#39;t work this is
this is work so money started to get a
little bit low now because you&#39;re not
making you&#39;re not putting out any music
any more because labels are interested
so you don&#39;t really want to give out
your best music anymore because you&#39;re
thinking all someone&#39;s gonna take it
from me and that&#39;s what we want to do
