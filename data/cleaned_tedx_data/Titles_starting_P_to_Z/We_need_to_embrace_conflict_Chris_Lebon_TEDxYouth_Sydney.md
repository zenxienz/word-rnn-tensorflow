we all hate conflict right fighting it&#39;s
bad right we are taught to avoid
conflict
don&#39;t fight rise above it
ignore the bullies don&#39;t get bored and
then they&#39;ll leave you alone
well maybe not conflict has been a part
of my journey my life it&#39;s in my genes
in my family in here in Australia I was
confronted challenged and bullied but as
an adult I decided to try something new
as a lonely scraggly kid with a bowl cut
with a few friends my parents enrolled
me in to a local dojo in Cabramatta I
had been bullied I even tried to stand
up for other kids at school but I always
ended up on my back beaten up conflict
sucks doesn&#39;t it my parents put me into
the dojo to learn the art of
self-defense to become unpick honorable
or bully proof I was obsessed with
watching kung fu movies as it was the
only thing that gave me solace at that
time I love the dojo but I wasn&#39;t really
in it for self-defense
well not really as a martial artist one
of the first few things that I learned
that radically changed the way I lived
today is to increase safety move towards
the conflict engage in your opponent
in kung-fu movies Jackie Chan doesn&#39;t
avoid conflict and when you avoid
fighting you&#39;re coming from a place of
fear and I wanted to learn how to be
strong now my mother she was jailed for
more than six times before finally
fighting away onto a small boat to a
refugee camp in Malaysia
my father was put into re-education in a
prison where he spent almost six years
malnourished in in solitary confinement
by the time I was born they had both
made it to Australia to start new lives
they left the war behind them but they
never confronted it we never spoke about
it we all hated conflict their version
of strength is quiet they even tried to
avoid the conflict my parents were too
busy burying themselves in coping in
this new country learning a new language
finding work starting this new life but
their traumatic experiences my homelands
conflict was dormant left unchallenged
within my parents and it never went away
growing up I saw this fear fester in
them they had escaped but they weren&#39;t
able to move on from the war my father
turned to gambling and then became an
alcoholic my mother found work in
Vietnam in a marketing company
but in Australia she was working in a
sweatshop doing 10-hour days she fell
into anxiety depression she was either
sad or angry at herself sewing hems
sleeves and collars day-in day-out and
despite all of this they never once
spoke about it it was thought that it
would have brought shame on to my family
if the community knew about it conflict
avoidant praying that like the bullies
if they didn&#39;t fight back their ghost is
would leave them alone meanwhile the
only thing that kept me going was
martial arts and it wasn&#39;t to fight back
the bullies or my parents but it was for
my own strength and power my arms my
legs and the awareness of my mind I drew
strength from working on myself
and I was a learning a different way on
being strong high-energy punches a
strong and fast but still loose paired
with your legs and kicks and it&#39;s up to
your minds intent what you want to do
with them but physical strength forms
and skills can be learnt and taught it&#39;s
up to the artistic conception a true
martial artist is only perceived from
within
therefore it was essential to master
physical movement and martial skills it
was more crucial to train the mind in
the spirit and cultivate the Chi we need
some brace conflict as it is what drives
us and like the kung-fu action heroes
our authentic life is not free from
struggle we need to engage embrace
conflict as it is what drives us forward
no conflict didn&#39;t stop when I left
school bullies and learnt martial arts I
grew up I completed a psychology degree
but deep down inside I wanted to be
creative I wanted to make films action
films but to my parents being an artist
being creative were dirty forbidden
words being an artist to them was
equivalent to being unemployed so I was
going to have to fight that one as well
now martial arts has taught me well I
was precise in the dojo I learned to be
disciplined structured and free-flowing
I step back like a punch I decided that
I wanted to live my life kick-ass and
like the heroes of my favorite movies
Jackie Chan the hero&#39;s journey that I
knew so well I wanted to turn my life
into a film so to speak the hero Mead
started off in an ordinary world
programmed by the learnings of my
parents to fear the world to be conflict
avoidant but then go on an adventure
challenge themselves in a decisive
crisis wins the victory comes home
changed and transformed what was going
to be my adventure of my life how do I
challenge myself to become a hero and to
be strong I wanted to be in action film
but I grew up frustrated with Australian
film and television I mean I don&#39;t know
about you but there&#39;s not many Asian
Australian women kicking ass on
primetime TV so I was going to have to
fight that one too but in 2009 I decided
to do something pretty random
I made a public declaration that I was
on the quest to find Jackie Chan I mean
Jackie Chan is like the biggest Asian
superstar in the whole wide world and I
was the biggest strange kid from Western
Sydney and you know to be honest with
you Jackie Chan he&#39;s not like a relative
from China or anything I had no
connection to him but that dream it was
something bigger that I thought would
ever be possible and as a screenwriter
of my own life it was the most biggest
ridiculous idea that could come from a
bully kid from Western Sydney and I
persisted in this quest my movie
campaigning every australian capital
city and hong kong and then i was
stranded in china broke less there&#39;s
only $20 and still no Jackie Chan&#39;s but
here&#39;s a bit of a twist in my story if
you imagine the next eight years as a
kind of montage I kept on working hard
martial arts had taught me to be a
warrior you must commit to your
objective without shame or doubt I had
failed to meet Jackie my quest
but I wasn&#39;t going to give up every
warrior must commit to the the objective
regardless of what people say we often
to afraid that what we publicly declare
to people were seen as taken too
seriously or what if we fail I adopted a
warrior&#39;s mindset and continued training
making my own movies in Western Sydney I
got roles in China and Vietnam but there
I had to deal with a new set of
challenges in the martial arts action
genre less than 1% of directors are
females who get to work with action
hence as a female action director it was
rare now in martial arts every move
comes with a risk whether you take
sexism in ignore it or draw a line every
single action that you make can invite
the unknown into your life I was made
fun of on set I was called weak a silly
girl some of my co actors would even ask
me are you going to show me how to punch
like a girl and I did I embrace conflict
I understood that conflict is always
around us and that success can come at
the price of someone else but failure
can rock your whole entire life that&#39;s a
battle that&#39;s a war and I learnt
something else people became drawn
towards me stood beside me when they saw
me take a stance against sexism I got a
chance to train up to do my own stunts
to choreograph fight scenes and I think
it reminded them of their own strength
the potential warrior from within last
year I was hired by someone from the
action film industry this time it was a
long side of wait for it Jackie Chan
[Applause]
after eight years my own personal movie
has come to a resolution I got a chance
to work with Jackie on his film and
after that I got a chance to go on a
road trip with him to camera to visit
his parents home and then right before
he flew back to China
I shared a moment with Jackie and this
is what I said Jackie you like my dad no
seriously that&#39;s exactly what I said out
of all things but I guess things have
come full circle for me and my family
and living kick-ass comes in all shapes
and sizes but you can&#39;t do it afraid you
have to find ways to publicly declare
your dreams be ready to meet the
challenges in conflicts that comes up
along the way with powerful fluid
strength my parents had finally come
around to creativity and the arts my dad
is now into competitive karaoke and mum
she&#39;s passionate about Friday night
disco dancing thank you
