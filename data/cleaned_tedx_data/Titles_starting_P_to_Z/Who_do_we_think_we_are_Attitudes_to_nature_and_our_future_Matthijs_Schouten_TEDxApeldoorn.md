who do we think we are
are we humans the owners of this planet
are the mountains ours the seas the
rivers or are we
stewards to the earth or are we partners
to all animals to all plants to all that
lives or are we simply part of nature
now you may say now these are
interesting philosophical questions that
should be answered in academic
classrooms they do not really concern me
that would be a serious misconception it
is crucial that each and every one of us
considers our attitude to nature and now
more so than ever before we live in
extraordinary times global crises are
unfolding that threaten our future
there&#39;s an alarming decrease in
biodiversity even within the duration of
this dog it&#39;s quite likely that again
another plant or animal species has
become extinct through human impact and
then there is the human induced change
in climate which will affect all
life-forms on this planet there&#39;s no
doubt that unless we change the way in
which we treat the earth our home that
were seriously endangering our own
well-being and the well-being of all
life on this planet now the way in which
we treat the way in which we treat the
earth that is connected to the image
that we have of ourselves in this world
the image of the human nature
relationship or we could say it is
connected to who we think we are and we
all have a certain image of the human
each relationship and certain attitude
to nature and that attitude is formed
during our lives and has two basic roots
one root is our personal life history
it makes a difference whether you&#39;re
born in the city or in the countryside
because that determines whether you&#39;re
coming to contract contact with nature
and how you come into contact with
nature
I myself was born in a small village in
the south of the Netherlands surrounded
by woodlands surrounded by heathens and
all my childhood every free hour I spent
in nature and that had a great impact on
me I still vividly remember the call of
the kukuana summer afternoon order the
fragrance of the wild honeysuckle do you
remember your first kiss you see when
you for the first time foreign
passionately in love and she at your
first passionate kiss in the middle of a
woodland your attitude to nature will
forever be different from one when that
would have happened in a nightclub but
it&#39;s not only our personal experience
that shape our attitude to nature and
other rude is in the cultural context in
which we grow up because cultural
systems also hold views also hold ideas
and they are transferred to us by our
parents or educators our teachers the
books we read the media we watch when
you&#39;re as a child mesmerized by a spider
and your mother tells you to kill it
that shapes your attitude and when you
read in a newspaper that nature
conservation stands in the way of
economic development that shapes your
attitude now we in our Western
civilization have traditionally held the
view that nature is a resource that is
there for us and that we own it and this
idea emerged in the Classical period
Aristotle the great philosopher
Aristotle designed a hierarchy of
natural things a great ladder of being
starting with minerals lower plants
higher plants lower animals higher
animals and finally humans and stated
that in this ladder of being it is the
purpose of the lower to serve the higher
now later classical philosophers
translated this into the idea that the
gods had designed nature to serve the
highest being on earth
the human being and that idea was
adopted by Christianity and as such
became very infant influential in the
Western world some theologians claimed
that God had created today so that
humans could go to work and I&#39;ve created
tonight humans could rest not created
fleas so that humans would not rest too
long and the great British scholar Henry
Moore wrote in the 17th century God has
created cows in order to Keith to keep
beef fresh for human consumption
now most people our society now do not
think in terms of a God who designed
nature for human purposes but many
people find it self-evident that nature
is ours but it is there for us to use
and this idea I think is plays an
important part in the ecological crisis
in the climate crisis because we treat
the earth as a commodity we use it we
abuse it we exploit it to exhaust it we
destroy now not all cultural traditions
health the view that humans are owners
of nature the Jewish tradition it is
said that we own humans do not own the
planet but at the tenants of God&#39;s
creation and that implies that we should
take good care of the earth that were
stewards of the earth and that image is
also present in the Islamic tradition
and there are attitudes not so very long
ago I was in Burma and Myanmar and at a
certain moment a car broke down in the
middle of nowhere and we reached a small
petrol station and we had to wait for
another car to pick us up at a certain
moment a snake slithered across the road
and the owner of the octave of the
petrol station grabbed the snake and ran
onto the road and what do you think he
did no no no no they used to stick to
carefully push it across the road so
that it would not be killed by a car you
see many Burmese Buddhists and for
Buddhists animals our fellow creatures
that also have a right to be there and
should not be harmed
they they are considered
harder than people persons that&#39;s what
Native Americans called plans and
animals of course they&#39;re not people but
they&#39;re persons
they&#39;re beings with a personality of
their own and this is another attitude
this is the attitude of partnership
humans and nature in partnership I may
ask you who feels that we own nature who
feels that were stewards of nature no
one who feels that we&#39;re partners of
nature I would still like to carry it
one step further in all these images
owner Stuart partner there&#39;s a
separation between humans and nature
they&#39;re separate domains but can we
separate ourselves from nature can we
exist independent of nature are we not
on every breath we take or nectar to the
plants that produce or oxygen other not
all kinds of minerals in our bodies that
originate from the rocks of this earth
and we not feed every day on the
products of nature we cannot exist
independent of nature that&#39;s why some
philosophers has have claimed that we
are not entities in this world but
entities of this world and the
Vietnamese Zen master Thich that Han
speaks about inter be nothing and no one
can exist independent of all the rest we
exist because all the rest exists and
therefore we enter our with the world
that means that our personal being is
intimately linked to the well-being of
this earth and this is an other attitude
this is the attitude of participation of
interbeing of interconnectedness and
that is why I&#39;m standing here and that&#39;s
why I&#39;m holding this dog you see I love
the earth and I care deeply about life
in all its diversity and it hurts very
deeply to see the destruction that we
humans caused on this planet I feel that
we urgently need to grow in our
understanding and also our experience of
participation of interbeing
and living accordingly to it only then I
feel we can create a future a
sustainable future for ourselves and for
all the life-forms that we share this
planet with may ask you whom of you is
optimistic about such a few
raise your hands please
they say I post this question to my
students every year after a course and
year after year I see the number of
hands decrease and when I then ask the
pessimists wider hole such bleak fuse
they usually say yeah you see I can try
to live sustainably and with respect for
the earth but what difference does that
make
in the light of the global economic
system the global financial system and
and the political system and we&#39;re over
the world has become so complicated that
I would not even know how to live
sustainably anymore what to buy what not
to buy what to eat what not to eat and
here I think we touch on another crisis
of our times a crisis that I find very
worrying that is the sense of
powerlessness many people feel that as
individuals they have no impact on the
future anymore but are we so powerless
you see if you understand participation
and interbeing
you see that we are connected to this
world in numerous ways and that in
everything we do in everything we say
now even would say in everything we
think we impact on the world around us
we are not without power and that point
was brought home vividly to me a few
years ago when I was at a conference
where a young couple approached me with
a little boy and I said may we introduce
our son to you that&#39;s of course and I
said this is Mateus I said yes that&#39;s a
nice name isn&#39;t it and then I said no no
he has been named after you I&#39;ve try a
little worried asked do I know you and I
said no no you do not know us but five
years ago you were at a meeting where
you cited a verse spoken by the Buddha
and at far as this may all beings be
happy and secure whether big or small
weak or strong born or yet striving to
be born may all beings be happy and
secure this young couple had just heard
that they were pregnant
and at the side they had decided not to
have the child because they felt too
young to become parents and when I heard
these words may all beings be happy and
secure born yet striving to be born that
looked into each other&#39;s eyes and at
that moment worthlessly decided to let
the child be born now this changed my
life because that&#39;s the moment I
realized what participation really means
what interbeing really means by simply
choosing a verse and citing it human
being was born that otherwise would not
have been there and had had not told me
I would never have known so we&#39;re not
without power we constantly touch the
world simply by being here but we very
often do not see how we touch the world
and of course no one of us will be able
to change individually the global
economic system or the global financial
system and the question even if even is
if it should be change or can be changed
there are emergent complex systems that
we cannot even unravel anymore but each
and every one of us can become a new
system by simply living a life from a
deep sense of connectedness of
participation we will form a resonance
that will affect everything and everyone
around us of course we will make
mistakes and of course we sometimes do
not know what to do that doesn&#39;t matter
the essence is the intention that
intention will create resonance that
will touch other people and when more
and more people start to resonate in
similar tones a new system will form and
will simply replace the old system
certain social scientists claim that
when 25 percent of society have changed
their worldview and act accordingly a
tipping point is reach a paradigm shift
will happen and society will change in
one big wave now I think it&#39;s safe to
say that we&#39;ve reached
ten or fifteen percents ten or 50
percent of our society are already
trying to live sustainably only ten
percents more needed now if each and
every one of us now tries to live from a
deep sense of connection to all life the
tipping point is reached in no time and
a wave will form let&#39;s start now
