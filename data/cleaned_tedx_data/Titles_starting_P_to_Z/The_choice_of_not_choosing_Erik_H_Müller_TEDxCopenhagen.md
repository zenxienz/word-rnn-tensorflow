so if you are like most people you have
a life that&#39;s full of repetitions and
ingrown habits you sleep in the same
side of the bed every night when you
wake up you sit on the same side of the
table you eat the same breakfast and
when you go to work and you want coffee
you go to the same coffee shop and you
order the same type of coffee as always
and when you come home in the evening
and you don&#39;t have time to cook you call
up your favorite pizza place and you
order the same pizza as always and if
you don&#39;t take care your life can easily
end up being run one long repetition day
in and day out
so today I&#39;ve come here to propose a
method that will help you avoid this by
changing how you make decisions so for
me it all started when I was living in
an apartment with a friend of mine and
we were not very good at cooking to be
honest
so we&#39;ve often we found ourselves
sitting with the pizza menu trying to
decide what to order and it was a tough
choice but in the end we always ended up
with the obvious choice the number 12
with chili and we did that a lot and one
day we decided we have to try something
completely new so we came up with a game
out there we call it pizza bingo and in
pizza bingo you call up a random pizza
place without looking in the menu and
then you say random numbers so you say
hello and either number 16 and can you
also make me a number 61 and then you
eat whatever you get and yeah when you
have to piece the menu it can actually
be quite difficult to find a pizza you
like when you buy pizza by random choice
you quite often get a pizza you don&#39;t
actually like
but the worst thing in pizza bingo is
not getting a bad pizza the worst thing
is getting a thing that&#39;s not a pizza
like the large bottle coca-cola or even
worse yeah this is the absolute disaster
this small mayonnaise so yeah we played
a lot of pizza bingo but you can&#39;t you
can&#39;t live from Pizza alone I tried and
it did not end well so in the end we
decided we have to get started cooking
so we took the cookbook but you have a
lot of choices you have 500 pages in the
cookbook so we couldn&#39;t figure out what
to to cook so we invented cookbook bingo
and in cookbook bingo you take a random
cookbook and you open a random page and
then you cook whatever is on that page
and we ended up having to cook a fairly
complicated dish of a chicken soup with
homemade coriander pasta and it took
more than three hours to cook and it
also we didn&#39;t have all the ingredients
so we had to go to the supermarket and
buy expensive ingredients that we never
used again so it also ended up being
extremely expensive and have a picture
of the dish here so as you can see I
mean even invited a friend over to
celebrate this huge success and as you
can see there&#39;s not enough food for
three people here so we were back at
ordering pizza
that&#39;s very same evening so yeah we gave
up on cookbook bingo but sometimes it&#39;s
also nice to go out and have a drink and
we always had the problem that we
couldn&#39;t choose what drinks to drink in
the bar so we invented drinks pinko and
in drinks bingo you say a random number
before you go into the path then you go
straight to the bartender you take the
menu and you count from the top you
might say number five and you say count
one two three four five and then you buy
whatever that number five is and you
always hope for the teen and tonic
automobile tow and for some strange
reason you always end up with a very
spicy margarita so the next big question
is where to go to have those drinks and
we always went to the same pass so we
thought
we have we can do better than this so we
came up with a concept that we call a
night on the town bingo where you go to
a random town for a night out so what we
did was that we took a magazine that we
had a couple of years ago in ten microts
called em I don&#39;t know if any of you can
remember it it was a very nice magazine
with pictures of girls in bikinis and
fast cars and also in this magazine
there was a description of a park fall
that the journalists had gone on in some
City so what we did
well if we found 11 or 12 editions of
this magazine and we took all the
magazines to the Central Station and met
up at 5 o&#39;clock 7 people and we found a
random guy and got him to throw the
dices of a picture of the situation here
we had a I must say we had quite quite
an audience at that point so we got
number 7 so we counted from the top
picked up magazine number 7 and in this
magazine there was a description of a
park roll in Odense it&#39;s better than the
one in Aarhus so we were a bit laggy
there but so we took the train to Orange
and went and the exact same park fall
and it was a great night out but it was
also a bit expensive because we had to
buy train tickets and we needed a nun we
had to go to all these bars and drink a
lot of drinks so in the end it took us
more than 12 hours before we came back
to Copenhagen but the good thing about
this drinks bingo trip was that it
sparked an idea for another concept we
have that we call travel pinko where we
travel to random places I know it
it has escalated a bit from Pizza to
were traveling to nowhere but yeah
written a Latia was just to go to the
airport in Copenhagen and then take a
plane to somewhere and then find out
what we&#39;re going to do when we arrived
but the problem we found out was that
you cannot buy a last-minute ticket or
you can&#39;t buy it but it&#39;s just extremely
expensive so we had to come up with a
different plan so what we did was that
we created a list of every place you can
travel to in this world
the list here it&#39;s it&#39;s fifteen hundred
and eighty-three
different places you can go so we have
four guys going on this trip and what we
do is we give this list to a fifth guy
who is not going so the fifth guy he&#39;ll
buy the flight tickets and then we&#39;ll
give them to us in the airport and as
you can see many of these places are far
away so we we created four rules so the
fifth guy when he&#39;s buying the ticket
he&#39;ll go down on the list actually first
we sent him a random number each and
then he puts together those numbers and
go down on the list to that number and
tries to buy a flight ticket to this
destination and we have created these
four rules that he will have to follow
so the city he ends up at breaks any of
these four rules you&#39;ll have to move on
to the next city so the first rule is we
can only go to new places so we can
never go to any place where any of us
has ever been before so we took out
London and Paris and Berlin I think that
was it then because we don&#39;t have
endless money so we have a budget we can
only pay 2,500 Danish Kroners for the
trip so we cannot go to South America
for a weekend trip another important
rule is we can only go south
that&#39;s no laughing matter it&#39;s mainly
because we simply can&#39;t afford to go to
Norway and then we have the fourth rule
just to make it extremely complicated we
can only carry hand luggage so we are
traveling with swim shorts and ski
underwear and we don&#39;t know where we&#39;re
going and we&#39;ve been doing this for a
few years actually we are meeting up
again next week on Thursday in the
airport and please don&#39;t ask me where
I&#39;m going because I have no idea yeah so
we&#39;ve been to Newcastle and we have been
to Kiev and we&#39;ve been to Istanbul and
Munich and Antwerp and been to Sicily
they have a lot of wine in Sicily now
they have much less wine in Sicily yeah
and when we go on these trips we of
course we do a lot of pinko activities
so one year we went Antwerp and we went
into a bar and they had 600 different
beers and we&#39;re going to play Pierre
pinko so and when you play pure pink
with 600 different beers you don&#39;t
actually have a list you have like a
telephone book of beer so here you have
to say a page number and then whatever
on that page you want to order and then
you order and drink it and it went
fairly well in the beginning so Casper
and I we got a fairly normal Belgian
beer nothing to write home about to its
head talked about but Peter on the other
hand he ended up with 300 grams of
cheese and a knife and a fork so within
the p.m. I knew they had a page just
with different types of cheeses but that
was not the worst
my poor friend andreas he got a Mahmood
bottle it was one and a half litre of 9%
Belgian beer so he had a very fun
evening but it was also a very short
evening so obviously when you meet up in
the airport and you have no idea where
you are going and you have never been
there before you also don&#39;t have a hotel
which is a bit of a risk to take but so
the our first thing in the airport is
always
to drink champagne and then try to
figure out where to sleep when we
arrived at the destination and when he
found out that we&#39;re going to Istanbul
and we took our smartphones and we
googled Istanbul and we found out there
was an area in Istanbul and it sounded
nice was described as a lily area with a
lot of young people and good nightlife
so we thought
good night life and young people that&#39;s
a good place for us to be so we booked
an apartment on the central square in
this neighborhood and we looked forward
to going to Istanbul and I must say they
have some crazy parties in Istanbul one
life we were in the streets and there
was a spontaneous street festival with a
lot of happy young people drumming and
things and yelling and have a picture
from that night here so in in 2013
travel pinko brought us to to Istanbul
and we rendered an apartment right on
Taksim Square the day that the gezi Park
riots started so as we say now embrace
uncertainty but bring your gas masks so
as you can understand these activities
are mostly for fun it&#39;s it&#39;s fun to
taste new things it&#39;s fun to drink spicy
drinks it&#39;s fun exactly a lot of fun to
watch your preference eat pizza with
goat cheese when you can see hates every
bite but there&#39;s also a larger
perspective to this many people always
choose the safe option they do whatever
they can to eliminate risks and
uncertainties in any activities they
participate in and I believe it&#39;s a
deep-rooted part of human nature to do
this but when you do this all the time
you also remove the joy of experiencing
the unexpected
take for example New Year&#39;s Eve many of
my friends they complain every year
about New Year&#39;s Eve if they say it&#39;s an
overrated party it&#39;s not as fun as is
too posed to be I was disappointed about
whatever and I believe that we
why people always complain about New
Year&#39;s Eve is because they planned too
much they have the perfect dinner set
they have the wined have some pain they
have the fireworks they even have a
playlist for the music all night and
then when the half they party they have
so high expectations that they end up
getting disappointed if you try to think
about the most fun night you have had
out or the most memorable the most
memorable episode on your last vacation
my guess is something happened that you
didn&#39;t plan maybe you you made some new
people
or maybe you planned for a quiet night
at the hotel but you ended up drinking
vodka with a homeless guy in the rain
and you were wearing a couple question
something happened that they made that
night fantastic and you didn&#39;t plan it I
have been doing this are these bingo
activities for a long time for small two
systems and for large decisions and
recently I used bingo for the biggest
decision of my life
now I&#39;m just kidding this this was
actually photoshopped so I like
surprises and random things and
experiencing things I didn&#39;t plan for
but I don&#39;t do bingo all the time I use
it selectively to add the spice of
insurgency to my life and it has brought
me a lot of fun and experiences I could
not have clamped and as you have heard
today when you get started with this it
can grow on you
and it can become a part of your life so
I tell you to bring bingo into your life
I dare you to sit on the other side of
the table I dare you to try a new coffee
I dare you to order a random pizza I
dare you to travel new places and meet
new people and when you do this may the
uncertainty be with you thanks
