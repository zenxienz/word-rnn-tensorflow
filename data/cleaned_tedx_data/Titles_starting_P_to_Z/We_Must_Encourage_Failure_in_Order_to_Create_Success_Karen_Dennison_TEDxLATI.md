thank you I love the theme it&#39;s your
world it&#39;s like it&#39;s your world it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of empowering right
it&#39;s your it&#39;s my world how do I do that
how does that did you guys read the fine
print my husband&#39;s a lawyer he always
makes me read the fine print I know the
fine print says in order to access that
world of yours in order to really
appreciate it you have to fail a lot of
people think that failure is the
opposite of success but it&#39;s not failure
our rungs on the ladder to success not
my rules sorry I didn&#39;t make them but
they&#39;re the rules I do career counseling
career coaching that means for me I work
with executives all around the world in
strategizing what they want to do with
their careers talking about problems
they&#39;re having challenges what they&#39;re
gonna do setting goals all of that good
stuff and I was at my desk one morning
and I got a call from one of my very
favorite clients hi Bill whoa screaming
he&#39;s screaming at me
I have no bench bill what are we talking
about apparently what we were talking
about was a job opening he had the
person he had been grooming for that
position she didn&#39;t want it the next
person in line had some medical issues
he couldn&#39;t take it
and now Bill&#39;s got nobody come on bill
you&#39;re a vice president in a fortune 50
multinational corporation you&#39;ve got
tens of thousands of people to choose
from it is not possible that not one of
those people can do this job the
screaming continues you&#39;re not listening
to me I&#39;ve got nobody when I was raising
my kids I had two main goals one was to
get them to 18 in one piece
that was iffy at times the second was to
get them with at least a plan about how
they were going to move out of my house
did I want them to be successful and
happy and productive yeah yeah yeah but
I wanted that to happen in their house
not in my house to accomplish that my
kids had to be able to be on Bill&#39;s
bench or somebody&#39;s bench they had to be
able to be plucked out of the crowd by
some manager executive boss who had the
faith that they could make decisions
that they could solve problems and they
could do a good job that required that
they be willing to fail I want you to
think about how success and failure and
and risk was dealt with in your life and
your growing up were you told to go out
and and make decisions and and suffer
the consequences of those decisions were
you encouraged to get up and try again
if you if you failed were you kind of
protected you know that looks too hard I
don&#39;t want you to feel bad I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t you know I want to protect you did
you thrive on participation trophies
most importantly how does all of that
affect how you deal with success and
failure and risk today and before you
start going to know my parents well it&#39;s
not just about about feeling bad
there&#39;s also safety issues and there&#39;s
how culturally we look at risk and
failure and success culturally how we&#39;ve
done that those attitudes have shrunk in
a very very small number of generations
an example of that is my husband&#39;s
generation my husband&#39;s uncle is a
pioneer in rock climbing if you have any
interested in rock climbing Google Mark
Powell rock climber he was amazing
he went to high school in Fresno which
is a city smack dab in the middle of
California 50 miles down in the valley
from Yosemite which is in the Sierra
Nevada mountains tallest mountain range
in the contiguous United States the
summer of Marc&#39;s fifteenth year he got
on his little bicycle and he rode it up
into Yosemite and he spent the summer
there rock climbing and I don&#39;t know
eating fish he caught whatever he did
lots of room for success lots of room
for failure one generation later my
generation we had to be in by the time
the street lights are on
there was no writing off tune to
anywhere for the summer for us street
lights came on we had to be home and
still there was a lot of autonomy I
started kindergarten at four and a half
years old I had to we live pretty close
to downtown Los Angeles and I had to
walk over a freeway and down and around
to get to school every day at 4 and a
half by myself less autonomy then uncle
Marc but more than today today a couple
had the police and Social Child
Protective Services called on them
because they&#39;re 9 and 10 year old sons
walked a block and a half alone to the
park culturally we have much much less
tolerance for any kind of risk at all
psychologists will tell us that in our
little brains failure the prospect of
failure equals the prospect of death
kind of makes sense you&#39;re you&#39;re a
caveman and you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re
hunting a saber-toothed tiger and you go
out and you let that spear fly and it
misses not a pretty sight and even
though that&#39;s not the life that we live
today our brains still go if we fail we
could die
so if failure equals death and
culturally we&#39;re saying better safe and
sorry you&#39;ve all heard that rights
better safe than sorry and frankly
failure doesn&#39;t feel good doesn&#39;t it&#39;s
not pleasant it&#39;s kind of scary it&#39;s
uncomfortable if all of that is true why
am i standing up here saying go out and
bail bail
well the first casualty of not being
willing to fail is innovation and
creativity and I&#39;m not even talking
about Steve Jobs kind of creativity
although he was a master at being
willing to fail I&#39;m talking about a new
and different world that offers us
different kinds of challenges every
single day and if we are not if we&#39;re
not approaching those within creative
innovative solutions solutions that may
work may not work if we&#39;re not doing
that we&#39;re failing by default the second
thing is personal development if you&#39;re
not pushing that edge of what you can do
someplace work that might not work out
if you&#39;re not pushing that then you&#39;re
not growing my daughter came home from
my oldest came home from first grade and
she was a bit of an overachiever and she
comes home with the paper chefs at my
facebook I missed - that&#39;s awesome not
awesome I was going to go complain if
you&#39;re never missing any if you&#39;re never
getting any wrong it&#39;s too easy they&#39;re
not pushing you they&#39;re not challenging
you I don&#39;t want it to be too easy I
want you to struggle a little bit I want
you to work getting better my first talk
up in front of people it was a disaster
it was a terrible failure I was 13 it
was in front of my whole junior high
did I die I wanted to my parents
wouldn&#39;t let me drop out of school they
made me go back the next day you know
what happened to me nobody cared I mean
a couple of my friends went at but
really nobody cared I went Wow look at
that I could go over all the things I
did right well I&#39;d spent the whole night
before going over all the things I did
wrong what I did right what I could
change what I could do better next next
time next time next time I&#39;m one day I
could do a TEDx talk right next time in
a weird kind of counterintuitive way
failure creates a little bit of
self-confidence
okay picture I&#39;m in I&#39;m playing
basketball I&#39;m in the NBA Finals I&#39;m not
not school astray I&#39;m in the a bit five
right I&#39;m out there on the floor
and the clock is ticking down five four
three two and my team is down by two
points and I&#39;m looking over at that guy
with the ball I&#39;m going please pass that
ball to somebody else because I don&#39;t
know how to do this I haven&#39;t trained my
mind about this okay I I just got up for
soda I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m doing
out here it&#39;s like one of those weird
dreams where you didn&#39;t put all your
clothes on that&#39;s like I I have no idea
what I&#39;m doing here but the real
basketball players they&#39;ve taken that
shot a thousand times they&#39;ve made it a
bunch of times they&#39;ve missed it a bunch
of times and they know that success or
failure tomorrow they&#39;re back in the gym
trying to get better they know what the
consequences are consequences is a big
key to this whole thing I was talking to
a vice president of a major corporation
when you all know the name of and she
had to call in one of her subordinates
she had it she had to chew him out and
this isn&#39;t at a mail room level this is
in the executive suite she calls him in
and she says this is what you did wrong
this is how we&#39;re gonna fix it these are
the consequences we&#39;re gonna have to
suffer and this is how we&#39;re gonna make
sure you never do this again it was not
a career-ending mistake but it was a
serious conversation
the next day his mom called to discuss
it with her now
I don&#39;t know how many about out there
are going yeah my mom she&#39;s like how
many moms they&#39;re saying darn straight I
call let me explain to you all the
mistake was not career-ending the phone
call the phone call put his name on the
list in permanent marker this guy will
never go anywhere in this company
because they don&#39;t believe he can deal
with consequences because they don&#39;t
have the faith that he can make
decisions that he can solve problems
without having to hold his mommy&#39;s hand
so how do we do this how do we train our
brains how do we train them that goes
you know I&#39;m not gonna die this isn&#39;t
this isn&#39;t terminal
unfortunately Facebook memes don&#39;t work
it would be nice if they do you&#39;ve all
seen them right Abraham Lincoln lost
eight elections and failed in two
businesses before he was elected
president Babe Ruth
Babe Ruth was a strikeout King in
baseball on his way to breaking the
homerun record and our brains love that
because those are that&#39;s so motivating
that feels so good they failed they
tried again they succeeded that look at
how awesome they are um but if I fail
I&#39;m gonna die it&#39;s about teaching them
it&#39;s about teaching your brain how to do
it how do you start goals you set your
goal out further than what you think
you&#39;re capable of that space that&#39;s bass
in the middle that&#39;s the magic space
that&#39;s where all the successes all the
failures all the growth that&#39;s where
that happens you set your goal up
further and then you get better and you
set your Co out further and then you get
better if my goal is to get up brush my
teeth and make a pot of tea I&#39;m not
getting better I&#39;m not doing anything
it&#39;s living in that magic space it&#39;s
taking the two dues of that goal how do
I reach that goal these are the steps
it&#39;s taking the scary one do the scary
one first do the scary things Mark Twain
said if you eat a frog first thing in
the morning everything for the rest of
the day is pleasant do the scary thing
and either you have to spend the rest of
day cleaning it up or you get to do the
easy stuff either way you&#39;re getting
better I learned to do this when I was
launching a membership website
I had lessons and I had videos and I had
resources and my business coach came to
me and she said when are you gonna push
go when are you gonna launch it so well
it&#39;s not good enough yet I need more
lessons and more videos and and she came
back and she said well okay so now when
you launch it go it&#39;s not going to stop
stop when is it going to be good enough
never never because it was never about
the website was it it was about me me
fearing to fail and the minute I
recognized that I knew I had to do the
scary thing I had to push go and then I
had to spend my my time cleaning up the
problems and celebrating the successes
and getting better getting better and
living with the consequences I told you
consequences is the key if somebody if
you make a mistake and somebody else
cleans it up every time what you&#39;re
teaching your brain is somebody else
will clean it up I didn&#39;t die cuz
they&#39;re gonna fix it not I didn&#39;t die
because it&#39;s not terminal and I can fix
it I can do it those are your
consequences
don&#39;t let anybody take them away from
you you warned them
you deserved them keep them work with
them get better it is all encapsulated
in learning how to ride a bicycle
remember you&#39;re you&#39;re up there and
you&#39;re imbalanced and and you can&#39;t
quite do it and and your parent your
parents running behind and they&#39;re
holding on and then they let go
hopefully they let go they let go and
you&#39;re going I can
[Music]
I got this I can do this right and then
and then what they do they yelled stop
stop stop
I&#39;ve waited stop I didn&#39;t stop no no
buddy don&#39;t stop like the first time
they let go how did you stop maybe
there&#39;s some tears maybe there&#39;s some
blood let&#39;s say something terrible
happened and you actually broke your arm
well you got a cast that was kind of
cool but he got better right and the
next time you got up there you might
okay I got to figure out this stop thing
because I want to do that again and I
got the good go thing and I&#39;m I got a
guy pretty soon like conquered the
bicycle monster plus you got the added
benefit of being able to go with friends
like later on in life and say you know
when I learned how to bite ride a
bicycle hahaha I broke my arm like
wouldn&#39;t you rather have that story then
my mommy called my boss what happened
with Bill and his job he hired someone
he hired someone who actually been taken
off of the contention list because he&#39;d
made some mistakes guy was really smart
did a good job but you know he didn&#39;t
messed up some stuff and bill took a
chance on him and he&#39;s doing a fabulous
job
I said bill keep encouraging him to fail
Koen oh but Secretary of State Colin
Powell said there is no secret to
success it&#39;s hard work it&#39;s perseverance
and it&#39;s learning from failure the
wonderful people organizers here
ask me how this idea fits in with the
whole theme of it&#39;s your world and my
response is it&#39;s only your world if you
stand up there and risk creating it
otherwise it&#39;s someone else&#39;s world
imposed upon you my encouragement for
you is that you never ever ever stop
failing thank you
you
[Applause]
