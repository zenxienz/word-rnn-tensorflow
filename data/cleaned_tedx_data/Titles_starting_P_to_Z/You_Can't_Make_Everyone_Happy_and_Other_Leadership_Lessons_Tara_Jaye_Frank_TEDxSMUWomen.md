bridges I&#39;m willing to bet that most of
you walked through that door today with
a looming thought about the space
between where you are and where you
aspire to be
you may be wondering if you should be
moving faster or slower in a more direct
line alone or with someone else some of
you may even be wondering if you need to
go back that way
just a little bit but we all have that
experience I&#39;m going to tell you my
story today of crossing a bridge from
plans to purpose and I hope you hear
something you really needed to hear I
knew early in my career that I wanted to
lead I did not know exactly what that
meant so I did what anyone who wants to
do something but doesn&#39;t know how to do
it did and I started looking for the
formula I started watching the leaders
who were around me watching how they
walked how they talked how they
interacted what other people said to
them how folks responded to them and I
started trying to model that because I
wanted to lead right and they were
working it out they were doing it didn&#39;t
take me long to realize that other
people&#39;s winning formulas for leadership
were not going to work for me I could be
inspired by them I could be informed by
them but I could never be them the good
news is I also realized that they could
never be me and so I made it my business
relatively early on to understand what
it is that differentiated me as a person
as a woman as a leader and once I
discovered it I really started to use it
actively to propel myself forward
early in our careers we do want to grow
right we want to advance we want to have
a bigger impact we want to do more I
know a story of a young woman and I
wrote about it in my book who really
wanted to get promoted and so she kept
telling her boss I want to advance I
want to be promoted I want to be
promoted well the issue for him was none
of his peers really knew anything about
her
they couldn&#39;t vouch for her right they
couldn&#39;t say she&#39;s really good at this
or she needs to develop here and so she
had essentially no visibility and no
proof points behind her ability to lead
and so he saw an opportunity for her to
get that visibility and get that
experience and came back to her and said
I have this opportunity for you to lead
this project it&#39;s really important work
we&#39;re not quite sure how to get it done
and we think if you can get in there and
solve this problem people will see you
they&#39;ll come to understand who you are
and what you can do and good things will
happen and she essentially said I&#39;m not
going to do more work without the pay
and the position this is where you sigh
like oh my god she really said that
because she really said that you can
imagine not much happen for her after
that right within two years she was gone
from the company I always tell people in
coaching sessions etc that we don&#39;t get
promoted by being good at what we do we
don&#39;t get promoted by performing our
jobs really well we get promoted by
demonstrating the potential to do more
and so each of us has an opportunity to
lead from where we are as I started to
grow in my own career I realize that
success for me anyway
had very little to do with pay and
position in everything to do with
alignment and when I say alignment for
me that means the alignment of values
the alignment of your beliefs and also
the alignment of your expectations when
folks come to me and they say I really
want to be in the c-suite or I really
want to be a CEO my first question is
usually why what kind of experience do
you want to have what skills do you want
to use what skills do you want to learn
and most important what value do you
want to contribute the more we
understand about the experience we want
to have and working in life and the more
specific we can be about that experience
the better equipped we are to align
ourselves and our place with the right
time and the right space and so here I
am you know at my company doing my thing
and I get promoted to executive
management at 30 and I get an executive
coach because that&#39;s what you do when
you get promoted to executive management
you&#39;d get an executive coach and she
asked me within two weeks of being named
to the position what my purpose was in
that position and so I tell her well you
know I&#39;m here to drive the business and
develop the talents and she cut me off
she said no I&#39;m not asking you about
your job description I&#39;m not asking you
about your objectives I&#39;m asking you
about your purpose and I was perplexed I
will not lie to you I was perplexed
because I had reserved the notion of
purpose for much heavier things like
disease and poverty and children I never
thought about purpose in the context of
my work and so I went away and I thought
about it and I did land on a purpose at
this time I led an organization of a few
hundred people and they were really
important to the company at least I
believed so but they weren&#39;t always
being leveraged as fully as they
possibly could so I decided that I
wanted to transform that group from a
bunch of people who took you know put
words on things right to say it simply
to folks who were thought leaders and
idea generators and people who would be
brought into the fold early on in the
product development process instead of
consulted up at the end of it and the
beautiful thing that happened was
everything I did as a leader grew out of
that purpose from that point on my
strategy grew out of that purpose my
talent development practices grew out of
that purpose in the relationship and the
overall energy of the group grew out of
that purpose and it did so in an
accelerated timeframe
so here&#39;s where I got my first hard
lesson yeah right
my first hard lesson because I learned
right around this time that not everyone
was gonna like me I know you none of you
have learned this yet it was really
difficult especially I think as a woman
because we value our relationships we
want to deepen our connections we want
to broaden our circles we want people to
not only respect us but to care about us
right to like who we are and what we do
and I realize that the higher the rank
the heart of the decisions and the
harder the decisions the harder the
feelings right that go along with some
of those decisions and so this was a
difficult lesson for me I wanted to be a
thought leader I wanted to shift
paradigms and I recognized that doing
that was going to make some people
uncomfortable and not only uncomfortable
it would make some people very unhappy
I&#39;m glad I learned it then I&#39;ve had lots
of opportunities for it to be
reconfirmed over the last several years
so that was the first hard lesson but
the first major lesson for me over the
course of my entire career was this one
that your purpose is not confined to
time or space you are transcendent and
so I want to tell you a little bit of a
story about how I learned this point in
my career I was ascending to the c-suite
I was in the succession plan to become a
corporate officer had been working
toward that for about six or seven years
this stretch opportunity right these
relationships this skill building
exercise and the unexpected happened I
fell in love again at this time I know I
was living in Kansas City with three
young children and single mom in it
doing my thing working it out and I fell
in love and so that sounds like there&#39;s
you&#39;re like what&#39;s that&#39;s awesome what&#39;s
what are you stressing about but I was
an executive and he was an executive I
was the breadwinner and he was a
breadwinner and I was in Kansas City and
he was
not in Kansas City here was in Dallas
and so I recognized through for lots of
reasons that the most logical thing to
do was to move here to Dallas
with those three children and start a
new life and so you can imagine that for
someone who had a plan someone who told
you early in my career I knew I wanted
to lead that this was a major right
point of transformation for me but I had
to reconcile the fact that my purpose
right which was to advance other
people&#39;s professional purposes my
purpose was not dead it simply needed a
new body it needed a new way to come to
life and I realized that my job at that
point in time was to find it a new body
and if I couldn&#39;t find one I had to
create one and so I set off and started
to do my own work the first year of
being on my own and doing my own work I
adopted what I like to call a generosity
strategy so I decided upfront before I
even did anything that I was just going
to give it away and that it took many
forms if people wanted to talk to me on
the phone and get some advice I would
talk to them on the phone if they wanted
me to speak to their class I would speak
to their class if they wanted me to talk
to their leaders at their office I would
go and talk to the leaders at their
office right if they wanted to meet me
for coffee I would have coffee I would
do all of this and I decided I would do
it without any consideration for what I
might get in return some of you think
I&#39;m crazy but I believed wholeheartedly
that this generosity strategy would
return to me greater than I could ever
imagine and God knows it did everything
amplified for me after that first year
my relationships were elevated my skills
were refined right my contribution was
heightened everything got better because
when I gave I got back more than I could
possibly imagine
and so one of those visits to a company
when I was speaking to about 200 women I
had a young lady come up to me
afterwards and she was about five years
into her career and she said you know I
heard you say you just wrote a book and
I&#39;ve been wanting to write you know ever
since I was little but I really need
this job I can&#39;t quit my job because I
you know have bills etc etc but I really
want to write that&#39;s what I want to do
and she said I don&#39;t know what to do
with that what should I do and I said
you should write you should write who
says you have to quit your job to write
you can write at night you can write in
the morning you can write on the
weekends you can write on your lunch
break writing does not require you to
completely leave one thing in order to
do another I said so right and don&#39;t
tell people that you want to be a writer
be a writer go do what you can&#39;t not do
we all have a can&#39;t not I knew the
things that we&#39;re pulling at me and had
been pulling at me for years
and I could not escape them go do what
you can&#39;t not do and so the deeper I got
into women&#39;s leadership and development
I started to kind of see a couple of the
warts right there are some warts like
maybe two or three and one of them is
around this whole notion of women
competing with other women and so I
started to kind of hear about this queen
bee thing right I don&#39;t know how many of
you have heard about the queen bee
syndrome but somebody makes it to the
top and then holds everybody else at
arm&#39;s length because I had to work
really hard to get here and so should
you
I do not get it I don&#39;t get it
at all not one of us is diminished by
investing in other women in fact we can
only be enriched and so I tell people
set your own high bar we&#39;re not in
competition with each other I also
realized that all this work doing I was
doing to develop women leaders
individual that women leaders was great
and awesome but I was releasing them
back into these climates right these
corporate environments that weren&#39;t
always healthy it was like playing
a healthy tree in unhealthy soil and it
really started to bug me because I never
set out to change corporate culture
right I set out to help women advance
and do their thing but I realized that
my vision for doing that had started to
expand beyond my purview it got bigger
than I planned for it to get and it got
bigger faster than I planned for it to
get because I knew that this was
important that culture is the soil in
which strategies thrive or die and it&#39;s
also the soil in which people can thrive
or professionally die and so I had to
step out and step up and I started a
firm and president and CEO of that firm
because why not why wouldn&#39;t I be and
really started a firm to help companies
right create corporate cultures where
people can win where they can thrive
where they can grow where they can be
happy and do what it is they&#39;re uniquely
equipped to do sometimes the need in the
world pulls at you before you&#39;re ready
sometimes it pulls at you before you&#39;re
ready but you&#39;ve got to go there&#39;s way
too much work to do and lastly I just
want to share and implore each of you to
write your own leadership story when we
don&#39;t someone else will write it for us
that I guarantee you they will get it
wrong and not only will they write it
for you they will tell other people your
story the wrong one not the story you
want told write your own story right
with your pen and your dreams and your
abilities and I guarantee you if you do
that and if you tell it often enough and
if you live it boldly you will turn
around one day to realize that is no
longer a story it is your life thank you
so much
[Applause]
