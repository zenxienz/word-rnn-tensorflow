hi everyone first I just want to say
thank you all for coming out and sharing
your Sunday with us it means a lot and
we really appreciate it
so we know that being involved in your
community is pretty important and it can
have a significant impact in the world
around you we know that small businesses
help to support economic growth and we
know that including adults into youth
programs helps to have better adolescent
outcomes and we know that incorporating
accessible Fitness leads to better so
I&#39;m sorry more access to physical
activity promotes physical activity and
leads to healthier lifestyles but what I
think we often forget when we talk about
being involved in in a community is the
are the experiences of the individual
person and that make up the group in the
community so what I want to talk about
today are some of my individual
experiences and how I kind of use some
of those to get involved in the
community that I live in so as I thought
about what I wanted to talk about today
I was pretty uncomfortable sometimes
doing an event like this can be a little
nerve-racking because there&#39;s lots of
you and we want to make sure that our
voices are heard and heard well but as I
thought about when I wanted to talk
about today it kept returning to this
one idea and I didn&#39;t want this to be
one talk about one thing and I kept
meeting roadblock after roadblock after
roadblock and I realized I just needed
to call it what it was I needed to tell
myself and be okay with the fact that
this is a talk about race and this is
going to be a talk about how the issues
that we have in America impede
individuals ability to get involved with
their own community and I understand
there&#39;s a lot of angst about this topic
it&#39;s pretty uncomfortable to talk about
it was uncomfortable for me to think
about
because I grew up in the world where
this really didn&#39;t matter but I&#39;m shown
day after day that it still continues to
matter and but I know that even if this
issue doesn&#39;t affect you guys the same
way that it affects me maybe this isn&#39;t
a cause that you have to champion
because it is too painful or it&#39;s pretty
uncomfortable but I hope that you&#39;ll
find what I have to say helpful in your
own face-to-face confrontation and the
adversity that you faced in your life
because we&#39;ve all had our own so a
couple of weeks ago I was traveling and
when I got off the plane I my phone was
like blowing up with notifications and I
wasn&#39;t quite sure what this you know you
kind of think you know these people are
texting me I just got off of a flight
and everyone wants to see how it was it
was mostly news notifications and this
was unfortunately about the event that
occurred in Charlottesville and as I let
it sink in and as I settled where I was
going
it kind of really hit me that when some
of a man drove his car into a crowd of
people who were protesting peacefully
the mistreatment of of other people in
their community that was really hard to
let sink in and so as I thought about it
I thought about how my life was affected
by this and how the life of the people
in my family is affected by this but
also how my community is affected by
this and even though we know it&#39;s pretty
difficult to talk about I do know that
for me when certain events like this
occur I start to think about what I can
do to steward change and so I have these
ideas of you know just like setting up
these plans of action of how I&#39;m gonna
shift and change the world around me and
by the end of these thoughts I have a
whole plan of world peace you know and
then
I come back to reality and it&#39;s like
wait here we are we&#39;re still in this
place and it&#39;s really painful to be in
this place and react so I started to
think about how do I create a world
where the generations after me and our
current generation can create a culture
that responds with compassion respects
diversity and honors individuality and
so I started to think about this and as
I thought you know I still had some more
of those thoughts you know like I&#39;m
gonna finish this thought and have a
whole plan of how I can change
everything and then it really hit me I
wasn&#39;t quite comfortable with myself and
I couldn&#39;t really move out of this place
because I wasn&#39;t comfortable with who I
was because I have been held back a lot
by plenty of adversities which life is
about overcoming them but also because
we live in a world in a culture that
does not allow us to connect with one
another because of the barriers that we
allow to socially and culturally
influenced our lives so my mother is
Puerto Rican my dad is black and white
and my whole life growing up I remember
filling out standardized forms and
having to choose one race and that was
really hard for me because I grew up
where it was okay to be three different
races and it was okay to express
yourself in three different ways but on
paper I had to choose one and I was
never really capable of doing that
because it&#39;s not who I am and I often
wonder did other kids have to do this
were they just as frustrated as I was
did they come home and tell their moms
that they had to do this and they didn&#39;t
know what to do and I kind of still
faced some of those assumptions as an
adult today if my hair my hair is really
curly naturally and so I&#39;ll hear if when
my hair is really curly oh my goodness
you really are part black or if I&#39;m
wearing hoop earrings
you do look Porto Rican today or then
when I speak you sound really white as
if somehow we&#39;ve learned
to attribute these characteristics to
someone&#39;s sole identity and this is an
uncomfortable conversation it&#39;s an
uncomfortable talk but what makes me
even more uncomfortable is that this is
2017 and just two weeks ago I was asked
what my ethnic background was before I
was asked my name and I answered the
question with a smile because I&#39;m used
to answering the question as if it&#39;s
just as important as the name my parents
gave me when I was born and so going
back to thinking about some of these
things I consider the generations that
come after us there is no child in my
family that&#39;s ever going to be one race
so this is really important to me and
the Pew Research Center did a study well
not really a study they just collected
some demographic information and they
realized they found that about seven
percent of adults identify as being
multiracial the percentage of children
multiracial children has grown from 8%
since the 1970s and then even more
importantly the amount of multiracial
children or I&#39;m sorry the amount of
multiracial Americans under 18 is about
46% so children under 18 make up about
46% of the multiracial people group in
our country and so for me this is really
important that we work hard to create a
world in a culture that kind of fosters
some of these aspects of individuality
and acceptance because without doing
that we really hinder everyone&#39;s
individual ability to be involved and to
make movements to change their own
community and so I&#39;m not really here to
tell you what to do or tell you what to
think but I hope that some of these
things the way that I&#39;ve handled this
can help you confront some of the
adversity that you&#39;ve faced so one of
the ways that I really do this is I dig
deep into some of these issues so if I
find that I really want you know I&#39;m in
my head I&#39;m thinking of this world peace
cure that I can have for why we
really except everyone and when I
realized that I had a hard time doing
this because I couldn&#39;t accept my own
self or I had a hard time with the
expectations for myself I took a step
back and I think that&#39;s the best thing
that we can really do is take a step
back and understand why is this
bothering you and why is it painful
usually if something&#39;s pretty painful
that&#39;s where you really need to start I
found and you begin to navigate your
story and navigate the story of other
peoples with empathy and looking in and
with that you&#39;re able to tell your story
in a different way so you&#39;re able to
tell these stories of adversity that
you&#39;ve faced in a different way so
instead of allowing this to be a story
of disaster where I walk down the street
and all people care about is what my
ethnic background is I don&#39;t believe
that I think in context you people
usually have a pretty good intention but
I do know that I could choose to tell
this story in two ways one that is a
complete disaster and another that
creates an absolute masterpiece and it&#39;s
all in the story that you choose to tell
we all have some pretty defining moments
of adversity and I think the best way to
get through these are to build pretty
positive relationships with people so I
make it a point to develop and foster
important relationships in my life with
my family with the people that I work
with and in in plenty of areas so I
encourage you guys if to face your
adversity through that way and then
secondly I encourage you to get involved
you don&#39;t have to really be at a certain
place in your life or be in a certain
state or really you know because I still
struggle with some of these boxes that I
meant to fit in and I think I might for
the rest of my life it might just meet
me at different levels and that&#39;s okay
I&#39;m up for the challenge but I think
that one of the most important things we
can do is to still while we&#39;re working
in that use use some of these aspects as
muscle to build into what we&#39;re doing in
our lives and when
with people so I really have the
privilege of being able to do that in
the area by working with Ashley who&#39;s
here who runs a fitness company and we
work to promote exercise and physical
activity and have accessible fitness
programs for the community and whatever
that you choose to do whatever way that
this fits in your life whatever
adversities you have faced I hope that
you&#39;re able to turn them around and use
them as a story that builds to create a
positive community and a positive
culture that not only embraces your
adversity but also the questioning and
experiences of other people so that you
can do what you can with what you have
where you are thank you
[Applause]
