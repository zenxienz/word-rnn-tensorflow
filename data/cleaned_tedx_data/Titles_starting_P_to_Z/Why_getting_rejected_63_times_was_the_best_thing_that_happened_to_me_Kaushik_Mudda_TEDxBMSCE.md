my name is started today Spain
I wanna start off my speech by showing
you these two particular grid cuts of a
high school student quite spotless
record isn&#39;t it his classmates this
particular students classmates his
teachers his family members extended
family everybody thought that him to get
into one of the premier Institute&#39;s of
the country we love the medicine science
methods anything but when the banking
fortunately or unfortunately he couldn&#39;t
get into one of these static speakers
and that&#39;s when going around from family
mousou from his classmates saying
something must have gone wrong and more
than anything came to fight him judgment
saying his career school if you want to
lose report card this is none of those
who&#39;s the government&#39;s which was flowing
around ever affected me in the body at
the same time there was one particular
code which I came across which left a
deep impression on me since the test of
our progress is not whether we add more
to the abundance of those who have much
it was whether we provide energy for
those who have too little cooled by
fraxinus be those well this got me
thinking a lot and if this particular
cult was combined with the statistic
that I came across would say only 47 out
of 100 children enrolled and last one
reach class eight in India I&#39;ve managed
a very decent education and still
because I those qualities what about
these people what about the lives of
other Indians who would never really
make it to any particular college at all
so the first time I ever stumbled they
give me a purpose that I want to work
for the common man I want to work for
the Pharaoh
India and that&#39;s exactly what I want
what I&#39;m going to be doing but you know
India at that point in time how I&#39;m
gonna do it so what is essentially doing
was I started saving up money I had
something called issus an ETF on the
commercial development fund a small
pouch every time I will see him five
hundred and a thousand rupee note and my
wallet it would automatically disappear
and find its way into that charge and
over there when they die clearly that I
had to invest in an idea I invested him
an idea for which I had always wanted to
move in a direction in two words I go
from the adhesion machines with my
classmate Doug Naveen Jane I mistook my
time I understood my efforts I invested
my saved up money from a low tolerance
prize money which I connected all of
that went into a mail machines so what
do we do we make cnc routers so what
these machines do is basically you can
provide a little design to a computer it
will be anything
implement then design on for you on
marble granite any particular material
you can receive my machine so what my
client is do is they buy my machine and
they start businesses in different
verticals so tomorrow when you build
your own house and you want to name
plate with your with your name and your
family&#39;s name printed on it so you can
go to one of my clients and he will put
in the marble piece inscribe out the
name and give you that particular piece
which you can fix at your house so what
we are doing is they&#39;re creating to tell
us so my clients settle businesses so we
are setting up and sustainable living
for our clients only and only by the
virtue of having this one particular
machine but nothing is as lucy has it
seen right so once we had the prototype
we started approaching the market I was
rejected quite a few times I was tuned
away from home
quite a few number of times number of
reasons because I was young I started
this when I was in my final year so
because I was young because I hadn&#39;t
graduated yet because we lack experience
and making technical products of such
high precision umpteen number of reasons
that&#39;s also one of the reasons why I
keep on Vietnam because my clients take
up older than I am right now that&#39;s one
reason I can&#39;t look good so I stumbled a
lot many times but you don&#39;t something
kept me going and every time I was out
of a particular office and I would
insist that office and this is how I
will be I will be back this is exactly
my expression and any never then I never
meant that make me feel bad at all so
that&#39;s how I used to take each of these
rejections at this juncture I would like
to talk to you about one particular
rejection that I faced so engineering
college will Bank know they wanted to
purchase a CNC router so that they
students can make prototypes of the
products they wanted to tender so they
wanted receives in outer so that so that
they can cut out position parts and then
put it together and make it a fully
develop product so the Secretary of the
College of the principal of the college
called me over to their campus and said
please give a presentation and if we
like it then we 100 purchase your
machine I said so I went down to the
college job give the presentation the
Secretary was making impressed he said
mr. Buddha they were gonna buy a machine
and I still had it netted my first order
at that point in time I said well
brilliant so he was overjoyed
we started jumping so the secretary said
why don&#39;t we meet all next week an same
time I said all right let&#39;s do that so I
went back I prepared all the nose tickle
documents and the invoices and the
Confucians of the blueprints and the
next week I showed up at college again
with the file I stood at the door with
the Secretary&#39;s room and I know I said
my coming so he looks at me and says hi
you said well I met you last week so he
said what if I said C&amp;C adoptive I give
you a presentation I had lunch with you
in this room he said oh we&#39;ve changed
our mind we don&#39;t want the much anymore
get out I wasn&#39;t even in the room to get
out I was at the entrance and I was
shown the door right there this is the
point where you realize that rejections
stumbling is like fire
what is the first idea or the first
reaction of yours or anybody when you
see a fire you&#39;re afraid you feel it
fire is moving to destruct but in the
same time fire is needed to melt or
metal and mold it into something
distinctive rejections of very similar
it can because you deep amount of hood
if you think about it think about the
last time you fell off stairs or you
have some bruises on your hand you would
never be able to relive that degree of
pain but if you think about the last
time you were rejected you will be able
to relive that pain to a certain extent
because you know the emotions you went
to and you might end up feeling balanced
way because that&#39;s the characteristics
of being rejected by something but I
mean it&#39;s up to you you can let the fire
leave scars on you you can let the
finally burn marks on you or what you
can do is you can let the fire mold you
into someone who does not bother about
the rejections of mourning reduce
someone who&#39;s quite unique in
completely different shape than itself
so when I walked out of that room after
that particular rejection I used to have
an ID with each client&#39;s name and phone
number and details with one client per
page I got all I waited till exit of the
college sat across went and sat on the
footpath open up my daddy told the page
of this particular flight crumbled the
beat and flung it as far as I could and
the next minute I could not my phone
turn the page died in the number of the
next client so that I don&#39;t seek an
appointment again that&#39;s how we went
about selling our machines so after 63
rejections I managed to make my first
order my first order with my machine was
going all the way across the country to
Punjab so we worked day and night for
this and we built the machine we packed
it up with that kind of clay and this is
a picture from the logistical from the
logistics company so this is right
before it was being loaded into the
truck and it was going there as it was
to be set up a job six months of working
hard
pursuing clients three months of getting
rejected again and again and two months
of building the first machine and he
finally enact this so once I reach
Punjab I went with my client
and I was waiting for the truck goes to
open so that I can see my machine there
as I could feel happy about it and this
is what I saw the crate was no sense
there was a thousand of materials on my
machine the sides were broken
the bed was damaged the accuracy was
completely compromised the next morning
the client was inaugurating his shop he
was performing the function

at 6:30 so this is some better not might
be up and I saw it I was extremely angry
my eyes were ready the Beatles on the
verge of tears
I tried shouting at the person of the
companies that sell I don&#39;t do anything
I&#39;m just hitting you right into any
knowledge to this I said there&#39;s no
point arguing in this so we took back

the machine to the plants place 10:30 we
instead take 32 539 and I work in
version we did not stop we corrected the
entire machine overnight so that they
could perform that in operate their
workshop the next morning so what we of
course the paint was compromised whether
something we took care of later so the
next time I was dispatching a machine
all right no I wouldn&#39;t wanna close the
company and I&#39;d say the last time I was
sending a machine this happened with me
to get this repeated said don&#39;t worry so
we have the most foolproof mechanism I
think I should give it to it so he said
so I&#39;ll be back in a moment
where&#39;s your crate I said yeah that&#39;s my
tree table that you can have a look at
it okay so he goes and said I thought is
gonna bring in the next photos what who
convinced me that you know my package is
safe over there
but in turn he walks up with a marker
walks up to my Creed and right
ex-army looks at me and he says that
nobody&#39;s gonna mess with the people who
have guns
I said you did it but it won&#39;t so that&#39;s
how my second book later my machines
were being dispatched that&#39;s now in my
co-founder
very decent picture so eventually we
grew in size we grew from a to me please
from top of 4,000 square-foot workshop
now we have a team of engineers who
helped us in building the machine but
you know what I love most about the work
we do the kind of entrepreneurship will
be helps my clients to gain a new
recognition some of my clients are from
marginalized sections of the society
people from marginalized sections feel
the pinch when society denies them of
opportunities at places of interaction
such as work or such as educational
institution entrepreneurship helps them
greatly from these chains where they
don&#39;t have to depend on anyone else and
they can clean what&#39;s theirs by break
away from the chains of oppression and
discrimination by making their own
opportunities of making their own
destiny so that&#39;s how entrepreneurship
helps these kinds of people and that&#39;s
why unlike my machines have been able to
help people do that so the next time you
stumble promised yourselves the Houston
you dust yourselves off and will not
treat it as anything more than a
momentary tumble and you&#39;re gonna take
it head-on and you will never feel bad
about it
very recently a new member joined us on
board and exterior machines and the new
member ensures that the work level of
the candid on a walk is that a conducive
level all the time and shows that the
mood is always uplifted at our workplace
and is a huge and a very vital part of
my phone Cillian machines right now I&#39;d
like to sign off by showing you a
picture of this new member with us and
the entire team thank you for having me
here keep stumbling and keep learning
