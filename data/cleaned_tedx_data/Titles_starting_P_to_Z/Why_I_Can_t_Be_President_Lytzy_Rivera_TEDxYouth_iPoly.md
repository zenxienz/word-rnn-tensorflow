hello everybody hi my name is Lucy
Rivera and I am currently a junior here
at high poly high school so the other
day I had a conversation with a parent
at a school event a mom I had never met
before see I was so excited to tell her
about my life story and what I want to
do with my life
it was later relate to me that she said
that my accomplishment or what I thought
were astonishing or not so astonishing
accomplishments were amazing
to her and she said that she may have
just spoken to the future President of
the United States at first I was
flattered who doesn&#39;t want to be told
that they are probably the future
President of the United States but see I
have bad news for you I can&#39;t be
President next slide for the following
reasons I&#39;m female I&#39;m latina and I&#39;m 5
to see being female is hard out of the
45 presidents none or neither are still
female there has not been a female voted
into office and sometimes I think why
because I believe that women are as
strong and beautiful and intelligent as
men I believe that we are equally
created so then why are we in top
positions why isn&#39;t there a
resident that has been female see when I
chose my topic I had to think really
really hard I didn&#39;t know what I wanted
to speak on but growing up I&#39;ve always
told my parents I&#39;m gonna make it big
one day and I told my mom one day you
know what I want to be the first female
president of the United States and she
looked at me and she said you can do it
and at first I was it was just an idea I
didn&#39;t know how to pursue it
but then as I got older I started to
realize that is just wasn&#39;t oh I want to
be the president of the United States so
it&#39;s just gonna magically happen see
none have been female and people tend to
think that women don&#39;t possess the same
leadership skills that men do why is
this also men say women aren&#39;t qualified
for top notch positions why just think
about it
why see women have to work harder to get
the recognition a man gets I have to
work ten times harder to even be
recognized as somebody who did the same
thing a man did so easily the pay isn&#39;t
even fair
according to one of my sources that I
was reading females tend to get paid I
believe 79 cents and men to get paid to
the dollar see that&#39;s that&#39;s something
that makes you think why next slide
please
next one I&#39;m latina you guys may be
thinking what does this have to do with
becoming president well let me tell
you there has never been a Latino or
latina president in the history of the
United States not even a female
president of Hispanic heritage so how
will I get there not even ever being a
female president
I&#39;m also latina see we&#39;re considered a
minority and minorities aren&#39;t really
taken into account here unless we fight
for our right also in my culture it is
considered not disrespectful but it&#39;s
not common for a woman to go out and
work that&#39;s the man&#39;s job
the man does everything outside of the
house the woman cleans kuck and take
care of the kids see I don&#39;t want to do
that I don&#39;t for me I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s
not necessary because it is but I
believe that women have so much more
potential than just to be stuck in the
house don&#39;t you guys think so - of
course we&#39;re wonderful I mean look at us
next slide please see another thing that
I have always been made fun of is
because of my shortness I&#39;m 5 - and when
I first started this beach I was by one
so I don&#39;t know where that inch came
from but don&#39;t let these heels deceive
you because I&#39;m 5 - but see of the 45
people who have been president there
have only been six who are below average
height and by below average high I mean
5 4 I&#39;m two inches shorter than that and
at my age I honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;m
gonna grow anymore 5 - is where I&#39;m
staying
see at 5 - people think how is she gonna
control the country
she&#39;s so small so many emotions raging
through her see it&#39;s just it&#39;s crazy um
when I first decided to talk about this
topic I needed three main points and
those were made through main points and
a lot of people asked me why did you
include height but I thought about it
and most of our presidents have been
taller than five eight but taller than
five eight only six out of the forty
five have been shorter than her at five
four so I was just kind of like it blew
my mind and I was like I might be the
first female president but also the
shortest so there goes that next slide
please
next slide please okay so my past
experience is uh last weekend I was at
mast and my precess something along the
lines of do you really believe a senator
or a president is gonna come out of the
city of Pico Rivera do you really
believe that they are the chosen ones
and I looked on my mom and my mom looked
at me too and we just kind of laughed at
each other and she said you can use that
she said because see a lot of people
don&#39;t believe in you I can tell you
right now I&#39;m running for president 2036
and I&#39;m going to win how many of you
guys will laugh raise your hand to be
honest
see I know there&#39;s at least two three of
you in the audience that don&#39;t believe
in me I&#39;m just a person doing a TED talk
that in 2036 will probably be doing
minimum-wage job but that&#39;s not me
I don&#39;t want to do that I want to be
more I don&#39;t want to be living off
minimum wage and stressing about just
things that I have to pay
and running errands I don&#39;t want to be
that I don&#39;t want to do that I want to
be and do so much more
so in Spanish this was a week ago in
Spanish miss Puckett&#39;s it&#39;s something
that I&#39;ll never forget she said you have
to make yourself who you want to be and
you tell your kids I&#39;m sure you tell
your kids follow your dreams
but when your kids tell you oh one day
I&#39;m going to run for president you laugh
it off with a light heart you say yeah
sweetie you are but you don&#39;t take them
seriously and they may be young but as
you grow older you aspire to be more
this is something that I realized as I
was growing up see the question that
always came to me was why is there such
a stigma around young people pursuing
positions of high authoritative power
see I come from a city that is not very
well known I come from a city where
people drop out of high school they&#39;re
involved and a lot of gangs drugs and
there were certain people where I told
them I&#39;m going to go to Harvard I&#39;m
going to pursue a career as an attorney
and I&#39;m going to run for president and
people would look at me my peers would
look at me my friends you&#39;re crazy
you&#39;re never gonna get out of here who
do you think you are you think you&#39;re
better than us and it was never like
that I just wanted more I aspired to be
more I wanted more for myself and it
really hurts me sometimes when people
don&#39;t believe that you can do something
see if you tell me you can&#39;t do your
homework in two and two hours see my
teachers all the time don&#39;t
procrastinate you can&#39;t get it done in a
day see I&#39;ll prove you wrong I can do it
in a day
they don&#39;t believe me
I&#39;ll do it in a day and I&#39;ll get that a
plus C you have to do and say what you
put your mind your stuff your mind to
and that is the only way that people
will start believing in you
next slide please see I&#39;ll be the
exception when I tell you that I&#39;m going
to run for president and as my title
stated I can&#39;t be President I can be
with a lot of hard work I can be see I
have self-discipline
I have self-determination and like I
said before I&#39;ll prove all of you wrong

20:36 mark it on your calendars I&#39;m
telling you right now I&#39;m running for
president and you may not hear of me on
the big news because I may not have all
the money but I&#39;ll figure it out trust
me I&#39;ll figure it out
not only am i a leader but I&#39;m also a
person who wants to be able to share her
story and tell kids that it is possible
go back to my community one day and say
I did it and you can do it too because
where I come from there&#39;s nothing to
aspire to you go to college you get a
job to help your parents out and that&#39;s
it you get something that can get you
through life comfortably and it&#39;s okay
see but I want so much more than that
having like previous speakers said
before having the opportunity to go to
school for free having an education
having amazing teachers made amazing
advisors like mr. West amazing parents
and brothers and cousins alike it&#39;s it&#39;s
wonderful
that I&#39;m up here right now telling you
this because I would have never imagined
in my whole life that I would want to be
president and I would be sharing this
with you so make sure one more time make
sure to mark your calendars 2036 I&#39;m
telling you I&#39;m going to be the
exception thank you
[Applause]
