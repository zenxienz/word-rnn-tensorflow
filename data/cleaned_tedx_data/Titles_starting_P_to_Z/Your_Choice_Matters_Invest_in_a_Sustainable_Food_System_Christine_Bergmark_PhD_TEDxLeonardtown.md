this is a story of how our dreams
intentions imagination and choices can
help change the world
each and every day be true to your
dreams be bold take chances you never
know where it&#39;s going to take you I&#39;m
dr. Christine Burke mark my husband and
I own Evenstar organic farm here in
Lexington Park when I was 13 I wanted to
change the world don&#39;t we all at 13 I
grew up on Long Island in New York in a
beautiful place surrounded by the forest
a 30 minute bike ride to the nearest
beach is a train ride to one of the most
magnificent cities in the world I knew
how blessed I was I had a roof over my
head I had food on my table and I knew
that because I was born in that place
and at that time I had choices my
Swedish heritage taught me the value of
hard work to be resourceful to build
things and to be appreciative although I
sometimes have a little hard time with
that last bit but I knew because of that
happenstance of being born when and
where I was that I had choices about
what I could do with my life choices
that not everyone has the opportunity to
make see around that time I read an
article in The New York Times it was
about the famines in Bangladesh and in
India and I realized that if you go to
bed hungry every night you don&#39;t have a
choice you will beg borrow steal you
will do anything you can do to survive
and to put food on the table for you and
your family and I decided that&#39;s one way
I could help the world I went to college
to study food and nutrition and farming
imagine me a kid imagine me a kid from
the suburbs of New York going to learn
about farming talk about a round peg in
a square hole totally but I thought
maybe just maybe if
I could teach others what I learned if I
could help others learn how to fish they
could eat for a lifetime they could get
beyond survival to a point where they
could make choices about their lives I
joined the Peace Corps went to Burkina
Faso I worked the world over with US
agency of International Development and
when the time came to do something more
local my husband and I decided to grow
healthy food ourselves and we bought a
farm on the western shore of the
Chesapeake Bay
like many Southern Maryland farms it was
a former tobacco farm about 50 acres of
woods 50 acres of fields but when we
first saw it the forest had been
decimated decimated by somebody just
trying to eat got a few more dollars
it was so devastated I didn&#39;t think I
could live there but somehow it was as
if the land chose us and we decided we
would be good stewards we would help
that land come back and we would treat
it gently and with respect and so we put
every penny we had and a whole lot we
didn&#39;t down to buy this land and because
we had no money we pitched a tent and we
lived in one of these barns we dug a
hole in the ground where we cooked our
dinners we learned the stars of the
evening skies we heard all of the night
sounds and we took a lot of really cold
showers but we immediately transitioned
it into an organic farm and in the
20-some years we&#39;ve been there we have
planted thousands of trees the forest
has come back the native pollinators are
in abundance and our farm feeds
thousands of people good healthy
nutritious food people who choose to
support our farm and by supporting our
farm they&#39;re supporting that land and
the health of the Chesapeake Bay
in the years we&#39;ve been there we&#39;ve
employed about 250 people most of them
originally students from the local
honors college they didn&#39;t have a
farming background but they came and
they stayed with us year after year
after year they became our four women
and our four men we made mistakes my
husband and I went out farmers by
background lots and lots of mistakes and
as we learned they learned they argued
politics and philosophy in the fields
they ate well and they learned my
husband a former chef lucky me and so
microbiologist taught them about good
food and about healthy ecosystems when
it came time for them to leave us they
even though they never intended to go
into food and farming they&#39;ve gone on to
do amazing things with their lives
things in agriculture international
development environmental law and in our
own small way as a local business we&#39;ve
helped to generate a whole new
generation of passionate workers who are
going on into the field and creating
change in their own way
about the time we bought our farm an
opportunity came up for me to work on a
local project helping our tobacco based
economy transition into a new one based
on food and natural resources we worked
to bring the community together to
support each other consumers and farmers
artisan businesses schools and parks we
developed a campaign centered around the
theme your choice matters your choice
matters with every purchase that you
make with every bite that you take your
dollar power you choose where your
dollar power goes and what it supports
for example if all 126 million
households across the United States were
to spend eight dollars for 12 weeks at a
farmers market or with a farm that&#39;s
basically the summer season we would
reinvest 12 billion dollars that is a
whole lot of money going back into our
farmers pockets and a whole lot of money
going in to support our local economy we
didn&#39;t stop there
we noticed that at times of the year
there&#39;s a lot of extra product in the
field those gorgeous luscious tomatoes
or melons things that maybe just have
that little blemish or they might just
be surplus but in any case they just
weren&#39;t going to make it to market and
they sat wasting in the fields on the
other hand we have a growing hunger
community was being served by the food
banks and by the pantries and bless the
food banks and pantries for doing what
they do
but a lot of the food was non perishable
or canned goods and nobody was
connecting the dots so we worked to
influence public policy at a broader
level I&#39;ve worked with members of our
state delegation to introduce a bill
that would incentivize farmers to donate
those extra products to the hunger
community and by creating an incentive
to cover the costs just a little of the
cost to pick pack put it on the truck
and deliver it to the nearest pantry or
soup kitchen or food hub we created a
win-win-win a win for our farmers and
our local economy a win for Public
Health and a win for the environment
I bring to you a startling observation
it&#39;s been said that in the next 15 years
70% of our farms will transition into
new hands and the question is into whose
hands we can choose if we want to keep
our farm lands as farms we can choose to
go just a little out of our way we can
shop at a farmers market at a farm stand
we can join a CSA Community Supported
Agriculture for weekly deliveries of
food from a local farm and we can shop
and dine at stores and restaurants that
truly truly buy from our local farms
this is my husband the guy with the
tomato on his head you can see why I
love him we can mindfully and
intentionally choose to support our
local businesses and when we do that we
keep our local economy thriving we help
our country stay beautiful and
prosperous but when we can and when it
makes sense
change is good we need change we need
our global economy who in this audience
couldn&#39;t imagine living without our
cellphones and yet that wasn&#39;t the case
even 15 years ago but we can choose by
using our purchasing power we can choose
and help create the kind of change we
want to see the kind of lifestyle we
want to see the kind of world we want to
see for ourselves our children and our
children&#39;s children food is the catalyst
it brings everyone to the table to have
important conversations like this one to
talk about what kind of a future we want
to see and how we each and every single
one of us can influence change locally
and globally let&#39;s not let change
determine our culture and environment
but let&#39;s be sure that we ourselves
determine the kind of change we want to
see in the end your choice matters
