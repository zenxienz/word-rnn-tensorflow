in shown you are explorers just because
in nature around us here it&#39;s so
incredible that it has always pushed
people to explore further to go higher
and just to discover the world around us
I grew up here so I have that in me but
I&#39;m also scientist and when I became a
scientist I realized that doing science
as actually all to do with exploration
with the exception that we are not
exploring the earth but we explore the
unknown territory of knowledge and
believe me it&#39;s crucial is crucial for
science of course but also for the whole
human society and to show you that I
will bring you into my word and when
interests me right now as a scientist
which is that these little bats and
because we don&#39;t know a lot of things
about them and they are completely an
unknown territory just look at them
there are so diverse right some of them
have like they look like a big like a
dog like we don&#39;t know exactly how they
look like but they are so different and
with so many different colors but they
also do different things
most of them eat insect for example but
some of them eat like fruit nectar
pollen even small bats our fishes are
even blood which is kind of creepy but
that&#39;s what they do and we have no idea
about how these diversity arise we don&#39;t
know why we have so many species like a
thousand three hundred species and it&#39;s
an issue for us as biologists because of
course we have to know how species
arrived to understand how they are and
their diversity and so well of course if
we want to study them we have to go
where they leave and they leave actually
everywhere in the world with different
species density as you can see on this
map so of course we can go in the
northern hemisphere to catch them so
here for example in the US but since the
diversity is in the tropics in red here
well we have to go there which is cool
so we go for example to Belize here you
see the Mayan temple because they just
love to be or on these ruins here you
have a little
froot guy and the bat crew people I&#39;m
working with and because they are also
everywhere in the tropics and we have
different species that we where we go to
Puerto Rico
for example in the caves which is kind
of cool too and we also go to Trinidad
here it&#39;s a fish bat with very very long
arms and some abundant houses because
they just love to roost around so we
study bats and now we have the bats what
we can do with them actually exploring
bats and science
it&#39;s like exploring the earth when you
explore the earth you can&#39;t explore
everything at the same time you have to
start in a place and then expand from
that place if the same with science
except that we start with different
question and I would start with a
precise question I&#39;m interested in in my
lab which is bad vision and I&#39;m pretty
sure you are kind of puzzled about that
because a lot of people think bats are
blind do you think bats are blind some
of you
yeah some of you well fake news they are
not and they are actually very they see
very well like in very dim light they
have roads like us but some papers
recently have shown that some of them
can even see some colors but it was done
at very few species so we don&#39;t really
know what&#39;s going on and we don&#39;t really
know why they can see with a brighter
light and so in my lab we study the
situation in like up to 200 different
species of bats representative of the
diversity to just understand how they
see and what they can see and we found
fun results
most of them can see one color are on
green greenish stuff during the day so
they have a pretty like a
black-and-white vision but some of them
can see two colors the fruit and some
nectar bats so it&#39;s actually like being
colorblind instead that they can see
green and UV light that we can&#39;t see and
it&#39;s very cool because it show us
different things first oh well I can
continue first it show us how it&#39;s
important like how vision in bats is
more complex that we thought because
they don&#39;t Melissa
one colorada can see even some of them
different colors and it&#39;s important for
us because we correct a misconception we
have about science it&#39;s also important
for science in general because with that
we understand how species evolved we
understand the diversity and so we&#39;re
able to go further and further into what
we know about science how species
evolved and whatsoever and bats are
actually represent 20% of mammals and we
are mammals so the more we know that
mammals the more we will also be able to
understand about how how what we do and
whatever there is also something else
that is important about them
it is biodiversity as you know a lot of
species are disappearing right now and
like 25% of bats are in danger which is
an issue and well here you have an
example of that diversity and if they
disappear before we are able to study
them it would be an issue because we
will lose this reservoir of thing and we
will also lose a lot of potential to
understand how species evolved and how
animals leave and everything but okay
you can say well it&#39;s all about it&#39;s
still about science what about people
bats actually are very important actors
of our environments they are key key
things in ecosystems for example they
eat mosquitoes and they eat a lot of
mosquitoes and a lot of insects like up
to 3,000 insect per night which is a lot
so if you have mosquitoes wrong your
house you really want to have bats there
because they will eat everything but
also they will regulate the populations
and so if they disappear again well
we&#39;ll have issue with growing population
of insects they&#39;re also important for
fruit here you have this cute little guy
eating like a banana they really really
love that oh yeah and they eat that but
then they prove everywhere of course and
by doing that they will just put the
seeds everywhere in the world and so not
in the world like where they are and
they are so they they will fertilize
different places so they are very
important for
the dissemination of like 50 different
species which is important
same thing with pollen here this guy is
a pollen guy and covered by pollen and
they are implicated in the pollination
in like five hundred different species
of trees and because of that well if
they disappear it this pollination won&#39;t
be efficient and for example they do
very important fruit for us like mangoes
and tequila I love tequila
I don&#39;t want that to disappear so it&#39;s
important to be sure that we know a lot
about them to be able to protect them
such as vision echolocation and
everything else but you can say okay
it&#39;s still not important for human
health or for human steps well actually
you can see that here but I have a
picture of a vampire bats people are
studying vampire bats because they are
cool they eat blood and they are kind of
like a special mammal eating blood you
don&#39;t have so many of them that do that
okay there we go we have the images so
you can do the blood here this guy
eating blood and you can see the other
guy just crawling under the chicken to
be able to buy the chicken and to lick
the blood but to be able to do that they
inject an anticoagulant
so they can leak the blood for a long
time and when they bite you I mean of
course it&#39;s happened some time you will
bleed for like 12 hours so it works
pretty well and it&#39;s actually a field of
research if you look at that
well it&#39;s scientific articles showing
that these anticoagulants it right now
considered to be a treatment for strokes
but also for trombones is because it&#39;s
so efficient and so it show you how if
you studied something like bats because
it&#39;s diverse in everything you can find
something for human health and something
that can be really useful and so this
diversity is an important reservoir for
a lot of things for us and I will finish
on that example okay so you can&#39;t see it
it&#39;s a bad robot some people are
studying bad flight so it&#39;s exactly like
that
because they fly so precisely to be able
to catch insects but also to one or
Ronde that it&#39;s it&#39;s really interesting
to study and actually by doing that it&#39;s
people from my university with Caltech
Institute of Technology they realized
that it&#39;s so precise that it can be used
for in the Army for drones but also for
example in the future to deliver some
packages like your door something on
Amazon well that can bring it to you and
so it show you how if you if you just
study something arts as nerdy as bad
flight you can have useful application
so again studying this kind of thing can
bring a lot of things for us and it&#39;s my
last example what so what what is my
take-home here my take home is never
stop exploring Battin science and I&#39;m
not paid by any brand to say that but
never stop exploring science because
it&#39;s so important in our day to be able
to discover new things and it can have
so many important things for a society
thank you very much for your attention
