the Academy needs reform wake up all the
teachers time to teach a new way maybe
then they&#39;ll listen to what you have to
say because they&#39;re the ones who&#39;re
coming up and the world is in their
hands when you teach the children teach
them the very best you can
perhaps Teddy Pendergrass had the answer
to a modern a problem 42 years ago
currently colleges suffer from poor
academic advising high tuition and
archaic course offerings and majors
simply put higher education can&#39;t afford
to sustain itself under its current
business model old school academics must
welcome new school pedagogy with open
arms in an effort to bolster academic
freedom and successful student
circulation the Academy needs reform as
an undergraduate I would have relished
the opportunity to take courses like
writing for social media short form
t-shirt printing and design and an
introduction to hip hop in 2008 after an
8 a.m. lecture a young man nervously
approached me with a tale of how he had
saw me a year prior at a campus event he
said I didn&#39;t know what class you taught
but I knew I wanted to take it I asked
what made you so sure you wanted to take
my class he said you were wearing battle
ground flight posit threes
I&#39;d never saw those shoes in real life
you know
students arrive on campus is expecting
to see elements of their favorite
fashion favorite shoes they don&#39;t expect
to see those elements on faculty a
little background information about that
young man he&#39;s from the DMV area the DC
Maryland Virginia area where shout out
where posit technology is a staple of
fashion when he saw those shoes
essentially he saw home because that&#39;s
how he felt in my class at home that
semester and every semester after at
Johnson C smith University students
would speak to me before and after class
concerning personal interests eventually
sneaker culture would come up in 2015
that healthy interaction led to the
creation of English 296 soul food
digestible sneaker culture
soul food is the first English course in
the history of higher education
dedicated to identification within
sneaker culture via Marxist theory the
class analyzes the global impact of
sneakers
what started as necessity matriculated
to style to a culture with its own
multicultural identity students learn
how the signature shoe of a Japanese
pitching phenom became marketed almost
exclusively to African Americans in the
course the status symbol is exposed for
what it actually is proletariat where
ironically many of the students enrolled
are not authentic subscribers as a
culture however they do appreciate the
opportunity to take a course not typical
of higher education like our regalia
much of our subject matter dates back to
the 14th century I&#39;m reminded that I
started each and every year with a brand
new pair what if each shoe box had a
book in there on the first day of school
it would be my only care to flaunt my
brand new knowledge like a pair of nike
air why is my course important well it
validates the student it shows them that
their personal interest is worthy of
academic study if the literary canon can
be redefined
so can the liberal arts education
regarding the liberal arts it teaches
students to think to learn and to see
things as a whole it also contribute
to a student&#39;s happiness if you&#39;re happy
and you know it raise your hand
no for real if you have did you know it
raise your hand
not long ago I explained to a course
that policy and fractions were not to go
unnoticed penalties would be levied via
the course assignments that semester
there were no infractions toward the end
a young man pulled me aside and said I
know that this is your course but until
you walk through that door is my course
I made sure that everyone was in
compliance that young man graduated
became a professional athlete and author
he&#39;s seen more countries than I have he
had a say in his future by having to say
in his education not long after a
student walked into my office and asked
me to teach him hip-hop he didn&#39;t listen
to the genre as a child and wanted a
better understanding of references I
would sometimes make during lecture for
the next three years he spent more time
in my office and he spent in my course
offerings he became an executive an
advocate for rights of the homeless and
rights about hip-hop as an aside these
young men are products of the new school
unconventional pedagogy help provide a
platform for them to develop and pursue
their dreams regarding the new school
urban philosopher Kanye West once
besieged us to listen to the kids bro
new school scholars require new school
engagement traditionalists should
consider the desires of the 21st century
scholar regarding curriculum
development in the spirit of tradition
in 1991 Bjorn Borg attempted a tennis
comeback using a wooden racket
he didn&#39;t win one match message to the
Academy never be Bjorn bored if we
listened to traditionalists wedding vows
would all sound the same ESPN they
wouldn&#39;t cover a professional wrestling
in pineapple would not be a pizza topic
ladies and gentlemen the storms of
change are brewing or the Academy it
just so happens our students are our
meteorologists wake up all the teachers
time to teach a new way maybe you then
bill listen to what you have to say
because they&#39;re the ones who are coming
up in the world is in their hands when
you teach the children teach them the
very best you can thank you
you
