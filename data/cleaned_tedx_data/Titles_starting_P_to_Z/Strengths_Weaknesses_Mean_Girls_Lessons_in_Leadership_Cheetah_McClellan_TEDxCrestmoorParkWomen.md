whoo hi so in 2016 I came to the
realization that I had been duped duped
by living in my own little bubble where
everyone I socialize with would
generally agree that things like clean
air clean water
our basic fundamental human rights and
in my closest circles I could talk
openly and usually in agreeance about
such things as same-sex marriage and
racial equality but on November 9th 2016
my bubble popped you see I have a
daughter who was part of the LGBTQ
community and that morning she wasn&#39;t up
and out of bed the way she should have
been and I went into her room and I
asked her if she&#39;d seen the news
although I knew she had sitting on her
bed she squeezed me so hard it hurt and
she said mom I&#39;m so scared
and in that moment that Mama Bear rose
up in me and I knew I had to do
something so I made her get up and go to
school I spent the next several days
grumbling about how I was obviously
going to need to get into politics
because you see my bubble didn&#39;t just
pop it exploded I was shocked at the
things I was seeing being said about
women that were being widely accepted or
just ignored and as the mother of a
daughter and the son I knew it was my
responsibility to do something but the
big question was what and then a friend
of mine told me about this woman&#39;s march
on Washington I was all over google
searching searching hotels flights and
in my feasibility study I sadly realized
that I would not be able to make the
trip knowing that others would feel the
same way I said to my husband one day
why don&#39;t we just do our own work she
had been per his response Oh someone
will do that so that night
got back together with my good friend
Google and just started searching
women&#39;s March on Denver nothing so I
looked over my husband who&#39;s quietly
sleeping went to Facebook and he quietly
clicked on create event I said it to be
the same day as the women&#39;s march on
Washington I shared it to some
progressive pages emailed my friends and
said hey say you&#39;re coming to my event
so it looks like people are gonna show
up and I went to bed thinking oh it&#39;ll
probably just mean me and 50 my goofy
friends but that&#39;s okay cuz we&#39;re doing
something woke up the next morning and
normal fashion checked my phone eight
hundred people are coming to your event
oh I should probably figure out how to
get a permit I might want to tell my
husband that next Saturday I met the two
women who would become my co organizers
for the women&#39;s march on Denver and with
the help of four hundred plus volunteers
we pulled off what I&#39;ve been told was
the fifth-largest march in the world&#39;s
largest protest in history
[Applause]
it was truly inspirational to see all
the women and men that were coming out
of the woodwork to be part of this
global movement for social justice and
all admit it was pretty cool to be on
CNN women did a fantastic job of showing
up on January 21st 2017 and on January
22nd a million different grassroots
organizations popped up there were tax
marches climate marches science marches
immigrant marches and record numbers of
women had announced that they would be
running for office it was thrilling but
as I had immersed myself in full-time
March organizing with women whom I
barely knew I found myself constantly
frustrated with how I was in women treat
one another and it wasn&#39;t pretty here we
were supposed to be lifting each other
up and I could be here all day giving
you examples of how women were trying to
bring each other down before during and
after the March my personal favorite is
when the collaborator said to me Oh
people are probably just calling you
because you have a cool name well as
much as I love compliments wrapped up in
insults you know and I do have a cool
name write a comment such as that does
nothing but demean the hard work and
effort that I had put forth and I
started asking myself and others how can
we as women expect men to treat us with
the dignity and respect that we demand
when we don&#39;t treat each other that way
and I started wondering are we hardwired
for this kind of behavior and is there
anything we can do about it well turns
out that we are hardwired for this
behavior women resort to passive
aggressive tendencies because it&#39;s our
way of jousting and the prize is the guy
the best friend the social media
followers the job maybe even the blue
ribbon at the fair but we have gotten to
a point where we&#39;re not really
supporting each other and raising each
other up
you need to be you see in the context of
our primal existence women resorted to
this passive-aggressive behavior in
competition for males and in this way we
could protect our bodies which are meant
for childbearing not fighting but in the
context of our modern existence this
type of posture passive aggressive
behavior can leave real emotional scars
you see men compete in the realm of
strength and wealth women compete in the
realm of age attractiveness and personal
characteristics so quite literally men
could compare bank balances and do get
out and the problem would be solved but
women we do it a little differently we
find that loose thread in your psyche
that hot-button emotion and we push and
we hope and we&#39;ll tell you you look
right to your face but the moment you
turn around you will rule we will roll
our eyes with one backhanded comment we
can erase years of self-esteem building
therapy why well we can&#39;t go around
duking it out that would mess up our
pretty faces but here&#39;s what really
bothers me when you&#39;re a woman who&#39;s
just trying to make her way in a world
that has just barely given you
permission to be strong and independent
it is a special kind of pain to have
another woman tear you down just because
of your age what you look like or maybe
because you&#39;re different and so well
ultimately I know a lot of this behavior
is instinctual I do believe we can
overcome it we can find different ways
to work together and I don&#39;t care if
it&#39;s a woman that you&#39;ve known well or
have just met nobody walks away thinking
hey it was really nice that she said I
was resourceful despite my lack of
education yeah someone has said that to
me one time so I&#39;m here to ask today you
know what if we&#39;ve already proven that
when we work together we can accomplish
phenomenal things we proved that On
January 2
first 2017 but what if we got to the
part where we didn&#39;t judge each other
based on their appearances what if we
let go of that what if we learned to
appreciate another woman&#39;s strength
instead of manipulating others and to
thinking their weaknesses what if we
talked about the ways in which we&#39;ve
been hurt and have hurt other women I
don&#39;t have one answer to this problem
although I have come up with a solution
to this affliction that I call the main
girl and there is a great documentary on
this I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen it it&#39;s
actually spot-on but seriously I see a
brighter future if we can get to a point
where we can do three things find some
connection some common ground and
communicate find that connection between
your strengths and hers find that
connection that allows you to build each
other up and lift each other up instead
of focusing on those differences that
make it all too easy for us to tear each
other down find that common ground or
that shared goal all too often I haven&#39;t
been able to accomplish what I wanted to
because the women that I was working
with had a different goal in mind and
thus the competition would begin and I
think about what a man once said to me
he said shouldn&#39;t it be about breaking
the glass ceiling and lifting each other
through the hole oh yeah and isn&#39;t that
the whole idea behind feminism so let&#39;s
find that common ground where we can
stand together instead of against each
other and finally what problem can&#39;t be
solved with a little good old-fashioned
communication when tempted to judge or
manipulate or demean or gossip ask
yourself some really important questions
like do I need to tear this person down
to lift myself up does my success depend
on their failure
and then take it a step farther and ask
them some questions maybe it&#39;s a really
simple question like how are you maybe
it&#39;s a more complex question like what
are your intentions but whatever the
questions are listen very carefully to
the answers because within those answers
you might find some connection some
inspiration and some compassion for a
woman who&#39;s just trying to do what we&#39;re
all trying to do is make our way
in a patriarchal
