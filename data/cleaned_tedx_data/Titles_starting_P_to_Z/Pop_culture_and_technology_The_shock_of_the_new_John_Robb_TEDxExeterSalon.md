good afternoon yeah so where the shock
of the new I remember I&#39;m old enough to
remember I&#39;m definitely older from this
room
I remember 1975 Kraftwerk appeared in a
program called tomorrow&#39;s world a
program that dealt with the future it&#39;s
the first time I&#39;d ever seen a musical
outfit on a science program and they
look like the future they don&#39;t like 40
years into the future they did a song
called Autobahn for people still behind
keyboards playing a robotic manner they
pretend to be robots and have this
concept although in the future they were
tall just as robots which they never did
which are thoughts of fantastic idea and
it&#39;s like at that time pop culture
itself was fast forward into the future
pop culture has also always been a
window for the future it&#39;s also a place
where you can get bogged down in the
past what seems very futuristic wants
now has become antique not these days
it&#39;s like a real fetish ik love or vinyl
which is odd at one time vinyl would
have been the cutting edge of technology
the 45 rpm single which punctuated the
1960s every every six weeks or every two
months the Beatle singles would be like
a comma or a full stop in the
fast-forward of that decade nowadays
those vinyl singles have become
collector species teenagers now buy
vinyl by buying into a mythical past
where music apparently meant more than
it does now it&#39;s like a fear of the
future the vinyls now become like the
grandfather clock of our times like an
antique which I find strange because I
like the idea of pop culture still going
fast-forward now at that moment in 1975
when I was like a teenager watching Top
of the Pops or watching tomorrow&#39;s world
when Kraftwerk appeared there with our
reptilian like robotic appearance that
was a future I was like really obsessed
by that time pop culture was like in
love for the future
they&#39;ve been David Bowie who looked like
he came beamed from 20 years into the
future into the middle of the 1970s
they&#39;re being Pink Floyd like ten years
earlier Hawkwind doing space walk it was
all about the fast-forward there&#39;s still
a fast-forward
but there&#39;s also like a drag back an
anchor into the past but pop culture has
always been like a very interesting
reflection of light technology so where
does technology fit into pop culture now
pop culture itself is trying to grapple
with technology change the way we make
music it changes the way we listen to
music it changes the way we relate to
music so for a lot of people nowadays
listen to music it&#39;s not like when I was
at same teenager that quest to get a
record to get a piece of music that time
when I saw craft work that night it
would take me like four weeks to even go
and buy the piece of their music it took
so long for the local record shop in
Blackpool to get the pieces together
yeah single or the album for all I know
in Blackpool now it probably still takes
four weeks to get that piece of music
for nowadays you could just get your
phone out go onto spy-fi
instantly you can find those PC music
which I totally love this idea at that
time I want everything to go faster and
faster I don&#39;t want things to go slower
and I want technology to make things
more accessible and faster I don&#39;t want
to be locked in into blackboard like I
was then I want the whole world in my
pocket and this is what an iPhone or a
mobile or a similar a mobile phone could
do and this idea that you are now
central to pop culture pop culture is
available to everybody now because of my
age I grew up on rock and punk rock was
it fulcrum the turning point in kind of
pop culture so might want to my pop
culture went from something that aliens
like David Bowie made was beamed into
your room by the current tenant of time
the black-and-white TV set because
nobody knew what a color television at
the time was that punk rock was that
point in time where you can actually
make it yourself it was primitive it&#39;s
like trying to describe sometimes I have
to go to colleges and talk about these
times like talk about it I had the
Victorian here or being like in living
in a cave or something you know what I
can
you bought guitars you hit them with
your hands and somehow you made a record
and you distribute that record in a year
later somebody actually might hear it
now you can put it onto the internet now
you can access music from all over the
world really really quickly and I think
that changes things the way people make
music when I hear Mata music now and
what a music it is very best it&#39;s like a
fusion of like all different styles you
could take a little piece in Afghan
he&#39;ll music a little piece of grind from
London a little piece of black metal
from Norway and crates whole like fusion
of styles like a whole bricolage of
music that this idea that it&#39;s a way of
going forward by recreating pieces of
the past and this is way that technology
kind of works in a sense makes
everything like really really instant
everything all at once and it also
places the music fun into the central
pop culture what is the time you were
just a passive consumer you were just
going down to the record shop ordering
that record and hopefully would turn up
four weeks later with a sleeve in times
now you can make your own music you can
list all this kind of music and we have
become the media the media is not this
kind of thing
there&#39;s over there far away the distance
with these great tablets of wisdom
handed down to us we are the media this
is what happens now this is what young
bands are their Facebook pages it&#39;s what
people become for good or worse because
sometimes their banality of Technology
is absolutely stunning a tidal wave of
nothingness that just fills the world or
like in maybe 100 years time with aliens
finally find us in our far-flung corner
of the universe Wow all they ever did
was take pictures of their breakfast and
put them online forever and ever and
ever but this idea that our lives are as
interesting as the bus you know these
these kind of pops pop aliens for the
1970s I quite like that the dem√≥cratas
eight democratization of pop culture
where as your life is as interesting as
Posh Spice ease life you know this is
this is a powerful message which we have
to have important rocks that you are the
center of your own little micro universe
and we can actually do this now with
technology and I like this idea that you
can make your own music in your pockets
where as forty years ago if you wanted
to make music you&#39;d have to go to school
bully people into being in a band with
you now you just get out your mobile
phone out of your pockets and you just
get onto GarageBand and you can write a
symphony orchestra piece this is
absolutely quite stunning a my last
album we actually we&#39;ve gone house well
strings and about four tracks I can&#39;t
play a violin do I look like a kind of
person could play a violin I could
barely play a bass guitar board garage
bounds I can actually arrange whole
string sections with that thumb which is
actually incredible
and we thought well what we&#39;ll do is
we&#39;ll get a proper string section at
some point and they could play the pass
I&#39;m gonna thought I can&#39;t tell the
difference it actually sounds like a
string section and we left it on that
don&#39;t tell anybody but all that put all
the string sections on the album had
just done the back of a van or an iPhone
they still sound good it&#39;s just like a
trick of the year and I really love this
idea but then there&#39;s the reaction of
everything you get in pop culture is
there a reaction or a counter-reaction
them go back to this idea the purity of
vinyl and I&#39;ve always had this notion
that one day I should be doing today
actually he&#39;s put a screen up I have a
record player here and an iPhone here
and play the same piece of music to see
if anybody can actually tell which one
is vinyl and which one it is because I
don&#39;t think most people can I think most
people&#39;s ears are so battered for listen
definitely so loud I&#39;d be very surprised
you could tell the difference of course
if the aesthetic of vinyl and that thing
about holding something like holding
onto a piece of cardboard with a
beautiful picture on it or holding onto
the past as the vinyl vinyl now become
like the grandfather clock they&#39;re like
an antique collection and I think that&#39;s
kind of interesting is something a
culture that was always about the future
there are more and more it&#39;s obsessing
with the past right now we you could buy
a magazine and I&#39;m guilty or with the
magazine I do as well because the only
way you can actually sell a magazine is
do articles and things that people did
20 years ago in pop culture when when
those things at a time were actually the
future so this blurring of the future in
the past is also something it&#39;s very
very internet very very kind of parts of
the future that we&#39;re currently living
in the way that like if you&#39;re 16 and
you hear the doors now that is that&#39;s
new you know not in a sense this kind of
leveling out of music that what came out
last week is this futuristic something
came out 45 years ago it&#39;s an
interesting idea it never happened when
I was growing up you know this it was
always about Top of the Pops where was
until the pops came out that week it was
brand-new that was the moment in pop
culture was a snapshot of that time the
snapshot this time it&#39;s like a digital
mess it&#39;s like a load of things coming
all at once this avalanche of ideas and
bits and pieces and you just chop them
all up and make your own colored little
playlist to put on Spotify and onto your
Facebook Facebook page and I like those
eyes I like this
no fear of the future I think the future
is a fascinating place I just can&#39;t wait
to get there you know just been waiting
since that appearance by Kraftwerk in
1975 to get to the future a future of
time it&#39;s predicted that we&#39;d all be
living like in spaceships just in gold
like outfits or something it didn&#39;t
quite happen like that but the internet
kind of changed everything the next like
fulcrum in pop culture was the internet
arrived and for musicians it made life
very difficult because nobody and ever
could shuffle their feet nervously now
but nobody pays for music anymore so now
we have to go out and play live concerts
and get on our knees and force people to
buy CD so then get home again this is
not future that we were looking for 1975
it&#39;s an all kind of future it&#39;s like we
become corner shop owners so nigga in a
way we&#39;ve got kind of gone back to the
past again instead of lying flying
around with jetpacks going to gigs or
something we actually stand in the
corner room of the venue he&#39;s kind of
weird sweaty middle-aged people trying
to sell you a CD a format amusing which
we can&#39;t stand because he looks so damn
ugly but I&#39;m good to vinyl people
something viral it&#39;s far better than the
CD thers though they&#39;re both is useless
to carry around I mean I live in a flat
with a bat room is just like chock-full
of vinyl than the CDs I look at and go
it&#39;s so much stuff on there I couldn&#39;t
be bothered to getting throw out you
know that&#39;s kind of strange old men live
in houses for newspapers but they can&#39;t
start to come and dig them out were
there about 80 I have like a nightmare
vision of that happening eventually this
is why I love the iPhone because you can
get the whole that room put it into your
pockets you could do everything
everything into one little space and
which I like the compact nature of that
I like the feeling of the digital fast
forward to the future BIOS align was our
dog how bizarre I heard a dog barking
there look he&#39;s turned up yeah so and
actually this this is actually this
beautiful drawing which I did myself
because you&#39;re not allowed to have any
images that are copyrighted and I didn&#39;t
see tablet very typically of these
modern times everything I seem to own
it&#39;s owned by somebody else or any piece
of artwork you ever own it&#39;s been made
by someone else and because it&#39;s the
internet you kind of collect input into
your phone like every riff every piece
of music is
bricolage a recycling thing here I&#39;d say
that cause you&#39;re not allowed you much
allowed to show with its copywriting
which is good cause that&#39;s the law and
it&#39;s a law that should be respected so I
had to make my own piece of artwork
which you can tell it&#39;s not Picasso
obviously this is but what what is
slowly interest about this is actually
did it on my iPad and I thought this
really and it sounds kind of sums up
this kind of conversation this idea that
you can use a high tech to make
primitive art
[Applause]
