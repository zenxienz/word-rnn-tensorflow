all really fantastic female civil
servants so a little bit about me first
I am the permanent so actually the plant
for international trade di T was set up
shortly after the vote to leave the
European Union we do three things we
finance and promote international trade
around the world we negotiate free trade
deals and market access deals and we
champion free trade but I&#39;m not here to
talk about that today my little bit
about my background I began my career in
the civil service in 2000 after a stint
in the private sector I started as an
economist on a one-year temporary
contract and I never left so I always
say to people beware before you start
working in the civil service because the
interest and the complexity of the jobs
that we do mean you will never leave
once you&#39;ve had the chance to work on
those I think we&#39;re very lucky and
privileged to do what we do I spent most
of my career in the ministry of justice
and its predecessor departments with a
couple of stints in the Cabinet Office
and a couple of stints in the Foreign
Office and now I&#39;m building an
international economic department 3,600
people around the world and I have three
kids when I&#39;m not doing that wasn&#39;t
showing off by the way that was just the
nature saying I totally hear and all
other points that have been made earlier
today I want to talk to you about
ambitious leadership and I want to talk
to you about your ambitious leadership
and before I do I just want to say that
leaders are not the same thing as bosses
so the best leader you know will may not
be a boss probably isn&#39;t your boss they
may not be someone at the top of your
organization they might be someone who
works for you they might be someone who
works alongside you but the one thing
that great leaders all do is they take
organizations and people to places that
they wouldn&#39;t have got to otherwise and
that&#39;s how you can spot them so the best
leader that I work with was a peer of
mine at the Ministry of Justice we were
implementing together a really big major
program lots of
scrutiny lots of media interest and I
was reliant on him to bring his
organization with him and so sometimes
you will look around you and you will
see the people you will spot great
leaders and you should watch them
because great leaders are worth their
weight in gold so I&#39;m gonna talk about a
concept that has been very important for
me in my leadership and in what I would
describe as achieving more ambitious
leadership so does anyone in this room
like jazz it&#39;s not compulsory right okay
it&#39;s not compulsory to like jazz but it
helps you might have heard of a
saxophonist called Wayne Shorter one of
the jazz Giants played with Miles Davis
complete jazz great when asked a few
years ago
what does jazz mean to you he said jazz
means I dare you I dare you and when I
heard this this had this incredible
impact on me because the idea of using
this concept I dare you it was more than
just saying it was daring it provided a
connection it built that bridge
I dare you and it did something
expanding it said that music jazz could
be more there was more to it if you go
further and I think that that is a
brilliant concept to apply to leadership
the concept of I dare you
so what do I mean by that I talk a lot
in the department of international trade
about how I want us to be a bold
Department an ambitious Department I
wanted to be ambitious about what we can
achieve and I don&#39;t mean being reckless
I don&#39;t mean daring in terms of taking
risks in appropriate risks when you work
with taxpayers money
you can&#39;t ever be reckless you&#39;ve got to
spend that money wisely you&#39;ve got to
spend it on the right things you gotta
spend it efficiently but I do mean
unashamedly being bold I want us to be
bold we have something called the di T
spirit one aspect of that is being
enterprising it means being innovative
it means being confident and yes it
means being daring and I want to build
and create an environment where people
feel that they can be daring and they
will be rewarded for big thinking and
for self motivation
so given this one of the most important
principles in leadership is people will
do extraordinary things when put to the
test so what you&#39;ve got to do as a
leader is you build a supportive
environment you build a protective
environment and then you say I dare you
I dare you to be great I dare us to do
something really extraordinary I dare us
to take this organization to somewhere
it wouldn&#39;t otherwise have got to and
finally I think that I dare you can
apply brilliantly to your own mindset so
how many times have you been in those
moments of self-doubt you know you&#39;re
kind of in the meeting there&#39;s 20 people
in the room two people seem to be
hugging the conversation let&#39;s face it
not usually the women and or you&#39;ve got
to speak in front of you know a thousand
people and you&#39;re nervous that mindset
mindset really matters you know manage
yourself first really important rule of
leadership mindset matters I dare you I
really encourage you to apply that
concept that idea of I dare you to your
own leadership and so next time you&#39;re
in a sticky or tricky situation so I
mentioned you know people people do can
do extraordinary things and put to the
test
obviously you can&#39;t apply I dare you as
a concept to everything you do it would
be completely exhausting I mean as
already mentioned we&#39;ve all got enough
on to also be doing I dare you on every
aspect of life so I want to talk about
something that a mentor of mine once
said some of you might know him
Nick McPherson former moments actually
the Treasury meant to me for a few years
and by the way mentoring is the topic of
a whole other TED talk but you must get
a mentor if you don&#39;t have one already
single most important thing apart from
coming to TEDx women that you will do it
to help yourself as get yourself a great
mentor so Nick said to me a few things
really matter
good people know what does and I think
this is brilliant on two levels
first it&#39;s about Toyota&#39;s ation so if
you&#39;re going to be daring if you&#39;re
going to be the leader that takes the
organization to somewhere it wouldn&#39;t
otherwise have got to you&#39;ve got to know
what matters and that means you need
complete strategic clarity I like to
take a step back very regularly and say
what are we actually doing what are we
actually doing it&#39;s kind of like a basic
concept I did one job where I&#39;ve said it
so much that when I left the team gave
it to me on a monk what are we actually
doing but it&#39;s really important if
you&#39;re gonna build a bridge and take an
organization to get there where are you
going what are you doing and then you
can apply the IED a new concept to those
really really important things so good
people take people with them and good
people work out how to get there what
are the really important things that
only you can do in your leadership to
get you there and then you really great
people apply the idea concept to those
things so I mentioned people people are
the most important asset your team
nobody can do anything on their own I
mean literally you can&#39;t do anything you
can barely achieve you know it&#39;s quite a
lot of making it&#39;s work if you&#39;ve got
three children and everything else
that&#39;s going on you&#39;ve made it into work
everything you do is about your team the
single most important thing that you do
every day is interact with your team and
the people around you I don&#39;t just mean
the people that work for you the team
the team they&#39;re delivering things and
that&#39;s because they&#39;re the people that
are going to help you achieve the
mission so it might feel like getting in
the lift you&#39;ve got several emails that
have just come in and you&#39;re totally
focused on what&#39;s happening in your
iPhone no put it away
it&#39;s that one-to-one interaction that&#39;s
going to make the difference the most
important thing you do is that
interaction and you&#39;ve got to remember
as a leader leading by example can&#39;t be
delegated right leading by example that
is you you&#39;re doing it you&#39;re never off
by the way it works when you are at work
in most people in that space you are in
a cut you&#39;re like a plot device right
you&#39;re a plot device called boss and you
are never off the light and the shadow
that you cast these are crucial things
there
affecting people&#39;s days if you look up
beat and positive and confident people
feel good about their day if you look
stressed and harassed and oh my god
people don&#39;t feel so good you&#39;ve got to
remember you are never off that light is
really really crucial but like you are
shedding really important and people
want you by the way to be courageous if
you want to engender in your team a
sense of I dare you a sense of I&#39;m going
to dare you to be great you&#39;ve got to
look like you&#39;re prepared to step up but
you&#39;re going to be courageous that you
will step up you will dare them to be
great and you will support them and
build around them a protective
environment in which they can do so so
that&#39;s it in conclusion just to say this
is these have been really important
words for me I dare you and it&#39;s really
helped me work out what how ambitious I
want my leadership to be which is very
how ambitious I want the department to
be but also how to get there how to take
people with me what really matters so I
really encourage you apply them in your
own life or else five three other words
if these don&#39;t speak to you but find
something find something that speaks to
you that will help you manage your own
mindset will help you manage your team
and will help you take your organization
to somewhere you wouldn&#39;t otherwise have
got to thank you very much
[Applause]
