just a few weeks ago I received some
fabulous news from my younger brother
his girlfriend is pregnant and expecting
for the month of January so all our
family of course is very excited about
the news about welcoming a new baby and
a new member in the family of course my
role as a an older sibling is to
actually tease him a bit when he gets
over worried about what being a father
is about but what I did notice is that
one question was coming coming back all
the time an important question will it
be a boy or a girl
and of course it&#39;s an important question
and everybody is going to ask that
question and it&#39;ll be the third question
in any official form you&#39;re going to
fill in after the name and the date of
birth and it might well be the first
question that the mother-to-be will ask
when the Midwife does tell so the baby
is okay I&#39;m a Swiss pediatric surgeon
and I was I was lucky enough to be
trained in pediatric urology here at the
Birmingham Children&#39;s Hospital and that
means I&#39;m very aware of how this
seemingly easy straightforward binary
question it can become a bit more tricky
and complex so is it a boy or is it to
go well surely the first thing you can
do is examine the baby and have a look
and to understand how this can become
tricky
we need to travel in time back a few
weeks when the baby to be is in fact a
six week old embryo it measures as they
have 15 millimeters and at that stage
you cannot tell if it&#39;s a female or male
embryo so some specialised tissue deep
in the back of the baby about at that
stage will start responding to specific
signals and that tissue called the
ganado
tissue can either start changing to
become testicular tissue or ovarian
tissue or a mix of both or none of the
above that same tissue can either give
one gonad
the other or a mix less fast forward a
few weeks now the baby to be is fetus
nine or ten weeks old and measures about
thirty millimeters has doubled in size
at this stage these this gonadal tissue
has acquired the capacity to produce its
own signals and these signals through
the blood stream will affect the
different parts of the body and amongst
these the genital region again at this
stage just by looking at the fetus you
can&#39;t distinguish a female from a male
fetus just by looking at its fetus
private parts so the genital region at
this stage is essentially composed of a
central cubicle or a bud and two sets of
skin folds the inner folds and the outer
folds and these tissues carry some
receptors they&#39;re like antennas that can
respond to the signals that are blowing
it that are flowing through the
bloodstream and sometimes produced
locally while following these
instructions this little bud can either
grow and straighten up and the inner
folds will create a tube and that will
take the the appearance of a penis and a
loofah while the outer folds will create
the scrotum or other instructions can
push this this little Buddle tubercle to
actually fall down and be partially
covered by the inner folds taking the
appearance of clitoris in labia minora
while the outer folds will swell and
become labia labia majora so you see the
the wide variation of quantities and
type of signals and and the variety of
the effects they have on these receptors
and these tissues explained that we can
have a wide variety of aspects of the
genitals and the near-infinite
possible combinations of these
variations means that the aspect of
these genitals don&#39;t work as a binary
switch and in
the final appearance of these developing
structures actually tend to lie on a
spectrum between what we usually
recognize as being a girl or boy
genitals making this very difficult
sometime is in some very rare cases to
actually be able to answer to the
seemingly easy straightforward question
but you&#39;ll be thinking in the 21st
century there must be a tests we can do
if we can&#39;t just see things we can there
must be a test we can do to be able to
answer this well we can look at the
chromosomes and we all we&#39;ve all learnt
at school about chromosomes boys carry
XY sexual chromosomes and girls carry xx
sexual chromosomes but in essence
chromosomes carry genes and genes
unfortunately can travel from one
chromosome to the other so we can have a
situation where crucial genes that
should be lying on the y chromosome are
actually living elsewhere we can have
individuals that have different
combination of sexual chromosomes have
one missing or have one or two extra we
actually have people who if you look at
their chromosomes depending on which
cell you actually choose to look into
have different combination of these
sexual chromosomes we can look into the
genes then and look into the proteins
there they they code for but all these
genes working very complex subtle
pathways and even if sometimes we
understand the effect of one of these
genes and it can give us some answers we
still don&#39;t understand the big picture
in some cases just completely elude us
we can look at hormones but the main
male hormone testosterone can be found
in in in some babies carrying XX
chromosomes to be extremely high or we
have babies with XY chromosomes who are
producing testosterone but the tissues
just don&#39;t respond to it so confronted
with such a fantastic variety of
different situations in people living in
contexts different contexts all around
the world I strongly believe that we
must avoid rushing into quick
and easy answers and to come back to the
baby you&#39;ll be joining the family soon
my message is they&#39;re not alone we&#39;ll be
there as a family and we&#39;ll help and
support every step of the way whatever
the choice is where they on the long run
and in my job it&#39;s the message I try to
convey that we work as a team and we&#39;re
there to help and support when needed
and as one as of my mentor says there&#39;ll
be ups and downs
it can be a long journey but we&#39;re there
for the long run so as carers I think
it&#39;s extremely important to remember
that our main objective must be to
ensure that we help happy serene
children grow up into fulfilled adults
thank you
