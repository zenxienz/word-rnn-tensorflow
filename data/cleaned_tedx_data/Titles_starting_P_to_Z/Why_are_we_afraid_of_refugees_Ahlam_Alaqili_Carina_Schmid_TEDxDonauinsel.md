hello my name is a flaw and I came from
Yemen and this is my city sana in my
country there is a war since 2011 since
the Arab Spring started but not many
people know that let me talk with you or
let me tell you a bit about the war or
let me share with you the first day in
the world it was one of the worst days
in my life so in that day I went out of
life for a job and then when I want to
go back to my home I was already start
hearing the shooting and the bombing
everywhere so my mom called me when I
was already close one kilometer to the
home and she told me a lamb don&#39;t come
back try to go to your grandmom house or
stay in some place safe and then we will
try to come to pick you up so I was
stuck I was in the middle so I couldn&#39;t
go there or there so I just got a
neighbor and I told them if I can stay
till my family will come to pick me up
so the shooting start become more and
more and I was just afraid if my family
can really do it because my mum told me
the car for shooting was in front of our
door so I don&#39;t know I felt like for
sure they will not do it and maybe they
will die on the street when they were
trying to escape it was the stress the
stress hours for me I think in my life
so I was pray for them and cry so hard
and I just want them to come to wake me
up too because I don&#39;t want today alone
so my mom called me after some hours and
she said we are safe we made it we are
in our grandmom house but we couldn&#39;t
come to meet you
I freaked out I was like I don&#39;t want to
stay here she said let&#39;s see what we
gonna do in the morning because they
really couldn&#39;t come to wake me up of
course no one can sleep and the house
that I was in was close to the military
camp so the shooting was like all the
time so we had to lay on the floor
because the shooting was entering from
the window stuck on the wall so if we
didn&#39;t layin in the floor we will die
absolute I couldn&#39;t stay for a long time
I decided to leave so in the early
morning I took myself and I went out the
street was so empty I couldn&#39;t find a
taxi at her of course so I decided to
walk to go to my family I walked fast
and I was holding my my heart in my hand
and I was just waiting to hear the
shooting come to me and kill me no one
was on the street and I saw a real dead
body for the first time in my life I was
like no I felt like I&#39;m in a movie I
couldn&#39;t control my tears I was crying
and I was like try just to focus in the
way running or walking fast and I
couldn&#39;t forget that big turtle now but
I arrived to my grandmom safe and I told
my mom that I came with a taxi I had to
and we couldn&#39;t go back to our home for
one year and then my mom said let&#39;s go
to our home not because it&#39;s safe
because we are done from escaping so my
mom said if we gonna die let&#39;s die in
our home
and she was right this is me two years
ago can you recognize my blue eyes
yeah so the situation for women in Yemen
was nothing changed before the war and
after the war in 2000 2015 I get sorry I
had a dream first of all I had a dream
and it was a crazy dream for a woman
from my country that one day I want to
live on my own and to be responsible of
my own decision I want to have a flat
and to have a cat but it&#39;s really
difficult for a girl from my country so
in 2015 I find something makes me start
live the dream for a while I get a
chance for internship in Germany for 3
months I was so happy that my dreaming
will become true even for a while so
this is the first day when I arrived to
Germany and this is Karina and it was
the first day to to meet her it was
really happy day but at the same time it
was so stressful I mean to be in a
different country different culture
different language was super stressful
for me so my name is Karina and I run an
NGO called the gory experience and
amongst others we organize intercultural
exchange programs so we had this
internship program for young people from
the Middle East and Alan wasn&#39;t the
first intern to come to Berlin but she
was probably the first one who came
directly from a conflict zone and this
was really new to us and it was
different for us and the next weeks they
were basically a mutual learning
experience for her and fast and there
were many things we did for the first
time like riding the bike or standing in
the rain in the forest imagine that this
was so special to her we also
explored a lot of different things there
were like a lot of things that we saw
for the first time and did for the first
time but we also had difficult times
because there were lots of
misunderstandings between us and also
lots of different expectations and so it
was a really intense time and there were
so many things to learn but the good
thing that longer we know each other the
better we understood each other and we
respect our each other sorry each other
culture after my internship ended I
couldn&#39;t go back to my country because
they destroyed the airport in my country
so my life changed again suddenly and I
became a refugee in Germany
and after a few months I realized that
not everyone like Karina I met many
people who they have a bad image of
water up it hurt me a lot and I couldn&#39;t
deal with it there is a lot of stories
and many things happen to me just
because of that like one time I wasn&#39;t
the bakery and there is a woman she was
just yell it an argument because she saw
that it&#39;s her right order before me and
she didn&#39;t cook she didn&#39;t stop argument
till I left and another time in the camp
and I get physically attacked from a
German security he want to punish me
because I wasn&#39;t on the line I couldn&#39;t
deal with that and I get hurt so much I
cried a lot
and it&#39;s something difficult to accept
it
a refugee word make us feeling human
ated so we don&#39;t need someone to make us
feeling more humilated it&#39;s not just me
and my story there is a lot of stories
outside and many things happen to other
people even not refugee other
people who they are student or worker
but they look like refugee when Alan
tells me stories like these I feel so
ashamed for my country
imagine Germany being a country that
committed some of the worst atrocities
in human history and still 80 years
later we are like this eight years later
we have people who hate other people
just for being different this is crazy
and it&#39;s not just our home story there
are many stories and when we look at the
statistics we actually see that the hate
against foreigners has been growing
after the so-called refugee crisis so
this is from a research study from the
University of Leipzig they asked people
in Germany should Muslims be banned from
entering Germany few years ago already
20% agreed on that statement today it&#39;s
40 over 40% this is crazy
another statement was because of all the
Muslims I sometimes feel like a stranger
in my own country guess how many people
agree to that statement it&#39;s 50 percent
so that means every second person in our
society feels sometimes like a stranger
in this own country just because he
occasionally sees a girl with a hijab in
the streets how is that even possible
so when you ask people what is the
reason for that you can ask people in
the streets you can ask politicians you
can ask scientists and you will get lots
of different answers because this is
complicated and there&#39;s not just one
answer to it but many however when we
look for an answer we try it we found
one answer that did not only focus on
the problem but could provide a solution
tool and this is called the intergroup
contact theory it basically says that
the more contact we have with certain
groups the less likely we are to hate
them or fear
let me show you an example from Germany
a very recent one so these are two maps
from Germany from 2015 on the left side
you see a map where you see where
foreigners are actually living in
Germany and you can clearly see the blue
spots are those ones that have lots of
foreigners which is basically the big
cities and industrial areas however we
also have regions with almost no
foreigners at all which are the yellow
regions and they have 2% or less
foreigners on the right side you see a
map with attacks on foreigners and the
darker spots are those ones with more
attacks and this is really crazy because
if you look at this you see that those
regions where there&#39;s almost no
foreigners have got the highest density
of attacks on foreigners in whole
Germany so this means those people who
who probably don&#39;t know as like a lot of
foreigners they also have more attacks
on foreigners but on the other hand that
means if this is true we could increase
the contact and lower the hate so that
was our basic thought when we started
our project and we thought we have to
come up with something that would just
increase the contact between people and
this is what we came up with in December
2015 I share my story in front of a
German student class I was afraid that
maybe they will not listen to me or
maybe they will not be interested to
know about me and it was the first time
for me to talk in front of other people
about myself and my country and my story
but after a few minutes talking there I
become more comfortable and confident
because they were asking a lot and they
were so interested to know more more
about me and I noticed that most of the
question was related to the religion
like are you Muslim or not and why you
are wearing hijab and so on
and I saw our I understood to the German
best correct perspective about our
because of their media so we continue
going to a school sharing stories and
answering questions I really want them
to understand that we didn&#39;t come to
steal their country like some say I mean
who got only his family and his friends
and his life his house just to come to
other country and do something bad on it
I tried to make them open their mind to
understand more about the refugee and
integrate integration and I think I did
and I made a change and one time there
is a group student group who sent me a
card for the Christmas and all the
student wrote for me a meaningful
sentences that really touched my heart I
felt so happy and I felt that I really
did change here alums experiences in the
school classes were really unique so we
started to expand our project and our
team and today we are very proud of
having over 20 and people going to
school classes all over Germany and
talking about their lives back home
before the war during the war and their
journeys to Germany so in the past one
and a half years we have reached out to
50 different schools already and to 1500
different students we have also
collected some data that helped us
understand our impact and the way we can
further develop the project so our
friend Martin has actually sent a
questionnaire to some of those schools
who participated in our projects and
amongst others he has asked them have
you been in contact with refugees before
and - a big surprise 71% said I have had
no contact or almost no contacts before
your presentation which is interesting
because there are a lot of refugees in
Germany now and in almost every little
village
refugees but still it means that most
people are not a contact most people
don&#39;t know each other stories so this is
something where we can make an impact
you also asked did you gain a better
understanding of what life in a conflict
zone looks like so this is our very
basic goal of the project to help change
perspectives and 95% of them said yes so
this is a very good start for us because
it means that with our project we can
actually make a difference now you might
wonder what a two-hours encounter
actually can change in the long term or
if it can change anything at all well we
believe it can because our workshops are
not just regular presentations in
schools they are very intimate ways to
getting to know a person and a different
perspective and we can see from the way
the students relate how they react we
see how they relate to the story is
shared by the refugees we see that they
are shocked about the stories we see
that they are sad we see them asking
lots of personal questions and sometimes
we even see a whole school class crying
over the whole bear stories that one of
our team members shares imagine the
moment when you have to say goodbye to
your mom and you don&#39;t know if you will
ever see her again or imagine that
moment when you lose one of your best
friends in a bombing this is something
that happened to almost all young people
in our team but only if we share those
stories we can make others understand
what it means and we can actually open
up a dialogue so this is our big dream
it is our big dream to share more of
these stories and encourage a lot of
other people to come along the way and
join us
so if you are a refugee don&#39;t be afraid
to share your story it&#39;s the only way to
make the society better even if it said
share it and if you are a local and you
still didn&#39;t hear a refugee make sure to
get in touch with one and listen to her
or his story believe me it&#39;s the only
way to make a change thank you
