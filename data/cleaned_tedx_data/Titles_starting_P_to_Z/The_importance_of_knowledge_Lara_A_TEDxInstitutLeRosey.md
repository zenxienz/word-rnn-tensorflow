my name is Lara I&#39;m a student in class 1
being at rosey for only 2 months now it
has already been an experience like no
other
coming here away from home my family my
friends wasn&#39;t easy at all
but I wanted to push myself go beyond my
limits and as Paul bouge a Frenchman
always once said why don&#39;t your horizons
look beyond your limits and
opportunities will become evident
motivations will become clearer and
that&#39;s exactly what I did when we think
about limits we think of them as a
barrier we can&#39;t go beyond but on the
contrary limits are made to be pushed
and surpassed without noticing we limit
ourselves every day in a way life limits
us to giving us a limited amount of time
that we just can&#39;t seem to extend but
some things are limitless knowledge
knowledge has no limits and the best
part is we learn something new every
single day but how can we do this now
I&#39;m pretty sure most of you have heard
about the oscar-winning movie Slumdog
Millionaire it&#39;s about a young boy
living in the streets of Mumbai after
death of his mother who manages to win
the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
competition only through the knowledge
he gains by the observations he made
while living on the streets now this is
a perfect example of a young boy living
in dreadful conditions who through his
knowledge manages to turn his whole life
around knowledge is all around us not
only in the classroom we just need to
want to learn I have a question for all
of you who here thinks they&#39;re addicted
to learning raise your hands
thank you when we hear the word
we usually think of a negative way such
as addiction to drugs alcohol smoking
but addiction can also be used
positively most of you didn&#39;t raise your
hands and that&#39;s normal but you are also
addicted to learning in fact humans are
addicted to learning we all crave
knowledge and when I say learning I
don&#39;t only mean Matt&#39;s science
literature and all the other subjects
you take at school but I also mean
learning through life experiences maybe
learning a new gossip or who won
yesterday&#39;s football match the
willingness to learn something new comes
from curiosity and if humans weren&#39;t
curious we would have become extant
millions of years ago we are all natural
explorers we are all born with the
willingness to explore and understand
the world but is it enough to want to
learn is it a solitary activity to
answer that let&#39;s look at one final
example Ataturk the founder of modern
Turkey which also happens to be my
country Ataturk is someone who was
brought up with only military education
but he was a man of wisdom he knew that
in order to survive and create a
completely different country he needed
to not only add to his military
education but also surround himself with
those he knew more than he did it&#39;s fine
to learn on your own but if you&#39;re the
smartest person in the room you&#39;re in
the wrong room don&#39;t say you&#39;re solving
your knowledge limits go beyond what you
already know thank you
