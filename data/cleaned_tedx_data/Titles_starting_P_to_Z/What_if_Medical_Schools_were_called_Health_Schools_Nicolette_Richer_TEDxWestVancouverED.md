when my daughter was nine years old she
was playing on an aerial yoga swing it&#39;s
one of those meters and meters of long
silk fabric that suspended from you know
really high ceilings and she was doing
backflips from this aerial yoga swing on
her last attempt my daughter
nine years old she let go of the swing
with her hands by accident and her head
came crashing down to the ground and
with such a brutal force on the hardwood
floors at the time when she fell her
head would have been about eight feet
off the ground so if any of you have
ever suffered from a concussion you know
how debilitating a concussion can be
they&#39;re painful often they prevent you
from living your life even to the
fullest so my daughter she couldn&#39;t go
to school she couldn&#39;t read she couldn&#39;t
watch TV to distract herself from the
pain and for me as a mother watching her
daughter go through this
it was also excruciating for me over the
course of 30 days I took my daughter to
see several different types of
specialists and health care
practitioners we saw medical doctors we
saw eye doctor as we saw concussion
specialists took her to physio
acupuncture cranial sacral I did voodoo
stuff with her I did anything to try and
get her healthy and at best her pain
would come down to about a seven out of
ten but usually within half an hour of
her receiving a treatment the pain would
come back up to a 15 out of 10 so after
30 days I said enough is enough and I
took her to the emergency room and I
said you have to check her out something
has to be wrong with her now I&#39;ve been
working for the last ten years with
people who suffer from cancer and
chronic disease and I teach them a
metabolic nutritional therapy that
actually reverses their illnesses so
give me someone who has type 2 diabetes
ms any type of autoimmune disorder
infertility migraines Crohn&#39;s irritable
bowel I mean the list is long I&#39;ve
worked with hundreds of clients and I
know how to use food as medicine but
when it came to concussions concussions
are an acute condition right it happened
from an injury similar to a car accident
and I didn&#39;t think I knew anything about
concussions I had done a lot of research
in neuroscience literature and but
really I didn&#39;t know what to do to help
her but the sad thing was is that none
of the doctors and other healthcare
practitioners could help her either we
know how to diagnose
concussions but we do not know how to
treat them so often people are left on
their own to try and figure it out and
often they resort to antidepressants
sleep medications and other types of
opiates that really they become addicted
to and this is the last thing I wanted
for my daughter so the emergency doctor

that morning 8:30 in the morning in
Whistler he said you know you might have
to prepare yourself that your daughter&#39;s
gonna have to be home for school for a
year before she might even feel better
and I couldn&#39;t believe it
the wait-and-see approach the do-nothing
approach this was not good enough for my
daughter it wasn&#39;t good enough for me so
then that&#39;s when I decided to apply
everything I knew about working with
cancer and chronic disease and apply it
to my daughter that day so I left the
emergency room we walked over to the
physio clinic and I demanded that the
physiotherapist massage her intensely
all the way through her body not just
her shoulders not just her neck not just
her head after that we are fortunate
that there was an acupuncturist in the
same clinic and I said okay I want you
to follow up this treatment with
acupuncture therapy to increase blood
flow circulation anything to help my
daughter after that we walked over to
the optometrist unfortunately being in
Whistler everything is just a
five-minute walk away so we were lucky a
bit different if you&#39;re in Vancouver or
in another big city so I went to the
optometrist and I said you know tell me
anything you know about how to heal the
brain from an eye perspective and she
thought I&#39;m sure she thought I was crazy
and she said but you know what there is
something you can do go get a pair of
rose-colored glasses
okay now this isn&#39;t to you know be
hopeful but literally go get a pair of
rose-colored glasses
and tape off the periphery of the
glasses so that there&#39;s less stimulation
coming into the eyes to give the eyes a
break and then to ultimately give the
brain a break so that&#39;s what I did and
what was incredible is her pain by this
point had dropped down to about a 7 out
of 10
so then after this we were fortunate to
have a therapy float tank company in
Whistler so I took over to West Coast
float and if any of you don&#39;t know what
that is they&#39;re basically sensory
deprivation pods and they&#39;re full of
magnesium so from a nutrition
perspective
I knew that magnesium is apps
lutely critical for brain health for
cellular regeneration for total body
repair so my daughter nine years old she
agreed to undress slip into the float
tank and she was in there for 90 minutes
absorbing magnesium transdermally
through her skin the best way to take
most drugs and nutrients so after that
her headache could come down to a 5 out
of 10 and I thought incredible we have
some success and again it wasn&#39;t good
enough for me so then after that I
brought my daughter home and I did what
I did best nutrition and I pumped her
body full if every type of nutrient in
high high dose that I can think of and
that was her lunch now she was tired
from all of these treatments in just one
morning so after that I had her lay down
and then I applied what I call the
Temple Grandin technique now if you
don&#39;t know who Temple Grandin is she&#39;s
an incredible woman who has autism and I
applied compression therapy so a lot of
you probably know what compression
therapy is if you&#39;ve ever had surgery or
an injury where you wear compression
stocking so what I did is I applied
compression therapy to her entire system
in an effort to compress and promote
healing and circulation and ultimately
to give her brain a break from all of
the incoming noise that we suffer from
every single day now my daughter slept
for two and a half hours the longest nap
she had taken since she was 3 years old
and when she woke up her headache was it
a 1 out of 10 Wow is right but it still
wasn&#39;t good enough for me so I fed her
again another nutritious highly rich in
omega threes meal and I took her to the
chiropractor and so at the chiropractor
I said listen my daughter had a
concussion and I&#39;m trying to heal her
and I&#39;m trying to do it in a day so I
need you to go through her and type
exactly I&#39;d had enough my poor baby was
in pain so I said you need to adjust her
body and make sure her entire skeletal
system is in full alignment from head to
toe so I said I&#39;ll pay you as much as
you want just do it and she did
after that her pain was still a one out
of ten but she had a sparkle in her eye
for the first time in a month so I took
her home and again better another
nutritious brain meal and put her to bed
and for the first time in a month she
slept peacefully all night and when she
woke up the next morning her pain was a
zero out of ten and the first thing she
said is that she was ready to go back to
school and since that day she hasn&#39;t
missed a single day of school because of
her concussion at all the reason why I
think I was able to do that for my
daughter is because I have this truly
innate belief that the body is not a sum
of independent parts but is in a
complete magical whole it&#39;s a
self-healing organism that if we just
enable the body to heal itself it will
because that is how our body is designed
the other thing is that we need an
entire integrated healthcare system if
we are truly going to tackle the health
issues that we are faced with now right
now one in two Canadians will be
diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime
anybody here shocked by that statistic
one in two Canadians one in four living
in a car with a chronic degenerative
disease this is an epidemic and it&#39;s not
being handled well within our current
medical system yes if you are in a car
accident yes I bow down to those doctors
the team of medical practitioners who
are there waiting in the emergency room
to treat you but again that&#39;s a whole
integrated healthcare team that waits
for you in acute situations but we don&#39;t
have that when it comes to chronic
degenerative disease now does anyone
know what this number is seven point
five that&#39;s the number of minutes that
GPS are given to work with you to treat
you to diagnose you to prescribe you
seven point five minutes and that is not
enough even with socialized medicine
seven point five minutes is a disgrace
because it&#39;s not enough time for a
doctor to look into the magic crystal
ball and figure out what it&#39;s truly
wrong with you now with all the work
that I&#39;ve been doing with my clients
they come to me misdiagnosed often they
come to me on the wrong medications they
come to me in severe chronic pain and
they&#39;ve been living that way even after
ongoing surgery multiple surgeries after
surgery after surgery
and I know many of you can relate to
that okay our medical system is not
working when it comes to chronic
degenerative disease and that&#39;s the cold
hard truth so I have a proposition and
it&#39;s to rethink what it&#39;s like to go to
the medical doctor and instead of having
a doctor say hmm what&#39;s the right
surgery or pill for this illness because
that&#39;s what they are taught in medical
school they are taught to diagnose and
prescribe and that is it so when it
comes to our healthcare system we need
to reimagine medic the medical education
system this is one of the courses or
programs even that I would require of
all medical students and it would be
called food is matter better medicine
than drugs I met at a fantastic doctor
from Ireland and he said when he was in
medical school he was actually required
to read a book with the same title and I
thought that&#39;s incredible but just a
book there should actually be a program
because you see I&#39;m not a medical doctor
and in fact the orthomolecular
nutritional therapy that I teach my
clients that reverses infertility type 2
diabetes heart disease gets people off
medication and gets them to cancel their
scheduled surgeries it&#39;s done through
nutrition and doctors we know when they
graduate from medical school on average
they receive about 6 to 12 hours only at
some universities of nutritional
training and in most universities
medical colleges they don&#39;t even teach
nutrition at all so when I have my
clients who are doctors patients and
they actually healed their doctors go
how is that possible how did it work
well it couldn&#39;t have had anything to do
with your diet and in fact it had
everything to do with the changes it
made to their diet in their lifestyle
the second course that I would teach is
called the power of the human mind now
did you know that there was a study
released in 2014 that showed that in 74
that the sham surgeries were effective
in 74 percent of trials and sham
surgeries are pretend surgeries so what
happens is you could you you might be
scheduled to have a surgery and what
you&#39;ll go into the emergency room the
surgical room
then the doctors there will pretend to
do the surgery they communicate with
each other they pass instruments back
and forth they actually cut you open and
close you out but without doing anything
and it&#39;s been proven that the body heals
itself just from thinking that it
underwent surgery and the same thing for
placebo trials placebo trials are almost
as effective if not more effective than
most of the drugs out there and a
placebo is just a sugar pill but what&#39;s
even more fascinating is that even when
doctors tell their patients and
researchers tell the control groups that
they are given a placebo and that
they&#39;re going to be given undergo a sham
surgery they still heal which is truly
remarkable we don&#39;t know anything about
the human mind we think we do science
and neuroplasticity is still only at the
forefront of research right now the mind
is incredibly powerful and doctors need
to learn this in medical school and it
should not just be isolated to the neuro
scientists the third course that I would
teach is called anything but meds but
I&#39;m open to other titles as well perhaps
it&#39;s pharmaceuticals in surgery only as
a last resort or don&#39;t pay me until I
get you healthy any one of those courses
are the type of course that doctors need
to take not just a course but an entire
program because there is not a single
pharmaceutical drug out there that
doesn&#39;t have debilitating side effects
even death are associated with most of
these drugs did you know that the third
leading cause of death in North America
is medical error from Mis diagnosis
interaction of drugs operating on the
wrong arm the wrong organ the wrong
person so we definitely need a change
within our medical system now this is
not a far-fetched fantasy this is
something that is attainable right now
but we need to demand it as patients and
we need to demand it as citizens we also
need to advocate for ourselves do the
research do the learning go to great
lengths to do anything that you can to
keep yourself off meds to keep your
organs intact because your body needs
a healthy vibrant body if it&#39;s truly
going to heal thank you
