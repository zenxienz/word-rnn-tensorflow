you know as I was preparing my message
for you on rising to victory someone
asked me a few days ago what are the
four top obstacles in my life that
prevent me from rising to victory and so
I can imagine that in an audience this
size there are many of you striving
towards a goal striving to achieve a
dream and you&#39;re striving for this
aspiration to get to your destiny but
oftentimes I don&#39;t think we realized
when we&#39;re looking to achieve a specific
goal it&#39;s that a cost it&#39;s going to cost
you something and what it costs you are
challenges obstacles and hurdles that
you&#39;re going to have to jump over and
it&#39;s not gonna be easy so one of my four
obstacles and I also call them Red Sea
moments in my life so when I answered
this question a few days ago the first
that came to my mind at the age of 14 I
met my dad for the very first time we
had a 20-minute conversation so at 14 I
was really gauging the temperature of
the conversation to really figure out
when is the best time to ask my dad can
I keep in contact with him he looks at
me and he says I say to him can I keep
in contact with you and he says no I
want nothing to do with you I have three
boys with my wife and she&#39;s sitting
right there I have three boys with my
wife they are more important than you
they are my priority and you are not he
goes on to say I also have two children
that my wife had in a previous marriage
they&#39;re also more important than you are
they&#39;re also my priority and you or not
so I want absolutely nothing to do with
you and do me a favor
do not contact me again so at 14 years
of age meeting my dad for the first time
you can only imagine what that made me
feel like but I got
put on a good front and I smiled I shook
his hand I thanked him for meeting with
me I told him it was an honor to meet
him and that I will honor his request
and I did so ten days later I cried for
absolutely ten straight days on that
tenth day I said to myself get yourself
together and when I said that I could
hear God speaking to me saying that
you&#39;re special you&#39;re courageous you&#39;re
my daughter and I will never close my
door on you you can come to me 24 hours
a day seven days a week and I will never
tell you that out of all the children I
have in the world that you&#39;re less
important than they are and so on that
day I began to stand strong with my head
up my chest up my chest pull back and
stand up with confidence knowing that
I&#39;m loved I am special I began to
recognize my strengths and I began to
value my self-worth because my dad in
heaven said I am courageous and I am
loved my second read see in my early 20s
I was dating a guy and it&#39;s New Year&#39;s
Eve on a cold New Year&#39;s Eve evening I
have a my very long evening gown we&#39;re
getting ready to go to a New Year&#39;s Eve
party at his house about 50 to 70 people
are there and I go into the kitchen to
have a conversation with him and just a
very casual conversation it wasn&#39;t
apparent to me at the time that he had a
little too much to drink but what he
proceeded to do next was very evident to
me that he had way too much to drink
he&#39;s six foot on boy Levin at the time I
was 98 pounds I promise you I&#39;m not 98
pounds anymore so he proceeded to take
each one of his hands on my shoulder and
he pushes me down and I go sliding
straight across the kitchen floor so
there&#39;s people in the living room
they&#39;re dancing you can kind of see them
go into a robot mood and they kind of
look and they&#39;re whispering to each
other like what is going on what is she
doing did she have too much to drink
well he decides to push me down my
dignity is now
get away from me and I&#39;m completely
embarrassed because this man that I
thought cared about me decides to push
me on the floor like a rag dog and so I
get up I go outside and I call the
police to have him arrested the police
comes and he looks at me and he said
something to me so interesting he says
to me I never want to see your face
again so I look at him and I say excuse
me
I never want to see your face again I
cannot begin to tell you how many of
these calls I get on a day to day basis
from girls your age and women older than
you and it&#39;s always the same woman same
guy different situation because it&#39;s
worse the next time so that&#39;s why I&#39;m
telling you I never want to see you
again I looked him straight in his eyes
I said you will never see me again I
will never make this call ever in my
life again and I will never see that guy
again I never saw that guy again because
remember my Lord and Savior said I&#39;m
special I am valuable and I am loved my
third Red Sea at the age of 25 my mother
who was my very very best friend I
decide at 25 I&#39;m ready to sprout my
wings I&#39;m ready to fly I&#39;m ready to get
married and my mother couldn&#39;t see the
fact that I was ready to leave her I was
with her for 25 years I&#39;m ready to leave
her and ready to live my own life so she
decides to take it upon herself to
become very this loving mother she
becomes very vindictive very controlling
very manipulative and her goal was to do
whatever it took to stop this marriage
even to the point that she&#39;s threatened
to kill me so when I realized that this
instead of her accepting the fact that
she&#39;s gaining a son and we&#39;re including
her in our marriage in our relationship
she looked at it as this man has taken
her baby away from her and it turned
into such a manipulative deceitful
situation fast forward 20 plus years
till today unfortunately we
still do not have a relationship so that
is a very tough read to see that I have
to come up against at 25 years of age
it&#39;s one thing to grow up without a
parent but it&#39;s another thing to grow up
with one that you&#39;re like this your best
friends and at the age of 25 to know
that that relationship is no longer
there
that&#39;s a very hard thing to process my
read see number four January 25th 2017
this year four weeks before my tenth
anniversary I realize I&#39;m getting ready
to go through a very difficult divorce
this man that I thought was my best
friend my soulmate and whom I&#39;ve always
said to him my first love now I know
I&#39;ve been married before but my second
husband it was something special about
him I always looked at him as my first
love so if anyone ever said to me that
in 2015 you&#39;re going to go through a
divorce with your best friend your
soulmate and your first love and April
2017 almost five years to the date when
you all built your dream home you&#39;re
gonna be selling that same home and
you&#39;re gonna have to start all over
again if someone had said that to me I
would have said no way not me it&#39;s not
gonna happen yes way it was me and it
did happen but through that red sea I
began to learn through all these
different challenges and obstacles that
God has something special for me in my
life and so when we set out to achieve
our goals in our destiny
these little obstacles are there to
prevent us from rising to victory there
are four instructions that I follow to
get me to the point of rising to victory
to get me to the point of overcoming
these hurdles and I&#39;ll share them with
you in just a moment but one of the
things I really stand out from me that&#39;s
very relatable to these four
instructions there&#39;s a gospel singer by
the name of Hilary Scott she has a song
called still and within that song she
talks about these four instructions
she says that God is God all by himself
there are times in her life that she
tries to take control there&#39;s also times
in her life that she&#39;s so scared that
she can&#39;t see the end but she knows that
God&#39;s behind the scene behind the scene
Mountains out of her way that she cannot
see she also knows he&#39;s partying waters
on her behalf but there&#39;s one thing that
God asked of her to do for him and it is
to be still so these four instructions
that are relatable to this song really
helped me in my life it&#39;s the four
instructions that Moses gave to the
children in Israel when they&#39;re facing
the Red Sea he tells them now understand
the Red Sea this large body of water
they can&#39;t seep through to the end they
can&#39;t see the shore they don&#39;t know what
their obstacles look like when Moses
tells them number one do not be afraid
now not being afraid doesn&#39;t mean that
you will not feel the fear but what it
means is that you will not allow fear to
take a seat at the table of your life it
means that no matter what you will
persevere through it all to get to your
destiny the true meaning of being
courageous it means you&#39;re gonna
continue to walk on that journey that
God is taking you on no matter what you
face number two is to stand now standing
is very hard it&#39;s very difficult because
standing means and we need to stand on
the Word of God and trust that he says
that he&#39;s gonna do everything he says
he&#39;s gonna do with us and for us but
oftentimes this is what we do instead of
tan standing we paced back and forth I
don&#39;t know about the finances I don&#39;t
know if my marriage is gonna make it I
don&#39;t know if my business is gonna make
it I don&#39;t know if my children that I&#39;m
reared in a certain direction that&#39;s
going in a different direction I don&#39;t
know what type of future they&#39;re going
to live I don&#39;t know what that medical
report is like that I just got today I
just don&#39;t know what to do well pacing
back and forth resolves nothing standing
resolves everything pacing back and
forth means that you&#39;re worrying means
that you&#39;re not in faith but if you
stand on the Word of God you will trust
and believe that the picture of your
life has already been drawn the picture
of your life is already in existence you
are not fighting for victory
you&#39;re fighting from a place of victory
you have already won the battle the
battle is not yours it is God to win for
you you&#39;ve already received the victory
so why not stand the third instruction
is to be alert and see
the reason why you want to be alert and
see is because the miracle and the
breakthrough is that God is getting
ready to perform in your life they&#39;re
big but if you close your eyes because
you have financial issues and you don&#39;t
want to go to the mailbox because you
know the bill is in the air it still do
and if you&#39;re on the other side of your
door going in your house because you
know that marriage is failing and you
don&#39;t want to go in because your spouse
is on the other side of that door so you
know there&#39;s an argument getting ready
to brew you know that there is
frustration on the other end of that
door
you know there&#39;s anger on the other end
of that door do not stay outside go
inside it means be alert and see the
breakthrough the Skinner ready to happen
it means they&#39;re not ignore your
children because they&#39;re born in a
different direction that you have
planned for their life it means do not
ignore the medical report that the
doctor might have just given you today
or yesterday it means keep your eyes
open for the breakthrough that&#39;s getting
ready to happen the miracle that God is
getting ready to move in your life
because if you close your eyes you won&#39;t
see the miracle which means when you
come up against another Red Sea your
faith will not be there but if you see
the miracle that he&#39;s performing in your
life you will remember the next time you
come up against another Red Sea because
they&#39;re gonna be many more but you will
remember the breakthrough and the
blessing and a miracle that he performed
in your life today
the fourth instruction is to be silent
to be fondly because oftentimes when
we&#39;re in a stressful situation we&#39;re
constantly talking and we end up talking
ourselves out of the blessing or talking
ourselves and delaying the blessing we
got on the phone with our girlfriend or
a guy get on the phone with his male
friend and they&#39;re constantly talking
what are you gonna do what are you gonna
do I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do the
finance of the bad the business is
failing the marriage is currently the
children are going in their own
direction what are you gonna do be quiet
meditate on the Word of God and knowing
that exactly what he says he&#39;s going to
do he&#39;s going to do it you know it
amazes me we will stand outside and I&#39;ve
done this before many years ago when I
was younger we will stand outside and we
will wait two or three days for the
next-best cell phone because the manual
sure says that the 10 is better than the
9 or the 7 is better than the 6 I would
have got this in heaven sometimes and
says I wonder what would happen if they
just have the same faith in me that they
have when they were told that the 10
version 10 phone is better than the
version 9 we spend 3 to 4 times a day on
social media
I wonder wondering whether we&#39;re like
they&#39;re unlike I&#39;m happy right now
because I&#39;m like well at 4 o&#39;clock

I&#39;m unliked 4:30 I&#39;m liked for 35 I&#39;m
unlocked so I&#39;m happy I&#39;m sad I&#39;m happy
and I&#39;m sad but what I&#39;m doing I&#39;m
allowing someone else to define who and
what I am and who and what I shall
become I wonder if God does God to step
back sometime and say I just wonder I
just wonder if the same amount of time
they spent on social media seeing who&#39;s
liking them and unlikely them I wonder
if they took a moment to get to know me
and know that I love them 24 hours a day
7 days a week it never changes because
often times do we really know God or we
just familiar with him so one of God
says if they just get to know me they
just get to believe in me and have faith
in me look at the things that I would
touch in their life the mountains I
would move in their life the red seas
our part in their life so I ask you
today
what is your red sea is it your finances
is it a failing marriage is it way with
children is it that business that&#39;s not
the wane as well as you thought it would
is it that problem on your job or maybe
you&#39;re being overlooked for a promotion
whatever your red sea is today ladies
and gentlemen I ask that you trust God I
ask that you trust that your dad in
heaven has ultimate goal for you is to
rise to victory so you can live your
best life because you deserve it thank
you
