Patrick Sweeney and tonight I&#39;m going to
tell you a fear can transform your life
and if you&#39;re a parent or a teacher I&#39;m
going to tell you how it can have a
dramatic impact on the likelihood of
success of children and who better to
lead the congregation than a reformed
sinner that&#39;s my confession I&#39;m gonna
make to you tonight for the longest time
I was the world&#39;s biggest wimp now I
live an amazing life doing really crazy
adventures all over the place and I
found that I have a superpower and my
superpower is courage and I&#39;m going to
share that with all of you tonight
it&#39;s a gift that I want to give in some
of the science behind it which is
fascinating I think you&#39;ll find really
intriguing I&#39;m gonna leave you with
three lessons they&#39;re going to be
lessons in how to live a life of impact
courage and be the hero you always want
it to be with your family with yourself
or in a time of crisis in order to do
that we&#39;ve got to go back to 1976 now I
know the parents in the room get that
kids they&#39;ll have to explain that one to
you it&#39;s a little bit dated but imagine
if you will a duplex and a
rough-and-tumble suburb of Boston you&#39;re
on the bottom floor of the duplex and
you see a family sitting there there&#39;s a
young boy on the floor playing with his
GI Joe doll he&#39;s wrestling with the kung
fu grip he&#39;s not even old enough to be
worried about Barbie yet his mom and dad
are planted on the couch in front of
their black-and-white RCA TV his
brothers next to him annoying him like
always when all of a sudden on the
screen comes a scene of disaster boy
shut up
he&#39;s transfixed on the screen he sees a
monochromatic flames shooting up from
the tail of a Delta dc9 a newscaster
half scream half spits out the words
that a instrument pilot was coming in on
approach he flew too low in the fog
cartwheeling the plane down the runway
scattering metal debris and body parts
all over Boston&#39;s Logan Airport killing
all hundred people on board immediately
that scene is written on the boys very
sophisticated hard drive fast forward
two weeks and that same family is
packing for a trip to Atlanta Georgia
there on tan uncle has a new puppy and
it needs a home so the family&#39;s super
excited to go down to Atlanta and get
the puppy they haul their stuff into
Logan Airport and all of a sudden the
boy sees across the smokey terminal a
Delta logo on the tail of a plane he&#39;s
immediately hit with an electric wall of
fear he has a terrible response
emotionally to seeing that because that
image has popped back out of his hard
drive onto his mind&#39;s eye he rips and
pulls at his mother&#39;s hand trying to get
out of here I don&#39;t want to die he kicks
and he pulls in he screams get me out of
here he throws such an apoplectic fit
there kicked out of Logan Airport and
they&#39;re forced to drive the 15 hours to
Atlanta that ensures two things that are
both tragic number one that he doesn&#39;t
confront the fear so it gets further
written on his hard drive number two
that he catches hell for the next family
next 40 years at every family gathering
and he&#39;s bullied about it to this day
well not surprisingly that was me and
that was my fear frontier maybe you have
a fear of snakes maybe you have a fear
of the water everybody has a fear
frontier maybe it&#39;s failure we all have
a place where we come to where we&#39;ve got
a moment of fear how we deal with that
determines our future and our success
for 30 years I lived with this this
terrible fear of flying every time I got
on board or anywhere near an aircraft I
got more and more scared and one thing
that I found is this cowardice begets
cowardice I was even the guy in high
school who was still afraid of the dark
that&#39;s how bad things were I lived with
this for 30 years
and then my worst fear came to fruition
it could have happened to any one of us
I was working out I was in my mid-30s
and I had a pain in my arm and kept
getting worse over the next few days but
like everything else I was afraid to go
to the doctor&#39;s I finally went and when
I got into the doctors he told me I had
no white blood cells no immune system
that got me a ticket to the Johns
Hopkins leukemia matinee and this was a
special showing for rare cases now I was
petrified all I could think about in the
hospital was my one-year-old daughter
would the image she had of her dad be
the guy who was too much of a coward to
get on a plane and take her to Disney
World I was suddenly choked with a
deathbed feeling of regret like I had
missed out on so much in life and I was
gonna miss out on so much more that&#39;s
when I decided that I was going to kick
that disease and when I got out I take
flying lessons not to put the story to
bed too early but I did get out I did
beat leukemia and I started taking
flying lessons and over the next several
months my entire life changed just
because I went mano-a-mano with that
flying demon everything in my world
changed and I realized I&#39;ve been living
like a caterpillar on this tiny leaf
inching around eventually ensconcing
myself in this cowardly cocoon but I
never realized it until I flew and then
when I got my wings and literally
learned to fly my whole world changed
and in fact I fell in love with flight I
got my instrument rating my commercial
rating and nowadays I compete in
acrobatics every year this is a
competition last year and if this the
idea of being upside down with the
ground coming at ya at high speed
activates your fear frontier
maybe it&#39;s speaking
in front of a big audience maybe it&#39;s
asking a girl out on a date we all have
a fear frontier how we deal with those
determines our success and that brings
me to lesson number one you don&#39;t know
how great life can be until you get to
the other side of your fear frontier the
choice you make determines what your
life is like you&#39;ll only have two
choices when it comes to fear
you can either tame fear or fear can rip
you apart bit by bit I was so enamored
and so amazed how my life changed when I
got beyond my fear frontier and I
started to tame fear I want to make sure
my kids had the same thing so as a dad I
stumbled on something that the Navy
SEALs have known for decades and when I
first did it I got a lot of flack from
other people because they said fear you
shouldn&#39;t but you should be avoiding it
and in fact that&#39;s the number one
strategy people have for dealing with
fear is avoidance it&#39;s also the biggest
mistake you can make and that causes you
the most damage in your life avoiding
fear so I want to give my kids this gift
when they were three years old I started
him skiing when they were four years old
we were rock climbing at seven they went
paragliding I didn&#39;t have a dad handbook
I was just doing the best I could I kept
trying to extend their fear frontier
nudging them out of their comfort zone
and I&#39;d meet parents and they&#39;d say Rock
lighting and rock climbing and
mountaineering with kids that&#39;s crazy
and then I&#39;d meet the kids and they&#39;d
say wow rock climbing can you talk to my
mom and dad and that brings me to point
number two there is a dramatic
difference there are two very different
animals risk and fear risk is the
probability or the likelihood of
something bad happening
fear is an emotional response to a
physical feeling in the body they often
get confused and people don&#39;t understand
why if I knew the difference between
risk and fear when I was a
seven-year-old boy at Logan Airport I
would have never let my parents drive
just to put it in perspective in our
lifetime in this room three people will
die in car accidents it would take
twenty five rooms this size filled up to
have one put in a airplane crash that&#39;s
the difference between knowing the risk
so why isn&#39;t a mom who drops her her son
or daughter off at school who&#39;s texting
her boss at the same time which is
incredibly dangerous
why isn&#39;t she full of fright because of
that because familiarity fades fear and
that can work to our benefit and it can
also work to our detriment but just
knowing that fact makes a big difference
in our life so one of the things that I
found is with the Navy SEALs
there&#39;s fear-based behavior that doesn&#39;t
make any sense until you figure out why
you&#39;re doing it what the motivation is
if you think about it for a second
fear-based decision-making rarely makes
sense why is it you can be sitting on
your couch at home safe and sound and
watching something on the TV that you
know isn&#39;t real but have a tremendous
fear response it doesn&#39;t make any sense
why do we let our amygdala stay in such
control of us it&#39;s almost like put into
the soul and fear is on the other end
coming from Uranus all right how risky
is life really well I don&#39;t know but I
can guarantee you none of us are going
to get out alive so we might as well
live with the most courage the most
excitement and the most passion we can
we need to take a take a page out of the
Navy SEAL handbook because it&#39;s really
all about controlling the glands I
mentioned the amygdala before that&#39;s a
small gland at the base of your brain
that&#39;s shaped like an almond it&#39;s there
and it&#39;s fully developed at birth it
does three things it handles the three
FS fight flight or freeze it was there
to keep us from getting attacked by a
saber-toothed tiger what we found out
over the last hundred thousand years is
freezing like a deer-in-the-headlight
or bolting every time there was a rustle
of grass didn&#39;t exactly make us the best
dinner guess so we developed something
that&#39;s kind of like adult supervision
for the amygdala it&#39;s called the
prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal
cortex this is the rub isn&#39;t developed
until you&#39;re in your mid-20s the
amygdala the thing responds crazy
reaction of mine at the airport that
flight or fright developed at birth the
adult supervision and the ability to
make a rational decision not developed
until your mid-20s and how it develops
can determine your whole life that&#39;s
what Navy SEALs do every time they go
through training at Budds which is basic
underwater demolition school each day it
gets more and more intense until finally
during hell week their task bound at the
wrists and ankles into a pool
blindfolded with instructors literally
beating on them
most of these recruits are between 20
and 24 years old what the Navy&#39;s doing
is pre-wiring them for courage I got so
fascinated by fear I started
interviewing experts all around the
world one of the experts that I talked
with told me there&#39;s something called
preconditioning extinction before
preconditioning and I just refer to this
as preconditioning they studied Navy
SEALs and did an article in the military
special operations journal and it shows
that Navy SEALs have a higher resiliency
to stress than ordinary soldiers and
they have less incidents of
post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD
the reason I believe this is is because
they&#39;re preconditioning they&#39;re training
their mind to do this I used to think
breathing was only important when I was
racing I was a rower and I thought it
was only important then but it turns out
it&#39;s one of their techniques so is
increasing the intensity so the paradox
with all this is you have to get scared
to build courage you have to feel when
the amygdala starts to take over because
what happens is you feel your heart rate
increasing your breathing increasing
your pupils will dilate that&#39;s the
amygdala trying to take over but if your
prefrontal cortex can stay the boss then
you
can be a Superman or superwoman because
you&#39;ve got this cocktail going through
your body that makes you stronger makes
you think better it&#39;s there to help us
survive if you can use your prefrontal
cortex to be the boss then you can do
amazing things so one of the ways to do
that is using the neurons in your brain
continually getting scared if they this
is a video from mi t--&#39;s lab that&#39;s the
amygdala of a mouse and you can see
what&#39;s happening every time one of those
neurons fires if they continue to fire
the same neurons they&#39;ll build a pathway
neurons that fire together we&#39;ll end up
wiring together so the courage pathway
becomes easier and easier to travel so
courage has a halo effect if you&#39;re
trying to get over fear of heights and
you start rock-climbing on the weekends
one thing you&#39;ll find is you can go ask
your boss for a razor you can go ask
your teacher for extra work and and you
feel less anxiety because of it so the
point number three I&#39;m going to give you
is a tool for building up this courage
for creating that wire so lesson number
one was you don&#39;t know how great fear
life is until you get beyond your fear
frontier listen number two huge
difference between risk and fear lesson
number three is that you need a tool set
you need something you can rely on to
build up that courage I used what&#39;s
called a base methodology the B is for
breathing take a breath in for a count
of four hold it for a count of four and
let it out for four if you keep doing
that that&#39;ll stabilize your heart rate
the second one that a is to assess the
situation
so many times we project bad things into
the future instead be present say what&#39;s
going on right now can I make a plan can
I get in control the S it&#39;s
counterintuitive but smile if you smile
no matter how forest it has a direct
link to your central nervous system just
using those muscles in your face and
then e is for encouragement for
self-talk tell yourself that&#39;s not fear
you&#39;re feeling it&#39;s excite
that&#39;s a challenge if you use this base
methodology you might you might find
that well try it for yourself if you
don&#39;t like public speaking next time you
go out to dinner stand up and make a
toast and when me you make a toast
maybe you&#39;ll only get through the bee
and start breathing and then have to sit
down but each time your courage will
grow it&#39;ll get more and more easier to
do something courageous so if you
practice getting yourself scared
you can learn to be a great leader
there&#39;s a whole ocean of great leaders
who&#39;ve learned to tame fear and done
amazing things with it
but there&#39;s a vast barren desert of
timid souls who let their life be ruled
by fear and fear from manipulation from
politicians from marketers from the
press don&#39;t be one of those people go
out and learn how to be courageous learn
how to be the hero you want to be
remember excuses are just fear in
disguise go out and live the most
passionate exciting adventurous life you
can go out and find fear and live the
life of a butterfly thank you very much
[Applause]
