it seems that some children think that
bread is like a banana why do I say that
because I see some children treat white
bread or other breads like a banana late
the soft squishy inside and throw away
the crust crust is part of the whole
bread baking process unlike peel of
fruit or plastic packaging crust is
edible
some breads are all about the crust ask
the French about the baguette
so why still so many children don&#39;t like
to eat the crust it&#39;s a type of trend or
fashion like special snob Club for
children that don&#39;t like to eat the
crust we don&#39;t like it we don&#39;t want it
I mean why the crust can be eaten
actually scientists have proven is heat
hard things for example the crust of
bread can make your teeth stronger and
it&#39;s even a healthier diet for yourself
if you choose a crust lung in your mouth
you can taste all the special flavors
and determines it&#39;s giving used to grow
and what I sometimes do I bring a dip
like hummus or guacamole throwing away
the crust is a waste of good food so
many children and people around the
world really starved and we just throw
away so imagine if every second children
in my school at jst would throw away the
crust of their bread each year we would
end up with 3.6 tons of crust which is
equivalent to the food weight of a young
elephant could you even imagine if
chairs are and JSP does the exact same
thing each year we would end up with the
food weight of the family of elephants
could you even imagine if all of the
primary schools in the Netherlands did
the exact same thing each year we would
end up move the food weight of 800
elephants Wow and that just from crust
so I believe if we start eating the
crust
we can learn our behavior not to throw
our foods away
for example half-eaten apples or other
leftovers from lunch
boxes we can learn to take our food in
smaller portions also instead of our
parents doing our lunchboxes we can do
ourselves and we can learn and we can
and we will know what to eat and we ask
to also remember to remain healthy so
please don&#39;t waste food don&#39;t throw away
the crust do it for you do it for the
world
trust the crust
