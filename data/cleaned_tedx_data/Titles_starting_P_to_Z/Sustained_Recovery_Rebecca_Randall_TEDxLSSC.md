according to the book the sober truth
the national statistics for sustained
recovery are five to ten percent
hand-in-hand Lake County a local
nonprofit however with his powerhouse of
recovery and the Ruth house has a
significant rise in our success 46 to 65
percent hi my name is Rebecca and I&#39;m
also the founder and the director of
Ruth house in a survey reported by the
partnership for drug-free kids and the
New York office of alcoholism and
substance abuse shows us that 10% of all
Americans 18 and older consider
themselves to be in recovery these
national representative figures indicate
for us that there are 23 and a half
million Americans who are overcoming
their involvement with substance abuse
here in America we punish our addicts
through the criminal justice system they
break the law they get arrested and they
begin their careers in the criminal
justice system there are more people
incarcerated today for drug offenses
than there have been really in any time
of our history according to the
Sentencing Project the war on drugs 1982
there were four hundred and forty
thousand nine hundred people
incarcerated in 1980 while there were
four hundred and sixty nine thousand 545
in 2005 according to the National
Institute for drug abuse the estimated
total cost of substance abuse to include
the cost of productivity healthcare and
crime related
is six hundred billion dollars annually
at transitional houses like his power
house and the Ruth house we are able to
build community with our residents we
teach repair inton we go through issues
of trauma as well as life skills at Ruth
house we also are able to include the
kids in this process to some degree
everyone who comes to his power house or
the Ruth&#39;s house finds that there is
some trauma that needs to be addressed
in addition to the addiction work that
we do in the book the life model we read
that there are two types of traumas in
brain science trauma type A which is
neglect the lack of necessary good
things malnutrition
abandonment and a lack of joy in the
home are the things that are associated
with that trauma type B is the big-deal
murder rape child molestation those
kinds of things it&#39;s important for us to
know what the trauma is so that we will
know where to go to work one of the most
unique things about Ruth&#39;s house is that
when we have a client who is in crisis a
trigger we were able to work with her
not only to help her for that current
situation but also to follow the trail
back to the original source of pain we
also go through several processes there
where we teach day-to-day life skills
that are necessary for us to live by
it&#39;s the home setting that helps us
build community in order to do that
Johann Hari in his book entitled chasing
the Scream and his TED talk everything
you know about recovery is wrong he
talks about an
spearmint called rat Park the reason for
rat Park was they were aware that the
American soldiers who were in Vietnam
were using heroin and hallucinogenic
drugs it was thought that when they came
back to the United States of America
that we would have an influx of addicts
however that&#39;s not what happened what we
saw was those soldiers who came back to
the United States of America who came
and engaged in community and loving
supportive families they stopped using
right away however the addicts who came
back to the United States they continued
to use or the ones who didn&#39;t have those
support systems continued to use in the
experiment they had a cage with one rat
and two bottles of water one bottle of
water had plain water and the other
bottle had water laced with heroin the
rat tasted both of the water bottles and
there one rat continued to go back and
forth to the heroin laced bottle to the
point of death at that point they took a
community of rats said they put that
community in the same cage with the same
two bottles of water all the rats tasted
both types of water and the community of
rats never went back to the heroin laced
water we learned in that experience that
it confirms for us that community living
helps with the support system not only
the support system but we couple that
with a systematic approach to treatment
concerning addiction issues of trauma
and life skills when a woman at Ruth&#39;s
house finds herself in a conflict a
trigger we have understood through the
psychology of that what is going on in
her mind the right-hand side of our
brains is our emotional center it takes
a picture of everything that you have
ever done in your entire life
never forgets it and immediately
connects it to an emotion our left-hand
side of our brain is our cognitive
center how we learn to problem-solve
make bacon and eggs those kinds of
things well what happens when we&#39;re
under we&#39;re having a trigger we&#39;re in
conflict is our right brain swallows up
our left brains ability to process and
problem-solve so what do we do with that
we sit the girl down and whoever might
be involved with that particular trigger
that conflict we have them all together
sometimes it&#39;s the entire community that
talks with them and so we help them to
stay in that emotion in that memory at
the same time that we&#39;re helping them to
ground and know that they&#39;re safe and
they&#39;re in a safe place and what happens
then is really remarkable the two halves
of a brain connect and healing happens
every single time we are able to bring
that about more and more in our heads
and our hearts get healed we are so
excited about that because when we come
to a place of healing it helps us to be
more focused on the things that we need
to do recovery work or parenting it
helps us to do life skills learn how to
do them and by doing so we have found
that it just increases their ability to
remain in recovery everyone has been
affected by substance abuse those who
have not but don&#39;t use and those who do
through community living we have found
that we can restore family relationships
we can help people begin to be restored
themselves and they begin to be
productive members of their communities
connected to their communities and they
begin to thrive they&#39;re happier they&#39;re
healthier
they get to live the life that they were
created to live when a woman comes to
Ruth&#39;s house oftentimes she has only the
shoes on her feet and the clothes on her
back but through the grace of God when
they walk out the door they&#39;re healed
and they know that they are fully known
fully loved and fully accepted thank you
so much
