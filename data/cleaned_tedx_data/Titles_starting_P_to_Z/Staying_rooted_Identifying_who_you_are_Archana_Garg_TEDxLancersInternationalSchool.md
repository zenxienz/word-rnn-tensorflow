how hard has the colonial hangover hit
us how deep has been the impact of 200
years of slavery on us Indians that
Ganga became Ganges Karen became karma
and Indians became an Greece India for
decades has been known for its rich
cultural heritage and moral values but
if we ask ourselves are we capable
enough to be known that way a land where
people shed their blood and sacrifice
their lives just so that the future
generations could call themselves proud
Indians so that everyone could live
together in harmony so that the real
meaning of culture would be known to all
but I don&#39;t see that that is the case
today we have forgotten our culture it&#39;s
quite funny that when we greet each
other it&#39;s usually not within a mistake
but with a Hello
and instead of respecting our elders and
valuing our relationships we tend to
give greater importance to our ego and
self pride and these things are doing us
no good instead instead this is what we
see then something that our culture
hasn&#39;t taught us the Indian culture says
that we need to love everyone by first
accepting them the way they are our
culture taught us that we need to be
tolerant towards the end elderly and
respect them no matter what our opinion
is but we tend to pretend that we are
very modernized and we fail to know this
fact that modernization and culture can
go hand in hand and this is where we
lack and all this is caused because we
are drifting away from our language and
it is only the language that connects
one to the culture so the equation we
know today
that Hindi equals to downmarket
something we don&#39;t want to use in our
daily conversations something that is
not going to place us any higher in the
other person&#39;s list of intelligence on
the other hand English equals to success
something it just seems that having a
good command over English is as if
you&#39;ve been given a guaranteed password
to success but that is not the case that
is how we know everything I agree that
being fluent at English is very
important especially in today&#39;s
modernized world today&#39;s globalized
world it is very important but then that
doesn&#39;t mean that we forget our own
language language was meant to connect
us language was meant so that we can all
connect together by expressing our
thoughts by communicating what we are
feeling how we are feeling but this is
not what is happening today I&#39;ll give
you my example I chose Hindi literature
over English literature in IB as a part
of the literature curriculum and this
one decision of my life seemed as if I
was answerable to so many questions
I was literally bombarded with questions
and I was really shocked as I saw
people&#39;s expressions as I saw people
react to my decision they they pretended
that it was something very unusual but
why why does it mindset still exist
in my mind the changes pretty sure&#39;s
brought about in a society at that point
of time for sure have changed our
perceptions in today&#39;s world secondly
the biggest mistake of my life we have
started measuring intelligence based on
the language we know - the means of
language it is often perceived that a
person who has a greater command has a
better command over the English language
is brighter but do we think so do you
think so we&#39;ve also started measuring
status symbol as a part of as
through language a person who has a
higher status in society it demands that
person to know the language a language
of English well but why so and thirdly
obviously job prospects it is our it is
the overall society it&#39;s the perception
of the society that if we have a good
command over English we are going to get
a job for sure and that too very easily
and very sadly and unfortunately that is
actually true to some extent this is
because our society values language more
than our actual skills which is not at
all good it&#39;s not benefiting us so I
just wanted to see if everyone shares
the same perception as me and I
conducted a survey in my neighborhood
this is what I found I asked the school
going children that do you remember the
Hindi alphabets and 100% of them said no
they know the eh-2-zed but they don&#39;t
know koko burger and we call ourselves
Indians then I went to the office going
the working-age people and I asked them
then in which language do you conduct
your business meetings and almost eighty
three point three percent people said
they do it through the means of language
English and only sixteen point seven
percent people said that they do it
through Hindi and lastly I went to the
elders of a society I went to these
senior citizens of for society and I
asked them that do you think that the
younger generation today is drifting
away from their own culture do you think
that the impact of westernization and
modernization has been such that we
don&#39;t care about a language and a
culture anymore and they said yes in
fact 100 percent of them said yes all of
them said yes so I got to I basically
can prove myself right now this is a
proof to where I&#39;m staying
another example let&#39;s see this mouth
the green areas here like USA Canada
Alaska Australia United Kingdom these
places are the places where English is
spoken as the first language it is
spoken as an official language and it&#39;s
very common over there but a few see
places such as India Bangladesh Pakistan
and some regions in Africa then you can
see that this these are the places where
English is widely spoken but not as the
national language it&#39;s just an official
language there and I was really
surprised by this because even I felt
that if we have a good command over
English then that means that success and
our success and our growth is obviously
there for sure it&#39;s for sure that we&#39;re
going to succeed in life but this map
got me thinking China it&#39;s one of the
biggest manufacturing hubs in the world
and they have promoted the culture so
much to that extent that Mandarin
Chinese is the most widely spoken
language over the globe it has more
speakers than the language English does
so have they failed
did they not bro I&#39;ll give you another
example if you see countries such as
Japan and Germany in such less in such a
short span of time they have grown so
much they have gained so much of growth
so much of development because as a part
of the culture they&#39;ve come together
they have united they have joined hands
so that they can see their economy
growing and blooming this is what
culture does not English and I asked
some of my Japanese and Korean friends
and I was startled I was shocked to hear
from them that in their country business
meetings are conducted in their own
mother tongue and not in English most of
them
now you must be thinking that why am I
even standing here promoting Hindi
what&#39;s the use it&#39;s not even spoken in
the southern part of India and not even
in the northeast part of India what am I
even doing here wasting my time no what
I think is that Hindi because it&#39;s a
mother tongue it basically preserves our
identity and it gives a sense of
belongingness to us we are social
animals we need a place to belong we
need somewhere to connect and culture
gives you that place wherein you&#39;re not
judged according to your in terms of
your colour in terms of your Creed in
terms of you cast your just few you are
part of that culture and you get the
sense of belongingness culture is
something that bridges gaps it basically
connects everyone but then if we want to
connect through culture we have to know
our language and that is why Hindi is
important the second reason is that
keeping in touch with our ancestral
roots is very important because we
cannot respect our culture or our
country till the time we don&#39;t know its
history and its past so it is very
important that we know our history and
our past so that we can connect to our
culture and if we cannot even respect
our culture then how can we respect our
language how can we respect our people
and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m wrong to say
this but I think that India the major
obstacle in its growth is the fact that
we&#39;re not United it&#39;s the fact that we
judge each other in terms of how well we
know English but that shouldn&#39;t be the
reason that shouldn&#39;t be the case so I
have a couple of questions for you in
which language did he first learn to
speak was it your own mother tongue if
you&#39;re not a native american or a
Britisher then out then this question is
for you was it your mother tongue or was
it your language English
thank you so much and how do you learn
the language English then school okay
yeah Spanish I had Spanish somewhere
there so it basically means that we use
our own mother tongue to translate and
to learn the new language usage which is
English a second language of foreign
language for us it is very surprising
that India which is the land to almost
22 major languages we cannot find a
language that connects all of us because
we&#39;re just running after English we
cannot find a language that bridges all
our gaps we cannot find a language when
we can say that we&#39;re proud Indians we
all are united we are one we don&#39;t have
that language we don&#39;t have any culture
like that and it is often it is a funny
thing
if someone says I&#39;m a proud Indian it&#39;s
considered a joke this is what we&#39;re
doing to our culture this is what we&#39;re
doing now you must be thinking that I&#39;m
against English but that is not the case
English is very important in today&#39;s
globalized world we need to communicate
our thoughts to each other we need to
know the English language so that we can
communicate with people who are not
native speakers as for own mother tongue
we do right but then again the right
equation is this that we shouldn&#39;t
forget the language which has come from
a mother&#39;s womb this is the right
equation that Hindi equals to our crown
and English equals to our sky now what I
mean through this is that English should
be language which fuels growth which
fuels personal development English
should take us to Heights but then Hindi
is needed as a ground every person needs
a ground to fall on every person is the
ground to stand on we need a ground we
need a base we can&#39;t just dive up to the
heights without a ground and then that
ground is provided by your culture
your language so this is the right
equation in my opinion and I would like
to end my talk by saying that don&#39;t
forget your small home in this huge
world connect with your people connect
with the world connect with everyone
will or your build all your gaps bridge
all your bridges just become one respect
your culture respect your country
respect your language because that is
something that should be the most
important thing to us because it&#39;s us I
am an Indian that&#39;s my identity if we
lose that identity then I don&#39;t know I
think we&#39;re going to lose ourselves
thank you
