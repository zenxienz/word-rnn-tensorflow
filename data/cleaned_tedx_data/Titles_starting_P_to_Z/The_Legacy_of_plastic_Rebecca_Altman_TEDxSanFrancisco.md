Plastics run in my blood in the 1960s in
the decade before I was born when my
father was half the age that I am now
he made plastics for the Union Carbide
and he made it here at this factory
which was set out along the Raritan
River in central New Jersey its waters
flowed east towards the waters outside
New York City now this wasn&#39;t just any
factory this was the flagship factory
for the production of bakelite bakelite
being not the first plastic but the
first synthetic plastic the first
plastic made from the derivatives of
fossil fuels bakelite was invented in
1907 by the chemist leo baekeland in a
backyard laboratory in Yonkers New York
and it was used to make things like car
accessories and telephones and radio
casings but in 1940 when my dad was born
plastics was hardly even a household
name you could even say he grew up
alongside plastics
World War two had started and that was
an engine for research and development
so many new materials came online during
the war and it set the stage for
plastics production to leap at the war&#39;s
end now my father went into chemical
engineering studying in the late 1950s
early 60s and though he would go on to
become a plastics maker he could not
take a course in plastics plastics was
still too new and so he had to learn
that on the job he started working in
the polystyrene division at that Factory
in 1962 so he had a a buzz cut a new
crop of ties the twist was on the radio
Rachel Carson had just published Silent
Spring soon
Martin Luther King would deliver his I
had a dream speech and Kennedy would be
shot and Union Carbide his factory would
celebrate on the pages of the New York
Times being the first company ever to
produce a billion pounds of plastic in a
single year by 1966 he was in charge of
the polystyrene division he was still in
his 20s and was in charge of a unit that
could put out 8,000 pounds of
polystyrene Palpa pellets an hour 24
hours a day seven days a week
most days of the year he gave me this
tally sheet where he had calculated the
cost of a single pound of polystyrene in
the 60s it cost the company twelve cents
to make a single pound of polystyrene
which is important because this was the
era of mass plastics and the era in
which it became conceivable for a
manufacturer good to be disposed of so
when he first started out he was making
polystyrene for things like refrigerator
liners but by the later end of the 60s
he was making polystyrene that would go
into food packaging that had a
functional lace of like a week and
coffee lids which had a functional life
of a hot cup of coffee
he ended up transferring laterally into
the bakelite division and then he left
plastics altogether right at the time
plastics production was taking off and
when I asked him why did you leave he
said there had to be a higher calling
than this 50 years after he started
making plastics when he was in his 70s I
said to him dad will you take me back to
this Factory he was healthy I had a
chance to go and I was an environmental
sociologist I study the intersection of
biography and environmental history how
is it that I had never studied plastics
before so so he took me and we drove
from New England to New Jersey and we
knew the factory had been shuttered and
we knew it was being demolished but we
didn&#39;t realize it was going to it was
gone and when we turned the corner he
gasped at the sight of the ghost of this
actory we drive around the perimeter
down baekeland Avenue when we pull up to
the back pad locked gates and I lean out
the car window and I shoot this picture
and my dad starts talking about this
place as if it was a living entity and
these rail lines as if they were
arteries feeding this plant in goes the
styrene out goes of polystyrene and I
began to think of plastics not so much
as a material but as a network in which
we are enmeshed and of course plastics
was not the only thing this plant made
for any linear production process as
much plastic as is made you can expect
there&#39;s a fair amount of byproducts and
waste product and these would be packed
into 55-gallon drums and drums loaded
onto the back of unmarked trucks and
these two would roll out of these same
gates over these same rails two
destinations unknown and my dad said to
me I used to wonder where it was all
going when I was in grade school there
were headlines from a town about an hour
south of here that about 5,000 drums
that had been produced in the 70s after
he left had been found buried in the
back of an egg farm the farmers had
leased the land not knowing to what
purpose it would be put and the contents
of those drums had leached into the
ground and gotten into the drinking
water and there were kids who were sick
and there were parents who were worried
sick
and there were scientists trying to
figure out the pattern but of course
that&#39;s very complicated science because
there was another Factory and it too had
contaminated the water and it was almost
too much to parse my father and I left
the factory and we drove around this
other dye factory that had contributed
to this contamination and we drove to
that old farm where the being and
carbide wastes had wound up it was a
place you could buy a fence or a used
car but was otherwise unmarked in terms
of what had happened there and how it
had marked that lives of the people had
lived there and then we drove on to the
sea when my father left Union Carbide he
went back to night school he studied
public administration
then he went on to be hired to manage a
small town in North Jersey and there he
founded recycling programs and this was
the man I grew up with the guy who would
pull over the car pick up roadside
litter toss it into the back of his car
there was forever recyclables rummaging
around in the back of his car
awaiting redemption but recycling wasn&#39;t
quite the savior any one of us hoped it
would be if he hoped it would be because
most of the plastic ever made is still
with us and in fact is in the open
environment most of it heads towards
water and their plastic doesn&#39;t break
down into its constituent parts it just
breaks down into ever smaller parts and
the smaller and smaller the pieces the
greater the surface area to absorb other
categories of marine pollutants which
turns out many of them were industrial
chemicals used to modify the performance
of plastics they leached off and then
reunited in the ocean the plastic
attracted them like a magnet attracts
metal and there they begin their
movement through the food web here is a
picture of a plankton filter feeding
polystyrene from there it fans across
the web the food web eventually
returning to us becoming us and the
biological and evolutionary consequences
of this are just coming into view this
past summer a bunch of researchers tried
to get a handle on how much plastic is
in the ocean and so they did a global
accounting of plastics they said since
the 1950s global plastics endured
industry has produced eight point three
billion metric tons of plastic and then
they engage in a series of thought
experiments to put this into the human
context that&#39;s as much as plastic as
could berry New York City two miles deep
but we know that plastics plants produce
more than just plastics and so there&#39;s a
fuller accounting that must be made what
happens to everything else and who lives
among it and so mapping becomes the
corollary to measuring but what about a
place like Toms River New Jersey it
wouldn&#39;t be on any map of a plastics
facility their plastics waste had been
secret away
there&#39;s one more place I want to tell
you about where my dad and I went and
this was on the outskirts of Toms River
now this area the the fall before my dad
and I took this trip had been ravaged by
Hurricane sandy and so there was this
out-of-the-way Park where there was a
cancer Memorial a memorial for all of
the children of Toms River who had died
the park was overgrown the dental office
next door had long been boarded up the
weeds were up to our knees practically
there was literary where but there was
this memorial I started reading the
names of the children who had died
realized the font had changed halfway
through had more children died after the
first had been memorialized my my dad
approaches my memorial
if I know him he is praying and in one
of the strangest coincidences of my life
the wind blows up off the Toms River the
litter is rattling around our feet and -
it delivers to my feet a spent coffee
cup and I pick it up and I look at the
lid and there are those three iconic
arrows chasing each other the recycling
symbol and it is stamped with the
letters PS which tells me that the lid
of the cup that the cancer memorial was
made from polystyrene so what began as a
road trip father/daughter road trip
became I don&#39;t know a pilgrimage a
reckoning a gift where my father had
said to me here these are my
remembrances my truth make of them what
you will make something with them will
you seed the change that needs to come
find a way to leave some alternate
legacy to go along with all of this
indelible plastic and I thought how do
you hold an inheritance like this is
there anything more complicated or
complex than plastics we&#39;re past the
point of easy answers and simple
dichotomy is of good
and bad and innocent and complicit and
life-saving like humanitarian relief and
medical supplies and life altering oh I
came home brimming with questions like
how is it an industrial plant got to
share a name with a botanical one those
great green generous creatures that
supply us with oxygen our life-support
system and so determined to figure this
out I go to the library and I consult
the Oxford English Dictionary you know
that dictionary that spans a whole shelf
and I pull out the P volume and I go to
look up the word plant because I want to
understand where this word came from and
I overshoot and I land on plastics and
there I realized the definition of
plastics goes on for pages which means
this word this concept predates the
material there&#39;s so much richness there
and I&#39;m reminded of the word plasticity
this idea from neurology or psychology
that the mind is wonderfully adaptive
that it&#39;s capable capable of change or
in botany or biology plasticity is the
concept that a species can rapidly
evolve in response to changing
environmental conditions plasticity as a
mechanism of survival and it dawned on
me at this time we&#39;re making more
plastics than ever at this time we&#39;re
more aware at this time plastics we are
more plastic we must become more plastic
more willing to adapt as changing
environmental conditions process this
kind of work is going on all around us
this plasticity of this willingness to
think outside of the box to think
creatively there are cities in the
United States where you can order a
glass of water and it comes with a straw
whether you ask for it or not and then
there are cities that are rethinking
whether this is a critical use of
plastic the changes are happening on
every level from the individual all the
way up to the institutional and then
that middle sweet spot for change where
ideas
and institutions live but there is a
fair amount of resistance there&#39;s a fair
amount of rigidity in the systems by
which we produce consume discard manage
plastics think about that rigidity and
the systems by which we make one of the
most flexible materials humans can make
and why is that rigidity automaticity
unquestioning history would suggest this
makes no sense
let&#39;s think about this generationally so
a human generation is about 25 to 30
years so let&#39;s map this there&#39;s my dad&#39;s
birth year I come along it&#39;s a child of
the 70s I bear children in the 2010 and
let&#39;s throw the year baekeland put
bakelite into mass production 1910
that&#39;s it four generations
we&#39;re four generations in and in that
time plastic has changed again and again
it is the molecular basis of plastics
has changed the material uses of
plastics has changed and even the
cultural meaning of plastics has changed
which is to suggest where where does
such rigidity such automaticity come
such unthinking this come especially
with regards to the use of disposable
plastics as for me I&#39;m not sure where
this whole journey is leading me other
than to say it has changed my career and
I never ever imagined I&#39;d have the
privilege of sharing this stage with all
of you today I do know that plastics
production is set to increase and that
by the time my children are my age
hopefully barring my grandchildren
global production is going to exceed
something like 34 billion metric tons of
plastic and so how do we be this pause
generation that that straddles 20th
century technology and way of doing
things with 21st century legacy 21st
century smarts so that we can tip the
bow
towards light thank you very much for
your time
