silence it&#39;s deafening when you&#39;re the
only one who can hear it I was nine
years old when I first lifted my head
from my pillow and my ears stayed asleep
I woke up in a panic I couldn&#39;t hear the
birds nesting outside my window I
couldn&#39;t hear the alarm clock I couldn&#39;t
hear myself telling myself it&#39;s probably
just a dream because that was the first
time I&#39;d experienced being temporarily
deaf the loss of something often taken
for granted can be isolating and
isolation is deafening it&#39;s even harder
when some days you&#39;re working perfectly
fine and others you have to explain that
no I&#39;m not weirdly staring at your lips
I&#39;m only desperately trying to read what
you&#39;re saying but I can&#39;t understand you
because you don&#39;t move your upper lip
when you speak or you&#39;ll cover your
mouth when you&#39;re doing it it&#39;s hard
when you lose from the best moments to
solitary isolation suddenly you can&#39;t
hear the lecturer in a lesson
the roaring Cal crowds at Glastonbury
the waves crashing it&#39;s the beach
isolation in crowded spaces it&#39;s the
most deafening part of deafness that and
the inconvenience for others I&#39;m
thankfully gifted with the ability to
lip read in part which is really
beneficial for me but sign language as
with all forms of communication differs
greatly from country to country in these
barriers however can solidarity and in
that comes mutual understanding Pamela
rights is a graduate student in
linguistics at California University
Boulder she&#39;s a deaf person and so knows
isolation and fear as many of those with
hard of hearing do
she also recognized these traits in
refugees who are caught up in the
current climates in the United States
right uses her sign language abilities
and a translator to help communicate
with those who can and can&#39;t
- she&#39;s campaigned for access and
education and has a master&#39;s degree in
deaf education to help deaf refugees
develop the skills they need to grow and
learn refugees with disabilities is an
often untapped subject and unheard but
in this comes room for improvement and
with room for improvement comes hope
Wright has been working with tall an
18-yard high school student in Boulder
Tours not much older than myself he&#39;s
also a refugee from Burma his father was
killed by Burmese soldiers something he
witnessed and he spent a number of years
in a refugee camp afraid to use sign
language through fear of persecution
upon arrival in the US he was unknown in
this world
he was so wrought with this fear and so
his lack of verbal communication led to
him being wrongly branded as mentally
deficient signing with tall with a slow
and difficult process but together they
persevered right had to learn Burmese
sign language first from him so it was
an education achievement for them both
after the setbacks in the struggle the
first thing talkin bade to her after his
name base sacred linguistics was the
abhorrent violence that taken place in
his country that he&#39;d seen and hadn&#39;t
been able to hear from there his
communication developed and he was able
to tell his story he was heard and
listened to the first time in the United
States and from that he was set free in
his hope for his new life the refusal to
be reduced by deficiencies and the
ability to build bridges between
communities gives us the perseverance to
continue I know firsthand there was
nothing more relieving than a shared
experience and so reading Pamela
Wright&#39;s work has led me to question
what more I can do to allow the
hard-of-hearing community to understand
the hearing community and vice versa
hence this talk who like me feels left
behind because of communication barriers
who like me was frustrated because of a
lack of understanding as I mentioned
before my deafness is only
so I cannot understand the experience of
a fully deaf person so my understanding
comes in part from experience but also
largely from empathy it seems logical to
me that a member of a community is
better than an outsider at explaining
that community&#39;s needs someone has spent
sense I saw to speak this to other
Outsiders those who can hear but those
who may never have realized there is
such a thing as deaf culture deaf
culture is separate to many other
cultures which are fixed within a race
assigned geographically as one is born
into it without socialization this is
almost unique as it allows that culture
to transcend time period race geography
and gender which in terms of
communication is fantastic for our
concept of what it means to be human if
we can understand communication which is
unaffected by context we can understand
more about the significance
communication has on our lives about 90%
of deaf people are born into hearing
families so they absorb their culture
experiences from their peers not
necessarily their families which is
almost unique Deaf culture placed a
great deal of emphasis on physical
contact
so hugging is far more common and
shaking hands especially when parting
deaf goodbye is usually long and
drawn-out and even in passing not taking
the time to chat for a few minutes can
because it can be considered quite rude
the deaf community easily becomes a
second family for those who are hard of
hearing and British sign language isn&#39;t
simply English with signs added on it
has its own sentence structure grammar
and it&#39;s totally different to other sign
languages like American Sign Language or
Japanese sign language most deaf people
learn their language at specialist
schools like the one in Exeter and which
means that peers and teachers become a
fantastic support network the British
sign language needs to be expanded
beyond into the general population to
help remove barriers and daily
communication just like Pamela helps at
all it&#39;s been really heartening to see
recent numbers on course is accredited
by the institute of british sign
language our increasing government
policy has been changing too so for the
first time british sign language will be
accepted as an alternative qualification
to functional
skills English for apprenticeships so it
means that those who have British sign
language their first language don&#39;t need
to take an English course and then of a
sign language course we had to get their
qualification this means they can get
essential practical skills in maths and
English which help them progress forward
in life this removes the unnecessary
barrier that has been preventing them in
the past recognising and removing
barriers like these is key to helping
move our world thoughts as our existence
as a collective our country is
progressing for those with hearing
impairments we are in a changing world
but these changes are just recent or yet
to be implemented but this is because of
necessary political pressure sign
language wasn&#39;t an officially recognised
language until 2003 and it wasn&#39;t until
March of this year 14 long years later
that it was used in the House of Commons
and so recorded on Hansa which is
official record because those without
hearing are speaking up and finding
their voice systems are changing for the
better
but if we who can hear don&#39;t seek to
listen to such voices change is
impossible one of our general societal
resolutions to a lack of communication
is our participation in our democracy
but this poses its own problems as
minority groups can often feel unheard
in a majoritarian system Helen Keller an
American author activist lecturer and
was the first deafblind person to ever
achieve a degree is alleged to have said
blindness cuts people off from things
deafness cuts people off from people so
encouraging Democratic participation
through using the right to vote through
encouraging pressure groups and allowing
a platform to those who may otherwise
struggle ensures a small yet equal voice
for all in a very large system our
acknowledgement of barriers and our
willingness to elevate the voices of
others is a great importance and we must
do what we can to bridge discrepancies
between we or others have in daily life
whether that be recognizing physical
barriers language and communication
barriers glass ceilings or similar this
insure that we can comprehend
the calls that community is different
from our own faiths will that be because
of ability race sex or otherwise from
this we can grasp the essence of our
changing organic diverse world and be
conscious of how we successfully coexist
together solidarity between minority
groups gives us hope for better and
education can extend the general remit
of our understanding making an effort
whether to understand the needs of
others or to go the step further and
actively seek to learn about their lives
it&#39;s crucial to progress because finding
a friend in a system so much bigger than
yours is the most wonderful thing in the
world right and saw and their work for
deaf refugees shows that despite
barriers in the current political
climates walls are breakable that gives
me hope despite often feeling silenced
right prove that even the most
challenging of language barriers are
able to be overcome and our progress
together through empathy is how we are
changing the world for the better
creating opportunities through
understanding is how we progress forward
because ultimately no one is as deaf as
the one not willing to listen thank you
you
