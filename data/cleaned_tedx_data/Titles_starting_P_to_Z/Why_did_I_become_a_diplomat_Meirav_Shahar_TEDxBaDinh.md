why did I become a diplomat I think that
for me like for many of you the house I
grew in was very influential the home my
father and mother played a critical role
they not only influenced me but they
inspired me I was very lucky my mom was
the feminist she did not call herself a
feminists but she was at the time where
it was not so easy for women to make
their own way to make their own career
she taught me to be independent to
follow my dream to turn challenges into
opportunities
both my parents were immigrants both of
them immigrated to the state of Israel
as very young kids my father immigrated
from Poland in 1935 as a young kid with
his parents don&#39;t forget that Israel was
established modern-day Israel in 1948
and he emigrated in 1935 he came with
his family following their dream the
dream that was shared by many Jews
around the world to make the Land of
Israel into their home a home where they
can be independent and more importantly
where they can be free it&#39;s not easy to
immigrate my mother also immigrated from
Bulgaria
later on she was still a kid with the
same hope with the same inspiration with
the same wish and dream to fulfill their
aspiration to make Israel an independent
country and country where they can live
in really so this is the house I grew in
every day every night knowing that my
parents have worked very hard to cement
the foundation of this new country
don&#39;t forget Israel was a start-up a
real startup with many challenges still
today you needed to be an innovator you
needed to be creative in order to
overcome those challenges and growing up
every day with both my parents this was
their dream but it became part of who I
was it became
I dream as well serving one&#39;s country
it sounds very to us today I think
sometimes corny not very cool but in the
house I grew and it was very fulfilling
because it&#39;s not enough to assist a
country when it&#39;s just being born you
have to work throughout the years
throughout the decades to make sure that
the seeds actually will grow into
something that is more sustainable and I
can tell you that when I did become a
diplomat my father gave me the
declaration of independence Israel&#39;s
Declaration of Independence it&#39;s a
document that contains the Articles that
will guide the way for the new country
why did he give it to me because we
really thought that as a young diplomat
I was young at the time when I started I
should have a guidance something to
guide me in my daily work and I can tell
you that in the office that I work in
and you&#39;re all more than welcome to come
it&#39;s the first thing that I put on my
wall in every mission that I have in
every country that I&#39;ve served it&#39;s the
first thing that goes on the wall it&#39;s
the last thing that I take when I
conclude my mission and I move to the
next post or I move back home so this is
the home I grew in another important
fact about the house I grew in is that
my father and mother were very different
in their political views shocking but
true my father came from the left my
mother came from the right and huge
ideological differences in a young
country that was just being born huge
ideological differences political
economic and also social so everything
that I heard about every political
appearance every economic development
was thoroughly debated at my home I
didn&#39;t think about it much at the time I
have to say as a kid I remember that I
did
not like the arguments so much because
it was constantly about everything but I
can appreciate it as an adult because it
gave me the opportunity to really look
at things from different perspectives
and today is the diplomat I&#39;m able to do
so at some point in life I really wanted
to become a journalist yeah I did not
thought think at that time about being a
diplomat only later in life when I
became a student I thought that becoming
a diplomat would actually be a will suit
me better it will enable me and to serve
better Israel and if you think about it
the reason I wanted to be a journalist
is because that I like going after a
story I like exploring new opportunities
I like meeting new people I like really
looking at what I can do together with
them that&#39;s what I thought I liked about
being a journalist those exposes I had
it in figured out in my head you know
that one day I&#39;ll be famous because I&#39;ve
exposed something and I&#39;ve led to
something by thinking about it you know
being a diplomat has many similarities
also as a diplomat you get to explore
new destinations new cultures new people
you are look for new opportunities look
for good stories good stories in the
sense that it will be good for you for
your country and for the country that
you&#39;re serving in that&#39;s what I do
constantly I&#39;m looking for things that I
can do together
Israel and the country that I&#39;m serving
in as a journalist you want to change
the world that&#39;s what I wanted to do and
I feel that as a diplomat you also want
to change the world you want to make it
a better world you want to assist where
you can certainly you will assist your
own country but once again the country
that you are serving in the project you
are doing the thing that you are doing
together how and why and where can you
change to
and this is one of the reasons I chose
to be a diplomat I joined the Foreign
Service in 1995 and I&#39;ve been doing it
ever since
yeah I have to say that moving every few
years is something that I like as I said
I like challenges and I like looking at
new opportunities and looking and what I
could do together it&#39;s not easy on my
family part of them are here today it&#39;s
not easy and people tend to ndd comments
well you move your tour but being always
the new kid on the block I can tell you
is not easy for them but I&#39;m very very
fortunate that my family believes the
same as I do and we&#39;ve been doing it for
many many years now I started my career
in Kenya Nairobi then I moved also I
served in Los Angeles I served in New
York and in 2012
I came to Vietnam why did I choose to
come to Vietnam so coming to Vietnam for
the first time long before I became a
diplomat was in 1991 I did my military
service in Israel it&#39;s mandatory to go
to the army I did two years in the Air
Force and then after the army we have
this wonderful tradition we go and
travel the world a few months some do it
for a few years and we just go and
travel the world before we settle down
so I chose Asia and I chose to come to
Vietnam in 1991 before we had diplomatic
relations committee Vietnam was an
exotic place that I&#39;ve only read about
mostly about the war that took place in
Vietnam and I wanted to get to know the
people behind the news behind the words
I started in Ho Chi Minh City I remember
when I landed here and I made my way
through all the way to the north I met
wonderful people Vietnam at the time was
very very different from what we all
know today very poor country
and the people in the north were more
closed than the people in the South was
not always easy to make conversation but
I really fell in love with the colors
with the people with the smells with the
food and the months and a half traveling
here low budget low cost it was not
enough was not enough so in 2012 when I
was offered this opportunity I took it
happily once again as I do in every
mission I picked my home my house my
children my husband and of course the
Declaration of Independence and in
August 2012 we moved here I have to say
that the last four and a half years have
been quite a journey a great journey for
me and for my family as well I&#39;ve seen
that the country is going through
changes and I feel that through my work
I was able to be part of some of the
changes that Vietnam is going through I
look at the agriculture sector for
example and the high tech that is coming
to the country more is needed but the
change that the changes that are already
taking place are great and I know that
my country has assisted in it and will
continue to do so I look at the startup
community this is something I&#39;m very
proud you know when I came in August
2012
very few people spoke about startups
even fewer really understood what they
started means and through the work we&#39;ve
done many players in the international
community not only us not only Israel
but I knew that Israel is a leader in
the startups in the world the country
that has built a very special ecosystem
can assist Vietnam in building its own
ecosystem and indeed policies had have
been formulated in the last few years
but what is really great to see is the
younger generation the startups they
started pissed themselves that are
daring too
follow their dream to look they look at
the challenges they turn it into
opportunities and some succeed some
don&#39;t desire this this is the story of
the startups but it&#39;s great to see these
changes I will be leaving very soon and
a couple of months I will be concluding
and five years here almost five years
once again I&#39;ll be packing my family my
home my kids my husband and the
declaration of course of Independence it
will come last and I really feel proud
of the years that I&#39;ve spent here the
people I met with the project that
through my work I was able to implement
together both for Vietnam and from
Israel I feel inspired here and
hopefully I did contribute to the
changes that Vietnam is going through I
will be moving to a new assignment
following my dream looking for
challenges and opportunities in my next
assignment as well and following the
dream of my parents which became my
dream to represent Israel and to make
sure that the seeds that were planted
many years ago actually continue to grow
so thank you very much this is my story
thank you very much
you
