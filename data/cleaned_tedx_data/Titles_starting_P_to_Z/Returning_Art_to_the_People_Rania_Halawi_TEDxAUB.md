have you seen this garden before okay so
this is the Rena Watson aya garden it&#39;s
one of the biggest and oldest gardens
and mostly well-preserved garden in
Beirut on October 5th in 16 there was a
public event there twenty four artists
displayed their artworks in the garden
and more than 50,000 visitors these two
ladies used to be there on a daily basis
at the same hour each day just sitting
and looking one day I overheard their
conversation the eldest lady was telling
the other one what is this are people
looking at what&#39;s all this stuff they
have foot so the other lady told her
apparently it&#39;s called art it&#39;s meant to
be looked at touched and enjoyed mmm
said the eldest I still don&#39;t understand
but I like having this in my garden and
people seems happier when looking at
this stuff anyway now we have a new
thing to talk about everyday net for a
July women are really online is a new
machine what is art
is it only to look at does it have to be
beautiful
expressive original intellectual or does
it uplifting or does it have to be
enjoyable following on these questions
we seem to be faced with lots of
question marks can art contribute to
improve the world can it help change
mentalities can we still make art at an
age of political transformation well a
two-year long study published last month
by the University of Pennsylvania proved
that there is a log definitely a link
between arts and culture and social
well-being especially in less advantaged
areas
Michelle buyer from the New York
Community Trust stated arts and culture
are a vibrant and essential part of a
healthy thriving community house art in
the Middle East you have the art scene
that consists of artists galleries
museums curators definitely art
collectors and the arts lovers or what
we call consumers what about the others
do they visit galleries or museums do
they even look at graffiti do they own a
painting or an artwork
where are the others and this is the
question that my associates run at a bar
area for hat and myself found to be very
essential there is a lack of public art
11 why do we have to travel to look and
feel and see public art why don&#39;t we
have at 11 this is where we have started
a non-profit cultural organization
called
art and motion it&#39;s meant to move art
into unconventional public spaces where
people or the population feel more at
ease and in their comfort zone our
mission vision and goals are mainly to
reach Lebanese from different
socioeconomic backgrounds to reinforce
earth as a medium of empowerment
exchange and dialogue generate
conversations revive public spaces etc
Yemen and rabiyah are 210 years old
children who usually visit the garden
and they were there at the time when the
artists were putting together their
artworks they were very curious and they
wanted to be to engage so they asked the
artists and they could help and the
artists agree while working with the
artists they asked many questions what
is art
why do you do what you are doing how can
art make our world more beautiful
at the end when the artwork was finished
Yemen and rabiyah were extremely proud
and they called on passing boys telling
them come come see our arts ok so the
engagement was was there the interaction
with the public was there we had a
workshop about Arabic calligraphy and
people were extremely engaged so you see
one hand cannot clap alone ok we need to
create awareness we need you all of you
everyone we need even more initiatives
like art and motion to make it happen ok
and Louise Bourgeois a French American
sculptor and artists based her life work
and career on the sentence art is a
guarantee of sanity so let&#39;s make it
together
let&#39;s guarantee our sanity thank you
