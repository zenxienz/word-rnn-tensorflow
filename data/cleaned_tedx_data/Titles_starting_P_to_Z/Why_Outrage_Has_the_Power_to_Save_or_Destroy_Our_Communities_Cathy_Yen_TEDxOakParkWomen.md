one day I woke up and realized that I
was the bad guy demonized vilified in my
own community unfriended on Facebook
shunned at the block party pointed at at
the grocery store my crime was this I
stood up I said something publicly
something unpopular that went against
the crowd in my small town and I also
learned that years of residency
philanthropy hard work reputation oh
that doesn&#39;t buy you the benefit of the
doubt these days does it
uh-uh you say one thing one thing that
goes against the crowd in your small
town and you are met with outrage we&#39;re
feeling it everywhere in small towns all
across America we&#39;re facing outrage
we&#39;re angry with each other and sure I
understand national politics but how is
that a role model how is it that we&#39;re
feeling we have to do this right here at
home if there&#39;s an issue we immediately
jump to one side or the other based on
labels what our friend said how many
likes it got rarely on facts or
researcher even good old curiosity no we
don&#39;t even want to listen if we don&#39;t
already agree in fact we don&#39;t even want
those people around here anymore get
them out of here
well let me tell you as someone who&#39;s
been told to get out of here
it&#39;s pretty awful it feels really bad to
be told by your community that you don&#39;t
belong here because of who you are or
what you said now I happen to represent
small businesses in a very progressive
town which can feel like we&#39;re in a big
Scarlet Letter right I have a C for evil
capitalist years of experience in large
corporate business in small business and
nonprofits none of that prepared me for
the outrage I would feel right here at
home
from people I know because of something
I did for my work something I believed
in outrage that&#39;s personal that&#39;s
vindictive that tells you you got to get
out of here and it&#39;s effective
it feels like middle school you start to
go you know alright maybe they&#39;re right
maybe I don&#39;t belong here anymore maybe
I need to sit down and be quiet because
I&#39;m obviously not having a good impact
and then I said you know what wait a
minute uh-uh this is my community too
it&#39;s all of our community I love my
community I love the values we stand for
sure every once in a while I&#39;m on the
minority side but the next time I&#39;m on
the minority side you&#39;re gonna hear
about it because I&#39;m not afraid of
outrage anymore and I don&#39;t want you to
be either in fact tonight I&#39;m not here
to end outrage I&#39;m here to reclaim it
there are two kinds of outrage the good
kind and the bad kind the bad kind the
negative outrage what I call not you get
out of here that&#39;s just mean that&#39;s just
bullying but the other kind the good
kind me too inclusionary that&#39;s how we
got here that&#39;s what founded our country
that kind of outrage is what we saw in
the pilgrims in the colonialists in the
Pioneers the immigrants even people in
towns like mine people who 150 years ago
came from Chicago to here to build a new
world a world based on values and things
they believe in that&#39;s who we are
that&#39;s the American Way we get outraged
we protest and then we fix it that kind
of outrage is how we start that process
of going from outrage to action to
outcome in outrage everyone gets a voice
me too something&#39;s wrong we gotta fix
this let&#39;s come together in action we
deliberate we do we determine decide and
then we come to an outcome a decision
but more than a decision an informed
choice that takes everything we heard an
outrage
everything we learned in action and
everything we need to make a better
world for our neighbors our friends our
children but we&#39;re stuck aren&#39;t we we&#39;re
stuck in that outrage we&#39;re stuck in
that not you cycle I don&#39;t want to hear
what you have to say you don&#39;t want to
hear what I have to say I&#39;m outraged
you&#39;re outraged over it there be an
outrage to both of us we can&#39;t get out
of it we can&#39;t get out of this negative
cycle this negative cycle is destroying
us and it&#39;s splitting us apart and
frankly do we really need any help
splitting ourselves apart I don&#39;t think
so
that&#39;s human nature as it is every group
of human beings is going to split itself
into smaller and smaller groups we want
to be around people were comfortable
with so we find ourselves seeking out
like-minded people in fact the research
will show that Americans have been doing
this all over the United States for the
past 50 years we&#39;re mobile were
prosperous we want to be around people
just like us so we moved to communities
of people just like us the progressive
communities are becoming more
progressive and the conservative
communities are becoming more
conservative in my own town of Oak Park
Illinois were very progressive we&#39;re
very proud of our lawn signs that say
hate hath no home here and that&#39;s great
but outraged indignation tolerance
that&#39;s living in the guest bedroom
because liberals aren&#39;t so liberal about
people who aren&#39;t liberal right right
[Applause]
does anybody seen a Republican yard sign
in their neighbor&#39;s yard right outrage
more outraged about that than the entire
Republican County ten miles away
it&#39;s the dissenters right here at home
that trouble us most who&#39;s that guy
how&#39;d he get in here who let him into
our bubble bubble indeed right we&#39;re
actually kind of proud of our bubble
here in Oak Park got a lot of values
pretty proud of what we stand for what
we don&#39;t realize is that the choices we
have to make to make these values happen
start to cause problems with
prioritization with resource allocation
and those values were so proud of they
don&#39;t even play well together let me
show you what I mean affordable housing
is a very important value to us but so
is increasing our property values as
homeowners don&#39;t we want to see a sell
at the highest price we feel very
strongly about our public schools our
outstanding public education but we do
everything we can to lower our taxes
even though the taxes pay for the
schools we&#39;re really proud of our
historical commitment to diversity but
we treasure our friends and when you
look at our friends they look just like
us we love our parks our green space but
we also understand that growth and
density are critical to our success so
we have to maximize the built
environment we feel strongly about clean
energy sustainability the environment
but the thing that outrages us most is
finding parking for our SUVs right we&#39;re
very concerned about making sure we&#39;ve
got that walkable lifestyle we love our
urban lifestyle and the trendy outdoor
cafes and then we work really really
hard for disability access forgetting
that those wheelchairs can&#39;t really get
around those trendy outdoor cafes we
feel strongly about our independent
businesses the character they bring but
who&#39;s not giddy when a national brand
comes in yeah
right we feel really good about health
care affordable health care is a right
not a privilege but we really want
choice because we&#39;re not always so
comfortable when we have to go to the
emergency room in the community hospital
that also serves the inner city we feel
that public transportation is critical
to how we&#39;re going to live on this earth
but we wearily were we really worry
about development especially in areas
near public transportation because we&#39;re
afraid of congestion and traffic we love
the big city we love being on the west
side of Chicago but we&#39;re a little bit
nervous about Chicago being on the east
side of Oak Park so we build okay we
build barriers all along our border to
keep the city we love out of our town we
believe in equity we believe in
opportunity for all but we&#39;re
competitive we really really really
believe in individual achievement that
equities stuff that&#39;s great as long as
my child gets every advantage and we
believe in the American Dream we teach
entrepreneurial ism in our schools we
treasure our small business people as
long as they can meet every single
progressive ideal tax regulation and
charitable donation requests that we put
on them and if they don&#39;t if they say
I&#39;ll job creation or some such thing we
will protest them and pick at them and
boycott them just like we would do if
any one of these twenty four values were
threatened and if everyone still with me
yeah I said twenty four that was twenty
four values in one three square mile
community and I&#39;m just getting warmed up
right right to be here all night
every single one of these values is
important important to me important to
my community but when you lay them out
all together who can make sense of them
how do we make choices how do we make
decisions ensure if one of these is
really important to you you&#39;re gonna get
behind your value and you&#39;re gonna fight
for it but if you move over into that
knot you kind of outrage take that to
its logical conclusion now I&#39;ve got 24
bands of outraged people running around
town affordable housing is more
important than jobs jobs are more
important than equity equity is more
important than health care and health
care is more important than affordable
housing
it&#39;s one big cycle we can&#39;t get out of
it
and here&#39;s the thing you don&#39;t like what
I said about I don&#39;t know affordable
housing or whatever fine I&#39;m out of here
good luck with health care and job
creation and me helping you out I&#39;m one
of the 20 some-odd values we do agree
upon this is how we have to get out of
this cycle we have to build consensus
and move forward and we can do it we&#39;ve
done it in the past women&#39;s rights civil
rights rotaries efforts to end polio
across the globe the stop sign at the
end of your block these are all the
result of people getting outraged and
working together to fix it we can do
this you&#39;ve already taken the first step
with me there&#39;s me two outraged and
there&#39;s not you outraged the me too
that&#39;s gonna get us there but even the
good kind of outraged it&#39;s not action
outraged action outcome three different
phases outrage is inspirational it
builds awareness action is
transformational outrage honors values
what&#39;s important emotion action data
facts analysis our age gives us voice
action gives us choice and nothing will
change if you don&#39;t get outraged but
outraged alone that&#39;s not going to
change anything the real change comes
from action the real change comes from
us coming together to change
institutions systems laws culture people
x5
patience and we know about change right
change is hard people don&#39;t like change
people are afraid of change that&#39;s why
this inclusionary process is so
important when you bring everyone along
from the outrage to the action you have
a fighting chance at fighting that fear
real change doesn&#39;t come from the elites
with their spreadsheets real change
comes from the community building
consensus that&#39;s why the process matters
the process matters a lot everyone gets
a voice even when you think you know it
they&#39;re gonna say let them say it anyway
let them say it anyway look it&#39;s
probably not going to change the
decision every time but it&#39;s going to
change the process it&#39;ll change the
process into one that&#39;s inclusionary
democratic leaves everyone feeling heard
and with any luck leaves everyone
feeling vested in the outcome that kind
of process is what can change the world
and if you&#39;re in the minority don&#39;t sell
yourself short you might move that
needle just a little bit just enough to
make that outcome change to make life
better for those we would otherwise have
left behind keep talking if you&#39;re in
the minority even when they say you&#39;re
the bad guy or you&#39;re the bad guy or
you&#39;re the bad guy the bad guy can still
make a difference the bad guy can still
have an impact so don&#39;t walk out that
door don&#39;t walk out and leave your
community wondering what&#39;s on your mind
raise your hand let them know we can&#39;t
change they&#39;re not you outraged but oh
he can fight back with me too it takes
you mental humility courage and a
willingness to be vulnerable but that
kind of outrage that can change the
world we all have the tenacity to
outlast the outrage I know we do and
when you cross that bridge from outrage
to action when all of a sudden now
you&#39;ve got your seat at the table reach
out even when you&#39;re looking eye to eye
with the person who just tried to get
rid of you don&#39;t worry about it
it wasn&#39;t about you anyway they were
afraid for their values
come together build that consensus
because that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get us
through the path if we took everyone
from outrage to action it&#39;s going to be
okay our outcome it&#39;s going to be okay
so by all means get outraged raise your
hand tell us what&#39;s going up going on
tell us what&#39;s on your mind tell us what
has to be fixed by all means get
outraged and change the world because
like-minded people don&#39;t always agree
people who are passionate they get
outraged and that&#39;s okay
the good kind of outrage the kind of
outrage that brings everyone aboard
channel it embrace it
use that outrage as the powerful tool it
really is to drive us towards collective
action and better outcomes for a better
world for all of our communities and our
country
thank you
