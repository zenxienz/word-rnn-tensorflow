hey everybody I&#39;m gonna speak about an
industry which is basically developed
very fast in the past couple of years
and this is an industry of 60 billion
dollars now and basically this is an
industry which is based on trust but
before I dig deeper into crowdfunding
I&#39;d like to tell a little how I became a
kind of crowdfunding expert maybe this
strategy will be useful for a couple of
people as well in here so it all started
three years ago when I watched the
random video on YouTube of one guy who
was explaining how he sold his car wash
business and went to digital marketing
he was a graduate of animal husbandry
University with a specialization on
gorillas and he was in the car wash
business for more than 20 years so he
sold his business went into digital
marketing and suddenly in a very quick
period of time he became one of the best
internet marketing specialists in the
world I found that that story
fascinating and it basically changed my
life so I quitted my job and decided to
become an expert in the internet
marketing area as well I I wanted to
focus on crowdfunding because
crowdfunding was the emerging industry
at that time and so my strategy was very
simple I had to just interview about 50
people who succeeded before in
crowdfunding and asked them two simple
questions what worked in crowdfunding
and what didn&#39;t worked and suddenly I
came up with like more than 100 very
useful and very effective ideas and
strategies which I wrote down carefully
analyzed them and went to another guy
the fifty first one who was struggling
at that time and I said hey well you
know I&#39;m kind of expert in the
crowdfunding and I can help you in here
and I can give you a very practical
strategist which will be useful for the
campaign of course he was very very
reluctant at that time to receive advice
from somebody who had never done these
kind of things before but I managed to
kind of convince him
and and to my great surprise it worked
and he managed to raise the amount of
money that he was aiming to at the time
so I was more than happier than he was
at the time and I published that that
ideas into a book and put it on Amazon
and again to my great surprise it became
a best-seller in the crowdfunding
category of Amazon so this is how I
entered into the field and I started to
receive many inquiries from all the from
people from all over the world and
started to dig deeper into crowdfunding
so what is crowdfunding well as the name
implies crowdfunding is raising money
from big a big number of people small
amount of now offer money from big
amount of people as the name implies
like money from the crowd but the
concept is not new and existed way
before and even you know such famous
structures as a felt hour and the
Liberty stages were finest using
crowdfunding mechanism but crowdfunding
really emerged in the past couple of
years due to the emergence of internet
and became very popular crowdfunding
bring to life a lot of technological
innovations that we currently use such
as SmartWatch oculus rift although this
pebble pebble guys are not in the
business anymore but basically they
introduced the smarter to the world and
usually crowdfunding is associated with
technological innovations and
technological advancement but it&#39;s not
not always the case if you have an idea
which solves a very apparent and very
apparent problem which has a mass market
you can definitely go to crowdfunding
and create a global business with it for
example one of our projects was created
by one guy from United States who was a
father of four children so and in the
United State is not like in Armenia
fathers participate in the diaper
changing activities of their children
much much more so this guy suddenly
noticed his children put their hands in
a place where they shouldn&#39;t be
during this diaper changing procedure
and he came up with the like very handy
barrier which is this so which basically
you see which prevents the children to
reach to the to this emerging points so
he created this project this project
raised 120 thousand dollars one hundred
twenty thousand dollars with no
blockchain no VR no internet of thing no
without without these fancy words
and he became a local hero he was
invited with a lot of TV shows I think
once CNN was invited him and he was
going and the children were put it in
there and he was like explaining
everybody how how his invention works
so he quitted his job he became he
created a global business with this
technology with like very simple area
you can see it&#39;s like kind of piece of
fabric but it solves a very apparent
problem so crowdfunding is can be can be
used for everybody everyone and it
creates a platform by eliminating the
middleman like banks venture capitalists
other other businesses which you might
refer to and it it creates an
opportunity for everyone to work with
the trust which basically speeds up the
process much more so now this is a 60
billion dollar industry which is
basically backed by trust and this is a
win-win situation for all the parties
because creators understand if they are
honest and transparent enough they will
get the money
produce their products and there they
have a great chance to create a global
business and they will benefit much more
than the amount of money and Baker&#39;s
understand that if they trust to these
creators they will get great innovations
for a fraction of a price with much
sooner than everybody else can I take
the money and run away this is the
question that I get most of the time and
this seems to really very attractive to
a lot of people who heard for the first
time about crowdfunding and the answer
is yes you can but you shouldn&#39;t because
if you do a lot of people from all over
the world will try to find you whatever
nickname you
they will find you I can assure you and
you&#39;ll basically forget about online
business and a lot of very powerful
journalists will also find you and write
articles negative articles about you and
warn people to stay away from you so and
basically you will sacrifice 99 other
benefits that I found very useful and
for each of these benefits it is worth
to go to crowdfunding first it&#39;s a
market research for a very quick short
of time you create a really good market
research imagine the alternative way you
would go to business you&#39;ll spend a lot
of money or you&#39;ll have you should hire
a sociological company to create a good
research for you and it would be very
expensive but in crowdfunding you very
quickly understand the will your project
will take off or not even very big
corporations using crowdfunding for for
market research to understand whether
their products there are new inventions
have potential or not it&#39;s a great
feedback these Baker&#39;s people who
provide provide you donations there are
no similar customers they&#39;re kind of
your team members and they are very
concerned and interested to provide you
better feedback to provide you good
advice and with our recent project we
got so many valuable advices that we
even didn&#39;t think of with our team and
we put aside our thoughts and
implemented the ones that we got from
our Baker&#39;s this is pre-orders of course
for any hardware business this is a
great thing this is a PR a lot of truly
lists are very keen to cover
crowdfunding stories it is very hard for
a typical business to enter into these
big publications like Forbes measurable
I don&#39;t know TechCrunch but journalists
refer to people who are in crowdfunding
is a little bit different to them
crowdfunding is full of human inspiring
stories this is a great loyalty a lot of
companies spent number of years and
resources to gain this kind of loyalty
that you can get within a couple of
months these these people as I said they
are they&#39;re you your team members and
they will buy whatever you do in the
in the next in your next projects this
is a word of mouth a lot of people will
share your project and create a lot of
buzz around you this is a partnership
offers of course it might not be your
primary offer but I can assure you that
with the successful crowdfunding
campaign you will get so many offers
from all over the from partners from all
over the world like retailers suppliers
wholesalers and anything else we got
like round from 300 to 500 offers from
many people these are your customers and
this is a very good confidence towards
investors successful crowdfunding
campain is a kind of proof of concept
otherwise if you go to investors it&#39;s
very subjective
it&#39;s up to them they think it will work
or it will not work but if you have a
successful project you have already
proof of the market you can see that
there is an apparent demand in there and
it becomes very easy to raise another
round of investment after crowdfunding
with our recent project we raised 1.2
million dollars from 135 countries
within a very short period of time and
there were even three countries I never
heard of and all these people trusted us
without freezing our bank accounts
without asking their lawyers to call us
and Cl is everything ok or not they just
trusted us without know that knowing us
personally and trust and honesty I
wonder what will happen if trust and
honesty appears wind our win/win factors
in other industries as well like in
politics business or banking thank you
