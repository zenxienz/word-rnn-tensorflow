hello hello my name as I&#39;ve been very
kindly introduces an Apogee ski if
you&#39;re wondering about the spelling of
that the answer is 96 if it&#39;s on a
triple word score I&#39;m here to talk to
you about the future of materials
because I&#39;m a material scientist give me
two if you&#39;ve heard of material science
okay don&#39;t worry that usually happens
with several sizes we basically we look
at stuff and that can be any kind of
stuff right the material that makes up
this carpet the foam in the seats that
you&#39;re sitting on the components in
these lights and we zoom in to see what
the atoms are doing inside those
materials and usually these atoms can
tell us what a materials properties are
going to be so that might be its
hardness or its flexibility or its
sharpness my mum is convinced that I
just play rock paper scissors for a
living all day and that is kind of true
and but today I&#39;m going to be talking to
you about the future of materials
specifically smart materials now one of
the most exciting applications of smarty
was that I&#39;ve ever come across is the
pinecone now that doesn&#39;t seem very
smart
Unite&#39;s say but the pinecone is a
remarkable example of a smart material
because it&#39;s made of a material called a
hygroscopic material now this is a
material that absorbs moisture and when
it does that it changes shape it expands
and pine trees have gone through years
of evolution and they&#39;ve worked out that
the best weather to plant a new pine
tree is when it&#39;s hot and dry right when
it&#39;s cold and where pine trees just
don&#39;t like to grow apparently so the
pine trees have developed these pine
cones with this hygroscopic material
which means that when it&#39;s hot and dry
and it&#39;s lovely weather for planting new
pine trees the pine cone is opened out
and the seeds can disperse when it&#39;s
cold and wet then this hygroscopic
material expands and that causes the
spines on the edge of the pine cone to
close up and the seeds conk out so pine
cones are a remarkable example of what
we call it activating smart material a
smart material that moves in response to
something so the definition then of a
smart material is an object that has a
property
like its color or its shape or maybe
it&#39;s magnetism and this property changes
in response to an external stimulus
which might be light levels or moisture
levels as in the case of the pine cone
temperature pressure that sort of thing
and the what I&#39;m going to be talking to
you about today is some futuristic
examples of smart materials so actuators
are just one example there are other
categories of smart materials as well
color changing materials materials that
can sense heating and cooling materials
self-healing materials and phase
changing which means freezing and
melting and this all sounds very
futuristic I&#39;ve told you I&#39;m talking
about the future but actually smart
materials have been around for a very
long time these are the Pyramids of Giza
they were built four and a half thousand
years ago and actually the lime mortar
the kind of the cement material that
main that makes up these pyramids is
actually self-healing so when a crack
develops in this material it can heal
itself without any kind of human
interaction but the first material to be
recognized as a smart material came in
1880 and it looks like this this is
quartz and the remarkable property was
discovered by the much less successful
and famous husband and brother-in-law -
the only scientist ever to have won two
Nobel prizes in two different subjects
Who am I talking about
shoutout anybody Marie Curie exactly
yeah the Curie brothers they discovered
that two quartz has a remarkable
property called piezo electricity what
this means is that when you squash a
quartz crystal the Curie brothers
discovered that a voltage is syrup
across it and year later they discovered
that the opposite was true as well if
you put a voltage across a quartz
crystal then the material itself
physically deforms not to understand how
materials do this we need to zoom in and
see what atoms are doing so tedx are you
ready to do some material science with
me thank you for your enthusiasm so
let&#39;s see what the after miss doing now
to work out what quartz crystals are
doing the clues kind of in the name
actually crystals right - most people
Crystal&#39;s the word crystals kinda
it draws up an image not too dissimilar
to this one actually kind of glistening
transparent gemstones but actually to a
material scientist crystals are any
materials in which the atoms are all
lined up in neat little rows so metals
are mostly crystals ceramics some
plastics ice rocks all of these
materials for me are crystals okay and
the smallest element of that crystal is
called the unit cell and it&#39;s basically
just a small repeating unit that goes
over and over again in order to make up
this very orderly atomic structure and
in most crystals the unit cell is
symmetrical so it looks the same
back-to-front upside down but in a
piezoelectric material the unit cell is
not symmetrical it&#39;s asymmetrical and
that doesn&#39;t sound very remarkable but
it has this amazing effect because
ordinarily in a quartz unit cell you&#39;ve
got a positive atom next to a negative
atom and these charges just cancel out
usually but if you squash the unit cell
or if you stretch it then these atoms
move a bit and that means for the
asymmetry means that the the positive
and negative can&#39;t now cancel out so
what you end up with is a unit cell that
is slightly positive on one side and
slightly negative on the other and these
charges they&#39;re not particularly strong
we&#39;re talking about electrons here but
if you multiply this effect across the
many many millions of unit cells in a
quartz crystal then what you end up with
is a measurable electric voltage so
these are materials that generate
electricity
if you squash them and you&#39;ll be
familiar with some other materials smart
materials as well for example those the
photochromic sunglasses that go dark
when you go outside those Duracell
batteries that show you how much charge
is left in the battery when you and you
cover it up color-changing mugs and mood
rings you guys know what mood rings are
right young people in the room yeah
mood rings okay notice me and these are
all examples of smart materials that
you&#39;ll know today but one thing you&#39;ll
notice that they&#39;re all quite naff right
like I&#39;ve been talking about amazing
smart materials but these are not
particularly that groundbreaking and I&#39;m
going to come back to the reason why we
don&#39;t have such groundbreaking smart
was around at the moment but an example
of a futuristic application of smart
materials I wanted to speak about today
looks like this okay hang on that
doesn&#39;t actually look that futuristic
does it that&#39;s cuz it&#39;s not actually
this was drawn in 1488 by Leonardo da
Vinci this is Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s flying
machine which he invented and he he
invented it
having been observing been observing the
flights of birds and bats and the wing
shapes because he recognized that again
birds and bats and flying animals have
had millions and millions of years of
evolution in order to inform their
design of wings to make the best and
most efficient wing design so da Vinci
he designed his flying machine by
copying the birds in the bats
and these these wings were flexible they
were jointed they could change shape a
lot in response to the live flight
conditions that the the machine found
itself in but if you if you compare this
flying machine to the wings of the
planes that we will fly around and now
they&#39;re quite different aren&#39;t they our
planes have wings that are fixed okay
there&#39;s a few stiffly movable parts but
really they&#39;re quite rigid and I&#39;m sorry
to tell you but these wings are not the
best wings for flying even though you&#39;ll
fly around with them all the time the
best wings for flying in fact their
wings a constrained shape they can move
in response to what the flight
conditions are doing so in the future
our aircraft are going to look much more
like da Vinci&#39;s design than our current
fixed wings design and that&#39;s all going
to be thanks to smart materials so what
materials then are we going to use well
in da Vinci&#39;s design he had a hard bit
of hard jointed pieces of wood quite a
lightweight material and then he
stretched over it to mimic the skin of
the animal he stretched over a piece of
silk
so in our small aircraft we&#39;re gonna
have the the rigid component it&#39;s gonna
be made of a shape-memory alloy and this
is a metal and it actually remembers the
shape that it was in before it got moved
into a different shape so with our shape
memory alloys we can change the shape of
the wing simply by heating these
materials up the skin of the aircraft is
going to have to be
then both hard and rigid and strong to
withstand the aerodynamic forces in
flight but it&#39;s also going to have to be
flexible in order to be able to
withstand the changing shape of the wing
underneath and smart materials are going
to allow us to be able to do this shape
changing materials like electroactive
polymers and shape-memory polymers are
going to be able to be strong and stiff
at times but then soft and flexible at
times as well just either by being
heated up or by having an electric
current flowing through them and I call
this a skin of the aircraft and actually
going to be more like skin than perhaps
you realize because again with the piezo
electric crystals which we met earlier
or some quite slightly more exotic
sounding quantum tunneling composites
these materials will be able to allow
our aircraft to sense to be able to feel
things because these materials produce a
measurable electric voltage when they
are pressed and finally again it&#39;s going
to be more like a skin than our current
designs because these materials could be
made to be self-healing just like those
Pyramids of Giza were self-healing you
can actually get plastics now which are
able to heal themselves without any kind
of human interaction so if your plane
happens to get a hole in it that&#39;s no
problem even when you&#39;re in the air so
these are some really cool examples of
smart materials but all the ones that
I&#39;ve spoken about just now actually
exist already right you can buy them
most of them on the Internet you can
work with them you can play with them so
why then do we not have da Vinci&#39;s
aircraft working today
well that&#39;s because smart materials
unfortunately have quite a few problems
they&#39;re slow to react so if you wanted
to change the shape of your wing it
might not change as quickly as you like
some of them are too delicate or
unstable to use their performance can
diminish over time which again is not
something you really want to hear if
your aircraft is made out of it
sometimes incorporating them into
working devices can be quite difficult
the switch threshold can be difficult to
control
so the temperature at which it changes
or the pressure at which it changes can
be difficult to control some of them are
too toxic some of them are too expensive
and some of them are just too difficult
to make enough of them in order to make
something useful but the point that I
want to end on
is that these problems are not too
difficult to solve right and material
scientists and engineers are going to be
working on these problems and you guys
are hopefully the material scientists
and engineers are the future that can
solve these problems so I hope you&#39;ll
accept this challenge of joining me in
material science and engineering and
working on smart materials because they
deserve a place in the future and it&#39;s
going to make the future a very exciting
place to be thank you very much for
listening I&#39;ve been producing
