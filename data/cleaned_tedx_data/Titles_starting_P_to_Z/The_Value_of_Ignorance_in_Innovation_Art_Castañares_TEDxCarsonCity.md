in 1792 poet Thomas gray coined the
phrase ignorance is bliss it means that
not knowing something is often more
comfortable than knowing it like how
many calories are in that piece of
chocolate cake you&#39;re going to eat
anyways you just don&#39;t want to know but
people forget that ignorance doesn&#39;t
mean you&#39;re dumb
it means the lack of knowledge or
information not a lack of intelligence
very smart person could be ignorant in
the rules of football for example or
like me I&#39;m ignorant in the strategy of
chess
so my seven-year-old son Charlie who&#39;s
on the chess team at at school beats me
all the time doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re dumb it
means you just are missing some bit of
information that you don&#39;t know but I
argue that ignorant is very powerful and
it can lead to breakthroughs and spawn
innovation when you least expect it my
entire business is sort of by accident
and it&#39;s a testament to the power of
ignorance in innovation I&#39;m the founder
of a green tech company that specializes
in the development of solar energy
projects biofuels technology and
synthetic turf and even though I deal
with these very complex projects every
day I&#39;m not an engineer I&#39;m not a
scientist I&#39;m actually a deal maker well
my job is is to find ways to take these
types of technologies and apply real
business models to them and make them
viable there are a lot of really
interesting inventions out there whether
they&#39;re apps or technology or gadgets
that are really clever very innovative
but their commercial flops they don&#39;t
create any value for a client so
nobody&#39;s going to pay for them my job is
to take these existing business models
and create a project that is sustainable
financeable and has measurable
environmental impacts the entire
business I have sort of came by accident
and I wanted to tell you the story of
three of the things that happened to me
because of my ignorance my first Green
Deal was in 2008 previously I worked for
13 years for the California State
Legislature politics I know
I survived but the last four years that
I worked there I worked in the
California State Capitol and I helped
put together the 100 billion
dollar-a-year annual budget and after I
left all of my friends in government now
think that if I can solve those problems
I can fix any budget so I got a request
for that in 2008 a school district in my
area in San Diego approached me and
asked me if I could help them save money
without firing any teachers or staff and
they handed me their 40 million dollar
budget and I went through it an 87% with
staff it only leaves 13% to find a way
to save money and the single largest
expenditure after staff was electricity
over a million dollars a year and I
thought maybe if I could find a way to
attack that I could create the most
savings and I knew a little bit about
solar having worked in politics you have
to know a little bit about pretty much
everything so I&#39;m a kind of a jack of
all trades and master of none and so I
thought maybe I could figure out a way
to use solar to help them save money at
the time though in 2008 all the solar
projects the pricing was tied to the
price of electricity at the utility
company two months before I was
approached by the school district two
large universities in California had
signed 20-years solar contracts that
saved zero money over time so that
wouldn&#39;t really do anything for this
school district so I started noodling on
it like I always do a couple days later
I was in the shower looking out of the
window and the Sun was just coming up
over the hills and it kind of hit me in
the eye and all of a sudden it made
sense
this wasn&#39;t a technology problem it was
a financing problem and if I could
figure out a way to do another type of
contract that created savings it would
help the district so I jumped out of the
shower barely got dressed sat on my
computer for about three hours working
on spreadsheets which is what I do and I
came up with a model that estimated that
the district could save about 10 million
dollars over the life of the system and
that had never been done so I started
talking to bankers and they thought I
was crazy
started talking to people in the
industry and they thought I was nuts and
I was embarrassed
and I felt dejected that this idea that
I had this seemed so logical
just didn&#39;t work and the biggest insult
came when I went to see a very savvy
financier in San Diego and I went and
excited to start a tone in my pitch and
in the middle of it he stopped me he
said it doesn&#39;t work that&#39;s well how do
you know it doesn&#39;t work he said look I
don&#39;t know why it doesn&#39;t work I just
know that if it was this easy somebody
smarter than you would have already done
it yes I thought that was a nice way to
call me dumb and I went home thinking I
just can&#39;t believe it but I stuck with
it and I found a way to finance it and
we ended up signing that contract with
the school district and another one just
like it with the YMCA and we have now
deployed over 25 million dollars in
solar projects when a guy in the green
shirt with Solar City comes to your door
now it offers you solar with no money
down 20-year payments to save you money
that&#39;s the model I invented in 2008 when
people thought I was nuts it happened to
me the same thing happened to me about
two years ago in the biofuels industry I
was in a meeting and I met some very
clever engineers that designed a biomass
project that can burn coal cleanly and
create diesel for trucks not very sexy
but it worked it was really interesting
technology I just didn&#39;t want anything
to do with the coal industry
it&#39;s a dirty way that they minded its
environmental impacts are very bad and
the impacts on the miners is even worse
so I told him I might be interested if
they could find a way to burn something
else so they suggested burning recycled
tires that&#39;s not bad
or they say they could burn the solid
waste from a sewage treatment plant
that&#39;s not sexy definitely they want to
do that so I started newland on it like
I usually do and about a week later a
friend of mine unrelated to any of this
he&#39;s a strict vegan he sent me a report
about the environmental impacts of the
cattle industry on the environment and
the report concluded that about 20% of
the greenhouse gases in the environment
come from the manure from cattle
and he said give up meat I thought about
it for a second but those in and out
burgers are so good I put the report
aside and I didn&#39;t think much of it
about a week later I saw news reports
that Richard Branson from the virgin
companies was being criticized for not
doing enough for the environment while
he burns jet fuel in his airliners and
his trips to space and I&#39;m a big fan of
Branson I thought that&#39;s too bad for him
that night I had a dream and I woke up
in the morning with this crazy idea what
if we could tweak the technology and
burn cow manure and make jet fuel for
commercial airliners and then the
airlines would be fighting over who&#39;s
more green and it would create more
demand for my fuel I think it&#39;s a
transformative technology that can burn
gas emitting waste and turn it into fuel
so we don&#39;t have to drill for more
petroleum you can imagine my friends who
think they&#39;re funny came up with all
these jokes and puns about working with
manure right the business stinks you
really stepped in at this time or it&#39;s
all bull right just to get it back at
him I came up with my own pond that I
think is even better utterly clean the
bankers said I was nuts
they said biofuels don&#39;t pencil the
market isn&#39;t ready for something like
that and again I felt the same feeling
of rejection that I felt with solar well
today I&#39;m the chairman and CEO of an 88
year-old petroleum company that last
year purchased my company in order to go
green we have 13,000 shareholders and we
expect to open a plant by late next year
that can burn kal manure to make jet
fuel the last example of what happened
to me was in the turf business you seen
artificial turf in a lot of front yards
it&#39;s a great way to do it I have it at
my house but nobody has really deployed
it in large scale because it&#39;s very
expensive it has a big startup cost in
the break-even point like Solar is years
down the road so again I brought a
different mechanism to the table and I
said what if I could create a financing
mechanism
for homeowners associations they have a
lot of large common areas and remove
that grass install the turf give them
payments over time and when I had a cost
savings of water the electricity to
deliver that water which is about six
watts per gallon the environmental
impact of the lawn mowers and worst of
all the clippings of the grass that go
to the landfill to create methane it&#39;s a
crazy thing that we do we grow grass you
water it we grow it we mow it we throw
it away so we are now deploying hundreds
of thousand square feet at a time for
HOAs to save water to help the
environment we had to argue with the IRS
because we now are going to take
depreciation on the grass which nobody
has ever done before when we went to the
IRS they said nobody&#39;s ever done that
why do you want to do that I said
because it makes a lot of sense it now
makes sense so the most important thing
was my ignorance in the market is what
kept me from being trapped in the same
box that all these other people were
because I wasn&#39;t trained like them I
didn&#39;t think like them and I didn&#39;t have
the burden of their paradigm the reason
that solar prices were originally
connected to utility cost or because the
First Solar deals were done by utility
people that&#39;s their world the reason
that the bio fuels wasn&#39;t done is
because they&#39;re all looking at burning
corn and to make ethanol these other
things and nobody looked at the problem
right in front of them which is five
million tons a day of manure in the
United States so I just came at it from
outside the box which is what I really
do people say think outside the box I
live outside the box but the thing that
kept me from being trapped in the box
was that I wasn&#39;t afraid of my ignorance
I was able to go past the note because
had I not done that I&#39;d be here telling
you about a crazy idea for I had for
Stoller one time but I didn&#39;t pursue it
or a dream that I had about powering
jets with the manure from cows because I
didn&#39;t listen to the knows ignorance
isn&#39;t an insult it&#39;s actually a
compliment it&#39;s a compliment to the
strength that it takes to go past
the regular thinking to not stop when
people say it can&#39;t be done or
somebody&#39;s smarter than you would have
already done it so I leave you with this
I hope you do pursue those crazy ideas
that you have because I know just about
everybody has that crazy idea and
they&#39;re afraid to step out of the box
and feel humiliated and like I did and
my hope for you is that you&#39;re ignorant
enough to give it a real try thank you
for sharing your time with me
[Applause]
