so a couple of weeks ago I was giving
another speech go figure
- a group of Okinawan middle school
students where I was asked to describe
my work and I am a material scientist an
engineer by trade with a background in
nanotechnology and so the question arose
what is a nanometer the textbook
definition of a nanometer is a billionth
of a meter but then that got me to
thinking does anyone really know what a
billionth of a meter is and that kind of
took me down a line of thinking of just
how ill-equipped the human mind is at
comprehending quantities that are very
large and very small now comprehending
quantities that are very large and very
small are is very important to science
because in essence science is all about
the quantification and qualification of
things in the world around us right and
you watch these documentaries sometime
and in these documentaries they&#39;ll talk
about how the universe is 14 billion
years old or how the universe may be
comprised of strings that are 10 to the
minus thirty fifth of a meter but to be
honest I don&#39;t think anyone the narrator
myself or the Audion or the intended
audience can actually comprehend these
skills to actually Intuit what these
numbers mean in the words of Richard
Dawkins our brains have evolved to help
us survive within the orders of
magnitude of size and speed at which our
bodies operate at and this talk is an
attempt just an attempt to penetrate
these veils of vastness smallness and
innumerable &#39;ti of the world around us
so the first thing I came across in
preparing for this talk was that human
beings are terrible at counting all of
us and I do mean all of us can&#39;t really
count beyond 8 now before everybody gets
up in arms about their fancy college
education I
to clarify what I mean by counting
counting here I mean what I mean by
counting here is Sabbat is a ssin a term
coined in 1949 by an American
psychologist by the name of Al Kaufman
sabot ization is our gut feeling for
numbers our ability to look at a certain
amount of something of identical objects
and immediately say oh there&#39;s three or
four of this on the table and it turns
out that beyond a your mileage will
definitely vary but let&#39;s look at why
I&#39;d like to ask the audience to do a bit
of a thought experiment with me here so
I&#39;d like you all to imagine a single
elephant with majestic tusks and trunk
and all even if you haven&#39;t been to the
zoo you can probably imagine what an
elephant looks like next I&#39;d like to ask
the audience to find their elephant a
nice date so now you have two elephants
still within the realm of possibility
how about three elephants doable for
elephants yeah you could do that five
elephants uh so what&#39;s happening here
chances are you&#39;ve started putting your
elephants in recognizable shapes
triangles or rows or crosses or squares
or what have you
and this is a neat thing that the brain
does called visual grouping studied in
1930s and 1940s by group by a school of
psychology called Gestalt psychology in
Germany this school found that even
babies were capable of discerning and
identifying small abstract numbers they
were able to identify that three of
something was more than two of something
but in that same vein as the number
increases or as the or as the adage goes
as above so below if the fraction
decreases it becomes more difficult for
us to subah ties so a hundred elephants
a thousand elephants not as easy to
actually imagine as one cognitive
scientist called Douglas Hofstadter put
it we have a sense of number numbness
for very large and very small quantities
so that&#39;s one thing that&#39;s getting in
the way of our perception of very large
and very small quantities
another thing that&#39;s also getting in the
way is how we define numbers because how
we define numbers inadvertently ends up
affecting how we perceive them there are
two kinds of numbers
the first is cardinal numbers and that
is the numbers those are the numbers
that we use for counting on a day-to-day
basis the number of things so for
example the number of unnecessary
sequels or prequels or reboots or
spin-offs in your favorite movie
franchise
seriously Hollywood enough on the other
hand there are also ordinal numbers and
ordinal numbers are the numbers in a
sequence the first second third fourth
fifth and sixth item on a list now this
is very very important because
scientific notation which is by far the
most common means of representing human
numbers is involved with juggling
cardinal and ordinal quantities so for
example instead of saying 10,000 you can
say 10 to the fourth power right or
instead of saying 1,000 you can say 10
to the third power scientific notation
is a strong but double-edged weapon in
our representation of large quantities
it allows us to make immediate
assertions that 6 million of something
is less than 7 million of something but
on the other hand it does nothing for us
if you put six million grains of sand on
the ground right now
and I immediately ask you how many
grains of star there you can&#39;t do you
can&#39;t count that that you can&#39;t sabotage
that the notation is only good for
representing the numbers not for
intuiting them right and at the core of
this at the core of scientific notation
is this idea of exponentiation this idea
of multiplying or dividing a number by
itself a certain number of times right
and we deal with exponentiation all the
time with denominations of money when we
say the number of Dimes in a dollar or
the number of $10 bills in a hundred
right so manipulating numbers having to
go back and forth and basically compare
quantities is something that is
happening in different regions of the
brain when we try and when I ask you to
do a long division problem it turns out
that
functional MRI studies show us that it&#39;s
the left hemisphere portions of the left
hemisphere of your brain that are
lighting up like a Christmas tree doing
this operation on the other hand when I
hold up three fingers and I hold up four
fingers and I ask you which one of these
is bigger it&#39;s actually both hemispheres
of your brain that are involved in
comparing numbers
long story short as far as your brain is
concerned doing math and comparing
quantities are two completely different
things so that can get in the way of
your understanding of what large numbers
are or what small numbers are to put
this in perspective a million dollars
could fit in a suitcase a billion
dollars would require a large pickup
truck to transport whereas a trillion
dollars would be a football field as
high as the average adult male now
orders are magnitude are ordinal right
the orders of magnitude themselves for
example the third power the fourth power
the minus third power are ordinal but
they increase earth medically they are
linear so third fourth fifth and so on
however the quantities that they
represent the cardinal numbers that they
represent are increasing exponentially
we&#39;re multiplying again the number again
by itself so each number for example in
the thousandfold common usage of numbers
of millions billions and trillions is a
thousandfold of the preceding number so
numbers can quickly blow much larger
than we can understand them one last
thing to also consider as to why numbers
are so difficult to calm and small
numbers are so difficult to comprehend
is their novelty 1939 a mathematician by
the name of Edward Kasner challenged his
nine-year-old nephew to come up with an
inconceivably large number his nephew
Milton industrious fellow that he was
decided to take a piece of paper write
down one and follow it with a hundred
zeroes he called this number a Google
now a Google truly is large so large in
fact that it might be larger than the
total number of atoms in the
servable universe which scientists
guesstimate at 10 to the 81st power
simply speaking before very recent times
we simply did not have neither the
computational power nor the resolving
power to actually observe numbers that
were very large or very small of
anything of a God Rose number which you
may remember from your high school
chemistry class as the number of species
B they atoms ions or atoms in a grand
mole of substance is something that is
very recent it was only discovered in
1909 which is a blink of an eye
in the hill in the human in human
history right another thing to consider
is that for example looking very far
away with say the Hubble Space Telescope
the Hubble was launched in living memory
it was launched in 1990 and even just
last year in 2016 they discovered yet
another distant galaxy and broke the
cosmic distance record so seeing things
that are this far is still something
that is ongoing in closing there&#39;s an
ongoing debate in pedagogy developmental
psychology and cognitive neuroscience
about why it is so difficult for human
beings to comprehend very large and very
small quantities and to be frank I think
that nothing short of a sci-fi s
cybernetic upgrade would allow a person
to just look at a pile of sand and say
oh yeah of course there&#39;s 53 million 237
499 grains in this pile but the takeaway
here isn&#39;t how to perceive these large
quantities it&#39;s what&#39;s getting in the
way in the hope that this awareness will
help the pedagogy the pedagogical
community in conveying large and small
quantities so first of all just to
summarize cognition the sense of number
numbness that gets in the way and the
lateralization of rein function we&#39;re
doing operations and comparing
quantities occupies different regions of
the mind second convention and the
scientific notation and how it can be a
double-edged weapon and finally novelty
in perceiving and quantifying very large
and very small quantities thank you
you
