okay good afternoon everyone I am happy
to be here and to have a chance to speak
to you and my topic will be connected to
cams and learning English in a fun way
okay how many of you remember the first
time when you were motivated to learn
English when you were not afraid of
speaking it because I remember my first
time was at the summer camp and I
remember the day when I was told that
there was going to be a Drama Camp
conducted and I can say that I was very
eager to participate at first because it
was the middle of summer I had a lot of
friends at home and I didn&#39;t want to
leave my comfort zone I didn&#39;t want to
meet new people as well as to speak in
English and that week actually changed
me a lot
I became motivated to speak because I
met a few Americans who were just
awesome people I was able to speak
non-stop English and I tried a lot of
interesting activities for example I was
able to perform on stage for the first
time I was able to play different
exciting games and I loved it so much
that the next year I decided to
participate together and I encouraged a
lot of my friends to come too and year
after year I started visiting this
language summer camps and it was an
awesome experience
I might meet people i broadened my
knowledge about different topics and it
was just interesting to practice my
English and to try all that things and
you may wonder why I got involved into
organizing camps maybe because it was in
2013 when I was an exchange student in
States I took part in many different
extracurricular activities and I loved
them so much
then when I returned back I felt the
need that I want to do something in our
community and as the head of the NGO the
main aim of which is implementing
different projects we start working on
one and we conducted a summer camp for
kids and I&#39;m telling you this because I
want you to see that this was a huge
progress for me because starting from
the kid who was afraid to meet people
who was afraid to speak I became a
person who is standing here on this
stage and talking to you so thank you
organizing a camp is not easy it
requires a lot of work and a lot of
effort and you have to have everything
thoroughly planned but we were lucky we
had a great team of people and some of
them I see here in this big room and I&#39;m
thankful for them and we also had to
combine everything because we understood
that our camp should include many
activities and it should be in a new
format with non-traditional approach and
we decided to conduct it in a fun way a
lot of students were able to play games
they just loved Energizer&#39;s and many fun
things but our camp was not only about
fun activities it&#39;s also included
different topics which were interesting
to discuss for example we talked about
leadership we talked about Human Rights
gender issues multiculturalism and I
think that these topics were interesting
pockets and they were in Croson that&#39;s
why the students were motivated to speak
English and of course they were very shy
the first day they didn&#39;t want to speak
they were like laughing and just making
jokes but by the end of the week
everyone was willing to share to tell
their experience and they were
risk-taking with the language because
they knew that they could make a mistake
and we won&#39;t judge them or put a bad
mark for their English and they love
that experience and actually I&#39;m
passionate about English and I&#39;m
passionate about meeting new people and
to do interesting things and I just love
summer camps and I love youth camps and
I think it&#39;s a great opportunity to
reveal your talents to reveal your
personality to develop your
communication skills and leadership
skills because you are actively involved
in different activities there you have
to improvise you have to make
presentations you have to perform
it gives you it gives you a motivation
to improve yourself it helps to boost
your confidence and talking about
education in the 21st century I want to
say that summer camps and different
camps are extremely important because
they focus on collaboration they focus
on communication they help to improve
your leadership skills and improve your
personality and proddin your worldview
and I think that we should motivate
students as a teachers and as young
people just team leaders because it&#39;s a
great experience for them and they will
remember it for all their entire lives
and I think that such camps is a huge
progress because they help to give they
give students an opportunity to speak
outside the classroom and it gives a
very positive result thank you
[Applause]
