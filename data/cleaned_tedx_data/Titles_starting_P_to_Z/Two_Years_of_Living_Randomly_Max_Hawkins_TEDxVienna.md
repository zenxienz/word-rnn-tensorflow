I used to love waking up at exactly 7
a.m. when I lived in San Francisco I
would wake up right at 7 a.m. and
immediately go to my favorite coffee
shop it was my favorite coffee shop
because it was the best coffee shop I I
done the research it was 5 stars it was
great and I would drink my coffee and
get onto my bicycle and ride into work
and I had I&#39;d optimized my schedule to
be perfect I was constantly like shaving
off 1 or 2 seconds making it slightly
faster so I could get into work faster I
was working as a software engineer at
Google and in a lot of ways this was my
dream job it felt like this was the
thing that the rest of my life was
leading up towards I&#39;d always wanted to
work in software and I was finally doing
it and I was living in San Francisco
just a city that I love surrounded by
people who were like me and every part
of my life was perfectly tailored to my
interests the things that I wanted to do
I loved it so one day I was at work and
I started to read this paper a computer
science research paper about predictive
analytics and the gist of the paper was
that if you take someone&#39;s GPS trace
like the the listing of all the places
that they&#39;ve been in the past month or
so and you feed it into a machine
learning algorithm you can predict with
fairly high accuracy where they&#39;re going
to be on the following day and I thought
this was kind of cool and I was thinking
like what would happen if you put my GPS
trace into the algorithm what would come
out the other end so it&#39;s taking with my
friend Kelly and we were planning
something to do after work that day and
I got onto the O and found this really
great bar that had just opened up and I
was about to suggest that we go to this
bar when I stopped I started thinking
about that algorithm again and I started
thinking wait a second isn&#39;t this bar
exactly where that algorithm would guess
that I was going to go this evening
and I was kind of weird because I
thought that I where was I in that I
know that I was the one making the
choice right but how did the computer
know about that
so that was little disturbing and since
I&#39;m an engineer I whenever I have a
problem like this my instinct is to fix
it to make something that solves the
problem and so I decided to make an app
that would help me choose where to go on
this evening and so the way that it
works is that the app looks at all of
the places that are on Google Maps in
the city of San Francisco and then
chooses one at random and then it calls
an uber and that car shows up at your
location and takes you to that random
place it tells the uber driver where
where the random places but tells you
nothing and so it&#39;s a big surprise when
you arrive and so I texted Kellie and I
said we should do this
we met up and press the button and
suddenly miraculously
there was an uber driver at my apartment
door so we got in and very quickly
started heading to a part of San
Francisco that neither of us really knew
it was a part of town that we just had
never been in before and when the driver
told us we&#39;d reached our destination we
thought it must have been a joke we
showed up in front of this austere brick
building with a wrought iron fence in
front of it and a sign that said the
words San Francisco General Hospital
psychiatric emergency center
which maybe maybe that&#39;s pretty
appropriate I don&#39;t know but we thought
it was funny but but it was also
exhilarating because here we were in
this place that we never would have gone
to otherwise doing something really
different on a Friday night yeah and I
was hooked like I this I started using
this app to do go to all different
places in San Francisco I went to
museums randomly random grocery stores
random bars random bowling alleys random
florists and I started discovering that
there was an entire side to San
Francisco that I had been ignoring
because of my preference and then I
started thinking how else can I apply
this concept to my life and so I started
building other experiments that involve
randomness I made a random youtube video
generator a random schedule generator a
random diet club that would randomly
eliminate a food from my my diet each
week until its cumulative so it like
eventually just can&#39;t eat
random tattoo generator a random spotify
playlist random podcast a printer that
prints out random suggestions of things
to do a random Facebook event generator
in the way that this one works is that
in a city like Vienna on a given day
there are hundreds of Facebook events
public Facebook events that are going on
so you would choose one at random and
say this is your plan for tonight so I
ended up showing
and so I&#39;d show up at events like Joe&#39;s
birthday the 8th grade band recital
chess club truck driver school and it
was really interesting because these
were communities that I knew nothing
about that we&#39;re having amazing events
to talk about things that they cared
about and and there I was after a while
I had the opportunity to transition my
work into freelance which gave me a lot
more flexibility about where I lived and
so I decided what if I could let the
computer decide what part of the world I
lived in and so I wrote a program that
figured out every city that was possible
for me to live in give him my budget and
then chose one at random and I started
living this way and it sent me all over
the world Taipei Taiwan Mumbai India
Dubai even places that for an American
are really off the beaten path like
Essen Germany and gorg-gina Slovenia and
every time I would go to a new city I
would do the same sort of stuff I was
doing in San Francisco go to random
events meet random people and I&#39;d lived
there for two to three months and then
asked a computer again for the next
location I did this for two years
paradoxically giving up control to this
this machine actually made me feel more
free than when I was making choices
because I discovered that my preference
had blinded me from the complexity and
the richness of the world and following
the computer gave me the courage to live
outside of my comfort zone to discover
parts of the human experience but I
ignored because they were too different
or not for me I ended up in in Mumbai
India for a while and I was going to a
lot of Facebook events when I was there
and one day the computer sent me to this
yoga class and I&#39;m really bad at yoga
but I went anyway and I found myself
descending into a downward
dog when I when I had a revelation
because I was thinking about you know
this random stuff is really it&#39;s really
freeing it&#39;s sort of putting me outside
of my bubble my comfort zone but really
how random is it because this was not my
first yoga then in Mumbai in fact it was
my third that week and if you think
about it
it&#39;s not surprising that you see
patterns like this because I was
choosing randomly from a list of things
that was decidedly not random the list
of Facebook events that are happening in
a city is very influenced by the things
that are going on in the city like that
if you think about it every time you
make a choice you&#39;re not just making it
on your own you&#39;re selecting from a list
a menu of choices that was designed by
someone or something else and whatever
freedom that you have in that choice is
necessarily constrained by social
structures customs and history that
provide the context for that selection
so initially I thought of this as a way
of getting outside of my bubble as you
know transcending my my self my
preference but eventually I started to
think about it differently I started to
think about it as a way of taking a
photograph when I was in a place like
Mumbai it was more likely that I would
show up at a yoga event but if I was in
Vienna maybe a music event would be more
likely every time that I was choosing
randomly in a city what I was doing was
making an inquiry asking Mumbai tell me
what you&#39;re about and then the answer
would tell me something about the
structure of that city and my
relationship to it and its relationship
with the rest of the world and so I I
had like a really tidy ending for this
previously and as I was coming up here I
decided to scrap it because
you know I think that like a problem
with with TED talks often is that they
they wrap up in a in a tidy bow and then
you can go away without really thinking
about it you can sort of just it feels
like everything is okay at the end and I
think in in today&#39;s like in in the world
that we&#39;re living in there there are a
lot of real problems and I think that
these questions of algorithmic control
play a lot into them we&#39;re talking right
now about the role that that Facebook
had in the American election there are a
lot of questions about the ways that
these algorithms are controlling their
lives and so I don&#39;t know I I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying and I don&#39;t
have like a very clear conclusion but I
would just encourage you to try to be
experimental when it comes to
interacting with these algorithms
because if you just do the defaults
follow your preference go in the
direction that everything else is going
it&#39;s really easy to get caught in a
place where you can be controlled and
yeah I think I think that&#39;s it thank you
[Applause]
