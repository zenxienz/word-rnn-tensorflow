you and I have an incredibly
hard-working friend who is completely
underappreciated
and is in serious trouble and there&#39;s
something out in space that can
significantly help our friend you&#39;re
gonna love it you&#39;re gonna love it but
first let&#39;s take a moment to appreciate
the hard work that our friend does for
us I&#39;d like to I&#39;d like to tell the
story of our friends hard work through
of all things a fruit salad some
strawberries blueberries well throw in
some sliced apple it&#39;s easy to taste
each delicious bite you see our friend
is the relentless worker that visited
each plant for this fruit salad moving
pollen between flowers to produce these
specific fruits pollinators honey bees
bumble bees monarchs birds hover flies
and other beneficial insects provide an
incredible service moving a sufficient
amount of pollen between flowers to
produce the beautiful fruits and
vegetables for our markets because
without their hard work fruit doesn&#39;t
grow or or it ends up smaller and
misshapen evidence a poor pollination is
easy to find in the United States each
year bees provide more than 15 billion
dollars of pollination services to our
agricultural sector and globally their
contribution is more than 200 billion
now for this one common fruit salad made
with these ingredients bees had to make
more than 1,000 individual visits to
flowers that&#39;s two to three visits per
blueberry two to four visits per Apple
five to six visits per raspberry and
incredibly twenty or more visits for
each and every market-ready
strawberry now there&#39;s around
200 or so blueberries in a given pint so
when you just eat the whole thing the
way my five-year-old did after rating
the grocery bag that&#39;s 400 to 600
pollinator visits right there and it&#39;s
and it&#39;s not just our fruit salad one
third of every bite of our diets 75% of
crops globally rely on bees and wildlife
to move pollen between flowers even milk
you see alfalfa and clover require
pollination and they&#39;re the primary food
stock for dairy cattle we and the
livestock we raise I&#39;m talking to you
carnivores rely on pollinators for our
food ok it&#39;s about to get real - to
maximize the yield of coffee you need
pollinators 20 to 40 visits for each and
every coffee flower which gives you one
of these coffee cherries which gives you
two coffee beans
the simple morning ritual of a single
cup of coffee is a harvest representing
between more than between excuse me
representing between one and two
thousand individual visits from bees to
flowers billions of fruits trillions and
trillions of visits to flowers now this
topic is timely because unfortunately
populations of pollinators are in crisis
the story&#39;s not new it&#39;s just new to us
you see in southwest China farmers lash
chicken feathers to bamboo rods and then
use those tools to pollinate crops by
hand the bees there have been wiped out
by insecticides they visit each flower
of these pear trees back in the United
States a single acre of blueberries has
around 10 million little blueberry
flowers all blooming about the same time
and if you don&#39;t get them pollinated
within a few days no fruit nationally we
cultivate 82,000 acres of blueberries so
that&#39;s
eight hundred and twenty billion
blueberry flowers yeah it sounds like an
extraordinary amount of work but only
until you compare it to the annual
almond harvest an almond bloom which has
three times as many flowers
we&#39;re not pollinating our crops by hand
we&#39;re not there yet but our fields are
becoming quieter our gardens are
becoming more still evidence of the
eerie absence of natural wildlife is
coming with greater and greater
regularity for example the honeybee
since the 1950s we&#39;ve lost nearly 50% of
our honeybee population the federal
pollinator protection plan established a
goal of to maintain that annual loss at
fifteen percent
unfortunately last year&#39;s annual loss
was 33 percent representing nearly
900,000 dead bee hives and then the
rusty patch bumble bee once common in 28
states from the Dakotas to Maine to
Virginia is now 90% population depleted
and according to the xerxes society an
organization exclusively committed to
the conservation of insects and other
invertebrates the rusty patch is one of
a dozen species of native u.s. and
canadian bumblebees at risk of
extinction and while they&#39;re not doing
much pollinating we see similar trends
in other important and beloved species
like birds peer-reviewed science from
Audubon shows that half of the bird
species on the continent are at risk you
see in order to manage the worst effects
of a change in climate
native birds need native plants and the
insects that have co-evolved with them
no insects no Birds and finally the
monarch since 1990 we&#39;ve lost nearly 1
billion monarchs and if the current
trends continue a viable population the
eastern monarch could be wiped out by a
single storm within our lifetime
taken as a whole this is what one
leading scientist refers to as an
all-hands-on-deck moment now pollinator
protection is featured for the first
time this year on a US postage stamp and
nationally this issue is getting a lot
of attention and it&#39;s easy to understand
why pollinators are important to us and
other wildlife pollinators are in
decline and compared with some of the
wicked problems we face as a society we
can do something about it
you see habitat loss is a leading cause
in the decline of these species but
providing healthy sources of pollen and
nectar free of insecticides has not been
simple turf grass lawns now cover an
area four times larger than the state of
New Jersey 40 million acres suburbs are
expanding corporate campuses mini-marts
urban and suburban homeowners mostly
aren&#39;t giving up their lawns and farmers
face pressure to increase crop yields
new practices have largely eliminated
the pollinator friendly plants from the
row crop fields that dominate production
acreage so what can we do about it
that&#39;s kind of the way things are but
you know we can plant backyard gardens
in fact the National 2015 pollinator
protection plan encouraged each of us to
plant a backyard garden of any size and
that&#39;s important yes we should do this
and also we need to think creatively to
bring in new capital new partners to
push ourselves and see new opportunities
and you know in that mindset I want to
tell you a story about back in 1993
entrepreneur Paul Hawken he challenged
each of us engineers designers everyone
to come up with a system to create a
system that profitably nourishes and
enriches life on Earth and so I want to
share an unusual and unexpected way that
we can significantly help our pollinator
friends and like I said
it starts way off in space but then it
comes right back down to farmland and
what these species need to survive in
the earliest days of the space race
batteries were incredibly heavy and also
only ran for a few days and the US was
looking for a ways to power satellites
for years at a time so sure enough by
the 1960s all satellites were equipped
with solar panels now since then a
combination of public and private
investments in research and development
paired with state level policies have
driven the cost of solar down by more
than 99% Solar is so cheap now in many
areas it&#39;s cheaper to build a new giant
scale solar array than to continue to
pay the millions of dollars for coal and
maintenance costs on those old
smokestack power plants and just like
the ones in space these are photovoltaic
or PV solar panels they don&#39;t get hot
because they&#39;re just converting sunlight
directly into electricity and the common
kind you see on rooftops and built into
some camping equipment an interest in
solar is growing incredibly fast here&#39;s
the rate of growth for solar from 1992
to 2012 and for comparison
that&#39;s roughly 8 times faster than the
rate of growth for mobile phones and the
Internet during the same period now
working in the public interest
economically and environmentally minded
nonprofit groups like the one I work for
have been encouraging this energy
transition clean air clean water
economic development more and more
businesses and municipalities homeowners
and churches data centers and school
districts have been saving hundreds to
thousands to millions of dollars by
getting more of their electricity from
the Sun so Solar is safe and it helps
people save a lot of money but some
communities have expressed real concern
about how much land is used for some of
these solar sites and I too am concerned
about the productive use of agricultural
land
farmland isn&#39;t that where our food comes
from and so that&#39;s why in 2016 a
coalition of agricultural conservation
and energy groups came together leaders
here in Minnesota to propose a new
vision for solar development in the
north it looks like this no it looks
like no okay seriously it looks it looks
like this we call it pollinator friendly
solar and I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not new and
it&#39;s not radical we imported it from
Europe where it&#39;s been common for years
and years
the key questions remain known well it
costs too much to do this in most places
and then if we do well it make any
difference now this could be a little
bit of a complicated calculation so
let&#39;s see if I can get some help there I
have a supercomputer in my pocket a
supercomputer could you calculate the
cost difference for using a
pollinator-friendly seed mix on most
solar arrays versus the current industry
practice of using turf grass or gravel
great thanks supercomputer I appreciate
your help on that supercomputer I had no
idea you were so passionate about this
issue family thing
got it
okay practically this is actually really
straightforward every solar array is
gonna have a vegetation management plan
the engineers simply work with an
ecologist to design a pollinator
friendly seed mix of low growing flowers
and native vegetation around and under
the panels and then in the perimeter
taller species like milkweed and
flowering shrubs and it&#39;s not just good
for pollinators compared to turf grass
or gravel those deep-rooted native
plants capture the storm water coming
off the panels channeling it right down
into the aquifer breaking up compacted
soils adding organic matter and
improving the quality of agricultural
soils over the life of the project once
a low growing meadow is established
usually a period of one to three years
there&#39;s less mowing and significantly
less incidents of mowers kicking up
rocks or colliding directly with solar
panels and standards encouraging
colonnades a friendly Solar practices
have been supported by overwhelming and
bipartisan majorities in Minnesota and
Maryland and are being developed in a
growing number of states ok but will it
will make any difference
you know beekeepers that manage honey
producing hives on pollinator friendly a
solar arrays describe them as a perfect
environment abundant and diverse nectar
and pollen sources throughout the
growing season free of direct
application of insecticides in several
of the world&#39;s foremost entomologist and
their PhD students PhD students are
enthusiastic about this approach but now
compared to that backyard garden which
we should still plant solar sites can
provide habitat at scale in fact in 2016
alone solar developers and utilities and
Rural Electric Cooperative&#39;s in
Minnesota and Wisconsin developed around
2,500 acres of pollinator friendly solar
sites now this is a ridiculously tiny
fraction of the more than 40 million
acres of farmland in these states but
for pollinators its habitat equivalent
to 1.5 million homes having a 6 foot by
12 foot pollinate
garden and the land lease contracts that
ensure maintenance of the vegetation are
for 25 years so for the more than 900
million acres of farmland that America
has and the tiny percentage of that
which farmers will choose to use for
solar let&#39;s maximize that productivity
we need to create spaces for bees and
pollinators to thrive and solar sites
can provide tens of thousands of new
acres of habitat each year so make a
plan for your own pollinator garden
Audubon has an online tool that makes it
as easy as entering your zip code and
also importantly make a plan to support
and share and advance this idea of
pollinator friendly solar with your help
this can maximize the productivity of
farm land and create habitat to benefit
pollinators another wildlife for a
generation now I happen to be a father
and we all have young people in our
lives that we care about and when their
children are the right age we&#39;ll be able
to share a story about a moment when we
decided to support clean air and clean
water and clean energy we&#39;ll be able to
share a story about a moment when we all
decided to help these important and
beloved species we&#39;ll be able to make
that fruit salad and appreciate each
bite with a new perspective and give
thanks that we still have all of our
hard-working pollinator friends thank
you
