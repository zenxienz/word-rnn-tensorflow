I&#39;m gonna start with a question I&#39;m a
wildlife biologist I&#39;m gonna start by
well I think it&#39;s not breaking news to
most of us that lots of wild animal
populations around the world are in big
trouble and we probably have some
preconceived notions about what human
impacts are the worst for a wildlife
high on the list would be chemical
pollution including carbon pollution
climate change has caused big impacts on
all sorts of wild animals and obviously
on people habitat loss is another big
one human activities have have caused
devastating impacts on all sorts of
habitats of wildlife from forests to
grasslands to coral reefs but one that
me might not think about and which my
students and I are especially interested
in are the human impacts on infectious
diseases of wildlife lots of animals all
animals have lots of pathogens and
parasites that can impact them but
humans in lots of ways can make those
pathogens worse and we&#39;re seeing an
increasing impact on all sorts of wild
animal species from pathogens a few
examples I could name many one really
recent one that&#39;s come that we&#39;ve become
aware of really in the last year or so
is called sea star wasting disease we
think it&#39;s caused by a virus that&#39;s been
exacerbated by climate change it
effectively causes starfish to
disintegrate they fall apart their limbs
fall off and crawl away on the ocean
floor and eventually they die this is a
worry because sea stars are really
important predators in intertidal
ecosystems we need them probably the
most famous wildlife disease and the the
sort of most major impact from wildlife
disease has been on frogs amphibian cat
radio mycosis has led to extinctions of
dozens of species the fastest decline of
vertebrate biodiversity that we&#39;ve ever
observed in the last 30 years so cause
massive declines we&#39;ve spread it all
over the place in the pet trade
and by other means by spreading water
around the one I&#39;m gonna talk most about
the one we&#39;ve been working on most
recently is a disease of hibernating
bats called white-nose syndrome this
little guy in the bottom right is is
heavily infected with a nasty fungus and
he won&#39;t survive but who cares why
should we care first about infectious
diseases of wildlife and second a
question near and dear to my heart why
should we care about bats which are kind
of unusual animals some of you may
remember this mediocre - maybe okay film
called contagion starring Gwyneth
Paltrow as patient zero she dies at a
horrible hemorrhagic death and Matt
Damon saves the world not because of his
super spy skills but because he just by
dumb luck happens to be resistant to the
pathogen to the contagion in the story
but it&#39;s actually based on it&#39;s a highly
far-fetched sort of dramatization of
what might happen in a global pandemic
but it&#39;s based on a real disease that
jumped from wild animals to livestock
and then to people humans went in cut
down some pristine rainforest and a bat
flew into a hog barn gave Nipah virus to
the Hogs the Hogs then transmitted it to
people and a whole bunch of people died
it didn&#39;t spread nearly as easily as the
disease in this movie as the pathogen in
this movie so it sort of flashed out but
many many other viral pathogens of
wildlife are a concern and most emerging
infectious diseases of people come from
wild animals so wildlife disease can
become human disease I think we should
care about bats for a range of reasons
but one reason I think is they&#39;re just
cool there are the only mammals that can
fly under their own power we worked with
a documentary crew this summer to get
these slow-motion videos of little brown
bats currently a common species but
critically endangered because of the
disease I&#39;m talking about tonight to
show their incredible maneuverability to
show this
this incredible flight performance that
ability to fly under their own power has
allowed them to spread everywhere on
earth where there are trees for them to
roost in and it&#39;s allowed them to
diversify into a vast array of handsome
beautiful really charismatic looking
species there are bats with suction cups
on their feet to let them hang on to the
insides of leaves there are bats where
the males have resonating chambers on
their faces so they can sound sexy to
females a vast array of of different
species most species also depend on an
incredibly cool way of perceiving the
world called echolocation they scream
out high-pitched sounds that are too
high for us to hear but incredibly loud
and then listening to listen for echoes
bouncing back
Vesna talked about some really cool
detectors that astrophysics nerds have
to perceive the universe bat nerds have
some cool detectors as well we have bat
detectors and those bad detectors
allowed us to convert that high-pitched
sound into something we can hear and
when we do that this is the call of a
Manitoba silver-haired app now that&#39;s a
that&#39;s a commuting call if the bat we&#39;re
honing in on a particular target the
calls get shorter and closer together
and that sounds like this oops
can I do it I could have just imitated
that that that sound we call a feeding
buzz and that&#39;s a great sign that we&#39;re
in good foraging habitat feeding habitat
if we hear lots of those calls
we know bats are eating and that&#39;s a
good place for about to be bats are cool
but they&#39;re also ecologically and
economically important and there are a
growing number of studies that show that
importance some of the best recent
experimental work comes from exclosure
studies in southern Illinois where the
researchers put up big nets at night to
prevent bats from foraging over the corn
they took them down during the day so
birds could still eat insects in the
fields but if you exclude bats you
dramatically increase damage to the corn
and we now know that bats in the u.s.
are worth billions of dollars for
agriculture so they&#39;re also important
animals and so those are some of the
reasons that biologists in New York
State were so alarmed in 2007 when they
went into caves to do their annual
surveys to count their bats and instead
of seeing scenes like this with
thousands of bats snuggling and cuddling
on the ceilings of caves they found this
in four of their caves carpets of dead
bats carpets of skeletons and a few
survivors hanging on the ceiling and the
walls with this white stuff growing all
over their skin folks pretty quickly
worked out that this was a newly
discovered fungus it hadn&#39;t been
described before it&#39;s a cold loving
fungus it only grows in the cold
we mercifully abbreviate the name of it
to PD and it invades the skin of the
wings and faces so this wing on over
here is badly damaged from this fungus
growing into the tissue
it only invades the skin so it doesn&#39;t
invade other organs but somehow it was
causing bats to die and that&#39;s one of
the things we wanted to figure out early
on it also spread incredibly quickly
this is a map showing the spread
throughout East
North America in less than ten years it
was only discovered in four caves in
2007 since then it spread halfway across
the continent it&#39;s moved incredibly
quickly and it just jumped last year to
across the Rockies so it&#39;s really bad
news for bats all across North America
so a couple of questions we wanted to
work out early on where did this thing
suddenly come from and what&#39;s it
actually doing to bats if we figure that
out maybe we can figure out how to help
them well before this disease came along
I studied hibernation and one of the
reasons I studied bats to understand
hibernation is that they&#39;re superstars
of hibernating our little brown bats in
Manitoba have to survive eight months on
only two grams of stored fat they don&#39;t
eat anything in the winter and so to do
that they really drop their body
temperature this is a plot of the skin
temperature of a hibernating bat that
we&#39;ve measured with this little backpack
data logger a healthy bat during
hibernation it spends most of its time
at a really cold body temperature about
seven degrees but every few weeks and
all hibernators have to do this it
rewarmed to a normal body temperature
for about two hours we&#39;re not totally
sure why hibernators do this ground
squirrels do it
skunks do it Chipmunks do it they all do
it they have to do it at some interval
there&#39;s something about being a mammal
and being cold for really long periods
that&#39;s incompatible they spend most of
their winter fat reserves on those
really shorter Razzles they have to
shiver and spend a ton of energy to get
back to a normal body temperature
usually what they do is have a pee maybe
they fly around a little bit and then
they have a nap they&#39;re cold brains
can&#39;t sleep properly and then they go
back into these long energy-saving boats
of what we call torpor down here well
when we looked at the body temperatures
of bats that were infected in their skin
with this fungus what we found is that
by the end of the winter as the fungus
grows into their wings their rewarming
about three times too often and as a
result each of these arouses cost about
three weeks of cold time three weeks of
fat
they run out of fat too quickly and
starve and around the time we were doing
those experiments folks in Europe were
also frantically looking for this fungus
on their bats to see if they should be
worried about a nasty infectious die-off
as well and what you see in these red
circles on this map are sites throughout
Europe where they found PD growing on
European bats and in fact it&#39;s now been
found as far east as China it&#39;s probably
everywhere in the old world growing
happily on bats which don&#39;t die in
massive numbers throughout Eurasia so it
occurs all over the place a bunch of
lines of evidence support the hypothesis
that it was accidentally introduced to
North America there are a number of
studies but some of the most compelling
sort of circumstantial evidence is that
one of those first four sites where it
was found in New York State is a huge
tourist attraction called Howe Caverns
gets tens of thousands of visitors per
year you can do walking tours and boat
tours if that floats your boat you can
also get married in the cave if you want
to have a wedding in a cold damp place
so it&#39;s very busy the leading hypothesis
to explain how it got here is that
someone who visited a cave in Europe or
Asia tracked it over here on their boots
didn&#39;t wash their boots after they
visited Howe Caverns so an example of
how humans can make infectious diseases
worse what can we do about it there have
been a number of ideas about what we
might do the first thing we started to
do was to make sure we weren&#39;t spreading
it from place to place and so biologists
are now very careful to wear really
fashionable clothing when we go caving
that we can dispose of and clean we&#39;re
careful about cleaning our boots and we
try and do as much outreach as we can
with people who explore caves there are
thousands and thousands of them in the
US fewer in Canada to make sure that
those folks are cleaning their climbing
gear their caving boots they&#39;re closed
so we don&#39;t spread it from place to
place that&#39;s only going to go so far
though because we know the bats are
spreading it as well and so there&#39;s been
a real push to try and cure this
life disease we know there are lots of
things that beat it up really nicely in
a petri dish
so over here we&#39;ve got white nose
syndrome fungus happily growing on a
petri dish here we&#39;ve introduced a
bacterium that was actually isolated
from the wings of a resistant bat
species that prevents it from growing
you can see what&#39;s called a zone of
inhibition here we&#39;ve put this on live
bats infected with the fungus here in
our lab at UW and found that we can make
things a little bit better in a really
controlled lab setting the trick is
translating this to something we might
do in caves in the wild and there are a
bunch of logistic challenges associated
with that that probably make it
impossible one of the most important
ones is that we don&#39;t know where most of
the bats are to treat especially in
Western North America we have no idea
where our bats are hibernating in some
parts of the eastern US we had a pretty
good handle on where the bats were
before this thing started but many of
them are hiding in places that are
really tough to reach one of the things
that we did in Canada and started to do
in the US is the thing we always do when
species are in trouble or we should
always do when they&#39;re in trouble is
list them as endangered or threatened
and the reason we do that is that it
comes with some automatic habitat
protection when we list the species as
endangered there are certain activities
that are now prohibited in habitats
critical habitats of those species and
we&#39;ve been looking at this approach as a
way to help bats potentially recover we
know that some individuals are surviving
and we also know that European bats
appear to have evolved resistance to the
disease but if those survivors don&#39;t
have really great habitats in the
summertime when they come out of
hibernation and have to reproduce they
can&#39;t help populations recover if they
can reproduce presumably they can pass
on heritable traits to their offspring
that help them survive the winter with
the fungus we call that evolutionary
rescue in conservation biology if we can
help survivors reproduce we may increase
the proliferation of resist
traits in the population so we&#39;ve known
for decades what mother bats love in the
summertime to help their pups grow
quickly they like warm roosts they like
intact forests they like a mix of old
forests and lots of water so there are
lots of bugs around and lots of places
to hang out during the day and for some
species we also know that they love
artificial structures many of you have
probably interacted with bats and
cottages or cabins maybe some of you
have a bat house that has bats in it
little brown bats especially love to use
bat houses and so we&#39;ve wondered if we
could make those habitats even better
for reproduction by bats in the
summertime
can we actually hotbox bats can we
create an artificial habitat a heated
bat box that they like even better than
their natural roost and so here Quinn
and Kaley are showing our prototype we
have worked with the Quebec government
on a citizen science website that lets
people register existing bat colonies on
their properties and count their bats
for us you can check it out at bat watch
CA this has allowed us to identify a lot
of keen citizen scientists who are
willing to let us put one of our
experimental heated bat boxes on their
properties so we&#39;ve now put out 30 of
our experimental boxes we&#39;re checking on
them we&#39;ll be checking on them over the
next few years so I started with a
question what what human impacts are the
worst for wildlife I think we probably
don&#39;t need to do a ranking here and I
think one of the points I want to sort
of highlight is that many wildlife
conservation issues boil down to death
by a thousand cuts we&#39;ve got bats that
maybe don&#39;t have the best habitats to
live in and we&#39;ve now combined that with
a pathogen that we&#39;ve spread around the
world
so we&#39;ve got a combination of issues
going on and that&#39;s often a real problem
for a wildlife conservation in general
what can we do about wildlife disease
well a sort of inside baseball kind of
take-home message for people interested
in wildlife policy at the moment
surveillance and response and research
for wildlife disease
is really a kind of piecemeal sort of
process there are many organizations in
many different countries that have
different responsibilities there&#39;s not
good coordination like for example in a
body like the World Health Organization
for wildlife so that would be a step in
the right direction policy wise for
ourselves and I show this picture of the
little customs card you have to fill out
when you cross the border a little bit
tongue-in-cheek we&#39;re not going to solve
the problem by not lying on our customs
card if we visited a farm in the last
few weeks but being aware of biosecurity
and understanding why these questions
are on your customs card is is useful if
as tourists as visitors to other
countries if we&#39;re out in nature we
should be aware of what we&#39;re tracking
around on our boots and we can put up
bat houses and encourage some cuddly fur
net new friends thanks very much
