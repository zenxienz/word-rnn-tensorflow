you know this is something that&#39;s real
passionate to me I am the executive
director of crisis pregnancy center and
they&#39;re not calling you know I see young
ladies and young men coming through our
doors with a lack of fathering and when
we see that lack of fathering when they
witness a strong male figure something
in them two takes place something
positive takes place within them and
what&#39;s interesting about that is that
they begin to see themselves in a
positive light please understand this
that every single social ill that we&#39;re
dealing with is directly or indirectly
related to fatherlessness do you realize
that close to 81 percent of teen
pregnancies come from fatherless homes
I&#39;m talking 80 percent of all of our
kids that are on the street right now
homeless fatherless homes we&#39;re talking
seventy-one percent of the male
population in the penal system right now
fatherless homes now these are just a
few of the documented stats I mean the
economic impact cannot even be
calculated because it&#39;s estimated that&#39;s
forty one percent of the kids that are
in fatherless homes will be poorer than
their biological dad it is just
absolutely astonishing
now again I&#39;m the executive director of
crisis pregnancy center here in Reno and
I&#39;ve developed a program called Daddy
Academy now the probability of these
young men coming through our doors
understanding what it is to be a father
it&#39;s pretty dim pretty pretty dim
especially in light of the facts that I
just mentioned and so we what we&#39;ve done
is we we develop programs and we don&#39;t
develop workshops that&#39;s specifically
designated to help them see the
importance of fathers fathering and
we&#39;ve expanded this not only to our
community outreach and not only in our
areas of our of our teens but we also
spread it out in the community we&#39;ve got
local local judges that have
grabbed ahold of our programs we have
local people that are seriously involved
in what we&#39;re trying to do now the
interesting thing about this we&#39;ve seen
a dramatic change as a direct result of
this program you know I was talking to
some of our young ladies and it was for
things that they said that they wish
they had those four things when they
grew up without a dad was this they said
they wish they had protection they said
they wish they had provision they said
they wish they had presence and they
wish they had praise now I want you to
hear what&#39;s happening because I&#39;ve
talked also to some of the guys out
there some of the pimps out there they
said not every young lady is pimple but
when she lacks those very things when
she lacks those things that would cause
her to feel better about herself she&#39;s
more willing to do things that goes
against her morals it&#39;s unbelievably
uncaring their father riff and the
father wound that is so prevalent we&#39;re
talking 24 million children right now
globally and fatherless homes so I&#39;m
asking this this afternoon free to
listen to what I have to say because
this wound is deep it&#39;s extremely deep
and it affects our whole culture now
hear my heart when I say this mothers
I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re not doing a
great job because you are but there&#39;s
certain things that only a father can
feel there&#39;s only certain things that a
dad can bring to bear now I&#39;ll be I&#39;ll
be perfectly frank with you I didn&#39;t
have didn&#39;t have a father growing up my
dad died when I was in middle school and
when he died when I was in middle school
it it caused me to grope for a father
figure and because I groped for a father
figure I looked for it everywhere so
there&#39;s a deep desire in all of us for
to have significance there&#39;s a deep
desire for all of us to have a
confirmation now see I I would be remiss
not to say this being a pastor but Jesus
needed affirmation but when he came up
out of the water
after being baptized it said that he
heard three things
from heaven here does father say this
you&#39;re my son
I love you and I&#39;m pleased with you
now if the Son of God needed affirmation
from a father figure you and I need
that&#39;s very same thing my heart this
afternoon is to talk to you and to
convey to you the importance of father
me again
growing up without a father there was
things that I groped for but I learned
something I learned that me fathering
others I can vicariously father myself I
can heal the father wound in me by
fathering others
now fathering I have I have I guess you
call them children or kids men that are
old enough to be my dad that I fathered
daughters that are old enough to be my
mother so aids of no significance it&#39;s
something that is deeply rooted within
us that affirmation that we must have
you know I will share something
extremely personal earlier this year my
sister died and this is the a long line
of unfortunate siblings that have died
in the last 10 years and this was really
personal this one really hurt because my
sister was more or less a she was like a
twin a year older than me but she was a
twin and I was broken really broken and
I was just hurting and of course my
family my other family members called
and said we need you here and so my wife
and I we made arrangements to make that
six seven hour drive from Reno to
Henderson my son comes to me and he says
dad I&#39;m gonna go with you I mean I want
to pay respects to my aunt but I&#39;m
really I want to be there for you I said
okay so I know that I needed and so we
make our trek there and we get there and
about
the day after we go to the funeral home
and we begin to make the arrangements
and unfortunately some of the things
that my sister wanted the funeral people
didn&#39;t have prepared and I began to get
frustrated now already mama my heart is
already broken and I&#39;m wounded and my
emotions afraid but it was interesting
to me that my son Dominic he says dad no
I&#39;ll take care of it not really I&#39;ll
take care of it pause and he began to
intervene on my behalf he began to do
some things and say some things that I
recognized at that moment that he was my
father I recognized the very things that
were looking for the the provision the
protection the praise all those things
were coming out and the very one that I
was supposed to be fathering he began to
father me my point in this whole
circumstance is that all of us have that
desperate need all of us have that
desire to recognize that we&#39;re of worth
now when that happened to me
it caused a healing in my heart because
see there&#39;s a father wound in nationally
and internationally father wound that
only father&#39;s can feel I&#39;m gonna ask
something ask something great of you
your father&#39;s your dads that are out
there I want you to stand up now whether
you had a father or not stand up now I
want you to do me a favor
man I see this is a global issue the
global problem a global issue a global
thing in which only men are the answer
like I said before our our daughters
they need us our families they need us
they need us and so I&#39;m going to ask
something great of you men now I want
you each to close your eyes and I want
you to do this I want you to picture the
best father only to picture the
best dad only to picture him encouraging
you telling you he&#39;s proud of you
telling you that you&#39;re the best now I
want you to think on that and I want you
to meditate on that because see it&#39;s a
global min problem and it&#39;s where the
answer to that global issue now keep
them stay focused man now this is what I
challenge you and I need for you to do
go and be that very thing that you&#39;ve
just envisioned to those around you
because it will change the trajectory of
their lives all you need to do it is be
compassionate all you need to do is be
willing to step outside of your comfort
zone and you can change the lives of
many to this very day I have young men
and older men calling me saying thank
you very much for intervening in my life
when I needed to hear some positive
enforcement some positive confirmation
may be seated in the mid 90s
there was a movie that came out that I
really enjoyed just called boys in the
hood and I really liked the movie I
really did it was about a young man
coming to age and his mother was kind he
was getting kind of unruly with his mom
and the mother said you need to go live
with your dad so of course she calls the
Pops and he says yes listen listen I
need to talk with him and it was funny
because he one day in the scene he grabs
his son and he takes him outside and
says I want you to rake these leaves and
he sees his friends his his buddies and
sons buddies across the way and he says
he calls him over and says hey we need
to me a favor one yeah when you guys
rake these leaves I&#39;ll give you five
bucks for it says guy says the kids say
and five bucks ain&#39;t and I&#39;ll let you
fill in the blanks
and he said they leave and he looks at
his son he&#39;s his son I know that you
think I&#39;m being hard on you but I&#39;m
trying to teach you responsibility you
see those guys over there they don&#39;t
have a father and you&#39;re gonna see how
they end up now the movie was great and
this character played a great role but
the frustrating thing I had about that
is is that he pronounced the prophesy
over their lives
he declared something over them they
said you&#39;re gonna see how they end up
and unfortunately they ended up the very
way he thought they would question is
this how much more finances would have
been taken him to simply take them with
his son fishing to take them with with
with his son as he takes them bowling or
takes him to their job his job
how much more finances would have would
have taken the eternal difference that
could have taken place as a result of
him going outside of his comfort zone
and beginning to invite those young men
would have changed their lives again I
am the executive director of crisis
pregnancy center and again on a daily
basis I see the negative impact of
fatherlessness and these young ladies
are desperately looking for someone now
it&#39;s amazing to me I talked to some of
the the caseworkers of some of the
former ladies who are in prostitution
and they say this they said you know
what they&#39;re healing exponentially
increases when a strong father figure is
in their lives not looking at them with
wanting eyes but encouraging them and
letting them know how valuable they
really are all of us desire to hear that
especially our daughters again I say
that I&#39;m not taking anything from our
moms but the issues that we&#39;re facing on
a global perspective has everything to
do with father listen if you&#39;ve heard
the numbers then there was just a few of
the stats I say this in closing and I
ask you this
in closing be the far
that you&#39;ve always wanted be the dad
that you&#39;ve just envisioned to others
and not only will you heal them you will
by curiously father yourself through
fathering others it is a win-win
situation so I asked asked you men take
it up and stand because in you things
can change in you a life that is going
one direction can be changed by some
positive affirmation from a father I am
passionate about this I am unbelievably
focused on this because I seek daily the
desperate need for fathers to step up
and live in the lives of those who
desperately need affirmation and
encouragement thank you very much
[Applause]
