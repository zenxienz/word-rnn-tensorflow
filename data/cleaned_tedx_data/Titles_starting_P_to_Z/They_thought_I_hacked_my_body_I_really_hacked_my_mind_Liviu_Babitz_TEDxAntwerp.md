hello everybody my name is Livia bavitz
I&#39;m a human being just like you guys but
I have a new sense
I have a new piece of technology
attached to my body just here with two
titanium rods that are inserted into my
chest so people say liviou why did you
do that how did you get to that into
your life to put a new piece of
technology that nonsense attached to
your body there were three revolutions
in my life that I would like to share
with you that were part of it so you
know when you&#39;re born and you are a kid
everything is possible in life
everything is doable everything is it&#39;s
just there everything can happen
everything can superheroes exist Santa
Claus exists everything exists you are
an endless world of opportunities but I
was born in Romania in the 90s in the
80s sorry 1980 which was probably the
darkest ages of Eastern Europe back in
the days and yes I was a kid and I was
very happy and I had this happy
childhood with my family but the reality
out there was very different
there was this endless wall standing in
front of us that said no you&#39;re not
allowed to do that and you&#39;re not
allowed to do that and you have to wear
the party uniforms when you go to school
and you have to be like everybody else
so it was really very different from the
way that I was a kid that I was I was
thinking about this world of endless
opportunities but then in 1999
everything changed for me I saw
thousands hundreds of thousands of
people walking to the streets and taking
and going to break that wall and saying
no the impossible is going to be breakin
and we&#39;re going to break it and they did
it and yes the regime changed and that
was a big change but for me as a kid the
biggest change was seeing that the
impossible is possible that it can be
done that it can be different that we
can change big things in life and that
was my first revolution when they came
big change in my life and we moved to
Israel and I grew up near the Dead Sea
in the desert at a very remote place but
it was the 90s and and suddenly
technology boomed and Israel was always
a front of in front of the technology
world and the big part of it so
everything spread very fast and I saw it
happening I saw this thing happening and
coming to change the world and I was
part of it although again I was in a
very very small place in a very remote
place so being exposed to technology
throughout my mic adolescence and then I
went to the army like everybody else
does in Israel I studied I was exposed
to different cultures and different ways
of seeing life and I was I thought well
they thought I was ready for that job
you know what parents would expect you
to do but I don&#39;t think that was the
reality for me I wasn&#39;t really ready for
that job I wanted to do something I
wanted to to change I kept dreaming
about these people on the streets making
the change and because technology was
was such a big part of everything that
was happening I knew the technology is
here yes it&#39;s cool and games and all
that but at the end of the day it&#39;s here
to make a good change in the world to
create impact so I joined the Darius
credit which is today probably the
edgiest human rights organization I was
the CEO of this organization I worked
undercover for five years many people in
the world know me by many names and we
equipped people in places where no one
but no one has access to with little
pieces of technology that they could
record and document the things that are
happening now think about it we live in
a world where we have everything is out
there everything is exposed real news
fake news everything we know well just
so you know there are many places where
you know not
about them because there are people that
make sure that nothing will come out of
there and whatever bad things and
atrocities that are happening to these
people they make sure that you don&#39;t
know about it but we change that and
using little pieces of technology these
people have a voice today and you&#39;ve all
seen footage and images and recordings
of these people these brave people you
never knew it&#39;s us because we have to
keep it secret but they have a voice and
that was my second revolution and then I
became a father and everybody said okay
what&#39;s gonna be next maybe now it&#39;s time
for that job for that pinger like normal
just you know waking up in the morning
and going somewhere and not getting
killed maybe or not doing something
really crazy what I think you already
know me and it didn&#39;t happen and then I
thought okay what is what is that next
thing that he was untouched can you see
what we could reinvent ourselves as
humans I create a real real big change
and we live in a world where we create
smarter homes smarter phones smarter
cars everything around us is getting
smarter except us okay there is no
technology that attaches to us that
creates us smarter as humans it made
some friends and some people and we
understood that at the end of the day
it&#39;s our senses that are responsible for
everything that we ever created as
humans everything we went once on a pond
up on a hill and we saw and we said wow
this is where I want my house and we
built it we smelled something and we
decided to make a certain type of food
out of it we heard that bird singing and
it was amazing so we created music
everything that we created we created
because
these senses otherwise our brain as a
processor it&#39;s the smartest thing that
we know but it would have been locked in
a box with no way to connect to reality
it&#39;s our senses that create that
connection in that interaction between
us and what we call life so think about
it in this room where we are now there
are endless things that we cannot sense
there are colors there are sounds
infrared the magnetic field of the
planet pollution subsonic endless things
here not there not in space in this room
where I speak now and we have no idea
about them now imagine yourself if we
could sense those things if we could be
part of it we could create a completely
different world and we could upgrade and
create a smarter humanity so going back
to my little nerd sense I have it now
for nine months and yes every time I
face North which is that direction I get
a little vibration and that little
vibration created new memories created
new feelings created new ways of
understanding space I know that that
direction is the direction of my home is
the direction of this is the way that my
kid enters his school in the morning
every place that I&#39;ve been since I have
the north sense I remember it by how
it&#39;s located on the planet and all these
places are now little maps is are
starting to connect together into my
brain and into the way that I perceive
space so if we had more senses as humans
we could live and much richer life
experience we could understand things
that we did not understand before we
could we could solve problems that we
don&#39;t have solutions for because we
would sense those things now I know
now I know that there is a lot of fear
from technology and people say yes
technology is going to take over and
technology is going to destroy us and
and we&#39;re going to become the pets of
our technology and all these things I
don&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve seen with my
eyes and I did with my own hands I use
technology to create change and people
around me and people that are part of me
part of my life and part of the things
that I do know that this is the truth
don&#39;t be afraid of things that are that
you&#39;ve been told it&#39;s all about the way
that we tell the story it&#39;s all about
the way that we use the technology it&#39;s
asked to decide how this world is going
to be built and it&#39;s asked to decide
what kind of future we are going to
create with this technology and
technology is here to create good and
this is my third revolution and they
welcome you to join me
