I&#39;m a fake feminist I come here all
needs and Freddie on stage with my high
heels on and my warm smile to preach the
good gospel of gender equity as a tool
of liberation for both men and women but
let&#39;s be honest I might just be cashing
in on a very juicy and burst trend I
might still be falling for emotionally
unavailable men I might as well still
treat my colleagues or coworkers with
the same capitalist competitive gene
that is so entrenched in all of us I
might just be a fraud or not being a
feminist in 2017 is walking a very thin
line on one side you have the trolls and
cyberbully are sending you hate messages
on social media and on the other side
your peers your friends your family who
is questioning this why are you so
passionate about this topic there are so
many times that I ask myself how
legitimate I am really am i speaking
truth or am i cynically or even
unconsciously tapping into this trend
and taking advantage of it for my own
selfish benefit and visibility it&#39;s a
hard question to answer I don&#39;t think
anybody here is 100% altruistic or free
from ego
especially by the way we&#39;ve been raised
so it&#39;s very hard to be a 100% pure race
feminists but we can try and we can keep
each other in check and when I&#39;m in
doubt I think about the five-year-old me
if you want a last little overly what
she wanted the most as a gift she would
have said peace peace and balance I
hated conflict when I would hear my
parents fight I would pray for hours to
make it stop when I was at the dinner
table I would feel the need to intervene
between them to balance their energies
to channel the conversation rephrased
the conversation the phrases that in
words so that they wouldn&#39;t hurt each
other that much I hated the poison of
Spears the bleeding wants so I observed
I listened and I could feel their deep
pain below their anger I could feel that
my mom just wanted a more balanced
marriage with more love and appreciation
and I could feel that my dad would have
loved to escape from the pressure of the
family business and his overwhelming
father but they couldn&#39;t they were
trapped in their respective boxes my dad
was trapped in a man box he was supposed
to provide for the family he was
supposed to be tough even if he was a
kid at heart he was supposed to cope
with his father&#39;s constant criticism
prove his value without receiving any
word of appreciation and my mom was
trapped in a woman box a very smart
educated woman in managing the household
and bored to death in a rural remote
village giving away her career
aspirations and travel plans
and as I grew up I realized that this
personal story was actually a system at
one from the rural villages of south of
France to the cities of Pakistan the
symptoms might be different but the
disease is the same because we all live
in a matrix so embedded in us that we
are completely oblivious about it
we even deny its existence we live in a
world of fear and domination the world
based on war and aggression where the
stats of military spending are actually
up to eight times the stats of education
spending if we would stop spending on
military for only eight days we could
provide and pay for the education of
each child on the planet for 12 years a
world of deep individual suffering
because to prepare people to this world
we actually Mitchell aid them to carve
them into these boxes from a very young
age with devaluate women it&#39;s a girl is
still 11 world in many places parents
and teachers interrupt girls twice as
much as boys we train our girl to engage
into quieter and calmer activities we
train them to conform and obey very soon
and we train our boys through our ads
through media from your language to
fight to address any conflict with
violence to disconnect from their
emotions unless it&#39;s anger we trap
people into narratives women shouldn&#39;t
be loud women are too emotional to lead
women don&#39;t write that well
and Men mint on gray man of strong men
don&#39;t feel pain and these matrix goes
very deep or meta stories are biased or
myths or religion our stories are
written by men about men or about women
with a male gaze so we only see half of
the story today
Millennials are asking for renewed
gender roles but what do they see when
they look around them they go to night
club and listen to blurred lines I know
you want it right you dance that I won -
I did - they see Donald Trump running
the world they see master street
harassment in India or in chrome toxic
masculinity shooting people everywhere
we&#39;re reaching the limit of a system the
domination model is threatening the
whole humankind a world where half of
the population is trained to oppress the
other half is not a happy place both
sexes are slaves to each other so what
can we do about it well the first step
is to reclaim the narrative worlds or
magical worlds or powerful words are
free they&#39;re available to anyone and
those who tell the stories are actually
those who ruled the world so what is
your story the story you choose to tell
not the one that others have invented
for you your family your friends your
colleagues the media whoever and I&#39;m
especially talking to women here because
we are especially targeted by negative
narratives what is your true story
honestly truly without an overinflated
sense of self-esteem or under estimated
why
who do you want to be and then the
second step for me is to engage in
collective action for years I&#39;ve been
researching positive project solutions
to balance this world and what is
fantastic is that new media is offering
us new tools to shift the way gender and
social activism has been done it&#39;s more
fun it&#39;s more fast it&#39;s faster is
accessible to anyone it can be called it
can be questioned by for its depth for
its impact but I find it actually
fascinating these crossroads between
deep systemic social change and fun fast
visual tools suddenly conversation which
has had been confined to very
intellectual spheres go viral and today
more than ever we need everyone to be a
change maker so in the city where
supposedly Hermione&#39;s has been created I
would say that this trend that can be
called cool feminism has many magic
wands in his toolkit one of them is
humor humor is very powerful there are
different website one of them is
all-male panels where for example if you
go to a conference where you actually
see an all-male panel you can take a
picture and upload them on that tumblr
and then you have a nice picture of
David Hasselhoff with a thumbs up
telling you yeah you made it or you have
this Twitter or Facebook account called
man who has it all which actually uses
different images and phrases and
switches the rules and you have for
example an image of a man playing the
guitar and just saying oh man too
emotional to deal with political issues
we have new channels like ATT and
BuzzFeed ag+ which produce short viral
videos of 1-2 minutes tackling a subject
that was once buried in world&#39;s economic
forum reports like the pay gap and this
video that you might have seen about the
woman discovering the pay gap and who
actually decides to work only 78 percent
of the day
so she speaks and then she doesn&#39;t
finish the sentences in the middle of a
meeting or she just backs off of her
conference call ten minutes before the
end she&#39;s like I&#39;m only paid for 78
percent so it&#39;s reductivism Gary luck
tourism is an interesting way of doing
things and making change as well in
Paris only 2% of the streets are named
after women 2% so a group decided to
take matters in their own hands and they
took different images and pasted them
all around Paris like Kay Nina Simone
and sweet Frida Kahlo and again this is
simple cheap but makes people think
technology is helping us to leverage the
power of the crowd it&#39;s changing the way
activism is done
suddenly platforms like change.org allow
parents to question the brand&#39;s who
actually try to sell sexist t-shirts for
example now I&#39;m a hero I want to marry a
hero like the Avengers one all these new
tools or helping us to balance the world
but for me where these cool feminism
trend is going beyond is alleged
superficiality and blamed fakeness is
when it actually changed the stories
when it engages contour storytelling
because how do you create a system of
oppression you create stories to back it
up to legitimate it you create content
and with your science are the voices and
how do you destroy a system of
oppression by new stories if you want to
change the world you have to change the
stories so we need more female
storytellers to tell the other side of
the story we need women to grab a mic to
grab a pen to grab a camera to show
their reality to leverage the power of
images to impact people visually
emotionally to use new media like
YouTube channels news
letters podcasts to have an impact and
to convert the world in collective of
changemakers because now more than ever
we have a collective duty of activism
and we have the tools to make it happen
we have a collective duty to reframe and
rethink or unconscious biases the songs
we listen to the words we use the media
we watch the shoes we buy we have to
shift from a domination to a partnership
model to question the oppressor within
us to pass from the blade to the chalice
from Darth Vader to Luke and Leia
Skywalker and we have to be all each one
of us part of this solution even if they
call us fake Gandhi used to say at the
beginning they ignore you after they
laugh at you after they fight you and
after you win small situations can lead
to massive system transformation a new
world is possible based on trust and
love because at the end of the day what
stories do is that they connect with our
shared humanity we are one I am you you
are me and deep down we all love no
matter what they told us so now is the
time to create this mass this critical
mass of new stories to build a new
archetype because it&#39;s a vital quest
it&#39;s the spiritual one so that we can
all finally find peace and balance
