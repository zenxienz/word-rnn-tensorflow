you
[Music]
thank you let me start with giving you
some numbers on 2015 19 point 5 million
students joined University across the
European Union distributed along
bachelor&#39;s master&#39;s and doctoral studies
eleven point nine percent of these
students were here in the UK who we
invest significant amount of money in
infrastructure for studies and education
0.5% of the GDP to be precise and you
can find similar numbers all around
Europe on investment for this despite
all of this we fail to capitalize this
we fail to create value we have nearly
20 million students joining universities
every year and yet we don&#39;t manage to
create the new leonardo&#39;s the new graham
bell&#39;s the new Galileo&#39;s at scale
universities should be providing the
ecosystem necessary to drive creative
knowledge and original discoveries the
main objective of university is to
educate and create research it is to
push students and researchers to the
cutting edge of thinking it is to
provide an ecosystem needed for critical
and creative thinking it is to challenge
the way we do things right now
after twelve years in university I can
see that both education and research are
far from achieving this students are
rarely challenged to collaborate with
different environments and to share
their ideas this is essential to connect
ideas in the 21st century most of you
students come to University and you&#39;re
used to interaction with the use of
social media
instant action-reaction yet you put
yourself from the time machine and go
back in time
you&#39;re sitting on a university classroom
I were just there
listening there is no interaction on the
research side I see that there is a
profound disengagement between
researchers or academics and the core
management structures this creates an
environment that strongly dissent avise
innovation as well we don&#39;t collaborate
with different industries and we
certainly do not collaborate among our
internal faculties and research centers
when I was doing my master&#39;s degrees and
my bachelor&#39;s I have the opportunity to
learn from professors who are actively
doing research on the topics they were
they were teaching us the way my
university approach learning was very
different from traditional universities
it was called the project-based learning
at the beginning of each course we were
challenged with a real-life research
problem and by the end of the course we
had to provide a technological solution
original solution as part of a final
project for every course during my five
years of bachelor and master&#39;s by
creating knowledge through researching
we cultivate creativity and we bring our
students to think critically which
nurtures innovation that was planted in
all of us during our masters and
bachelor&#39;s universities should bring
students to be a part of the major
disruptions we are living nowadays if
students are part of this then they will
be nurtured by research and innovation
from day one and they would like to join
us in the role of academic research
after four years of working in academia
I finished my PhD and I found myself
that most of that time I was working on
complex mathematical analysis that
probably no one will
and building technological solutions
that the industry will never look at
kind of a lot of time right not really
anyway this was very good for publishing
and if there is any academic here in the
room they will understand when I say
that our major master it&#39;s not
disruption is to publish no matter what
deadline is approaching we have to
publish something well to me that&#39;s not
innovation that&#39;s not disruption and
certainly that does not help society
understand why we are building these
complex systems my next role in academia
was far more appealing we actually went
out of the world and start asking people
why do you need technology how can
technology help your everyday business
we were talking to the artists to the
doctors to the engineers and tell them
how can we make technology generate
value in your everyday business I was
finally working in the highly dynamic
innovative and creative environment that
I thought academia was well I didn&#39;t
have much time to publish it is very
difficult to publish this kind of work
in renowned journalist and also all the
brand&#39;s I was working on they were they
went to somebody else to be managed
essentially because I am NOT a lecturer
so according to university rating
standards I had achieved very little in
these two years based on my experience I
see the main problem of universities and
academic research being the following
the way we value academic research is
based on publications citations and
grounds now let me ask you this question
and let&#39;s think about it how do we
disrupt industries from academia doing
this how do we put the bear
mine&#39;s in the world assuming they&#39;re
still in university to solve real-life
problems that can help both society and
industries more importantly how do we do
all of this while being a lecturer well
I&#39;d like to challenge that I think that
I have achieved more technological
disruption in these two years of King&#39;s
College that know my accumulated work in
the past I think that when you engage
with industries you establish your
research priorities and it helps you to
be the first ones many things I also
think that universities are the ideal
environment to disrupt industries and
create new ideas we offer a neutral
position who don&#39;t want a commercial
outcome we want to change things how do
we are done if we engage with industries
they are so rigid that their commercial
outcome is so important that they will
never change current business models
approaches or even think about creative
new solutions so we can educate creative
thought in both society and industry and
the most important part of all we have
access to skill set the same way I was
attracted by university searching for a
dynamic innovative and changing
environment we have a fresh new batch of
20 million students joining University
every year with similar interests its
motivate them at the same time I see
many advantages of changing the way we
approach research in universities first
of all we can increase branding build
profile and increase credibility
when doing the complicated math and
writing papers it is important if we are
not able to make society understand why
we are doing this it loses its value for
example you can write a paper about
haptic communications using
software-defined networks or you can go
ahead and build a system and show the
world how a surgeon can do robotic
surgery and still feel the sense of
touch we have done that and the public
was amazed when they could see what
technology could achieve we also wrote
the paper as well but it&#39;s important to
have the two sides of the story once we
have increased branding we have built
our profile and our credibility is good
then industries will come and work with
us because they want our creative and
critical thinking and that in the end is
formed in strong collaboration strong
partnerships and these are private
funded projects for universities which
lets us have more people more
researchers working with us ultimately
universities want to be leaders which in
the end is having high number of
students enrolling every year and be in
the forefront of research so if we bring
our students and make them work in real
life problems it means that we are
creating the skill set that the market
meets and eventually students will like
to come and work with us just because we
are fulfilling that objective take for
example the MIT and the media labs
culture of demo or time versus the
publish or perish of regular academia
it&#39;s something to think about so with
all of this what I mind my message here
is that we have to work together
academics and core University structure
and to understand that we are here to
help each other to help us grow
it has to be a win-win case let&#39;s change
the way we recruit talent they said not
everyone wants to be a lecture but yet
we want to work in academic research the
way University values our work we are
focused on outreach rather than in
publications limits our career and we
are forced to leave let&#39;s build
processes administrative processes that
are flexible enough to let us grow to
let us adapt to the dynamism of
technological disruption of nowadays and
by this I mean changing the entire
structure of administrative procedures
within universities we produce more
science graduates and PhD students than
the academic positions can fill at the
end of the day we have a lot of talent
that has no clear path if we embrace
this if we change the way we we educate
if we change the way we approach
research then we can have a place for
all these people and then we can disrupt
them can disrupt technology we can build
new companies it&#39;s changed the way we
teach let&#39;s change the way we recruit
talent it&#39;s changed the way we approach
academic research because one thing is
true we could do it much much better
thank you very much
