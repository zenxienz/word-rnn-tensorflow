there we go okay so got it so I just got
married in February and it&#39;s been it&#39;s
been a rollercoaster it&#39;s been amazing I
love it
my crazy husband&#39;s in here somewhere so
I also recently became vegan as it like
the last couple of months - oh yeah okay
cool there&#39;s some of you guys out there
so we go to the farmers market the
DeKalb farmers market and I we love
sweet potatoes because that&#39;s like the
one thing we have in common that we both
love
and so we&#39;re shopping for these sweet
potatoes and next to the sweet potatoes
if you&#39;ve been to the farmers market
there&#39;s there&#39;s well there&#39;s tons of
everything everywhere DeKalb farmer&#39;s
market this is not a sponsor but when we
were there looking for these sweet
potatoes we saw this thing next to the
sweet potatoes called a boniato and I&#39;m
like ooh what is that and Alex didn&#39;t
know and so I was like alright cool
boniato he says let&#39;s get it and try it
out so we bought this bunny I so threw
it in the refrigerator I think it&#39;s
still in there anyways on our way home
I was on our way home once we bought the
bunny ah - I was sitting at a red light
and I was thinking man boniato I wonder
what a boniato would be like in real
life red light thoughts and this is a
symptom of synesthesia we personify
everything so I&#39;m sitting at a red light
thinking what a sweet potato would be
like as a person so then I was like hmm
I think a bunny Otto would be really
cool really adventurous so then this
melody popped in my head and it went
something like
[Music]
so my god oh is this as boniato zone
so I was doing that and then I was like
who
so I was like oh wow this is a song
about boniato maybe he&#39;s trying to like
tell me something look guys I&#39;m not
crazy I promise this is just my
imagination but it was real life so so
