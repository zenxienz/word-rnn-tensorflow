do you listen to the voices in your head
have you ever called yourself stupid
patting yourself on the back for a job
well done or looked into the mirror and
said I look fantastic
my name is Boris Turner and I&#39;m your
motivational hypnotist and I&#39;m here to
tell you that your mind that would be me
and I&#39;m here to tell you that your mind
is such a marvelous thing we all live in
a wonderful world because hypnosis is
almost like you&#39;ll go a bird game of
Simon Says except my name is Boris but
the fact there&#39;s two parts of the mind
there&#39;s the conscious and then there&#39;s
the subconscious and the conscious is
the reasoning the filter that all the
suggestions are coming through they let
them pass or they don&#39;t let them pass
and the subconscious or something that I
will refer to as a trance that is always
there you all live in a trance
guided by negativity and even fears now
hypnosis starts long before you hear a
hypnotist mentioned the word sleep it&#39;s
an interesting process because what
actually happens is people focus so well
they&#39;re really focused so well that they
concentrate on something so well that it
becomes reality to them and you live
that way all of your life James Randi
describes hypnosis as an agreement
between two people to fantasize together
well let&#39;s get into the fantasy part of
it both of you wide awake we have with
that Sir Michael and Elora we got a
chance to spend a little bit of time
together beforehand and speaking about
imagination
imagine very vividly that in my hand I&#39;m
holding a string to that string there&#39;s
a large helium balloon
and what color do you like Michael you
like blue here&#39;s a blue balloon for you
it&#39;s a helium balloon so it&#39;ll take your
hand right up towards the ceiling all by
itself what color would you like you
would like blue as well maybe orange
yellow
I&#39;d pick any color what&#39;s a red balloon
here we go here&#39;s a red balloon right
here and hang on to this one and they
will take your hands right up towards
the ceiling all by themselves and not
only the imagination is so wonderful you
can actually visualize and control your
own destiny your own every day and then
just put it right down it&#39;s got a neat
that it&#39;s funny to what extent we can
actually imagine the things and they
focus so well that they actually
completely bypass reasoning and anything
else and they focus so well I can even
talk in front of them that&#39;s how well
they focus now you are all imprinted
from the day you were born because your
mind is a computer you not only are
aware of what&#39;s going on but you&#39;re
actually imprinted with the information
my background in psychology and
computers so what it is literally the
two don&#39;t seem related but they are your
mind works
you blink you everything is being
controlled from one source and it&#39;s
controlled to the point where I
you aren&#39;t printed with the information
that will make it very difficult for you
to read there to read this sign which
actually is a neon sign with different
colors from the Science Center in
Toronto or better yet this one simply
your mind is readjusting your own
programming and you are controlling it
and reprogramming it right on this spot
and and both feet
in both feet deep asleep now deepest
level asleep now now the only thing that
I&#39;m here to tell you that the trance
it&#39;s always there the trance will always
be there the only thing that&#39;s an add on
is the consciousness though the
conscious is likely the add-on that is
either turned on or off now when I wake
you up when I wake you up in just a
second
let&#39;s give us something to do we have
Michael and Elora Michael wanna wake you
up when I wake you up in just a second
for one reason or another your right
shoe has become a cell phone that you
can take selfies with and boy do you
ever like selfies for one reason or
another you will love to take a selfie
especially when my back is turned you
want to get one in and Ellora when I
wake you up
you are the safety person for this
theater so you always make sure that
everything is safe and if any chance
it&#39;s not you let us know there&#39;s a
microphone on the side on your left so
you&#39;ll be able to let the audience know
if anything is not up to par now we
guide ourselves all day long through
repetition and we repeat things
constantly it works on it if
if-then-else just like a computer
principle what you are able to take
whatever it is there and at some point
in times you may have wanted to work on
something overnight there do you have a
gut feeling about stuff so I&#39;m telling
you that everything is working
constantly at all times
there&#39;s stimuli that are coming in at
you and your brain is processing those
stimuli so this is exactly why when you
leave a problem overnight often you wake
up with a solution and both of you wide
awake is a safety person and the shoe
selfie phone no I&#39;m sorry what&#39;s going
let me just grab a microphone now to
make sure what is going on here I need
to check and make sure there&#39;s no
trapdoors under here I&#39;m the safety
person Oh
yes I haven&#39;t be sure but I kind of move
on so is that okay Michael wide-awake
it&#39;s all right there&#39;s no trapdoors I
garden certain then go ahead and please
sit down I&#39;m just trying to move on with
this clicker thing and all I&#39;m here to
tell you that when you program yourself
yeah why don&#39;t you hold on to this I
have a mic oh and I&#39;m here to tell you
that not only do you program yourself
but you actually do it with constant
repetition
that&#39;s why daily lists make such a
wonderful thing to motivate each one and
every one of you you have some
commercials and the repetition of those
commercials gets you to get acquainted
with a product and constant repetition
you walk up to a counter I have this
Anna whatever that the product might be
and by repetition you&#39;re able to
constantly convince yourself so the
answer to when somebody asks you how are
you should always be fantastic
everything good into the microphone yes
I&#39;m not sure that everything&#39;s safe it&#39;s
my job here as the safety person to make
sure that everything is sealed off right
and Michael I like that you did you take
enough
now we can even control our moods to the
point where you can switch instantly
on-the-fly sometimes you feel depressed
at those times you can actually change
absolutely everything that happens in
your life from the feeling down to
feeling up for example right here the
both of you let us think and everything
is starting to become absolutely
hilarious starting now and you know that
laughter is contagious inspect from one
person to another and the only thing
that you do is when you concentrate you
concentrates so well the same way
everything is absolutely serious now
that&#39;s exactly how things work now I&#39;m
sure some of you may recognize this
sound within this theater and it&#39;s
really imperative that you get towards
the exit right now you&#39;re gonna have to
start moving excuse me serious danger
there&#39;s been a shark sighting and we
need to go to the exit to the shark
attack records and Mashable&#39;s you
actually have a better chance of getting
killed well for the theater there are
two exits three exit there&#39;s really no
alarm and please go ahead and sit what
are you doing I see well put your shoe
back on the end please both of you
freeze but not only can you
literally freeze the moment but this is
the coolest part in the whole
presentation you could actually wave a
hand in front of their face and the eyes
won&#39;t even move to swatch isn&#39;t that
neat
in both of you deep asleep now in deep
asleep now for quite a few years I had a
chance of being a regular guest expert
on the Maury show helping people with
weird and unusual eye fears and phobias
and I got a lot of sight into this
because not only did I figure out that
phobias well let me tell you a little
bit about phobias phobias and fears they
trigger a response from each and every
one of you and that we all have a
response to whatever it is and on the
show we had two schools of thought there
was one where there were faced with a
fear is something called flooding and
then they were given to me to help them
with the actual fear through hypnosis
and one thing that I found that there
was actually quite interesting is that
fear is learned you do not get a fear
you actually learned to be afraid if as
a child you touch a hot stove next time
you think twice about it and we have
different reasons why we have a fear
weather don&#39;t like or misunderstand
something we do it for self-preservation
or oddly enough it&#39;s passed down along
from an authority figure and somebody
like your parent or somebody just
imagine if your mother jumped on top of
a chair when she saw a mouse you would
be doing exactly the same thing and we
actually had a lady that brought her
mother on the show who literally ended
up being treated for the same thing
herself where you know it was passed
along this
way we are constantly surrounded also by
negativity a UCLA study at some point in
time figured out that an average toddler
hears the word no more than four hundred
times a day and it&#39;s up to you to change
all of the nose in your life to the
point where you are changing this nose
into a yes and I actually call it
prophetic thinking imagine your future
and watch it materialize so the success
is within your hands it&#39;s always there
you just never actually put it there&#39;s
so much negativity that you&#39;re picking
negativity out of the air and calling it
your own
I live by four simple words it&#39;s a
mantra that I actually took into my life
and those words are you can do anything
there&#39;s no such thing as impossible
there&#39;s too many suggestions coming from
the outside world that tell you that you
can&#39;t you can do anything I really mean
that and the reason I say that is
because there are fierce you create them
yourself the more you get caught up in
the negativity the more you start
spiraling down the same thing is
opposite impossible where you actually
concentrate on the positive in your life
because there&#39;s no way for you just like
what I&#39;m gonna do in just a second to be
that negative the negativity is what
drives you all the time if you watch the
news it&#39;s not always about good news
that&#39;s why most of you are here watching
the presentation but the TEDx right here
today and when I wake you up when I wake
both of you up it&#39;s part of meditation
part of your internal dialog when I wake
you up both of you are feeling fantastic
you&#39;re feeling better than you ever have
before they&#39;re already feeling
re-energized this silly suggestions are
completely removed from your mind and
you&#39;re feeling great all of the
negatives that you want to change in
your mind have changed
two positives becoming more and more
aware of your surroundings body no
longer heavy feeling great and
absolutely wide awake now why do we now
you have the control the answer is right
there right in front of you it always
has been you just have to see it it&#39;s
all about your emotional success
