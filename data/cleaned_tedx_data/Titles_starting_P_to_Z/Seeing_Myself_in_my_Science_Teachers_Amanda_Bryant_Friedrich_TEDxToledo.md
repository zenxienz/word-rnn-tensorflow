four decades ago yes I know I don&#39;t look
that old the universe decided to put me
on a journey that was going to fill my
life with mystery and intrigue you see
my mother was very ill she would get up
out of bed only to go to the doctor she
would go to the doctor and she would
come home with pills bottles of pills
for seven years my mother would get up
and go to the doctor and come home with
pills at some point as a wee
nine-year-old I thought to myself why
are these medications not working
they&#39;re supposed to cure her why don&#39;t I
see her getting out of that bed
well eventually she did but I kept
thinking to myself medications need to
cure people they need to help people get
better so I guess that&#39;s when I decided
that was going to be my mission my
intellectual mission was going to be to
go find new medications for people and
so I decided then to go off to college
and become a chemistry major so I looked
around when I got to college I was
excited I was like oh this is gonna be
awesome there was no one there like me
now I went to a historically black
college in North Carolina there were
plenty of people around me who look like
me they shared my race they shared my
ethnicity a lot of them share my
religion but very few of them
actually shared my very low level of
economic and social privilege they also
didn&#39;t share my ridiculous passion for
making new medications and being
innovated in a Discoverer when I
recognized that I said huh let me look
around and look at my professors well
my professors weren&#39;t like me either
they were mostly white male they didn&#39;t
share my ethnicity they didn&#39;t share my
religion but they had the privilege of
the knowledge that I wanted so I said to
myself who is going to train Amanda then
a professor came to me one day and he
said you seemed to love organic
chemistry I know there are a lot of
people here who love organic chemistry
why don&#39;t you come in my lab and do some
organic chemistry and make some new
molecules Wow a dream come true so he
became my mentor this was a tall white
guy from Tennessee he had a Tennessee
accent like you wouldn&#39;t believe but he
knew how important it was to me to
fulfill the dream I had of being able to
treat people to give new drugs to
pharmacists I didn&#39;t want to sell the
drugs in the pharmacy I didn&#39;t want to
be the doctor I wanted to make those
compounds so he recognized that I was
very ill prepared I felt like I was
walking in the fog in a forest all by
myself then there were no people there
to help me so he taught me how to learn
he gave me the resources that I needed
he recognized that I needed experience
so he brought internships to me and he
put me in them he sat next to
me once at a dinner where we had Lobster
I had never seen a lobster before in my
life
I didn&#39;t know what to do with that thing
so he said a man that just look around
and do what everybody else does and he
helped me learn how to do that today
we&#39;re all told that we need mentors
black folks white folks young folks old
folks girls and boys men and women but
what our mentors really that&#39;s what I
want to talk to you about what kinds of
mentors are there out there and who are
these people that you need to help you
walk through that path in the fog and
find your way a mentor helps you in a
way that no one else can it&#39;s a very
personal relationship that is based on
trust understanding and open dialog you
owe it to your mentor to make sure that
they know the things about you that they
need to know to help you be successful
but one of the most important things
your mentor needs to accept you as an
individual and when I say as an
individual I mean someone who has their
own mind their own characteristics they
need to be able to accept the fact that
you have chosen to raise children or
that you&#39;ve chosen not to they need to
accept that you&#39;ve chosen to transition
from male to female female to male they
need to accept that you embrace your own
ethnicity your religion and your faith
those individuals have to be on board to
accept all
of those things about you they need to
know your past they need to know your
present they need to know where you&#39;re
going and what drives you and what your
mission really is that mentor is the one
that also recognized that as life
continues you&#39;re going to change your
needs will change and they will be the
ones to help you find out what you need
next now there are different kinds of
mentors there&#39;s that advocate this is
the mentor who is standing behind you on
the sidelines they know what you know
how to do they know when you&#39;re ready
and they push you into the game to make
sure that you get the playing time that
you need so that you can show the world
how good you are and then when you start
to get all of those wins because you&#39;re
out there you&#39;re playing they know when
to pull you back and sit you down in the
chair because you need a rest they are
the ones who are there then they&#39;re that
going to be the mentor who&#39;s going to
sit down next to you and teach you how
to eat lobster they&#39;re not gonna do that
but they&#39;re the ones who are out there
who are advocating for your success what
do advocates do they work for a cause
when you find your advocate their cause
is you now they&#39;re giving you something
they&#39;re giving you something they&#39;re
giving you time they&#39;re giving you
energy and they&#39;re giving you a part of
their reputation this is a major thing
so you have to remember what you owe to
your advocates when they are helping you
along the way now there&#39;s another kind
of mentor this one is your champion even
when you&#39;re not in the room your
champion is talking about you that
person needs to know you in
credibly well and they need to be there
to use their intellectual capital their
social capital their economic capital to
get you where you need to go you need a
champion especially when you&#39;ve gotten
all of those wins and it&#39;s time for you
to gain recognition we all want to be
recognized don&#39;t we we all want to get a
promotion we all want an award the only
way that you can do that is to have a
champion now you might be asking
yourself she&#39;s up there talking about
all of these mentors why do people need
Mentors what is all of that about you
know I did it myself
did you I&#39;m gonna go back to that
question in a minute but I&#39;m going to
talk to you about one other kind of
mentor and that&#39;s the Challenger we
don&#39;t like them no we&#39;d love to hate
them but they keep you real they keep
you grounded they make sure that you
understand that you owe it to yourself
to be the best that you can ever be they
are the ones who are out there saying
yes this person should sit in this seat
at this table because they have what it
takes they can help in this situation
because they have that background those
people that we talk about they&#39;re
they&#39;re the ones who are in the room
when the discussions come up about the
diversity candidate let me talk about
the diversity candidate for a second
that was me
very often she&#39;s female she&#39;s black
she&#39;s in science there&#39;s only one of her
then we need to interview her that&#39;s not
supposed to be the discussion the
discussion is supposed to be she trained
in Germany she knows her stuff she loves
the students
let&#39;s bring her in here and interview
her because she is going to contribute
if there is no champion at the table
that&#39;s not going to happen that&#39;s not
going to happen so now we need to talk
about why why do we need Mentors
and if you are actually someone who
identifies as a member of an
underrepresented group in your community
at your workplace at your place of
higher education at your school these
are the things you need to think about
why do you need these mentors conscious
bias exists there are people who don&#39;t
want women at the table there are people
who don&#39;t want brown folks at the table
there are people who don&#39;t want to see a
hijab at the table there are people who
don&#39;t want to see someone at the table
who identifies as transgender it&#39;s
conscious I got tired a while ago
hearing about implicit bias I got tired
because I felt like it was to get out of
jail free card
oh my biases are implicit they&#39;re
unconscious I&#39;m not thinking yes you are
sometimes you are let&#39;s be real a lot of
times you&#39;re not how people of goodwill
want to believe that they&#39;re not biased
but we know we do have to educate
ourselves we do have to acknowledge we
do have to be aware of unconscious
biases that&#39;s very true but we do have
to recognize that microaggressions
they hurt people we do have to recognize
that that pain that comes from being
constantly told that you&#39;re not supposed
to be at the table is painful what makes
a person who feels and sees that every
day
believe in humanity they believe in
humanity because of your compassion they
meet you and they recognize that you
listen with compassion you teach them
with compassion that is what keeps them
going and that is what keeps them out on
the road to success trying to be the
best that they can be now in the end we
have to remember one very important
thing it&#39;s up to us to find the people
that we need on our team we need
trainers who are going to be there to
hear us to love us to push us to want us
to be there but it&#39;s your choice you go
out you work hard don&#39;t have your
mentors working harder than you are you
make sure that they can be proud of you
because their investment is large so
what I want to leave with you today is
the one thing that you do not ever
forget the choices that you make are
important the mentors that you choose
are important the people are on your
team are important because you are the
master of your fate and you are the
captain of your soul thank you
you
