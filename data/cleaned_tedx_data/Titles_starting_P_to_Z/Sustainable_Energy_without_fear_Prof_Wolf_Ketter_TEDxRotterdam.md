what you see here are headlines I have
collected over the last three to four
years some of them go back on to 2013 14
15 and some of them are just very
reasoned from last week they in all in
one way or the other talking about
energy but in particularly one message
these headlines are transponding that is
fear one fear is the fear of climate
change the other fear is the fear about
reliable sustainable energy the first
fear is a real fear my son will be born
in about one month from now and I want
him to grow up in a world that is
sustainable and where we can lift from
the resources out of this earth and
don&#39;t ruin our planet there is something
called world overshoot day it&#39;s coming
every year closer and closer currently
at the beginning of August and that just
means that we reach using more resources
from the earth than the earth can
replenish into waste and we cannot
continue this is unsustainable but we
can do something about this right now
the second fear is not a real fear about
reliable sustainable energy they are
connected to climate change but that is
something we can do and act right now my
team of researchers and colleagues
around the world are working on this
challenge for a number of years now we
can reach reliable affordable and
sustainable energy to make this place
better for all of us just have a
to understand this better at the
evolution of the energy landscape of the
last 30 to 40 years
I picked as a starting point the year of
1980 and the reason for that is that
this was the first time we saw something
like what we would call the emotional
ization of energy what is the emotional
ization of energy at this time almost
every country had just a very few energy
providers and ever mainly coal and
nuclear and at that time people like
also this channel builders asked to
happen demonstrated against this nuclear
power on the street especially in
Germany and it was the birth hour of the
Green Party but the structure of these
companies there were a big conglomerate
us they were the same companies who were
generating electricity distributing and
then bringing it to the customer billing
the customer the customer says blue box
at the bottom
it&#39;s a quiet difference between those
and the Kaufman didn&#39;t call it the
customer they call it often the
connection point but it&#39;s not a very
nice thing to do very onion then in
about the 90s we saw something is
happening in that energy landscape by
regulation the companies were forced to
split off in providers and distributing
of the energy but on the earth
customer site not much change what
happened in the 90s we had further
differentiation in the energy industry
and then you don&#39;t see that slide I
wanted to see okay then I tell you just
what this light is about what you would
see over the last 10 years is the first
differentiation of the energy landscape
the energy companies differentiated
versa but what&#39;s more important really
something happened now on the customer
side now for the first time they can
also produce energy they can become a
producer of energy so not just consume
but also produce an
and that&#39;s what we call we are entering
the age of the prosumer and in 2011 when
the Fukushima disaster happened in Japan
then it was the second wave of the
emotional ization of energy when
millions people around the world that
specifically in Germany went onto the
streets and demonstrated against nuclear
power that was a turning point for the
German government and for the energy
industry and overall now for the first
time the same Conservative government in
Germany who just extended the running
times of nuclear power plants just three
months prior to that took off all 17
nuclear power plants in Germany after
three months we mainly retired eight in
the remaining 922 faced out now
some people see that as a threat they
see when we have sustainable energy it
will not be a la reliable energy why is
this because we need to provision energy
and then we usually need to burn
something like coal and that has a big
advantage
it delivers a constant output the good
thing about sustainable energy it&#39;s
pretty much for free the sun is shining
and the wind is blowing and then you
have that energy but a problem then is
these are weather dependent so we need
to provision energy upfront that we have
it available at this very moment that
the lights and the tool now on then we
have certain markets where we can buy
energy and some people offer their
energy so here you can see renewable
energy sustainable and she comes in
various for free almost afterwards
for example nuclear energy saying coal
energy and other forms of energy this is
just the market very provision energy
upfront ahead of time yes okay
all kinds of different energy at the
market we need to determine a price that
we are saying we are kind of assembling
this kind of energy that&#39;s the queen
line and then there&#39;s some demand
outside in a you know from the
population there should be some demand
there it is
and how can we determine a price we just
go towards the y axis and we have a
price
now comes the crooks my vision and the
vision of my team and many people around
the world want to have sustainable
energy and many politicians want to have
there too and we say hey we just
increased the amount of renewable energy
what happens if you do this remember the
renewable energy is the green energy you
see here now we increase the amount of
energy available on these markets and on
dates where the wind is blowing hard and
the sun is shining hard then we see a
it&#39;s dominating these markets are
dominated by sustainable energy and then
what we see is a wonderful - prices
lowering they think that is wonderful we
increase renewable energy the good
energy and we get it even at a cheaper
price the problem with energy is it&#39;s a
specific good at any moment in time
supply and demand has to be imbalance we
cannot limitless store energy so there
is a specific other market the market of
today where we make up the differences
that were because of more wind was
produced or energy wind or people just
used more energy let&#39;s say in the winter
so what happens generally if you look if
we increase the amount of renewable
energy prices go down on these markets
wonderful that sounds like a no-brainer
to me we can just say hey the increased
amount of renewable energy now what
happens if increase further the amount
of neural energy what you see on that
market
of today there&#39;s almost like a dance
happening that is because there is so
much energy generated by water wind Sun
and people using it in all the kinds of
way they want there&#39;s a lot of
chaoticness going on in this market and
as a consequence all these color of
fossil fuel producers which we wanted to
have out in the first place can provide
this energy because they are have
flexible resources they can just burn
something whenever they want to and as a
consequence but we should see it&#39;s like
this the prices are rising big lesson
learned here we should introduce
sustainable energy in a sustainable
manner now how can we get to a
sustainable reliable energy future that
is good for us all I envision this
future as a parcel of a 1 billion little
piece it&#39;s not like one big bang effect
politicians say yeah we will turn off
all these power plants and everything
will be great and we better just put
them wind turbines and everything is
hunky-dory it&#39;s not like this
but what are the pieces of the puzzle
microcut wouldn&#39;t it be great if he for
example share you have solar cells you
have electric vehicles in your area and
your tribe on vacation and then you can
sell your energy which is being produced
on your roof to your neighbor but hey
you on vacation you cannot so easily
sell it
ramping these are just flexible
resources we could use right now but we
have to monitor all these things all the
time
real-time markets could be just create
like the the mayor of Rotterdam said hey
we want to have a local energy market
just design it it&#39;s quite risky demands
of management that is something when we
if the new energy landscape works and we
have weather dependent sustainable
energy then we need to provide
information when energy is plentiful and
when we can use the energy this
information is usually done by a pricing
we call this dynamic pricing say hey
wouldn&#39;t it be great probably during the
night to win
turbines here Tomas flock the blowing
very hard you can just get up between
the morning charge your leg your vehicle
and save a cup of euro good idea right
to get up in the middle of the night
maybe not smart metering will facilitate
this change markets one of the things
which is crucial in this future energy
landscape is storage but storage is not
limitless available it&#39;s only you know
people think about electric vehicles as
the Rosetta Stone that is true electric
vehicles are important but we need all
kind of ways of storage currently there
is not enough energy storage available
in this world to make the sustainable
energy landscape possible so should we
now just give up
so my goodness there&#39;s a way to harder
for complexity well there is help in one
of the fundamental concepts in this
whole new energy landscape is something
what we call flexibility we all you have
to be more flexible about your energy
usage later meaning when you get home
later maybe not today but maybe in three
four or five years from now this you&#39;re
like a vehicle it might not be the best
idea to immediately plug in your
electric vehicles because if you enable
that neighbor neighbor your neighbors
doing it may be that the wires in the
grid are glowing at some point you will
see all this monitoring of information
coming towards you and that&#39;s way too
much we need help in that way a lot of
the speakers today talked about the IOT
talked about security issues and these
things and what my research crew vinayan
colleagues around the world have been
working on it&#39;s a platform and it&#39;s a
model that can help this and the piece
of intelligent software this green
margin looking guy this is the help we
need all of you in the future
we&#39;ll have the so-called intelligent
software agents
it&#39;s an highly intelligent piece of
software that learns your preferences
your goals and desires over time and
then can act on your behalf that means

you do not have to get up at 3:00 in the
morning and charge you&#39;re likely vigo
that agent will do that for you
you don&#39;t have to get back from your
vacation to sell your power to your
neighbor that agent will get back to you
power tech is also an international
competition of researchers dozens of
research groups around the world are
working together to make this
sustainable energy future a possibility
why is it so important that we test his
future markets because in this way we
can test it in a risk-free manner is a
large-scale simulation as an example how
markets can get really really wrong we
just have to look at the California
energy crisis of 2000 2001 there was a
flaw in a market design and people
misuse that they make the market
manipulation and netting decrease the
supply of energy and out of a sudden
between April 2000 and December of 2000
the holes and prices raised up by 800%
as a consequent PG&amp;E went bankrupt and
Edison Kazan almost went bankrupt in
that process there burned
forty to forty five billion dollars this
this power tech is a possibility we
might have avoided this problem because
many eyes around the world looking at
these kind of problems and working
together to make this energy future a
reality therefore I invite you to join
all of you in the future we&#39;ll have such
an intelligent agents it will take that
cognitive overload away from you you do
not have to be afraid of this agent it
is your helper it is
helping you and all the things you do
and because of all these people in this
community what I have seen over the last
decade on 20 years working on this
technology of all I am Not Afraid about
the future
I invite you and I&#39;m not afraid about
the future for my son no about you we
can all together tacular shadows of
renewable energy thank you
