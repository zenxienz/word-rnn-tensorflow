[Music]
so the word is in a race against time
that&#39;s what we&#39;re here this morning
that&#39;s what this image is actually
displaying and you may all recall that
ten years ago at the time the iPhone was
launched Al Gore in the inconvenient
truth essentially display an amazing
chart he was showing how from the end of
the Second World War the exponential
growth of the populations mixed together
the climate change could become the main
challenges of the Year actually of the
21st century
well truthful matters when I quit up or
five years ago
I joined an amazing University called
singularity they all talk about
transhumanism and one of the charts
which we took my attentions was this one
you see on that chart an amazing growth
accelerations exponential accelerations
of innovations of all technologies over
the last years you and I as a
generations were being able to have
access to the PC to the DNA discovery to
the internet and just essentially ten
years ago to the smartphone the
smartphone is really something which is
now entering in all of your life I&#39;m not
going to ask as you can did how many of
you do have an iPhone actually a
smartphone but I&#39;m sure many of you do
have this now that smartphone was
essentially reput to life on the 9th of
January 2007 by Steve Jobs with a
complete new design and what I want to
do today is essentially try to answers
about what if the smartphone the iPhone
would not be launched in 2007 if you
will not have been launched
essentially you will not have an amazing
device which bring three things in one
the Walkman of the 3rd 21st century the
iPod the
to listen to music an amazing new phone
and also an Internet communicator
three-in-one I repeat you get it as he
said essentially an iPod a phone and an
Internet communicator if that would not
come you may still be dealing with that
type of device which was at a time this
very cumbersome type of phone by which
the key innovations was to have a QWERTY
keyboards thanks God
smart phone came and changed everything
it changed first the way you and I we
interface with the machine the human
machine interface was reverse realized
once for all so much that while you were
used to write eventually they learn
about how to key at the time of the
computers now you basically unlock swipe
to zoom and essentially you use the
metaphor of the swiping on the place so
much that your kids your babies right
are able at the age of 2 or 3 or 4 to
consume to watch and sometimes he makes
you actually nervous in a complete
different way much earlier than you and
I the gray air were able to do so that
was the first revolutions but parallel
to that another amazing revolutions was
related to the apps the apps economy
remember upper was close to a near-death
experience because at the opposites of
Microsoft they didn&#39;t open the platform
in 1998 upper was essentially in faretta
bankrupt but learning from the lessons
the minute the iPhone came the idea was
to open that to any developers that was
a massive change because in Ferrara and
orange places you could now essentially
develop products the industry of the
apps today is bigger that the gaming
industry together with the boxing
industry box office industry the movies
the industries also been creating in
excess of 3.3 million jobs in coma here
I&#39;m sure you will find several hundreds
if not thousands of the
now the most points learnings is that a
third of your time is actually spent on
the apps at the cost of the TV the
newspaper the radio and even at the cost
of the web and the internet a third of
your time so much that just few years
back were magazines who actually put in
front cover the fact that the web is
dead maybe they were they are literally
but there is something definitely true
about it so true that the next key
feature which was essentially brought to
us by the iPhone was the concept of
always-on connectivity
instant on and always on what he means
he means that basically wherever you are
you can get access through
identification about breaking news
that&#39;s sometimes intrusive it&#39;s actually
difficult to leave but there&#39;s also
Beauty to it when you&#39;re able to have on
Facebook what is called the safety check
by which you are told that there is
nerve quake in century tree or when my
young child the royal charge which is in
New York tell me within few seconds
while there is a terrorist attack in New
York that is safe so there is a
beautiful stuff about the ability to
have these notifications but there is
also something fundamentally different
about the own warehouse they&#39;re always
on connectivity you can now be in the
bus on the boat on the lake in the train
and you can consume whatever you want a
video you can go on Netflix and watch a
movie you can add a minute get on the
internet and doom m-commerce by buying
merchandising so you went to interact
with the Machine you were to interact
with information and data has
dramatically changed so the what-if here
takes all of his full full meanings
announcement at least the always-on has
been also offering something very unique
a complete new economy the on demand
economy you can now be in the street and
air but
see uber of Rovia you can essentially
ask delivery at your place ordering good
pasta plate within a minutes going to be
into your place you can also ask all
array of new services which is
dramatically different and easier life
so you see from a piece of hardware with
a you unique human interface a full
array of services has been enabled but
that&#39;s not enough it&#39;s not only in the
area of economy that the smartphone has
been kind of impacting your life he also
changed in many respects our culture
does the earn famous selfie culture
something that many of you will hate
possibly but is a fact a fact of life
and why is that
because at summer of time we put a
camera in the front enabling a very cool
device called the FaceTime now better to
talk to my son Paul which is somewhere
in Europe I will be able to essentially
seem interact and the relationship I
will have with him will be in a
dramatically different one so I believe
this is one more time something extreme
positive so much positive that all the
political high cons and even the Pope
Francis cannot basically not access to
the selfie culture be part of it that&#39;s
the way the world is going and you have
today you need just to imagine what we
talk about here in just 10 years
you got in excess of 300 million people
on snapchat which are monthly user
monthly active users
you&#39;ve got 800 people which are
publishing every month in active manners
medias you&#39;ve got 1.3 billion people
which are using whatsapp and God knows
what&#39;s up is cool what&#39;s up allow you to
basically create groups interface
exchange create I have a complete even
way of looking at that scaring maybe but
that&#39;s the fact and we need to live with
it now once I said that once you
basically develop so much photos so much
videos so much media assets the question
of the privacy become extremely relevant
and that&#39;s where one not time deep core
technology has been brought to the
masses because that&#39;s really what the
people like the gatha&#39;s right the Google
Apple Amazon&#39;s Facebook Microsoft are
doing they bring technology to the
masses and here we use some of the
technology related to the biometrics the
fingerprint scanner which were just 10
years ago something exclusively relating
to possibly military matters or high
security ones become part of your daily
life by the launch of the touch ID doing
so the touch ID also is becoming part of
your day to day life how is that
happening because the bank have been
seeing aside of the classical ping codes
a new way to secure transactions up to
144 million people are using every day
today the touch ID as a way to interact
and transact but guess what the touch ID
is already obsolete just been launched
few years back and now what you are
going to have in the iPhone 10 in a
matter of few days since has been
launched is the facial recognition the
way we&#39;re going to basically relate to
security is not anymore we&#39;ve basically
a fingerprint but essentially the
ability to digitalize pixelize your face
and ensure that no one is a similar to
the other one one more time scaring but
that&#39;s what is happening and this
technology adjust to start of another
revolutions which is coming around it
which you heard about this morning which
is the artificial intelligence an
amazing revolution because once more
talking of the acceleration of the time
talking about the exponential growth all
of what is now embedded into your
smartphone was essentially totally
reserved to a handful number of people
just a few years few months few days ago
on artificial intelligence for example
you will be having anytime soon in your
home in the comfort of your home
a virus istant you might have heard of
the name of the Amazon Alexa soon the
upper theory using the applet pod the
Google now the Microsoft Cortana Samsung
S voice essentially a way to relate not
anymore by writing not anymore by King
not anymore by swiping on the screen by
by just talking taking basically the
full leverage of our five senses that&#39;s
really the corner of the street and is
going to invade your life not only the
voice assistants are here but in a
matter of a few more days
mom&#39;s you will also have the computer
vision the autonomous car technology
which is not yet totally here but which
is going to become part of our life in
the next five to ten years is going to
invade our day-to-day life this is
coming from the autonomous car research
but also coming from the military
research which I know it being brought
to the vast public and to the masses so
you see amazing technology related to
artificial intelligence but in fact and
I&#39;m not a specialist this is only the
tip of the iceberg
all new language logos will become very
familiar to your day-to-day life by
using word like natural language
processing speech to speech translations
I will simply basically spell a word and
I will get it automatically translated
in the language of choice machine
learning cybersecurity so an amazing
acceleration of time at technology which
is going to invade your life on a
day-to-day basis
but there is also kind of a human touch
to the smartphone which really relates
to the personal care he allows you to
basically better interact with your
peers allows you to transact to develop
m-commerce
to be in communications but now is going
to be also somewhat some more quite
intrusive in the way that by sensors
detector or around places is going to
tell you about how you need on how
you&#39;re doing from a health point of view
you&#39;ve got typically the ability to be
active they&#39;re going to challenge
you to move you may not realize here in
Italy or in Europe but some continent
and dealing with obesity as a massive
massive health policy issues this is
going to be partially addressing the
issue and another good one is a very
simple example which illustrate the
point about the appointee ahead of us
with a smartphone Renata essentially was
having a watch that was essentially told
him that his heart was going up in a
very unknown way he rushed to the
hospital it was detected a pulmonary
embolism we did not have gone to the
hospital it would have been a dead
person&#39;s today so you see that from this
kind of ugly physical Hardware being
this piece of smartphone there is also a
very human touch that we can see and a
whole range of new potentials to go
after so as the first conclusions from
what seems to be just a new iPod what
man of the 21st century a new mobile
phone an Internet communicator in fact
six seven eight and maybe I could name
much more a new technology came in and
that&#39;s really what is the ten years
looking back at the iPhone the amazing
ability to bring the core technology to
the old world and this would not have
been possible yesterday when you want it
to basically participate belongs to the
Pope Francis nominations you have a
handful number only of people on the
Peters Plaza today by having this iPhone
smartphone or this iPod you can relay
that to the world and make it and
sharing with anyone else but maybe what
I can announce today already
I&#39;m sorry wrong is that the iPhone is
dead that&#39;s not a true recover but a
sense already that soon you and I or
maybe 10 years from now that will be the
cover that yours here on the places why
is that because the concentrations of
power
of intelligence of sensor that you got
in knife on maybe tomorrow
just come into a pair of glasses or
better in contact lenses what if
tomorrow all of this smartphone features
would be essentially only being wear
into your eyes and be able to relate
through this voice assistance better
than that what if tomorrow your human
body will encompass include some of
these devices right and actually really
be part of something which is particular
making you human body full of technology
I know you are scaring now and scare and
you&#39;re right
because if the challenge of the world is
this exponential growth of technology
the common change there is may be
another challenge which that we need to
all remains human and that&#39;s the third
core challenge of this world and why is
that important because me the son of a
lagaye of ronaldo candy which was born
here hundred years ago I want to make
sure that we always use we fought the
iPhone my five centons to essentially
enjoy the beautiful Lake Como thank you
[Applause]
