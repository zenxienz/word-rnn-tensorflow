so quitters never win and winners never
quit right that&#39;s what we&#39;re told as
kids that&#39;s what we get drilled into us
that if you quit you failed and if you
failed you are a failure it&#39;s quite
defining but I want you to consider an
alternative what if instead of dropping
out or giving up quitting was the only
way to win or at least the better way to
win I&#39;m jasmine and quitting saved my
career have a think about the last time
that someone you respect recommended a
book or a film to you but you didn&#39;t
think you were gonna like it
so they come at you and they say look
you&#39;re gonna love it it&#39;s amazing
everyone loves it this film it&#39;s my
favorite please will you watch it you
thinking this isn&#39;t really me but you
know what I respect you everyone says
it&#39;s great I&#39;m gonna watch it I&#39;m gonna
read it you get started you&#39;re a few
pages a few minutes in you&#39;re not
feeling it but could be a slow starter
so you carry on halfway through you do
not like this you&#39;re certain so what do
you do do you put the book down you turn
the film off or do you keep going you
know one voice in your head saying am I
the weird one is something wrong with me
if I don&#39;t like this everyone else likes
it it&#39;s got great reviews
what&#39;s the problem with me but end of
the day whatever you choose it&#39;s a book
it&#39;s a film that&#39;s time you can afford
to waste I was in danger of that being
my whole life
he needs some context I&#39;m a long jumper
I&#39;ve been competing internationally
since I was 14 years old and the plan
when I went to uni was always to join a
group that had a world-class coach that
had an Olympic champion in the group and
several other international athletes I&#39;d
have world-class facilities it was
everything I needed
I was so
right it&#39;s ago when I got there I got
stronger
I got faster I got fitter I got more
powerful I was in peak physical
condition but the results didn&#39;t come in
fact I started to go backwards I went
from being the second best jr. in the
world the year before to not even making
the UK junior team I was devastated
I couldn&#39;t figure out I had everything
that I supposedly needed right there
this was everything that I had worked
for and it wasn&#39;t working for me
I can understand and so I was torn I
didn&#39;t know what to do one part we
wanted to leave try something else but
another part was thinking you push
through no matter what this is supposed
to be hard but I just couldn&#39;t shake it
something wasn&#39;t right I was unhappy and
it showed in my performance so I bit the
bullet and I left I dropped out of uni I
left my coach in the middle of the
season which was risky but I was unhappy
to the point where I figured out that
without happiness the success wasn&#39;t
coming and I was miserable I was ready
to drop outs ball together so instead I
went back to where I trained when I was
at school I went back to my school coach
I think this was the first time that I&#39;d
really stopped and instead of just
listening to what everyone says this is
how you achieve success this is how you
are happy this is exactly what you need
I stopped and thought what do I need and
the answer was something different it
wasn&#39;t the same as what everyone had
been telling me and that had surprised
me you see I was so ready to retire from
sport at 19 years old and I think if I
hadn&#39;t managed to find a way to reframe
quitting to say to myself okay it&#39;s
quitting losing because that&#39;s how I&#39;d
always seen it and I hate losing I&#39;m a
terrible loser so bad at losing and so
when I bundled those two things together
I&#39;ve got quitting and losing this is
something I did
want to associate myself with but it
came to a point where I went this has to
be the best thing for your career and so
before I quit at 19 I was ready to drop
out instead between the ages of 19 and
22 I won five international medals two
national titles finished my law degree I
made the Olympic final sorry oh thanks
I was about to say you know sorry I
couldn&#39;t finish that with I won the
Olympics the story is not that good but
luckily I&#39;m not talking to you from the
end of a success story
I&#39;m speaking to you from smack bang in
the middle of it and quitting meant that
I now have the chance to win in the
future because if I&#39;d stayed put I
wouldn&#39;t be standing here talking to you
I&#39;d be at home on the phone to my mum
saying
who&#39;d you remember when I was younger
and I could have been good enough to go
to the Olympics so it was everything
that I needed and I found that one side
reframe my mindset like this I started
to notice people people that I admired
had done the same thing one of my
favorite authors Gretchen Rubin she&#39;s
written so many books she&#39;s an expert on
happiness and habits and she runs a
successful blog podcast and app and
she&#39;s only able to be and do all these
things because she quit she quit a
prestigious career in law to take on
writing because she knew that law wasn&#39;t
right for her and if she quit now she&#39;s
a New York Times bestselling author she
looks like she&#39;s winning to me so we
live in an environment that a lot of
things are temporary
were able to change so much and that can
be a great thing but it doesn&#39;t mean the
fundamental rules have changed long-term
commitment to one thing is still the way
to get success but we have the
opportunity to try and try and try until
we find that one thing that&#39;s the right
thing for us so if you need to I
encourage you to quit with purpose
whether that&#39;s making yourself happier
making room for something or someone
in your life or doing a full 180 and
pursuing something totally different
know why you&#39;re quitting and head off in
the direction of winning so winners
never quit and quitters never win right
well not exactly
thank you
