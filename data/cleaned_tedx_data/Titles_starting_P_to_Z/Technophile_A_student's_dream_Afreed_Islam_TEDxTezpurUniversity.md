so the team today is dreams and in
context to my talk today are like this
it translates respect to change ambition
or aspiration I suppose so
this takes me back to today those who
visited releasing two companies the Dark
Knight here&#39;s another for model yes I am
and the first if you love Ironman I was
really impressed by the high tech
computer stood hiya Tony Stark with some
main character of the movie used right
and reduced the scientific like how the
futuristic science was invaded to
portray the story to make it appreciable
even by the more common sense right so
do you wish we should be using system so
this is where it gets very interesting
that time I that technologically update
like recently polls and I am going to
have to build a system like that but I
help child that time I mean
you listening to the front of my friends
here&#39;s a crazy guy with a little mention
that when I have reduced circle of
friends son that type that period of
time I have I wish my dream one minute
they&#39;re on the main three I&#39;m not
talking about like Steve in the
competition but yes this nature the
spoon I will mention I would like to say
that the system how did you have a
system like Iron Man job but that time
my friends make fun of me like they
thought to be impractical like we must
manage to wear movie that we want to be
Superman that one is like everyone&#39;s
dream when we were killed we multiply we
jump the beds in our other than the
deaths teaching us to be super nice
right everybody
yeah I do think that later I had
sleepless nights cs50 sleepless nights
because I had enough that they become a
new system like that so I have like it
was having that attack of my studies -
because I was - was associated with
discovering new things
inventing new staffs and you know like
we are we
Society will like we don&#39;t move in our
dreams we we are forced to fulfill the
dream of our parents
everyone needs a engineering or dr. levy
but that one sometime I I myself face
those issues because my parents also one
thing as my class ten went came to
examination was approaching I was this
is totally bothersome using computers
imagine the situation when you were
about me with something and you have got
the music computer internet that is a
nightmare
so what did he was I like two masters I
went to my friends house he writes you
husband is like every day his Redeemer I
will this house one night I tell parents
that I will study with me
like in the confessional where I like to
provide in the service so but he had a
good message that wasn&#39;t greater for me
you see let me walk away from you
for these excessive insulin is only I
would believe that I could build a
system like that he&#39;s not 100 it&#39;ll all
our friends hockey crazy
before that I am even if I&#39;m a kid I
wanted to God not movie star so many
positive constraint examination when I
was I didn&#39;t stop watching trendy
speaking English stop working
one journalist be here with me he was
you not feel now I give you five carbon
emissions
I like I&#39;m a system which you might like
your might be aware of but you can
google it it&#39;s not available
that&#39;s a system that doesn&#39;t use a heart
aches or an SSD if you know microchipped
electronic program of microchip which
works as a public itself so I would like
you bring it here for now because really
I will make this time and that was quite
a fabulous job there so let me speak
about Donna Hartman&#39;s sister holding the
letter I trusted when I like Isis
forwards my CCP was 8.6 so it was hard
for me to get into it&#39;s good food but
like the most open data and like all my
friends out there have scored 10 points
so that might mean even they would have
the best chance for me like all the
genius transitions of books no one has
time we will talk to each other and tell
me like the most reactions freedom from
one understands my games computers or
stuff that whether they are being
prepared to pretty good choice literally
like there are ways to die
I study I spend it happy a big
recognition on Pete
so I started I have to pass for Moscow

at 6:00 6:00 a.m. from happy now
so now again America welcome miss my
exam I started the consider and then
waited hours I was experimenting with
some prototypes for this death finding
the dream that have been like at the
time dreaming about the dream and the
dream enough of the LIA computer system

they find it and exactly 4:15 a.m. as I
never liked acquaintances I was able to
produce a transparent holographic
projection so that night I can tell if
my brother&#39;s my friends because they
this kind of study we see
a system and within that dream is quite
challenge but once your dream comes
becomes true like for me that was what
anything in the world
yeah well then everyone has an earache a
moment but they are that particular
moment for me was the best moment that
once that engineering the jobs that
money can give me I was satisfied I was
enjoying and my friends would not get me
when I told them the RAM
like that my friends you can see this is
true this is true I fulfill my dream but
you&#39;re not enough to someone else&#39;s
dream that I come up with a name still
this is the main force against me you X
which is in mathematics has access
modified with final equation almost with
an asked so does that Jesus doesn&#39;t
undermine displayed
yes something like that
the system another website by the name
of it is only like you Sunday Rahman and
I will be
[Music]
yes right now
because it&#39;s a big day for me to go for
next business before engineering so for
in fact
yes this is where you see for five
minutes and note down all that you read
about that we will be dreaming about
since your childhood like fulfillment
like
did you feel your thing this is a little
bit that&#39;s efficient trying to get out
which are dreams that are left to be
within reach our dreams sorry for
there&#39;s a bigger question I think this
already with engines
[Applause]
