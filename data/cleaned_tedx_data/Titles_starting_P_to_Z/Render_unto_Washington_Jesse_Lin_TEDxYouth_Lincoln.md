going up in Lincoln
I was raised Chinese Christian that
means I attended the Chinese Christian
Church which is pretty normal we had
church every Sunday but in this quaint
little side auditorium branched off from
a full-fledged Church here in Lincoln
the entrance actually was set off by
this rusty fire escape because was the
main entrance to the building and so
every Sunday we&#39;d have to pass under
that to go to service and it got to the
point where when I was younger I thought
church was something that was really
sketchy and sort of not normal but
really it was just mine that was a
little odd here is a picture of me with
Santa Claus who I thought was a God when
I was younger then I learned about that
story in Exodus where God tells Moses no
one sees the face of God and lives and
that wasn&#39;t really the Christmas miracle
I was looking forward to that year but
anyway a more interesting result of my
unconventional upbringing in the
Christian faith is that I was absolutely
ignorant of some of the etiquette namely
that there is this sort of gag order on
religion for example at a dinner with
friends you always have to keep the
conversation away from the so called
controversies which inevitably means
religious opinions now first I thought
this was just my anecdotal experience
but as it turns out it&#39;s systemic
about 49% of Americans rarely if ever
discuss religion with people outside
their family and later I learned the
other half of this because this doesn&#39;t
affect just religion rather we proper
Americans can&#39;t talk about two things to
polite company that&#39;s religion and
politics now first I didn&#39;t get it
especially the religion part now sure no
two people will share the same
perspective on religious issues and
that&#39;s partially why it&#39;s such a taboo
subject and so I had to grow to accept
this explanation but it&#39;s really not the
whole story because Christianity is
important to American politics in unique
ways it&#39;s enshrined in our money in the
Declaration of Independence and the
original pilgrim communities that found
in our society in other words
American politics is rooted in
Christianity and curiously nowadays
there&#39;s been a huge backlash to that a
barn our group survey found that from
1996 to 2004 the percentage of
non-christians who had a quote/unquote
bad impression of Christianity nearly
doubled and the surveyors also found
some of the problem around three out of
four of all surveyed called Christianity
too involved in politics and nearly nine
out of ten called Christianity
hypocritical or judgmental clearly least
historic ties between Christianity and
American politics have had a rather
negative effect on its public image in
the modern day but now I don&#39;t think
it&#39;s right to just blame Americans being
ideologically opposed to Christian
politics because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s
necessarily true but rather Christianity
also has this internal image problem
simply put when it comes to our beliefs
we believers don&#39;t know how to express
them and so often we just won&#39;t and
those who do speak out and bring up
religion only do so in relation to
political issues now of course in many
ways politics and religion are similar
they&#39;re both places where people find
their values their sense of right and
wrong and they&#39;re both communities for
something bigger than ourselves as
individuals and so it&#39;s understandable
that their goals overlap sometimes but
the mistake comes when we treat them the
same way because they&#39;re still not the
same thing and so we often treat them
the same way not people will go to us
into these two long political type
arguments I saw a study recently that
sums this up nicely now this is satire
to the best of my knowledge but it makes
an apt point which is that political
discourse has a very particular tone to
it away framing discussions that may be
appropriate for the elections but
clearly not through everything so we
should aim to change the terms of this
discussion to change the forum in which
we conduct it which doesn&#39;t necessarily
require changing its content now why do
I say that because
there are certain political facts about
Christianity in the United States that
we cannot change overnight
for example that evangelicals generally
vote in certain ways on certain issues
and that has been the huge sticking
point for a lot of people but these are
all issues of content their doctrinal
issues that pastors have debated and
will continue to do so but what all of
us here today us common people or us non
pastors at least what we all can do is
change the way we think about and the
way we hold these everyday conversations
about religion if we do at all and if we
can divest ourselves from the political
model of conflict we can open up these
discussions to a diversity of viewpoints
and then to a genuine understanding and
connection between people because well
politics almost by its nature is
irreconcilable one side will win when it
counts religion is not that same sort of
ballgame and it doesn&#39;t do us any good
to treat them the same way what I
imagine is a future in which we can
freely open these discussions about
faith about ethics and about community
because whether we&#39;re religious or
non-religious whichever religion were
part of we all have a stake in these
issues and these topics all matter and
they matter so much that we cannot
afford to play it like the pundits now
of course when you go to open these
discussions you&#39;ll never meet with
perfect agreement and that&#39;s just how it
is but only through trying this more
open form of communication can we
actually gain something to improve our
communities and improve ourselves as
individuals and I think we should give
that a chance but we won&#39;t gain anything
if we always set out with this singular
goal to convert which is almost like an
expectation nowadays now I don&#39;t mean to
say that you need to compromise on your
beliefs and I don&#39;t mean to say that you
need to agree to disagree but rather our
beliefs are inevitably colored by
encountering other people&#39;s opinions by
building relationships with them and by
maneuvering in these relationships so in
other words these conversations they&#39;re
valuable in and of themselves and really
it&#39;s on us for intentionally falling
into these patterns of device
that have been so counterproductive and
so detrimental to Christianity and to
the public image of organized religion
as a whole in this country just talk for
talks sake then maybe it can be powerful
i opening and maybe even fun so i
challenge all of you to raise the
religion subject to a friend and break
that silence and i know it can be done
because i used to do it all the time
when i was younger and i didn&#39;t know any
better and i know it can be done because
i&#39;ve done it right here politics and
religion are these two secret topics
that we have to avoid at the dinner
table but let&#39;s de couple those two and
let&#39;s deal with them differently because
they are different and we have the power
to change the way we hold these
discussions and the way we consider
these issues so let&#39;s leave the news
media to deal with vicious political
conflicts and as for the rest of us
let&#39;s proclaim the good news
