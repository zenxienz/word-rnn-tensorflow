twelve years ago on a hot sticky August
night I began to learn the difference
between duty and inspiration and it
taught me a lot about what we need to do
today I was mayor of Minneapolis back
then on that day in August when the
i-35w bridge collapsed and on that day
thirteen people died and hundreds were
injured and yet it would have been a lot
worse if not for the incredible heroism
that we saw for Minnesotans they dove
into the water to save people from
drowning they walked out into the bridge
and risk their own live because there
were school kids on a bus that was
precariously perched on the edge of that
bridge I will never forget the looks in
the eyes of the family that expected
their mom and their wife home for dinner
now coming to terms with the fact that
she was dead
and yet somehow they set that aside and
turn to the table next to them and
helped a man who was coming to terms
with his own brother who was dead
Minnesotans did not run from danger
Minnesotans ran to help because it was
their duty it was an incredible thing
that happened but then we set out to do
something that was an even bolder vision
we decided that we would build a bridge
in one year&#39;s time that may not sound
like a lot but anybody who knows
anything about it knows it would take at
a minimum three years if you could
possibly get everyone working together
but we did that we got all those
overlapping bureaucracies the scores of
people who have something to say about
the Mississippi River the architects the
engineers the community groups and get
this
we got Republicans and Democrats
including the governor and including me
to somehow find a way to be on the same
side and we we we built that bridge in
one year&#39;s time it taught me that it was
important that it was our duty but more
that we had a vision an inspiring vision
where we looked up and saw a vision
together that said we could somehow
create common ground when a calm
ground head shook and I don&#39;t tell you
now because I want to relive the trauma
of that day no one does but I tell you
because of the lesson I learned that
Duty is important but inspiration is
even more powerful and it&#39;s more
powerful when you apply it to the two
biggest issues that we face in this
community today the first of those is
the unacceptable achievement gap in our
schools that shows that the outcomes for
kids in our schools are dramatically
different along racial lines and the
second issue is the fact that we face a
looming worker shortage that threatens
to grind our economy to a halt now I
believe it is absolutely our duty to
make sure that this community is no
longer a place where you can predict the
likelihood of a child&#39;s success by
looking at the color of their skin and I
believe it is also our duty to ensure
that we&#39;re not mortgaging our kids
future because we didn&#39;t do what we had
to do to plan an economy for the future
that is our duty but the powerful point
is that behind both of those issues
the further you dig the more you realize
they&#39;re the same issue and there&#39;s an
inspirational vision that can help us
solve them both and here&#39;s what I mean
the worker shortage that we have is 100%
about race now back in the 1990&#39;s we
were producing about 54,000 new workers
a day as the baby boom was just coming
into the middle of the workforce by the
2000s we were down to 34,000 a year
between 2015 and 2025 we will be
producing only 6,000 workers a year now
let&#39;s bring race into that equation if
you didn&#39;t include people of color in
that we would already be at negative
growth 100% of the employment growth
that we will have is people of color
which also means that the very people we
are depending on to make this economy go
are also the very people who are being
failed by our schools it is 100% about
trying to solve the issues together so
you ask yourself if this is the biggest
issue we face why aren&#39;t we talking
about this every single day why aren&#39;t
we putting the money toward it that we
need to and probably even more important
why are we not willing to disrupt the
systems that are failing too many of our
kids well this isn&#39;t a new issue to me
I&#39;ve spent a lot of time on this as a
mayor now is at the Minneapolis
Foundation and especially in between
those two jobs when I led Generation
Next which was a coalition of
public/private partners in this
community focused especially on closing
this achievement gap and I can tell you
from that that there are so many people
doing incredible work out there with
their hearts but I did come to a
conclusion that was pretty unsettling I
recognized that one of the reasons why
we&#39;re not doing all that we need to
every day every one of us is because I
honestly don&#39;t believe we believe we can
solve this problem I believe we need to
manage it but people don&#39;t see that we
can actually win and I believe the
reason for that is because people keep
looking for that one thing that&#39;s going
to solve this problem I can&#39;t tell you
how many times people said to me give me
the one thing it&#39;ll take to close the
achievement gap well right now I could
give you the one thing it&#39;ll take to
close the achievement gap as soon as one
of you can give me the one ingredient it
takes to bake a cake the fact of the
matter is there is no one big thing it&#39;s
a recipe for success and the good news
is the ingredients are starting to be in
place a lot is working the first
ingredient is to start early now I love
being in a state like Minnesota where
the largest political debate is not
about whether we should invest in early
childhood but about whether we should
invest millions in all-day kindergarten
or millions in targeted preschool
scholarships for kids most
need you know what&#39;s great the answer is
they&#39;re both right you know what&#39;s even
better this state has invested millions
more in both of them and we&#39;re moving to
improve the quality of every kid because
we recognize you start early and that&#39;s
why it&#39;s also so great they have the
Northside achievement Zone in
Minneapolis and st. Paul&#39;s Promise
Neighborhood two of the best examples in
this country of what we learn at the
Harlem Children&#39;s Zone which said draw a
circle around the parts of your
community that have the greatest needs
surround those parents right when the
kids are born with the supports they
need and carry that right into school we
are succeeding because we start early we
also have to recognize we can&#39;t let
anyone slip through the cracks not only
is it wrong but we can&#39;t afford to waste
anybody so let me tell you some
interesting research these brilliant
researchers at the University of Chicago
said why are so many kids not graduating
especially why are so many kids not
graduating and they looked at a lot of
factors there&#39;s a lot of factors in in
school out of school with it with
individual kids about pregnancy about
racism about mobility all sorts of
factors but you know what they found out
the single most important factor for a
kidnapper age of graduating from high
school is gonna get a drumroll please
they don&#39;t have enough credits now that
didn&#39;t take a rocket science to figure
that out right okay but then these
brilliant people asked the next question
how do we count credits and they
recognized the schools really don&#39;t have
a great system for that certainly the
kids don&#39;t and certainly the parents
don&#39;t and certainly the out of school
people don&#39;t and what they did at
Chicago we&#39;re now doing here it&#39;s called
on track and it sets up the technology
and the partnership so we&#39;re not waiting
to that kid wanders into the counselor&#39;s
office a few hours before a graduation
and said I didn&#39;t pass the math class in
freshman year we say back when you don&#39;t
pass the English test in ninth grade an
alert goes off in school out of school
parents teachers everyone knows and we
get that kid
back on track we cannot let a single kid
slip through the cracks and the next
thing we have to do is to make sure we
create pathways for success now as
adults we recognize it&#39;s hard enough for
us to figure out how to plan our career
it&#39;s tougher as an adolescent and it&#39;s
even tougher for them to figure out how
to get the work experience they need to
be able to build a resume and get that
first step on the ladder that&#39;s why in
2003 we developed step up it&#39;s a summer
job program we have the graduation just
yesterday and as of yesterday over these
years we have now put 28 thousand young
people into high-quality jobs in almost
every great organization in this
community and you know what&#39;s even
better ninety percent of those are kids
below the poverty line eighty percent
are kids of color fifty percent our kids
from first or second generation
immigrant families we are creating
pathways that kids can understand and
they are succeeding and we also have to
never give up never give up on any kid
and that&#39;s why I love some of the
contract alternative schools in
Minneapolis that&#39;s why one of them from
a Christian youth center they&#39;ve every
graduation they prove a pretty simple
thing that is so profound they show that
a kid who&#39;s not succeeding in a
traditional school environment may just
need another environment that&#39;s why I
love project for pride livings new
program that helps kids coming out of
the criminal justice system get back
into the school and graduate never give
up on anyone now the last point is
probably the most important people are
not problems to solve to address this I
want to make our problem that we&#39;re
looking at a little bit harder here we
not only need numbers of workers we need
a different kind of worker and the
different kind of worker that we need is
the kind that we can send in to Best Buy
or Target and immediately understand how
to relate to their rapidly diversifying
customer base we need the new kind of
worker who some of our global companies
3m carb
medtronic Neiman who can they send
around the world into places where
they&#39;re not thrown off by the fact that
they&#39;re not part of the majority culture
now we&#39;re in world would we find kids
like that well we happen to live in
Minnesota which has lived the values of
the Statue of Liberty better than almost
any community in the country wave after
wave a great emigration has come here
from Southeast Asia from Africa from
Central America we have done it the
right way and by doing that we have a
workforce that is a global goldmine
language skills cultural skills right
here and it&#39;s not just people who&#39;ve
arrived recently in a generation or two
stop and think about the
african-american boy in North
Minneapolis who goes from his
neighborhood across town to a school in
a radically different neighborhood who
goes downtown to there step-up job and
back home that kid can teach us how to
code shift and this isn&#39;t just about
those kids look at me I&#39;m a 61 and a
half year old white guy who&#39;s lived
almost his entire life in a place where
I&#39;m part of the majority culture unless
people like me get a radical infusion of
global fluency we will become dinosaurs
now I went to Japan for the first time
and when I went to Japan I read my world
my wife this really strange email I said
you know I&#39;ve been with people all week
but I&#39;ve never felt so lonely and I
couldn&#39;t figure out what the deal was
until after a while I unpacked it and I
recognized that I had never done
business I had never been in a situation
where I needed to be recognized as peers
with people across the table in a place
where I wasn&#39;t part of the majority
culture who could teach me to do that
the kid who came from a refugee camp in
Kenya that kid crossing town from place
to place from culture to culture that is
the most important piece that
we have now I want to finish this by
telling you a little story about
somebody teaching math in Los Angeles
okay so she&#39;s teaching math and she&#39;s
trying to teach kids negative numbers
now think about this as a teacher here&#39;s
one here&#39;s two here&#39;s zero how do you
explain negative numbers right well they
couldn&#39;t get it in Los Angeles so she
did what every smart person does she
moves back to Minnesota and she&#39;s here
in Minnesota and she&#39;s she&#39;s teaching
these kids negative numbers and all of a
sudden they&#39;re getting it just like that
now why would a kid in Minnesota
understand negative numbers
January the moment they hear below zero
they get negative numbers okay so stop
and think about this a unique population
in a unique experience learn something
we can all share those kids in Minnesota
can teach those kids negative numbers or
bring them to be here in January they&#39;ll
get it the fact of the matter is what we
have is the ability to have a new
generation whose experiences make us all
better be on duty the cleanest thing
that anyone can teach you in any math
problem is one plus one equals three and
the most important thing that we know is
the most powerful simple message we make
each other better thank you
