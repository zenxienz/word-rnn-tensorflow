once when I was younger I was looking up
pictures of the ocean to put his
background for my Kindle then I came
across these these pictures really
scared me I didn&#39;t know that this
happened I thought people respected the
beaches and oceans but apparently they
didn&#39;t I did some more research and
found that by 2050 there will be more
plastic in the oceans and fish by weight
in just two minutes over 32,000 fill
grams of plastic enter the ocean crazy
right the reasons garbage and litter
when you throw something in the trash it
gets picked up by a garbage company
right well some places in the world keep
their trash in landfills and others dump
it all in the ocean when you litter you
don&#39;t throw your trash in the can it
ends up on the ground and if not eaten
by animals the trash usually get into
the storm drain we all know where storm
drains go to the ocean what&#39;s bad about
plastic in the ocean you ask everything
plastic could and usually does get
mistaken for food by fish so they eat it
but plastic attracts toxins so if a fish
eats a piece of plastic that&#39;s been
sitting in the ocean for a while it
probably already would have attracted
toxins dumped into the ocean such as
sunscreen pesticides and everything in
between
this is what happens when a sea creature
collides with a piece of plastic
if plastic stays in the ocean for too
long breaks down into what is called
micro plastic thing with micro plastic
is that it&#39;s one millionth of a meter
which means it could pass through a
fish&#39;s body tissue so even if the fish
doesn&#39;t eat it it could still get into
its body think about the implications of
that and people need fish to imagine
going to a fresh seafood place and
eating a toxic fish this needs to stop
need to do something about it and
plastic doesn&#39;t biodegrade biota Gration
is when something fades away into
nothingness trash biodegrades that&#39;s why
we keep it in landfills it&#39;ll just fade
away over time but plastic is different
plastic will stay forever I&#39;ve chosen to
take an engineering approach to this
problem I&#39;ve built a prototype of the
machine I&#39;m going to engineer in the
future it&#39;s a siphon hose inside a
container with a handle siphon just
means it can suck up liquids if you were
wondering the sucking in was sucked in
oil in plastic well the other end was
spewing to whatever container you want
the part that will attract the oil in
plastic is a chemical or compound I have
not yet invented this chemical will be
able to attract oil being able to
attract oil means that it will attract
plastic - this works because plastic is
an oil-based product which means it&#39;s
made from oil
so it&#39;ll attract boat this is it we
finished this will be something that can
be used at the shores or in the middle
of the ocean it will be given people who
live near the beaches and people who
just want to help this is something I&#39;m
working hard to do and I even have a
GoFundMe campaign if you don&#39;t know what
GoFundMe is
it&#39;s a site where you could raise money
for a certain cause just search up
GoFundMe on Google and then within the
site search up no trash ocean group and
yes I am part of a group want to help me
get started you can start by recycling
