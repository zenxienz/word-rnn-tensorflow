fashion is innovation it&#39;s the cutting
edge of how we look how we think and how
we feel
flashback 1700s a growing middle class
wants intricate embroidery and patterned
fabrics inspired by player pianos
inventors create a loom that takes
instructions from the mechanical drum
boom the speed reached and accessibility
of designers revolutionized chemistry
electricity and steam condom new
material that Eliza stretchier and more
suffer than ever
woman&#39;s work is redefined and with it
society&#39;s perception of their bodies
watch out here comes warts wear
swimsuits celebrating action physicality
and leisure politics protests and
rock-and-roll givers miniskirts
bell-bottoms gender nonconformity and
flower power a new era on Wall Street
sees men and women compete in power
suits the Dress for Success uniform
yields to more and more casual daytime
looks that expresses and enables
creativity technology begins to play a
bigger and bigger role in our daily
lives
phones become fashion computers become
clothes click style goes global social
fast fashion brings the catwalk to the
streets like this fashion is about more
than keeping up it&#39;s about designing the
future we want to live in will be demand
sustainable materials that safeguard our
environment will we grow our clothes in
bats or print them in our homes and when
we&#39;re able to use 3d digital desire to
create clothing all those custom threads
eliminate manufacturing waste
a R and D are transformed shopping
turning our living rooms into showrooms
dressing rooms and even catwalk or will
technology transform the in-store
experience into something entirely new
innovation isn&#39;t a fad it&#39;s fuel for
fashion express is not only who we are
but who we want to become
