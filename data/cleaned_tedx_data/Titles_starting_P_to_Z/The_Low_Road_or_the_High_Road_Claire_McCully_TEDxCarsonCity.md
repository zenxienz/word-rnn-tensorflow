do I belong in hell am i traveling down
the low road we&#39;re going up the high
road in 1986 when I was 12 years old I
had the opportunity to contemplate this
question after watching an episode of
The Twilight Zone it was a story titled
dead run and it was about a truck driver
who drove drove the souls of the dead to
hell and the imagery of that show that
still haunts me when I look back I
realized that the imagery mirrored the
imagery during the Holocaust and those
pictures where they basically shoved
people into the boxcars to send them off
to the concentration camps in this case
they were shoving these Souls into the
back of cattle trucks so the driver at
some point he realizes that hell is
really overcrowded and he&#39;s just
wondering like why are there&#39;s so many
people going down here so he decides to
interview the people in the back of his
truck and when he goes back to ask them
what their crimes against God are some
of them admit to their evil ways but at
least four of them are very bewildered
about why they were there one of them is
this elderly lady who confesses that she
was a public librarian who protected
some controversial books on her shelves
another man says well I the draft I
didn&#39;t want to kill anyone
and another woman says well I was a
junkie and I shot myself up with all
kinds of poison
I was stupid but I didn&#39;t hurt anyone
else and finally they get to this young
man who looks potentially more
bewildered than anyone else he says I
don&#39;t I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m here I don&#39;t
unless no that&#39;s crazy they wouldn&#39;t put
me here just for being gay
so the truck driver in his wisdom he
realizes these four are innocent and he
sets them go he let
out of the back of his truck and he lets
them go to points them in the general
direction of the high road and one of
the other things I really remember about
this moment in this experience was I was
watching it with someone else in my
family and this person who liked the
rest of my family didn&#39;t really buy into
the salvation being sold at our local
small town churches and wasn&#39;t fond of
Hellfire and brimstone
she didn&#39;t object to three of the people
being set go the the librarian the
draft-dodger and even the junkie but she
complained that last one that last one
was a mistake
gays belong in hell this gave me pause
this is about like 10 years before Ellen
Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet
it was you know about a decade before
the word transgender was being used and
I didn&#39;t really know what I was I just
knew like looking at myself and kind of
trying to figure myself out I was
different than my four brothers and you
know I any sense of what a gay man was
like was from in the 1980s the
television shows
they offered pretty stereotypical
portrayals of gay men and they just
seemed more like women you know they
were more flamboyant so I thought well
maybe that&#39;s me and I worried you know
do I just like a commentary that I had
belong in hell and in any moment you
know when I had a chance when I was by
myself you know I would I would dress up
and and I would dream of being a girl
but I knew that this wasn&#39;t acceptable
and I didn&#39;t you know really worried not
only just about my eternal salvation but
also just about my family&#39;s acceptance
of me and so when I went into high
school you know I did my best to really
pass as a boy I really you know I got
into fistfights I dated girls and I I
you know did everything I could to sort
of prove to myself my emerging manhood
and I even went started going to church
in my parents neighborhood and kind of
felt the presence of God for the first
time when I went to college I had I had
been telling myself for so long you know
when you grow up this will just go away
you know you can get rid of this so I&#39;m
going to conquer this
and I would hear people talk about you
know gays in particular and they&#39;d be
like oh they can&#39;t change that about
themselves thought that&#39;s a bunch of
liberal nonsense but by the time I got
to college in 1992 I was pretty aware
this isn&#39;t going away I&#39;m kind of an
adult now and I actually came out to my
college friends at the end of when I
finished my bachelor&#39;s degree and came
out as transgender and my interestingly
enough my faith in God started to
strengthen at this time not so much
about that with that fear of Hell but I
was more concerned logically that I
couldn&#39;t value other people if I didn&#39;t
value the universe in which we existed
in thought well it&#39;s not logical to care
about something inside of something else
that has no value and I didn&#39;t want love
to be this sort of self-serving illusion
this mere byproduct of survival and
evolution so by the time I&#39;m getting
ready to go to grad school I go back to
my parents house for the summer this is
1997 and I&#39;m thinking all I have kind of
maybe the low road or the high road
question again do I go down to grad
school and present as a trans woman do I
do I enter this sort of new life as
myself and it tore me up inside it was
like a tug of war on the inside and I
you know the biggest thing I still
didn&#39;t want to let down my family and I
had four brothers a sister two parents
and I also I just didn&#39;t want to be
rejected or causing any unnecessary pain
and so one night when I&#39;m home from work
during the summer time in my parents
house they&#39;re in bed I&#39;m just trying to
distract myself from this whole question
I&#39;m just trying to watch television and
flip through channels and I end up in
tears just with desperation like not
sure what to do and I get to this
televangelist and he&#39;s saying come to
the TV screen say this prayer with me
put your hands up to mine and accept the
love of Jesus in your heart accept him
as a saviour and despite my love of
logic and reason inexplicably I found
myself doing just that so when I went to
grad school I
as this confident sort of born-again
Christian who thought I could really
defeat my gender identity and I met a
girl and I fell in love with her at
first sight and we dated and I told her
well this is what I struggle with but I
think God he wants me to be a normal man
and so we were married for 17 years we
had six kids four adopted kids two
biological kids still have them and
during that time we you know I kept
going to church on Sunday I kept reading
the Bible maybe not habitually but
pretty regularly and I kept praying to
God to take this away from me because it
didn&#39;t go away I was sure if I was with
that beautiful woman I was sure that
would fix me I mean how could I not feel
like a man with this beautiful woman
next to me as my wife it didn&#39;t go away
and it kept causing issues in our
marriage and still you know I went to
men&#39;s group every week I opened up to
pastors I opened up to the men in my
men&#39;s group and I did two marathons and
you know kind of close to the end of our
marriage when things were really getting
bad I was like I&#39;ll just be really
masculine and I went got in shape did
marathons I did two tough mudders
you&#39;ve got electrocuted and did all
kinds of manly stuff and I felt kind of
manly but it still didn&#39;t get rid of
that inner sense that I wasn&#39;t a man
and so in 2015 my wife decided to
divorce and I don&#39;t blame her because
she was a heterosexual woman and I think
she kind of realized it&#39;s like okay this
this guy&#39;s having to struggle to be the
man that I was attracted to so you know
about two months after that divorce I
ended up contemplating that question
again the high road or the low road
which one is it and I prayed to God I
said which what do you want me to do now
God and I got this really interesting
answer that the greatest sin that I had
committed was not being able to be
authentic not being able to be honest
with myself and so about you know two
months ago after the divorce I decided
to accept myself for who I was and
this was pretty difficult I I had
previously rejected a lot of the
religious dogma and legalism that said
LGBT people are sinners are bad just for
being themselves
partly because those verses that the
pastors and the counselors would point
to when they were telling me to fix
myself when they were telling me this
was a sin when they were telling me this
was something I needed to cure or they
were comparing me to other sinners they
would point to these verses in the Bible
and the ones they pointed to who were
from the Old Testament and from Paul
from the writings of Paul and they were
next to passages that denied women the
right to teach the right to go outside
with their heads uncovered they were
right next to passages that were used to
justify slavery and they were next to
passages that even instructed parents to
stone their disobedient children to
death and when I looked at the Gospel
accounts of Jesus and his teaching his
example and his words I saw no common
condemnation for people like me so after
a little bit I chose this this tough
road and my children who I love and I
chose to stick around and be honest and
for them it was hard they as they turn
their backs on me to some degree before
you know basically blaming me for all
the changes in their life the divorce
and everything I just prayed to keep my
heart open to them and to love them no
matter what and so I I basically came
out a second time in 2016 and what I
knew would be a very difficult road and
the people in my church some of them
showed me the genuine love of Christ
some of them showed me more of what I
expected that rejection I so much feared
people are motivated by fear and hate by
things they don&#39;t understand and I had
friends that I had been friends with for
the better part of a decade who I didn&#39;t
hear from anymore
years still don&#39;t and if I run into them
you know I can see the looks of
condemnation the looks of judgment
sometimes the looks of even disgust and
when I asked my pastor if I could
continue going to my church he said you
will be a distraction I had a friend
from grade school who wrote a letter to
me and he says you have cut been cut
down by the enemy and he even expressed
the desire to cause physical harm to me
for transitioning and I you know I just
look at that and and also the messages
and culture that I hear about Who I am
that I&#39;m an affront to traditional
values that I&#39;m you know something
that&#39;s against the sanctity of marriage
and then I&#39;m you know of course a threat
to people in women&#39;s bathrooms James
Dobson who is a fundamentalist writer
and founder of Focus on the Family he
recently made comments that&#39;s implied
that real men should shoot transgender
women to protect their wives and their
children is it any wonder that
transgender people have a hard time
feeling loved feeling accepted or even
feeling like they can survive let me be
clear gays lesbians transgender people
they&#39;re just people and based on
everything we know now scientifically
they were most likely born that way even
some of those Christian counselors they
even accepted that they even admitted
that they just said this is a thorn in
your flesh you&#39;re gonna have to fight
for the rest of your life and just not
do it but God you know just for the
consideration of those of you who are
stuck on that binary between Adam and
Eve God has created there are 1 in 2,000
births that are intersexed babies that
are born blessed with the mixture of
male and female anatomy so God in His
wisdom has created a lot of diversity
with us and when gay and lesbian and
transgender people accept themselves for
who they are they&#39;re not choosing a
sinful lifestyle rather
they&#39;re choosing to survive they&#39;re
choosing to have the opportunity to love
and be loved
truly in return and this love thing
that&#39;s the real high road Christ when he
was asked by the Pharisees what is the
greatest commandment they thought there
have been really tricky like we have all
these rules and laws you know like skate
you to tell us the best one he said
here&#39;s the greatest commandment love the
Lord God with all your heart out of your
mind and all your soul and second love
your neighbor as you would love yourself
and all the law and the prophets hang
upon these two Commandments
so gays and lesbians and transgender
people in order to follow Christ&#39;s
teaching they need to be accepted into
the church welcomed and affirmed and
allowed to love God and they need to be
allowed to love themselves if they&#39;re
gonna follow the commandment that Christ
said is more important and what do I say
to those people those Christians who
recently drafted the nashville statement
this is a statement that basically
invalidates transgender gay people it
says they&#39;re unholy and beyond
redemption what do I say to these people
look very closely at Matthew 25 because
this is where Jesus says who was
traveling the low road makes it pretty
clear he&#39;s talking to two groups of
people and he says there&#39;s this one
group that&#39;s like the least so it&#39;s the
kind of the the lower members of society
and then this other group or these
self-righteous really assured people and
he shocks these self-righteous people he
looks at them he says be gone for me you
who are cursed to the fire that was
prepared for the devil and his angels he
didn&#39;t say this to him because there are
old librarians or junkies or draft
dodgers or even gay he said you when I
was hungry you didn&#39;t feed me when I was
thirsty you didn&#39;t give me drink when I
when I need a shelter you didn&#39;t open
your door to me when I was in prison and
sick you didn&#39;t show up you didn&#39;t show
up to come for me didn&#39;t help me they&#39;re
like oh you know Lord why wait when did
we not help you and he said whenever you
didn&#39;t help the least of these any of
these bless her people over here you did
not do that for me
so when you think about now as I stand
before you who are those who need help
who are the needy who are the least of
these today transgender people like
myself 60 over 60 about 65 percent of us
we report being physically abused being
the victims of violence over 40 percent
of us attempt suicide
so transgender people are in desperate
need of love and desperate need of
support in society and when Christ talks
about that low road you know who&#39;s going
to be traveling it it&#39;s those people who
mistook finger-pointing for holiness who
should have been opening their hearts
and their doors instead of slamming
doors in people&#39;s faces and when I think
about the imagery of the cattle trucks
and that Twilight Zone episode and
people being packed into these cars I
think about you know that early awful
time period in the 20th century when we
took those undesirables and we buried
them in mass graves and we leveled
cities with two nuclear bombs and wiped
out people and we invalidated entire
groups of people because we saw them as
different than ourselves a total
catastrophe in loving each other so
today I think we got to be careful our
focus on Hell doesn&#39;t get in a way of
preventing the hell that can exist for
people right now in this life and for me
thankfully in this life there&#39;s also joy
so when I go home and I go to school
after work and I pick up my two boys my
9 year old and my five year old my five
year old comes running up to me
routinely
embraces me in the biggest hug he can
give me Annie says I have missed you
daddy
at night when I tucked my 9 year old
into bed and I read him a story he looks
at me and he says I love you daddy
you&#39;re a good dad and when we pray at
dinner and we pray for our whole family
we pray for those who aren&#39;t at my table
anymore
but are still in my heart and my faith
is so strong very strong that love is
more than a mere illusion it&#39;s a
commodity that we need to share with
each other it&#39;s a necessary commodity to
all of our survival thank you
