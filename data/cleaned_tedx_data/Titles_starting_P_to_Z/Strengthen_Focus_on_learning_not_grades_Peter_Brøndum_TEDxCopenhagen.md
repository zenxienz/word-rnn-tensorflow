a couple of years ago while I was doing
an exercise with some of my students
there was an identity and social role
social roles and one of the students
there asked me Peter do you actually
know how important grades are to me to
us she said and she continued I think
about grades all the time I think about
grades when I&#39;m at home doing my
homework while I&#39;m writing my
assignments while I go to school while
I&#39;m in class great in the back of my
mind all time one of the other students
was in that group said I totally agree
with that and in some way I think the
student said I think that grades there
sometimes there&#39;s somehow determined how
I behave in school what I do what I say
what I don&#39;t say what I write what I
don&#39;t write 24/7 my behavior is
determined by grades of course I know
that great importance to students after
all they have to use them afterwards but
it was quite shocking for me that grades
had become such a dominant it was so
influential on the students behavior and
I was also sad because I&#39;d always
thought of myself as the teacher who was
able to present a learning room in where
there were a lot of fun a lot of create
creativeness a lot of place for
experimentals
but I had to realize I had to recognize
that this was certainly not the case
because the student they told me that I
also was very keen on their performances
and giving them great and I in somehow
were more focused on the higher grades
learned a little great now I&#39;m here
today to share with you my idea that
we need to focus on learning and not
great
where&#39;s grades of these you could say
measurement says the way we measure
students in in certain criterias in a
specific curriculum now learning is
something different because learning and
learning processes is a rule where the
student is allowed to be creative it&#39;s
allowed to be experimental it&#39;s allowed
to make mistakes to even fail but along
the way they will and somehow be able to
manage the challenges now I&#39;m not
opposed to great as such but I am really
opposed to the way that we have allowed
grades to penetrate and colonize the way
we educate people and in the way the
students are impacted by it and in my
talk today I will focus on three things
I will focus on why we see this
phenomenon of the great impact of great
and young students life and I will also
look into some of the consequences and
finally I will give you just a short
presentation of some of the results that
we have had with this project free of
grades if we also understand why rates
have become so important to students and
the social surrounding especially the
social medias this we see another funny
not funny but interesting phenomenon and
that is what I would call Instagram
parenting and you&#39;ve probably seen that
a lot back in June because Instagram
parenting that is parents standing with
their children and praising them for
their great academic achievements and
they post a picture and they&#39;re writing
something like once again Carl nailed it
at the green table 12
of course we doesn&#39;t often hear Peter
did a fine job he just made it through
high school I&#39;m so proud of him what a
man he has become we don&#39;t hear that but
we hear Carl and his grade of 12
now there&#39;s nothing wrong being a proud
parent we should all be proud parents
but we just need to understand that this
pressure that the social surroundings
create for the young student and the
pressure that the young student creates
for him or herself means that I density
from high school students perspective is
often I understand myself because I am
my grades going to my everyday life one
of my student once told me that she was
doing she was training because she had
to do very good in athletics now my
student was anxious because she knew
that she had to do very well in three
different disciplines running long jump
high jump and she was very good in both
running and long term so that was not
the problem but the problem of course
was the third one hi John she was not
good in that she really just she was
really bad here now she told me that she
sat down and she calculated okay what to
do got the best opportunity to have a
higher grade and then she said then she
somehow reason her way to that okay the
day we run I come the day we jump long
long jump
I will come and the day we are to do the
high jump I will call in sick now I&#39;m a
responsible student and my teachers they
will probably think of me as one who
actually was ill I cannot be certain of
that but I would do that
so my behavior will be termined for that
because I need that great for later in
my life now you can probably imagine
that this create a lot of stress a lot
of pressure because I could tell you
hundreds of these doors and now stress
is something that we don&#39;t like in
education and especially not in the
learning room because stress reduces the
ability to learn quite dramatically
looking out on studies on a national
basis we know that around 50 percent of
all high school students I stressed up
as the top 20% of the most stress in the
Danish workforce now to bring in bring
that in here in this room we could say
that
and the two sides over here all of you
sitting over there you will probably
find yourself in a situation where your
darkness would be pretty worried because
you would be at risk of developing
psychiatric disorders such as severe
depressions eating disorders or even
anxiety so so this is of course a huge
problem for us
so we need to change that and what I
suggest and what we have tried to do is
in some way to establish a different
learning culture and to address that we
need to focus on learning and reduce the
amount of grades and one thing we have
tried to work on is this what we call an
ideal speed situation it sounds very
interesting but it&#39;s a it&#39;s it&#39;s not
complex it&#39;s very simple it&#39;s just you
and a teacher sitting down and try to
talk on how to learn a subject how to
learn a course and try to establish a
trusting relation and the teacher so
that the student will actually tell the
teacher how they think they progress in
a course in a subject what questions
they very much would like to ask but are
too afraid of asking in other places a
place our situation where you can be
creative where there&#39;s room for doing
mistakes where there&#39;s room for trying
something into the unknown which is
seldom in our educational system a
different thing we try to establish was
this free and open minded learning
culture among the students if you in
this room just try to imagine or
remember how it was like to sit in a
classroom many years ago afraid of
saying something because you just you
just knew that everyone around you they
were on the edge of their chair to
either laugh of you if you said
something wrong or to eat you alive if
you made a mistake now even though this
is often not the case it is a tremendous
social Dominator in a client in a
classroom so we have to change that and
the way we try to change that
was by teaching the teachers actually to
praise to recognize but also to
acknowledge all the academic commitments
and all the work and discipline the
students put in to their school work but
also to when they were discussing in
class when they were saying something
where they were uncertain when they were
doing mistakes where they were trying to
be experimental even though we was quite
wrong so by opening up the learning room
we actually tried to create a more free
and a more safe haven for these students
are we looking in if we look to some of
the results from our project and I think
we answer something here we saw that the
students in this class had the highest
well-being and was the most motivated
among their fellow students and they&#39;re
here group there was also a very low
stress level among these students
interesting was also that there was a
low absence these students they actually
came into school they liked coming into
school and that is of course good
because when you have your students in
your classroom you can probably learn
them something and last but not least
the students in this group they did
absolute best at the test and at the egg
exams in the end of the school year now
this is my conviction that we need to
strengthen our focus on learning in our
educational institutions system and we
need to reduce the amount and the impact
of grades on young students life because
it actually have a too great influence
on their behavior and I think that we
need to do it because it will help the
young student to progress to both
academically but also personal to
develop to be more certain of themselves
even in places where they are uncertain
but I also think that from a society
kind of view we will benefit far more if
we in our educational system actually
educate young people with self-esteem
with a belief in themselves with an
ability to embrace uncertainty when they
meet it because uncertainty is a natural
condition of life and they actually need
to embrace this uncertainty because we
do not need people only to reproduce
what we already know we need them to go
out there and meet the challenges where
there is no certain there is no
definition there&#39;s no endpoint now one
of my students the students have just
mentioned early on she told me she was
part of the project here and she told me
just before the summer holidays that she
was she just did an interview with the
journalist and the journalist wanted to
hear what the student had experienced
throughout the project and while the
student was answering the questions from
that the journalists put forward the
student realized that something had
really changed for her early on she was
only focused on performance on grades
and now she could hear herself and
understand herself that he/she had
actually made a shift to watch learning
and towards mastering coping and what
actually could that she suddenly
realized that was because you could hear
synthesis that she was saying she would
just hear yourself saying now I feel
that over the last few years I have been
allowing myself to do something which I
didn&#39;t do before
I now do mistakes and now allow myself
to stand in front of my classmates
maybe it&#39;s embarrassing but I allow
myself to do it I try to do it and I
feel strengthened by it
I actually feel I&#39;m better able today to
embrace things I do not know the outcome
up now I think those reflections by the
student extremely important for us to
and thereupon for me to share with you
because I really think that we need to
break out of this iron cage of
rationality and allow from far more
uncertainty in our educational system
thank you
