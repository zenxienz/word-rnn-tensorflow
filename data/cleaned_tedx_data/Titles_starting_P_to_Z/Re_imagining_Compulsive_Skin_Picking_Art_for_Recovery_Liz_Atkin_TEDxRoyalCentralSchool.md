I have a compulsive disorder a disorder
that I didn&#39;t know had a name for more
than 20 years of my life
this disorder dominated everything about
me and I&#39;m going to tell you a bit about
that story and what I&#39;ve done to cope
with that and transform it and turn it
into something beyond anything I could
have imagined this is my face these
marks and wounds on my face are not acne
these are wounds I&#39;ve created compulsive
skin picking is a complex physical and
mental disorder
it affects people in many ways and in my
personal experience from the age of six
or seven this disorder became a complex
part of how I functioned every day I
would pick the skin around my fingers as
a young child&#39;s skin picking is a very
normal thing for pretty much every human
but some of us develop this in a much
more complex way and that skin picking
escalated
I would pick my back my face my fingers
my chest the heels of my feet I would
wake up with blood on my bedsheets it
absolutely dominated how I would dress
the clothing I would wear was absolutely
hidden and disguising the marks on my
body I didn&#39;t own a t-shirt for 10 years
but part of my story is theater so I
studied theater and this is part of how
the dichotomy in my life has led me to
this place
studying theater means you stand up in
front of people and you present the body
you speak you share your stories and the
stories of others but I had marks and
wounds all over my body and was very
very very frightened of letting those
things be seen skin picking changed for
me dramatically when I was 30 so between
the age of six and thirty this disorder
was a daily part of my
struggle the guilt and shame surrounding
this disorder is absolutely enormous I
didn&#39;t tell anyone in my life aside from
family members that this was even
something I was struggling with and at
the age of 30 I signed up to do a
master&#39;s in dance quite a challenging
thing for someone with skin picking it
was a life-changing moment we were
encouraged to take a video camera into a
dance studio and record pedestrian
movement in the first week of that
course and I did the exercise when I
turned the video round and played it
back I lasted fractions of a second
before my hands went up to my face and I
started picking up my face over the
course of two hours with streaming tears
falling down my face I watched my
disorder on the screen and something
occurred to me
skin picking has become a dance in my
life the repeated movement patterns of
this disorder are like a dance so skin
picking is common one in 25 have this
disorder this is a statistic I
discovered at that point I googled skin
picking first time I&#39;d ever looked for
this information online and all this
information came up and I realized this
is a very common disorder there are
probably people in this room who know
what I&#39;m talking about
you may have heard of the hair-pulling
disorder where people pull out their
hair because they&#39;re stressed or anxious
this is the sister disorder to that so
what do you do now medication can really
help CBT cognitive behavioral therapy is
also a route that you might go down if
you&#39;re having treatment for this
disorder and these can be extremely
valuable but I didn&#39;t access those
things I started making artwork about
what the disorder felt like what I&#39;m
about to show you is not something that
came easily this took me several years
and in fact it&#39;s been ten years of
making artwork about the disorder for me
this is what my skin feels like every
day even standing here now my skin feels
like it has a texture on it that I need
to pick off it&#39;s a very strange thing to
describe to people that don&#39;t know what
that feels like and I started
reimagining
body slowly over ten years I started
working with a camera and I was coming
from a dance and theater tradition not
from an art tradition and these images
began to help me reimagine and re claim
the skin that had damaged and distressed
me for so long I started to work with
galleries and exhibitions but life
changed very dramatically for me in 2014
life threw me a curveball I&#39;d worked
full-time and I was tired I wasn&#39;t
sleeping I was very stressed I was very
anxious my skin picking returned very
badly so art although it was helping me
it&#39;s not a cure and it wasn&#39;t stopping
it from happening completely and I had
an accident at home I fell down the
stairs the next morning I got up and
went to work I was bruised I felt really
shaken and I had an out-of-body
experience at my computer I now know
that&#39;s a dissociative state that&#39;s
associated with severe depression and
chronic anxiety I saw a doctor the same
day and I was signed off work ten months
of sick leave followed I went from being
a professional functioning human being
to someone in a dressing gown who
couldn&#39;t leave the house all those
mental health statistics you hear about
happened to me people left my life
people stopped calling people didn&#39;t
know what to say and around the same
time I was asked to make artwork by a
gallery that I&#39;d made a connection with
called the Bethlem gallery it&#39;s the
world&#39;s oldest psychiatric hospital and
I&#39;d connected with them through the skin
picking artwork the artwork I made saved
my life
I was asked to make work for the anxiety
festival at the point where I had the
biggest anxiety attack of my life what
is that is that serendipity I don&#39;t know
I took the challenge and this artwork a
year later was shown in a solo
exhibition in Los Angeles in a hospital
this changed my life
saved my life and around the same time
someone bought me a box of charcoal and
this is the thing I&#39;m now known for
which he
crazy I started drawing I hadn&#39;t really
drawn since I was a teenager and drawing
has become the best tool to help me
with this disorder if there&#39;s no cure
for skin picking and I feel it
physically in my body every day
everywhere I am drawing shifts that
energy and one day I was on the train
drawing in a sketchbook and I&#39;d got a
job in North London so I was commuting
from south to north London it&#39;s a
two-hour commute and panic attacks were
still happening so I was having to
battle that on the cheap she was not
easy in the best of times
and one day my sketchbook ran out
another moment of serendipity the
carriage was littered with newspapers
and I felt the panic attack rising I
looked to my fingers and I was picking
my fingers and I thought if I don&#39;t do
something my hands are gonna be bleeding
by the time I get to work I picked up a
newspaper and I doodled on it I liked it
I shared the photo on social media loads
of people went what&#39;s this graffiti this
is so cool I left it on the train I just
I left it on the seat beside me when I
got on the train on the way home I did
the same thing because I still didn&#39;t
have a sketchbook that has turned into
something I do every single day on the
way here today I gave away 20 drawings
to strangers in the carriage I realized
very quickly that the act of drawing in
a public place on a newspaper is a bit
odd people look people wonder and you
know that thing of people checking out
what you&#39;re doing over your shoulder on
the tube I could feel that as a person
with a performance background it&#39;s it&#39;s
very present
so I started leaning across and saying
would you like this drawing people don&#39;t
know what to do lots of people say no no
thank you
Oh would you would you like this drawing
person next to me yeah very quickly I
realized that the person that didn&#39;t get
the drawing is then a bit sad and once
the drawing so then I do another drawing
you do want a drawing don&#39;t you and I
passed them the drawing
so this accumulating a creative moment
through an act of drawing becomes a
moment of connection why are you drawing
oh I&#39;m drawing because I&#39;ve got a mental
health problem and I pick my fingers
really badly and actually I get panic
attacks often many many times a day the
person declares something of their own
experience of mental health little
conversations about mental health start
happening those are moments of
connection and I realize that for all
those conversations I have with the
person that gets the drawing there&#39;s
another 15 or 20 people that witness it
so I started carrying a postcard because
I can&#39;t talk to them all but I can pass
out a postcard around the carriage the
postcard says I have a compulsive
disorder what you&#39;re witnessing is about
mental health and recovery this is what
is helping me right now in this moment
but it&#39;s also an act of kindness I don&#39;t
need the drawings I just need to do them
Londoners started getting involved
sharing their drawings on social media
and it starts to spread this message
this spread this message of recovery and
then suddenly invitations to do this in
other cities start presenting themselves
so in January I went to the em1
Singapore Fringe Festival and I gave
away 600 drawings in 10 days to people
in the carriages to people at
universities and hospitals who are
studying psychology looking at mental
health trying to think of different ways
to access recovery routes for people
living with conditions such as mine skin
picking gets very little press many
people suffer
I meet people every single day on the
train and on the tube
who say that I have that
that moment of connection might change
their life and in many cases it does I
get emails through my website or people
contacting me on Twitter thanking me for
speaking out about the disorder I&#39;m up
to 15,000 free drawings that&#39;s 15,000
conversations and 15,000 individuals but
many more that have received the
postcard or been in the carriage acts of
kindness becomes something much bigger
for me and for them it&#39;s been picked up
by the press and for me that&#39;s another
moment to talk publicly about this
disorder to think that I couldn&#39;t even
wear a short sleeve top like I am today
15 years ago that moment of recovery
becomes a much bigger message that if
you are suffering ways of getting better
are possible and they&#39;re not always the
route that takes you through medication
and I speak out every time I get asked
so today is no different
it&#39;s terrifying to stand up and talk
about this disorder every time because
it exposes something that I&#39;ve lived
with and struggled with but I don&#39;t know
who in this audience or who watching may
need to know it they&#39;re not alone and
this disorder doesn&#39;t need to completely
stop your life it&#39;s not a cure but for
me I&#39;m in collaboration with this
disorder this is my performance
collaboration every single day if I am
never cured I&#39;d rather have a
comfortable life with this disorder and
this image is the last one I want to
show you this is the image of my fingers
drawing quite obviously it&#39;s also the
position my fingers used to pick my body
in that pinched tight position is so
familiar to my body
but every time I&#39;m drawing it&#39;s a
mindful gentle calm act and it
reimagines that disorder into something
positive for me and for others
thank you
you
