I loved he-man and one year for my
birthday I got all the he-man gear I got
the action figures the big wheel I got
the he-man underwear and the sword and
the shield I used to love to run around
pretending that I was he man one thing I
do remember about he-man is that he was
just a regular guy until he needed to
take control of a situation when he did
he would raise his sword just like this
and he would say I have the power and he
would transform and use all of his
potential and I see a lot of folks in
here with a lot of potential and I
invite you to stand up with me so we can
begin to transform together go ahead and
grab your imaginary he-man sword and
raise it up and on the count of three
we&#39;re going to say I have the power
together one two three I have the power
that was fantastic I really felt the
power from you guys thank you so much
please have a seat
really great job now as I got a little
older I didn&#39;t have the sword anymore
and I began to forget that I had the
power which also meant that I didn&#39;t
transform or use the most of my
potential and then I started to use
ready reflecting evaluating developing
and implementing to make sure that I had
my power and was using the most of my
potential here&#39;s how it started after 14
years of martial arts training I
received an invitation to world
champions
this was a pro-am competition so it was
professional and amatuer competitors
competing against one another
this invitation changed my life I had
been training in martial arts for 14
years and done so many competitions so I
thought I knew what to do so I began
doing the normal routine practicing
training all the way up until the
competition we arrived the night before
and walked into this room that was
enormous it was at least three times
bigger than any competition I had been
to before as I looked it out across the
room 10 foot by 10 foot squares were
taped all across the floor except for
one in the middle it looked like a
boxing ring and I&#39;d never seen that
before
what was it as I reviewed my competition
details I realized that I would be
competing in forms routines in that ring
the next morning cool the morning of the
competition I got up and it did not take
long for me to realize the professionals
from the amateurs I was doing karate and
they were doing ninja I felt a little
out of place
later that day in fighting you could say
I deserve some respect for how clean I
was able to get those floors I was
disappointed in my results in both have
you ever felt that way you&#39;ve done all
the things that you were supposed to do
your training practice you&#39;ve met all
the expectations and you just don&#39;t feel
like it was quite good enough on a long
five hour car ride home
I spent time reflecting on my
formants honestly it was probably the
next couple of weeks - I was really
disappointed in my performance at World
Championships I thought that was my shot
when I thought about the performance a
lot of the competitors did backflips and
I could do backflips but I didn&#39;t do any
some did what we call extreme kicks and
I could do some extreme kicks but I
didn&#39;t do any I had trained in tumbling
for six years at this point and the
original purpose to Train and tumbling
was to integrate that into my martial
arts routines and the only thing that
I&#39;d done with my tumbling at this point
was to try and impress girls and that
wasn&#39;t working well either I realized
that I had just been coasting I had
developed skills and abilities over the
years that I was totally ignoring and
just doing the usual routine it can be
same in the workplace when we caught
when we get caught in doing just the
normal routine there&#39;s no doubt that so
many of us are busy between emails and
phone calls meetings working with
coworkers or customers have you taken a
moment to think about what you&#39;re doing
why you&#39;re doing it and how that&#39;s
impacting you chances are if you took a
moment to step back and reflect on your
experience you would see a lot of
possibilities for positive improvements
as I begin to evaluate my performance I
thought back to before the competition
the feedback that I received was that I
had good stances good follow-through
I had snap power focus timing I met all
the marks but when I started to think
about all that I was capable of what
would my best performance look like if I
took some of that tumbling skills that I
had and I took some of those extreme
kicks and I mixed them together into a
routine and it had good balance that is
what a good routine would look like for
me so I realized what I had done before
it was average in the workplace we have
the minimum standards standards and
expectations our leaders and managers
expect us to meet those standards but if
you think about your skills and your
abilities and the things that you&#39;re
capable of are you making the most out
of your experience the next thing I did
was start developing a plan I decided I
was gonna go back to World Championships
the next year I decided I was going to
focus on one thing instead of doing
forms and fighting I was gonna do forms
because all of my skills and abilities
all pointed to that and that&#39;s where I
could make the biggest impact I
developed my plan and included the right
people those individuals who could give
me the type of feedback that would help
me move forward one person I connected
with was a gymnastics coach I didn&#39;t
have a lot of space in that ten-by-ten
ring to get a running start so I needed
to figure out how to get more power out
of my tumbling by including the right
people I was able to ensure that we were
moving forward together and by sharing
up
and we were on the right path in the
workplace it&#39;s no different I would
encourage you to develop a plan and
share that with the right people think
about your work situation chances are
their skills and abilities that you
could integrate into your work that
would make a better impact for you and
in turn make a better impact for those
working around you by sharing your plan
and the things that you&#39;re interested in
the goals you&#39;re going toward you could
include the right people so that you are
driving the feedback process and not
simply waiting for somebody to tell you
what they&#39;re expecting from you align
your path so you can move forward
together next I had to implement I began
training at the karate gym practicing at
the tumbling gym and on the weekends I
would go out to the park and practice my
routine I was taking all the things that
were available to me and integrating
that into my regular routine I would try
something if it didn&#39;t work
I&#39;d make adjustments and try it again I
was reflecting evaluating developing and
implementing and I was seeing some good
results when you think about your
experience at work are the things that
you&#39;re planning that you&#39;ve been
developing are those important enough
for you to follow up on we need to take
action before we can get the feedback on
that action both from ourselves and from
those leaders managers and possibly
co-workers the trusted friend that can
help give you the feedback to move you
forward the next year I went back to
world championships and I felt like I
won the championships when I placed
fifth I never thought I&#39;d be so excited
about placing fifth
but I knew I had done for myself what
nobody else could do for me I was the
best me I gave my 100% I gave my all
into doing that and I didn&#39;t feel
average I felt great I felt awesome
and that was my reward for that
competition are you ready to make the
most of your power and unleash your
potential because only you know exactly
what you need to make the most of your
experience and be the best you thank you
