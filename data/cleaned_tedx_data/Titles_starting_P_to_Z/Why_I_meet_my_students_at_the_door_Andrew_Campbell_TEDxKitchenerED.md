the one question we should be able to
answer about education is what are
school supposed to be good at
surprisingly there&#39;s not much agreement
on this oh people will talk to you all
day about what schools are not good at
but if you&#39;re looking for consensus on
what the main mission of schools is
supposed to be there isn&#39;t any that&#39;s
what I&#39;m going to talk about tonight now
the fact that I have any sort of
informed a pain at all on this is a
little bit of a surprise to me
firstly because I never really expected
to be a teacher and secondly because
even though I&#39;ve been teaching for a
while I don&#39;t think of myself as a good
teacher now I should explain I think I
can help kids learn but what I mean is
if you close your eyes and think of a
good teacher you&#39;re probably not
imagining someone like me there&#39;s lots
of things about schools that I just
don&#39;t agree with my favorite thing in
the world is not a well-planned lesson
I&#39;m not good working with others and I
don&#39;t really like sharing and so given
all that you can probably appreciate
that at times it&#39;s been frustrating for
me to be a teacher but I&#39;ve persevered
and I&#39;ve persevered in part because I
think I have a noble purpose before I
became a teacher I worked in secure
custody with young offenders and that
work was exhilarating challenging
sometimes frightening but ultimately
frustrating because we would work with
the young person we&#39;d move them forward
make their lives better we&#39;d help them
get ahead and then when their time with
us was up we&#39;d return them right back to
the very conditions that created the
problem in the first place and they&#39;d
often riaf end and it became obvious to
me that if I was ever going to make a
difference in the life of youth at risk
I needed to be proactive I need to get
to them before they got themselves in
trouble and teaching seemed to offer a
pathway to that so I went to Teachers
College and even though I&#39;ve been
teaching now for over two decades that
remains one of my main motivations for
being a teacher trying to help youth at
risk and it was one of my main
motivations for being a teacher 13 years
ago when I started the school year with
a grade 7 class now the start of the
school year for me is really only about
two things it&#39;s about helping students
understand how our class runs and how it
operates how we&#39;re going to work
together and forming relationships and
this particularly R I was struggling to
connect with one student Fraser was
physically small not a great student and
he wanted nothing to do with having a
relationship with me sometimes the only
thing he would do to acknowledge my
presence
would be when I would ask him to put his
skateboard away in his locker and he&#39;d
look at me and say no he spent most of
his time in my class reading books about
his favorite TV show Dragon Ball Z
[Applause]
drawing or talking to his friends
[Applause]
it looked like it was going to be a
tough year and then partway through the
second week we had a minor breakthrough
it was a beautiful fall day sunny but
not hot leaves just starting to change
and we had phys ed at the end of the day
so I took the class outside and we
played soccer amazingly Fraser
participated not strictly true he threw
himself into the game with unbridled
enthusiasm he was wearing pants that
were maybe three sizes too big and he
would take five steps and his pants
would start to fall down so he&#39;d stop
and pull them up and then run again it
looked hilarious by the end of the game
he had given up completely and was just
running around holding his pants up but
when the the bell rang and he walked off
the field his face was red with effort
he was sweaty but he had a big smile on
it and he walked past me and he picked
up his skateboard in his bag and then he
stopped and he turned and for the first
time he waved to me and I thought nice
and as he walked away sort of
silhouetted against the Sun I thought I
think we have a little something there a
little connection I think we can work
with that
but it was a busy day lot to do so I
grabbed my stuff and I went inside and I
started getting ready for the next day
the following morning I was driving to
school and I went past the house that
had yellow tape around it and two police
cars waiting out front
and I wondered why and when I got to
school I was surprised to find the front
doors unlocked and the principal waiting
inside for me he assured me into his
office closed the door and started to
cry and when he stopped he told me that
Fraser had killed himself
now it&#39;s a cliche that during times of
crisis things move like they&#39;re in slow
motion but that&#39;s exactly how we
remember the next two weeks I remember
class meetings where the grief
counselors talked to students just to
numb with grief to listen I remember
taking boys down to the gym who punched
blue mats and screamed out why until
their hands were sore and red and I
remember the staff meeting where the
police came and they told us what they
knew about Frazier&#39;s death which was
almost nothing than half of our staff
broke down crying there was a memorial
service where I got up and spoke about a
boy I&#39;d known for six days and tried to
say something that would comfort a
grieving family there was a memorial
stone out in front of the school that we
dedicated to Frazier and there was an
open casket funeral with lots and lots
of crying students I&#39;d given Frazier the
locker right outside our classroom
because I thought that would be easier
for him because I&#39;d have to keep
reminding him to put his skateboard away
and it would be a shorter journey now
the locker loomed at us every time we
walked in and out of the classroom there
it was reminding us of what had happened
his things were still inside it his
lunch bag his drawings his Dragon Ball Z
books his pencils I didn&#39;t know what to
do with them
it felt disrespectful to move them and
then students started to decorate the
front of Locke or they put streamers
they wrote notes it made it impossible
not to notice and then I came into
school one day and it was all gone so
wondered
the locker and right away I missed it as
with all tragedy life goes on and that&#39;s
what happened to us
slowly boom surely life went on people
went back to what they were doing
normally except for me
I couldn&#39;t let it go weeks months even
years later I apply myself thinking
about it and asking myself did I do
enough when he was with me could I have
done something that would have made a
difference when he walked away from me
on the night he died did he know that he
mattered now I know that&#39;s irrational
and I knew that then as a teacher I can
have a significant influence on the life
of a student but compared to the life
outside my classroom my powers are
pretty limited students spend less than
20% of their time in class and so while
society would like us to believe that
schools are powerful and can fix
anything like drug addiction or smoking
or sexual health or obesity or coding or
math scores our ability to change things
is actually pretty limited we can&#39;t do
everything and this is especially true
for a student at risk because no matter
what we do for that student no matter
how much we tell them that we care how
much we feed them give them school
supplies show them the right way to do
things and say to them hey you know what
hang in there kid because soon things
are going to get better and you&#39;re gonna
make a difference in your life and the
life of every other person around you no
matter how much we do that at the end of
the day they walk out of our classroom
I&#39;m back into the world that put them at
risk in the first place for some kids
the world is a cruel place and there&#39;s
not much we can do to change
is that but that was my rational mind
and no matter how hard I tried to
irrational doubts would creep in here
was one of those kids that had led me to
teaching in the first place one of those
kids I&#39;d pledged to help a kid battered
by forces too powerful for him to handle
a kid who needed a life raft or maybe a
life preserver with a rope and someone
to pull him to shore I missed one a few
years later I decided to write about
what had happened try to make some sense
out of it and when I shared my writing
an incredible thing happened the
students who&#39;d sat in my classroom
crying the ones who&#39;d gone to the gym
and punched the blue mats read what I
wrote and they wrote back to me and they
told me something I&#39;d never even
considered they told me I was wrong they
told me the story of Frazier wasn&#39;t the
story of the kid I missed they said it
was a story of the 26 thirteen year olds
that I had helped negotiate through
tragedy they talked about how I&#39;d stood
with them and how I&#39;d supported them
Leslie wrote your stability through that
rocky September was profound for all of
us students thank you for teaching but
more importantly your caring I&#39;d never
thought of that so what did I learn from
all this
what did Frazier&#39;s death teach me the
most important thing I can do as a
teacher are the relationships I formed
with my students and the relationships I
helped them form with others when my
students come to me in the morning I
don&#39;t know where they&#39;re coming from and
I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re carrying and
when they leave at the end of the day I
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re walking into
so each morning I stand outside my
classroom and I greet them I look them
in the eye I smile at them I say their
names every one of them and I welcome
them and throughout the day I try to
find time to be with them and I listen
to their stories and I tell them my
stories and sometimes I try to make them
laugh and at the end of the day when
it&#39;s time for them to leave I look them
in the eyes again I say their name and I
tell them to be careful now I know this
is not much it&#39;s not going to fix
anyone&#39;s math scores but I think it
matters a lot in a busy classroom it&#39;s
easy to miss one and I don&#39;t want to
take a chance I want them to know that I
see them and that they matter the thing
we need schools to be good at most of
all is helping our students to be more
fully human helping them to work
together to learn how to laugh together
how to ask for and receive help how to
give help to someone how to stand up for
someone who needs someone to do that how
to stand together in crisis and we need
our schools to do this most of all
because if our students don&#39;t understand
the importance of being connected with
each other then none of the hundreds of
other things we try to teach them are
going to make much difference in their
lives at all
