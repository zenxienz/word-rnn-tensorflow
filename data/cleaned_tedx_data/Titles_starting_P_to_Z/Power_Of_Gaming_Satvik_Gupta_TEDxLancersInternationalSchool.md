power of gaming whenever someone says
this word power and gaming it&#39;s
interesting because the first image
which comes into my head whenever
somebody says gaming is of a 24 year old
guy living in his parents basement
having pizza boxes lying around and
playing video games all day isn&#39;t that&#39;s
what gaming about well raise your hands
if you think gaming is stupid okay
perfect so today I&#39;m going to show you
guys how gaming had a huge impact on my
life my own story I was in grade seven
and I was 12 years old when my friend
told me about this awesome website
called Facebook it&#39;s a social media
platform as all of us know where you can
talk to your friends family share
pictures etc it&#39;s also a great platform
of businesses these days to promote
their business however as a
twelve-year-old I really did not care
about all these fancy features what I
did care about was gaming I had a
passion for gaming from a very young age
so the first thing I did right after
creating my Facebook account I went to
the gaming section and I saw that there
there is a huge list of games I was
surprised and I chose but this
particular X game it caught my attention
it had a whole line marketplace where
you can trade virtual items so let me
give you an example so for example if
you have a machine gun a v8 I have a
knife we both can come to this
marketplace and exchange our items wow
that was pretty interesting for the 12
year old me so did I also noticed that
there&#39;s a little chat box inside the
game where all the players of this game
are talking they are talking about how
bad they want these items but they can&#39;t
get it I asked myself why can&#39;t they get
it then well these items they were
limited there was no way to get these
items no way but there was one way which
is that they could they have to trade in
the marketplace itself there is no other
way
so now I really wanted to provide this
players with items virtual items but
there was this small problem I had zero
items as I said guys I&#39;ve I created my
Facebook account that very day so I
asked myself a very simple question who
owns the most items in the game who is
that one rich guy
now that&#39;s no-brainer it&#39;s the developer
itself because if you have created a
game then you have access to this
magical thing called database from
database you can add as many items as
you want to your account or anyone&#39;s
account and who has who has access to
this as I said it&#39;s a developer itself
so now I wrote a message to this
developer I told him that I want to buy
many items from him for real money but
here&#39;s the secret sauce guys I quoted
him a very low price you guys can say it
was dirt cheap it was nothing few hours
passed and I finally saw one new door
one new notification in my Facebook Park
I thought it is some silly game invite
or something like that but I was wrong
it was it was a reply from this
developer and the best part is he
accepted my offer Wow guys I can proudly
say that well it was one of the happiest
moments in my life because as I
initially initially said I did not
expect him to reply
so now let&#39;s break down my journey of
what I did with this virtual items my
very first part was I was looking for
customers because without customers our
businesses fail if you can if you don&#39;t
gain if you don&#39;t get sales you get no
money and there goes your business I did
this by taking advantage of of Facebook
on Facebook you can join these groups
which are made by people I saw that
there are many groups about this game so
I joined them I started posting golfers
and I also started vert vert izing about
myself in the chat box soon enough in
few hours I got over 100 messages my my
message box was exploded with these
messages great next part sales talk now
while I was too
to these people my potential customers
it&#39;s not a sales talk it&#39;s how you
convince convince these potential
customers to buy from you and not anyone
else because over hundreds of sellers
were selling the same thing and and and
he would ask yourself that why would
they buy from me then well it&#39;s it&#39;s the
power of USP unique selling point
my USP was I was selling these items at
a lower price than what my competitors
were selling it this caught their
attention like how this guy can do that
so now I had a great product and I got
this potential customers so you guys
must be thinking that wow this guy&#39;s
done that&#39;s all right well guys the
truth is this was the time when when the
real struggle began lack of trust they
did not believe me how can I sell these
items at a lower price they and it&#39;s and
then I thought about it from their
perspective it&#39;s actually true like if
you see someone who started playing a
game two days ago and now he&#39;s one of
the richest players in the game how&#39;s
that possible so now I knew that there
is this lack of there is this problem of
lack of trust and I have to solve that
how can I solve that well I have to
spread the word about myself in the
market so they know that this guy&#39;s not
fake is not a scammer he&#39;s the real deal
YouTube guys YouTube it&#39;s one of the
biggest video sharing platforms over
hundreds of videos uploaded every minute
and I decided to took take advantage of
that I created a YouTube channel with my
own name and I started uploading videos
of me trading with other people so for
example even if I did one deal to do 3
deals per day I would take that time to
record this videos edit them and then
upload on YouTube
what did this do to me well guys this
this changed my life actually because
now all of the potential customers in
the game who were not believing me
started believing me because if they ask
me how can we trust you
I would link them to my youtube channel
like you guys can see
I have done trades in past and I&#39;m not a
scammer so it worked pretty well for me
so now I&#39;m going to talk about making
videos editing them you guys must be
thinking that it has costed me a fortune
like all these expensive softwares and
high tech computers well that&#39;s not true
I actually spent $0 in making my videos
$0 guys how I did that Windows Movie
Maker it&#39;s a free software which came
with my laptop it&#39;s a free software and
it worked pretty well so my point is
that gaming has taught me so much that I
would have never learned without gaming
gaming has taught me so much it has
taught me how to be a sales guy how to
talk to different potential customers
how to how to record videos how to
upload them how to edit them Gaming has
taught me so much guys
find your passion the money is a mere
side effect now when I say it&#39;s a side
effect I do not mean that it is
something negative or something bad but
I simply mean that it is something which
is happening it&#39;s side like you don&#39;t
chase the money you let the money chase
you you just do what you love and that&#39;s
what I did I mean let&#39;s go back in time
and imagine if I tell you guys that I
started playing video games to earn
money that&#39;s insane
because three days four days down the
line I would have been crying because I
kind can&#39;t find a single customer and if
I can&#39;t find a customer they there are
no sales no sales mean no money and
there goes my motivation because I&#39;m
taking money as my sole motivator and if
I don&#39;t see flowing in then there goes
my business right I&#39;m not motivated
enough then I would have given up so
follow your passion guys Felix who
doesn&#39;t know him he his channel on
YouTube has over 50 million subscribers
the most subscribed channel on YouTube
he made over 15 million dollars last
year not only that but but but the thing
is guys he did not achieve all of this
in a single day in a single night never
he started uploading his videos around
seven years ago
which is a long time and during that
time he was selling hot dogs he was
selling hot dogs to put food on his
table guys and if you ask me I would not
I would not start playing video games
because to earn money I mean like this
guy did so the question is why did this
guy do it it was his passion he wanted
to make people laugh and he succeeded in
in it pretty well so yes this is a
real-life example so if I am talking
about gaming and power of gaming money
and reppin or shape all this kind of
stuff guys we are living in an age where
where you have the power to leverage
from almost any kind of passion which
includes gaming so I really hope that
have two ends to your perspective today
thank you
