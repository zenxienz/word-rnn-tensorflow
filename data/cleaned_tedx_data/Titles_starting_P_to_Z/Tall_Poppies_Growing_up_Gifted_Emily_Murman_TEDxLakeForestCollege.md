my name is Emily Merman I love to read
watch eighties movies and put outfits
together I&#39;m currently studying writing
an art at Lake Forest College and I&#39;m a
seventeen year old senior did that throw
you off what kinds of words popped into
your head genius prodigy gifted I&#39;m not
doing this talk tonight to tell you
about my accomplishments though because
that may only fuel the misconception you
might already have of me tonight I&#39;m
going to talk about giftedness and the
stigma surrounding it because contrary
to popular belief gifted people aren&#39;t
good at everything and I faced many
struggles upto beginning college at age
15 I was speaking in three word
sentences before I could walk
by 18 months I know all the letters of
the alphabet and their sounds and by age
3 I&#39;d taught myself to read spending
most of my time at the library
I checked out about 60 to 80 books a
week and I remember beating my record
with 92 books this is one of my earliest
memories I was for one day when I was 5
a stranger approached my mom in the
library and said you have a super bright
on your hands I have one too that day
the gates to the world of giftedness
opened this woman invited my mom to a
meeting in a tiny living room in
Evanston where parents of gifted
children got together and talked about
everything that comes with that
what does come with that what does a
gifted child look like is it the kid in
all AP classes in high school maybe but
it may also be the top child who&#39;s
deemed the class clown with no future
giftedness doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a
privileged straight-a student because
giftedness doesn&#39;t have a face a child&#39;s
cognitive ability can be measured with
an IQ test and I accuse our fluid often
changing as we age so one score
shouldn&#39;t be used as measure of lifelong
ability mine has been measured
three times a majority of the population
places between 110 and 120 giftedness
begins to be measured at 130 I place
around 160 falling into the 99.9% I&#39;ll
where people score at least three
standard deviations above the norm now
you may be asking well why does IQ even
need to be measured who cares
well IQ is used to determine the child&#39;s
potential just as we may measure the IQ
of somebody on the lower end of the
spectrum to see his or her abilities we
do the same for somebody who&#39;s gifted
like any family member having having a
member with special needs mine was
turned upside down my mom sat in that
meeting and cried finally feeling like
she was with people who understood what
she was going through nobody there was
going to assume she shoved educational
material down my throat or that her
child was a freak no one there was going
to judge her sure that the pace of
public school would be too slow my mom
closed her business to devote herself to
homeschooling are you wondering what
that looks like that is the completely
different talk all I can say is that
homeschooling looked like freedom our
home school was even named free and had
the homemade slogan at home to grow our
minds to this day I still think of my
home school days as the happiest time of
my life often self-studying I had time
to delve into certain subjects as deep
as I wanted to and I got to go field
trips to museums Chicago neighborhoods
writing workshops and nature preserves
HSTs an Evanston co-op soon became part
of our lives meetings and get-togethers
and classes for gifted children in soup
h s GS gave me an amazing perspective on
real world diversity there were members
of all ages races socio-economic groups
religions and we were all exposed to
topics such as botany ancient American
history and Shakespeare I was with a
group of children all falling somewhere
on the gift a spectrum and all willing
to learn
however math still said as the bane of
my existence
I worked through workbooks and
flashcards and I still didn&#39;t know any
of my math facts so when I began crying
every time we had to do math homework my
mom realized that maybe a public school
teacher might deliver the information a
little bit better so at age five I was
sent to part-time elementary school for
first grade math that was a disaster I
was five reading and comprehending about
sixth grade material but I couldn&#39;t add
teachers told my mom she wasn&#39;t doing
her job saying things like maybe she
isn&#39;t as smart as you think she is smart
what does that word even mean smart
doesn&#39;t equal gifted and gifted
certainly doesn&#39;t equal good grades
gifted does equal learning disabilities
and asynchronous development this is
called 2e which stands for twice
exceptional in first grade I realized I
was not like the other kids I corrected
a teacher on a field trip because she
thought the okapi was related to the
zebra not the giraffe she yelled at me
for going to the fifth grade side of the
library where the higher level books
were saying I couldn&#39;t read them wasn&#39;t
allowed to and that my parents would get
a call home because I was being
disobedient so as early as five years
old I was already feeling threatened and
shamed for being myself now this was
really traumatising but looking back I
can imagine how a typical I seemed once
on the playground I was going super slow
on the monkey bars and the kids asked
why to which I responded I&#39;m being a
sloth none of them knew what a sloth was
so they just laughed and said I was
making it up I was with children but I
was alone that&#39;s the reality of
giftedness in a neurotypical setting my
mom read books on grade level learning
expectations because the original plan
was to send me to high school at age 14
like anybody else these books proved
useless
I&#39;ve read and retained a lot of the
information already I was like a walking
encyclopedia set - the math volume of
course around this time my IQ was tested
again I scored in the 99.9% I&#39;ll still
but I presented with ADHD a severe math
learning disability
and executive functioning problems my
mom really didn&#39;t know where I was at so
I took the a CT Explorer test at age
eight to see what I could do I scored in
high school levels for science reading
writing and history but fourth grade for
math so wasn&#39;t I supposed to be put in
the gifted classroom or the special
needs classroom the district said the
gifted classroom but that really wasn&#39;t
going to suit my creative or academic
needs
nor was it going to help me in math
maybe if I had been put in a
special-needs classroom I would have
been better at math sooner understand
that gifted kids are more than
standardized test scores and many can be
found in special education classrooms
although they may not be academically
successful their giftedness may show up
in their leadership creative psychomotor
or physical abilities my mom advocated
harder at the district they ended up
paying for my online high school classes
so my fourth grade year consisted of
online high school self-study french
tutoring art and math at the public
school I was too busy for HS GS now
teachers challenged me saying if I were
truly gifted I&#39;d be able to do
everything easily even after learning
that my math issues were related to
Gerstmann syndrome a cognitive
impairment that affects my understanding
of the rules of calculation they
couldn&#39;t believe that gifted people
could have learning disabilities in fact
the higher the IQ the higher the chance
of having one by the time middle school
rolled around my schedule was
frustrating and online school was
isolating I&#39;d run out of options so at
age 12 my parents and I decided to send
me to full-time public high school I&#39;d
graduated eighth grade by Illinois
standards but the school didn&#39;t want me
there because I was 12 my mom faced a
lot of bias from the administration and
we almost had to involve a lawyer but
after several meetings with
superintendents and principals I finally
learned I&#39;d get to go to high school
just two days before the year started so
there I was a bright-eyed twelve year
old freshman complete with a bob baby
face and brace
on Halloween I walked in the class dress
up as Joan of Arc and everybody clapped
they thought I was cute
to this day my dad still has nightmares
about sending me to school that day but
sophomore year I turned 13 and I didn&#39;t
want to be cute anymore I didn&#39;t
understand what a two year age
difference meant I got used to annoying
questions like have you heard of Doogie
Howser or are you a genius I&#39;m not funny
but I started to formulate comebacks
once when a girl asked me if I was a
genius I said no I only play one on TV
she thought I was being serious I&#39;ve
been put on a pedestal that other people
put me on and I had no way off I hated
it I hated that everybody in the school
knew who I was I hated walking down the
hallway with people turning around just
to stare at me I hated being invited to
groups so people could use me for better
grades I was either a source of freakish
amusement or an academic asset and I
didn&#39;t feel like a whole person anymore
lonelier than ever I found refuge in my
true passions literature reading and art
even that got bad fun girl in high
school bullied me the entire time
often threatening to beat me up I came
into the art room once to find all of my
drawings in the trash with some buddies
leftover food pored over them for good
measure I knew exactly who it was
talking to the Dean didn&#39;t help talking
to my teachers didn&#39;t help I was 13
getting threatened by an
eighteen-year-old senior who told me to
just kill myself already that one day
I&#39;d grow up and be normal like everybody
else but I hadn&#39;t felt normal at any
point in my life
giftedness is a way of thinking a way of
being and I knew that was never going to
go away so what did I do
I fought back through art with poppies
once on Facebook I stumbled across a
gifted learners page and they had an
article about tall poppy syndrome which
is when somebody who is classified as
better than their peers is targeted
metaphorically the poppies big bright
head stands out in a field and they
targeted to be chopped down I
immediately recognize that this was me I
did a quick sketch and I wrote down all
of the times in my life I&#39;d felt this
way and I cried hard angry at being so
mistreated for so long but I persisted I
did my whole ap art
poppies and I got a perfect score of
five I became closer with teachers I met
my best friend I had graduated high
school in three years with 31 credits
and I even went to prom in my dress with
a big beautiful fu poppy on it I was
gonna go to college I&#39;m so excited I
thought I&#39;d finally be in a place where
mature open-minded people would accept
me for who I am and that I&#39;d finally
find my tribe but I was wrong
the first day of orientation my age was
leaked to about a third of the student
body I didn&#39;t want anybody knowing I was
15 but it was listed as a fun fact on
the Forester guides sheets about the
incoming freshmen a fun fact why
couldn&#39;t it be that I make the best
Halloween costumes or that I had a pet
octopus or that I love Star Wars it was
something as banal yet as complicated as
my age this made my freshman year a
living hell I spent my time boarding
classes and approached by random
sexually inappropriate guys I was in a
private college on several scholarships
and I was nothing more than as one boy
put it the genius star of a kiddie porno
part of me wanted to go to parties and
dates and talk about who I&#39;d vote for

but the reality was I had a 10:30 curfew
and needed my mom to drive me to school
every day friendless and uninterested i
spiraled into a deep depression I spent
all of my waking hours thinking about
how is gonna kill myself because you see
giftedness means being intense and
obsessive I even had nightmares about
people being okay with my death happy
that they could use my brain for
scientific research
the stigma and misconceptions I
facing for over ten years had planted
themselves deep into my subconscious but
I pulled myself up off of the ground
I started medication and therapy I&#39;m
still learning to love myself the way I
did as a kid and that it&#39;s okay to just
be me it&#39;s really hard for me to
recognize that people see me as
different because in my mind I&#39;m just
Emily no one&#39;s super special except to
my parents does this sound like another
teen sob story to you I mean we all have
problems
do I sound like a crybaby maybe are you
feeling sorry for me don&#39;t besides I&#39;m
going to venture to guess that you
aren&#39;t but that is what made my journey
so intense and that is why I feel like I
have to educate you on the importance of
recognition and inclusion of gifted
people I&#39;ll always be the girl that
works out useless information at parties
rambles on about things only I find
interesting or gets excited about it
dates to the library but that&#39;s just who
I am if you&#39;re wondering if a normal
educational path would have been better
for me I can tell you right now that it
would have crushed my soul in a few
weeks I&#39;m going to turn 18 and I&#39;m
really enjoying blending in more plus I
finally mastered the art of using a
calculator have I had some great
opportunities yes my Art&#39;s been
displayed in Union Station I&#39;ve been
published twice and I&#39;ve won a bunch of
awards so my life has consisted of good
and bad experiences just like all of
yours my hope for you tonight isn&#39;t to
feel bad for me or be impressed by me
that isn&#39;t why I came here or chose to
be vulnerable I want you to take away
the idea that giftedness is something
people don&#39;t get to choose but with
respect accommodations grits persistence
they can really offer the world their
talents my name is Emily Merman I have

an 11:00 o&#39;clock curfew now I&#39;m a
horrible driver
I&#39;m graduating with a double major I&#39;m
in 1% of the population and I don&#39;t fit
in I like to blast my music I have celeb
he crushes I roller skate every Friday
night and I&#39;m a tall poppy still looking
for my tribe one day you might see
another one growing and their heads
gonna be hanging really low smile at
them and should you see one growing
think twice before pulling out your
scissors thank you
[Applause]
