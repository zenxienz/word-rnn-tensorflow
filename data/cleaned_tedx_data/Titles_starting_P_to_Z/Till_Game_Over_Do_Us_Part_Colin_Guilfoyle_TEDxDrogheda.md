okay so as tough as it is the first
thing I have to do is confess I am a
bigamist and what&#39;s worse I have no clue
how many people I have married at this
point are most of their names but as a
way of explaining it so and how I still
get to keep the wedding ring I brought a
picture of some of the lovely ladies so
as you can see the lady in the top left
I rescued her from some pirates in the
Caribbean
the woman in the top right there well
she&#39;s obviously a stripper but she&#39;s a
foul mouth but great for an alibi if
you&#39;re boosting cars in San Andreas and
yeah that&#39;s me looking all gangster with
the sunglasses on but you might be
thinking okay well gaming isn&#39;t really
relevant does to say it&#39;s it&#39;s the realm
of the sixteen year olds in the bedroom
but it&#39;s kind of moved on and recently I
had the experience I was playing online
gaming I was playing hailed for exactly
and one of my team got shot and you know
score goes up and I just heard on the
mic I can&#39;t believe you shot me and then
on the other end of the mic I heard what
do you expect you&#39;re on the red team and
just at the bottom of the screen it just
said John has been sniped by John&#39;s name
so okay it&#39;s a family experience now but
um what I&#39;m here to talk about is mainly
and bear with me because it&#39;s a mouthful
massive multiplayer online role-playing
games or MMORPGs I don&#39;t know the
abbreviation is just as hard but these
are massive worlds where computer
players are playing in a world created
by them so it&#39;s as if you were watching
Lord of the Rings but every character in
Lord of the Rings is a game player at
home the mostly kind of well-known
example will be world of warcraft at its
peak it had 12 million subscribers and
another one would be Second Life now
Second Life is what actually brought
this topic into my head and it was quite
a while ago at this point back in 2008 a
man was divorced by his wife because she
found out he was in a relationship in
this make-believe world second life and
it was grounds for divorce and they are
there since divorced I will say I&#39;m not
going to show a picture but just google
it his character in game was a six foot
three
retired nightclub owner reality slightly
different but then again this was that&#39;s
second life um when I went to create the
talk I did expect it would all be trolls
catfishing you know all the bad stuff
you hear but what I actually found is
that online gaming and relationships and
gaming is a it&#39;s a two-fold element to
it and one that does also do its allows
people to be the same personally but not
with the same physical limitations
they&#39;d have an interface to face
interaction and the example I would give
is under Astaire and Bronwyn the I&#39;m
gonna say elf I still haven&#39;t figured it
out and but it Bronwyn was in trouble
our doings came along in game rescued
her character put in his character at
risk now Bronwyn who&#39;s Jane in real life
thought this was quite knowable got to
know him a little bit better through the
game saw his kind of they shared the
same kind of belief system and and
values they met up in real life and are
now married in real life so and I think
they were the second couple ever to meet
online and true gaming and do that so
there&#39;s two two edges to it but then I
wanted to get some facts and figures I
can&#39;t help it
coding and everything numbers wise so I
said I&#39;d ask some friends now I hate
social media but I put it out in social
media I figured if I get ten people it&#39;s
enough for a makeup commercial it&#39;s
enough for a TEDx talk but it went
actually what I called Colin viral and
we got 150 responses and what I asked
the first question I asked and it was a
mixture as well so there&#39;s gamers and
non-gamers it was across the board
there&#39;s definitely one answer in for my
mother I know about much but what I
asked was if you were to married or date
someone in a virtual world
would you consider cheating on your real
world significant other now 31 percent
said just flat yes
23 percent no and 30 percent said not as
long as the you know the other half
agreed which brought up a completely
different image in my head imagine that
conversation hung I&#39;d like to see other
people mainly elves
but it was it was just and yeah I&#39;ve
gotta get that out of my head
but you could be looking at me and
saying what&#39;s your con you&#39;re a game
developer you don&#39;t give it you don&#39;t
give a toss what happens in the real
world you&#39;re all about the virtual and
to some extent you&#39;d be probably right
but when you look at from our side of
things gamification in game design
that&#39;s what we do it&#39;s rewards it&#39;s
coaching people to follow a storyline by
incentivizing it and with gamification
one of the things that we do is
obviously we incentivize I know MMORPGs
have brought that into some of their
merit marriage systems so the one
instance there is a if you would want to
share clan ownership or management you
get married relatively ok there&#39;s
another one where you get special
unlockables that you can only get by
getting married what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s it
worse it&#39;s strange they even have
standard and deluxe wedding packages now
I saw no mention of Frank but I&#39;m not
sure whether that&#39;s just the thing to
come and even the Sims online if you
want to make a baby you make woohoo it
could be a lot easier to explain than
the birds and the bees I guess but this
gamification kind of goes on and it
coaches so the next question I asked was
well if it was incentivized would you
get married in the game and one in five
people changed their answer to the point
where now half the people would say yes
if it was incentivized in the game and
that takes it to a whole new realm what
I also found which I thought was at
least some comfort is that 90% of people
said having virtual sex of the game was
still no so it&#39;s a loveless marriage if
there is one the other thing was getting
married to of someone who&#39;s not your
preference so two straight blokes
getting married to get the unlockable
content is just as bad so there&#39;s no
marriages of convenience and going
forward and from from looking at that I
kind of thought right okay so gaming
allows us to be better or worse people
than we are in real life it allows us to
explore new worlds but at the end of the
day
we&#39;re still the same people we have the
same value system we have the same
real-world people at our sides that we
impact and have a effect on so those
decisions that we make have consequences
and I suppose from my perspective at
least I would suggest that if you&#39;re
down the local wizard in world of
warcraft or similar and jokes 93
approach is looking to take the
relationship to a next level maybe say
no but on the converse side if you&#39;re
single and you want to meet somebody who
shares the same value system as you you
could always go down to the wizard in
find a nice dwarf warrior that shares
your value system and you never know you
could be the next Bronwyn and under us
thank you very much
[Applause]
