we have drawing ever since I was a kid I
love listening to stories I have my
tablet I go there and I make up stories
to be from books and watching my name&#39;s
okay okay I should love watching those
stories and I have internet and I used
to watch cartoons as to watch videos and
I started professionally so people saw
the fact that I was drawing and making
art they was at home in order to make
this as living you need to go into a
good college you need to get into a good
college and you need to like study hard
and make sure that you get into a good
college
and I was like yeah cool why not click
doing all day seems like a paradise for
me so that&#39;s what I did I used to watch
youtube videos and I just I need
practice for all these entrance exams
and everything so after that an audience
standard I started illustrating force of
magazines and stuff I thought for the
couple of agencies in stuff later on and
so often I took arts and the general
response to be placated arts is like
even one case or worth somebody will
come and tell you
that&#39;s the basic general response well
and all my friends were taken arts at
that point who wanted to go into design
and arts colleges had gone into these
tuition classes and all and their
parents and sent them and all of them
used to go six seven hours a day and for
some reason that idea didn&#39;t resonate
well with me and when my parents took
them my parents told me that I&#39;d like
him joining some hard truss it will help
you I sand them down and told them look
here&#39;s his online course by Tyson to sue
me and Robert Gordo who would picture
artists and so they had this course of
online and I don&#39;t have hands might as
well just invest in this course because
I learn a lot more about out I don&#39;t
want to like know about how to crack an
entrance exam I don&#39;t know how to draw
it I want to learn how to express myself
with and simultaneously actually take
photos and post it on my Instagram and
gradually build up an audience on
Instagram and that&#39;s what I did and
basically up until 11 standard I used to
freelance with companies I made a couple
of months in Salford chubak I used to
work with the agencies and bought myself
a laptop with the money that I made to
free in a freelance and this all

happened 11:20 my it went by I practiced
they used to look at those online
courses I used to look at other or nine
courses you can youtube videos and stuff
and basically present by I gave all the
entrance exams and after given the
entrance exams I didn&#39;t get it I get in
getting into any college that I wanted
and they sent all the
and I was this abundance that point
everybody had told me like you won&#39;t
make it as an artist if you don&#39;t get
into a college if you don&#39;t get into
this college if you don&#39;t get into that
college and I was like when this is over
now I can&#39;t draw anymore
I most won&#39;t be able to make it as a
living and the more I thought about it I
had done fine up until that point just
by learning stuff online and and vaulted
with agency isn&#39;t stuff I knew how to
use Photoshop and stuff so I thought
well if no no college will accept me and
on myself and I&#39;d learn it I tried to
learn everything myself I work hard and
I hustle harder than everybody else and
make sure that I do that that&#39;s my
responsibility and I still try to make
it somehow so that&#39;s what I did I I
packed up all my stuff I left all the
college apps and I enrolled myself in a
local art program component called it&#39;s
in you know so I&#39;m doing a degree course
over there and they didn&#39;t even have an
entrance exam that&#39;s the best thing that
I like the bugs and I just went inside
and they were like okay you can start
now
so I did that and I&#39;ve been looking at
our thing videos I&#39;ve been practicing
really hard I work for about I used to
work for 17 hours a day my hand swelled
up and I couldn&#39;t draw for a bit
that was bad but then I had back pains
and so I tried to walk as hard as I
could and I made sketchbook in the
stations I posted all of this on
Instagram
I made these are some of my
illustrations I made paintings and I
make comics by whiskey turbulent as much
stuff as I can so this stomach if any of
you has said created birthdays you&#39;ll
often see some people just throwing
fully cakes for some reason which makes
no sense
people don&#39;t get eaten shouldn&#39;t these
seasoned electro n cakes all around they
take swords and stuff to cut cakes and
I&#39;m like that doesn&#39;t make any sense so
I made this comic it&#39;s a 15 page comic
you can read it online so you know about
its called hashtag Caitlyn&#39;s matter
there&#39;s a paste thing in the corner
going like this he likes matter if you
thought about the black lives matter
thing then so I make comics I made this
Z it&#39;s it&#39;s this thing that I wrote it
and I just posted it online for free so
most people were like hey this is three
months worth of work and you just posted
it online for free right why did you do
that so I was like I just like doing
this and I want people to see the work
that I did within two days vice the
creators project segment of vice did
this tiny article on me and that meant
the world
like I owe a lot to them and then then a
couple of months ago the good folks over
at Instagram official Instagram thing
contacted me and told me hey we&#39;d like
to feature you and if you would like it
then you can also be on a story segment
for 24 hours and you can make a pitch to
us about what you want your story to be
so I made a pitch to them I was
traveling I was in Delhi at the time I
was on an assignment so I made it
overnight and it sends a pitch over to
them that got accepted and I got
featured on the main Instagram page and
my story was out there and just before
the day before this Messi and Neymar
were promoting like like Barcelona on
their main page and then there&#39;s me so
that that was intense and that means the
world to be so it boils down to the fact
that what is the model of this like what
is the point of this talk then what is
the point that I&#39;m trying to make when
we see so many people less privileged
than us hustling hard and working hard
you see there is we stop people over how
there are people who have just a little
bit of a monster
so we see so many people hustling hard
around us and that inspires me to the
fullest because these people are a
product of their circumstances it&#39;s not
that they wanted to be this but still
they show up for work every day they
work hard to you and they all have their
own problems and stuff and in spite of
that you see them working hard and that
really inspires on rod of the work that
I do and the fact that these days most
of us have like a smartphone or a tablet
or whatever and we can just actually
turn it and learn stuff on the internet
and so on you see available for free and
like it&#39;s good like of course we get
into a good college it&#39;s amazing and on
but there are so many people in it yeah
and like there&#39;s so much competition all
the time growing up in India you&#39;ve
heard this a billion times competition
is the competition is there competition
is there and when if you&#39;re learning
online you get to learn at your own pace
of course you have to make judgments
like if you like the stuff that you know
is based upon you you have to see that
whether or not you should apply to your
field or not but there&#39;s so much I will
do on like YouTube videos you can watch
food hockey learn Photoshop or whatever
in any creative field for that matter of
fact you can see you how to make do with
that field by looking at online videos
and the fact that some kid some rejected
from Pune has 28,000 people look at his
work every other day
[Applause]
I mean is the fact that anybody can do
it on the Internet and if you just
hustle hard on the internet you can make
do and that&#39;s the beautiful art of
husband
[Applause]
