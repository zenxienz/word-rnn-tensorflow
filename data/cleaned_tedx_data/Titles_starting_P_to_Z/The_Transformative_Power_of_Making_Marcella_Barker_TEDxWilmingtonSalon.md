can learning to make things help people
to lead better lives and become better
they&#39;re local and global communities I&#39;m
here to tell you that it can and I
witnessed these kinds of transformations
large and small every single day I&#39;m
part of an organization that operates
maker spaces maker spaces are open and
collaborative studios and workshops that
house all kinds of tools and equipment
necessary for the making of physical
things and the bringing of inventions to
life we provide training on these tools
designed for the total novice and people
of all skill levels and backgrounds come
to participate in addition to training
on these tools we provide support for
people who want to start small
businesses around their products and
ideas so we not only teach people to
make pretty much anything we help to
democratize entrepreneurship for people
who might not otherwise have access to
those opportunities Dale Dougherty gave
an excellent TED talk about how we are
all makers from birth it&#39;s really great
I encourage you to seek it out and watch
it because it&#39;s profound and I agree
with what he has to say I agree that
we&#39;re all creators and we all have a
creative instinct inside of us but what
I see is many of us have tucked that
creative instinct away after childhood
we often tuck it away when we tuck away
our Legos the emerging subculture known
as the maker movement seeks to rebuild
that connection it encourages people to
make tinker invent build even when they
have no formal education or training in
areas that are related like design or
engineering but I believe this goes
beyond a movement you don&#39;t have to be
part of this subculture I think this is
important for everyone to practice and I
think that learning to make things can
benefit you and your community in a way
that you didn&#39;t expect learning to make
things can change you fundamentally as a
person you may be familiar with the
research that shows our native language
shapes the ideas and concepts within our
society
in that same way I think the tools and
solutions that were exposed to and we&#39;re
familiarized with shape the
problem-solving that we&#39;re able to do
the solutions we can imagine I believe
that if you learn to make things you
will be feel more confident in your
capabilities you will be more innovative
and you will contribute in ways that you
never expected for many people this is a
radical and unexpected idea we&#39;re part
of a consumer culture and we&#39;re raised
to be adults that choose from a set of
pre-made solutions we purchase things
made by people that we will never meet
maybe under questionable circumstances
and of materials whose impact and
sustainability we just can&#39;t begin to
guess if you learn to make things I
promise it will not only teach you
things about yourself that you didn&#39;t
know you will gain a new awareness of
the wider world it will go far beyond
the walls of your workshop these are
some people I know that are doing
incredible things whether they&#39;re just
making a beautiful wooden bowl on a wood
lathe just to make it because it didn&#39;t
exist before to have something gorgeous
in their home or whether they&#39;re
developing a disruptive tactics
this young woman she&#39;s really
exceptional she has an excellent story I
love to tell it she was an athlete in
college and she suffered a concussion
and didn&#39;t realize it so she started a
company in which she&#39;s developing these
protective headgear devices with
embedded sensors that help people
realize if they might be you know
exposed to risk of having a concussion
some people are learning technology that
has helped them to solve a design
problem they&#39;ve been stewing over for
years others have learned how to use a
technology that helps them scale and
sell their art and they&#39;ve been able to
start a small business that supports
them around it no matter what they
doing doesn&#39;t have to be the most
amazing disruptive thing they&#39;re doing
something wonderful because they&#39;re
getting to experience the intangible
value of getting to say I made this this
is for me this is my creative
self-expression and that benefits them
and that benefits the people around them
the maker movement has been embraced by
early childhood educators it&#39;s a great
way of fostering childhood interest in
stem which is an acronym for science
technology engineering and math it&#39;s
really great at this because it&#39;s active
it&#39;s a really learning through play but
this is not just a movement for children
in fact adulthood and early adulthood
can be an excellent time to embrace this
new practice in this new way of thinking
maybe you&#39;re feeling disillusioned with
the utility of your expensive college
degree maybe you&#39;re more aware than ever
of the complex problems in the world
learning to make things can give you the
exact empowerment that you need to solve
problems in an active physical way you
are all problem solvers we are all
creators you may be a digital native but
the biggest problems you&#39;re gonna face
in your lifetime will require real
solutions in the physical world problems
that are resulting from things like
climate change so what I ask you to do
is join me in a grassroots movement join
me in this grassroots movement by
getting your hands dirty picking up a
hammer learning to make a gadget with
Arduino brings something new into the
world I ask you to do it because it&#39;s
gonna benefit you but we need your ideas
thank you
you
