okay so everybody knows this sound
especially people from the West of
Ireland and it&#39;s around us all the time
and it&#39;s kind of funny when you take the
image away from this sound it actually
gets a little bit more power you know
we&#39;re here in a theater but right now
you&#39;re actually picturing somewhere
different right
this feels feels different you know and
today I&#39;m going to talk to you about
kind of an aspect when creating Eric&#39;s
that&#39;s very very simple very simple but
it was also very very important and a
couple of years ago I was about to quit
music completely and get a real job and
I had just finished a major record label
album and it was about two years in the
making
and it was these kind of perfect pop
songs these like three-minute long pop
songs I had these really kind of catchy
choruses and it was perfect for radio
but it wasn&#39;t really doing that well
people were really picking up on it um
they weren&#39;t really connecting to it at
all and me personally worst of all I
didn&#39;t really like it at all you know I
was getting sick of playing it already
and it only just come out and I was
getting really frustrated by that and
usually when you&#39;re in an electronic
music producer it kind of works like
this let&#39;s say you want to put a snare
drum sound in a song okay you download
100 snare sounds from the internet and
then you go through them and then you
find one that you like and then you put
it into the song now
that doesn&#39;t really mean anything you&#39;re
kind of taking a sound because you think
it sounds right you think it sounds like
what this music should say I&#39;m what does
genres sound like and I was getting
really frustrated by this um and during
that same time when I was feeling really
frustrated I was helping my grandmother
clean at her house um and on her dresser
there was a CD and it was like a blank
little CD and it just had her name Mary
Keene just over it and I asked her what
it was and she said oh this is an
interview that I did with a lady who was
making a radio show she came to the
house and basically the radio show never
got made and she just sent me two CD
of the of the interview so I robbed the
CD of course and I took it with me and I
put it into my car and I started playing
the interview and I kind of starts like
this
well my name is Mary Keane I live in
Bell Ivana but I was real to kill
Shannon sleeving a brightly shining
about 1925 so now so this interview was
about two hours long
okay and in it she talks about growing
up in clear what it was like what her
family was like she goes off on some
pretty weird tangents and for instance
she does start talking about chickens
and chickens that can&#39;t lay eggs
once the wouldn&#39;t didn&#39;t there&#39;s two
Karam juegos
you might even lock in blue girls and
then have to get rid of that cop he was
no next year eighteen is gonna do a talk
chickens probably other things and so
then that was going on and then she
started talking about how she met her
husband he was my grandfather um and as
I was driving this came over on my
stereo then all the time when you&#39;d be
at home and your father and Debbie are
was looking for a good man field you
know of course I didn&#39;t ever expect to
get somewhere only somewhere I fell in
love and my father did come and my uncle
and it said marry this man over and
Karen has a brief affair of my land you
have to go over and meet so no I didn&#39;t
I make my future husband down and killed
for Nora and I feel in love oh shit
so there&#39;s a couple of reasons why this
is an absolutely incredible sample okay
number one okay it has an incredible
sense of place it feels really Irish you
know her accents the turn of phrase the
subject matter it all feels really Irish
number two it&#39;s full of emotion okay you
can hear this woman talking about the
person she fell in love with you can
hear the
in her voice it&#39;d be really hard to
recreate this with an actor or something
like that you know um and then third of
all it meant something to me it was
incredibly personal to me okay this is
my grandmother talking about how she met
my grandfather he can&#39;t really get much
more personal than that um I was just
blown away by it and I brought it home
and I started writing music with it and
I started creating these really hopeful
chords based on the kind of subject
matter and it basically turned into this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I didn&#39;t ever expect to get some Maroney
somewhere I feel acknowledged my father
didn&#39;t come and mile trip home
and it said marry this man Orange
[Music]
I
and I shall innovation
[Music]
[Music]
I should get some minority somewhere i
Freeland open and my father to come and
my we live call and he said marry this
man over in Chatham is a beach Maryland
[Music]
[Music]
so I remember so clearly the night that
this all came together all came together
in one row and it was only about like
three or four hours and it was just
suddenly there you know um it was
incredible to me because I just focused
on one single sample that meant
something to me personally and was
steeped in my culture and I had made
something that I was more proud of than
anything I&#39;ve made in about four years
of playing music it was just like a
Eureka moment like a I got a switch
going off and then three months later it
came out and it immediately started
getting a lot of traction online radio
stations started playing it all the time
and it went on Spotify and it shot up to
the top of the Spotify viral charts and
stayed there for six weeks
people were just really really in love
with it they could relate to it it was
it was it spoke to them on a kind of a
real Irish level and it was an
incredible moment and and most
importantly it was different okay so it
was a completely different thing nobody
else was creating this and no one else
could create that because it&#39;s so
personal you know and that for me is
like the Holy Grail when you&#39;re creating
art if you can create something that
nobody else can create that&#39;s how you
make incredible art and it&#39;s not a
massively new idea you know this has
been around for years as long as the art
has been around you know and you can see
it in certain kind of sections of art
more than you can see it in other ones
let&#39;s take a singer-songwriter okay so
singer signer it comes in and they have
this guitar that they&#39;ve had for years
and they pick it up and it has a big
story and then just before they start
their song they go this is a song about
and then they start talking about the
song that they&#39;re about to play and then
when they started playing people just
hang on every word you know they&#39;re
really really interested in the song and
they can relate to it another example
would be creative writing okay the first
rule that you get when you start
creative writing write about what you
know and that&#39;s exactly the exact same
I&#39;m kind of idea as the idea that I&#39;m
talking about here you&#39;re using your
culture your history who you are to
write something that&#39;s unique to you and
then you can start spreading it out to a
whole load of new avenues okay and let&#39;s
say you&#39;re painting a picture okay are
you painting a kind of a Vista or a
scenery scene are you painting an object
why are you painting it you know does
this relate to you somehow are you just
painting something because you think it
looks pretty it has to relate back to
you that&#39;s super super important you can
spread it back even further you know
what are the materials
you know even the canvas did you just
buy a canvas in a shop or are you
painting on something that relates to
the thing that you&#39;re creating I
guarantee you that if you&#39;re creating
something and you just keep questioning
why you&#39;re putting in all the elements
that you&#39;re putting in and you just keep
asking why am I doing this how does this
relate to me I guarantee you you&#39;ll
create something that nobody else can
create it&#39;s a really big moment you know
I&#39;m gonna leave you one more track and
this track is called falling for you is
from my latest EP um and it basically
shows you exactly what I like now um
let&#39;s go back to the see sample that we
had at the start okay so this see sample
was recorded in Bishop&#39;s quarters and
painted Claire it&#39;s where my parents
used to bring me when I was younger um
so it&#39;s kind of my first foray into the
West of Ireland I guess um and then I
was in Akal with a couple of my mates
last year and we were staying at a house
and there was his beautiful wind chimes
that were up on the side of the of the
house and that would be
I just lifted around and meaner than
malady okay when I was recording this EP
I really wanted to just soak myself in
the West of Ireland which is possible
didn&#39;t want to go into studios or
anything like that so I started renting
out houses all along the west coast and
building little media studios because I
wanted to just be in the moment and be
in the West of Ireland for me to get it
and in one of those houses
I was cooking and I managed to find a
jar with some rice in it you guessed it
that&#39;s this here so that&#39;s three
elements okay
of a song and already to me that really
sounds like the West of Ireland you know
to create the kind of an atmosphere and
you feel like you&#39;re in the West of
Ireland and that&#39;s three samples that I
did explain and then I wanted to get a
vocalist on this track so I I got my
good friend egg white and instead of
bringing her to a studio in Dublin like
we usually would I brought her to the
Zeleny Island and Carrie and we spent
about a week recording the vocals and
and Shea fell in love with the West of
Ireland she saw my love for him and
because the doc she wanted to make that
the
I guess the vocal kind of ideas you know
and fun denote sir because this was to
continue a thing we were trying to sound
like a West of Ireland she started
getting this like Irish live in her
voice which is really really unique and
even though she was still singing the
contemporary song
