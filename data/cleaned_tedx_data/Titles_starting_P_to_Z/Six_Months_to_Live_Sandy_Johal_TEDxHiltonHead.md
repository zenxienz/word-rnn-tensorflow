what if I was to tell you you are all
gonna die and you only have six months
to live and that&#39;s it what would you do
differently in your life well keep that
in mind and hopefully by the end of my
talk you&#39;ll have a different perspective
on your own existence now if I hadn&#39;t
gone through this I wouldn&#39;t be the
person I am today how many of you have
heard this statement or rather said the
statement some point in your life nobody
it&#39;s a pretty simple statement but it
tells you it a lot tells me a lot they
about you about your resilience power
and that you&#39;ve gone through something
very difficult and you&#39;ve transformed
yourself a notable psychologist once
said a notable psychologist once said we
aren&#39;t born with a fixed amount of
resilience it&#39;s a muscle we can all
build now what is resilience really it&#39;s
not for the very elite or they&#39;re very
talented it&#39;s a fundamental life coping
skill a fundamental life coping skill
you know adversity can hit at any point
in our lives a big wave a small wave
we&#39;re especially essentially powerless
to it we have no control when it&#39;s going
to hit
that&#39;s adversity it&#39;s a part of life now
how do you react when adversity hits you
do wallow complain whine why me my life
sucks a lot of us do that and it&#39;s okay
to feel those emotion but the point
being you have to stop it at some point
you have to put an end date to the
wallowing and that&#39;s how you get
stronger and that&#39;s how you build your
muscle power every time you do that you
bounce back quicker and that&#39;s resilient
now I can easily be that person that
sits around and wallows and complain
I&#39;ve had a lot of adversity my
but I choose not to I choose to define
myself as a person who&#39;s fueled fueled
with fortitude and I&#39;ll tell you why I
spent two years in a hospital room my
youngest daughter was diagnosed with a
rare pediatric cancer called
neuroblastoma she was only four months
old we went through the standard
protocol chemotherapy things were
looking good things were looking great
and this is her when we learned that
there was no evidence of disease we one
hair started growing in she started
getting life in her she was happy she
was a normal child sadly this doesn&#39;t
last very long three months after this
photo was taken it came back and it came
back in the form of leukemia acute
myeloid leukemia the worst cancer or
leukemia to treat especially as a
secondary cancer there are no words to
explain how you feel in this moment she
was given six months to live six months
now as a parent there are no words you
just have to accept it and you have to
move on and I had to make a choice I had
to make a choice to make every single
day of her life
beautiful and wonderful and magical
whether it meant transforming the
hospital room into a giant beach area
Minnie Mouse theme or Finding Nemo it
didn&#39;t matter whatever it took to bring
a smile to her face that&#39;s what we did
and that was the goal in-between the
needle pokes or transfusions and
chemotherapy and isolation it was the
goal was to make her smile and she was
so happy during those six months so
happy
but the nurses literally fought over who
got to take care of her literally
arm-wrestled my daughter unfortunately
passed away April 18 2012 nothing
prepares you for that you anticipate the
first breath but you never ever want to
see the last I was literally dead beyond
words I had I could not muster a
sentence a word I was lifeless I was
like a corpse walking around and he
didn&#39;t know how to pull myself out of
this but I just let myself feel it and
just kept going and then there came a
point where I realized you know death
felt so far away but yet it felt very
close now it was right in front of me
and that it could happen to me it could
happen to you and that we all are gonna
die that means things seemed very grim
but that&#39;s reality we&#39;re all gonna die
and we don&#39;t know when that&#39;s the only
thing so whether you have six months or
five years or fifty years or a hundred
years it&#39;s inevitable we&#39;re gonna die so
we decided I need to start living and I
need to revitalize myself and become
normal so I made the choice and I
realized well I can&#39;t be the person the
standee that I was before things have
changed for me I see life through a
different lens so for me I found that my
passion was writing and I wrote a book
and a screenplay but each of you you all
have something within you that you might
want to do but you&#39;re too scared to do
it the interesting interesting thing is
when you tell yourself you only have six
months to live it dispels all fear
because what do you have to lose you
only have six months you&#39;re gonna die
there&#39;s really there&#39;s no choice in the
matter and you don&#39;t care what other
of you you don&#39;t care there&#39;s a theory
there&#39;s no judgment you just do it and
it was a mind switch for me and I
started some passion projects as well
that and I just continued to keep going
and going and I love it and I&#39;m enjoying
it I don&#39;t need to read a book about how
to be happy actually everything that I
do makes me happy and here&#39;s an
interesting story about a man who the
New York Times wrote about extensively
he&#39;s also known as the man who forgot to
die now mr. Murat T&#39;s moved from Greece
to New York and one day was feeling a
little ill went to the doctor and they
told many in lung cancer and he only has
six months to live
mr. Murat T&#39;s decided I&#39;m not I&#39;m not
doing any other treatment I&#39;m going back
to Greece it&#39;s so much cheaper to have a
funeral over there I&#39;m moving back so he
moved back and he decided to do what he
loved
and that was Dardenne he loved growing
food consuming it and also making his
own wine that&#39;s all he did and he
enjoyed every single minute of it
here&#39;s an example of since of stuff that
he grew and ate they also socialized
every evening enjoyed it with his
friends well six months came mr. Murat
cheese didn&#39;t die nine months came
didn&#39;t die he lived for 40 more years
you really ate a lot and drank a lot so
the point being is that when you really
enjoy your life
it&#39;s amazing what how much happiness you
actually feel you actually forgot to die
literally now each one of you has
something within you and I know I said
that before but whether it&#39;s you want to
open it vineyard you want to be a
ballerina whatever it is start a passion
project you want to feed a hundred
hungry kids a month open an orphanage in
a third-world country whatever it is
there&#39;s something that they knew you
want to do and you need to do it
what are you waiting for time is of the
essence guys we&#39;re all gonna die I&#39;m
sorry to say that again but we&#39;re all
gonna die now what I see life like it&#39;s
like a Harley ride you jump on a Harley
we&#39;re super excited you&#39;re in a long
country road and hit a few bumps hit
some big bumps and potholes and you keep
on going smooth around a few things but
at the end of the journey you get off
and you&#39;re like wow that was fun that
was a thrill I loved it it was exciting
awesome I can&#39;t wait to do it again well
that&#39;s how I see life and I would love
if all of you could say that at the end
of your life
that wow that was so awesome can&#39;t wait
to do it again and if you don&#39;t want to
do it for yourself do it for the
generations below you your kids your
grandkids when you plant that seed that
plant keeps growing they look to you in
their life as a source of inspiration as
a source of motivation or when times get
tough they look to you as a mentor leave
that legacy for them
make an impact leave the legacy stop
being miserable and just do it just do
it
and lastly enjoy the ride thank you
[Applause]
