Millennials what do you hate most about
Millennials we all know the digs lazy
disloyal self-obsessed
and the big one entitled I&#39;m not gonna
argue with you about self-obsessed but
first let me get a selfie but I actually
think that millennial women are
game-changing Rockstar pioneers I have
dedicated my career to being their
biggest cheerleader
I was editor-in-chief of seventeen I
launched two other teen magazines before
that I have watched this generation grow
up and grow in to their own power and
potential I am basically the jane
goodall of millennials i have watched
them i&#39;ve observed them in their natural
habitat since 1997 still I can
understand how you&#39;d be annoyed it&#39;s not
all about them it&#39;s about you too about
a year ago I was giving a speech at a
millennial women&#39;s organization and
during the Q&amp;A session at the end a
woman stood up in the back of the room
she was in her mid 40s neatly dressed
for Saturday hair perfectly quaffed a
little silk scarf tied at her neck and
she said it seems like Millennials are
all that anyone can talk about these
days how does someone like me who is not
a millennial and who is not at the
beginning of her career not yet lost in
the conversation it&#39;s a question that
all of us is asked at some point in time
and probably not as nicely as that woman
in Rhode Island it can seem like
Millennials take up all the air in the
room
but the truth is I think that we should
all be more millennial and actually I
think that you are more millennial than
you think
flashback with me to 2007 that was the
year that I became editor-in-chief of
seventeen and it was the year of Lauren
Conrad everyone under 25 wanted to be
blonde and tan and drive their Mercedes
SUV through Southern California going
shopping and drinking giant frappuccinos
and it&#39;s not that young women weren&#39;t
ambitious
it&#39;s just that they assumed they&#39;d be
successful I mean after all the economy
was booming and affluence seemed easy
fast-forward a few years and we had a
terrible recession and suddenly we were
shopping in our closets and making our
cappuccinos at home and an entire
generation of young women just on the
verge of coming into their own had the
financial rug pulled out from under
their feet parents were laid off college
wasn&#39;t a sure thing jobs were nearly
impossible to find but rather than see
their horizons get smaller this
generation of young women was mobilized
they got internships in high school they
started businesses in college and they
voraciously reached out to women and
positions of power and influence for
tips on how to achieve and succeed
I could see it from where I was sitting
at 17 because suddenly I was bombarded
with messages for advice not fashion
advice not beauty advice business advice
I mean there was a terrible recession
when I got out of college too but my
generation Gen X we were the slackers
and we got mik jobs which were
low-paying jobs at McDonald&#39;s or coffee
shops to tide us over until the economy
right sided millennial women see work
differently and now that they&#39;re in
their 20s and 30s they are changing the
way work works for everyone
forever this always-on nature of social
media that they grew up with means that
they are demanding candor and
transparency in everything which feels
like TMI to you and I
but that transparency especially salary
transparency is going to get us all
closer to equal pay and this generation
of young women doesn&#39;t want to sit still
and wait to get promoted they don&#39;t want
to move up up up in a straight line they
want twists and turns and adventure and
when young women demand freedom from
face time in the office from endless
meetings that go nowhere from regular

hours of 9:00 to 5:00 or 9:00 to 6:00 or
9 to 9 that&#39;s getting us all closer to a
conversation about how work and life can
work together
and most importantly this generation has
replaced this old idea of competition
among women with collaboration there&#39;s
this dusty old idea that there&#39;s room at
the table for one woman and you had to
wait until that woman got up or fell
over or died to get her spots but now
that there&#39;s more room at the table
millennial women are making room and
bringing their friends along with them
they are devoted to helping each other
achieve and succeed this is their
sisterhood this is their squad there is
no doubt that work is changing for
everyone particularly for women and
Millennials are leading the way but I
will tell you a secret they&#39;re not that
different than you for the last couple
of years as I was researching my book
about millennial women I had a series of
dinners at my apartment
dinner is overstating it it was fancy
frozen pizza and many bottles of rose a
I don&#39;t cook
and I started every single dinner with
the same question if I could solve any
problem for you what would it be
and so dozens of desert dinners later
with hundreds of women around my table
you would think there would be hundreds
of answers to this question but the same
five things came up again and again how
do I find a career that feels like a
passion how do I get respect from my
bosses how will I find an equal partner
how will i balance work in children and
will all this struggle be worth it
sound familiar these are the same
challenges the same fears the same
anxieties that we had and so when you
say lazy I say Millennials are you
having a strategic deployment of
resources I mean why get up and walk
across town when you&#39;ve got TaskRabbit
and when you say disloyal I ask our
company&#39;s loyal to their employees
period
[Applause]
[Music]
and when you say entitled I say
absolutely they deserve everything and
so do we
you don&#39;t have to like them or the
changes that they are leading in our
culture in our work in our lives
but if you do not embrace these changes
you could be left behind but if we
follow their lead anything is possible
about three years ago when I was at 17 I
got a call to see my boss on the 42nd
floor of Hearst tower the carpets up
there are unbelievably soft
and the chairs are very very
uncomfortable and you know the meeting
it&#39;s not going to be a good one when the
head of Human Resources is already
sitting there and then my boss lowered
the boom in the face of declining
fortunes the magazine was being
restructured the staff would be slashed
in half and my contract was not going to
be renewed and in that moment I had two
crystal-clear thoughts this sucks and
two this is probably gonna be great for
me I mean to be honest I knew it was
coming the industry had been struggling
for years and so it hurt but it wasn&#39;t a
surprise and I&#39;ve been doing this job
for the better part of a decade and so I
was actually excited to see what else
was out there
but then something weird happened as I
was saying my goodbyes a woman a senior
editor at another magazine pulled me
aside to say how sorry she was and she
said this could have happened to any of
us
this could have happened to me I&#39;m just
trying to hang on for twenty more years
until I can retire
twenty more years this woman was my age
she had 20 years of her career behind
her and 20 years of her career ahead of
her when did we lose that feeling of
possibility when do we start to wind
down rather than feel excited about the
next adventure take it from Millennials
there is no hanging on
you can&#39;t lock yourself in your office
and hope that nobody ever asks you to
leave there are no offices anymore you
have to embrace the twists and turns and
adventure we all need a side hustle that
is going to keep us engaged and feeling
young and hungry and ambitious so we
never feel stuck I am living my life as
millennial as possible I am being
transparent about my wins and my losses
I am enjoying the freedom that comes
with setting my own schedule rather than
feeling terrified at the lack of a
traditional corporate structure and I am
relying on my sisterhood who have had my
back at every single twist and turn we
are all being asked to reinvent
ourselves for lives that are longer and
more unpredictable than we ever expected
and it makes sense to take our cue from
a generation that is reinventing how we
all work and live Millennials are
leading the way for us to have lives
that are richer and bigger and more
meaningful than ever before and that
rich big meaningful life isn&#39;t just for
them it&#39;s ours for the taking
I will give you the advice that I gave
to that woman that day in Providence
this moment of change is an opportunity
for every woman millennial or not to
make her life bigger rather than making
the force of change make you feel small
you have a choice
to be the architect of change or to let
change happen to you take the reins
thank you
[Applause]
