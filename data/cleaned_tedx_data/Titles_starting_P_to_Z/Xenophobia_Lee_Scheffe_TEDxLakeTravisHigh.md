I&#39;d like to start off today by asking
you all a question when is the last time
you or somebody you know has said
anything hurtful to anybody else based
off of your differences
no that&#39;s a loaded question I realize so
I&#39;ll make it easier for you I&#39;m gonna go
ahead and do you all a favor and expand
your vocabulary a little bit the word
xenophobia is a fancy sounding five
syllable for syllable word that has a
really simple impactful definition
xenophobia is the fear of people not
like you in fact and I will admit I&#39;m a
bit of a nerd for knowing this
xenophobia was dictionary coms word of
the year in 2016 so clearly this fear is
an extremely common one in today&#39;s
society particularly in the United
States so I&#39;ll ask the question one more
time when is the last time you or
somebody you know has said anything
xenophobic I&#39;d be willing to bet it&#39;s
pretty recent so what gives why are we
letting this problem leech out into our
society well there&#39;s a couple of reasons
first and foremost governments and
corporations benefit off of our natural
xenophobia by forcing minorities and
immigrants into careers and economic
classes that are nearly exclusive to
that type of person politicians can use
our natural discriminatory behavior to
boost popularity and rally support the
consideration of Arizona Senate bill
1070 is a perfect example of this
Arizona Senate bill 1070 is a bill that
requires police officers to determine
the immigration status of someone when
there is reasonable suspicion that
they&#39;re in the United States legally if
that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful so I&#39;ll break
it down for you
Arizona Senate bill 1070 is a bill that
requires police officers to discriminate
against minority populations based
solely off of their appearance but there
is a more direct reason to our natural
xenophobia it&#39;s in the phrase it&#39;s part
of our human nature unfortunately part
of what makes us human is being
xenophobic and there are real harms door
insolence we can look at takakura for an
example of this as I&#39;m sure some of you
know South Africa has a bit of a dark
past when it comes to xenophobia
unfortunately even with the ending of
apartheid in 1990
things haven&#39;t gotten perfect this is
especially evident when looking at the
South African immigration surge of 2001
a report released in 2001 depicts
beatings of detainees by guards assaults
by police officers and miss orderly
conduct towards refugees by Department
of Home Affairs officials guys we are
subjecting our South African brothers
and sisters to awful and unlawful abuse
in order to feed a destructive habit
that is previously split nations into
and inspired mass genocide so how do we
stop this how do we make a diff and DIF
those are the questions I ask myself
when preparing for this talk
unfortunately for us there is no global
code of ethics or law that prevents
neophobia from popping into our brains
all that exists are small groups like
this that hope to inspire change thus
the solution doesn&#39;t lie in mass change
but in individual change my goal today
is to get you to change the way you see
the world don&#39;t see the world through a
lens through the lens that society has
given you instead see it through a lens
of decency
don&#39;t stagnate and complacency with the
way that the world has decided to give
power to some groups and let others fall
behind but before I go any further I&#39;d
like to ground all of these big ideas
with a story when I was 10 I went off to
a friend&#39;s ranch to say for a couple of
weeks while I was there I heard an adult
use a derogatory term to describe the
Indian Reservation near the property not
knowing any better when I returned to
school the next week I used the term to
describe one of my friends not knowing
the true nature of the word I was
quickly informed of how hurtful I was
being when my friend let me know what
the word meant I think this is the first
time I ever realized how powerful words
can be see words have the power to
inflict psychic wounds and if we&#39;re not
careful with them then we may as well be
waving a sword around in the air
taunting people to come forward and take
a hit I would argue that words are the
basis for xenophobia as well as the
means for it to spread if I say
something hurtful not only am i
impacting the group of people that I&#39;m
targeting but I&#39;m also spreading the
plague of hate around me to those
unaware of their true verbal impact it&#39;s
because of this phenomenon that simply
rejecting xenophobia isn&#39;t enough even
if I succeed in my mission and convince
you that xenophobia is
and try to lead you away from your
natural discriminatory ways I can&#39;t ever
hope to create change until I create an
atmosphere of counter speech so what is
counter speech CR words spread and have
impact just like hateful ones if I can
convince you first to move away from
your xenophobia but second and more
importantly to stand up for the victims
of hate then and only then can i combat
the disease that is xenophobia now words
are not the only way to affect change
when it comes to this topic education is
equally as important and the quest to
stop racism sexism anti-semitism
homophobia Islamophobia and the like the
list goes on and on if we start teaching
more in-depth the atrocities and
contributions made against and by
minorities in our country then where you
can begin to have a deeper understanding
of the effects of our hateful status quo
and we can begin to inspire change at a
personal level it&#39;s an old saying that
demonstrates my point far better than I
can ever hope to write those who fail to
learn history are dooms repeated this
saying as cliche as it may be has real
impacts in fact it&#39;s happening right now
a study conducted in 1994 shows that
uneducated populations are significantly
more likely to commit atrocities and
they&#39;re against minorities in their
nation this chart shows something just
as revealing this chart shows that
uneducated populations are more likely
to respond favorably to the Taliban the
history and atrocities we are teaching
in our nation right now are already
making a difference so why not go
further we live in a society full of
hate subtle or not through both
educating our population on the effects
of xenophobia as well as using our words
to stand up for others we may finally
make a difference but before I leave you
I&#39;d like to give you all a word of
warning this change that I hope to
inspire will not come without fierce
opposition in our quest to stop
xenophobia we will undoubtedly face
people who defend their ideals and tell
you that it&#39;s not your way to tell them
how to think
you must never fall victim to this type
of thinking even excuse me remember
xenophobia causes tangible injury and
those who target thievery or murder are
never considered appropriate because
they hurt the group of people that they
target the same logic applies to
xenophobia you will also face people who
don&#39;t believe that their words can truly
hurt others
once again never fall victim to this
type of thinking even if somebody never
expresses their words targeted at
somebody remember they&#39;re still
spreading the plague of hate to those
around them I will not stand idly by and
watch my American brothers and sisters
fall victim to hate and I challenge you
to do the same stand up for people and
use your words to inspire change as well
as educate your peers on the effects
historically and present of our
xenophobia with these actions we can
truly inspire change and make the world
a better place thank you
[Applause]
