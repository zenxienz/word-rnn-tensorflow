hi everyone my name is Anakin and I am
an actor and I run a theater company I&#39;m
not a scientist and I&#39;m not a
psychologist I&#39;m Ally fist so I felt
really smug when I was writing this talk
I was like new term but I googled it and
actually Ally fist is a person who
remains and stands resilient in the face
of adversity seeks to answer their
calling to becoming the best and truest
version of themselves I mean it works so
it&#39;s fine so today I&#39;m gonna talk to you
about the power of no and make him
ejection work for you but I&#39;m gonna use
my life as a case study I&#39;m Ally fist
seven years ago I was 26 years old I&#39;m
sleeping on my dad sofa working in a
call center with people that I like but
I&#39;m doing a job that I hate and I&#39;m also
about to be voluntarily unemployed if
I&#39;m honest so I&#39;m actually a bit
depressed and I&#39;m in constant wonderment
about whether the thing that I&#39;ve wanted
to do in my whole life act is actually
the thing that I should be trying to do
with my life I&#39;m also about to be dumped
by this guy that I know I&#39;m not bothered
about obviously my first two powerful no
okay so the studies showed that there
are areas in the brain that are
activated when we experience rejection
that are saying to the areas are
activated when we experience physical
pain that&#39;s why when we&#39;re rejected it
hurts so much so I was I was pained so
back to this glamorous place of sleeping
without so firm rejection and
unemployment this is where I learned the
power of no my first play I wrote sing
in a call center hating my job and
little did I know then that that play
that I wrote on paper that I&#39;d borrowed
from the printer and I and you know
sitting behind a computer screen
pretending to answer customer service
emails little did I know that that was
the beginning of the journey that I was
about to go
- from creating my own work to starting
two companies to working for myself to
have an employees how do I get there
so back to sleeping on the sofa and
being dumped by X so don&#39;t touch me I
mean you can judge me it&#39;s fine whatever
but initially I I decided to start a
company and reduce my own play because I
thought if I did he change his mind so
it actually was a get a boy to want me
back then nice I cringe at the time my
best friend
she&#39;d been asking me for ages to start a
theatre company she asked me so many
times and my answer was always no no no
but hop skip to being dumped by boy and
getting a powerful no and I&#39;m like yes
babe babe yes let&#39;s start a company I&#39;ve
got a plan and I did have a plan
I had I get the X want me back plan
which I didn&#39;t say out loud obviously
but if we forget about the source of the
rejection for a moment if we forget
about that and we look closely you&#39;ll
see that it was because of the rejection
that I was able to motivate myself
without feeling that pain in my chest
that&#39;s what I needed strangely I needed
that no but in order to execute the
overriding plan get X back I needed to
actually make a path okay so the mission
to start a company and write a play
sure so at first I&#39;m going to check if X
wants me back no oh okay sure well I&#39;ve
got plans he&#39;ll see okay so start a
company right play sure a shift happened
you don&#39;t know it became quite powerful
this shift happened and that rejection
it it made me passionate and there&#39;s two
ways that we can use rejection right we
can either allow it to sit on our chest
of chest shoulders see on our shoulders
and weigh us down or we can shift it off
our shoulders and put it into our belly
and allow it to be that thing that Spurs
us on the only way that that no can be
powerful is if a shift happens now it&#39;s
not easy it&#39;s not easy tasks like I said
you know remember neurologically
rejection can feel like physical pain it
hurts in this industry that I&#39;m in and
that some of you about to walk into or
do you know even life in general we
receive so many knows we get more
rejection than we do the yes that we&#39;re
so desperately seeking at times is
something that we feel but we can use
that feeling and I felt it but the work
and the company suddenly became more
interesting to me than the initial plan
I didn&#39;t care about that anymore I
started to get really excited about what
I wanted my company to look like and who
would as have a people I wanted to work
with what places that I want my plays to
be on I stopped caring about that first
plan and this became the important plan
I started to do some research and I
wrote some lists right so the things on
the list
initially they started small like get
business cards create a website redraft
that play like physical pain we can&#39;t
ignore that feeling of rejection we feel
it right and we use it so in the same
way it goes from a severe pain into a
mild bruise then you can move on and you
make a plan I wash your plan what is it
don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about how achievable
you may think it&#39;s gonna be but what do
you want think about it
because everything starts with a plan so
I started my what I want to achieve plan
list and boy did I feel good when I
started to tick things off that list and
it&#39;s important to start small
I started small but small things they
turn into bigger things now at this
point the only thing I know how to do is
be me that&#39;s all I have I don&#39;t know how
to write a play I don&#39;t know how to
start a company but I do know how to be
me it&#39;s really funny because the thing
that ignited this that was rejected was
me but
all I have is me I was enough is the
same way you are enough I didn&#39;t have
any money I didn&#39;t know anyone I didn&#39;t
have any connections or any contacts I
was enough and this isn&#39;t to say that I
was what I needed no but it had to start
with me it couldn&#39;t have started without
me in the same way it can&#39;t start
without you you can do it whatever it
may be so I start to sit there and I
think about okay so what excites me
about me creatively what is unique about
me creatively who are the creatives
around me that can do the things that I
can&#39;t do a certain I really thought
about the answers to those questions and
then I play to my strengths so I know
how to dance and I like music and a bit
of sign language I know how to write
poetry well you know I&#39;ve sat and I&#39;ve
watched my brother and my older brother
produce music so I kind of knew how to
write to music cool I know how to make
friends and I had to be funny and I was
asked to write questions and I also know
that I can make up my own rules cool
so I decided on my motto which was never
give yourself a reason why not to do
something and you know what because it&#39;s
like a good day I&#39;m gonna give you that
you can have it take it there&#39;s my motto
- you never give yourself a reason why
not to do something I&#39;m not going to do
that because I don&#39;t have any money well
then work some extra hours I&#39;m not going
to do that because I&#39;m lacking a skill
okay then find a team I&#39;m not going to
do that because I don&#39;t know something
okay well do some research and ask some
questions I&#39;m not going to do that
because I don&#39;t know anyone well then go
forth and make some friends
it may have may feel awkward and it may
be a bit scary but never give yourself a
reason why not to do something cool so
I&#39;ve all of the above I&#39;ve got that I&#39;ve
put it in a pot I&#39;ve shook it up and I&#39;m
saying to myself okay let&#39;s start a
company
first step fundamental I think it&#39;s
really important to find someone to
learn from you know even when you become
skip skilled at the thing that you want
to do your experience there&#39;s still so
much to learn so my best friend and I we
start learning off a mentor of hers he&#39;s
a diver friend her friend&#39;s dad he&#39;s a
director and he says you know what you
guys just start an all-female theater
company I&#39;m gonna give you a play and
I&#39;ll direct you in this play and also
I&#39;m gonna give you the name of your
company
so we&#39;re fired up we&#39;re excited we put a
call out for you know women to audition
we hold auditions with our director
we&#39;ve got company of women yes we&#39;ve got
a play we&#39;ve got a plan we&#39;re ready to
go yes and we have a know our director
mentor he changes his mind no no I see I
can&#39;t help you no I&#39;m not going to
direct you in that plane no you can&#39;t
have the name anymore oh I see I was
reading and I and I know I read that
evolutionary psychologists they believe
that rejection served a vital part in
our evolutionary past they said that the
brain created triggers in our minds when
we were about to be ostracized so those
who had experienced real painful
rejection they had an evolutionary
advantage they saw the signals and they
were able to create corrects their
behavior so that they could stay within
a troop right so that&#39;s why when you use
rejection to motivate you time and time
again you can achieve things beyond your
imagination so my friend she&#39;s looking
at this rejection but at this point I&#39;m
starting to learn the power of no right
she&#39;s looking at she&#39;s like we don&#39;t
have a mentor we don&#39;t have a name and
so I take that no off our shoulders and
I put it in the fire that&#39;s already in
my belly and I say it&#39;s cool come over I
will just learn as we go
we&#39;ve got company girls now we&#39;ll call
ourself into star production and let&#39;s
keep it moving let&#39;s go
but I&#39;m saying to myself to note we need
to we need to create some sort of buzz
you know we&#39;re an unknown company
having a following why are people going
to pay to see us in a show let&#39;s create
a bus where do we want off work hon we
don&#39;t know anyone we need to infiltrate
these places I said to ourselves we need
to work hard first so at the time there
were two places I really really wanted
my work was oval house and Soho Theatre
these are the two places so I wrote it
down I&#39;ll give you that write down so my
friend and I we&#39;ve booked every play and
every event at these places we are
everywhere we&#39;re doing everything our
faces are everywhere we don&#39;t know how
to network but we&#39;re playing to our
strengths we&#39;re silly we&#39;re funny so
we&#39;re going inside these faces and wear
this silly double act right and people
laugh at us we&#39;re making all these
friends and at the tail end of every
single conversation we say to know what
bring this staff reductions we start
listening company should come see our
work and people started saying yes great
okay
let me draw upon those bits of paper
that I wrote in the call centre my first
play that became our buzz I created my
first play called conversations with
love
now conversations was this spoken word
dance drama that had music and sign
language in it about the different types
of conversations you could have with
love I didn&#39;t know how to write a play
but I knew how to write poetry
so spoken word I like dance I like music
I&#39;m learning sign let me throw all of
that in this is what is going to create
a buzz but it went from being this buzz
thing to be in the thing this is what
everyone wanted oh okay cool is only two
of us it&#39;s timing my friend but we&#39;ve
got this company of girls because we&#39;re
going to do this other play but
conversations is what everyone is
interested in we&#39;re going into oval
house we&#39;re performing extracts we&#39;re at
all these places so I park this first
idea and I
right all those girls into this play and
I keep it moving we&#39;re doing loads of
research we&#39;re making friends I really
remember Soho Theatre is my dream right
really will go Soho I said my plate or
Soho but on paper this it doesn&#39;t really
reads I mean it&#39;s a dance drama music
and sign language they read it and they
go okay thank you but no I watch okay
fine it&#39;s cool remember I can make
friends okay some research in I&#39;m
researching I&#39;m finding other places
that we can perform this play and I&#39;ve
made some friends in the industry and I
invite them along and one of them
happens to be a man who produces work
and events at Soho Theatre he sees the
show and he says you know what I&#39;d love
to produce this with you that&#39;s our idea
yes I did this in eight months I went
from this know this rejection to have an
accompany and a play that was being
performed it&#39;s so a theater in eight
months but it all started with a note so
I&#39;ve got limited amount of time so I&#39;m
going to fast forward through this story
and go forward a couple of years and
finished I was doing really well
actually we&#39;ve we&#39;re creating a nice
little following we&#39;re getting known in
the industry where I&#39;m trying to carve a
little bit of a way for myself I&#39;ve got
a new agent I&#39;m acting this is great but
doesn&#39;t sometimes we feel right and this
is when I started to learn about the two
different types of no so there is a no
that we receive that we can turn into
something powerful and then there&#39;s also
about learning the power of saying no
especially when you&#39;re in this industry
in your freelance when you&#39;re trying to
make away you just want to you
constantly feel like you have to always
say yes being a woman you always taught
that you have to say yes awesome anyway
but I&#39;m running this company with my
friends and I love my friend to death I
love this girl but running a company
with her was difficult for me somebody
doesn&#39;t feel right for me and that I
just don&#39;t want to do it anymore and it
didn&#39;t really make sense it didn&#39;t make
sense and not
want to do it because it was we were
gaining traction it was you know I was
making a name for myself our selves but
I just you know we&#39;re running it 50/50
for me it didn&#39;t feel like 50% effort
but she owned 50% are starting to resent
it Thomas not feeling right and this let
me just describe this isn&#39;t a reflection
of her as a person I love this is a
wonderful woman but it&#39;s a reflection of
our working relationship it wasn&#39;t
working for me so we&#39;re hitting a
crossroad I&#39;ve written I&#39;ve written our
second play we&#39;re starting to go down a
direction that I&#39;m really passionate
about mental health using drama for you
know community engagement um I&#39;ve got
loads of different ideas up here as to
where I want to go but I don&#39;t want to
run this company anymore with my friend
and she&#39;s leaving the country so I say
okay well if you&#39;re leaving I&#39;m gonna
obviously you know continue but with
these ideas so just just just let me
have it and she says I don&#39;t want to do
that yeah but you live in the country
and so just let me have it I don&#39;t want
to do that we&#39;re at this crossroads
because I don&#39;t I know the work that I
want to do and I know one I have a
company but I don&#39;t want to continue in
a partnership and she doesn&#39;t want to
let me have it
so I say no oh you can have it take it
I&#39;m gonna step down I&#39;m gonna have no
company I&#39;ll take with me you know my
plays and my ideas but you can have it I
said no okay so I&#39;m back to I&#39;ve got
nothing you know so now I need to make a
new plan I&#39;m gonna learn from the
rejection before those lessons those
trigger signs and I&#39;m going to correct
my behavior and move forward so what am
I going to do now at this point I&#39;m
writing a new plan and I saying to
myself okay I want a company that
business I know how to create work the
people want to come to see I know how to
create a buzz I know how to get you know
people interested in what we&#39;re doing
but I don&#39;t know how to generate money
from this company so that I can live off
it you know I I don&#39;t want to be one of
those actors or you know artistic
directors nothing against anyone else
but this is what I didn&#39;t want who is
acting but when they&#39;re not acting is
doing a job that they hate or has a
company but they still have another job
so I didn&#39;t want that I said to myself
this is what I want I want to be an
actor when I&#39;m not acting I wanna run my
company so how do I do that I need to
learn how to to run a business I need to
learn about business but I don&#39;t know
anything about business we don&#39;t have
any money to start a course I don&#39;t know
so I I&#39;m back to that metaphorical place
I&#39;ve been on my dad so far right but I
am still I&#39;m actually not on the safe
anymore but I am broke so I&#39;m at the
call center I&#39;m not the call center I&#39;m
at the Job Center I&#39;m signing on and I
remember there was one particular
memorable meeting at the Job Center
where they were making me feel a bit
like you know this lazy lobster Job
Center and what they do but this lazy
girl doesn&#39;t want to work and not
educated and I got all righteous and I
said no listen
and I&#39;m like metaphorically flipping
tables and I&#39;m like listen um I&#39;m an
actor I&#39;m educated I have a plan okay
now we&#39;ll start business and I&#39;m going
on this like low volume dran it&#39;s about
you need to respect me and my idea is
and as I finish that I&#39;m getting ready
to be like I&#39;m so sorry it&#39;s just stress
I&#39;m just trying to make it she says well
you should be on the enterprise
allowance and I&#39;m like what&#39;s that in my
plan I said I need to learn about
business I have no money to learn about
business and have no money to start a
business she says well the Enterprise
Allowance
is a scheme where if you&#39;re looking for
work but you want to start a business
you can get free business training so
you&#39;re still getting all the benefits
that you need but you get
all of his business training at your
fingertips for free and I had a business
mentor so for three or four months I was
learning about business for free the
business mentor that I was assigned to
you then is now on the board of my
company years later and at the end of it
I knew how to run a business to begin
with and I had a successful business
loan the information and the money
so in short that&#39;s how I went from being
oh my dad so for being dumped by a boy
so owning a business and having an
office and employees it all started from
oh no I was enough you are enough thank
you
[Applause]
