[Music]
good afternoon everybody
so first of all thank you so much to me
when you were introducing for this
generous introduction
when you are saying that I was actually
wondering is that me so thanks again
thanks so much once again way Wang good
afternoon to all of you so
sumir has already done the job of
introducing me I don&#39;t have anything
else to say
apart from the fact that I think I am
actually also a product of the city for
best years of my life I have spent in
Chandigarh and I think some of the best
memories of my life are actually from
Chandigarh so it&#39;s always a pleasure to
be back in the city and it&#39;s an honor
and a privilege for me to be a part of
this platform to be amongst this
gathering as a TED speaker thank you
again so much for getting me here and
for you know taking this time out for me
so coming to the topic the next tip me
and Samira are having a discussion
sometimes earlier this month in terms of
what would be a relevant theme for this
audience we kind of bouncing off ideas
back and forth back and forth
didn&#39;t quite settle on anything at the
same time my cousin brother who&#39;s
actually in I am Calcutta and he was
kind of preparing for his summer
internships it&#39;s starting from next
month sometimes so he reached out to me
he said by a car and I am I love
watching you come interviews make
irezumi melaku kya karna etcetera
etcetera he&#39;s also done as engineering
move from engineering to to MBA straight
away no experiences in between and that
kind of stuck a chord with me I said hey
I think that&#39;s a topic which can be
relevant for this audience all of you
will be going out to corporates in some
time from now in couple of years as
early as maybe next year what this thing
and you know there is I can that&#39;s where
I can share a lot of perspectives my own
perspective as I transitioned from a
student to a corporate or let&#39;s say no
my experiences over the last decade or
so having interacted with lot of
students having worked with them in
terms of as I made this transition I
thought that can be a good enough or an
interesting topic for me to share some
of those perspectives so that&#39;s where we
are the next step now before
we start before we get into it I
actually want to set certain ground
rules okay
I will last a lot of questions lots of
questions and I expect to get answers I
am NOT saying give me correct answers
just give me answers because I want to
understand that none of you guys are
sleeping okay over the call over the
course of college life one thing we
really learn the art is how to sleep
with eyes open I have done it myself
so I just want to ensure I am not
getting fooled that&#39;s why I&#39;ll ask
questions please give me answers that&#39;s
what I&#39;m asking
okay can I just have a quick show of
hands how many engineers sitting here
how many B&#39;s MBA students sitting here
how many other graduates sitting here
almost everybody okay good
so just one who I understand okay you
chose this particular career vocation
for your education vocation for you was
it on account of what it was your choice
it was your parents choice it was an
accident
you don&#39;t know
it was an accident okay no it doesn&#39;t
matter I trust I&#39;m being very honest it
doesn&#39;t matter because at that stage or
at that age stage of life what you do or
what you want to do is something it has
a very strong bearing of what let&#39;s say
the elders in the family have bases
their experience however as you go
forward okay as you go forward your
career choices will decide what you will
end up with that&#39;s when it&#39;s important
to understand what you really want to do
as you go forward so what next how many
of you thought through what next how
many of you want to be an entrepreneur
can all of you meet me out after this
talk you can be my potential future
employer so how many of you want to go
for further studies how many of you want
to go for a job good after further
studies how many want to do a job almost
everybody good so essentially as you
move when he let&#39;s say they were your
first job outside of camp outside of
college outside of campus your first job
you may find it to be very uncomfortable
the learning curves will be very steep
you are you may find yourself quite
unsettled because it involves change
there is a change right and when it with
change comes a lot of discomfort that&#39;s
why nobody likes change so let&#39;s
understand what causes this change or
why this change happens let&#39;s understand
that so what all things change when you
move from a campus to a corporate let&#39;s
do a quick exercise let&#39;s say just think
through what does a typical life in a
campus or what are the typical day in
campus looks like just think through you
know what is expected of you what you do
throughout the day just paint a picture
in your mind now try and paint a picture
of what let&#39;s say a corporate life would
be like what would you do throughout the
day what will you do in the day what are
the expectations from you you don&#39;t have
an experience but probably you know you
can visualize thinking looking at let&#39;s
say your elders in the family your
parents your in the siblings who are
actually working maybe your seniors
whatever you have read through just try
and paint a picture do both the pictures
match
they match excellent you already cracked
the port good does it match everybody no
it doesn&#39;t match so let&#39;s understand why
this mismatches let&#39;s spend some time
just to understand that maybe next
couple of minutes to understand that
piece I&#39;m not sure how many if you can
see the slide I&#39;ll just read it out so
essentially what&#39;s happening from pain
to learn you are actually moving from
being paid to perform right right now
you are actually paying to learn things
it&#39;s an investment you are making in
your education to learn stuff from there
you&#39;re moving to a place where you will
be paid to perform where somebody else
is making the investment in you to get
returns out right so that there&#39;s a
change in context with the context
changes same thing context changes
completely like for example let&#39;s let&#39;s
take things like okay time the concept
of time is extremely fluid you have to
submit an assignment by 15 September

even if you push it by 11:59 p.m. you
have made the deadline right you have

submitted on 15 September 11:59 it&#39;s
submitted you&#39;ll get a grading basis
whatever is the quality of assignment 9

o&#39;clock class 8:50 you get up somehow
scampered reach the class just make it
some more mock your attendance it&#39;s done
time is very fluid assignment due
tomorrow essentially translates to I
will do it tomorrow
that&#39;s that&#39;s time that&#39;s that&#39;s time is
that fluid however you move to a
corporate environment the fluidity goes
away I&#39;m not saying it completely
vanishes but there is more
accountability individual accountability
of the time of you know the deliverables
expected of you the much more
accountability which is there similarly
let&#39;s take say say group assignments or
teamwork how does it happen it&#39;s a group
there&#39;s a group assignment group of five
four people take that you know
distribute the work one takes a job of
collating all that work together so on
that you did everybody submits the
person just collates pushes it forward
sometimes you do that you dillion&#39;s of
checking whether the four people who
have submitted have this submitted what
they were supposed to submit have this
summit in the same font have they submit
the same slight background or is it some
multicolored slides going around some do
that some don&#39;t even do that your
diligence you know office set up or
office projects you
have to have larger accountability of
the individual deliverables you know
it&#39;s not just I have given my job I have
done my job and job is over till the
entire project is complete the
accountability still stays there so
deadlines missing deadlines is actually
not considered good and you have to work
with the same set of colleagues even if
you don&#39;t like them on the same project
classes I knows I don&#39;t like I&#39;ll form
some other group can you do that in
office you can&#39;t say that I don&#39;t want
to work with this Kelly you know I will
find some of the team that doesn&#39;t
happen similarly you know the reward for
results versus reward for hard work my
individual efforts decide where do I end
up in the class I put in 10 hours of
work probably get 80% marks anuses or in
assessments put in 15 ours I get 90%
marks or whatever it is you know it&#39;s a
linear gradation its consist dependent
on the amount of work that I am putting
in organizations not necessarily it&#39;s
not a linear correlation okay
I do not unilaterally control the
outcomes or the desired result that I
want because the dependencies are huge
number of stakeholders are many you have
put in more than hundred percent
probably still has not in the light of
the day because somewhere else the
dependency was there and didn&#39;t happen
so it&#39;s not a linear correlation which
happens which again is a slight
disconnect which happens similarly there
has to be a lot of focus on you know on
process control there has to be
consistency in the work ethic I can&#39;t be
doing a control C control V on
everything that I want
I can&#39;t be just you know Stepanek
through Google and pull out whatever
report which are available and putting
some political based presentation there
has to be much more you know a hands on
data based analysis has to happen and
that requires more consistent work ethic
so these are some of the subtle changes
which you see which happens as you as
you shift okay and these are things
which I have seen in my own experiences
where people kind of find that dissent
dissonance or disconnect as they come in
first couple of years when they come in
from college to campus so why do
companies even hire from campus when
they have to you know kind of help them
in all these things oh okay this
typically looks like a group project how
many of you can you resonate with this
why companies preferred to actually hire
college students we
the sheer energy what you guys bring to
the table the amount of energy the
amount of passion the fire and the belly
not acidity the fire and the belly that
you guys bring to the table the fresh
thinking which comes in the ability to
you know kind of challenge the status
quo question things because you seen
things from a very different perspective
you&#39;re asking why it is happening a
certain way why not a different way you
challenge the status quo you bring in a
different point of view this generation
is a complete disregard for hierarchy
and that&#39;s what actually organizations
want you are not a bigger person just by
virtue of the number of stripes you have
on the shoulder you are a bigger person
by virtue of what you bring to the table
comfort to technology organizations
they&#39;re all the business models are
getting disrupted on account of you know
the on account of the tick which is
intercepting in the lives that
comfortable technology is what is going
to be a key driver with the workforce
which is coming into jobs tomorrow so
let&#39;s take the simile of let&#39;s say a
traditional Indian marriage family
arranges for the boy and girl to meet
they get married girl comes to the
family what happens girls she has no
clue of what she&#39;s expected to do right
what does the right things to say what
are the right what is the right right
dresses to wear what are the right
scenarios to handle same thing family
has no clue as to you know what should
we impose on her what should we tell her
should we induct her into the you know
the ways of household from day one
later gradually understand both make
efforts towards each in terms of you
know building that bridge and that&#39;s how
they get into a symbiotic relationships
no different between the students who
are coming from the from the college and
the companies it&#39;s never a one-way
traffic it&#39;s not that only the students
have to make the efforts companies at
the same time in short that the young
blood which is coming into the
organizations they actually get inducted
properly they because you know they get
to understand the organization and this
so that they can start becoming
productive it&#39;s always a two-way traffic
and that&#39;s how this ecosystem kind of
exists so how can we fast-track this
understanding or how can you fast-track
the you know the settling into this
particular ecosystem these are some of
the I am not saying this is the final
list this is these these are purely my
perspectives basis my experience my
in the standing of you know working in
the industry for a decade most important
is get a mentor you should identify and
work a figure out a mentor for yourself
should not be a boss should be somebody
who is neutral to use a neutral
stakeholder has spent some time in the
organization to understand how does
organization functions okay
the mentor can really help you in kind
of navigating the organization
understanding the unspoken unsaid
commandments of that organization and
can you know and can really help you in
guiding through some of the complicated
situations as you kind of you know work
your way through the organization should
get a mentor definitely some most of the
organizations actually have structured a
mentor and mentorship programs which
happen if it&#39;s not there in the
organization which you are deciding to
join look for a mentor yourself you
don&#39;t call it a mentor call it whatever
but then purpose is the same stay
uncomfortable first five to seven years
of your career always try to keep moving
out of your comfort zone learning
happens maximum when you are on the edge
when you are in your comfort zone you
tend to become complacent you will stop
learning it&#39;s like how many of you
follow cricket or watch cricket very
less numbers I&#39;m surprised okay okay
look at it let&#39;s say let&#39;s say let&#39;s
take a a one day match 5000 match the
first 10 overs has to be handled
differently or the power players have to
be handled differently than the next
middle overs and the last slow movers
right the strategy has to be different
think of your career next 3035 years
what you mean or if you want to work
that long whatever similar to that first
five five to seven years have to be
handled differently then the remaining
part of the life okay
first five seven years experiment as
much as you can try as many different
roles that you can try and get as many
learnings that you can that&#39;s what will
set the tone off you know how your rest
of the query is going to shape up okay
do whatever but dirty your hands never
do a superficial learning just let your
hands get into the depth of things
Alai is the value of it as you start
managing teams if the team the guy comes
to me and says ene over you can actually
tell him I let you do how I showed to
you how it is done so dirty your hands
never do things superficially and stay
out of the comfort zone what my first
boss actually was I was really lucky to
have a very good boss who actually who
helped me understand the value of
staying out of comfort zone
my first job out of campus I was you
know a rookie youngster full of energy
when first assignment I was handling was
actually managing or doing a lot of
workforce automations lot of manual
processes we were automating there so as
part of a regular one and ones that I
used to have in the first I think I in
the first third or fourth month he asked
me so you settled how we were doing
etcetera and all that so I told him that
I was i literally crypt that nobody
wants to listen to me
the IT team does not want to help me
with right vendors who can do the
automation or who can actually get this
automation done I have to sit and
literally write the whole code myself
the stakeholders who are gonna who will
be using the automation they are not
interested they&#39;re thinking that this
will end up you know they losing the
jobs and stuff they are not supporting
at all you know nobody is helping me out
I don&#39;t know what kind of messes and all
that it really crib like anything he
said don&#39;t worry just continue continue
to work on it give it time after another
five six months we had the same
conversation he said so how are you now
I said it&#39;s better much better the
product is the the the platform is in
place the teams have started cooperating
because they&#39;ve realized that how the
efficiency is increasing for them
they&#39;re able to manage their workloads
much better and stuff so it&#39;s better you
know we should be able to get this thing
up and running soon another couple of
months we said how are you I you settle
now fully I said absolutely on top of
the things the phase one has already
gone life it&#39;s really brought in these
many savings it set her to the
organization we are now working on the
prototype for the phase two completely
on top of things he says so you have
fully comfortable I said absolutely you
know I can get this whole thing running
in next 3 months itself
he said time to pack your bags you are
moving to your next assignment I said
why I am now right now when I think I
can really deliver you know I&#39;m really
comfortable I can get things done fast
you&#39;re saying move this doesn&#39;t matter
you said the process somebody else will
comment can get the same things done
equally time for you to move on to your
next assignment
I got parked into a place for long clash
were western coast of the country
chemical manufacturing built ten years
back one of the worst places that you
can be in the country but trust me the
bit the biggest learning skiff so we had
actually acquired a factory there I
moved in there as the head of HR for
that particular factory some of the best
learnings happened there but the same
cycle continued so my initial three four
assignments every time I became
comfortable I took up another thing I
took up another thing actually my boss
forced me to look up another thing that
really you know helped me is shaping my
career in terms of you put me in any
situation today it doesn&#39;t fluster me
anymore so it&#39;s that being on that edge
which really really helps you in
maximizing and learning so always try
and stay out of her comfort zone first
five to seven years of your life stay
fit stay fit mentally as well as
physically I am the I am NOT the right
example of actually stating this but I
learned the hard way first couple of
years of my life I completely neglected
my health as soon as I joined the
company I neglected my health I put in
extremely long arts trying to make a
mark trying to do you know all things to
you know which can really really say
that Wow
you know is a fabulous management really
that we uh that we hired but over a
period of time you will see that your
productivity will start coming down you
will get start getting mentally fatigued
much faster always take our time no
matter what take out time to you know
exercise meditate whatever but take out
time to focus on your physical and your
mental health okay have your bucket list
never lose sight of it have a bucket
list pasted on your workstation pasted
on your bedroom but have a bucket list
keep looking at that bucket list keep
revisiting it if you&#39;re thinking that
you&#39;re not able to take any item on that
bucket list
still paste it there it&#39;ll it&#39;ll make
you feel guilty it&#39;ll push you towards
doing it okay don&#39;t let work subsume
your entire life you have should have a
bucket list last one is something which
I would urge each of you to start
thinking about it as to what&#39;s your
personal brand
what does let&#39;s say okay if I take my
example what does brand mine of stands
for I go and ask this question to let&#39;s
say stake some stakeholders of mine I
don&#39;t get up if there&#39;s a man of who
it&#39;s something
for me to worry about I am okay or it&#39;s
okay if they if they have a different
perception of me then what I want or if
it&#39;s not what I expect it to be but at
least I know where the gap is what needs
to be done the moment it becomes mine of
who that&#39;s the time when you have to
start literally you know introspecting
what&#39;s your personal brand what did what
do you want it to be how do you position
it to your stakeholders that&#39;s the most
important part how do you really do the
positioning of your personal brand to
the stakeholders once you&#39;ve decided
that this is an organization I want to
spend time this is an organization I
want to kind of you know a makeup career
with start thinking about what&#39;s the
personal brand how do you do the
positioning of the brand so most
innovative ideas fail on account of
wrong positioning you own your career
your boss does not own your career your
company does not own your career you
decide the career choices that you make
you are and you need to be accountable
for those choices seek as much counsel
as you want but make the choice because
you will be living or the outcome of
that particular choice it&#39;s okay to
change jobs in the beginning there&#39;s
nope it&#39;s not a cardinal sin to say that
hey I left my first job in six months
it&#39;s fine you didn&#39;t like it that&#39;s
perfectly all right there&#39;s no issue in
that the HR guy who came to the college
did a fabulous job of selling making a
good sales which to you you have what
the sales which that&#39;s okay if you think
that&#39;s not what you associate with it&#39;s
fine to change nothing no issues with
that don&#39;t make that a habit not in the
initial parts of the career don&#39;t make
that a habit don&#39;t jump for money jump
for something you really want to enjoy
doing okay at least initial part of a
career pick up things that you really
want to do you want you enjoy doing it
money will start flowing in you do it
the other way around you will realize
the repercussions yourself get a macro
picture talk to as many as many big
people that you can there you will find
them to be extremely humble you&#39;ll get a
lot of perspectives lot of insight why
is it important to get a macro picture
I&#39;ll just decode this for you all of
these guys sitting standing and cribbing
and saying hey the line is not moving
line is not moving etcetera I&#39;m standing
Everlast peppiness line is not moving
everybody is focused on the here and now
somebody was standing if
behind it&#39;s a beetle really strip
somebody who&#39;s the standing grill fire
he said who started this line it&#39;s a
circle it will never move in the first
place it will never move you keep
standing the whole day it will never
move it&#39;s a circle it&#39;s actually moving
but you don&#39;t realize it so get a master
picture it helps you in participate in
putting into perspective where you are
headed what you&#39;re doing so as parting
thoughts okay I just want to share some
home truths visualize again let&#39;s say
take two glasses of boiling water put an
egg in one put a coffee bean in other
one gets cynically hardened other
injects the entire surroundings with its
aroma color you know flavor etc you
decide or you own your career choices
nobody does that for you you decide
which one you want to be okay it&#39;s good
to be ambitious you should be ambitious
there will be office issues there will
be office politics we live in real world
after all what is important is you as
you go through life as you handle these
issues as you work with employees as you
work with people you need to look at
that whether are you battling something
or do you look at us as if I am building
something you can you can do it either
ways what I think it&#39;s a really good
idea and it&#39;s a good perspective to look
at whatever you&#39;re doing as if you are
building it it can be building
relationships it can be building a new
process let life be a series of building
something you know building something
blocks thank you so much thank you for
your time really appreciate being here
