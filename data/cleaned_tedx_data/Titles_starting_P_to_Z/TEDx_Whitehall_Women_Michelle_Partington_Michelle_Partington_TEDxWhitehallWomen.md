so when I finished my third lift on this
year&#39;s Invictus games in the competition
I came off the platform and a news
presenter said to me so where do you
think you&#39;ve come so before I tell you
where I came if you don&#39;t already know
I&#39;m gonna tell you ring you right the
way back to where I came from originally
I&#39;ve not changed much how I thank you
thank you
so back in my childhood sadly wasn&#39;t the
greatest we went through some very
turbulent times there was a lot of
shouting there was a little bit of
violence and sadly throughout my time
growing up I experienced child sexual
abuse from a family friend and that went
on for about two or three years and I
never really socialized so I wasn&#39;t
around people didn&#39;t know how to
interact with people all I&#39;d known was
being at home in that environment so at
15 I&#39;m uh need to leave home leave the
situation I was in because I just
finished school at that point although I
did pass my exams I&#39;d literally sadly I
hadn&#39;t revised because I hadn&#39;t had the
space all the time or the safe place to
revise so I passed nine GCSEs only one
grade C but the fact that I passed more
considering I didn&#39;t revise I was quite
pleased with that but I thought well
what do I do with my life now because I
don&#39;t know who I am I don&#39;t know what
I&#39;m about I don&#39;t know what I like to do
what you know what I don&#39;t like to do
could really go anywhere with the exam
results that I had but I remember back
in when I was 13 we had a curious fair
that people have at schools and the RAF
were there and I always said I&#39;d love to
join but I didn&#39;t think I was good
enough and I didn&#39;t think I was clever
enough
so I got a job in which my head teacher
got me in a fishing tackle shop cooked
in maggots and look worms and things
like I think I&#39;m winking
but sadly and and they really really
smell if anyone&#39;s been near maggots and
say all the horrendous but that was my
first job and I spent a year or so doing
that and then because I was into drawing
etc I then went to a furniture shop to
draw furniture patterns which doesn&#39;t
sound great but to me it was better than
touching those things so I did that and
then somebody said to me why don&#39;t you
join the RAF and I said I&#39;m really not
clever enough they said yeah but for
some of the things you don&#39;t need
qualifications so I went to the
recruitment office and they basically
said you don&#39;t need a qualification to
be a medic we thought so I joined I left
home sadly all my belongings were there
and I really don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened
to him since so I basically join the RAF
with nothing apart from my good self so
I turns a very naive didn&#39;t know how to
communicate with people haven&#39;t had any
friends really so I was suddenly in this
environment where you&#39;re sharing a room
with 23 other people and you&#39;re having
to try and work together and communicate
and they&#39;re having a laugh and things
like that and I&#39;m feeling very
uncomfortable because I don&#39;t know how
to interact with these guys but I slowly
start to learn and throughout training I
realized that I had strengths where all
the people were struggling so because of
the discipline I had no problems with
outside because I&#39;ve kind of come from
that environment all the inspections
having to have everything neat and tidy
again I had no problems because when
you&#39;ve had to cut your back lawn with
scissors you learn how to make
everything perfect so again for me that
was no problem at all and I started to
excel and I was doing really well and I
thought you know what I&#39;m actually a
person in my own right now and people
are actually starting to like me and I&#39;m
doing quite well in what I&#39;m doing and
then the opportunity came up to train as
a paramedic and I thought well I shan&#39;t
I&#39;m Mike Levin off but I went for it
anyway
and I&#39;m glad to say I look so join this
is me I don&#39;t have them glasses anymore
thankfully alright this was me having
passed my paramedic training and I was
very proud to graduate with the rest of
the guys and I thought this is it
fantastic I went on a tour then with the
RAF regiment and you know they&#39;ve just
put in the news now the women can join
the RAF regiment and serve with them
yeah I did that in 2009 it&#39;s no news to
some of us so I was the first female to
go out and deploy to Afghanistan with
the RAF regiment the reserves have done
it many years ago but I was the first
one to trial it and it worked really
well
and that was the making of me because I
realized how strong that could be how
fit I was physically and actually how
strong I was getting mentally as well so
I was kind of starting to build my own
little bridge to actually reach other
people because I&#39;ve not been able to do
that before so this bridge is building
slowly but you can&#39;t do that on your own
you have to let people in sometimes
which which is what I knew I had to do
to them move forward after that tour my
boss said to me why don&#39;t you
commissioned become an officer in the
RAF I thought well I&#39;m not good enough
for that and these doubting nichols in
my mind saying you&#39;ve got no
qualifications you&#39;re not good enough
you&#39;ll never do it and you&#39;ll never make
it but I went through the training and I
worked hard but all the way through my
military career my failure or they&#39;re
not fairly cuz I don&#39;t cost anything as
failures I struggled with academics and
sport where I commissioned I got through
it and through the grit of my tea so now
I really was struggling at times I got
through it
I passed the cirrie exams just on the
bare minimum mark that we needed but I
passed them and I was so happy but then
things started to change and I ended up
having to be a paramedic going to
Afghanistan working on the front line so
my next tour then was in back of a
helicopter picking up bodies mangled
bodies picking up men women who was
in the forces but also picking up women
and children from the Afghans as well
and what you know all you&#39;re seeing is
these people and the last thing that you
see is staring into some of these dark
eyes as their life leaves you of another
life that we couldn&#39;t save I then
started to struggle a little bit I was
diagnosed with PTSD and I had to leave
the service everything basically hit
rock bottom and I my bridge was
crumbling again and I was looking down
you know if I was in the edge of that
bridge now that had crumbled I wanted to
drop off that bridge and I plan to take
my own life I was lower than you could
possibly go and the only thing that
stopped me from taking my own life
with my granddad at the time and it
would have broke his heart and if I
hadn&#39;t I&#39;ve had in my heart I always do
things for everybody else I&#39;d rather do
things for others and put myself first
and I&#39;m so pleased at that point I
didn&#39;t put myself first otherwise I
wouldn&#39;t be stood here now so I had to
leave the service which I did 23 years
of and I basically I was grieving for it
for a long time after I&#39;d suddenly
started to become well again it was hard
because this is something that I&#39;d
achieved this is this is something that
made me as a person I found myself in
the military and that was my family so
then have to realise that you&#39;ve come
out because the military your dream
career is then turned into your
nightmare is a bit of a struggle and I
can&#39;t cope with it but you know what the
people that I just mentioned that can
come and help you I offered in I put my
hand up because it makes a better leader
to say actually I&#39;m struggling than it
does to just jump off the edge because
people will follow you and jump off the
edge so put your hand look and say look
I&#39;m struggling because you&#39;ll find out
you&#39;re not on your own and other people
were struggling as well so you know get
them in and help them to build that
bridge for you you don&#39;t have to do
everything on your own
it&#39;s all about teamwork and building
stuff so I did that and you know it
doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;ve come in life
I didn&#39;t think I could achieve anything
but I&#39;ve got my paramedic training that
takes a lot of work I got my commission
that
takes a lot of work you can come from
nothing and you can come from the worst
nightmare and get on so I mentioned that
I&#39;m not very good at sport and never
have been all my life and I was always
one that came last and the last to be
picked and then Invictus said do you
wanna have a go so I said well I&#39;ve got
nothing to lose so I had ago and I
competed in powerlifting and in rowing I
thought I&#39;ll choose rowing because it&#39;s
a sit down job isn&#39;t it it was really
hard seriously hard and the powerlifting
but do you know why I came
middle of the road in rowing I didn&#39;t
come last for the first time ever in a
sporting activity and I came fifth in
the powerlifting but the guy said to me
he said so where do you think you came
and I said you know what I don&#39;t
actually care where I come yeah I don&#39;t
care
I hit a PB in every sport and I did it
and if I can do it anybody can do it so
believe in yourself
