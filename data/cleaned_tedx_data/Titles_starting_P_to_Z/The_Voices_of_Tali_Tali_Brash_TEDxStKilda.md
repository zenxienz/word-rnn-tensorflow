there&#39;s a word in Yiddish called
necklace it means joy and growing up in
the heart of the Jewish community in
Melbourne bringing joy to your family
and your community and your friends was
everything and in school I this word of
being analysis machine what I like to
call it I was school captain sports
captains later on the school musicals
all of it I was a novice machine hello

tell my tally darling don&#39;t focus so
much you know so many children today
they learn it and learn it you know in
their mind so fast I tell her darling
just relax you know just to take a
breath and you know what I think is the
most important I had a hard life I am a
survivor and I tell her enough you
family love you friends but most
important enough you sense you know
Thank You darlings
does anybody have a lolly anybody have a
lonely okay never mind
so growing out people who would have
seen me would have looked at me and
thought oh my god she&#39;s so talented and
she&#39;s so confident and well she can
dance and seeing an accident but what
they didn&#39;t know is that underneath all
of that was so much anxiety and
self-loathing and incessant thinking all
the time my mind was racing and striving
and running on this fear and adrenaline
and and so I went in the last 10 years
on this journey of coming to meet these
voices inside these pots and myself and
I thought when I met then I was like wow
there&#39;s some really mean ones and I
thought okay if there are some really
main ones and scared ones then surely
there&#39;s some ones there that maybe there
be it kinda so I went searching for
those and well well well lol hi

having a bit of a bad hair day that&#39;s
alright hi everybody god bless you thank

all to have a big thing after this all
right all right
the little meet you
so I went on this journey of creating
these characters in the search of coming
to understand the parts of the self from
ego the voices inside and what I came to
realize was that we are not the thoughts
in our head we are the awareness behind
it and sometimes meeting these parts of
yourself and coming to the truth of who
you are can be both confronting
challenging and empowering well tally
interesting for you to bring me here she
asks me oh how can I be a performer and
I say to her why don&#39;t you stop
performing in your life first and
foremost stop pretending that you are
broken stop pretending that you don&#39;t
have a wealth of knowledge inside of you
stop pretending that you don&#39;t have this
power within you stop pretending that
you don&#39;t have a voice I can&#39;t bear it
you can call me Esmeralda hi guys my
name is joy pinky I&#39;m one of the voices
of Tulley in yeah oh I&#39;m just so proud
of him like oh yeah Gilda

you know it&#39;s really big that you&#39;re
getting up on stage and you know
following your passion doing what you
love life yeah it&#39;s really important you
know and I just say to her like
no loss he&#39;s like a footy field here
life is like a football game you know
like sometimes hand pull it across no
handball it over yeah sometimes you go
for the mark you miss it it&#39;s alright
sometimes you line it up you go you kick
it and if it go yeah yeah you know I
just I&#39;m sorry patty that&#39;s why I say to

is really can be tough and you know the
most important thing is just you know I

I just I just have to say that I&#39;m yeah
the CEO I&#39;ve seen Kilda Football Club
seating arm just I&#39;m so psyched to be
here so thanks - yeah so a few years ago
I changed my name from Lysa Tully
brushed it&#39;s Holly brash in in this
search and this hope that maybe I could
find what was my voice and maybe there
was a way to not live from so much fear
but to live from love and what I found
is that there is a voice deep down
inside of all of us and whether you call
it God or whether you call it sauce or
intuition berries a voice inside that is
ever loving and kind and I&#39;m passionate
about helping create a world where more
people speak from that voice thank you
