at the age of 18 I dropped out of
university after one semester I realized
I didn&#39;t know what career path my
studies were leading towards so I quit I
didn&#39;t know where I was going from there
but I started working in a call center I
didn&#39;t have a plan but over the next
five years I managed to climb the
corporate ladder and by the age of 23 I
was working for the company named as
Australia&#39;s most attractive employer
managing improvement projects being paid
more than most graduates I was flying
the world business class and that
Richard Branson I had a car I had a nice
apartment I had a personal trainer I was
independent and going places I had
ticked all the boxes to becoming a
responsible and successful adults
I didn&#39;t realize this at the time but
that success was the beginning of my
quarter life crisis things unexpectedly
changed I came home from work one day
and all of a sudden I had this intense
feeling of nausea and I couldn&#39;t stand
the next thing I knew I was in hospital
my heart rhythms weren&#39;t aligned
I couldn&#39;t digest food and I was having
seizures and muscle spasms I spent the
next week in hospital with doctors
trying to figure out what was wrong with
me I went from being a fit and healthy
23 year old to being unable to walk to
the end of my driveway and I had to move
back in with my parents the doctors
weren&#39;t able to tell me exactly what was
wrong with me but they did say that I
showed symptoms of chronic fatigue
syndrome and what that really meant was
that at 23 I was living an unsustainable
life
all because I wanted to be successful
growing up I was taught that if I got a
good grade then I would get into good
universities that I would get a good job
that I would get married have kids
continue on the same career path and
then retire comfortably success was
defined as a linear pathway of stability
and security that was successful my
parents and what my parents saw as
success for me but in my case despite
having this great job with great perks I
questioned my value against others
because I didn&#39;t have a degree despite
having money I didn&#39;t feel rich despite
my achievements I didn&#39;t feel successful
I was allowing the approval of others to
define what success meant for me
and it turns out I wasn&#39;t the only one
feeling this way I am a millennial and
that means someone born roughly between
1980 and the year 2000 Millennials
report the highest levels of stress
compared with any other generation and
that stress is causing more and more
young people to experience what is now
being called a quarter life crisis so
what does that mean the University of
London
has defined a quarter life crisis as a
commitment or a set of commitments
within a life structure that is no
longer desired but is not yet perceived
as a realistic target of change now what
that means is that we want things to be
different but we&#39;re not sure if or how
we can move forward now I am sure you&#39;ve
heard the stereotypes Millennials are
the narcissistic entitled technology
obsessed youth of today but we don&#39;t
even have a high opinion of ourselves
with 36 percent of Millennials
considering themselves responsible and
23% of millenials considering themselves
hard-working yet interestingly we are
the most optimistic when it comes to our
careers we&#39;re not just soul searching
for our passion we are moving away from
this traditional linear pathway of
success we don&#39;t just want work-life
balance we want work-life integration we
want flexibility sustainability purpose
and intrinsic motivation we want to live
where our social interactions personal
wellness creative ambitions and careers
are intertwined to create a positive
impact but Millennials face a unique set
of challenges recently it was suggested
by a millionaire Tim gunner that
Millennials cannot afford to get on the
property market because we eat too much
avocado on toast and I&#39;ll admit I eat a
lot of avocado on toast and I also don&#39;t
own a house but really the odds are
against us we own 30% less than baby
boomers did it our wage property is at
an all-time high we have grown up in a
very unique set of political and
economic circumstances and not only that
but we are the most highly educated
generation ever and we&#39;re also the most
in debt our student loans in England
the average is 32,000 pounds yet in
today&#39;s economy and job market that no
longer guarantees us work or continuous
income let alone personal satisfaction
now let me put that in perspective for
you if I was a businessman and I came to
you with an offer to invest 32,000
pounds in my business with no guarantee
of return would you take it
probably not the old model of success
doesn&#39;t work for Millennials
if we change how we perceive success
then society will change with us in
previous generations success was about
fitting into predetermined roles so if
the increase of stress in Millennials is
being caused by a conflict between
wanting to shape an individual identity
but trying to fit into these
predetermined ideas of what success is
then a key factor in overcoming a
quarter life crisis is to start
redefining success this new model of
success starts with us letting go of
these preconceived norms in a shift
towards individuality so how do
Millennials make that shift a key factor
in Millennials moving towards this
individualized success model is reducing
unhealthy and unrealistic comparisons to
others for technology obsessed
Millennials that means becoming
emotionally aware of how we react to
social media in the age of baby boomers
if you went to your 10-year high school
reunion it was probably the first time
you&#39;d seen or heard of anyone in years
now you can follow everyone you&#39;ve ever
met their achievements and not just
people you&#39;ve met the entire world and
that has the potential to be empowering
and educational but it also has the
potential to have negative effects on us
it encourages an idea of a perfectionist
culture now if you are a millennial
consider how you portray yourself online
is it authentic an American psychologist
Carl Rogers theorized that our
personalities mean that every human
instinctually wants to realize their
full potential and this process is
called self-actualization and what that
means is that we have an idea of what
our real self is and what our ideal self
is people become fully
when the real self and the ideal self
are most closely aligned now the problem
with this online portrayal is that most
people are shifting towards a version of
their ideal selves and it can become
problematic because a we have to live up
to this idea that we&#39;ve portrayed online
and also we start comparing our real
self with someone else&#39;s ideal self when
I was ill did I post about my struggles
no because I was worried about how
people might perceive me so here&#39;s a
question if everyone betrayed an
authentic version of themselves on
social media would people still feel the
same pressures of comparison and this
leads me to arguably a more important
question that whether the problem lies
with a culture of perfectionism or with
our interpretation of the information
our Millennials taking responsibility
for how they&#39;re emotionally responding
to seeing certain posts if everyone is
portraying and ideal heightened versions
of themselves online then Millennials
are all contributing to the problem as
Millennials we are all responsible
having the awareness of how you portray
yourself online and how you respond
emotionally is empowering Millennials
need to be accountable and self-aware as
individuals and as a society if we&#39;re
going to encourage this move towards
individualized success and these
principles of comparison they don&#39;t just
apply to online recently I realized
something that it&#39;s become fashionable
to be busy I are out for coffee with my
friends and they&#39;ll ask me how I am and
I&#39;ll say yeah I&#39;m great I&#39;m really busy
since when did it become cool to be busy
busy doesn&#39;t equal successful and busy
doesn&#39;t equal productive so what I&#39;m
trying to say is that Millennials are a
yes generation and we&#39;re inclined to
take
more than we can realistically achieve
so if the aim is to move towards a more
individualized model of success then we
need to start valuing individual time if
you are a millennial allow yourself
permission to say no for me what works
is setting one single daily priority and
having the hierarchy of other tasks fall
around that priority time management and
prioritization needs to become an
intuitive part of how you live and work
if you want to feel a sense of
progression and achievement in this
movement towards individualized success
now I&#39;m gonna take you back to my story
briefly it&#39;s been five years now since I
quit my job and I moved to London to
become an actress in the process of my
recovery in the midst of my quarter life
crisis I realized I had a choice I
looked at my bosses and I saw the
extensive hours they were working and
that was it I realized I didn&#39;t want
that and this leads me to arguably the
most important step of overcoming my
quarter life crisis that realizing that
knowing what you don&#39;t want is sometimes
more important than knowing what you do
want I felt in many ways that I had
failed by quitting my job and taking on
a new career how do I justify the loss
of time what about that solid resume
that I&#39;d built up what about all those
skills that I no longer might not be
able to use the answer is you don&#39;t have
to justify it the investment of study
time or skill isn&#39;t lost by changing
your trajectory Millennials need to
shift away from the traditional linear
model of success
if studies are true that every two in
three Millennials want to move on from
their current career path by the year
2020 then we need to start championing a
culture towards trial and error now I&#39;m
not saying that every millennial should
quit their job move abroad and find a
new career path that is not going to
solve a quarter life crisis but what I
am saying is that Millennials have a
choice in fact we have a world of choice
the choice to change the circumstances
that leave us feeling stuck to turn risk
into reward Millennials have the
potential to change the traditional
ideas of success and it&#39;s already
happening we are not bound by a
blueprint we are not defined by our job
titles our education our relationships
or our wallets if you are a millennial
ask yourself what does risk mean to you
how far would you be willing to go
beyond your comfort zone to find an
individual idea of success how often do
you feel actively challenged because how
else do we discover our potential
defining success on your own terms is
not only about reducing comparisons and
valuing your time it&#39;s about developing
an optimistic and tolerant attitude
towards risk the willingness to explore
and the persistence beyond traditional
ideas of failure towards a greater sense
of authenticity and expressiveness for
my part I&#39;m pursuing a life agenda that
is anything but traditional I&#39;m a 27
year old actress living abroad I haven&#39;t
made it in Hollywood or the West End yet
and to sustain my lifestyle I teach
children and I&#39;ve started my own
business because being an actor doesn&#39;t
always pay the bills only 2%
actors are employed at any one time and
rejection is part of my weekly routine I
haven&#39;t decided if I&#39;ll marry or if I&#39;ll
ever want to marry I don&#39;t know where
I&#39;ll be in five years time it may be
somewhere completely different and I
haven&#39;t averted stress many would
consider that I&#39;ve chosen a life more
complicated and I&#39;ve asked myself are
the stresses of pursuing a traditional
model of success any different to the
stresses of pursuing an individual model
of success and the answer is probably
not but I have purpose and I feel happy
with where I am right now
what would it take for you to feel like
you&#39;re achieving your full potential how
can you develop self-awareness
acceptance and courage to allow yourself
permission to define success on your own
terms
do you have to go to university changing
your career path doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve
given up you don&#39;t have to be a slave to
routine it&#39;s a choice eat your avocado
on toast and yes you&#39;re gonna have to
work hard you&#39;re gonna have to work
really hard because learning what you
don&#39;t want and what you&#39;d want it takes
time but if you develop self-awareness
allow yourself time to grow and commit
to your choices without judgement then
you allow yourself creative autonomy
millennial success is about shaping
individual identity
