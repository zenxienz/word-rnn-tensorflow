well it started off with some good news
good news everyone really exciting news
coming from the Advanced Placement
computer science exam had its best year
ever we had a hundred and eleven
thousand students take that exam getting
into computer science up from just fifty
four thousand last year historical
growth record number of young women
getting into computer science taking
that exam and underrepresented minority
students getting into computer science
as well in fact there&#39;s more young women
taking that apcs exam this year then all
exams from twenty thirty in the year
2013 a lot of organizations across the
country government academia private
sector nonprofit worked really hard
together to make this happen but sadly
we&#39;re not quite there yet we are still
about halfway where we should be amongst
all of the other STEM subjects we are
far far behind you can see physics
biology stat everything&#39;s still quite
popular and we got to catch up to where
they are today and the reason for that
is only about a quarter of American high
schools teach computer science and as it
turns out you know these are the first
at a Lovelace the very first computer
science and Mark Zuckerberg and as it
turns out the economy needs more more
software engineers and computer science
in the private sector in the public
sector national defense there&#39;s going to
be 1 million new computer science jobs
in the economy over the next eight years
and for every single filled computer
science and software engineer jobs that
are that are filled six to eight more
jobs gets created in the economy
depending on which study you read and it
is the number one ticket to the middle
class as the one I mentioned before the
computer science is now at the highest
paying undergraduate degree we just
overtook petroleum engineering a couple
years ago
it&#39;s life-changing for my family and our
family circumstances when my dad got his
graduate degree here in the early 90s
and DSU and that is a great tool for
economic justice for a lot of students
though so if even if there are free
reduced lunch their kids will not be on
free reduced lunch and in addition being
an economic engine our founding fathers
knew really really well what was really
important to a thriving democracy and
the number one ingredient for that is a
informed citizenry that&#39;s why the post
office is invented to distribute
newspapers not to send now Amazon
packages everywhere and today our
students need to understand the digital
world around them because they&#39;re gonna
be the ones that are voting voting for
four governors and Senators that are
going to be legislating these things and
change and how it changes shape our
society so when our students gonna read
about all of these things you know
technology wise in the newspaper they
need to have a high school level of
understanding of computer science so
they can actually participate in our
democracy and everything else that our
students are going to do will need
computer science their data probably not
gonna be a computer science for computer
scientists sake but they&#39;re gonna be
experts in other domains where they
actually need to have a background in
computer science I think for businesses
of tomorrow or even maybe a year from
now or already computer science and data
Sciences are is going to be just like
Excel our Excel is to businesses today
some jobs you&#39;re gonna go away like you
know like in the olden times elevator
operators you don&#39;t see those anymore
but a lot of other new jobs are gonna
create it and want to make sure our
students are equipped with those set of
skills so they can be successful
whatever career they end up in so for
example the Seattle Sounders are using
big data to figure out how to win how to
win and they just want an MLS Cup NASCAR
Formula one cars all have tons of
sensors on them generate terabytes of
data they can simulate races in
real-time manufacturing is going to be
incredibly different
has a shaving lab that puts a lot of
sensors and you they figure out the
angle and the force and they can design
a better set of blades not just adding
the eighth or ninth blade but adding
more figuring out how to how to you know
shave different parts of the body and
really also it&#39;s going to enable people
to see trends over time cease cause and
effect that people are just not very
good at seeing but computers can see and
it&#39;s gonna revolutionize manufacturing
toasters toasters are gonna be smart and
order its own replacement when I realize
something is wrong hot tubs your hot
tubs are gonna sense one the water is
getting a little bit funky and order
cleaning supplies or schedule a cleaning
because they have Internet of Things in
them Johnson control for example have
connected chillers that are telling
people it needs service instead of
waiting for an actual breakdown and you
do not want an HVAC breakdown in the
hospital middle of the day
same thing for agriculture precision
agriculture and agricultural technology
Internet of Things will monitor water
usage soil when rain you don&#39;t have to
drive around the farm and take soil
samples that means less water less
energy less wear and tear on machinery
reducing cost but also enabling the
farmers of tomorrow to increase
sustainability and yield and feed the
world and in finance law medicine
everything else neural networks AI will
sort of enable what people seen in Star
Trek will when they talk to the Star
Trek computer and it&#39;s gonna make people
do their jobs better and help them make
their better decisions with more and
more data it all sounds like science
fiction but we already have echoes in
our home and it&#39;s coming very very soon
and so we want to make sure in order for
our students to be able to be a part of
that economy be a part of that future
they have to have computer science in
their background computer science and
computational is foundational like
biology chemistry and physics whatever
they end up doing and whether you&#39;re in
Lee County Kentucky where you&#39;re in
Quincy Washington every student needs to
have the opportunity to learn
computer science so go volunteer don&#39;t
donate go invest in our kids and our
schools in computer science so they will
all have a future that they can not just
be a they can&#39;t be a part of an impart
help design and build thanks everybody
