hello hello again I am extremely excited
to talk about this thing called the
silicon road the silicon road the
concept is a bold new direction for us
as individuals not so much for us as a
state because our state has been there
before this isn&#39;t something new for
Rhode Island this talk is about how
innovation is deeply ingrained into the
DNA of our great state and what this
means is that we have to really reflect
upon and change the way we think about
how we&#39;re gonna bring about economic
sustainability and viability for our
citizens I like to frame this question
or this concept with a question what is
one thing that you know that you believe
deeply in your heart that 99 percent of
the people that you know don&#39;t believe
they&#39;re in complete disagreement with
that&#39;s a tough one but it is the very
definition of innovation and it&#39;s what&#39;s
propelled great societies from one level
to the next to the next for as long as
humanity has existed this is the
foundation of great ideas and when we
look at Rhode Island the ocean state as
they&#39;ve called it affectionately since
1972 it was created by the powers that
be at that time to help boost our
economic situation because we were
depleted there weren&#39;t many jobs and
things weren&#39;t going well but it was an
anchor that they had tossed overboard
even though that they are they had
already seen that the tide had already
gone back out to sea something like
someone like this right and
the innovation that&#39;s in our state began
with our founder Roger Williams he had
one of those ideas that 99% of people in
the colonies completely disagreed with
he wasn&#39;t welcome anywhere no one wanted
his ideas they wanted to execute him
from Massachusetts so what did he do he
founded his own state and that&#39;s what
great innovators do they don&#39;t ask for
permission they don&#39;t care who you are
if you&#39;re a gate keeper what authority
you have they simply make it happen and
he was a great innovator ingrained in
his DNA
shortly after Roger Williams we had
another M another innovator that came to
our country as an immigrant now this is
Samuel Slater he came from he was born
in Derbyshire England and I don&#39;t know
about you but soon as I read that he&#39;s
from the Shire I went online I started
looking up and googling and that&#39;s it ok
how tall is he is he four foot because
anyone who&#39;s born in the Shire has to be
a hobbit you know like the Lord of the
Rings or in his case the Lord of the
mills and when Samuel Slater came here
he connected with another great
innovator an independent thinker someone
whose counterintuitive from even his own
brother
this was Moses Brown and it&#39;s
interesting that they teamed up and
connected he and Moses Brown and he and
John Brown because they were both
divergent counterintuitive fingers and
slayed his mill this is what they built
right here in Pawtucket right this
sparked the birthplace of the American
industrial revolution for our entire
nation business began booming so much
that anyone who was able to work got a
job and unemployment was down at 0% even
if you were in grade school they were
going into 4th grade classes and
plucking kids out come on kid you got a
job like what do I do your fingers are
small they can fit in there
get the work right is there a cran in
there
yeah there&#39;s a cran in there keep keep
prodding and it really caused an
explosion of economic activity not only
for our state but for our entire nation
and before you knew it word began to get
out not just throughout the US but
around the globe and in masse people
began immigrating to the United States
it was the greatest wave of immigration
that the country had ever seen up into
that point and they came through Ellis
Island but they didn&#39;t stop there they
came to Rhode Island because they knew
that they this is where the jobs were
this is where it was hot this is where
it was happening and shortly after that
another type of individual began
immigrating and these were the educated
the elite the business minded the
entrepreneurs and most importantly the
innovators around the world began coming
here from all walks of life different
countries Rhode Island was the most
economically diverse place on the face
of the planet in that diversity the
different differentiation of thoughts
came together and they cascade and they
were like atoms colliding and they
created a new era of prosperity a
hundred years later from 1790 to 1890
another economic boom was created and
one that very few people know about
everyone knows about Samuel Slater I ask
it raise your hands you raised two of
them but people very few people know
about this that Providence became the
home of the five industrial wonders of
the world how many people knew that and
it was amazing because you had this
cataclysm of education which was being
spurred by Brown University Roger
Williams University and these other
schools meeting with these immigrants
coming from different nations and
Providence is so small
and geographically tight that as people
came together you couldn&#39;t go from your
house down the street without running
into another divergent thinker and it
just exploded and created the five
greatest companies at that time that the
world had ever seen that&#39;s pretty
amazing that Providence and this is an
actual thing you can google it this
isn&#39;t something that I just put up on a
slide check it out
we were home to the world&#39;s largest
precision tool maker and this company is
called brown and sharp they made
micrometer x&#39; and other precision
measurement instruments that were needed
to fuel the Industrial Revolution and
they could if you look at this picture
here there&#39;s a building here that was
their first one a year later they had to
build another one a year later another
one they were building buildings on top
of buildings and if they could have they
woulda started building buildings under
buildings the demand was simply off the
charts for their tools and their
instruments and after them next to them
we created the world&#39;s largest file
factory now ladies don&#39;t be jealous
these aren&#39;t the type of files that you
use when you go get your nails did these
are files that craftsmen and women used
to make for woodworking in metalworking
they were making doors and desks chairs
and horse-drawn carriages and they had
to they were artists and they had to
file the edges to make their product
smooth and graceful and elegant but the
world&#39;s largest file factory was right
here and it was the Nicholson file fact
file company after them we had the
world&#39;s largest steam engine company and
everyone knows the significance of the
steam engine and its impact on American
society but again the greatest steam
engine manufacturer was Corliss right
here in Providence and but wait there&#39;s
more there&#39;s another one the world&#39;s
largest silverware Factory right here in
Providence
they were producing they couldn&#39;t
produce so we&#39;re fast enough to keep up
with America&#39;s growing appetite and
you&#39;ve heard of the same people born
with a silver spoon in their mouths or
Providence that was probably no place
more likely in the world after them the
company that was going on manufacturing
the world&#39;s largest screw company when
you think of screws I look at the stage
in there all around me and they&#39;re
screws in your chairs and we don&#39;t even
think about screws in any special sense
they&#39;re commoditize item but at this
time they were the silicon chips of
their era and the American screw company
was a number one company in the world
that produced screws these companies
grew they exploded in growth jobs grew
the employment section of newspapers
were thicker than the news sections of
newspapers and those were all because of
the convergence of Education innovation
hard-working people that wanted to make
a better life for the light for
themselves and they created the five
industrial wonders of the world is one
more there&#39;s a bonus that often isn&#39;t
mentioned in this in this life but is
fruit of the Loom now no one&#39;s wearing
it today because well maybe I am
underoos but for the loom of Rhode
Island based company right here and
there are economic giants that propelled
the American Industrial Age to the
forefront of the world and put us on the
stage being a small state was not a
disadvantage it was an advantage you
didn&#39;t need to have five million people
in your city to be great all you needed
where some of the world&#39;s greatest
innovators people like yourself as I
look out at this audience I see every
race and ethnicity creed color
background gender orientation there were
people like you and that&#39;s really what
it&#39;s gonna take as we move forward
there&#39;s actually an interesting
statement if you look at the
the slide here three things that
Providence was one of the richest cities
in America in the 1900s that it was the
hub of the nation&#39;s greatest
industrialized state and look at this ah
something interesting they say that it
was considered to be an early day
Silicon Valley of cutting-edge
technology a lot of people think that
the first innovative Valley began in
California I beg to differ I think that
it began in a Blackstone Valley what do
you guys think this is Mike Stan popular
journalist and began in Rhode Island
made in Rhode Island innovated in Rhode
Island started in Rhode Island that was
the buzz that spread across the planet
if you want to know what&#39;s new what&#39;s
great what&#39;s amazing go to Rhode Island
that&#39;s where you&#39;ll find it so what
happened we lost our way we began to
think that tourism and maybe tennis was
gonna be the next great thing or sailing
I wish I had my cardigan over my
shoulders wrapped around here right we
built great mansions in the economy
tanked I have a saying movements
beginning caves and they die in castles
when we get comfortable we lose our way
[Applause]
so how are we going to repave our
silicon Road it begins where it began
with education and we have two great
book ends we have Brown University one
of the world&#39;s greatest research
organizations and then we have RISD one
of the greatest design organizations and
institutions and in between there we
have so many other great colleges and
universities that are primed and ready
to create that mix that we need to
really propel us into the future we&#39;ve
also done something interesting recently
that only one of four states have done
and that is we&#39;ve given away free
Community College to all of our citizens
[Applause]
and this is because of the leadership at
the top governor Raimondo Merrill orsa
and so many other of our elected
political officials have come together
to not compete or one-up one another but
governor Raimondo has done such an
amazing job to cs4 rrri in so many other
initiatives she&#39;s attracted top
technical organizations to our state but
she also believes that in governor I
hope you&#39;re okay with this
but there&#39;s also talent here in the
state that can create the next five
great industrial revolutions for not
just this country but for the world on
Monday of this past week there was a
groundbreaking and they were digging up
dirt in the old jewelry district and
burying it and Wexford science and
technology partnered with brown
University the Cambridge information
sent Innovation Center as well as
Johnson &amp; Johnson and a host of other
key partners to create a new Innovation
Center that is really going to serve as
the up
center of innovation for the state you
have Brown University education
Wexford Science and Technology Cambridge
Innovation Center innovation and
companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson and
people like yourselves that will go
there to contemplate what&#39;s the next
great thing for our state and there are
many other companies that are doing
great things
there&#39;s too much time to name them all
but some of them here we have emoney
intends on emoney is a newcomer to the
state Tenzin&#39;s been around for a while
and they&#39;re employing people in the
software development fields and there
are companies in organizations like CCRI
in Rhode Island College that are have
two-year programs that will help you get
started in that pathway to becoming
employed in gaining $80,000 a year jobs
after two years of employment these
schools are also working with high
schools so now high school students can
start taking classes while they&#39;re in
their junior and senior year and
graduate and then go straight into the
workforce like they were able to do
during the industrial revolution and
they don&#39;t have to stick their fingers
into little machines anymore other
companies like tech hire and general
assembly are working hard to train
people in 3-month cohorts to get people
into the software development field and
then there are a couple of companies at
the bottom that I&#39;m really I have our
warm space in my heart for and they are
intra-city geeks and career dudes
interested in geek same career devs are
two companies that I started alongside
Clifton Sean year and Rapala Stinky&#39;s
and without their help and our
partnerships from waterFire Providence
and oh I see of Rhode Island none of
these things that we&#39;re doing today
would be possible and here&#39;s a picture
of our class the current Korea Deb&#39;s
class standing on the deck of the water
fire building the water fire Art Center
and I want to talk about a cup of these
students briefly
one of the students Jose two months ago
I gave him a challenge I gave him a
Christmas gift in the middle of the
summer I said Jose this is a
remote-control car
here&#39;s a Raspberry Pi a fisheye camera
lens here&#39;s a link to Google&#39;s
tensorflow
and open CV open computer vision which
is machine learning artificial
intelligence programming I said I&#39;m
gonna give you one month to get this
thing to go around and around a track by
itself no hands look mom gives a new
meaning to three weeks we did a
demonstration he grabbed the car up and
the car went crazy it started attacking
everyone in the room we&#39;re all like
really run away run away and so Jose
left but then a few weeks later he sent
me a picture of video of him in the car
going around a track that he had
spray-painted onto his driveway at his
house in the car made it all the way
around by itself using artificial
intelligence that was like a moon
landing and it was a huge Jose was so
excited in the background I think I can
see his wife she was not really excited
looking at the driveway she was like I
don&#39;t know it&#39;s like now I knew she was
now I want you to program that thing to
clean that to track up by itself after
Jose there&#39;s another student named faith
faith started our class and from the
beginning she has a great job it&#39;s
really brilliant mine but computational
and algorithmic thinking wasn&#39;t her
strong suit and halfway through she was
kind of thinking I could see she was on
a fence about stepping out but as the
people in creatives all that you know
that it&#39;s like the Hotel California once
you check in we don&#39;t let you you out
and but something she just kept going at
it and sticking with it and something
clicked a few weeks ago like said last
week cliff ran a report to see who the
top performance in the class were and
she was in the top five and you can see
her posts on social media now she&#39;s
getting it she loves it she has a hunger
and a passion for it this wouldn&#39;t have
been possible
just five years ago it is today the next
person I want to talk about is cliff
he started out coming to code night with
the mare that I did with Mary Laura and
he was an average programmer back then
but something happened with him as well
and he is now a freak of nature I think
he has like an on and off switch a
microchip embedded in his brain
somewhere and last year Harvin had a
programming competition Harbor
University his team tied for first place
out of 639 teams
his team with only one of 11 that&#39;s high
soon after that a friend of mine she&#39;s a
former Google employee and she&#39;s here in
the audience today maram Ibrahim said
hey are now I have this idea for this
really cool social network based
location driven professional networking
application called common connect do you
know of anyone who can develop it cliff
and so cliff has created this amazing
new york-based app in its design right
here in Providence those are the type of
things you&#39;ll be hearing about common
connected in the weeks and days to come
and you&#39;re gonna say hey that app is
created here in Providence and so in
conclusion we&#39;re working in high schools
like Times Square STEM Academy we&#39;re
also in Time Square is doing amazing
things they were ranked the fifth best
school in the state this year and that&#39;s
a school that&#39;s predominantly students
of color low income and that&#39;s a
tremendous feat dr. Rudy Mosley is doing
an amazing job there next month we begin
working with Rogers High School in
Newport and we&#39;re so so excited about
that
maybe we&#39;ll get a boat and go boating
and do some coding on one of their
yachts down there but the silicon road
it&#39;s up to you to pave it it&#39;s up to
your innovative ideas don&#39;t follow the
herd dig deep because our mix is just
what we need just the thing we need to
create the primordial child chowder you
know they say the primordial soup in
Rhode Island we call
the primordial chowder and this silicon
road is going to be the birthplace of
the next five industrial revolutions for
the next hundred years
my name is arnelle Milhouse thank you
very much
[Applause]
