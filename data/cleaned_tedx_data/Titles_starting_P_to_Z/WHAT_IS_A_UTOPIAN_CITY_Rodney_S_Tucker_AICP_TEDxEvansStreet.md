what is urbanization urbanization is the
managed growth and development in
response to people there are several
elements associated with urbanization
the downtown sprawl and sprawl is the
outline residential developments they
rely on cars transportation low-impact
development and this is associated with
best management practice that deals with
stormwater during normal rain events
then you have urban design and
revitalization a revitalization consists
of downtown&#39;s neighborhoods corridors
small area plans but we&#39;re going to
focus on revitalization we&#39;re going to
look at alternative models for
neighborhood revitalization now
downtown&#39;s have reinvented themselves
over the years they&#39;re the places to
live eat work and shop they&#39;re the
attraction destination everyone on 1b
live in or near downtown and because of
the attractiveness everyone those
adjacent communities become the eye or
the target for revitalization now how
many you all probably remember musical
chairs you remember the excitement of
the chairs being circled up the music
playing and everybody really got into it
and nobody plays the game assuming
they&#39;re going to lose but eventually
that excitement mellows with
disappointment as each chair is removed
well unfortunately unintentionally
planning reviled reviled as a ssin for
neighborhoods or like musical chairs
when you announced the revitalization of
a community there are two camps one is
excited they&#39;re excited particular
cities two neighbors themselves the
residents themselves developers because
they get to see the removal of this
blight it boarded up houses
vacant lots filled with trash and the
promise of new homes new mixed income
development so typically the development
is done through hood the US Department
of Housing and Urban Development and a
number of CDBG funds which is Community
Development Block Grant funds home
investment program funds or utilized to
revitalize these areas and HUD has
teamed up with State Department of
Transportation to create Tiger and Tiger
stands for transportation investment
grant for economic recovery and what
they&#39;ve done is marry transportation
with housing and this is an effective
solution to deal with transportation
particularly the sprawl we just talked
about and there&#39;s been some amazing
projects in the downtown as a result of
Tiger funds but now let&#39;s reimagine a
different approach what if Hood teamed
up with the Department of Labor to
create lion labor investment
opportunities for neighborhoods the goal
is to promote internal revitalization by
having the people themselves rebuild
their communities taking job
construction training in Marinette
revitalization housing now they become
principal parts of their communities now
many of these communities have
double-digit unemployment now let&#39;s take
a moment here to reflect many of the
tairy a ssin of neighborhoods is the
fact that there&#39;s under and unemployment
that creates the deterioration of those
communities so we we see the drugs the
crime the breakdown of family values
chemical dependency those are just the
symptoms it&#39;s a mere fact they&#39;re not
working in fact dr. William which is
William Wilson with the Harvard
professor in his book and work
disappears he utilizes Chicago as his
case study to demonstrate the traumatic
unemployment in his impact on Syria
neighborhoods
that&#39;s precisely what&#39;s going on in
Chicago but Lyon has two phases the
first phase is creating a training
process for the residents to be involved
and ready to rebuild their communities
and I mean ready to rebuild and the
success of the program hinges on
community assets and what are those
assets they are faith-based and
community-based organizations technical
colleges local governments former and
retired
craftsmen the plumber the brick mason
the electrician etc now the success the
building blocks of that process is going
to be the faith-based community why
because these are people who are engaged
in the community who built that trust
who built those types of relationships
as can get residents involved signed up
and recruited and mentor them to stay in
the program another essential part of
that is the former plumbers brick Masons
because many of these people live in
those communities or similar communities
and there are a great assets that help
in mentoring those along because they
can identify with the trainees and the
trainees with them now that we got
groups working
we got them processing and working they
they&#39;re ready to go now we got to get
them working so how do we do that this
is where cities the federal state
governments can use tax incentives like
building permit reductions reduction in
business license to encourage them if
they hire these lion graduates to
rebuild those communities to have them
actively involved in the process and
this will encourage them and community
development organizations or they call
Chodos Community Housing Development
organization to build affordable units
for teachers the waiter who you enjoy
meeting at your favorite restaurants and
coffee shops now also the program is
designed also to get absentee landlords
property owners to not raise rents once
the units are rebuilt is also gets them
involved too if they hire these folks
that rehab these units for for sale or
for rent and the whole rents at a
reasonable level and cities in town just
like they do for downtown&#39;s
can provide tax incentives rebates and
grants and this is encourage them to
participate in the process incentives to
also get them to use and rent to own
programs give folks an opportunity to
rent while they build their savings
while they complete home own buyer
education repair their credits but also
local governments can play an
instrumental role in holding taxes and
pre revitalization levels because this
allows the seniors long-term residents
to stay in their homes and not be
disrupted or moves because of higher
taxes and this process and program is
not only just fits within housing but it
also addresses commercial revitalization
in repairing old buildings building new
ones because a neighborhood is just not
about people and houses it&#39;s about the
services that render to the community
and they support those services so you
have a holistic approach so what are the
benefits the benefit is it Bill&#39;s pride
community pride because the resident
built and rebuilt their communities now
many of us built things with our hands
and we don&#39;t care how much is not the
better the next guy but it&#39;s ours and
when you have that in steel you do
everything to protect it it means
something to you then also you have
employment skills and their employment
so they can take those skills portable
elsewhere once the project is over then
it provides an opportunity to sustain
affordable housing and there is
opportunities for a variety of housing
for mixed income but
cities win also because it increased the
tax base by having new homes revitalize
housing new customers from water and
sewer and now you breathe new life and
dying and dead commercial corridors but
more importantly you slow or there&#39;s no
justification ladies and gentlemen when
the music stops this time there won&#39;t be
as many missing people and chairs thank
you
