today we are talking about being
connected and when when the world
becomes connected through the internet
of things we let software look at our
cities we let software look at our
workplaces and into our living rooms
this software these algorithms they look
at data and they help us make better
decisions about how to work more
efficiently or how to stay healthy or
they can even make decisions for us or
about us imagine in a couple of years
everybody in your neighborhood
drives an electric car and one morning
everybody gets ready for that commute
and they go to their car and you and all
your neighbors find the car charged just
a fraction of what you need to make it
to work what happened well if everybody
wants to charge their car overnight the
power grid can&#39;t handle that charging a
car cost as much energy as five
households but the Internet of Things
can solve this we just have to create a
system that lets some people charge
first and others people later now
there&#39;s a problem who do we charge first
who do give priority and it wants to
wait their turn
well our system has to make a couple of
decisions I think we can all agree that
a doctor needs a charged car so we can
respond to emergencies right
so with a little bit of data about your
profession we can make sure the doctor
can make it to the next heart attack I
also think we want to make sure we all
make it to work tomorrow
so if we have a little bit of data from
new Google Maps or your TomTom we can
make sure you can make that commute you
see with a little bit more data you get
a better solution and life&#39;s not only
about work right we also want to make
sure you can make it on the next weekend
trip or to the dentist appointment so if
you give us some access to your calendar
we can have a little bit of data and
make sure you can make it to that brunch
on Sunday morning with a little bit more
data we get you a better solution and
today is your lucky day because our
algorithm our algorithm looked at your
purchase history of hemorrhoid cream and
found out that you&#39;re running low so we
charged your car a little bit extra so
you can make that detour to that
pharmacy downtown well suddenly you see
that the better solution is not okay
anymore
this solution not only relies on
sensitive data it&#39;s also a black box
that looks at data and gets to decide
who has mobility and who doesn&#39;t and one
day you find your car in the morning not
charged at all and you&#39;ll have no idea
why that happened was it because you
switch jobs or you got plenty of
hemorrhoid cream you don&#39;t know this is
not some thought experiment this is an
actual problem we&#39;re working on with
leading organizations in the indie
energy sector
now don&#39;t get me wrong the Internet of
Things or IOT for short is a great tool
it&#39;s a great tool to make our lives more
comfortable to make our work efficient I
also think the next speaker is gonna
give some really good examples but when
it&#39;s a tool is it a tool like a hammer a
tool everyone can handle if you miss the
nail it&#39;s just you that&#39;s hurt therefore
it&#39;s a tool that everybody can go into a
shop and buy
you see the thing with the Internet of
Things is that this hammer can in turn
into something bigger like a steamroller
a tool that is essential for
infrastructure but it can have drastic
consequences when used in the wrong way
so that&#39;s why only qualified
professionals can use it you may wonder
in your when you&#39;re developing an IOT
solution even though when you start with
the best intentions it can develop into
a steamroller
so how do you know when a hammer is
turning into a steamroller
in other words when am i developing
something useful for people and why when
do I develop a solution that&#39;s based on
unfair data practices this dilemma is
central to our work at our design studio
the incredible machine but it wasn&#39;t
always like this when we started our
studio in 2012 we work with dozens of
clients to transform their business
through the IOT and sometimes we work at
projects where collecting personal data
was more important than creating value
for people we have worked on these
projects that are black boxes that make
decisions based on data about users
about citizens about employees and every
time that would happen we wondered how
did this happen like when we start this
project we were excited about the
possibilities and when we look at the
final design we conjured up a
steamroller
we couldn&#39;t continue to help companies
create products and services that deemed
data more important than human values so
we
part of a problem but how could we part
of a solution
should we just dismiss the internet of
things just heavily restrict what
products can do what they can monitor
what they can communicate but
potentially miss out on many great
opportunities to make life&#39;s better or
even save lives or should we embrace
technological progress let it take its
course let it maybe it takes it it takes
a sacrifice of some of our values along
the way but I guess the recent influence
of propaganda on social media in the
recent US elections have shown us we
cannot afford not to stay critical about
technology I think we have to look for a
solution somewhere else
and I think it&#39;s a cultural problem the
problem is not about the products the
data the technology the problem lies
with the values that we embed in the
products that we as designers as
engineers as managers create so we have
to look at culture because if we want to
build an Internet of Things we can trust
we have to come together and decide
what&#39;s important what is not what is
right what is wrong we have to look at
FX we weren&#39;t the only one with this
realization in 2015 we gather with a
group of designers and researchers that
share our concerns this group said it
was time for action
actually it was time for words the IOT
design manifesto ten principles for
design in the connected world
it lists principles like we are
deliberate about what data we collect
about only using that specific data
that&#39;s used to make the product work we
make the parties associated with an IOT
product explain
it&#39;s about hundred percent transparency
about who has access to your data and
what they can do with it and it&#39;s not
only about transparency the principle we
empower users to be masters of their own
domain dictates that users have the
final control about what&#39;s theirs we
launched the IOT design manifesto at a
conference things come in 2015 in a
matter of weeks hundreds of
professionals scientists from thought
leaders in Silicon Valley two professors
from world-class universities from
designers in China in India to
innovation managers in the tech industry
it even became the basis of courses
about IOT at schools and universities
and IOT design manifesto became a tool
itself when you are developing an IOT
solution you can look at it and say am I
still making it a hammer or are we
creating a steamroller holding up the
documents in Berlin in 2015
changed my career projects changed
suddenly conversations with clients
developed I couldn&#39;t some clients we
couldn&#39;t align with anymore
and we pass on their projects and other
clients came to us to look to how to
develop a fair IOT solution and that
leads me back to a conversation I had
earlier this year a Research Institute
and an energy company asked us look the
future of electric vehicles is smart
charging charging based on data but when
we developed this smart charging we
might create a black box that gets to
decide who gets to drive the car and who
doesn&#39;t it took a while for us to
understand that question it was not they
weren&#39;t asking for a fare out
rhythm they were asking us to help them
change the culture in which smart
charging was being developed was being
imagined so we collaborated on an
example of the first smart charging
station that was not a black box that
was transparent this smart charging
station would show exactly what data I
would use to make a planning exactly
what decisions it would make and allow a
user to scrutinize the algorithm and if
they wouldn&#39;t consider it fair they
would have leverage over the energy
company it is just an example but it
helps us it helped us change the
conversation between smart cities and
energy companies over the years when
working in this field of IOT I had this
realization data may be worth a lot of
money data has no values values are
human thing and when we apply technology
when we design products and services we
embed our values in the design of these
products so if we want an IOT we can
trust we have to talk about ethics did
the IOT manifesto cause positive change
I don&#39;t know I might need a little bit
more data to tell for sure thank you
