morning everyone you know somebody once
said that it&#39;s the small things that
often make a big difference and I&#39;m here
perhaps to talk about one such small
thing that make it a huge difference to
me and hopefully you&#39;ll be able to take
something from that for me the journey
started about when I was about 14 years
old and my father was a senior officer
in the in an Air Force and I would like
to share with you two specific incidents
that were instrumental to specific small
incidents that were instrumental in
shaping my worldview or at least my
people view if not my worldview both
these incidents have to do with my
father who was a senior officer with the
in an Air Force a typical image of an
emphasis palette that you can conjure up
6 feet 2 inches tall broad-shouldered
extremely handsome looking man obviously
just the jeans went elsewhere the first
incident happened when I was about 14
years old and we were staying in this
Delhi Cantonment the Armed Forces area
and which was a very close-knit
community and I was out and about in the
middle of the afternoon I still remember
the month was June it was Delhi and in
the middle of the afternoon me and my
friends were out and about doing what
regular teenage boys would do you should
know when suddenly while walking around
in this marketplace one of my friends
pointed to a direction and said hey
isn&#39;t that gothics father and everybody
turned to look and as I turned to look
the site that was in front of me left me
quite shocked and embarrassed really
because what I saw was outside this
there&#39;s this car mechanic workshop where
my father used to take his car
frequently to get it repaired and
outside this workshop there was this
huge tree and under this tree was some
newspapers strewn about and sitting on
those newspapers were these mechanics
with the dirty hands and dirty clothes
having their lunch with the different
boxes open and sitting on amongst them
was my father the senior air force
officer having lunch with them and I do
want to remind you that I was all of 14
at that point of time and the only thing
that mattered to me was what my friends
think of me
anything else and I felt quite
embarrassed how could dad do such a
thing but I remember the one person who
was not at all shocked or embarrassed or
feeling uncomfortable in that entire
situation was my father
and I still remember the look on his
face he was absolutely he was happy he
was smiling he was perhaps making
conversation cracking jokes sharing
lunch with them feeling extremely
comfortable in the presence of these
people I went back home and I tried to
speak to my brother about how could dad
do something like this and he tried to
explain something to me I don&#39;t remember
that bit but this image of my father
sitting under this tree with these
mechanics having food has stayed with me
until today and that&#39;s the first
incident I wanted to share with all of
you today the second incident happened
just a year later my father got a rank
promotion and we were invited to the
commanding officers house for dinner and
I still remember we reached the house it
was a palatial building really really
huge and as I entered the house I still
remember distinctly feeling very very
out of place because the house was too
too proper too clean to rights they were
they were sculptures there was there&#39;s a
mini fountain happening in the in the
porch and there are a lot of glass
statues and I was half scared I&#39;m gonna
knock off something and break it but the
specific incident I want to share with
you is when we sat down for dinner at
the dining table huge dining table the
most fancy dining table I&#39;ve ever seen
and I&#39;m sitting there with my napkin
tucked in feeling very very odd and
uncomfortable the knife and fork and
everything the most what should I say
delicate cutlery and crockery in front
of me and I&#39;m sitting there feeling very
uncomfortable in this setting and from
the corner of my eye I see my father
sitting at the edge wearing his crisp
white shirt his maroon cravat his tweed
jacket with those leather patches
looking every bit the officer that he
was very stylish ly opening up the
bottle of wine very elegantly pouring
the wine passing it around for the
ladies passing around the cheese and the
crackers and as I looked at my father in
this after I couldn&#39;t help but compare
this image of my father with the image
of my father one year back sitting under
the tree and the question that popped in
my head was how can a man be so
adaptable and so flexible in such
diverse settings and I guess somewhere
that adaptability that flexibility
rubbed off on me and as I continued to
grow through my teens in the armed
forces set up I always had two distinct
set of friends one set of friends were
fellow kids of F osami officers with
whom I had a great time and we used to
go play tennis we used to go play squash
we used to go swimming we used to go
before 31st December we used to go
practice in the ballroom for our dance
moves we had a great time and the second
set of friends I always had was all kids
of domestic help and you have a lot of
those in in continents in the Armed
Forces areas and these kids my friends
had a fabulous time with them
they taught me fun things like how to
climb trees you know something I&#39;ve
passed on to my elder daughter who&#39;s 11
yeah and she&#39;s pretty good at it now
they taught me how to make the what do
you call it the the catapult the
slingshot how to shoot a bird with it
cooking the open done it not proud of it
today and as I continue to grow off my
teens and as I had to take a decision
about my career I wasn&#39;t sure what I
wanted to do honestly I&#39;m still not sure
what I want to do very often but one
thing became clear I wanted to be in a
space I wanted to be in a profession
that gave me an opportunity to connect
with relate with people from different
socio-economic levels different cultural
backgrounds and just see how we can
adapt flex and relate with each other
and make a difference in each other&#39;s
lives and that&#39;s the reason I do what I
do and that&#39;s the reason I&#39;ve been doing
this for the last 18 19 years and that&#39;s
the reason I stand in front of all of
you today to see how is it that we can
at least I can relate with you in this
small talk and see what is the
difference we could make and having
shared that about myself
what I obviously want to ask you is how
did you feel or the last five six
minutes hearing my own life&#39;s journey my
own life story and often when I share
something like this the kind of
responses that I get are you know it was
it was engaging I could relate to it I
could connect to it I could visualize it
yeah I still remember one of my favorite
authors growing up was in ad litem I
don&#39;t know how many of you even read
that and the best part was every five
pages I would raid the fridge because of
the way she would
the food that would be laid out on the
table and she&#39;s just brilliant at this
art of helping somebody see the story
and that&#39;s here that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to
talk to you about the art of
storytelling really which is I think a
lost art in many ways my very strong
conviction my way strong belief is that
we&#39;re all born storytellers we&#39;re all
born storytellers all of us and I
believe they&#39;re all born storytellers
who&#39;ve just become shy or unsure of
telling stories and I think as we grow
older and as you grow older younger
older the question is are we going to
start becoming shy of telling stories
which is the one thing that we come so
naturally to us and is so powerful to
help us connect with people to help us
relate with people to help us inspire
influence and help people make a change
happen so stories are in fact so
powerful that for centuries now they&#39;ve
been instrumental in shaping how
countries how societies how companies
also have been shaped over the years
right from the time of the caimans the
storytelling is by the way the most
ancient form of communication even
before language came in stories were
used to pass down information from
generation to generation to talk about
the values all of us would have heard
stories from our grandparents from our
parents some fables some stories that
passed down some message to us to
somebody once who stood up on the stage
and said I have a dream to somebody who
more recently said my dream is to put a
dent in the universe now these are all
stories that I&#39;ve really really shaped
the world shaped society and shape
people and it&#39;s important for us to
understand that this space off in this
and and the reason I want I want to talk
to you all of you about this is because
in this huge talk about artificial
intelligence and digital which is which
is great and which is happening we need
to embrace it in this entire space of
moving towards artificial intelligence
let&#39;s not lose the one thing that comes
so naturally to us which is our own
emotional intelligence our own ability
to connect with relate with people and
make a difference in their life
and I want to talk to you about why it
makes so much sense for us to tell
stories why it makes sense for each one
of you to continue to tell stories as
you pursue your dreams as you figure out
what you want to do in life because if I
was to tell you a story let me tell you
a first story first of all simple story
has the story the king died then the
Queen died yeah that&#39;s a story yeah but
let me tell you the same story again let
me say the King died then the Queen died
of grief what happens the moment I add
these two words something changes in the
story something changes in you and in
the way you receive the story and what
changes is that you start becoming more
emotionally invested in the characters
in the story or perhaps thinking oh then
the Queen Queen died of grief how would
she have felt how long were they married
for what happened you know nothing about
these characters but you&#39;ve started
getting emotionally invested in the
story and that&#39;s really the power of
stories in communicating your message to
the world in communicating your idea to
the world in communicating anything to
anyone really and I also want to talk to
you about this this this huge debate
around stories versus data when we
communicate and it&#39;s important it&#39;s
important really because all of you
growing up in this space in this world
and it&#39;s exciting because there&#39;s so
much possibility there&#39;s so much that we
can do with technology there&#39;s so much
that we can do with data and that
analytics and with information it&#39;s
amazing and I&#39;m a believer in that but
often we embrace all of that and the
cost of letting go of something that
comes very naturally to us which is
really telling stories and relating with
people and often we have this debate
around are our stories powerful or is
data more powerful you know people buy
data you give them data they&#39;ll get
convinced right so what works and to
answer this question in the year 2007
Carnegie Mellon University decided to
run a research it&#39;s publicly available
off the web
the objective of the study that they did
was to find out that when people need to
be influenced when people need to get
inspired what works more data or stories
and to do that they aren&#39;t tried a set
of a sample audience which was their
target audience and the objective was to
raise funds for a non-profit and they
decided to write two letters you know
drawing the attention of people to raise
funds for the NGO the first letter was a
story-based letter which told the
heart-wrenching story of a little girl
living in a third world nation and a day
in her life
that was the first letter the story
based there the second letter had all
the Randleman facts statistics and data
on the number of villages that don&#39;t
have Alexa T and the number of kids who
are malnutrition the number of people
who died before the age of 30 all
statistics the number of villages that
don&#39;t have a lake city that don&#39;t have
toilets so on and so forth
so first that was the story based letter
and the second letter was the database
letter and the results were quite
astounding really because the results
came out that the story based letter
sold hundred and eighteen percent more
than the database level one hundred and
eighteen percent that&#39;s a huge amount so
regardless of what we may be thinking
about facts and statistics and data what
this story is telling also this research
is telling us is that that may not be
true so the researchers at Carnegie
Mellon didn&#39;t stop there they got
excited seeing this wow this is exciting
so they said let&#39;s let&#39;s try one more
attempt you know instead of doing these
two letters let&#39;s make a third letter
let&#39;s do it again
but now this letter that we want to send
out let&#39;s make one letter that has both
story and daytime to it and that kind of
made sense you know and they said you
know the story part of the letter will
appeal to the people who like listening
to stories and you know the facts and
figures the database is part of the same
letter will appeal to the people who are
more fact oriented it orient it so they
were pretty excited and they put this
letter across sent out to people the
results were far from what they expected
and quite shocking really because the
results came out that
story and data based approach sold 40%
lesser than the letter with just the
story so regardless of what we may think
about the way we communicate the way we
express the way we influence the way we
reach out to people with data and
information
here&#39;s reality staring at us in the face
that the story based approach does help
a lot better sell to convince people to
get your idea across than data right and
that&#39;s not it that&#39;s that&#39;s just one
part of it and I&#39;m also a huge fan of
neuroscience III love that space I love
understanding how the brain functions
and let me give you some information
from the space of neuroscience to help
each one if you understand why we should
not stop telling stories you know so I&#39;m
not a medical expert but I do understand
a little bit I do like reading up on
this and the way our brain is wired and
recent technology in brain based
activity helps scientists track which
part of the brain gets activated when
something happens right and they put
these wires and there&#39;s a huge screen
and they track those activities so when
a person receives information through
only data and facts that activates only
two regions of the brain and both these
regions have only one job and the job of
both these regions is to simply give
meaning to language give meaning to
language that their translators that&#39;s
all these two regions do but when
somebody receives a story either you
listen to a story or you see a story or
you read a story it activates as many as
seven areas of our brain including what
is called our sensory cortex also called
a Broca&#39;s area so you know that&#39;s the
reason that that kind of makes sense
because if you look at it
when you&#39;re watching a movie which is a
story and there&#39;s a high-speed car chase
happening there you&#39;re gripping the seat
and you&#39;re moving like that right how&#39;s
that happening because a brain is
fooling us to tell us that that&#39;s real
and we end up behaving the same way
because senses was the same way which is
why you watch a movie where somebody&#39;s
hanging off a cliff and your palm starts
sweating right how do you
in that you see somebody having a great
meal and all these burger companies do a
great job at it right they show these
burgers right or by the way they&#39;re
never the same size as this and you see
that burger and your mouth starts
watering you see that person on screen
having that bug and you&#39;re right I have
one one right where&#39;s the next burger
joint so stories are extremely powerful
because they make people get immersed in
what you&#39;re trying to express and I
think in all of this the big question
radius what&#39;s really in it for me what&#39;s
in it for each one of you as young
students mature students professionals
individuals who want to make a change in
the community I think the first and the
biggest advantage of doing this is
storytelling really helps us establish
credibility and that&#39;s something we&#39;re
going to need a lot of as we go out and
meet more and more people it helps us in
this world of noise where there&#39;s so
much noise with there&#39;s so many people
saying so many things it helps you stand
out it helps you become memorable and
different it enables you to build
emotional connect with people which is
really important to get people invested
in you and your idea your dreams your
passion you&#39;re going to need people to
help you with that maybe even your
parents to lend you some money and it
helps you sell your idea much better
much much much better because stories
help influence not just the mind but
also the heart so in conclusion I just
want to leave you with this thought that
I still believe that we&#39;re all born
storytellers who just becomes shy or
unsure of telling stories and in my view
storytelling is a lot like dancing it&#39;s
a lot like dancing and I see it with my
two daughters every single day and in
dancing we go through these five stages
in life right I know clearly with stage
I&#39;m and I&#39;m not sure about you the first
stage is the child right and you may
have seen this image it&#39;s pretty popular
on the net the child now the child
dances and the child tells stories in
the same way right so when you&#39;re when
you&#39;re a child you dance like no one is
watching I don&#39;t care right so he does
like no one is watching and then we grow
up and when we grow up we become the
awkward team this is
moment we&#39;re from dancing like no one is
watching we start dancing like everyone
is watching okay extremely conscious at
least I was and then we reach the stage
where we become the confident team now
we dance because everyone is watching
how to show off my moves now right and
that&#39;s the same that storytelling and a
life comes back a full circle when you
go right out of the school or into a
college and you start getting into job
where you start your own firms and you
start doing whatever you do and when we
reach adulthood in this space where we
have to create an impression and we&#39;re
looking good is so important and what
people think of me is so important and
data is so important we become the adult
and we go back if you don&#39;t move forward
we go back to the stage we start dancing
like everyone is watching again I don&#39;t
want to dance no no no after one song
that&#39;s the stage I am in I guess and
dancing at least and eventually
hopefully we reach the stage of going
back to the child but this time as an
old person right again dancing like no
one is watching so I don&#39;t really know
what stage you&#39;re in but the only
message I have for you is that they&#39;re
all born storytellers it comes naturally
to us it&#39;s really powerful guys
it helps us connect it helps us relate
it helps us get our message across but
sometimes unfortunately like with
dancing we get caught in this whole
world of data and information and what
people are going to think and what
people are going to say we let go of
this art and you know the Lyle AMA has
said it beautifully in what he said here
I think it&#39;s really powerful because in
this world with so much happening we
need more people who can heal who can
spread the good word who can tell
stories who can inspire so thank you
very much everyone for hearing me out
and I wish you all the very best in
pursuing your passions for seeing your
dreams but in doing whatever you do
don&#39;t forget you&#39;ve got a lot a lot of
stories to share so thank you very much
