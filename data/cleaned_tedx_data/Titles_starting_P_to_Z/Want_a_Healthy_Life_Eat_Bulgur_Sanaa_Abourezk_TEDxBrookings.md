hi I&#39;m Sena and I love food I love it
enough that I left engineering to become
a chef so I want to start by asking you
a question have you ever thought who&#39;s
in charge of your health you I hope so
government I hope not
they&#39;re food companies definitely not so
you if you think about it we are born
with our own genetic that we can&#39;t
change at least not yet
we are live in the same environment with
the pollution but also we have no
control of so only thing we have control
of is food we put in our mouth so I hope
I time I&#39;m done that should become what
I call a conscious eater you are
conscious of what you put in your mouth
because I believe no matter you know
you&#39;re engineer a doctor anything if you
don&#39;t take care of this this is awesome
I come to work I actually I know when
I&#39;m hungry I&#39;m very crabby and I know
what when my staff bring me an apple
they&#39;re telling me you are crappy that&#39;s
their gentle way of telling me that so
we really have to be conscious of what
will be eaten what we put in our mouth
and that&#39;s why I want to tell you about
a wonderful ingredient that I&#39;m very
passionate about bulgur wheat most of
you you think you don&#39;t know what bulgur
wheat is but most of you I think had to
bully if you have to bully you eat
bulgur wheat so what&#39;s bhagavate bulgur
wheat is a wheat that&#39;s been barred
boiled and dried and I have to tell you
whoever came up with this idea our great
great great ancestors in the
Mediterranean did a favour
to the to my family and to the
humanities so they every village before
technology anything they blend their
wheat and then you know they cut it and
about October the women of the village
get together and they assign date so
let&#39;s say Monday would be so nice day so
every village will have huge pot huge
pot and three he large stones and the
man they&#39;re more than happy to carry the
pots the night before and the stones to
the designated house and the woman about
four o&#39;clock in the morning they get up
all the women in the village get up
together and they go to Santa&#39;s home and
they fill up the water in the pot and
they put the weed and they boil it
meantime the men are sleeping and the
woman don&#39;t mind because that&#39;s the time
of visiting and you know gossiping and
the whole thing because they have to
wait for the whole pot to boil after it
boils you know while they&#39;re having
their tea and everything then they use a
huge kind of spoon as you see in this
picture to put to put all the wheat the
one bar boiled bit in a basket that&#39;s
hand waving and also it passed from
generation to generation and they put it
on their shoulders and they go take it
to the my roof that&#39;s today is my turn
to burn to boil dewitt the roof has been
already cleaned and it&#39;s flat and they
have nice white sheet on it and they put
the weight on that sheet and they leave
it there for about ten days to dry in
the mail train Ian&#39;s son so in order to
make sure it all dries that&#39;s how they
reward their kids so we all can switch
to wash our feet and then we take turns
to walk through all the weight and we
make a design and you know we show up oh
I did and it looks like almost like a
Japanese rock garden it&#39;s beautiful but
if you think about something if you have
wheat on the roof of the building
and you have birds what happens it&#39;s all
done so long time ago I have like I said
I you know you have to admire I mean now
we have all this technology we can come
up with other things but they then they
thought of putting shiny threads that
loosely over the weed so when the wind
blow it it keep reflecting in the Sun so
it keep the birds away recently I mean
my mom&#39;s time they start taking from the
kids like cassette tapes remember the
old cassette tapes so they pull it and
my mom used to make a point you know I
always wanted to come to America so I
liked Elvis Presley he was the first
American singer I ever heard so she&#39;d
make a point cause still Elvis Presley&#39;s
cassette because she hated him and she
will take the thread and they bought it
over all the weeds and of course when I
come to see it and she&#39;s my mom you know
she&#39;s paying for my food I couldn&#39;t say
anything just go to my room like so
that&#39;s why I came to America so I can
listen to Elvis Presley anyway after 10
days the women come all again and you
know so my shirt usually like you know
my mom we about 200 kilos so we&#39;re
talking about 500 pounds cuz I make
enough for the whole year so they take
it down I want to show you this picture
first and then a long time ago they used
to put it in a big pot and then they
have two stones and these stones they
have a hole under the top and the woman
sits on the floor and they book the
bulgar inside it the weed inside it and
they grind it so if they go five times
you have the fine bulgur wheat the one
you use in tabbouleh if you do it only
three times you have the core sweet
that&#39;s the one we use to pour pilaf and
then they give it to the grandmothers
they get them nice baklava
you know they promise them nice dress
and all the old ladies sit and each one
has a huge like almost like a wooden
calendar and they go through it like
this and they this way some of the
stones anything that the birds left on
the bird on the weeds it goes away and
they put it on the roof again and I dry
it again for ten days by doing this
process you have an a green light
literally it keeps for years no in a
second you can put anywhere doesn&#39;t need
any temperature just it stays there and
it tastes wonderful also by doing that
you don&#39;t need to boil it so long if you
anybody bought weeds for any recipe you
put the water and you wait you put the
water and you wait it takes forever and
it just tastes like weed by bar boiling
the weed and sundry it you have
something like that it&#39;s actually it
doesn&#39;t take long time to cook and it
has a nice nutty flavor and nice texture
so what&#39;s so special about bulgur why
I&#39;m so passionate about it I have to
tell you by the way
you know I&#39;m an engineer you know my
parents sent me to America and the whole
thing my mom&#39;s freaking out that I&#39;m
smoking about beaurevel you know she
when we talk about you know brain
surgery is some if you will engine
something she&#39;s it Buddhahood you&#39;re
talking about send you to America to
talk about Buddhahood well I I am big
believer in good nutrition so it bulgur
is one cup of parole it gives you 50% of
your daily requirement of fiber think
about one cup also it&#39;s high in fiber
which we sort about sorry high high in
protein high in zinc high in iron
vitamin E and also what&#39;s so unique
about it after you buy boiled it it
become Lord glycemic what that mean as
mean when you eat it your blood sugar
doesn&#39;t shoot high which is make it
excellent ingredient for anybody who&#39;s
washing watching their diet or have
diabetes also now so now I talk to you
about it I hope I get a little bit
interested now I want to get you really
interested we have a joke when we was
when I was studying nutrition at college
that if you dig the grave of an American
after 200 years you&#39;ll find them the
same
that&#39;s why preservative because
everything we eat is has preservative
additive you know all the stuff and
that&#39;s again I know I keep coming again
conscious eating conscious eating so I
went to market and I bought like the
best bread I can find that&#39;s the best
it&#39;s a huge ingredient list but if you
look at the second ingredient they use
Bruegel to enrich the best bread you
have in the market if you check on
burgers what&#39;s the ingredient one burger
there is no additives no preservatives
no color no coloring no chemicals that
we can pronounce just pour over so
that&#39;s by itself it&#39;s wonderful because
the more we like that nutritious we eat
the less preservative we eat the better
flavour we&#39;re doing for our body also
beaurevel like I said they would boil
200 kilos it has a long long shelf life
when I used to come to America when I
was in student and go back home
summertime my suitcase would be about 25
kilos of just Borivali and the guy at
the airport you know look at it and said
what&#39;s this and for me it was like a
shotgun because who doesn&#39;t know Bravo
and you know I would keep it and in my
suitcase under the bed because it was
available anytime I want to eat
something I&#39;ll add just the sauce or
even water and I
I eat it it&#39;s very inexpensive one pound
of bulgur wheat in the United States is
dollar twenty-five cents and believe me
you don&#39;t want to cook the whole one
pound of butter oil it expands so I want
to make this dish I want because I have
all the ingredients already at the
restaurant but I want to make a point so
to make this pilaf that feed at least
four people I went and I get them from
the market so the tomatoes the garbanzo
beans the olive oil double Gore
everything came to $6 53 cents that&#39;s
less what you pay for a burger that can
I&#39;m not going to name names but you know
some poor girls can they literally take
you right
directly to your heart attack this one
with $6 53 cents you get a new protein
your fiber your iron you think your
antioxidant everything it&#39;s delicious
for $66 53 cents you can feed so it&#39;s
very good for your budget that&#39;s another
thing we have to think about especially
if we are in college
vulgar weight also doesn&#39;t need heat so
we all like pasta you can cook pasta
without heat we all like old you can
cook it without heat bulgur actually you
do that&#39;s what the bully is the bully
you put the bulgur and you add the
ingredient by time you finish you have
to bully a chorus course / goal so I
know what I do I add water go take a
shower
come back add all the ingredients and
you have this wonderful salad we do it
at the restaurant we call it house salad
because I eat it every single day and
other thing about burger is ideal left
over it tastes much better the day after
so the that will no girl you keep it the
better it tastes because keep taking all
the liquids you know anybody who made
the salad I want on a picnic you have to
do it right away or eat it right away
because it goes watery watery watery
unless you have butter oil in it keep
taking the water the water so the salad
stays nice and attacked for days that&#39;s
why the bullies taste for it can stay a
month in your in your fridge but I eat
it all like never start more than two
days but when I make a pilaf especially
if I use one pound
we have other fluff overs and my husband
even though he like but all he hates it
when I make bank or pilaf because I make
it today
what were you having Bogart okay so he
you don&#39;t have nice salad next to it
second day what are we having
whatever so okay so now I love but a lot
but please can we move a little bit away
but it&#39;s wonderful for you if you
actually have a college of you&#39;re on a
budget because it tastes good day after
day the day after day if you think about
it you know we go to Chinese restaurant
we&#39;ll always take it up
over the rice stay dries you know you
open the box it&#39;s really dry you can&#39;t
eat it if you have left old pasta it&#39;s
mushy you can&#39;t eat it bowl or you can
keep eating it but don&#39;t make one pound
to 2 cups maximum for four days don&#39;t
wanna and I want you to hate it I want
you to like it so now you know the last
thing I wanna tell you think I&#39;d let ask
you you know when you go to a gas
station have you ever thought for
putting the wrong caste in your car oh
no today I want to think about diesel
and my engine no you do a research
what&#39;s the best oil was the best things
for your car and this is just a car an
engine that you can replace so I wanted
to do the same effort when you put
something new in mouth after all we
can&#39;t replace this at least I think I&#39;m
not replaceable another thing is you
know that&#39;s why sometimes people don&#39;t
think of nutrition because do you don&#39;t
see it on the spot you know we eat junk
food but after a while we have the heart
attack
and good nutrition is like good
investments you do it slowly
continuously and on the long run it pays
big same thing with nutrition after all
it&#39;s not that want is that not the
quantity is the quality you want to be
at least I want to be an unused old
person running a marathon so that&#39;s what
important that&#39;s why you see people a
Mediterranean you their old age they
have beautiful skin they still playing
backgammon they still walk in everything
is nutrition that they ate every single
day so one thing like again I&#39;m going to
go mom and leave you with that thought
well God is the food of the poor so
nobody think of like if you&#39;re a guest
on you know to cook golf or use rice
with meat because I mean God forbid you
know you&#39;re a guest so when I tell my
mom she you know I call her and she say
she said you know I told her I&#39;m giving
the speech about whatever I said you
know I said but what she said you mean
people come to your restaurant and pay
money to eat Bravo
I said yes and I cherished nine dollars
for it she said you know a nine dollars
much
applied for Syrian pounds likely paying
1000 she said they paying how much has
it been nine dollars it beautiful she
said American you are crazy said mom
American are not crazy with just we know
good food when we taste it
thank you
[Applause]
