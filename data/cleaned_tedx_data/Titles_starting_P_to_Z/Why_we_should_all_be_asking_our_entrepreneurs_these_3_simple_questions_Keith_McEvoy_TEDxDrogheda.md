one nappy changed my life forever and is
about it was exactly 15 years ago I
remembered so vividly I was September
2002 second week of September and I was
just a wreck I was a two and a half we
called dad and I hadn&#39;t a clue what I
was doing I had the responsibility of
this little baby that had just jumped
into our life and I was a fraud
people call me dad but I tell you I had
no idea what I was doing and there was
one nice little baby there actually so
small as not who&#39;s up to hearing them
and you know the usual thing okay let&#39;s
go first peel back one tab then peel
back the other tab and then put down the
nappy and then as I was reaching across
get the baby wipe it struck me and it
was like the heavens opened and and the
light came down on top of me I would
fold back over the nappy so they
wouldn&#39;t get squirted in the face and I
knew at that point I was dad I&#39;d made it
I&#39;d figure this out on my own and and
what I went through on right next I
changing that is exactly what you go
through when you take on a new identity
it&#39;s the same three stages the first
stage is the commitment so I was
committed to being a dad I had a
nine-month warning notice on this so I
was all in for it yeah and then the
second stage is the competent stage now
two and a half weeks in I still hadn&#39;t
dropped the baby I was doing well and I
knew that you know crying was bad but it
was only that night that I got to the
third and the most important stage and
that was confidence it was that night
doing that little thing and realizing it
all by myself that I realized I own this
I am dad
and and that right there became an
amazing part of who I am I am dad dad is
me I get judged by dad my teenage
teenagers they can annoy to me because
I&#39;m dad and embarrassed but I am dad
yeah now imagine imagine
tomorrow was standing here in front of
you Robin this is a red circle and I was
no longer dad could you imagine us I&#39;d
be devastated
because a huge part of my life would
have been ripped away from me now that&#39;s
exactly what happens to someone when
they leave their job to go and start a
business
exactly what happens to them one day
they&#39;re there everything&#39;s perfect the
following day they lose their job title
they lose the social network to lose all
their mates around the water cooler they
lose it all it&#39;s all gone the corner
office everything gone and they have to
start from scratch all over again and I
know because I&#39;ve done that three times
I&#39;ve left a job to start up a business
and it is hard it&#39;s no wonder that 90%
of people who leave their jobs less than
two years later they&#39;re back again
working that idea about being an
entrepreneur and a company owner is
shattered in and gone so where am I
going with this why am I telling you
about this and why how it matters well
you&#39;ve got friends right you&#39;ve probably
got family members
you probably got work colleagues and
they&#39;re thinking of starting a business
or maybe they&#39;re actually running a
business I don&#39;t want to give you a
little insight what&#39;s going on in their
heads right this second so three weeks
ago I was having breakfast with an
entrepreneurial friend of mine and she
is mmm or a confident full of energy
Duracell bunny you know all that in fact
she&#39;s type of person you don&#39;t want to
give her too much coffee in case you
just explode in front of you and just
tell me about her she&#39;d been to the UK
to expressly to go to a big lavish event
and that the lavish event are going to
be friends of hers and some ex work
colleagues that she used to work in the
UK and has just asked me so how did it
go and what you said shocked me she said
I didn&#39;t go I couldn&#39;t go so you&#39;ve gone
all the way to the UK and she didn&#39;t go
to the event so I asked her why and
started a bit then she told me so
basically if I&#39;d gone to that event
people would have asked me what are you
doing how&#39;s business I said those people
they knew me as this high-powered
executive you know go and get it done
and I&#39;d have to try and tell him but
like my business and here it is and the
small little things that they&#39;re doing
and it just struck me she didn&#39;t have
the confidence yet to see yourself as
this entrepreneur she hadn&#39;t developed
that yet and it&#39;s no surprise that
actually as the conversation went on she
started telling me how she&#39;s starting to
look for jobs again she was gonna leave
that and go back to the corporate world
and ashamed because she&#39;s such a brain
and talent to bring to us but but why
should we care let&#39;s be honest okay this
is just an entrepreneur you know it&#39;s
rough and tough she took a gamble it
hasn&#39;t worked out for her so why should
you care well is does anyone here want
tomorrow to be just a little bit better
than today yeah let me anyone what next
week better than yeah next month better
and last month yet is there anyone here
want your future to be a little bit
better than your current yeah we all do
right we all want that that&#39;s part of
being human and here&#39;s where
entrepreneurs come in entrepreneurs
they&#39;re the guys and the gals who take
the needs and wants that that we want to
de Bri don&#39;t have and they make them
real they create the products and
services that take us forward how cool
is that so we need entrepreneurs we need
loads of them and and oh my god we&#39;ve
loads them around our communities with
entrepreneurs setting up shops opening
restaurants looking after our children
looking after our fitness and our health
and our sick
we even entrepreneur is trying to send
us to the moon hey how cool
so entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of
what we want we can&#39;t afford to have
entrepreneurs just wandering back into
corporate world because they couldn&#39;t
connect with their identity yet what a
waste
we want more entrepreneurs to have a
better future for all of us right so
I&#39;ve got they see three minutes of 51 in
50 seconds and I&#39;m going to create
entrepreneur makers added each and every
one of you alright my magic wand there
it is waving away and what what I need
you to do is remember my friend who
couldn&#39;t answer a question without
confidence I&#39;m going to give you three
little questions that&#39;s going to
generate the confidence in entrepreneurs
and you&#39;re gonna ask these questions of
every entrepreneur you meet so your
family member who&#39;s thinking of starting
a business or is out there your friends
random strangers don&#39;t care but the
three questions are really simple the
first question is who is your customer
the second question what are you selling
and the third question how are you
selling it so who was and how and here&#39;s
why those three questions are so
important those three questions are the
basis of every single successful
business forget about all the other
stuff these are the three key things in
the business and if an entrepreneur can
nail them they&#39;re going to be successful
if an entrepreneur can nail them they&#39;re
going to have the confidence that
they&#39;re going to be successful they&#39;re
going to own their role as an
entrepreneur but just like me as a dad
it took me what fifty attempts to try
and figure out how to change a nappy if
my wife would say a lot fewer but we
won&#39;t go there an entrepreneur these
lows of opportunity to go and practice
then they don&#39;t get this right initially
takes them two or three hundred attempts
and the more times that we can ask them
to try and get that out the quicker that
they&#39;re going to get it their answer and
they&#39;re gonna have their aha moment and
they&#39;re gonna figure this out and get to
their confidence now an added incentive
for you guys here tonight is that I know
in our myths in our community we have a
pile of entrepreneurs and one of them I
want to tell you about she has a cure
for loneliness how cool is that a cure
for loneliness right and I kid you not
she&#39;s already helped about a hundred
people and she and her business has the
power and opportunity to help millions
millions right but here&#39;s the problem
she hasn&#39;t nailed these three questions
yet so she&#39;s not confident at the moment
that her business is gonna succeed in
fact every now and again I meet her
she&#39;s like oh maybe she go back to
workers check the jobs that would be a
travesty guys yeah absolute travesty so
we can&#39;t let that happen right at all
so given this such a small community I
know
guaranteed that within this audience
with people who will meet her
this week over the next few weeks and
over the next few months and you might
know her but if you ask any random
entrepreneur those three questions I
guarantee a few of you are going to be
asking her specifically to get those
right and the thing is is that it could
be you it could be you ask those
questions but she has the clouds opening
the light coming down and she gets it
she gets it and she grabs that and she
goes forward with her business yeah how
cool how cool right so the three
questions again right random antler I
don&#39;t care but these are three questions
you have to ask them right you have to
ask them who&#39;s your customer what are
you selling and how are you selling it
who what and how because if you ask them
you&#39;re improving your future you&#39;re
improving my son&#39;s future you&#39;re
improving your family&#39;s future and
together we&#39;re going to make all of our
of tomorrow&#39;s but a little bit better
than today thank you
[Applause]
you
