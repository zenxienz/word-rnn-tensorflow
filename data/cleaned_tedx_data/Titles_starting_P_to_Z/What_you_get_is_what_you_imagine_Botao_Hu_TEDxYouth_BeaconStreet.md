you may wonder how dislike a beautiful
landscape and have been taken so my
short answer is I engineered them so my
name is beau Tahu and I am landscape
photographer and also I am also a
computer scientist graduate from
Stanford today I&#39;m very happy to be here
to share with you my story about
engineering and art artists has vision
and usually artists need to convert that
vision into their medium as an artwork
and this conversion process is not very
easy sometimes have a lot of barriers
the barrier might be include skill
budget logistic execution physical limit
and also technical available a lot of
artists the creativity is limited by the
barriers and it&#39;s very common
frustration for artists to compromise
their vision because of those barriers
so as a photographer myself I like run
into this situation very very often and
as an engineer I try to look a way to
solve this problem and I the solution I
discovered is engineering itself so the
first story I want to share with you is
about chasing the sound and I was a
member of photography club in my
undergrad and grad college and that Club
just bunch of geeks and almost every
everyone has an engineering background
but we love photographs and the concept
for this photo is very easy just a
little guy holding a giant a huge sum
but the execution part for this
photograph it&#39;s very very hard it&#39;s more
it&#39;s very like a scientific research
project you need to like using
mathematical tool to calculate the
trajectory of the Sun the moment and the
distance where you can like a photograph
this I did this photo not only that you
also need to use geo information system
to to search in all the location in your
city to find the best spot to put the
sound right above the building or the
person so it took us one year to get
like some beautiful composition between
some and building person and airplane
finally we published this work as a
cover story on National Geography and
just talking about how we do the
calculation and the experience I get
from this project said like a foundation
for my photography style which is
engineering and the calculation here&#39;s
the second story I want to share with
you it&#39;s about a fire waterfall and this
is it and it&#39;s very rare but very famous
national a very famous neutral
phenomenon in Yosemite National Park in
California and the waterfall usually
looks boring just waterfall and but if
you run the sunlight simulation in the
software you will find in every year the
four day after Valentine&#39;s Day there&#39;s
ten minutes window the sunset the
setting sunlight while crossing all the
yosemite valley narrow divided rocks the
mountain to project on that waterfall
with just right angle to illuminate the
upper part of the water waterfall even
though you&#39;ll know that timing
you&#39;re still need to physically go to
the location to take the photograph and
I choose all this like Canada like a
location but I&#39;ve
and in my opinion the best location will
be the rat spot and which is very hard
to go there in the winter so what can I
do
and the solution very simple and I&#39;ll
learn how to climb I just climbed there
and get the shot mission complete
and climbing for me it&#39;s a it&#39;s a set of
engineering technique to protect myself
and also let me to reach some places
that other people cannot reach to so can
take some like a beautiful photo like
this and this and I climbed a lot of
place seems crazy and even climbing is a
very good like engineering skill for me
to reach some like larger the places I
can go to but let&#39;s also make question
is how can I put my camera anywhere I
want
how about a drone like five years ago
emerging drone technology like like just
seems like a very ideal tool to
achieving my dream I dream and the four
years ago I bought my first drone I took
I took it everywhere and I take a lot of
awesome like a unshot with my drum seems
like the problem soft right so this is
gongs and oops
yes but I&#39;m a horrible toilet drone
crashes and last four last four year
college room and I drone crashing to
ground tree building and anything you
can imagine and also the battery is very
dangerous it&#39;s caught fire it&#39;s hard
control drone really and I I&#39;m not like
learning like any like a piloting skill
I just want to photograph and that&#39;s why
I always keep felt like but this
essential reason is the drone is very
hard to control because Joe has a ninety
degree of freedom the drone system
itself have six forward backward uh up
and down left and right and also the
camera system has three like Petri are
in the row so ninety degree of freedom
so the pilot needs to train themselves
to transfer their imagination to a 3d
camera motion in the space and by
manipulating the joystick in their
finding fingertips and that&#39;s very
complex translation process so I take a
Hollywood Z as example and usually Holly
will require two people to control a
drone one people control the camera one
people piloting the drone so they have
enough hand maybe four hand to control
the night degree of freedom so even like
a day you have the very good pilot but
student into communication so directors
usually it&#39;s very fine is very hard to
communicate with pilot because some
pilot doesn&#39;t learn the artistic like
background so it&#39;s very hard to
communicate so there&#39;s always
information lost between director or
original vision and what the pilot it
you can finally get so and uh
occasionally the palate I can get a very
very good shot but it&#39;s very difficult
to for them to repeat the shot which is
very
in Hollywood industry because where they
want to have the several take for the
exact exactly the same shot so seems
like a drone it&#39;s very approaching to my
ultimate like a dream system but simply
bring more barrier to two in front of me
so how can I solve this question at this
problem so imagine if what if there is
like there&#39;s a sweetie model or like a
miniature version of the scene you want
to film in front of you and I think you
can just manipulate the camera very
easily just like it this like
stop-motion setup you can&#39;t because
everything is shrink down so you can
move around to take the photo you want
and alternatively you can be a giant
like like a buildings or giant to
control a drone back with your hand
that&#39;s also very cool unfortunately
there&#39;s no technology can help you scale
up or have the environment and scale
down so what can I do
so I actually trying to bend the rule of
reality by the power of virtual reality
so you can immerse into this virtual San
Francisco by wearing of your goggle you
can like it walk like Godzilla and see
in your playground and now I have a very
intuitive like tool to access this like
a miniature world so I can control the
camera as if like it&#39;s in my hand I can
plan the shot I can add it in the shot
in the virtual world like that and also
I can preview the shot before I even go
to the location so I can like address
the shot whenever I want
until I satisfy it if i satisfy the shot
I created a virtual world I can send
that to the real drill the drone will
fly out to match the exactly essential I
plan in the virtual world
that&#39;s the very smooth cinematic shot
taken by the drone and it&#39;s without any
human error
no one control the drone actually
so actually now the drone fly like 20
meters per second it&#39;s very hard for
human to control the drone but still
maintain the smoothness and here is a
comparison about the tribe plan in the
virtual reality and the real footage you
can see it&#39;s very accurate so what
you&#39;re imagining is what you get and
that here is also a comparison between
to take for the same shot one happened
in morning one happening in afternoon
it&#39;s almost identical so you can create
a repeatable shot so to achieve this
position and also repeatability I spent
last two year to study robotics and to
build I saw a robotic navigation system
software embedded in the stay of Lea the
drone system and also I build the
virtual reality interface - I like to
reduce the barrier of the artist to the
technology and now I&#39;m not only can
create the precise repeatable shot I
also can create some like impossible
shot for the like human hand like it&#39;s
just like an animation so in the real
world so to summary like a holiday most
of art artwork is limited by the barrier
like technology barrier I think in the
future the technology like the artwork
were only limited by creators creativity
and all the barrier well will be handled
by robotics and the computation power so
in my imagination the future filmmaking
can even just one person operation you
can like it just like express your
vision into the virtual system maybe we
are maybe AR and then the drone or the
robot will take care of the rest of part
they will carry camera lights props
even like became an actor for you to
directly transfer your idea into a real
product and
[Music]
and I think I&#39;m what I&#39;m still walking
on this and a lot of people think art
and the technology is separated but I
think is not I I I have like just only
scratched the surface of the what&#39;s
possible with the power of engineering
so I hope my story can like encourage
you to embrace the power of engineering
to push the frontier of creativity and
what you&#39;re imagining is what you get
thank you
