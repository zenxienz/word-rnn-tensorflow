can you remember a time when you felt
left out or just different from the rest
of the crowd someone on the autism
spectrum such as myself may experience
these emotions frequently but do they
say everything about the condition of
course autism has always existed in our
world although it wasn&#39;t until the 1940s
when pediatrician Hans Asperger
published the first-ever paper on the
autistic diagnosis we now know as
Asperger&#39;s syndrome he discovered that
autism is suspension condition this
means that while those with autism share
certain characteristics at the same time
every diagnosis is slightly different
just as each and every one of you is so
wonderfully unique generally an autistic
spectrum disorder will affect a child or
adult in the following areas social
interactions senses and behavior
patterns on a negative side we may
become rigidly attached to routine or
take things literally as a child I
struggle to understand idioms and
consequently spent time dedicated
learning how to use them but come on now
let&#39;s get those gates on autism does not
limit our busy to achieve great things
indeed people with autism can become
great specialists for example some
autism experts believe that key figures
such as Mozart Sir Isaac Newton and
Albert Einstein may have been on the
autism spectrum themselves another more
recent example is the highly talented
artist Stephen Wiltshire who uses pay
and pencil to express emotion after just
a brief flight over a city in the
helicopter he&#39;s able to recreate the
landscape in amazingly accurate detail
from memory before I finish I would like
to share a final photo with you of
myself and my best friend Olivia at our
Leivers prom last year I have chosen
this particular photograph as emphasizes
that many people on the autism spectrum
can live normal lives without their
diagnosis affecting them in overly
negative way as long as they receive the
appropriate support from the wider
community
yes autism is a lifelong condition but
it is not necessarily a disability just
a fundamental aspect of our unique
personalities thank you for listening
[Applause]
