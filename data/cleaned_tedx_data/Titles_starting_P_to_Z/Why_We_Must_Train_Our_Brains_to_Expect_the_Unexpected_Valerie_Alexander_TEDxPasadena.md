let&#39;s start with a brain exercise I&#39;m
going to ask you to visualize three
scenarios the visualization part is very
important so please close your eyes take
a deep breath and imagine you&#39;re late to
catch a flight you rush through the
airport you make it through security you
run to the gate you make it down the
jetway you step on the plane just as
they close the door behind you and the
pilot steps out of a cockpit to say hi
you get to your destination you go to a
local restaurant and you have the best
meal of your life and really enjoy this
there&#39;s no calories and visualization
and at the table next to you is a couple
happily celebrating their anniversary
the next morning you go to the biggest
technology conference in the world and
the CEO of this year&#39;s hot hottest tech
startup just took the stage to speak now
you should have a solid picture of all
of that so open your eyes because I have
some questions for you in your mental
image was the pilot black was the
married couple
two men did the tech CEO on stage look
like me it&#39;s okay if one or all of your
answers is no your brain creates images
of what&#39;s familiar it&#39;s less of a fan of
what&#39;s not familiar the things I
mentioned are generally less familiar
the black pilot the same-sex married
couple
the female tech CEO no matter how much
you might love the idea of those things
when immediately confronted with them
the amygdala
that&#39;s the most ancient part of your
brain signals the hypothalamus to fire
up the hypothalamic pituitary axis which
is where the brain and the endocrine
system intersect so at this point your
adrenal glands release cortisol into
your bloodstream which triggers your
stress response this is the physiology
of stress
according to the Dartmouth undergraduate
Journal of science and it happens in a
matter of milliseconds long before you
have the chance to consciously think I&#39;m
so happy these two men have the freedom
to marry who they love as dr. Susan
Fiske explains when it comes to
unfamiliar social situations there is
ample evidence then encountering
something fundamentally different from
what we expect elicits a stronger
activation in the amygdala than
encountering something or someone we
proceed as the norm this is what kept
our species alive for millions of years
this instantaneous instinctive response
triggers fight-or-flight which is what
kept us from being eaten by
saber-toothed Tigers or killed by a
member of a foreign tribe but in modern
society our brains still do this when we
encounter the unexpected our heart races
slightly our blood pressure goes up we
sweat a little and for no discernible
reason we just feel stressed out there&#39;s
a Chinese blessing that doubles as a
curse may you live in interesting times
I am the CEO of a tech company right now
which makes these some very interesting
times I recently had a call with a
potential investor in which everything
clicked he got the concept he loved what
we were building he had key insight
about our tech and so we agreed on a day
to speak again and he said great
why don&#39;t you ping me then and I said
you got it and then he said oh wait is
that one of those phrases I&#39;m not
supposed to use with you because he&#39;s a
man and I&#39;m a woman and in the tech
world right now
careers are being destroyed and entire
venture funds collapsing because some
men have behaved incredibly
inappropriately towards women he was
afraid of using the phrase ping me now
that might seem ridiculous but we now
live in a world where words and phrases
rapidly take on new meaning if you need
proof just look at the Facebook post of
any guy who got a text from his mom that
says hi honey if you want to come over
tonight we can Netflix and chill
if you don&#39;t understand why that&#39;s funny
google netflix and chill&#39; he asked is
that one of those phrases I&#39;m not
supposed to use with you and there it
was I could practically hear the
cortisol coursing through his
bloodstream no matter how well we
clicked or what he thought of my company
it was still in his brain that I&#39;m not
just a CEO I&#39;m a female CEO and working
with me might be a minefield of
dangerous he has to think about not
because of anything he would ever do or
anything I would ever do but because men
neither of us had ever met couldn&#39;t
control their bro havior
and women we both respect bravely chose
not to remain silent
because speaking up is the only way
we&#39;re going to make progress so in
addition to all the risks inherent in
investing in an early-stage startup
company there&#39;s an added layer of much
scarier risks that come from working
with me the irony is that while some
investors might feel that way for
another cohort because I&#39;m over 40 they
don&#39;t even see me
I am simultaneously both highly
dangerous and invisible
[Laughter]
who knows that at this stage in my
career I&#39;d become a ninja
[Music]
is that one of those phrases I&#39;m not
supposed to use with you I am so
grateful that he asked I&#39;m happy that he
felt safe enough to ask and know that I
wouldn&#39;t pummel him for it if we&#39;re
going to get anywhere close to equality
let&#39;s stop attacking our allies when
someone is willing to admit and discuss
that there might be a problem with their
own behavior
we can&#39;t penalize them for that how
would any of us feel to be excluded from
the Equality conversation because of
what we visualized at the start of this
talk by asking the question I knew this
man was willing to examine his own
behavior and I believe that the biggest
stumbling block to achieving true
equality is unexamined behavior when men
in the startup world start to wonder if
I work with women am I going to someday
be the subject of an incendiary blog
post the answer is no just continue to
examine your behavior when working with
female founders and colleagues and
executives ask yourself if this was a
man would I gently stroked his shoulder
as I suggest we meet again
what I comment on how well his t-shirt
flatters his figure would I place a
higher value on his appearance and his
experience in determining his
probability of success if not don&#39;t do
it to her it&#39;s that simple
sadly the much simpler response to the
female threat is no you will not be the
subject of an angry blogpost just don&#39;t
work with women of course no one would
ever say that out loud but somewhere in
that amygdala a synapse fires towards
flight in the face of an unnamed
potential danger and stress hormones
flood the bloodstream can&#39;t explain it
don&#39;t know why but whatever makes you
feel happy and comfortable around people
who look and act like you is the same
thing that makes you come up with
logical explicable totally defensible
reasons not to work with someone you
just don&#39;t click with and when it comes
to equality examining our own behavior
applies to women too I started my career
as a securities lawyer in the Silicon
Valley at the dawn of the Internet era
it was an insane time to be there as a
first-year associate I build twenty
eight hundred hours one night I left the
office around 2 a.m. which was typical
and so I left my timesheets for my
assistant to process because she got in
in the mornings before I did so the next
day when I got to my desk about five
minutes later and my assistant walks in
holding my timesheets and she said would
you like me to show you how to enter
these into the billing system I mean
sweet as pie and I sat stunned for a
moment then politely declined her kind
offer but that question really started
to bother me why would my assistant ask
the attorney she works for if I want to
learn how to do her job so I started
asking around of the 14 male attorneys
in our group none had ever been asked if
he wanted to learn how to use the
billing system
we had a partner who didn&#39;t know there
was a billing system but of the six
female attorneys I was the only one who
had never entered her own timesheets
some of them did it regularly in some
just once or twice but they all knew how
so again I asked why why would you spend
a resource as precious as your time on
work someone else is already getting
paid to do one answer was oh it&#39;s not
that hard
women do this to ourselves a lot we do
work that someone else&#39;s job because
we&#39;re capable and we just wanted to get
done if a task is on someone else&#39;s
to-do list please don&#39;t be the first
person in line to do it for them not
only does that hurt you it sets an
expectation that hurts all other women
the other answer to my question was it&#39;s
just easier the knowing laugh
translation it&#39;s just easier to do my
assistants work than to make my
assistant do it when we talk about
gender disparity in the workplace we
discuss the different treatment women
receive in performance reviews and
promotions
or in hiring and salary negotiations but
we rarely discuss the treatment women
receive from subordinates we fail to
acknowledge how exhausting it is to not
get the basic level of support needed to
do our jobs and that our male colleagues
enjoy without even thinking twice about
it
or to get it but only because we
demanded it and risk being labeled
certain word or two so we give in we
pile more on our own plates because in
the short term it&#39;s just easier and in
the long term we burnout and leave and
in hindsight everyone wonders why there
aren&#39;t more women in higher ranking
positions because no one ever examined
the behavior
the funny thing about my situation is
that if you asked the assistants in that
group if they treated male attorneys and
female attorneys differently I&#39;m pretty
sure every one of them would have said
no way and yet no male attorney had ever
been asked if you wanted to learn how to
do administrative work and every female
attorney had that&#39;s the real danger of
unexamined behavior the beliefs that
we&#39;re treating everyone equally
when in reality were not when we stop
and examine our own behavior we can
catch ourselves having different
reactions to and expectations of people
simply because they don&#39;t look like us
or worse because they do the human brain
is a remarkable achievement in evolution
the prefrontal cortex evolved itself
into existence when we needed more
processing capacity how amazing is that
but the amygdala that&#39;s been there since
the earliest records of human existence
when an encounter is the unexpected it
floods your system with stress stress
hormones fight-or-flight is what kept
our species alive for millions of years
none of us in 100 lifetimes will ever be
able to change that trigger inside our
brains so our only solution is to change
what&#39;s outside our brains to consciously
turn the unexpected into the expected so
that we don&#39;t have unconscious hormonal
reactions that keep our society from
moving forward how do you do that how do
you change the unexpected to the
expected well there are three things you
can try one as you go about your day
visualize situations before they happen
the meeting you&#39;re about to walk into
the new doctor you&#39;re seeing the driver
you just pulled over for having a broken
taillight and whatever mental picture
you get change it open yourself to
different possibilities
the second thing when we do encounter
the unexpected have the courage to
examine your own behavior ask yourself
is this how I would handle this
interaction if this person looked like
me or if this person didn&#39;t look like me
third make a conscious effort to expose
yourself and your children and others to
that which is currently unexpected and
doesn&#39;t need to be higher the employees
patronize the businesses vote for the
candidates who have earned the position
and are also challenging the norms there
are enormous and long ranging
consequences when we can change the
unexpected to the expected consider this
we have two entire generations in the
world whose first visual image of a
United States president is black it
doesn&#39;t matter what kind of hate or
ugliness might have been spoken in their
homes that picture is always within the
realm of the expected for them we
normalize things by making them expected
that is the first step towards keeping
all women from being seen as higher risk
investments and women of a certain age
from becoming ninjas
let&#39;s do another visualization once
again please close your eyes and take a
deep breath now imagine you&#39;re sitting
in a college class on computer
programming and the professor just
walked in picture the Facebook post of a
friend congratulating a couple who just
adopted a baby visualize your state
swearing-in a new governor now open your
eyes and raise your hand if your mental
image differs substantially now than it
did at the beginning of this talk that
earlier brain exercise we did is
something I do at the start of most
investor meetings it&#39;s my way of
tricking them into examining their own
behavior but it&#39;s also how I consciously
turn the unexpected into the expected
before we get to the point in my pitch
where I share with them that when we
complete a series a around adventure
financing the chief financial officer
we&#39;re bringing on board is black and the
story of my company starts with two
happily married men and the CEO of this
year&#39;s hottest tech startup looks
exactly like me
you
