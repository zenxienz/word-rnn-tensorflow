it&#39;s a shame that neither of us can fit
in the ex it&#39;s probably me being too big
so bridge is really important to me
coming from Wales obviously I used to
use the bridge to get here but the song
about singing is ain&#39;t no mountain high
enough and for me it has two meanings in
a mountain high F is for me to come to
Dora and visit her when I can when I&#39;m
not at school or working to get money to
pay to come and see her although he
doesn&#39;t have to pay it across the bridge
and I do but it also has a second
meaning it&#39;s ain&#39;t no mountain high
enough for me there&#39;s nothing that we
can&#39;t reach if we try hard enough and
like all of you have said today hard
work does pay off and when it does you
can build that bridge
