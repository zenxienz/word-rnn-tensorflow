my name is will de Bruin and I&#39;m a
hospice volunteer I provide
companionship for terminally ill
patients with less than six months to
live one of my favorite quotes comes
from the novel The Great Gatsby I was
both within and without enchanted and
repelled by the inexhaustible variety of
life
this quote perfectly describes what it&#39;s
like to be a hospice volunteer you&#39;re
intimately drawn into a very personal
situation but you&#39;re still an outsider
because you can never truly understand
what a dying person is going through in
addition because death is a very
personal transition you there&#39;s an
inexhaustible variety in death because
each death is as varied as the human
races because of this each patient has
taught me something different and
influenced my life in a different way
time is a relative thing it can fly by
when you&#39;re having fun with your friends
or it can seem to drag on forever for
example when I was a kid I remember
going to bed on Christmas Eve night
Paden I would never sleep that night at
that and I would drag on forever and
ever because I couldn&#39;t wait to open up
my gifts the next morning one thing I&#39;ve
noticed this time seems to go quicker
when you get older and one of the most
impactful conversations I ever had with
a patient was about this phenomenon this
patient they were not necessarily
putting together comprehensible thoughts
every single day and that&#39;s fairly
common at the end of life because you
know whether it&#39;s due to the disease
process or various medications they&#39;re
on they&#39;re often you know but we were
sitting there and we were just watching
the world go by outside the window and
the patient turned to me and I could
tell through their gestures that they
had something very important to say time
goes quicker when you get older I
replied I understand that I I&#39;m just
finishing up my freshman year of college
and it flew by
I it feels like I just moved in
yesterday time going quicker is a
merciful thing it means the suffering
going quicker or the suffering goes
quicker to the patient then turned to me
with tears in their eyes and said don&#39;t
get old we wept together unconcerned
time moved on slowly from one of us too
quickly for the other in a different
place in a different time I visited
another patient who had a
neurodegenerative disorder that left
them paralyzed from the neck down you
know that a lot of diseases can cause
that but they all have one thing in
common and that&#39;s the need for complete
dependence on others for the patient&#39;s
care and patients really seem to so this
patient and I we we had a connection we
talked a lot and we got pretty close
usually you can tell when a patient&#39;s
gonna die because they stop eating they
stop drinking they sleep a lot more they
start to fade away and with this death
caught me by surprise and I will never
forget the day after I found out about

the death I had to get up at 5:30 a.m.
my alarm was blaring I&#39;m a collegiate
athlete we have workouts in the morning
and these workouts they are not fun at
all
um it&#39;s in the dead of winter - out on
the field and you&#39;ll go from like
sweating and running and then you&#39;ll
stop your hair freeze I couldn&#39;t run my
hands in my head this morning was
different I was thankful I was thankful
that I could few of the cold winter air
and my nose and burning in my lungs I
was thankful that I can move my legs and
feel the pain because that payment I was
alive I am young my heart is beating and
I&#39;m alive these small blessings often
overlooked
really do mean the most however just
because we appreciate the small
blessings in life doesn&#39;t mean that the
big victories are any less sweet I&#39;ll
never forget we beat my high school
rivals in a JV football game by a
last-second field goal and my coach said
something very impactful after you said
there&#39;s nothing quite like winning a
high school football game when you get
old you experience this feeling less
often it fades away so appreciate it
while you have it you experience it
maybe when you propose someone when you
love you&#39;ll experience it when you hold
your child in your arms for the first
time but you never experience it as
often when you get old in life things
get taken from you you lose friendships
you lose relationships but you move on
and you grow as a person but this moment
this moment is forever so I want you to
take your teammates yeah I want you to
take your teammates hand in yours look
them in the eye and put them in your
heart forever because forever just
happened over the summer I volunteered
at a inpatient care facility serving
breakfast to patients once a week and I
would always have time I&#39;d always make a
point of talking to each patient and
getting to know them but it was hard
because each week when I came back a
different room was empty another
relationship was severed these empty
rooms really came to symbolize what
death meant to me it was cold it was
final it was clinical however reflecting
on my experiences and thinking about
what my coach said these patients and
their impact on me despite the fact that
they were dead it still mattered it&#39;s
still lasted in a way they were immortal
because they were in my heart forever
and in the hearts of their family
members so I encourage you the love is
deeply and as often as you can
take every moment and appreciate it
because each moment is a blessing and
never fail to make a positive impact in
somebody&#39;s life if you are given the
opportunity
thank you
