dance thanks this is loom
hello this is Dario and this is Duncan
thanks
so here we are is a brand new project
for community settings so this is quite
a different environment for us we&#39;ve
been exploring the theme of change
through improvised contemporary dance we
were inspired by something called
playback theater and playback theater is
a tradition that&#39;s been going for over
40 years and it&#39;s practiced all over the
world in our interpretation of the form
what happens is somebody from the
audience one of you fantastic people
will share a story about a moment in
your life something that you&#39;ve
experienced personally and then that
will be done with a little bit of help
from Lulu there and then Duncan will
choose a piece of music and Dario and I
are going to dance that story back

planning no rehearsals just a commitment
from all of us to be here in this moment

Oh brilliant yeah she&#39;s like 20 okay I&#39;m
most connected all right okay so in your
packs you might have had this which is a
little card and on this has a question
what moment or person has changed your
perspective there might have been a
moment in your life where your
perspective has changed or something
changed in you and that made your
perspective change when I watch Brenna
Browns TED talk about the power of
vulnerability amazing if anybody heard
of that one
of course if you haven&#39;t watch it that
changed me and about being my
perspective on my vulnerability and
right now I&#39;m definitely stepping into
my favorability so we might ask some
people about their own stories earlier
and when we were milling in the lobby
and I heard some beautiful stories and I
asked them what their titles would be
and Lindsey are you out here okay great
her title would have been family lives
or family&#39;s lives I wonder what that
story would have been and we had marette
okay her story was sometimes you&#39;re in
the right place and then we had a story
from Hannah beautiful really touched me
and her she would have called her story
my mom won&#39;t be at my wedding
I can relate and then Barry where are
you Barry
he said his story would have been hot
sex in the moment so if only we could
hear that story now and don&#39;t sit back
but we&#39;re not going to don&#39;t wait okay
you can&#39;t hear that story okay so but
what we have done is because this is a
really big ass for somebody to come out
of the audience and tell their story on
stage at TEDx Purim we&#39;ve kind of
already got somebody that&#39;s agreed to do
it earlier so karo
you&#39;re going to come to the stage can we
give Tower a really big warm round of
applause no I just want to say that
Dario and Becca haven&#39;t met Carrie they
haven&#39;t heard her story and here she is
babe okay so come and take a seat with
me okay so what what moment or person
has changed your perspective in some way
and welcome to the stage thank you my
story is quite quite a simple one but
one that has definitely had a big impact
on me when I was 16 and I&#39;m German I&#39;ve
grown up in Germany and being a second
language speaker and I I wanted to learn
good English improve my English but not
only that I wanted to go on an adventure
I had the chance to go to live in the
States for a year and live with a family
there go to high school and I&#39;ve had so
many experiences there that has changed
me but there was one specific one about
learning the language surely having
school English I made lots of mistakes
along the way and I wanted to improve my
English and third dad of the family that
I lived with he would always point out
the things that I did wrong in the
language and being 16 a teenager may be
grumpy sometimes about that or quite
offensive and he quickly caught on that
I didn&#39;t like him correcting me very
much and there was a moment he took me
to the side and just explained to me you
know I&#39;m here to help you I really want
you to learn that in
and that&#39;s why I&#39;m correcting you and
clearly that made sense to me
even though before I I didn&#39;t really
like him correcting me but I did at the
same time just him saying that really
changed my perspective to try in a brace
all those Corrections I got okay so you
so let me get this right so you had a
relationship with a teacher and how did
you feel just just gives really give
those feeling qualities of how you felt
when he was correcting you well I guess
I got very defensive very quickly I
probably reacted sometimes I was but
still he could clearly tell I wasn&#39;t I
didn&#39;t like very much being being
corrected like that wonderful not
wonderful that you felt vulnerable but
it&#39;s a great story and how did you feel
when your perspective had changed how
did you feel and used to come really to
embrace and correction of briefs and
criticism not always it&#39;s not always
that easy okay
but it&#39;s really opened me up to learning
and general great all right thank you
for your story I wish we had more time
but we don&#39;t miss headaches the clock is
ticking and you got enough okay let&#39;s
get ready
and let&#39;s watch
