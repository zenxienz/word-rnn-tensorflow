we live in a really small world
but even so sometimes finding a new job
opportunity or tapping into new
knowledge can be an impossible task I&#39;m
gonna help you with that
so I&#39;m Nikki and I&#39;m a recovering
Network scientist I see networks
everywhere
in fact I think that my brain has been
hardwired to find connections between
people you may have heard about the six
degrees of separation theory which
essentially means that everybody in this
world is connected to everyone else by
just six steps just six but how does
this translate to real life well I grew
up in Cyprus and Cyprus has a population
of one point one seven million people so
the interesting question here is how
many degrees of separation do you think
there are between myself and every other
Cypriot on the island okay let&#39;s do some
basic math and I&#39;ll show you how to get
to the answer so I assume that when I
went to primary school I made 35 people
and then I went to secondary school and
I made 35 different people and then
let&#39;s just say when I went to university
I made 35 people more this brings us to
a grand total of 105 people so if the
average separate has 105 people that
they know of how many degrees do you
think it will take for me to get to
everyone so this is me and one degree
away are the 105 people that I know
directly if we go out one more degree
that will be at 2 degrees of separation
that&#39;s 105 multiplied by 105 and let&#39;s
go out one more degree so at 3 degrees
of separation that will be 105
multiplied by 105 multiplied by 105
again and
number comes to one point one six
million people does this sound familiar
very quickly within just three degrees
of separation I managed to get to
everybody in the whole of Cyprus not six
just three and then you may wonder in
your everyday life do you really need to
reach everybody in this world or do you
even need to reach everybody in your own
country or are you interacting this much
smaller world and if so is there a way
that you can network more effectively in
order to minimize the degrees of
separation between yourselves and
everybody you&#39;ll need bridges help us
navigate the world that we live in how
much of a bridge Simone is is actually a
very well-known measure in the network
science world and it&#39;s called the
betweenness centrality the betweenness
centrality is calculated by looking at
every single pair of people in the
network finding the minimum paths
between them and then assessing how many
of these pass through each person so
someone with a high betweenness
centrality will have many paths joining
people but will also be the person that
connects different communities and
connects people within their communities
so what you can do is have a look in
your everyday life so this is me in my
community a and let&#39;s say that&#39;s my work
community I&#39;m a data scientist at the
government digital service and I
regularly interact with other data
scientists policy people governance
people and so on but let&#39;s assume that I
need to get to community B let&#39;s say
that&#39;s an industry where they&#39;re
producing their brand-new machine
learning algorithm that I really need to
get my hands on I can have a look around
in my network and see who are my bridges
who are the people with the highest
betweenness centrality that can get me
from the community I mean in the one
that I&#39;m not currently present in but in
fact today people aren&#39;t just connected
by personal relationships or by
relationships they connected by ideas
and interests and beliefs and for this
reason with a bunch of friends I set up
dated beers London
you heard right I said beer dated beers
London and the idea behind this is that
anybody who has an interesting data
story to tell no matter what the
technical background can come together
and share this story and they can learn
from each other of course having the
free beer helps but data stories come
flooding in from industry from academia
from government and from the arts people
come together to share about what data
science and what data and visualizations
go on in their own domain and then learn
from each other but data beers isn&#39;t
just a London thing the idea has spread
all over the world and in fact with just
this one idea we&#39;re connecting people
across boundaries across the oceans
everyone is learning from each other
based on just this one interest one idea
that we had isn&#39;t that amazing
think of how many interests do you have
how many ideas you have that can connect
you to other people networks aren&#39;t
these static things they&#39;re actually
living organisms and they need to be
nurtured have a think about your network
and have a thing of how you can change
it to shape your career goals or your
personal goals
be proactive actively build your bridges
and actively find them when you need
them and you never know where they&#39;ll
take you thank you
