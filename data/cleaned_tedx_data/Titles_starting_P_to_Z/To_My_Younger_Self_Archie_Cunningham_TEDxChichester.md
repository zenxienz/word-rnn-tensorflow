okay
my name is Archie and today when I was
thinking about what I wanted to talk
about I was thinking about the time that
I was kind of 17 18 19 just starting out
and hopefully while saving would be
useful to someone who&#39;s in a similar
situation to me I was someone that was
always interested in personal government
I was a very gracious reader all the
things that were stood outside of my
subject area that I was meant to be
studying school and where I am now I&#39;m a
husband I&#39;ve got two kids I&#39;m 20 years
old I own a gym and I wouldn&#39;t be here
today if I hadn&#39;t fought some certain
principles that kind of helped me get
there and I felt but I feel very
strongly and actually what&#39;s become
today very relevant very similar to all
of the things that helped me get to this
point
yep instead of working for a guess but
definitely have some things to pass on
so I&#39;ll tell a story I was 23 years old
and I decided that I was going to get
married and I was going to get married
to my club wife who was a bit older than
me and I was realized that the odds were
somewhat against me in many different
facets didn&#39;t have a job and I was by
you that this was absolutely something
that I don&#39;t thought I thought I just
had to do and I remember the phone call
that was pretty awkward to these my
wife&#39;s dad going right I would like to
speak to you and summary to you what was
happen to happen so he said about coming
and so I
Hopson he had to teach that they doubt
he had the cake on our table I&#39;ve
everybody distinctively and I sat there
and squirmed for about well at least a
couple of minutes and he kind of many
half way and said so is there anything
you would like to to to AH to me yes I
would like to marry your daughter and
and there was a moment then that I went
white and he then said well I&#39;m
delighted and and then well the rest is
history
but a lot happened and the principle of
Highness was seeking out this kind of
awkward conversation and it was very
scary again thinking about anything that
was it begin to me but I knew that I had
to do this in all that if I was progress
and and this has kind of been a theme
that&#39;s run throughout everything I&#39;ve
got done up until now there&#39;s been
seeking out these kind of uncomfortable
moments I&#39;m sure everyone&#39;s kind of
experience that that conversation you
don&#39;t want to have with someone or you
know you&#39;ve got to do something you just
really don&#39;t want to do and this is very
very much of a theme in terms of
achieving anything but how I&#39;ve been
told that age 15-16 I think that would
hopefully have been able to progress a
little bit faster and I think that
certainly talking about the actually
going and finding these these kind of
awkward things that we really want to
that we really want to go and do or that
we know we need to do but we can&#39;t
avoiding is crucial to your growth and
no matter what the outcome has been for
any of the conversations I&#39;ll give you
another example so I sat down with one
of my oldest members added him and that
I run I was going to practically doubled
his pricing overnight but I knew I had
to do it because I was having to provide
for my family and I had to make make
ends meet so I had to charge and value
myself enough and I sat down with him
and I was again equally as afraid by the
conversation went well and you know kind
of sat there you know all right so you
got so so it&#39;s harsh nice past month
right okay that&#39;s fine well or
especially go get some new kit that way
okay fine done so and we got it sorted
and what are the things that have
happened since then that meant that it
was more challenging than the business
and I had people leave and the
atmosphere that Jim certainly changed
for me it&#39;s a lot better now and I think
that regardless of whatever you&#39;re
trying to go after these are all
conversations and fundamentals that
growth and it&#39;s really really important
to think about that so so this is kind
of where I want to progress toward
valuing of interests so certainly when
you&#39;re looking at kids that are kind of
growing up now we&#39;re preparing the
things that were not even sure what kind
of careers they&#39;re going to be doing I
never

19:17 would have thought that I&#39;d be a
gym owner and a coach at this point in
my life and that was because I the job
didn&#39;t really exist
certainly within within this area it&#39;s
really really crucial that we&#39;re
educating our kids to be curious because
everything I&#39;m applying to helping
people learn now we&#39;ve got some diets
with regards
- you know behavioral change is all to
do with I was reading outside of all the
subjects that I was studying and it was
super because I wasn&#39;t really aware
there&#39;s actually something up to make
money and I think there&#39;s really really
crucial first certainly for younger kids
that we want to be able to we really
really want to be listening to what
their interests are don&#39;t go and ask
them what they want to do you need girls
more interested in because that was what
I would have benefited from when I was
that age and the last thing it sort of
is I did not giving up and they&#39;ve been
movements that you might think that
sorry my mouth is very drying there grab
some water
my juice can I just do that because
otherwise I mean he probably right one
of the things that I years ago I bought
my business plan around
I&#39;ve only been eighteen months in
business and this was kind of a dive
duck-and-cover
kind of thing so I spent about six
months thinking about it and then about
a week writing email and then ended up
hurt my wife rewriter because it was no
good
and then and then I hit Send and then
just literally kind of put my head down
and wasn&#39;t really sure what to do and I
opened the whole can of worms and in the
end oh well I wasn&#39;t able my promises
and and this kind of led to her very
much sort of bidding war between me and
my business partner at the time I
thought I was going to lose everything
I literally did I didn&#39;t have any job
prospects I had we just had a newborn as
two small boys and my wife couldn&#39;t
really work she was absolutely doing the
best but it was very much down to me to
hold up the end of the bargain and
provide for them and I there were
moments when I did think that you know
what&#39;s the point I could give up on this
and just sell the other half him and be
done with it I wouldn&#39;t know what to do
and it was only that last extra kind of
step that I took that maze that all the
difference
actually a spy gym and we&#39;re still
growing and we have great numbers and
it&#39;s one of the most fulfilling jobs
that I&#39;ve ever done I couldn&#39;t think of
anything else that I&#39;d rather do and
yeah so the holidays basically just keep
going and that&#39;s what I tell my clients
you know if you fail your diet you know
how many times you do everyone&#39;s
probably fails that their their diet at
some point or try to lose weight get
fitter and I work with this on a daily
basis but the difference that it makes
in terms of achieving something and not
it&#39;s just the ability to keep going it
doesn&#39;t matter how hard or how many
times you fail just take that extra step
and and you&#39;ll get that so anyway but
thank you so much for letting me be here
and yeah I hope that it&#39;s been something
useful - yeah
