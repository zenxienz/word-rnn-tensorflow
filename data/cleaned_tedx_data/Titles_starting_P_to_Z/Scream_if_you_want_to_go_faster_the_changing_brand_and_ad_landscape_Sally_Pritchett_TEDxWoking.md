change is human it&#39;s big it&#39;s small it&#39;s
fast
and it&#39;s slow I think of it a bit like
one of my favorite buildings in London
big ben when you stand on the pavement
next to big ben and you look up it
towers into the sky is huge but as soon
as you walk across Westminster Bridge it
contextualizes with this the skyline and
it sort of shrinks if you were to take a
helicopter over London actually Big
Ben&#39;s a bit of a baby in comparison to
Canary Wharf and the shard and even the
gherkin and if you take a satellite
image of London it would be miniscule
when I think about all the change that&#39;s
happened in my life from one generation
of me growing up to my children now
growing up the change feels vast if I
take a simple thing like doing my
homework around the kitchen table when I
was a child I would have sat with a pen
and paper doing my homework at the
kitchen table the one and only
television in our house was in the
sitting room I wasn&#39;t missing much from
the kitchen because there were only
three channels the fourth channel four
didn&#39;t come along until I was twelve and
anyway the TV sometimes had something
called the test card so for anyone
younger than me their test card happened
when there was actually nothing on the
TV difficult to imagine that there were
times where it was not 24/7 365 I didn&#39;t
have a phone at the kitchen table
because the one and only phone was in
the hall you had to actually sit on a
funny kind of table chair thing because
it was wired into the wall so a
telephone call was a telephone call and
besides it was pretty cold in the hall
for some reason the heating never made
its way to the hall and I find now watch
my children sitting around my kitchen
table doing their homework they will not
have a pen and paper because they will
be using their laptop to upload their
homework to the school portal they will
have their phone on the table maybe even
more what them
one of them because they will be
checking their Instagram they will be
receiving snapchats and what&#39;s happing
somebody else they will have their
tablets playing some music and for some
unknown reason we also have to have the
television on blaring in the background
playing one of the zillions of channels
that are available to them now on top of
this there is one similarity to me in my
childhood which is they will be
bickering as well holding down a
conversation beer all fragmented and
that will be going on on top of
everything so it feels like a vast
change then why is it that I am my
mother and I don&#39;t mean a little bit my
mother I mean every day my mother pick
up your feet hang it up put your hand
over your mouth when you cough what&#39;s
the magic word sit up straight don&#39;t
drag your tails were you born in a barn
I am my mother so what&#39;s the impact of
this change yet no change on brands I
suspect if you go home tonight and look
in your cupboards your bathroom cabinets
your bedside tables your fridges you
will find more brands that your parents
enjoyed and your grandparents enjoyed
then you might think in fact if I was to
look at breakfast I get up and have
breakfast today the same as I did as a
young person as a young person my cereal
choices were completely influenced by a
big furry honey monster and a tiger
called Tony and after cereal we had
toast
and my father was a lover and my father
my mother was a hater of course I&#39;m not
talking about the state of their
marriage I am talking about Marmite my
mother would have drunk tea Tetley&#39;s or
PG tipps
and my father coffee so Nescafe or Kenko
and today at my breakfast table no
matter how much I want to reduce sugar
in my household because I know that to
be a good thing now my children&#39;s tastes
are influenced by a big furry honey
monster and
Tyger called Tony I am still a lover my
husband now a hater so we have spawned a
mixture of two I now drink tea PG tipps
intently my husband coffee Kenko and
Nescafe you could say that breakfast
just got off easy because it&#39;s untouched
by the digital revolution so let&#39;s look
at a category like playing for our
children you can&#39;t tell me that we have
not been touched there by the technical
revolution but if we are to believe that
our children have to be completely
plugged into devices 24/7 then surely
their bedrooms and play rooms would be
completely void of a single toy so why
is it then that all over my house I
tread on Lego my house is as full of
Lego today as my childhood house was and
I could go on I brush my teeth with
Colgate I wash my dishes with fairy I
wash my clothes with Ariel and Percel
obviously when it comes to chocolate its
Cadbury&#39;s but on Christmas Day we have
to have quality streets and Toblerone is
really for those special days so is it
really the case there actually every
brand that we knew and loved fits from
one generation to the next actually know
there are some gaps and there are some
brands that are missing that haven&#39;t
transitioned through the generations
they&#39;re harder to remember because of
course they&#39;re now longer no they&#39;re no
longer front of mind so actually it&#39;s
not always because that category isn&#39;t
relevant if I consider something like
watching the movies at home and I&#39;m not
talking the cinema but I&#39;m talking those
sleepovers I had with my girlfriends
when I was a teenager
- the family film nights we have now
snuggled up on our sofas okay as a child
I might have had to trip down to a video
shop and choose the film off a shelf and
now I can download it but it didn&#39;t need
to be the case that it was with
blockbusters and it is of course now
with Netflix and Amazon Prime I&#39;m sure
my children are listening to as much
music if not
or than when I was a child maybe I had
to tape it off my off the radio and bit
panicky if in the middle it changed the
tape had to be turned around but of
course those brands like our price and
HMV are no longer how we&#39;re listening to
our music and okay so maybe these are
categories where the digital revolution
again has really impacted them but if I
take something else like even a yogurt
and I say actually the yogurt industry
looks as if it&#39;s alive and well just
like it was when I was a child if you go
into a supermarket you still see a
plethora of yogurts but no longer ski
like I did as a child so there are
brands that we liked in fact in fact
your reaction tells me that you now
reminisce about those brands but they
don&#39;t no longer with us so why is that
why do some brands manage to transition
from one generation to the next and
others don&#39;t I believe there&#39;s a
combination of three things at play at
the moment the first is that we&#39;ve got
product manufacture that means that with
globalization we can now make products
from a prototype to a product on a shelf
very very quickly cheaply and easily and
this combined with a complete change to
the route to market you no longer have
to have a chain of high street stores or
beg the buyers of a supermarket or a
department store to put your product on
their shelves
you can now place your unknown product
unknown brand in a online marketplace or
even set up your own e-commerce shop and
you can be up and running quickly and
easily and it&#39;s these two things
combined with the third thing which is
the access to advertising no longer with
TV being king is this purely for the
exclusive big rich brands that could
advertise now we&#39;ve leveled the playing
field so these small unknown brands now
have a chance to not only produce their
products and put it on a shelf but also
get out to their market and this has
been a game changer what it&#39;s caused is
an unexpected
explosion in market pressure I kind of
imagined that maybe back in 1998 around
that time someone piped up in a board
meeting in Cadbury somewhere excuse me
do you think we should pay any attention
to this little niche organic chocolate
that&#39;s come up called green and blacks
I&#39;d like to think that someone took that
person seriously but maybe someone
laughed and went with Cadbury&#39;s only to
find not long later that they were
sharing every shelf in every supermarket
with green and ranks I&#39;ve just started
my Christmas shopping which I&#39;m quite
pleased about for this year and I don&#39;t
know about many of you but I&#39;m gonna be
buying gin this year I think a lot of
people will be buying gin it&#39;s just a
bit ala mode this year but I have just
as much chance that I&#39;m going to be
buying locally produced silent Paul gin
as I am two hundred and forty
eight-year-old Gordon&#39;s brand gin and
suddenly that two hundred and fifty
years almost of history to Gordon&#39;s has
little to play for in terms of the
future of silent pool versus Gordon&#39;s so
let&#39;s go back to breakfast for a moment
is it really true that breakfast is
completely on affected by this market
pressure ok the digital revolution
hasn&#39;t hit the cereal oil but when I
walk into these massive supermarkets
that we have now and see cereal for an
entire aisle from floor to ceiling
gluten-free this high fiber that low
sugar this granola that granola this and
actually that&#39;s before we even consider
some of the little trends I don&#39;t know
if anyone and allianz this year with
avocado on toast my mother would&#39;ve
looked at me like I was crazy if I&#39;d
have asked for that as a child but of
course cereal has had that kind of
pressure just like all of the other
categories and you couldn&#39;t possibly
tell me that Lego has not had market
pressure for getting all the online
games if you just took
brand that gave them a run for their
money this generation which was
minecraft so come on kids you don&#39;t need
it physically build it with plastic you
can do it in the virtual world how does
a brand like Lego not just survive a
generation but shine
seriously shine and so this is where I
like to have a bit of fun and I like to
imagine the top execs of a brand like
Lego marching up to Big Ben staring up
at this towering change and saying okay
so the kids today want to watch YouTube
videos well then we will bring Lego to
life in YouTube videos we will have lego
ninjago LEGO Friends Lego City we will
bring the Lego to life and reimagine
Lego for children of today and if you&#39;re
telling me that kids today really feel
that the most relevant thing to them is
these huge franchises like Star Wars and
Harry Potter well then we will make Star
Wars and Harry Potter Lego and we will
stay relevant and if you&#39;re telling me
that kids today have forgotten how to
play and they can&#39;t really see what
where their imagination is then we&#39;ll
make a movie that explains to kids
and literally demonstrates to them how
to play and maybe in another boardroom
further down the road because obviously
they&#39;re next door the Topix X of a brand
like Marmite are also stomping up to Big
Ben and they&#39;re looking up and they&#39;re
saying right so it&#39;s not good enough
anymore that we just sell our product we
have to have a two-way communication we
have to have social media we have to
have a community of fans well this is a
bit of a problem because there are some
people that don&#39;t really like Marmite in
fact they don&#39;t really like the smell of
it but what would happen if we just
talked to everybody whether you loved us
or you hated us and if you weren&#39;t sure
we&#39;ll get you to taste it
and we&#39;ll tell you DNA tell you that you
hate us so this is fun but I think these
brands also walked back over Westminster
Bridge and looked back at that towering
change and did another important thing
they put it into context and they said
but let&#39;s just remember if we&#39;re Lego
our job is not to make YouTube videos of
Lego our purpose as a brand is to
inspire children to to build and to
imagine and create and that&#39;s actually
our destination the rest is part of the
journey what would have happened if
blockbusters had walked back across
Westminster Bridge would we be
downloading our movies from there now so
I can&#39;t really imagine in the world of
AI and VR what changes my children are
going to be reflecting on in 40 years
time I literally cannot imagine but I do
like to think I might leave them a bit
of a legacy and whether they like it or
not I&#39;d like to think of them in their
houses with their children in a few
years time saying sit up straight
don&#39;t don&#39;t scrape your feet on the
floor what are we say yes you may get
down from the table hang it up you were
born in a barn and I will leave my
legacy like that change is human
