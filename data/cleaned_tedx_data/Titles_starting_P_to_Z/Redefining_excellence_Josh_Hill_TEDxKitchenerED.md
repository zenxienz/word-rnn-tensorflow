well it was spring 2014 and I just taken
my senior Wind Ensemble to the local
music festival competition and my
seniors had played a nearly flawless
performance of some very advanced level
high school repertoire and as a result
the adjudicator had awarded them the top
prize given out by the festival the
award for the best ensemble and in that
moment I was undoubtedly proud of my
students but unexpectedly there was also
the sense of emptiness that followed and
I recall thinking on the bus ride back
to the school that night that if this
was everything we had worked towards if
this was it then I was missing something
I believe we live in a society and that
I teach in an educational system that
has an unhealthy infatuation with
competition and the pursuit of
individualized excellence and you don&#39;t
need it and you don&#39;t need to look very
far in the high school system to see how
this plays out we give our highest
scholarships to our top academic
achievers we push our athletes our
musicians our Chess Club players our
deca Club participants to be the best
and we even design competitions where we
can show our students without a shadow
of a doubt who is first and who was last
who was best and who was worst and all
the while I believe we ignore the
tremendous amount of stress anxiety and
pressure that we heap on to our students
and I believe we ignore the resulting
system where countless high school
students walked the hallways of our
buildings every single day feeling a
profound sense of disconnection
isolation and loneliness they choose to
function on the margins of the community
afraid to engage because they&#39;re
terrified that they just won&#39;t measure
up but I believe our society functions
in a similar way so let me ask you the
question when&#39;s the last time you
declined the opportunity to participate
in an activity with others because you
were afraid you would measure up that
you might be judge
by those around you and we developed
these great little catchphrases like you
know what I&#39;d love to sing but I&#39;m
actually tone-deaf or I could you said
that before I or I don&#39;t have an
athletic bone in my body and another
common whenever it is you know I&#39;d help
but I don&#39;t even know which end of the
hammer to pick up and these catchphrases
are highly effective in keeping us on
the sidelines away from the judgment of
others but sadly they also prevent us
from experiencing the deep sense of
belonging that comes when we know that
we belong to others and I think it&#39;s
actually a byproduct of a society that
at its core doesn&#39;t really value the
communal expressions of participation we
seem to say that the quality of the
activity or the level of the participant
matters more than the relational
belonging that&#39;s formed when we
participate together and I think it
helps to explain a little bit at least
in part the feeling that something was
missing when I left that festival in
2014 because if I&#39;m really honest with
myself along the way I had started to
buy into that traditional model of
excellence and to push my students hard
towards the competition and in so doing
I started to use my students as a
vehicle to pursue a musical goal versus
using music as the vehicle to create
inclusive spaces of belonging for my
students and the one elevates the
quality of the activity and the other
elevates the individual their well-being
their belonging and ultimately their
sense of empowerment that matters most
and I want to see a movement in
education where we leave behind those
traditional models of excellence and
instead forge a courageous new path
towards excellence as defined by shared
engagement relational connectedness
community collaboration where ultimately
our success is determined by the quality
and the impact of the human interaction
and our ability to be of service to each
other now maybe you think this sounds a
bit wishy-washy or touchy-feely or maybe
you&#39;re wondering about what this
actually looks like in practice and in
part I hope to answer that last question
through the illustration of one of the
projects of our music program but before
I get there let me first help to set the
context a little bit for our journey
because it was when my colleagues and I
in our department began to think more
mystically about our role as educators
when we began to consider the human need
for belonging to know others and be
known in return when we began to tackle
the tough question of what it might look
like for high school music program to
have something to say about social
justice in our community and when we
began to dream of creating inclusive
spaces of belonging for students where
they would be empowered to live lives of
significance in the world it&#39;s then that
we realized we needed to leave behind
those traditional models of excellence
and instead to shift our purpose towards
excellence that&#39;s measured through
relational belonging and one of the
projects in our music program that&#39;s
helping us to live these values is
called the circle of music and this is a
project where we bring together youth
from our music program and we pair them
with the senior and her community who&#39;s
living with dementia and along with
their caregiver they meet each week and
over juice and cookies they dig into
each other&#39;s lives they get caught up on
the week and they just build
relationships and then that&#39;s followed
by a large group time of singing where
community is fostered through the
creation of art and then again before
the time finishes is the opportunity for
their participants to socialize and this
is a project that&#39;s a joint project
between the Cameron Heights music
program the kW Alzheimer&#39;s Society merit
a masters and community music graduate
from Wilfrid Laurier University and st.
Peter&#39;s Lutheran Church which hosts the
event each week but before I say too
much more about how the circle of music
is helping us to redefine excellence I
want us to experience the circle of
music at least a little taste of the
circle of music here tonight so as I
invite my friends to come and join us on
stage I just want to be clear with you
that what&#39;s about to unfold tonight is
not a performance this is not intended
for you to sit in your chairs and to
passively consume but rather this is an
open invitation to each of you to be an
active engaged participant with us as we
sing so I&#39;m gonna need you to turn off
that voice in your head that&#39;s used to
saying that you&#39;re tone-deaf and you
can&#39;t sing and I&#39;m going to need you to
society voice that says that you
shouldn&#39;t sing because the people around
you are going to judge you and instead I
want you to take a risk I want you to
imagine that you&#39;re sitting on stage
next to one of these seniors or one of
these youth experiencing the deep sense
of joy that comes when we know that we
belong and so before I turn it over to
Sasha doodles and Kelly who is our
projects coordinator for the circle of
music I just want to say that when we
finished singing tonight you are welcome
to applaud but please don&#39;t applaud as
if this was some performance that you
watched applaud rather in celebration of
the moment that were about to share
together or applaud in celebration of
the relationships that have formed
between these seniors in these youths
over the last year of the the circle of
music project are you ready
great let&#39;s sing together tonight
[Applause]

[Music]
hey hey hey hey
Oh
[Music]
beautiful
the circle of music is an experience
that just simply wouldn&#39;t exist in our
program if we were following those
traditional models of excellence and we
would lose out on the opportunity to
create community between diverse groups
of people at its core I believe that
competition in the pursuit of
individualized excellence actually
fractures relationships and when we
prioritize technical prescribed outcomes
we disempower community stakeholders and
the circle of music it&#39;s the kind of
experience where regardless of whether
the singing is excellent or not on a
given Thursday music remains the
facilitator of something that&#39;s so much
greater for intergenerational
communities to be forged for spaces of
mentorship and support to flourish and
for the hearts and minds of our students
to be opened up to the possibility of
creating relationships with people that
are vastly different than them
relationships that are founded on the
values of empathy kindness and respect
values I believe we can all agree our
world desperately needs more of right
now in our culture at Cameron Heights we
resist the notion that we need to foster
the culture of competition and
individualize excellence for the sake of
preparing our students for a tough and
competitive world rather I believe it is
our responsibility as educators to
create spaces of inclusion and belonging
for students where they can ultimately
be empowered to be difference makers in
the world shaping the world into a place
where the norm becomes seniors living
with dementia meeting to build
relationships with youth in our program
we use music as the vehicle to push
after this kind of social change in the
world and the stories of hope and life
transformation that are emerging are
beautiful and deeply inspiring but I
believe that the concepts I&#39;m sharing
with you tonight are broad and I
actually get shivers thinking about what
it would look like for each one of you
gathered here tonight in your own ways
to begin to implement these ideas in the
communities that you belong to because
the reality is this there are too many
people in our society who live on the
sidelines who feel relegated to the
margins and they desperately want and
need a space where they can belong but
they are terrified that they just don&#39;t
match
and they believe that who they are isn&#39;t
good enough they need a connector
someone like you or someone like me
who&#39;s going to be willing to invite them
off of the sidelines to pull them from
their spaces on the margins and welcome
them into communities where excellence
is defined by the quality and the impact
of the human interaction and our ability
to be of service to each other
I believe our society needs connectors
now more than it ever has before and so
tonight I leave you with one final
question will you join me in the
difficult but rewarding work of
redefining excellence in our community
thank you
[Applause]
