Emotion is a complex set
of chemical and neuronal responses
characterized by a stimulation
or disturbance
that predisposes to an organized response.
The immediate result to this response
is a temporary change
in the state of the body itself.
The final result is placing the organism
in circumstances suitable
for its survival and well-being.
These responses are automatic.
(Stomping and clapping)
Sorry for not knowing the script by heart.
It&#39;s not that I haven&#39;t prepared the talk,
but I have a bit of dyslexia,
a bit of attention deficit,
and, in fact, it is very difficult for me,
well, it&#39;s the cool thing to say,
especially if you&#39;re an artist, right?
So I find it really difficult
to memorize words,
or reading, concentrating.
The only thing I memorize
are movements and emotions.
But I would like to read this text

from Pascal Quignard for you, that says:
&quot;Music doesn&#39;t dwell
in the most beautiful instruments.
Neither it dwells in the worst of them.
The most suitable instruments
for music are, without a doubt,
those that move but are perishable,
like the bodies that involve mankind.&quot;

Purity:
Quality of pure.
That one free and exempt
of any mixture of another thing,
not including any condition,
exception or restriction of any period
or that is exempt of moral imperfections.
(Heavy breathing)
Well, now that I see myself...
(Heavy breathing)
it could be considered
that I&#39;m an impure flamenco dancer,
furthermore, full of moral imperfections,

(Laughter)
 (Heavy breathing)
That&#39;s right.
Could anyone in the room tell me
if they are morally perfect,
or if they are pure?
Raise your hand, please.
(Silence)
Just what I was afraid of.
(Tapping)
Take it, take, ah.
The problem for me is
that women, for example,
are supposed to shake their hips
from side to side, you know?
Wiggling, seducing with movement,
but I don&#39;t get it right, to be honest...

(Laughter)

I prefer to move it
forwards and backwards,
more like men do, or should do.

(Laughter)

Well, sometimes I just mix it, too.

(Laughter)

(Stomping)

(Laughter)

Flamenco dancer!
&quot;Boquerona!&quot; A native of MÃ¡laga.
Boxer, creator, body, woman, impure,
passionate, frisky, bland,
annoying when necessary,
shameless, imperfect,
incorrect, unstoppable!
(Clapping)
Less gypsy than an olive tree!
(Stomping)
I do not evolve.
I am.

(Applause)
