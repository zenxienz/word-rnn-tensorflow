thanks for having me my name is Lauren
I&#39;m the founder of the insane and
material alchemist I thought I&#39;d just
take you through my journey and tell you
a little bit about what&#39;s happened to me
along the way and what I do and so the
theme of my talk is really why I believe
in magic and as the talk theme is around
home I thought the best place to start
would be at home and so I was born in
Salford but I grew up in a rural kind of
Lancashire town full of hills and grass
and nature and we didn&#39;t have a computer
and it was kind of like you know back in
the day we would draw trees not
necessarily just google them and I spent
all of my time playing in nature and
getting stung by nettles and searching
for clues to fix them and making potions
out of plants and then in true
entrepreneurial spirit trying to sell
them to my mum and dad so yeah that&#39;s
kind of where it began and where I grew
up was very close to pendel so the
pendel witches and were sort of you know
always a theme when Halloween came up
and I guess magic has always been close
to my heart and and just something I&#39;ve
always been interested in especially
when it come looking at nature and
learning from nature and my parents so
both my parents work in fashion but
before that in their early career they
worked in engineering and my dad spent
many many of years really meticulously
drawing out plans and commercializing
spirograph I don&#39;t know if anybody
remembers spirograph but it was like
this thing where you just drew no
Photoshop no illustrator no technology
he would hand draw every tool that would
go into and produce in the kits that
you&#39;re hopefully as kids you got to play
with and so again engineering and
science was always around me as I grew
up later on in my dad&#39;s career he gave
up engineering and decided to start a
fashion and brand with my mum and where
she ran the women&#39;s and he ran the men&#39;s
and I spent all of my kind of childhood
to early teens in the back of a
stockroom drawing on new marketing
campaigns dressing up and pretty much
pretended I was a fashion designer and I
became obsessed with one particular
designer Alexander McQueen
I just loved his creative storytelling
and his imagery and
of the sort of new press reports that
came through every season I would be in
the back on a Saturday when my parents
were working looking at all of this
stuff and I didn&#39;t realize at the time
but McQueen used a lot of technology and
a lot of new innovations to tell his
stories so things like Holograms and in
this particular sort of hologram of his
with Kate Moss always stuck into my mind
and at that point I was like right this
is what I want to do I want to create
and want to work in fashion but back to
magic my first interaction with magic as
a kid was when I found a four-leaf
clover so as I said I used to hunt in
nature all the time and I&#39;m pretty
persistent and I found this four-leaf
clover one day and like went running
into the house and was like oh my god oh
my God look I found this
one-in-a-million magic four-leaf clover
and like two feet to school for show and
tell and I was so proud of it and
everyone was like you faked it that&#39;s
not real you&#39;ve just took took another
leaf on it and I was so angry because I
hadn&#39;t I&#39;d like spent hours and hours
and hours as a kid like this like trying
to find a four-leaf clover and then when
I found one no one believed me and I was
like I was so just so miffed off

basically and so I left home at 8:00 and
and I went off in my dad house gret my
dad loves telling the story because I I
sort of ventured off down the lane and
packed my full lift over and my money
box and that was it I was like I&#39;ve had
enough for you like I&#39;m going and he
still says today if you didn&#39;t follow me
make him werewolf noises and dragging me
back kicking and screaming I don&#39;t think
I&#39;d ever come back but 10 years later at
18 I did leave and I went to university
to study fashion however sort of two
months into fashion course and I became
incredibly ill and ended up having to
take the year out and go into hospital
and and I think any sort of 18 year old
when they then are taken away from their
dream and put into a hospital and in a
credible amount of pain you&#39;re going to
get pretty annoyed at the world and a
pretty angry person and and I spend all
of that kind of yeah that year being
diagnosed with all sorts of different
conditions but essentially I was just in
pain and what it one covered was that
I&#39;d actually fractured my spine but I
found it really hard to articulate my
feelings and my pain levels to my
doctors and also to my parents and my
friend
and I was getting treated very much in a
system where it was okay to say what
pain you in one to ten and for me I
couldn&#39;t put a number to the amount of
pain I was in because how did I know
that I wouldn&#39;t suffer more pain or less
pain so I just found it hard so when I
when I went back to University and I
didn&#39;t want to just create fashion for
fashion sake anymore I had a real chip
on my shoulder and I really wanted to
answer some of the messages that as a
person or answer some of the feelings
that I&#39;d been having as a person and try
and communicate that back to somebody
who you know wasn&#39;t inside me and so I
forced my way over to the chemistry
department because what else did I know
well I knew science so I went over there
and I said look I want to work together
I want to understand material and I want
to try and create something that allows
me to visualize the pain that I&#39;ve been
having and I ended up working on a
compound that didn&#39;t necessarily
visualize my pain but it visualized the
Earth&#39;s pain so it&#39;s they looked at
carbon emission and and they ended up
creating a molecule and a compound that
absorbs their pollution so it changes
color from yellow to black to tell you
how much air pollution you&#39;ve absorbed
each day and had this kind of like
standoff moment where four years into
going like this every day similar to
find him before leaf clover I was making
compact like making various adjustments
and very learn and tell having had no
science background to create this
compound I realized that actually if I
give you a book of facts and data and I
tell you your carbon emission footprint
you&#39;re not really going to listen to it
but if I put you in this jacket and put
you behind a bus and you visually see
that then you&#39;re going to have more of
an emotional attachment to it and
perhaps want to change the way that you
live and work every day so rather than
go on to study a kind of PhD and carry
on in that to meet with all about this
storytelling and the messaging and how I
could get that into someone&#39;s hands and
let them interact with it rather than it
stay in research and so I went to the
Royal College of Arts study textiles to
really learn the creative side of the
science and what should the compound be
and what&#39;s the color and what what&#39;s the
message and how should the human
interact with it and I graduated with a
series of inks and also a series of
garments which Kate Moss and Tim Walker
and actually shot together this is one
of them and it&#39;s a series of feathers
that change color and it was that kind
of childhood dream
although although I was down these kind
of crazy missions and that&#39;s all you
know 11-year old Lauren that was
coloring Kate Moss in 11 finally was
dressed in her which was you know an
incredible moment so I decided maybe I
should set my own thing up because there
wasn&#39;t anything that existed that worked
in science and also worked in design so
I went on to set my own company up and I
was like what should I call it so I took
a step back and I have a load of
sketchbooks and blogs and stuff that I
don&#39;t show anyone that I keep myself and
as took took a step back one day and I
was like oh I&#39;m really I&#39;m not
necessarily just interested in fashion
and not necessarily interested in
science what I&#39;m interested in is being
curious about the world that I live in
and myself and anything unseen so I was
like you know I&#39;m interested in
pollution I&#39;m interested in data I&#39;m
interested in DNA and building
structures in all of this kind of unseen
stuff that I can&#39;t as a human understand
and so I wanted to to learn and to go on
to understand that with the tools that I
do know which is science and design and
material and so that&#39;s where it began
and this was one of our first pieces
which I worked on for Formula one so it
tracks aerodynamics and changes its
color dependent on how much aerodynamic
is around the car and also the human and
but again I wanted to keep it a science
and technology to me shouldn&#39;t be
plastic it should be human it should be
beautiful and also intricate and I don&#39;t
know it like crap I love handcraft so I
think all of these sculptures that I
created were hand cut and hand formed
and then impregnated with the dye to
visualize this unseen matter and without
the material the shape that it is
influencing the compound the two can&#39;t
work so it&#39;s up everything has to be
seamless this was a piece that I worked
on for Swarovski which visualizes
fluctuations within the brain so it
changes its color to let you know where
and the brain is active so if you&#39;ve had
been to the gym and you have one
patination or if you&#39;ve been I don&#39;t
know sad or if you&#39;re depressed or if
you&#39;re anxious you generate different
pattern shifts across the brain and
which are then picked up by the stones
which are all uniform and then change
their color to the sort of yeah
different areas of the brain it doesn&#39;t
tell you where it doesn&#39;t tell you when
what you&#39;re feeling it doesn&#39;t tell you
where your emotion but it tells you
where is active
it&#39;s never going to be an MRI scan and
it wasn&#39;t about that for me it was about
thinking about that pain messaging again
and how do you use art and design to
communicate the most unseen thing around
you so if you had a broken arm you would
go to the doctors but if you have a
chemical imbalance or a broken brain you
probably just ignore it so to me I
wanted to create something that helps
you or somebody else understand what&#39;s
going on inside the next project was a
little bit more from that so whereas the
Swarovski piece tells you where is
active this piece reads your EEG levels
so it changes color to the emotional
patterns of the humans so depending on
whether again you&#39;re anxious or sad we
did this as therapy sessions at Fashion
Week and everyone got read which was
anxious but but then the more spirit the
most kind of medicine you becoming the
more spiritual you become the whiter the
piece becomes and that was a really
interesting installation because it
allowed people to see themselves in
front of them for the first time in a
kind of emotional pattern and we
collaborated with a couple of different
universities on this to start to look at
that data and look at how people respond
to objects or themselves when they see
them for the first time this is a
another project again around the unseen
which I&#39;ve just presented at the UN over
in Washington which is all around what
the world&#39;s health again and how do you
get kids back out to nature like how do
you get them off the Wiis and into the
fields well everyone must remember
global hypercolor and every time I
present my work someone goes global
hypercolor which is a heat responsive
t-shirt from when I was little in the
80s but it&#39;s incredibly not sustainable
it&#39;s really bad for the environment so I
wanted to create something that was
almost today&#39;s modern high for color and
so this is a natural recipe that we made
open-source which is derived from a
cabbage which is dyed into a cotton
t-shirt and then every time you wash
that t-shirt in the the water source of
wherever you are it will change to the
pH of that water source to let you know
how much carbon emission is in that
environment so for example this is pH
neutral which is purple that&#39;s like the
ideal color this is London&#39;s color in
the middle and Iceland&#39;s color on the
beside and then we launched it as part
of World Environment Day and asked
children to
to go out dye their own t-shirts and
explore their world and mate start to
make a map of the visual health of the
world so what&#39;s the Amazons color what&#39;s
the Dead Sea&#39;s color what&#39;s Manchester&#39;s
it&#39;s kind of like a game yeah I&#39;m trying
to encourage young young kids to go and
explore in and we launched our own
collections so again like that 11 year
olds that was drawing in the back of the
shop then was presenting her collections
at Selfridges so this was our window at
Selfridges and my collection a couple of
pieces from my collection which
currently sit between McQueen and Chanel
and and the scarf for example monitors
thermal regulation of the body and
changes its color depending on where you
wear it the backpack is completely
responsive to any city you take it to or
just does it something but for me it has
to have deeper meaning it&#39;s not just
about creating a luxury fashion
collection so by creating this beautiful
luxurious silk scarf for Selfridges in
the same time I was working for the NHS
and creating bandages that can detect
things like wounds and tell you when
they need changing so by using high
fashion to get the aesthetic and the
luxurious Ness we then can create
bandages a much more human way they&#39;re
much they feel much much nicer they
interact in a much more human way and I
started to see the insane for lots of
other people so you know we we work with
all sorts of different brands and
agencies and companies to visualize
things like cars of the future you know
what what color are they going to be
when the car becomes autonomous driving
what does the relationship of the user
driving it and the person on the street
have when they are they are driving to
color you know it&#39;s not just a case of
picking a color anymore like can the
color tell you if it&#39;s in speed mode if
it&#39;s in safety mode who&#39;s driving it etc
but it&#39;s not all plain sailing so this
was the first word I presented there was
the first two three years of my company
which really when we think about it was
my passion and my dream which then
became a business and it became really
tough and we lost a project and I had to
make friends redundant that I deployed I
had to sort of sacrifice a lot of things
and I was very much ready to give it up
this time last year and my team went
from 6 to 1 and I just didn&#39;t want to do
it anymore I&#39;m not
I&#39;m gonna be truthful and I admit that
but my it was my roots and my family
again that rallied around me and my dad
who constantly tells me the story of
this kid that goes this is text he sent
me which was you know that the fear of
failure is good and just remember that a
kid that always went down that path and
must have been scared but still did it
anyway and still went on to the unseen
so I thought I wasn&#39;t really a
functioning adult at that time this time
last year I was functioning on very bare
minimum so I just did what I could do
which was create and me and my best
friend were watching a film from
childhood called the Kraft last year
which is a film where the witch changed
the color of her hair like this and I
have pretty long hair so I&#39;d known from
whom vibe projects in my head dependence
from my inks that constantly if anybody
sees me outside today my hair and my
hands always change color dependent on
the temperature of the environment by
accident so I knew I could do it and I
just thought why if I can do it why
should I not do it I mean color change
hair isn&#39;t going to change the world but
little did I know sort of I launched it
and overnight it got 38 million views
and 60 million views later it&#39;s since
become the biggest project the Encinas
ever have and my team went from 1 to 10
and he&#39;s growing every day so I think
for me I had to go back to magic and
back to my root to be able to remember
what I do and although it&#39;s important to
create things with meaning and with sort
of you know deeper world-changing
problems it&#39;s also important to have fun
with what you do and not let it become a
just a career the whole point of my talk
which was around why I believe in magic
is that well one we should believe in
fairy tales I&#39;ve been told many times
not to believe in fairy tales but if I
didn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be stood here today
and I wouldn&#39;t have the the the
interesting things that I get to do
every day and really at the bare minimal
like magic he&#39;s just science that we
don&#39;t understand yet so that&#39;s it
[Applause]
