hello everyone I would like to start off
exactly where I&#39;ve started in my life
and that is being a 15 year old student
an exchange student of the Flex program
in the United States of America where I
went to study for my sophomore year in
high school there were two cue points
that I would take out of my academic
year in the United States coming from
the background that I&#39;ve come the first
one is that knowledge wise book wise my
teachers had taught me absolutely
everything I needed to know to be
prepared to live in this world
academically we were so far ahead that
my classmates would call me a genius
imagine I guess only Peace Corps
volunteers would understand what I&#39;m
talking about in being in tenth grade I
would took I would take calculus as my
math class and they were like wow you&#39;re
so genius is everyone so smart in
Ukraine but the second point that no one
really saw was that lifeWise we were not
as prepared as I would thought coming
from a background that we are all coming
here from and that is the post Soviet
Union we didn&#39;t quite understand how to
make it one how to go into an absolutely
different environment and how to become
a part of that environment we were never
taught to accept the diversity of the
world that was outside of ours we were
never taught how to communicate with the
huge diversity of people that they&#39;re
out there in the world unfortunately we
were never taught to be open to accept
to be flexible to whatever life has to
offer for us and that is something that
I had
my own luckily I had great friends in
the United States I had even greater
teachers and there was something that
was also very new for me when your
teacher is a friend he is not just an
adult who is there to control you and to
contribute to you knowing what you have
to know book wise it was a friend who
would there who would be there to
support you when you&#39;re on your low when
you have a bad mood when you broke up
with your boyfriend or whatever so there
were some very different points in life
when I realized that it was very
important to self educate yourself too
as a teacher now I would say that the
most important thing for our teachers is
to teach students to learn themselves to
get to know themselves and to be able to
be open to all the environment that
there is in this huge world fifteen
years later Here I am the deputy of the
Regional Council one of the youngest
deputies in the Regional Council that
there are I&#39;m also the leader of the
deputy fraction needless to say I am the
youngest deputy in our fraction because
general age of the deputies is around
4050 years old and when I became a
deputy and I had it the fraction I was
28 years old and still the 11 people
that there were in our political party
in the fraction they chose me to be
their leader communication collaboration
are the key points of anything that you
want to be successful absolutely
anything being open to whatever
circumstances that Life offers you being
flexible enough to accept them to soak
up the circumstances that are around you
and to build a new reality for yourself
not only for your environment which
builds itself after you build it for
yourself these are the key principles of
a successful person as I see it for
myself
in politics the sphere that I&#39;m working
in the most important thing is probably
communication being able to communicate
your ideas your standards to the
electors even made me even gain the
result that I had during this elections
being a young girl when I came over to
talk to people during the elections they
were looking at me like girl did you
finish high school like what are you
doing here and I&#39;m like yes I did in
University also would you vote for me
please in that way when people see you
being open they tried to contact you the
same thing in the United States fifteen
years ago it was one of the most
horrendous experiences in my life and in
the same hand it was one of the most
rewarding because being able to break
the walls that we all built for
centuries probably our nation built for
centuries and unfortunately our
societies still built that way that we
still build the walls will still keep
them standing we still try to discipline
everyone but not making them to thrive
to grow to open to the whole world and
what I&#39;m trying to the point I&#39;m trying
to make today is only through this
openness communication and collaboration
hence the result that we all strive for
we can make our students grow out of
this box that unfortunately we and the
previous generations put them into
whether it&#39;s politics whether it&#39;s
becoming a great student whether it&#39;s
making friends abroad whether it&#39;s
reaching result as a consensus
in the political sphere in console where
we also have 10 political parties for 64
Deputies so divide 64 by 10 and you have
a whole bunch of ideas and standards and
ideologies they have to fight constantly
and in that circumstances being the
leader of the fraction you always have
to communicate you always have to find
openness in yourself and in your
partners in your colleagues finding that
something in common that makes you not
only prove your point not only with the
result that you&#39;re striving for it makes
you build a connection and therefore
build a future for your region for your
school for your class and for your
country so let&#39;s try for results thank
you
[Applause]
