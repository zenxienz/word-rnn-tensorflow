I&#39;m 33 years old and I swam with sharks
and I&#39;ve been to space
i deactivated the bomb just three
seconds before it exploded I&#39;ve been to
prison I was even attacked by a zombie
once and I&#39;ve been at the top of Mount
Everest
wearing high heels by now most of you
already have tried virtual reality but
for those who haven&#39;t let me tell you
it&#39;s really cool it allows you to live
experiences you&#39;ve never even dream of
by putting you in the center of any
world any adventure any reality that you
can imagine and when you are there it
feels so real that you feel present and
it feels the truth and you can help but
let emotions flow for more than five
years now I&#39;ve been member of an
innovation services company and I&#39;ve had
the chance to witness the explosion of
emerging technologies from the inside in
all these years I&#39;ve had the attempts to
collaborate both with top brands in
creating really cool immersive campaigns
but also in projects aimed at
implementing innovation in social
matters needless to say the most
rewarding ones are the latter and the
impact they have on people and the
results that you see confirm that
virtual reality is capable of help
bringing a social change and as such
give us hope for a better future through
virtual reality for instance you are
able to witness the realities of other
people&#39;s from a very unique point of
view oneself imagine for a moment that
you are getting old and for some reasons
things are starting to be confusing you
forget about important things like
should have you taken any pills today
which way is home what is it actually
the do you live or even who is that
little girl sitting across across the
table that calls me grandma you guessed
right I&#39;m talking about Alzheimer
now imagine that on top of that nonsense
that you are living your family starts
acting strange they ask you to the
things they never used to before they
are worried of course even a little bit
annoyed or even angry just because they
don&#39;t know what the heck is happening to
you we join forces without shame a
result UK a team at Google in a project
called award through dementia where we
search for a solution for families and
carers to better see and understand what
the person suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s
is going through the key is
understanding Alzheimer not only as a
memory loss was it the dementia it
affects orientation which leads to
confusion and it even disconnect the
brain and the senses like hearing and
eyesight until now it was really
difficult to be able to properly explain
and therefore to properly understand
these symptoms but now on thanks to
virtual reality we are actually able to
put people in the shoes of someone
living with dementia to do so we build
an app and recreated three everyday
scenarios and showed the symptoms that
pose challenges to a person suffering
from any kind of dimension the impact of
the project was so welcomed it was so
good that actually Bupa healthcare is
using it to train their carers in
private residences to be able to see
what their patients angle are going
through and therefore be able to offer
that help the fact that through virtual
reality we can witness others people&#39;s
realities allows us even for a greater
challenge the quest for real empathy
empathy is in making us our brain is
capable of mirroring the emotions of the
person that we are observing that&#39;s why
we empathize we feel others people&#39;s
emotions we live in a world more
connected than ever ever and any story
can spread through the world in just a
matter of seconds and actually when
tragedy hits the world as we&#39;ve seen too
much and too close lately there&#39;s a huge
outpouring of online messages that&#39;s
because we empathy
we are on and share it and have a say
and change your profile picture and show
a rejection which is wonderful but it
feels so short it vanishes so quickly
tribute or reality we can achieve a
whole new level of empathy actually many
NGOs have been using virtual reality in
order to create a greater impact and the
people that come to their events by
putting people inside the realities they
are fighting against for them to be
there for them to see it with their own
eyes to generate proximity and from
their empathy blooms because proximity
is a key driver of empathy there are
four types of proximity temporal spatial
probabilistic and emotional which means
that if something occurs closer to you
either in time or space if you have some
sort of emotional connection to it or if
it&#39;s more probable to happen to you then
is more likely that that matter will
raise your attention and that you will
empathize with it actually cornerstone
contacted us for a very unique and
beautiful project cornerstone is a
uk-based charity focused on providing a
safe home for kids in the foster care
system they contacted us to make a vr
short based on empathy and aimed at
generating an emotional link for parents
considering fostering a kid to find the
courageous needed to make the lifelong
commitment of adopting a child and
providing him or her with the safe home
and a life of love such is the power of
empathy and that wonderful the things it
can lead us to do but virtual reality is
not only about sitting back and
observing information it opens a whole
new world in terms of platforms and
tools that we can build that can help
improve our lives and break barriers
that we encounter today and actually
with that in mind we built the first
teleportation platform let me explain it
a hospital in Holland conducted us
because they wanted to know if there was
any sort of solution
emerging technologies to help long
staying patients be able to escape their
rooms while of course they were actually
able to leave the hospital so current
means of communication weren&#39;t enough
not even video calls we needed to move
from calling or talking to to being with
because isolation was affecting their
mindset into a negative way which was
affecting the recovery process virtual
reality and emerging technologies once
again allowed us to go one step further
so what we did was to build a closed
system where we placed a 360 camera in
the home of some of the patients
actually like this little guy there that
camera recorded everything around it and
that video and that audio we&#39;re streamed
to a headset of your glasses like the
one you have there
so when patient and then we gave it to
patients so when patients put it on they
were able to see everything around it
now remember that I mentioned that when
you are there in the virtual reality you
feel present and it fills the truth you
can imagine the face of this little guy
after months of being in the hospital to
put the glasses on and feel home with
mom and dad and even the little dog that
just couldn&#39;t stop barking as soon as he
heard his voice he was absolutely happy
it was wonderful and actually the
hospital carried on some studies and
confirmed that by using this system the
patients were happier and the recovery
process was easier and faster so once we
saw the results we couldn&#39;t just stop
there and what we did was to turn this
closed system into an open platform for
everyone to have access to it because
these sort of platforms and tools are
not only for these cases in terms of
Education for instance online students
can avoid one of the major gaps that
elearning has which is the lack of group
consciousness the lack of classmates and
colleagues so through this sort of
platforms they can actually go to school
but again we
can go even one step further now imagine
someone confined at home for any reason
for any condition or even a prisoner or
again a person that has to be
hospitalized for a long time through
these systems they can actually keep on
going to school and that&#39;s what the use
of virtual reality and emerging
technologies for a greater good is all
about technology won&#39;t make us better
human beings that&#39;s on us but as a tool
it can help us improve our lives and
break barriers that we encounter today
and as a mean of communication it can
help us fight apathy with empathy and
proximity get us to open our eyes and
see others people&#39;s realities to get
involved and to commit as this is the
key to trigger social change that can
give us hope for a better future thank
