get on your tiptoes I&#39;d tell myself
stand up taller lower your squeaky voice
these were some of the thoughts that
raced through my head every time I
stepped foot into my research lab at age
11 I was always preoccupied over the
little things like keeping my algebra
notebook shut so no one could tell that
I was a middle schooler working
alongside PhD students and in my
experience up to that point age had
always been a limitation now I&#39;m a
fourteen-year-old developing a detection
method for tumor spheroids in cancer
diagnostics or at least I&#39;m trying but
most wouldn&#39;t expect anyone like me to
find a cure to cancer or a solution to
global warming but I&#39;m trying and I
shouldn&#39;t be an anomaly because
unfortunately I don&#39;t think most
preteens can say they felt that
encapsulating feeling where you press
your eye up against a microscope just to
find that florescent green stain you&#39;ve
been working months to find because the
lab is my second home as nerdy as it
sounds the hours I&#39;ve spent every day
after school calibrating optic systems
or imaging the deadly masses of tumor
spheroids are my most relaxing times a
day but in all seriousness having worked
in a research institution so now since I
was 11 I&#39;ve always been less than half
the age of everyone around me my age
became something I&#39;d minimize and it
eventually became my biggest weakness
but not anymore because I&#39;ve realized
that kids think differently than adults
it&#39;s not a matter of better or worse
just differently but with the modern
world social structure the youth
perspective isn&#39;t being taken seriously
in science or in general and this needs
to change
no one ever expects any groundbreaking
things to come from my population
because they&#39;ve just never been done
before by people then other than quite
frankly older middle-aged men I mean as
far as history of support
the revolutionary ideas to change
humanity forever have all come from the
same group of people Newton Einstein
Edison the list goes on even today the
average age of a Nobel Prize winner in
the sciences is 57 years old that&#39;s
still waiting more than two-thirds the
human lifespan just to make our marks on
society the belief that a certain number
of years is equivalent to intelligence
has stunted generations why do we ask
kids what they want to be when they grow
up when instead we should be asking what
do you want to do right now shouldn&#39;t we
take it upon ourselves to teach kids to
be proactive about their dreams no
single factor determines intelligence
and capability not age not race not
gender diverse groups of people can
contribute ideas from different
backgrounds which is exactly what
science needs at a time of so much
progression rather than only having
experienced people with nearly the exact
same information drilled into their
heads sitting around conference room
tables shouldn&#39;t we also include more
people with perhaps less years but
different ideas and ages all over the
spectrum wouldn&#39;t this be more
productive one age group in particular
kids are quite unique problem-solving at
a younger age is entirely different from
the standardized thinking of an adult
having lived decades longer adults have
conformed to the norms of society such
that basically everyone has the same
thinking
however the youth the youth have a spark
an entirely different element of
innovation that simply cannot be
replicated during the dolt hood kids
don&#39;t know the laws of physics the rules
of society are the very concept of
impossibility like when we see this
image for instance immediately most of
you would think it&#39;s just a random black
line but see that&#39;s the problem
when I asked adults this they replied
with the same unimpressed response and
some even went to the lengths of looking
for cursive writing hidden within the
loops but even writing is a very
standardized way of thinking if you ask
me on the other hand when I asked kids
of 13 years and younger they gave me
radically different answers like my
younger sister my usual go to guinea pig
said she saw a volcano a dinosaur&#39;s head
and a dog eating a bat and all these
answers were produced in just five
seconds just this simple squiggle
experiment shows the worlds of
difference that exists between the adult
and kid mentality kids have the ability
to see beyond reality almost into
another dimension where their innovation
has no limitations in 1963 dr. Raymond
Cattell proposed the idea of two types
of intelligence crystallized learn
knowledge over experience and time and
fluid intelligence utilizing novel logic
to solve new problems whereas adults are
more proficient in terms of crystallized
fluid intelligence is where kids excel
the youth possess the out-of-the-box
thinking that will propel science
forward and this has endless
applications when we look at technology
for example people who have whom have
learned how to use pcs at an older age
will obviously have a much harder time
comprehending the mechanisms behind it
this isn&#39;t to say that they can but
rather that kids are more apt as to
doing so the same principle applies for
languages in linguistic development it&#39;s
human nature to pick up surrounding
language but this capability decreases
with time the reality remains that kids
who are exposed to a stimulus earlier in
life will be much more proficient in
that field we live in a world where
devices have taken over the roles of
babysitters as kids the curiosity of
kids
encapsulated by phones and computers
technology is revolutionizing the world
and the truth is that kids have the best
understanding of it even though most
parents think phones are rotting our
brains according to my grandma that&#39;s
what her parents said about electricity
the technology boom has put younger
generations on an entirely alternative
understanding of applications of
artificial intelligence in advanced
diagnostics in radiology or analysis of
Astrophysical phenomena these are things
that are just happening now
with the decreasing age of exposure of
babies and infants to technology but now
here&#39;s the thing just acknowledging this
age discrimination that exists in
science isn&#39;t enough to do anything
about it
what am I saying throw your infants into
a nuclear hazard lab not exactly but a
love for problem solving needs to be
nurtured from a younger age and this
responsibility falls on adults when I
was in eighth grade I was looking for a
mentor to support me in writing a
publication so surely enough I emailed a
few professors my research abstract and
a few days later they all responded
extremely positively to even offered me
positions in their Graduate research
labs at major universities I was
accelerated that I would have the
opportunity to work with such
world-renowned scientists I was so
excited that I was sure I would have at
least 20 publications and definitely win
a Nobel Prize by the end of it but
that&#39;s not what happened not even close
when I replied hesitantly of revealing
my age that I was 13 years old at the
time none of them ever responded even
after countless desperate follow-up
emails the opportunity was severed all
because of an unchangeable number tagged
on to every human being in situations
like these
the blame falls on adults for entirely
leaving a child hopeless making them
think that their ideas are irrelevant
and especially when the kid took such an
initiative to reach out hidden under the
mask of email people were actually
taking me seriously but when reality
fell upon them they immediately cut the
connection we can&#39;t let the next
generations stop taking risks because we
need to fuel the next changemakers that
will improve the world in the modern era
of science there&#39;s still a lot left to
be done but if we can start by breaking
the age barrier the possibilities are
endless as long as we push the next
generations in the right direction
the only problem left will be to harness
all the brain power because quite
frankly the first people on Mars are the
ones to develop a vaccine for AIDS won&#39;t
look like these guys anymore thank you
