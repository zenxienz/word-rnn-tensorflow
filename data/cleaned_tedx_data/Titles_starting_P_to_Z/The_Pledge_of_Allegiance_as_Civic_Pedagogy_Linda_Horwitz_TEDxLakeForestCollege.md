good evening I&#39;m sure you guys are all
pretty well-versed in the current
controversy over the national anthem I
know my facebook feed is inundated with
memes exploit those who kneel in front
of the national anthem are not
processing the flag just says the parks
wasn&#39;t protesting buses and people on
hunger strikes aren&#39;t protesting food
yet still some people believe it&#39;s
unpatriotic to not stand for the
national anthem some have even suggested
those football players should be fired
from their jobs if the NFL doesn&#39;t have
any rule requiring people to stand just
as the u.s. Criminal Code doesn&#39;t as
well but the US flag code does say that
when the national anthem is sung those
in military uniform should do the
military salute and everybody else
should stand at attention with their
handle or heart that should implies a
duty a responsibility but all voluntary
you don&#39;t have to do it what I want to
talk about today is how we learn what it
means to be patriotic and how do we
learn how to do when other people
express themselves differently than we
would like them to to answer that
question we got to start with the
history of Chicago this is the Chicago
flag it represents the geography of
Chicago and that the top right stripe is
the north side the middle red stripe is
the west side and the bottom white
stripe is the south side hence quad we
don&#39;t even each side because you&#39;d be in
Lake Michigan and be all wet the fog
does represent water though because the
top blue stripe is a North Branch of
Chicago River and the bottom blue stripe
is a South Branch as Chicago River it&#39;s
not clicking yeah there we go okay so
the flag doesn&#39;t just represent the
geography of Chicago it also represents
the history through the stars in terms
of each one represents a certain
anecdote in our history the first one
is fort Dillon massacre of 1812 the
second one is the Great Chicago Fire of
1871 the third one is the sorry claiming
Exposition of 1893 and the last one is a
century of progress 1933 1934 so the
first two stars are about Chicago&#39;s
resilience how we respond in the face of
tragedy the second two are about the two
World&#39;s Fairs and they represent what
Chicago can do when we come together as
a community the 1893 World&#39;s Fair was
supposed to celebrate the 400 years of
what we have done on our shores since
Columbus arrived that was its initial
plan but had a secondary goal as well
the secondary goal was to put Chicago on
the map literally before that time
Milwaukee would be an international Maps
but Chicago would not they wanted to
show that we were world-class City both
to other Americans and to people abroad
we Chicago attempted to accomplish both
of those goals so the creation of what
people call Dwight City was a gleaming
white neoclassical city with electric
lights and running water something
people hadn&#39;t seen before by all
accounts the fair was a great success 27
million people came to the fair when
people talk about it they talk about all
the things that they&#39;re introduced the
world to because introduced Ferris
wheels Cracker Jacks Pabst Blue Ribbon
beer fluorescent lights and stamps
commemorative stamps and coins when
people talk about the fair they
generally miss one of the most important
and enduring first that the fair had the
Pledge of Allegiance
although the fair was in 1893 401 years
after Columbus arrived the building
dedication happened October 19th 1892
and where President Harrison declared as
Columbus Day at this point in our
history we used to celebrate Columbus
Day every hundred years not every year
at that point there was a pretty famous
children&#39;s magazine called the youths
companion that was dedicated to piety
and virtue
- they had a pet project where they were
trying to get every school in the nation
to fly an American flag at that point
most schools didn&#39;t have a flag let
alone fly in so when President Harrison
announced that we were going to have
this Columbus Day celebration and that
schoolchildren to be involved in the
process the magazine got one of their
employees Francis Bellamy to get himself
elected to the chair of the committee of
the association of school
superintendents so he could have a say
and what would happen on that day what
he did was he wrote the pledge and he
planned a program that highlighted
schoolchildren across the nation
saluting the flag and doing the pledge
the pledge that Bellamy invented was I
pledge allegiance to my flag and the
Republic for which it stands one nation
indivisible with liberty and justice for
all it sounds pretty familiar to you I
imagine with a little bit of slight
distinction the other thing that Bellamy
did was he identified what he wanted for
the salute he wanted people to look
towards a flag with her hand up and
their palm down which explains the slide
you saw just now it was a big success
people got very excited about this idea
of people pledging the flag and schools
across the nation started doing it but
they didn&#39;t always do belamis salute in
New York City they gave schools five
different choices of different pledges
in San Francisco every school did
something different that one schools
pledge was we turned to the flag as a
sunflower turns of the Sun pledging our
heads and our hearts to one country one
country one language one flag this went
on for a while and while people who were
excited about school children doing the
Pledge they were upset that different
people were doing different pledges
there wasn&#39;t that unity so in 1923 a
group of citizens got together to have a
flag convention where they wanted to
figure out what the flag etiquette
should be so we would all do it all the
same they took Bellamy&#39;s pledge but they
changed it slightly they modified the
flag in terms of which flag we are
pledging to as a nation of immigrants
some people were concerned that when
people pledged the flag they could be
pledging to any flag so they added
the United States of America they also
continued using Bellamy salute schools
across the nation started doing it
people really thought it was a great
thing
one evidence that was really part of our
American fabric is during World War Two
in 1941 fourth of July President
Roosevelt had one of his fireside chats
over the radio and he ended his talk by
saying when we do our great pledge we
should also make sure that we are
believing in adding in pledging our work
our will and our willingness to die for
the flag if need be and then he ended
the chat by having Chief Justice Harlan
Stone lead the entire nation in
Bellamy&#39;s pledge because of that a year
later Congress decided it was time for
us to actually codify the flag rules and
etiquette and so they actually made a
flag code again that they used Bellamy&#39;s
pledge as it was revised in 1923 and
they kept Bellamy salute six months
later they revised it because they
realize that Bellamy salute was a little
too close to the Nazi salute so they
changed to the hand over the heart that
we&#39;re all more familiar with as soon as
the pledge was codified into law people
started being concerned about this
question of whether or not it was
voluntary or not and court cases
sprouted up the Supreme Court had made
it very clear that the pledge was
voluntary we could not require anybody
to salute the flag let alone budget in
the 50s where we were a little bit
concerned about the communist threat
Congress decided to change the pledge
again this is when we got the under God
phrase into the pledge and again people
who are concerned about what this would
mean and whether or not it was
constitutional or not since the
Constitution says that we&#39;re not allowed
to have oaths or tests of religion for
public office or public trust but the
Supreme Court decided that since the
pledge is voluntary it wasn&#39;t a problem
for the Constitution and so we&#39;ve had
the pledge that we have as we move
forward states across the nation decided
to make doing the pledge required in
all public schools Wisconsin even
required it in private schools and well
they couldn&#39;t require that any
individual student recite the Pledge
they could require that schools were
sighted giving students the opportunity
that they could recite it as well today
if you ask young people about the Pledge
of Allegiance you get all sorts of
different responses so I&#39;m going to tell
you we didn&#39;t do it others will say we
do it but they didn&#39;t really explain it
to us well others would say they blew it
over the loudspeaker and you can add
your voice to it or not as you choose
and this is where I start to get worried
about the pledge because the Pledge of
Allegiance is a speech Act which means
we&#39;re doing something with words akin to
promising threatening arguing naming
vetoing and speech act theory makes it
very clear that they have rules around
these different speech acts rules who
can do it how to do it how to do it
correctly and what it means to abuse it
when the most important rules for most
speech acts I think you have to mean it
one evidence of that I think really
makes it very clear how that works in
terms of pledge is that we have separate
rules for people in uniform and people
not in uniform when it comes to the
Pledge uniform when the pledge is spoken
are supposed to give the military salute
but they&#39;re supposed to stay silent
they&#39;re not supposed to say the Pledge
why would that be well I believe it&#39;s
because once you put on that uniform
you&#39;ve already pledged your life to the
flag you cannot choose not to at this
point and since you can&#39;t choose not to
say the Pledge you also are
inappropriate for you to actually say
the pledge this voluntary aspects a big
part of it second thing I think is
important to think about we think about
the notion of the pledge as a speech act
is that it&#39;s a pledge not an oath when
we say an oath we swear to somebody else
like God
well we pledge we&#39;re pledging to
ourselves done correctly you&#39;re speaking
to yourself you&#39;re telling yourself what
you believe the flag means and you&#39;re
saying wait your commitment
is to that flag to me this really was
reminiscent of James Carey a
communication scholar who talks about
the idea that American communication
scholars are too interested and the
transmission point of communication
moving ideas from one point to another
and they forget about the ritual aspect
of communication the ritual aspect is
when we&#39;re not solely concerned about
that transmission piece we&#39;re interested
in what the communication does for
culture on some other level when I
explained to my students I usually use
the example of the Passover Seder where
we retell the story of the Jews leaving
Egypt moving from slavery to freedom the
way our supposed to tell the story is
you&#39;re supposed to be as though the
people the table they themselves are
moving from slavery to freedom
now I&#39;ve participated in this tradition
for over 40 years
and most of the time the people the
table have also been part of this
tradition year after year after year so
we&#39;re not transmitting information when
we tell the story
we&#39;re not even reminding each other
about the information instead we&#39;re
enacting what it means to be Jewish and
we are remembering why it&#39;s important
the whole idea that people across the
world are doing the same thing at the
same time and they&#39;ve been doing it for
centuries and if we do it correctly it
will continue to be done centuries to
come and so that reminds us how
important it is to spend that knowledge
to the next generation to me the Pledge
of Allegiance does something similar for
the American community when we say the
Pledge we are renewing the vows that the
American colonists made when they wrote
the Declaration of Independence the
Declaration of Independence ends with a
phrase we mutually pledge to each other
Our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred
honor this is why when I hear about
young people saying the Pledge and not
meaning it or not even understanding it
it seems to me that we&#39;re making the
pledge into conformity instead of
Liberty and when I hear about the
loudspeaker blaring
for people to just sort of listen to it
seems like we&#39;re teaching passivity
instead of activity what do you look at
the fact that fifty nine point seven
percent of eligible voters voted in less
presidential election we can see that a
large number of citizens are not doing
the smallest thing that&#39;s response that
they&#39;re required to do as citizens and
being active so today I am not
advocating getting rid of the pledge I&#39;m
advocating making it meaningful because
I think it&#39;s important I think it&#39;s a
point where we can come together and
I&#39;ll agree if you think back to last
year&#39;s conventions both the Republican
and the Democratic convention opened
with the Pledge of Allegiance and people
at both of those conventions quoted the
pledge in their speech current vice
president Mike Pence quote it to the
Republicans and Senator Cory Booker and
his keynote arrests quoted it to the
Democrats and sitting President Barack
Obama he quoted it as well so when I
think about the national anthem and I
think about NFL players kneeling to me I
think it&#39;s a clear sign that they are
breaking the code and that we&#39;re
supposed to recognize they&#39;re doing so
for peaceful protest and it makes so
much sense to me within the confines of
a football game just think about when
you take a knee in football when you
receive a kickoff in the end zone you
take a knee to clearly explain that you
are not gonna fight for yardage you&#39;re
going to accept the placement of the
ball I&#39;m the designated yard line and at
the end of the game if you want to work
let the clock just run down you take a
knee to say that you&#39;re not gonna fight
for yardage of points you&#39;re just gonna
wait til the game ends so when you see
someone take a knee during the national
anthem I think you should think about
what they&#39;re trying to say and ask
questions instead of offer ire
thank you
[Applause]
