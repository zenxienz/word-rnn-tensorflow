imagine thousands of people packed in
this one open space
the rain it pours in the wind it roars
and every now and then in the distance
we hear the sound of war
it&#39;s Lebanon the Baker Valley to be
precise more than a million people threw
the dice 2/3 of them little kids that
fled their homes in Syria hoping for a
safer spot somewhere in the area and
here they are away from war but soaked
in disappointment fence stand by
violence politics and borders
waiting in this muddy place I know it
seems so pointless
no house no school nothing collective no
safe spot no hope for a better
perspective Lebanon country the size 1/3
of the Netherlands in that small country
more than 2 million refugees found a
place with their families
and all this makes me think of funny huh
the woman I met four years ago she lives
in Lebanon with her four kids and while
the oldest one eats a bag of crisps I
asked about her story she tells me how
she lost her inventory and about her
husband she was married to for a year or
five and the fact that he got shot in
the head in front of his children&#39;s eyes
and then there&#39;s this little kid named
dylon drowned to death and lying in the
sand head down when his picture was
taken it&#39;s a fact in Europe started to
awaken what&#39;s this crazy pretentious but
this little kid got all the attention
while he&#39;s only one thousands and became
a victim of Pride and hate
if I don&#39;t think it&#39;s horrible don&#39;t get
me wrong I do there&#39;s a fact that seems
to be true it&#39;s been bad for so long so
many things have been going wrong this
mess it&#39;s been going on for way too long
truth is it&#39;s been a hell for six years
but now when they&#39;re close to our safety
and a place it&#39;s safe for us to be close
to our security when they come to our
door and knock we panic and are in shock
saying no we cannot let them in because
we&#39;re scared they&#39;ll destroy us from
within but aren&#39;t we being just too
skeptic after all humanity&#39;s been
through do we really think this is too
much I mean we survived the dark ages
world wars epidemics and such we build
rockets satellites we learned to fly we
conquered dictators fought for equality
we even went to the moon and in a drive
life
so where do we start creating a world
that is better
a world without hate world without pride
a world fueled by love when we want to
create the future look at the future
start with the children kids innocent
yet with capacity to be influenced
fragile but full of potential special
world changers vulnerable Gamemakers
becoming the place they grow up in and I
believe we have a responsibility
co-creating the future within our
ability you can call me a dreamer if
that&#39;s what you want but everything
we&#39;ve reached started with people that
dared to look beyond beyond the problems
fears and what could not be done they
had a dream they stood for a vision and
they saw the things that should be done
and I believe as those people then we
can be like them now call me naive or
maybe just too simple but I believe as a
unit we can start the effect
rock in the water taking it one step
farther movement helping children
creating a world creating a better
perspective
