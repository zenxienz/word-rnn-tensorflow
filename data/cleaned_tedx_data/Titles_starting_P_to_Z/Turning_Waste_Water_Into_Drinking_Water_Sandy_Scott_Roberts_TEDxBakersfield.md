good morning so my name is sandy Scott
Roberts and I&#39;m a civil engineer at the
Orange County Water District I&#39;m also a
wife and a mother of two daughters and a
resident in Orange County I decided to
pursue a career in engineering from a
recommendation from my high school
physics teacher
after much debate on which bubble I
should fill in and my college
application mechanical engineer
aeronautical engineer structural
engineer
I decided on civil and environmental
engineering emphasis on water treatment
when asked why my answer was simple
everybody needs water humans can go 40
days without food but we can&#39;t go more
than 3 days without water without
drinkable water so at the Orange County
Water District we make drinking water
for Orange County so how many of you
today use the restroom brushed your
teeth or took a shower I&#39;m hoping you at
least did one of those today that water
comes into our homes through reservoirs
groundwater basins two treatment plants
pump stations pipelines we use that
water for these purposes laundry dishes
showering and once that water is used it
goes into our sewers and it is that is
considered wastewater that wastewater is
being treated by the Orange County
Sanitation District and purified by the
Orange County Water District through the
groundwater replenishment system to make
drinking water so I&#39;m going to talk to
you about that today but before I get
into that I&#39;d like to make a point about
water on our earth there has never been
new water on our earth we&#39;ve had the
same volume of water on our earth for
millions of years so what this means is
that we have all at one point drank
water that was one time dinosaur pee so
if you take that into consideration all
water is recycles and risk water
recycling is nothing
new water recycling has been termed in
the media toilet to tap you can see all
the media headlines scrolling behind me
toilet to tap that doesn&#39;t sound very
pleasing toilet to tap also is is not
correct like I mentioned and we all
disgust with the activities we did today
while we washed our dishes or we took a
shower or we use the sink wastewater is
made up of a bunch of uses it&#39;s not only
toilet actually only 10% of wastewater
comes from the toilet so this acronym
toilet to tap is missing that detail
it&#39;s also missing the detailed of the
treatment processes that take place in
between the toilet and the tap or the
wastewater and to your tap so I&#39;m going
to go through and kind of walk through
those treatment processes now so that
wastewater goes to the Orange County
Sanitation District first that&#39;s a
wastewater treatment plant and they go
through a preliminary screening process
this removes big items from the
treatment process bowling balls
two-by-fours things that shouldn&#39;t be in
the treatment process after that there&#39;s
a clarification step is called
preliminary treatment solids are settled
out and then that clarified water moves
on to the next step which is called
secondary treatment secondary treatment
is a biological step much like the
microbes in our stomach break down food
to help us digest food the secondary
treatment process uses microbes to our
benefit to break down organics in that
wastewater
this water then moves on to the Orange
County Water District groundwater
replenishment system we take it and we
treat it even further our first process
is micro filtration this is a hollow
fiber membrane or a straw and that we
use to filter out small but a small
bacteria small particles analogy to the
micro filtration system is
making ice water out of the straw the
ice is too big and won&#39;t get sucked up
into the straw well that&#39;s exactly what
happens with our micro filters except
for that our hole size and the straws
and the they&#39;re called pore size are
actually one three hundredths the
diameter of a human hair so if you take
a look at one of your strands of hair
and imagine the size of one three
hundredths the diameter of that hair
that&#39;s the size of the particles and the
bacteria we&#39;re filtering out through
this micro filtration process after
micro filtration we send the water
through reverse osmosis many of you are
familiar with this treatment process
it&#39;s also used by bottled water
companies what reverse osmosis this is a
thin film membrane it&#39;s spiral round in
a in a plastic pressure vessel and we&#39;re
putting high pressurized water to push
pure water molecules through that
membrane
unlike the micro filters which I
explained had a pore size in diameter
the reverse osmosis membranes have a
molecular scale cutoff so pure water
molecules are all that&#39;s pushed through
large molecules like pharmaceuticals
pesticides viruses actually stay behind
so the pure water molecules
that&#39;s called permeate is pushed through
and goes on to the next step an another
analogy for a membrane is on our body
it&#39;s our skin our skin holds in our
bodily fluids it holds in blood but it
does allow sweat to diffuse out if
you&#39;re exercising or if you&#39;re hot so it
acts very similar to reverse osmosis
membrane and that it loves certain
fluids to diffuse through it and others
not
after the reverse osmosis this permeate
goes through the ultraviolet light or UV
photolysis this process uses UV light
shines it on the water and this UV light
breaks down any small molecules that may
have made it on to the next process
we&#39;ve all experienced damaging effects
of UV light if you&#39;re in the
too long and get a sunburn this process
acts in the same way and that it takes
that UV light breaks down small
molecules nitrous means 1 4 dioxane
endocrine disrupters real small
molecules that shouldn&#39;t be in the water
once it&#39;s broken down it&#39;s non-detect in
a laboratory analysis after UV light the
water is so pure that it&#39;s near
distilled water we&#39;ve literally
separated out the water molecules we
actually add minerals like calcium back
into the water to stabilize it we then
test this water for over 400 different
compounds this is above and beyond
what&#39;s required for standard drinking
water for bottled water we do this
voluntarily to ensure that our water is
safe we produce 100 million gallons per
day of this purified water that&#39;s enough
water for eight hundred and fifty
thousand people the water is after the
treatment process we actually take the
water and we put it into Orange County&#39;s
groundwater Basin that&#39;s an underground
natural reservoir made up of sand and
silt layers the water travels through
the sand and is then pulled up through
wells production wells for cities for
farmers for irrigation and then sent to
the customers your home or the tap the
Orange County Water District uses the
groundwater replenishment system water
to continuously replenish the
groundwater Basin so therefore water
levels don&#39;t go down we maintain safe
water levels and enough water for the
residents in Orange County does this
only work in Orange County
no Australia Singapore have also very
large treatment facilities just like we
do that do the same thing this is a
cost-effective local and sustainable
water supply solution especially for
regions in drought
it also for at least for Orange County
it makes us less reliant on imported
water Southern California relies heavily
on imported water from Northern
California from the Colorado River
hundreds of hundreds of miles away by
having this local supply of water in
Orange County this opens up those
supplies for other cities in California
to date we have made 230 billion gallons
of purified water that&#39;s enough to fill
the Coliseum in Rome over 750 times so
the engineering the science behind
recycling water is proven is defendable
it&#39;s nothing new however the public
perception of drinking water that was
once sewer water is harder to overcome
this is slowly gaining acceptance
through public outrage through education
things like talks like these where
education and and people are realizing
that water is water most recently and
interestingly in recycled water has been
gaining acceptance through beer my
husband he believes that humans can&#39;t go
more than a few days without beer so
this is this is a huge advantage for
recycled water you can also come up with
very creative names for a recycled water
beer waste water wheat recycled red ale
drop in a logger these are just a few
names Stone Brewing Company also just
came out with their recycled water beer
they&#39;re calling it full circle Pale Ale
so you all have a chance today to get
over the yuck factor and I&#39;m challenging
you you can all reach down below your
seats and there&#39;s a bottle of water
that is under your seats take a look at
your bottle of water it looks very much
like a bottle of water that you can
purchase in a grocery store the water is
clear as you can see and so you can go
ahead and open your bottle of water and
take a sip so what does it taste like
water it tastes like water because it is
water so myself my husband my kids the
residents in Orange County who&#39;ve been
drinking recycled water for the last ten
years to help supplement water supplies
even during droughts we&#39;ve all gotten
over it
we&#39;ve gotten over the fact that this
water comes from wastewater and realized
that all water is recycled and this is
pure water from the gwrs system Cheers
and thank you
[Applause]
you
