let me start by asking a fairly simple
question but what is language language
can be defined as a system of words or
signs that people use to express their
thoughts or feelings to each other
thousands of different languages
surround us and enable us to connect as
human beings however languages can also
disconnect us in a multitude of ways
specifically because of their misuses
the impact of language is typically
underestimated despite the fact that a
single word can mean a thousand things
to one person that could mean nothing to
another take the word fear for example
when I say fear what thoughts or images
pop up in your minds I know for me it&#39;s
sailing the i-b but a myriad of
different ideas may arise in each one of
our minds scientifically fear the chain
reaction beginning in the brain
producing an almost entirely autonomic
response and the involuntary response on
a more personal level fear is more than
just these neural impulses it&#39;s what
feels like a limitation now imagine
saying yes to one of those things that
you held great fear towards imagine the
thing yes to your biggest fear the thing
that haunted you most was saying yes to
someone when they asked you to get out
of bed get dressed and face people at
work or in school or in public although
this makes seem like a norm to most of
us this is something something that
people with social anxiety disorder face
hearing the word fear and ik waiting my
fears to someone else has never works
because each individual experiences and
- and interprets things differently fear
is a common denominator with many cases
of anxiety yet the word anxiety itself
isn&#39;t always used in the right context
with various types of anxiety that
exists all around us the word anxiety
can spark different aspects of fear
within different people
let me zoom into the social aspect of it
social anxiety well they&#39;re claiming
that a certain person is just giving me
anxiety may only actually mean moderate
levels of stress to me
it touches much deeper levels to those
who face social anxiety disorder their
fears go far beyond just the shyness but
rather prevent interaction on social
settings gradually crippling their
social lives social anxiety is more
specific to the fear triggered in the
idea of criticism judgment or rejection
therefore it does not hinder their
ability to perform in any setting until
put into a situation questioning their
own comfort ability through any form of
disapproval whether that be internal or
external this doesn&#39;t just end at an
issue within one individual but rather
spans to those external individuals a
sign of social anxiety isn&#39;t always the
easiest thing to detect social anxiety
is the third most common psychiatric
disorder following major depression and
alcohol abuse yet despite its rioting
nature in a communal setting it is
incredibly under diagnosed misdiagnosed
or not even treated properly at all in
fact less than one in five people who
face an anxiety disorder are properly
treated now this can be partially due to
the fact that it&#39;s not an issue that
comes all at once but rather it&#39;s the
people that have an issue going inside
of them that day by day and year by year
gets worse it is most common in those in
their mid-teens so below the ages of 25
of which around 75% of these individuals
have faced interpersonal issues at one
point in their life from an external
perspective it&#39;s hard to tell when
someone has anxiety it doesn&#39;t just end
at this issue within one individual but
rather sponsor these external
individuals ask
the question of how do I help people who
face social anxiety push themselves
farther and farther away from social
interaction so is that our
responsibility to encourage them to be
in social situations or do we let them
maintain their comfort zones and once we
do that doesn&#39;t it just get worse
personally my best friend role model and
the sole person who takes away my
stresses of the world has social anxiety
let&#39;s go ahead and call her Simona now
my intention today is not to share all
her experiences or my experiences
dealing with social anxiety nor is there
really one purpose but to touch one
individual whether that be someone
you&#39;re wanting to learn about social
anxiety someone facing social anxiety or
someone on the outside wanting to get in
and help is vital to be there for people
regardless of how much they choose to
reveal but to do so there has to be a
basis of understanding for me to be the
best possible support system I can -
Simona I have to understand her I&#39;m
going to share the steps I took in
learning and understanding how exactly
to be that supporter to somebody with
social anxiety in my opinion trying to
help is one of the most challenging
things because more than anything I want
to be that person to take her fear of
people away from her and make her
realize how beautiful she really is but
I also need to be aware that my mere
comfort doesn&#39;t account for the years of
an internal issue going inside of her
there was definitely one pivotal point
in my understanding of social anxiety I
was having a conversation with Simona
about how the people closest to me are
those who she&#39;s gone along with because
I not only see her the best judge of
character but her personality is one
that enables me to escape reality for a
second
and laughed so hard that my not so
existent adds hurt if someone is able to
break down her wall they&#39;ve literally
made a mark on my life too in this
particular conversation I had no
specific intent but rather to express
her how I look up to her is more of a
role model the response I got greatly
differed from the candid nature of this
conversation she started crying her
tears came all at once and she could not
stop and that was somehow my fault
I made the person I care about most cry
but it wasn&#39;t about me because she
surely revealed that her tears were out
of honour she didn&#39;t understand how she
could mean so much to someone when she
didn&#39;t even mean that much to her own
self
this is when I realized it&#39;s not just
this fear of people it&#39;s a fear within
oneself a sense of criticism that
they&#39;re limited in what they have to
offer now I cannot claim that I have had
experience in social anxiety but seeing
it externally really put my problems
into perspective I am NOT her doctor I
am NOT her therapist
I&#39;m not even considered an adult in this
country so what am I let me try to
describe my role I am her support now
there&#39;s not one simple thing that I need
to do to fulfill that role because it&#39;s
comprised of anything and everything
that will ultimately make her feel
better one day I could be the shoulder
she needs to cry on just because it&#39;s
one of those days some days I need to be
her pep talk er because although she&#39;s
not asking for my validation she needs
someone to help her believe in herself
and other days my silent presence is
just enough to make her aware she&#39;s not
alone in this big world one of the
biggest things I have learned to accept
is that as much as I want to help
it&#39;s about what she needs when you&#39;re at
a social gathering say a part of your
event and you hear the doorbell ring
welcoming new faces and friendly
introductions but you&#39;re caught up on
the thumping of her footsteps moving
from a steady pace to a sprint the first
thing you&#39;re going to want to do is run
right behind her and make sure she&#39;s
okay but she&#39;s not running from you
she&#39;s not running from the guests she&#39;s
running to hide herself and as much as
you want to be there for her it&#39;s not
about you it&#39;s not about analyzing the
situation to depict the one action that
triggered her it&#39;s about realizing that
she&#39;s not okay with herself and the
amount of love that you feel towards her
is exactly what you need to show her
because that&#39;s what she doesn&#39;t believe
in herself another major thing I&#39;ve
picked up on is the way people use the
word anxiety antisocial actually means
to be immoral toward society or to want
to impair harm upon society not to just
want to be alone the word in itself is
misused to a great degree because the
extent to which anxiety can truly
dictate one&#39;s life is far beyond this
connotation to be aware of this misuse
brings me back to my initial point about
the impact of language on the individual
personally I can no longer say that a
certain situation is giving me anxiety
because I don&#39;t only understand but I
see those impacts on a daily basis
nor can I equate her sense of comfort in
being alone to her being antisocial
although I think social anxiety has
large impacts I also tried to make her
aware that she&#39;s no different from
anyone else and likewise can accomplish
anything she puts her mind to
finally my role is to show her that just
because social anxiety disorder is
abbreviated as sad she is most
definitely not characterized by those
three
overall the biggest part about being
that supporter is understanding the
person you care about most - essentially
grasp what it is that helps them because
every individual differs in what they
need the steps that I took are no form
of medical advice or a recommendation of
some sort or rather to show the
importance of being that supporter the
steps that I took began with identifying
it and not letting it be something that
just goes away with time in the initial
ideas of this talk not even at the TED
talk but just as an idea I felt I wanted
and needed to be aware of one of the
first things I looked up was social
anxiety misuse now instead of finding
articles on the true impacts of social
anxiety in contrast to the way anxiety
is used socially I found websites on
websites about how social anxiety will
ultimately lead to drug and alcohol
misuse to be categorized as someone
whose future it almost already
predetermined already weighs down
heavily on their self-esteem this was
the catalyst of my desire to learn about
the technicalities so as to link her
actions to some sense of reasoning
really for my own reassurance how do we
support her isn&#39;t a question I can
answer for anyone but myself which I
honestly can&#39;t even voucher I&#39;m doing
the best job ah but the reason I stand
up here and talk so passionately about
this is because it&#39;s hidden in many
aspects when someone is missing from
school one day just to come back the
next and say oh I was sick we believed
them because why question people but
that&#39;s also that wall that goes up with
people who face social anxiety disorder
and despite the fact that it&#39;s a
disorder in their head it doesn&#39;t mean
it doesn&#39;t exist although we think we
know people there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s unknown
thank you
