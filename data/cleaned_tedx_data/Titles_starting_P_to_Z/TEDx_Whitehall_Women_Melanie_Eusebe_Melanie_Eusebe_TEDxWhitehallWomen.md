every time I hear my own bio written or
read out to me I I always cringe it&#39;s so
difficult writing your own bio no I
think there&#39;s a really good business
idea and writing people&#39;s BIOS you could
actually have a branding or a PR firm
particularly for for women um I it&#39;s a
real pleasure to be here it&#39;s it&#39;s a
tough call actually to to do a TED talk
to be an expert but then also to lay
yourself bare on a stage so that you are
really connecting and and and making
sure that you are speaking with
something with impact and so it&#39;s a real
blessing to have all of you hear my
story a story that I&#39;ve never given in
public before we&#39;re talking about
bridges today and one thing I&#39;ve always
thought was that bridges are connect me
to something they connect me they bring
me somewhere and so what has brought me
through to where I am right now right
now arguably I am a successful woman
however I didn&#39;t only see myself that
way and I certainly know that other
people did not see me that way and so
for me resilience has been my most
important trait to acknowledge the fact
that bad things happen that they
happened to people they happen to women
in particular form they happen to
children and how do we recover when bad
things happen how do we not gloss them
over as a woman I was taught not to show
my anger not to show my temper and
certainly as a woman in the workplace I
was not allowed to cry and so how was I
to acknowledge when my boundaries had
been crossed how are we taught that as
young girls and young women so not only
will I speak on resilience being a
bridge to the other side of whatever you
are going through
but I want to get down to the practical
steps that I know I&#39;ve had to utilize
just to make it through just to get
there because sometimes all I want to do
is survive
it&#39;s not about thrive I just want to
make it to the end of the day so I had
this vision for my life I wanted to be a
big bad management consultant or at
least something in professional services
I&#39;m not gonna lie it had to have simply
with a degree because my mother you know
she I wanted to be an actress at first
and she was like oh no and so instead of
being a lawyer being a doctor I explored
them all I said you know what management
consultancy I get to fly around the
world I get to solve people&#39;s problems I
had a vision for my life and no matter
who tried to derail me and oh yes there
are many derailments and I&#39;m going to
talk about those surveillance in a
second I managed to get there and then
what happens you get there and you&#39;re
like this is actually what I really want
but I remember when I was doing a job
interview a long while back and I had
prepared to be a management consultant I
had networked my face off
I had gone to all of the big four
consultancies all of the networking
events my CV gone to headhunters I had
done master&#39;s degrees I had industry
experience and then I get in front of
the interviewer and he says to me second
question wow you&#39;re involved in
diversity stuff a lot are you just an
angry black woman and I remember and
what did I do afterwards
I laughed and I said oh of course not
in my head of course I was thinking this
is what makes me angry and of course in
my head I was thinking well of course
we&#39;re not allowed to be angry are we
because you don&#39;t even just just put my
handcuffs on me I&#39;m not even allowed to
be angry I remember walking home from
that interview I got the job at the end
of the interview didn&#39;t even need the
call but I cried I cried so long and so
hard because I thought I had worked so
hard
how many master&#39;s degrees that I have
how many organizations that I had to
how many TVs how many papers that I have
to write and the second question you ask
me is about being an angry black woman
you didn&#39;t ask me about my business
experience you didn&#39;t ask me about my
multiple passports you didn&#39;t ask me
about my Canadian accent you didn&#39;t even
ask me about my brown skin you asked me
about how if I was an angry black woman
I cried I cried long and I cried hard
and I was it was almost like this David
Banner scene with the music playing in
the background I was walking along the
Thames dude I thought and then I called
my squad my community I called my
girlfriend in New York and she flew over
the next day and she got together these
four other black women who were you know
doing things you&#39;re all young in our
careers then and we got together and
they got me through cuz I had someone to
cry with I had a community but there was
one thing I did I knew I needed despite
all of the all of the the troubles it
was the vision because I knew that no
matter what any person said to me I was
going to be a management consultant I
visioned it I put it on a board I had
pictures I knew and so there was no way
he was going to deter me from my path
the thing is I had a vision but I also
knew I had a history and I had legacy so
in developing resilience I would also
encourage you to look back at what your
ancestors what our ancestors have done
together we literally live in a country
that has a saying we&#39;ve made up this
saying keep calm and carry on like
that&#39;s the legacy of living here in this
country we know how to carry on if we
look at our great institutions that were
most proud of the NHS TfL the oldest in
the world and they&#39;re still here if you
think about what this country has gone
through we know how to survive we know
not only to how to survive we know how
to thrive if I look at my own ancestor
I came here in Chains and I&#39;m on your
stage if I look at my ancestors on a
greater level I think wait it there was
a whole genre of music a multi-billion
pound industry of music was based on the
fact that a school took away the
instruments and the music program from a
little school in New York and that&#39;s how
hip-hop was born because of lack that&#39;s
the history and legacy that I know I
have of my ancestors I know that with
women it&#39;s no longer about us not having
the ability or the cave scene perceived
ability to work
it&#39;s not about that&#39;s not voting anymore
because our ancestors fought for that
and so I know that there is a legacy of
change and advocacy in me that I can
keep on going so that&#39;s what helps me
fuel the vision and the resilience but
quite frankly I&#39;m not even gonna lie in
the middle of it it&#39;s hard to look at
the vision sometimes in the middle of it
you just gotta feel it and so I
encourage everyone in this room that
when you receive a blow don&#39;t shove it
aside
acknowledge it acknowledge the anger
that you feel acknowledge that there is
a boundary that&#39;s been crossed I&#39;m not
saying that you have to go off on a
mission and express it in an unhealthy
way but what I am saying is that anger
hurt and pain are ways that your body
and your spirit are telling you that
your boundary has been crossed and they
are healthy they are healthy and that is
how you develop resilience I was abused
for it for ten years
and for ten years when I was a child by
an extended family member and for 25
years there afterwards I said nothing
about it I lived it within my own secret
my own shame and it&#39;s only when I got
together with my three other extended
family member cousins and realized that
they had gone through the same thing I
had my community around me who was able
to say back to our parents hey you know
what this is what happened to us and we
were scared to tell you before
but now when we&#39;re 40 we&#39;re gonna tell
you it&#39;s so important to have that
community and that squad to up to uphold
you and that history in that legacy that
you can look back on surround yourself
with positive stories surround yourself
with stories of people who are doing
things who are getting through things
cuz by frankly there are enough stories
out there that are really really
negative so forget those ones you don&#39;t
need them you don&#39;t need otherwise
another tool I know that I practically
used in terms of resilience and
developing it is quite fun it&#39;s kind of
boring but hardwork grit if the success
does not come easy success does not come
in little short bursts is they all come
after short bursts of work either if you
look at some of the most amazing people
in their field so if you look at for
example JK Rowling and how many
manuscripts did she write and how many
times did she get rejected before the
one came through if you look at Michael
Jordan when he was cut from the high
school basketball team they must be
crying right now
Oprah Winfrey they told her that she
wasn&#39;t good enough for TV I have to
laugh because quite frankly you know
we&#39;re at the time right now if you&#39;re
and you&#39;re like say mid to late 20s
onwards that&#39;s where you see hard work
pay off it&#39;s not where you see it&#39;s not
about natural ability anymore it&#39;s it&#39;s
not like you know Jennifer Lopez
actually doesn&#39;t really sing that well
naturally and neither did Madonna I love
them but they took their lessons just
like everybody else and they worked
really really hard for it and so in
terms of being able to survive a blow
and survive a fall to get through to the
other side to bridge that gap you&#39;re
gonna have to just work hard for it but
know that everyone who&#39;s really good at
it
they work hard for it that&#39;s what makes
it worth it this summer I had one of the
most difficult summers ever I thought I
wasn&#39;t gonna make it here to the other
side between love and loss
family and friends I had an awards
program a national awards program and I
honestly didn&#39;t think I wasn&#39;t make it
through I was on my knees and that&#39;s how
I got Simone being one of them one of
the founders of TEDx Whitehall women
they brought me up they picked me up off
my knees I had a community of people my
mother she came over and she&#39;s here
right now she&#39;s in the audience I could
not go on without saying hi to my mother
in the audience she came over and she
helped me but I lost my home my family
my friends my money and I was on my
knees and then I had a community of
women who really up girded me and kept
me from falling and walked me to a place
where I could walk myself and that for
me is the core of my resilience the core
of how I get through to the other side
because I can&#39;t do it by myself and it
is such a beautiful satisfying place to
admit weakness to admit that I can&#39;t do
it all I am NOT the superwoman it&#39;s a
great place and they built authentic
relationships relationships that are
built on quite frankly showing your
backside to one another not showing that
you&#39;re perfect and so between hope and
history and legacy and community and
grit and hard work then those are things
that you can foster yourself to
anticipate and to not just survive but
thrive when the next blow comes thank
you
