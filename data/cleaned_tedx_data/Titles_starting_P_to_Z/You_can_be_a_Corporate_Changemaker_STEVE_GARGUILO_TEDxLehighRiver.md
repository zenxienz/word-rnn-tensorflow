I spent 8 years working for one of the
biggest companies in the world and the
last few years there I was in a pretty
visible role working with very senior
leaders of the company and c-suite
leaders and part of that meant being
part of their executive forums their
exclusive executive forums and so you
can imagine being in these big ballrooms
with lush white carpet and leather
chairs and big screens and all these
important people talking about the
future strategy and the future plans for
the company and inevitably one of the
things that would always come up would
be innovation and there&#39;d be
conversation about innovation and gosh
if only we could get our employees to be
more creative and to be thinking about
ideas imagine what the company would be
like ok so that would be the
conversation there then I would get back
to my office there was no more nice
white carpet my office had furniture
that was older than I am a phone that
was older than I am and I&#39;d have people
coming in to meet with me to share their
ideas and they&#39;d be going through their
idea and they&#39;d be talking about here&#39;s
what I want to do to make it happen
here&#39;s how we&#39;re gonna do this and
they&#39;d say gosh if only we could get the
senior leaders at this company to
embrace thinking about new ideas imagine
where we would be as a company and so
this contradiction is reality and this
contradiction is reality at many
organizations and even with the best
intention leaders oftentimes people feel
like the company they work for is this
company
so this company has the VP of status-quo
it has the director of bureaucracy
there&#39;s of course at the top the chief
idea killer now there is a manager of
new ideas but unfortunately that
position is vacant at the moment maybe
it&#39;ll get filled at some point soon how
many people here feel like sometimes you
work for this company and that&#39;s really
really unfortunate I think that&#39;s
actually really tragic and so what I
want to help you do today is think a
little bit differently about your work
environment and so to do that first we
have to go back we&#39;re gonna go way back
and were going to talk about how could
we have gotten to a point where
something like that work chart could
even be a reality well for most of human
history we were craftspeople or farmers
right and we worked outside and there
wasn&#39;t really the idea of a job we just
did what we needed to do to survive but
thanks to human ingenuity and creativity
we started creating tools that would
help make us more efficient in doing
things at home or doing things out in
the farm and so then we started making
tools to help us make those tools and
thus spawned the Industrial Revolution
over the last 200 years something of
course the Lehigh Valley is intimately
familiar with and as we started
manufacturing and interchangeable parts
it meant that we needed to train people
to be able to work in factories and
basically become interchangeable parts
and thus the Victorian era education
paradigm began where we teach kids to
sit in rows and raise their hands not
much has changed in that regard and
unfortunately the number one thing that
we teach people in this environments is
that the skilled you need to succeed in
the workforce is compliance and so
despite the fact that we&#39;re now 250
years later and we live in the era of
the gig economy in the freelancer and we
live in the era of AI and automation we
still have these legacy cultures of
compliance that are pervasive all around
our organizations and
there&#39;s this epidemic of smart minds
working on sometimes menial tasks
working to get things done and this
epidemic of people who say that things
like engagement and inclusion are very
important but it&#39;s more that those are
buzzwords and there&#39;s not anything that
we can do about it and it&#39;s become
normal for people to just go on Facebook
and post working for the weekend or TGIF
as if they&#39;re powerless victims to their
job well I firmly believe strongly and
wholeheartedly that no one is a
powerless victim to your job and that
there&#39;s something that you can do about
it to start to think about it
differently I study corporations big
ones and I&#39;ve cherry picked three
examples today that I want to share with
you of people who busted out of that
culture of compliance and people who
busted out of that environment to create
something really interesting I call
these people corporate changemakers and
I want to start with one story that if
we&#39;re honest this is we&#39;re all really
good stories start because this story
starts with Cheetos okay so imagine that
you were a custodial worker and you have
your mop in your bucket maybe you&#39;re a
little sign you&#39;re going about your work
trying not to interfere with anybody
well this describe the man named Richard
Montanez who was a janitor at frito-lay
the parent company for Cheetos and one
day he&#39;s at work and he&#39;s you know
working getting his business done and
the manufacturing line broke down it was
gonna be a pretty major fix and so they
were gonna have to discard the Cheetos
that had been going through and he&#39;s
like well I&#39;ll take some of those I&#39;ll
take some of those home but they were
plain Cheetos they hadn&#39;t yet been
coated with their iconic orange dust so
he has these plain Cheetos and he takes
them home he&#39;s that well enough very
good plane so he decides to put some
chili powder
on him and he&#39;s like these are pretty
good and he shares them with his kids he
shares him with some friends he&#39;s like I
think this this might be something I
think we should actually make something
happen and instead of thinking about hmm
what would my boss say in this situation
or you know that&#39;s not my job he decides
to go to
to the president of the company so the
president of frito-lay and he says
here&#39;s my idea well not only do they
make flamin hot cheetos now it&#39;s
actually their number one selling
product and richard has gone from being
a janitor to being a vice president at
the company alright our second story
comes from the world of health care may
be related to Cheetos maybe not and so
GE competes in many industries and one
of the industries that they compete in
is healthcare and one of the things that
GE Healthcare does is they make these
huge MRI machines anyone here ever had
an MRI right huge honkin pieces of
equipment and so there&#39;s a designer from
GE who worked on designing a machine
who&#39;s out at a hospital inspecting the
MRI machine and he&#39;s kind of going down
his list
check-check so he&#39;s feeling pretty good
it&#39;s meeting all the specifications kind
of Pat&#39;s himself on the back as he
starts to walk out of the hospital when
he hears a child screaming crying so he
turns back to see what&#39;s going on it was
a girl who&#39;s absolutely terrified of
having to have an MRI it can be
absolutely terrifying experience so Doug
asks the nurse is this is as common is
this something that you see a lot she
says oh yeah we see this all the time
80% of kids have to be enesta sized to
be able to go in to the MRI machine
which one is just terrible when you
think about having to put all these kids
under and to you can imagine from the
hospital&#39;s perspective you have to call
an anesthesiologist and wait it&#39;s very
disruptive to hospital operations so
despite the fact that this machine meets
all specs works 100% perfectly doug is
thinking to himself you know maybe
there&#39;s something that we can do
differently about this and so he comes
up with the idea for the pirate-ship
MRI experience complete with a skit a
little hat all kinds of things and they
were able to reduce the Anessa civ kids
down from 80% down to 7% and be able to
go from having kids scratch crying and
screaming to kids saying mom can we come
back to the pirate ship tomorrow
and imagine what MRI machine every
hospital wants now and so you can
imagine that GE has done pretty well
with this okay our third story comes
from a company that at this point I
would be shocked if not everyone in this
room is a customer of Amazon okay so
before Amazon was Amazon they were a
bookseller this is their original web
page and as they started becoming more
popular selling books they started to
explore other e-commerce avenues how can
we start selling other things online but
one of the biggest challenges there or
was the consumer behavior right because
we in the West have become become so
accustomed to we need something we go to
the store we get it and now we have it
and now you have to change that behavior
to I&#39;m going to order something I&#39;m
gonna pay for shipping and I&#39;m gonna
wait for it to arrive and so there this
challenge of like how do we get people
to actually want to pay for shipping and
to wait for the product to come well
software engineer named Charlie Ward had
an idea he said what about a
subscription service for fast free
shipping
well he took this idea to Jeff Bezos
Jeff Bezos loved the idea
and thus Amazon Prime was born and
Amazon Prime has not just shaped
Amazon&#39;s ecommerce business it&#39;s changed
the industries that they compete in and
it all started with one person so we
have custodian a designer a software
engineer none of these people was it
their job to think about those ideas
none of those people was it their job to
focus on that but it was their job to
show up to work every day thinking about
what can I do to make the biggest impact
towards the vision of the organization
and then they relentlessly pursued
making their idea happen so that could
have the greatest possible impact the
greatest ideas do not come from board
rooms filled with executives and
management consultants the greatest
ideas are buried in the hearts and the
minds of people going to work in the
organization&#39;s every day and we have to
encourage them to share it
tell them to share one of the most
tragic things that happens sometimes
when people have in ideas they share the
idea and they&#39;re met with what I like to
call snake face
so what snake face is you share an idea
with someone and all of a sudden their
eyes start to look like they just saw
one of those abandoned puppy commercials
like and they kind of sucked their mouth
back and it&#39;s often a company with that
hissing sound
yeah great idea but that&#39;s really
someone else&#39;s job maybe you should
focus on this the problem is it&#39;s not
somebody else&#39;s job because everybody&#39;s
just focused on their little thing and
we need the Richards of the world to say
yeah come on Cheetos and the hot chili
power let&#39;s do this like we need that
kind of thinking and that&#39;s the only
kind of thing that&#39;s gonna drive us
forward and so what you may be thinking
is like that all sounds great but who&#39;s
gonna do that well the person who&#39;s
gonna do that is you and it can only be
you you have the power to shape your
work environment and it can be starting
with the smallest of small things and
it&#39;s starting with any time you&#39;re in a
meeting sharing with somebody were like
wow that was really interesting can you
tell me more about that or if you get to
set up the meeting requiring people to
come to it with new ideas whatever it is
it&#39;s about starting with small things
and going from there what I wanted to
start trying to drive change within my
company I didn&#39;t have permission to do
that nobody asked me to do that no one
said that you can do that and yeah I was
worried that I&#39;d be viewed as some kind
of crazy heretic or scary rule-breaker
and maybe there were some snake faces
that thought that but the reality was
that the results start to speak for
themselves when you bring communities
together and you allow people to do
things we saw things like telemedicine
and mental health diagnosis and all
kinds of things and ended up actually
becoming my job to get to focus on this
kind of thing and I got to do
development programs and leadership
experiences and digital platforms and
the key to all of them working was this
idea of amplifying voices and writing
permission slips and encouraging people
to be able to make something happen and
helping them to actually do it we live
in an era of new power and everything
from the toppling of dictatorships in
the Arab Spring to the LGBT rights
movement to everything that you think of
starts with one person somewhere asking
a question or making a statement it
starts from the bottoms up so one last
example of that from a corporate
environment
you know now these days it&#39;s very in
vogue to talk about companies like
Amazon Google Facebook all these guys
but 2025 years ago there was a different
set of companies that was in vogue to
talk about that everyone to be like and
they were gonna be the future right one
of them was Microsoft and so 25 years
ago Microsoft they&#39;re firing on all
cylinders are incredibly successful they
say one of the things we want to do is
we want to create the world&#39;s best
encyclopedia and so they poached
University faculty from institutions
around the world they put their very
best engineers on it they put a lot of
money into it they said get to work go
create the world&#39;s best encyclopedia at
the exact same time a guy in his boxer
shorts sitting behind a computer monitor
said I want to create the world&#39;s best
encyclopedia does anybody want to help
Microsoft created in Carta which sits on
CD ROMs in landfills across the world
and wikipedia is now one of the most
visited sites on the internet the power
of grassroots the power of community are
far far greater than the power of
bureaucracy and of org charts and of
compliance and it all starts with giving
yourself a little bit of permission and
then giving out a little bit more
permission and then giving out a little
bit more permission so take today as
your permission slip okay the world is
waiting thank you
you
