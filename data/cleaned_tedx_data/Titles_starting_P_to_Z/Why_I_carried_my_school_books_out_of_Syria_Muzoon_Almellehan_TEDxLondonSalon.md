good evening everyone it&#39;s such a brief
list to be here as given while saying my
name is Mazzone I am a Syrian refugee I
came from Syria I think now all of you
you know Syria because unfortunately
what&#39;s happening in Syria it&#39;s war and
conflict and it&#39;s awful but let me start
with my own story and about my life
before the war and to let you know about
the reality of Syria and the country of
mine you know the reality of my country
actually when the war began in Syria our
life changed upside-down before the war
we had the normal life like you we were
going to school we were playing with our
friends we were visiting our relatives
we were thinking about our future we
were doing our daily activities without
worrying about anything in our lives of
course we had the challenges but we had
hope we had peace we had safety all
those things were in my country Syria
the country of Education the country
which has educated people the country
which is considered one of the best base
of civilizations as a country of which
has actually historical places but when
the war began everything changed
upside-down we had no access to
education we couldn&#39;t get in our basic
needs like food we were worried all that
time at any moment maybe you will die
you will lose your life you cannot do
anything just you have to worry all your
maybe to think if there will be bombings
today if we will be buttons today you
may be you cannot go to your world just
you have to think about that in the
world time but when we realize after
living two years in the war in Syria my
dad said it is going to be really hard
to live in Syria you will lose your
education also my father was working as
the teacher and you couldn&#39;t go to his
work as the teacher then when he lost
his job and the area where we living it
was really dangerous to stay where there
was bombings there was fighting so my
dad said we
to flee what do you said that I really
was really sad because they said if I
will leave my country I maybe I will
lose my education I don&#39;t know anything
about living in a refugee camp it&#39;s a
new thing to me I was just at the age of
13 and when he said that we want to
leave everything behind it was the
hardest decision in my life I didn&#39;t
want to leave my friends my relatives my
country where I was born but what made
me really sad it is my school I was
worried if I cannot continue my studies
in the refugee camp I realized if I lost
my education I would lose everything in
my life it would be it would be the end
of my story
but we had no choice but to flee when we
live my dad said you have just attack
with you the most important things the
things that you need most in the camp we
cannot carry heavy things because we are
going to walk we don&#39;t know what to do
in the way to Jordan because it was a
bit dangerous when it was war to flee to
another country I said yes I&#39;m gonna not
going actually to pack anything with me
but they said and they told myself just
pack my books my school&#39;s books they
were more than actually over ten books
it was I was at the grade nine and we
were studying we had many subjects I
said I will just pack my books and they
didn&#39;t actually pack anything else just
my books so when we were in the way to
Jordan we had to walk for three hours to
get to the border and my dad told me I
was actually struggling to KL to carry
my bag of course it is heavy because
where there were many books so yeah
actually when my dad came in he said do
you need the help
I said yes I need help and when he
carried the bag he said that is really
heavy what did you bring with you
Mazzone I said my books he said you are
really crazy
you know I told you don&#39;t you know pack
these things with you because you don&#39;t
need this books in Jordan and we don&#39;t
know what&#39;s gonna to have been in the
there&#39;s a new place I said if I didn&#39;t
find that school I will study by these
books because I know that honey of
education I know without education I
cannot do anything in my life
I cannot achieve my hopes and dreams and
they cannot actually achieve anything it
is gonna to be the end of my story and
that&#39;s what I realized when I was just
at the age of 13 so we arrived to the
camp where we had many challenges it was
really tough life we had no access to
electricity we had to bring water from a
very distant place we lived in tent
where we had to do everything in a tent
you have to sleep you have to do you all
your activities than 110 and there was
no electricity of course there was no
internet and there is nothing but for me
I didn&#39;t care about those challenges and
what I was thinking about the school so
I asked the people there where is the
school can I continue my studies in a
refugee camp and when they said yes that
moment changed my life i anew by
education I can change this difficult
situation when I went to school at the
camp and the twelve my first day there I
expected every child in the cam loves
the school and wants to go to school and
they are really pleased to come back to
education and to have opportunity to
study but unfortunately I noticed and
they saw parents girls and boys who
don&#39;t believe in education who thinks
education does not priority when we
became refugees and they know their
lives are really tough because they had
war and they are suffering in the camp
they think that it is the end of their
lives
and they don&#39;t want to study but that
made me really sad and really shocked
because when I saw those people who
don&#39;t believe in education I know it is
gonna to be a disaster for my country
and for the people themselves so if they
don&#39;t study if they didn&#39;t get an
education then that will affect their
future that will make
them really week without education so I
told myself to make a change in general
we think we are young or everyone thinks
that I don&#39;t have the ability to make a
change I am NOT the strong enough to
make a change or I think about others to
start and make a change or to come to me
and to change me or to advise me to to
study for example or to go to school but
for me I told myself I have to make a
change I have to convince them to
believe in education and to consider
education as a priority because as a
person who believes in education and as
they consider education as a priority
I consider it important for others
myself for example my country doesn&#39;t
need just to Mazzone as an educated
person
it needs the whole generation every
child should go or must go to school to
have education and to have knowledge to
be able to go back and rebuild our
country Syria doesn&#39;t need to be able
who lost their hopes it needs doctors it
needs engineers and it needs teachers it
needs those people who really care about
Syria in the future so I said I want to
go and to speak with them and to go from
tent to tent and to speak in my
classrooms at the school and to speak
with every person at any time and any
place to convince them to believe in
education and that&#39;s what they did
actually I was going to speaking with
people and I was telling them about the
importance of education and the value of
learning and going to school and if we
have a chance to go to school we have to
take this chance because education is
such an essential part in our lives if
we lost education we would lose if we
think in our lives because education is
the only thing which gives everything it
is the way to make peace it is the way
to have hope so without education we
cannot do anything and most importantly
for me when I lived my country when I
left everything behind
I didn&#39;t flee my home of things of my
making the warrior I didn&#39;t make war and
it was not my fault to lose my rights
I don&#39;t accept war to take of me my
rights especially my right of education
I don&#39;t accept people who forced me to
flee my home to be happy when
I am NOT educated person I want to
approve to everyone that even if I have
it challenges in my life I have to face
those challenges to make a difference
not only for me I&#39;m when I talk I don&#39;t
talk about Mazzone of course I talk
about every child all over the world of
course not only Syrians those who cannot
go to school who don&#39;t have access to
education not only education to other
rights like to have access to food to
have access to clean water for example
and many things so when we talk we don&#39;t
talk about me because now I&#39;d present
them I represent their challenges so
that&#39;s why I started to prove to
everyone in the world and to show
everyone in the world that even if we
became refugees even if we had the
challenges in our lives we still have
hope we still have dreams we have to
achieve them but we need you to help us
to stand with us and to hear our voices
and that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing to live each
voice in the world to be heard and to
prove that they deserve our attention
and they deserve to help them so after
living three three years and the cams
and all my activities actually drew
attention to many organizations
including UNICEF and many people when I
was a speaking also in media to talk
about refugees and other issues in the
camp of course about my campaign about
education I became an unarmed person so
then I became a trend with Malala
yousafzai who also an education activist
and who is considered a sample of
education we became a friends when she
came accident visited every camp at that
time and the people in the camp actually
was calling me Malala of Syria and they
were so yeah I was so proud to have that
name because Malala stood show
remarkable young women who did and she&#39;s
the still of course done lots of things
for education and to fight for this
valuable rights we have shared we have
shared goals and we did lots of things
together when I came to UK so after I
lived in the Kam&#39;s I came to UK and now
I&#39;m with my family we are living in a
Newcastle with the tough accent with the
Geordie accent as given actually
staying and yeah we came here but when I
stopped my in your life here and I also
started to think about my education
about my university about my knowledge
of course they haven&#39;t forgotten those
who are still behind me I feel so lucky
to have access to education I feel lucky
to go to school every day also I feel
lucky to have my family with me but what
about those who cannot go to school who
are still living in camps who are still
suffering to have access to their right
and of course it&#39;s big education one of
the rights that the people and the
children all over the world cannot have
access to it so when I came here also I
started again I use my first as as much
as I can to speak out like what I&#39;m
doing today and to also to let people
know about refugees because
unfortunately many people in UK and
Yoruba new as they don&#39;t know anything
about refugees they don&#39;t know about
their challenges maybe we here at refuge
it&#39;s just a name or the meaning of
something that the person who fled a
home or a person who has no rights just
he needs the help all the time
this is not try I tried to tell people
about the reality of a refugee refugee
in the past I was thinking it is a
shameful thing to be a refugee but I
want just to say that a refugee is
really a strong person I don&#39;t say that
because I am a refugee but because a
refugee is a person who really want want
to do actually to flee from Tora who
wanted to flee from danger stay blessed
to start a new life because the refugee
is a person who believes in life and
believes that he has the mission in this
world to do or to play so when we fled
our homes we fled with our hopes as well
so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to actually
tell the people to world leaders
decision-makers anyone who cares to help
those who are suffering right now so
after doing many activities with Malala
as I was saying before and after that I
started there again with UNICEF first I
have traveled with them to Chad which is
the country in Africa and it shad is one
of the countries actually
has lack of resources lack of education
many children especially girls cannot go
to school so when I went there I was
really pleased to hear stories from
those people and even though there were
aware actually many challenges I found
hope I found people who really want to
build their countries people who want to
go to school despite all the challenges
that they have searched that was one of
the missions and one of the experiences
actually I really loved and now I&#39;m
trying also to raise the force of
children and child all over the world so
afterwards after traveling with UNICEF
to chair they appointed me as their
youngest goodwill ambassador and first
refugees who become actually becomes
actually a goodwill ambassador for
UNICEF and now I&#39;m a global want to
fight for education for children&#39;s
rights
and I&#39;m travelling with them all over
the world my mission is to represent
those who don&#39;t have voice who are
voiceless and cannot speak in front of
you for example today who cannot
represent themselves so I hope my story
can make a difference for their lives I
hope what I&#39;m doing that could help them
because they really don&#39;t want to be
just a title as a goodwill ambassador or
just an activist by a name I really want
to make a difference in their lives
because it is really important actually
to represent the children to talk about
their issues but most importantly we
have to help them and they will do that
forever and of course my studies will
helped me a lot to fight more and I hope
that actually to to do something for
those two children and this is started
with you today and hope every one of you
thinks more about those who are
suffering and we hope to take seriously
these issues because maybe your voice
your help maybe just a message from you
of hope or will coming ere fu G or
giving an opportunity it makes a huge
difference in lives of many of your
children so thank you so much
you
you
