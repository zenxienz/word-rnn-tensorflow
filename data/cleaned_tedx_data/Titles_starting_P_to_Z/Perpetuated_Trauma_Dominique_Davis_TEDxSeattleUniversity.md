hi my name is Dominic Davis like he said
I am the CEO and co-founder of an
organization called community
passageways this organization called
community passageways that we created in
January we are doing work in schools
we&#39;re doing work in detention centers
we&#39;re doing work in courtrooms and we&#39;re
doing work in the community
the common denominator through that line
of work we&#39;re doing is called
peacemaking and healing circles and
that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to talk to you
about today talk about dealing with the
trauma that we&#39;re dealing with in our
community that we usually don&#39;t have
space to talk about or deal with first
in the schools I did a program called
men on the move up in Kent Washington in
there was about 60 young men of color
that they brought out of school to spend
the day at the superintendent&#39;s office
so towards the end of the program they
asked me to do hour-long peacemaking a
healing circle to show the kids you know
what it&#39;s like give them the experience
so when I broke them up into small
groups there was about 15 grown men from
the school district there too and we
split them up into small groups with the
young men in I started asking questions
I talked total peacemaking the healing
circles are something that you sit down
and you get to be vulnerable you get to
be transparent we get to talk about your
issues that you&#39;re dealing with so so
the first question you&#39;re going to talk
to your group about will be have you
ever had a positive male role model in
your life or a negative male role model
in your life and how do you feel about
them and there was a powerful moment
because you&#39;ve seen a whole roomful of
young black and brown men start putting
their heads down the shoulder start
dropping cuz they&#39;ve never really
thought about that the next question I
asked him was have you ever had a
positive or male role model ever tell
you that they love you have they ever
hugged you and told you that they&#39;re
proud of you the room got even more
quiet more depressing heads went lower
as I watched the kids past the talking
piece around
tears started coming out of their eyes
because they realize I&#39;ve never had that
and then they realize how bad they
wanted towards the end I told all the
men to get up come to the middle of the
room let&#39;s make a circle because every
one of you young men are gonna come and
hug us and we&#39;re gonna tell each other
we love each other
one of the most powerful moments that
I&#39;ve ever seen in this work that I do a
bunch of young men hugging other grown
men that were positive role models and
we&#39;re telling each other we love each
other
those kids are squeezing you tight they
needed that so bad this is the kind of
trauma that we&#39;re dealing with with our
young adults in our schools in our
community so after I did that they asked
me to go to a school asked me to go to a
couple of schools actually so the first
school I went to they said okay we can
you work with our teachers and our staff
so I said yeah I&#39;d started doing a
training with the teachers of staff
towards the end of the training I broke
them up in the circles I said you have
to experience what we&#39;re gonna be taking
your students do so they broke up into
circles and I told them to sit with
people that you really don&#39;t know or
speak to so as they did that I started
wanting to I figured I got to break
their walls down because they&#39;re gonna
come with their walls up we all do that
we all come with our own insecurities
and we don&#39;t want to share with
strangers so I said I want you to talk
about somebody that you love talk about
somebody that you just care about and
until your group why you love that
person that&#39;s easy
I can feel any stranger how much I love
somebody so they started doing that this
laughter is joining the room then the
next question I said was now I want you
to talk about that same person but I
want you to tell your group what gets on
your nerves about that person what makes
your skin crawl
when they do something let&#39;s talk about
that so then the dynamic started
changing a little bit but what I did was
I broke their walls down cuz they just
set up and told some strangers some
personal business but it was easy then
the third question was now I want you to
talk about your darkest moment in your
childhood the darkest moments you&#39;ve had
that you carry with you since your
childhood that you don&#39;t even like to
think about that should bury now the
whole dynamics of the room changes now
there&#39;s tears now there consoling each
other passing out tissue then I said
okay now I want to ask you who all in
this room feels like you know the people
you&#39;re sitting with better now than you
did when you walk through the door and
they all raise their hand and that&#39;s
when I told them that&#39;s the kind of
relationship you should have with your
students you should know your students
you should be transparent to your
students you should have conversations
with your students then I said now what
I want you to do is take that darkest
moment in your childhood that you just
shared with your group and I want you to
think about that child that you keep
picking out of class and send it to the
principal&#39;s office and keeps getting
suspended those two or three or four or
five kids that you know at twelve
o&#39;clock he&#39;s gonna come in that room and
you&#39;re gonna be looking for him to do
something wrong and think about that kid
going through the same trauma that you
just shared times 10 every day and then
that kid walking into your classroom and
then the way you react to that kid think
about that how would you like an adult
to react to you the same way you react
to that kid when you were in that dark
moment you just talked about tears
everywhere shame and guilt everywhere I
took that same group of teachers I took
a handful of those teachers and I took a
handful of those students and I put them
together in a circle then we started
having a conversation and as we rotated
around the circle and we started sharing
our stories the teachers started
realizing this kid over here
witnesses friend get killed this friend
over here is Frank I killed a year ago
and he&#39;s struggling through it this kid
over his father been abusing and beating
them this kid over here is going through
this and that all this trauma these kids
are going through but at the same exact
time you&#39;re finding out that the
teachers are dealing with cancer dealing
with suicide their brother committed
suicide my daughter&#39;s on drugs my
cousin&#39;s in the penitentiary and my mom
is just died and so now all the time the
teachers are dealing with
they&#39;re sharing this with each other our
in in that circle everybody was crying
so bad that I had to take a break and I
said no everybody get up in her these
teachers started saying different words
about the same students they were saying
we&#39;re bad or they were a problem or they
were issued the same students that was
getting kicked out of class are now
being called brave and resilient and I
don&#39;t know how you do it I don&#39;t know
how you get up every day and come to
school it changes the dynamics of how I
look and how we look at each other now
the teachers are looking at the students
and now everybody&#39;s been humanized to
each other
you&#39;re just not another statistic or
number or just not another kid in my
class now when I see you and you see me
we have empathy for each other because
we know something about we communicate
it with each other we have a deeper
relationship so instead of me kicking
her out of my class I must step you out
know how I say are you okay today how
you feeling I know you&#39;re going through
a lot what can I do to help you instead
of go to the principal&#39;s office get out
of my class
those stories that I&#39;m telling you that
story I just told you to me and more
stories I&#39;m getting ready to tell you
you need to understand that we have to
change the dynamics of how we think and
operate and the way we do that is
through humanizing each other and
building relationship with each other no
matter what race creed color it doesn&#39;t
matter we do work in the detention
center also I&#39;m gonna talk about one
moment that just sticks with me more
than I&#39;ve had a ton of these moments but
this moment I like to tell this story
because I was sitting with a group of
young ladies I usually work with a whole
lot of young men and and and I just
started working more with young ladies
but this group of young ladies were all
in jail and they were young 13 14 15 16
years old and they&#39;re sitting here in
their jail uniform and I&#39;m and when they
all walk in the room I got like 10 or 12
of them they all walk in a room and I&#39;m
looking at him going what could happen
what could these kids have possibly done
to be locked up they&#39;re just babies I
started talking to him I started having
a circle I said to him
I&#39;m gonna talk to you like I talked to
my daughter&#39;s I want you to understand
that you are beautiful you are brilliant
you are intelligent you are not these
uniforms that you have are you are not
this prison number that they&#39;ve given
you you are somebody that God has
blessed with power you know when you get
out of here I want you to tap into the
power and the beauty that you have I&#39;m
gonna talk to you like my daughters and
they all started cryin I got a room full
of young ladies all in tears crying in
prison uniforms and the little girl said
yes please talk to me like you&#39;re my dad
I never had one
another little girl said you&#39;re just
like a dad to me
I remember the words you say when you
come and talk to us I&#39;ve only seen her
three times and her young life another
little girl said I&#39;ve never been called
beautiful before especially by no man
another little girl said how can you say
to trust God of gods of man some of the
most powerful statements out of these
babies I walked out of there thinking
about how crazy our system is and how
there&#39;s no way these children should be
locked up these are our kids we have to
start dealing with the trauma of our
young adults we have to start doing with
it that&#39;s how the system will change we
have been able to this work to step our
foot into the court rooms now we are
going in and literally pulling kids that
have cases pending out of the court
rooms we have been able to get kids who
have felonies on their back
felonies dropped taking them to peace
making inhuman circles wrapping services
around them putting a team of mentors
around them getting them back in school
getting them jobs taking the go speak
and tell their story at different events
and different venues we write a new
narrative and put it in front of a
prosecutor because all the prosecutor
got is a case but once we take that kid
and take that kid to a system dealing
with the trauma first we put a new
narrative in front of that prosecutor
that prosecutor has something to see
something to read about that kid instead
of a crime
there are people in the system that are
willing to work with us work with the
community long as the community steps up
and is ready to work with our kids and
take our kids out of this system we have
a voice and we have to use it one of the
things that is standing out to me is
that now that I have prosecutors I have
judges I have defense attorneys
I have probation officers all willing to
come in and do circles with us we are
taking a kid that had three or four
felonies on their back putting them in a
circle with all the problem with the
systems people with the victim and we&#39;re
having circles and we&#39;re getting cases
dropped and getting the kid off to the
right track that&#39;s way more powerful and
it&#39;s locking these kids up this is the
focus we have to have the focus needs to
be healing we have to get away from this
punitive system that is doing nothing
but creating a whole nother generation
of new prisoners and we have to start
healing our kids healing our community
healing our young adults as long as we
change our mindset and realize we have
to operate out of love and give people
second and third and fourth chances
because we have to understand it&#39;s our
fault that these kids are traumatized
we&#39;re the ones that run the community
where the runs that were in the system
and until we start pulling people in the
system out and make them sit down with
community and build relationship we&#39;re
going to keep building a new generation
of prisoners I want you guys to
understand as long as we stay operating
the way we have our country will never
be successful this is not success this
is not success we have more people in
prison than any other country in the
nation that is not a successful country
we have a prison industrial complex that
operates out of racism and bias and we
know that but if we can get those same
people that work within that system to
step out of that system and sit down and
build community relationship with the
same people that they are trying to lock
up we can change it we can
break it we can break the system down
but community has to step up and say
give us our kids give us our young
adults we&#39;re here and we&#39;re going to
operate in another way and change our
mindset and change your mindset thank
you
