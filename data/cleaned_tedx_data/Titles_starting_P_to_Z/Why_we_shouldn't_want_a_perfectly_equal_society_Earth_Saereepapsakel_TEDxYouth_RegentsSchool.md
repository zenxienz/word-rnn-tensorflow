I have to admit I do have a bad haircut
this what you get from going to a
reserve officers training course with
militaristic society where everyone is
equal and treated all the same however
it is unfair of course were sought to be
forced to have the same haircut
but oh well Who am I to judge equality
is the state of everyone being equal
such as by status
whereas fairness it&#39;s about impartial
and just treatment or behavior without
favoritism or discrimination the world
in most societies and neither a
completely eco society like the
idealistic communist society where
everyone is theoretically equal nor a
completely fair society of course
socially and economically nobody says
that the world is a fair place but a
socially and economically equal society
should never be aim for a listen gents
I&#39;m here this evening to convince you
why that is the case a successful system
requires a correct magazines mechanism
to run the human species is a
cooperative one in fact many studies
that attempt to discover our inherent
selfishness fail to do so this is good
news since a society weather being
perfectly equal of fair not still
require actual people to run
however some studies have also found out
that behind our natural impulses to
behave cooperatively it&#39;s actually our
expectations of rewards and benefits in
simple words perhaps there is no such
thing as a selfless act after all as it
is all driven by our hope for warts and
self-satisfaction so how is this a bad
things yes well how do we know what
those incentives are is it just say
blissful feelings you get from helping
people or it&#39;s a nice anticipation that
those actions will somehow benefit you
in the future and since this since the
authority&#39;s decision is decided by
actual people how do we know if those
decisions under n&#39; by selfishness and
since these questions regarding our
uncertainties can be erased perhaps
we&#39;re not entirely perfect or even good
by our fundamental nature in governing
ourselves in an eco and fair manner also
many studies and theory is a point out
that we are competitive by our nature in
fact in most societies where different
jobs could mean different value and
different income this nature drives us
to work hard and climb those social
hierarchy steps to better ourselves in
economics in a competitive market is
what pushes the firm&#39;s to improve and
produce new inventions as well as making
a market more progressive similarly a
competitive society is what makes a
progressive society in pushing people to
work harder
but in an equal society where a pilot
would earn the same income si toilet
cleaner
would anyone work harder the society
might as well just collapse or simply
stagnate with no sense of forward
movement so I have it that way
historically many countries have
attempted to become from their point of
view of course a fair and equal state
mostly through communism despite some
success many ended up failing the first
failure if Explorer is the Soviet Union
which was one of the earliest
large-scale at him of widespread peer
equality among his people the USSR&#39;s
economy were designed to be as equal as
possible meaning that there was a lack
of free market and I according to an
economic theory a lack of free market is
what leads to a decline in economic
efficiency as this means not only lower
consumption and investment the main
contributors to the country&#39;s GDP but
also less government surplus and income
from the tax revenue also many
historians and economists have pointed
out that this is in fact one of main
contributions to their collapse in 1991
as free market forces something that the
Soviets lack of is necessary to make an
economy work evidently we can see it it
has this has damaged them greatly as
they have to let go of the entire
Eastern Europe region of the Soviet
occupation zone why
because it was simply too expensive for
them to run in a socialist state lake
China however who approves free-market
their GDP skyrocketed to the world&#39;s
second-largest for nearly 40 years
since they opened themselves up to
foreign trade investments and free
markets they became the world&#39;s
fastest-growing country in 1979 the year
that they opened themselves up to these
things I mean this is not even a
long-term thing where you we&#39;re like
what five years of something being
accomplished once it&#39;s open the game is
on good job China well as you can see
these points appear said an eco society
like the Communists and socialists state
would not work and that they are far
from what we really want but do we want
an unfair and unequal society well in
short no would you want to live in a
world like East Germany where similar to
Orwell&#39;s 1984 the political elites get
to live in a fancy apartments where as
citizens the common people equally live
in a square apartment and equally
forbidden from restricted areas reserved
especially for the political elites or
would you want to live in a society
where people decided what class you
belong in to since your birth as well as
removing your rights of marrying others
outside your class simply because of
what your parents were at the bottom of
the caste system like they were and yet
used to have
moving on the definition of social
equality is that everyone is being given
the same amount of opportunities as
sewers right which can be in the form of
land properties ownership or wealth
regardless to their contribution towards
a society which sometimes to build a
socially fair society social equality
must be sacrifice would you want to live
in the world where the harder you work
the higher income you were earned and
the more you get to spend on what you
want and relatively the one who worked
less yet to earn less and spend less
this means that your hard work and
effort correlates with your access to
certain opportunities so perhaps a
little bit of inequality among us to be
a good thing right perhaps to be enough
a thing this also shows that a fair
society is not necessarily the same
thing as an equal society but we want to
live in a world where whoever has the
most money is untouchable and above the
law well no of course no and I will not
read the definition of a socially fair
society either the definition of
economics equality is not conducive in
incentivizing people to work harder as
there&#39;s no reward for excellence
additional effort or superior ideas and
as there is no incentives for us to work
harder
humans are likely to see any reason to
put in this extra effort such as those
found in the free market
as it would often flourish in the
competition and adversity which as we
looked at the Soviet Communism where our
firms and productions are centralized
and controlled by a single organization
the government of course markets
stagnate and a quality of life did not
improve therefore to remote progress and
improvements economics equality must be
sacrifice as well to some extent well I
don&#39;t mean to the extent of letting
crush into run wild like some African
dictatorships but in a controlled and
regulated way like the country is at the
top of the economics freedom index list
like Hong Kong Singapore New Zealand
great countries in economic theory one
of the main government objectives is
economic growth and not stagnant economy
which having to this we could say that
economics EcoRI does not make any
economic sense as it does not promote
this vital growth at all whereas in an
economically fair society there would be
a fair distribution of opportunities
among the citizens as it is only your
drive and skills which dictate your
success so what do you think well
that&#39;s a lot to take in linking back to
our theme of fairness and equality
socially and economically controversial
comment on social equality is not what
we should be looking for wait wait wait
it&#39;s not what you think
everybody absolutely should have equal
rights but that is not what social
equality is to be clear social equality
is the idea that every citizens being
given and enjoy is the same amount of
opportunities regardless once again
regardless of their contributions to
what society I have into this
perhaps the Utopia that we all should be
looking for it&#39;s a balanced Society
sorry
and that some elements of social
inequality must exist if we want a
socially fair society and as some
elements of social inequality must exist
as well if we want a socially fair
society with freedom and incentives to
work and act and live with herpes we
also see that economic equality is
ironically canary to economic freedom
and it&#39;s not what to look for when we
won the market and the entire country to
progress and so the tsardom elements of
economic inequality is compulsory for
fair progressive and free economy lie
Confucius once said balance is the
perfect state of the water at every to
this perhaps the Utopia we all should be
looking for it&#39;s a balanced society that
is not too extreme in other way
similarly we all should find balance in
ourselves
I know I know you&#39;ve heard this a
thousand times from your parents or yoga
teacher but really really balance is
everything similar to the current or
past society system humans are imperfect
as we can see actually perfection never
really exists we can try to be as much
fair as possible but complete fairness
it&#39;s not 100% impossible and so since we
are imperfect balance is probably the
only solution for us all to live in
harmony in an imperfect yet balanced
society thank you
