what values will you stand for what
legacy will you leave behind how will
you be remembered these questions form
the core of our identity whether were
employees entrepreneurs or leaders and
to understand why we&#39;re different from
this sea of people who have want and do
the exact same thing is us I delved into
the different industries and how they
create unique connections with their
customers and what I found was a
perspective so simple but profound I
believe it can transform our presence if
you look at the world of art why is it
that paintings continue to tell stories
long after their creators are gone you
see it&#39;s not just because they&#39;re
beautiful to look at
but because of how they make people feel
how they make people feel for instance
Picasso&#39;s Guernica is such a remarkable
painting not just because it&#39;s a very
interesting painting of distorted body
parts but because of the feeling it
conveys the angst the devastation that
was caused by the Nazi bombing of
Guernica in Spain it represented a
strong political message and that&#39;s what
people connected with the Last Supper by
Leonardo da Vinci was remarkable not
just because it was a beautiful painting
of 13 biblical characters having dinner
but because of something else the
underlying feeling of deceit suspense
premonition because Jesus had revealed
that one of them was going to betray him
when I saw things from this perspective
it made me realize something
you and I we are much like these
paintings aren&#39;t we we spend a whole
life of hard work creating a career
painting it masterfully with credentials
and titles but do these titles alone
make us memorable or can we create a
presence one that not only reflects what
we do but the values we believe in the
legacy we want to leave behind and how
we want to be remembered and for this to
understand this better let&#39;s now look at
the most prominent brands in the world
and how they connect with their
customers and why I bring you to this is
if you look at all these brands they
convey a feeling that is so strong so
deeply connected with their customer
that that feeling becomes synonymous
with the brand just do it Nike because
you&#39;re worth it
L&#39;Oreal think different Apple do you see
how unique each connection is take Nike
for instance just do it wants me to feel
motivated and energized and excited and
what does all of that have to do with a
shoe I mean it&#39;s a shoe so while we know
that these are marketing strategies just
think for a second how much work it was
to make you care about what&#39;s mostly
rubber and plastic their connection with
you is about trust and loyalty even love
because they go beyond the product and
service that they provide their focus is
not over the number one in business or
best price guaranteed their focus is we
want you to feel something that whatever
you&#39;re challenged when you put on your
Nikes you can do anything that was Nike
what about you
you are no different just like them you
represent a set of skills and services
but to create that unique presence go to
the next level and ask yourself how do I
want people to feel when they work with
me what feeling will be synonymous with
me that&#39;s different from everyone else
who does the same thing that I do now we
all have heard many extraordinary
success stories of millionaires and CEOs
and founders so today to highlight my
message I&#39;d like to share a few stories
of ordinary people with you people who
found that feeling and transformed that
presence and the first story is about a
man that I wish you knew my late
grandfather or Dada G as I called him
the other G was born in a small town in
India one of nine brothers and sisters
and when his father passed away at an
early age he had to take the
responsibility of caring for his family
eventually he became an engineer and he
lived by three ideals in life always
work with honesty and integrity always
treat people with respect regardless of
the issue and always be there for your
team in 1989 when the Audigy passed away
the employees of that organization felt
like they had lost a father it&#39;s been 28
years since he left us but to this day
people remember how safe how protected
they felt underneath his leadership his
juniors then who are now in their late
70s still invite my mother to their
family gatherings to represent the other
G&#39;s presence so if you ask me that is an
unforgettable legacy because he
continues to live in the hearts and
minds of his people the second story is
about what happens when we struggle to
connect
with what defines us when we struggle to
find this feeling I was approached by a
finance director a couple of months ago
who had extensive experience in banking
she had taken some time off to take care
of her children once they were older she
wanted to get back in the game but no
luck she could not get a job however
hard she tried despite all her talent
now here&#39;s the thing when we were having
our conversation I heard all about her
experience all about her strategies and
leadership but all I saw was a long
bullet list I couldn&#39;t get a sense of
who she was what her identity was so we
had to start from scratch how do you
want people to feel when they work with
you what feeling will be synonymous with
you and as we gradually peeled layer
after layer we discovered something
incredible she was a woman who loved
being in the middle of chaos and she
wanted her team to trust her like the
captain of a ship in a storm because in
the unpredictable stormy world of
Finance she wanted to bring him her
clarity her vision her creative energy
to sail her team through those rough
waters that is what made her come alive
that is what made her an excellent
director and that&#39;s the kind of leader
that a bank needs when we were done she
said you know all these years I thought
I knew myself I just never thought of
myself this way within a month of that
she got offers from two companies one
small question can transform the way you
present yourself and the third and final
story that I want to share with you is
well about the person in front of you
because why do I care about this so from
an early age I&#39;ve been passionate about
bringing ideas to life whether through
debating storytelling speaking it made
me feel so alive
but when I decided to pursue my career
in it that&#39;s where I made a big mistake
because I started shaping myself on
other success stories on what other
successful people and speakers were
doing so technically I was just being a
second-rate version of someone else
and despite what I loved doing I
couldn&#39;t speak at the platforms I wanted
I couldn&#39;t be with the clients that I
wanted to work with and at one point I
thought this is not going anywhere I
might as well just quit
but the moment of epiphany came when I
did a self intervention I had to
confront myself and literally write down
on a piece of paper what is different
about me how do I want people to feel
when they worked with me and that&#39;s when
I realized the feelings that I want to
give people okay I want people to feel
powerful alive and radiant when we work
together this is me this is what I want
to give and once I discovered that I
reach ange dand reshaped everything my
keynotes my workshops every time I
discussed and presented myself
everything changed and while I&#39;m not
where I want to be I can tell you that
I&#39;m on the right path that one question
changed a lot of things in my life as
well
ladies and gentlemen Albert Einstein
once said that try not to be a man of
success but to be a man of value right
now we all have credentials that make us
good at what we do but to be remarkable
unforgettable ask yourself how do I want
people to feel when they work with me
what is that one feeling that will be
synonymous with me now chances are most
of us have rather ordinary lives we
don&#39;t have those crazy Kilimanjaro
stories or the rags to riches
transformations but that&#39;s fine just
because we don&#39;t have that doesn&#39;t mean
that we can&#39;t have an incredible
presence because right now I see
hundreds
of inspiring stories waiting to be told
I see hundreds of identities waiting to
be transformed so all you need to do is
think different and just do it because
you&#39;re worth it thank you
