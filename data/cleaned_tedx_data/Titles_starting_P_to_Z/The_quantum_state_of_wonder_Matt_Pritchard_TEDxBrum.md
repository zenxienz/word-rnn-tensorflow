next time you find yourself with two
polystyrene cups just stick them bottom
to bottom like this then get some tape
and wrap the tape around the cups the
next thing you&#39;re going to need is a
broken elastic band wrap the elastic
band around twice and you&#39;ve made a
catapult
pull it back let go thank you surprise
is a wonderful way of grabbing people&#39;s
attention surprise + mystery is a great
way of grabbing their thinking let me
give an example of something I use in
schools with science teaching I&#39;ve got
this wheel here and you&#39;ll notice as a
ramp going uphill if I place it at the
top it will roll down if I place it at
the bottom it will roll up so possibly
your first reaction is wow and then we
rapidly move on to there how how does it
work so let me tell you how it works
it&#39;s really simple we&#39;ve got a thin
string running off stage into the wing
starts pulling it now let me tell you
how it works it&#39;s magnets embedded in
the wheel and magnets in the board and
it&#39;s it&#39;s going like this there&#39;s an air
jet over the side pushing up this helium
inside the wheels it&#39;s a hamster running
furiously here&#39;s the thing I believe
we&#39;re too quick to move to an
explanation too quick to skip over that
fragile middle ground between the Wow
and the how that state of knowing and
not knowing that state where magic
exists where curiosity is given free
rein and it saddens me that so many
people have lost that curious spirit my
daughter behind me on the screen a bit
older now she&#39;s three she came back from
nursery school recently and now she can
no longer wear her dinosaur trainers
because apparently girls aren&#39;t allowed
to wear
dinosaurs I know my daughter is learning
from an early age that society&#39;s
expecting her to conform that
possibilities are being shut down for
people and projecting forward into the
future she&#39;s going to go to school soon
and she&#39;s going to learn that play time
equals break time with his underlying
message that play and learning us
somehow separate and she&#39;ll be ranked
she&#39;ll be scored she&#39;ll be assessed at
school she will learn her place in the
classroom she&#39;ll learn her place in
society those tests will test her
ability to regurgitate quick simple
answers unknowns will be boxed up placed
off-limits or hidden away and she&#39;ll
learn the consequences for making
mistakes socially academically
financially she&#39;ll learn to keep her
head down her internal motivation will
be swapped out for an external
carrot-and-stick motivation and as she
goes on to the world of work she will be
uncomfortable with the unknown she&#39;ll be
uncomfortable with complex situations
she will want and she&#39;ll give quick
simple answers she&#39;ll be risk-averse not
wanting to stick her neck out that&#39;s not
why I want for my daughter that&#39;s not
what I want for any child you see
education for me is not about giving the
answer it&#39;s not about giving the answers
education it is about finding
connections between different things and
forging new connections education
ultimately for me is about giving the
learner confidence and skills to go and
explore the world themselves I believe
there&#39;s power in mystery mystery shocks
the system because mystery shouts out
there&#39;s more here than you think I love
this quote from Dennis Covington Dennis
said mystery is not the absence of
meaning it&#39;s the presence of more
meaning than we can comprehend and
there&#39;s power in wonder in a serious
play because wonder beckons us all in a
net whispers the question I wonder what
if and as power in magic because magic
says let&#39;s throw out the rule books the
limits have changed as a magician I
juggle with reality I dance with the
impossible I push back
boundaries I open up new friends here&#39;s
why because I want to lift my audiences
dreams and imaginations to a new plane
and the reason magicians keep secrets is
not because we&#39;re selfish but because we
know the explanation robs them of that
experience brings them back down to
earth with a bump
so you&#39;d be wrong of me to not show you
a magic trick so we&#39;re going to
hopefully catch this on camera over here
with Lois and we&#39;ve got here we&#39;ve got a
red ship I&#39;m a blue chip so that&#39;s a red
chip and a blue chip or is it a blue
chip and a red chip now my background is
atomic physics thank you my backgrounds
atomic physics atomic physics is this
mind-bending concept that says at a
scale smaller than atoms the worlds not
as we think it&#39;s not clockwork it&#39;s not
predictable
it&#39;s all about probability is all about
possibility it&#39;s all about simultaneous
answers you see a particle could be here
and here at the same time and the weird
thing is when we make an observation it
forces the universe into making a choice
to one particular spot the world&#39;s
returns to being clockwork and
predictable so for me magic is about
creating this quantum state this state
of knowing and not knowing it&#39;s placing
you in front of something that should be
impossible and yet it&#39;s true and if
that&#39;s true what else is true magic
opens up the world it opens up doors I
love the quote from Alice Through the
Looking Glass when the White Queen said
to Alice sometimes I try to believe six
impossible things before breakfast now I
would like to add to that diet that we
should try and wrestle with six
mysteries before lunch because when we
become comfortable with mysteries the
unknown the unknowable we become more
resilient we become more open to new
ideas new possibilities new perspectives
so I&#39;d like to encourage us all to spend
more time between the Wow and the how
the state of knowing
and not knowing because I want that for
my daughter I want her not to be too
quick to jump to assumptions
I want that for all of us and I don&#39;t
want you to lose that so I thought what
we do would create a quantum state in
this room and I&#39;m gonna split the room
so we&#39;ve got the stalls at the bottom
and we&#39;ve got the circle that&#39;s hot now
in a moment I&#39;m gonna ask the whole of
the stools to close her eyes heads down
literally for a few seconds and the
circle just have to remember what they
see on the screen and then we&#39;re going
to swap round so here we go
circle eyes closed heads down two
seconds for the circle start now okay
times up you can look up stools circle
look down here&#39;s your two seconds stools
okay and everyone look up so here&#39;s the
question can you remember what shape was
in the middle what do we see down here
13 and what did you see at the top so
you gave me a way piece or B in fact to
cheer cuz you can&#39;t see the top give me
cheer and a cheer who saw their team yes
that&#39;s what you saw so thank you for
your attention have a wonderful
wonderful day Cheers
[Applause]
