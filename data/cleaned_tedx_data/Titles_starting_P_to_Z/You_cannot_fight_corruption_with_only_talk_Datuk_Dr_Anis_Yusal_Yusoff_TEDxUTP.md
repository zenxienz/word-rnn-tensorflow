you probably be wondering what this
table is going to be about one size fits
all one size doesn&#39;t fit all it&#39;s what I
want to be talking about I&#39;m a
storyteller
is the other thing the fun thing that he
didn&#39;t tell them so this afternoon I&#39;ll
be telling you three stories the first
story is about her story for all the men
out there you must know you always start
with her story before you talk about
history yesterday and finally we&#39;re
going to be talking about our story now
what is this her story all about I want
to begin about this lady that I think is
important for all of us to know is the
issue of corruption I wrote this book a
couple of years ago entitled combating
corruption understanding the many
anti-corruption initiatives in Malaysia
and in that book one of the important
thing that we try to understand is that
corruption is not a new phenomenon
it has been there for a long time in
fact catelleya in his book atashi astre
when he wrote this 2,400 years ago he
already talked about corruption he even
made a comparison that how public
servant in doing their daily life would
be affected somehow or other and be
corrupted in some way or another just as
fish in water you don&#39;t know when the
fish bring the water but when he&#39;s in
the water it might the tendency of
getting drinking and doing other things
so how do we then fight this corruption
issue
we just asked everybody to just stand up
and pitch and promise they&#39;re not gonna
be Corral even husband who make wedding
vows cheated on their wife my wife is
here so I&#39;m sure she knows that I have
integrity now let&#39;s look at the state of
corruption in the world you will see
this is based on the study done by
Transparency International on corruption
perception index and those countries
lighter in color are than less of the
least corrupt countries compared to
those the darker ones now it looks like
almost every part of the world is
corrupt and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here to talk
to you that we together need to do
something about it
but before we talk more detail about the
kind of programs that kind of things the
kind of solution that we can do we need
to understand the cost of corruption the
impact of corruption and what this will
do to a nation if we do nothing to give
you an example to illustrate let me use
an example from Malaysia a couple of
years ago and this is based on a report
by to stand on line in 20 in 2011 when a
group of people from anti-corruption
Commission arrested a number of senior
officials in a custom department and
they estimated that hundred and eight
billion income of this country basically
lost the country losses hundred eight
billion how can the money get lost
because the people we have no integrity
people who are not honest instead of
doing their job to collect money but to
collect taxes instead they take money
for their personal gain
and let whatever taxable product item
get passed through and therefore the
country lost that potential income now
how much is 1 billion how many of you
know how many how many millions are they
in 1 billion thousand thousand million
is a lot of money who can do a lot of
things to illustrate that again that is
look at this report it cost to build a
hospital a state-of-the-art hospital you
need to have at least 110 million now
all of you smart people here please tell
me how many hospitals we could not build
because of corruption now this is real
this is just hospitals we haven&#39;t looked
at other things like it worse these
schools with good facilities roads
bridges and even homes for shelter for
for the four people out there now let us
pause for a minute and look at in real
life why do this thing happen do do
people don&#39;t have any values do people
only know certain things where the gain
and everybody wants to become rich just
because they look at through some role
models who own big house big cars and
you think by being rich is successful we
have to ask ourself and this part of
this talk that I want to share my
personal experience I was never called
by my parents to sit before them and
lecture me I was never lecture but I
learned by observing I learned by seeing
how they act and what do they do
one action that I learned very early age
you know my household my dad introduced
the no gift policy long time before any
government agency stopped people from
receiving gifts
he was just a chief health inspector in
a Municipal Council in Penang and of
course that position is very powerful he
can close down business premises
restaurants if they don&#39;t adhere to the
rules and regulation so people won&#39;t be
nice to him every festive season and
unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of festive
every higher iiv Deepavali every
Christmas every Chinese New Year we will
get hampers and my sister and I of
course you know when we look at nice
chocolates nice gifts but that will come
out and tell us what&#39;s that who&#39;s that
from return it back return to sender
uncle here take this back let&#39;s say we
cannot take this yes he said that for as
long he&#39;s in service he&#39;s not gonna take
any money let&#39;s wait and see if people
do come and give once he&#39;s retired but
who will give gifts when he&#39;s no longer
in power but because he was honest
people do come and give gifts and
another lesson that I learned very early
in age my dad taught us that whatever we
get from people any services we have to
pay for it I remember I remember I did
well in school he took the whole family
out on nothing we went for dinner and on
the way home he remember say he
forgotten to pay one of the stalls maybe
40 cent at that time but he dropped us
home and drove all the way back to pay
that what he said
now when you learn this kind of lesson
if parents are too busy outsourcing
their kids to me to take care and
instead because they say they have to
work to bring back money and the main
one share the kind of values if at all
they have this is important lesson that
you don&#39;t learn in school you don&#39;t
learn in universities and this is why
I&#39;m on a mission to try to remind people
that we have to begin by teaching our
children we have to begin to promote
integrity to inculcate the good values
at home and we have to begin by sharing
this real kind story and while telling
stories we have to do other things as
well sadly why this is an important
because recently we conducted a self
to show the current train of what do the
young people think and this study was
done in a three public universities and
we found that 36% of them says that
accepting gifts in the form of money
goods or services for services rendered
is not wrong the question asks are the
following statements an egg of
corruption and there you have it 36% of
people educated people University
thought that is not wrong 20% said using
funds money for personal interest is not
wrong another 14% says forcefully
obtaining money goods or services from
clients it&#39;s not wrong and I don&#39;t
understand this 21 percent that says
they don&#39;t know that directly involved
in process of awarding contracts to
family members is ok what is happening
to our society you want to get for the
findings about the research let&#39;s look
for the another 20% directly involved in
the process of pointing family members
is ok to a point of family members and
that worrying trend is the 37% they say
submitting claims for our station
accommodation when accommodation was
already provided it&#39;s ok
and you look at the 22% that says they
don&#39;t know that that&#39;s wrong now do we
just allow this kind of trend continue
oh we have to come up with some solution
of what we need to do with it
fortunately 97% says money politics is
wrong but that&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t
involve them it&#39;s the politician but if
it&#39;s involved them is alright for me to
take that the thumb drives even somebody
who said that yeah taking or using
office equipment thumb drive printer
toner for personal uses alright so
people out there please I think this is
important for us to refresh our memory
and try to understand and we
to understand the importance of
integrity in society and why all this
thing must before otherwise it becomes
part and parcel of life you think it&#39;s
all right
and then we we really have problem now
the final part of my talk I want to
share some solution that we have done
and occasionally on it&#39;s not enough we
cannot teach subjects like integrity
integrity cannot be taught formally it
has to be caught and that&#39;s hence the
expedient the background that I gave but
we have to start them young we have to
start them and in kindergarten we have
to share let them understand the values
let them do let them experience it and
we have to continue to do this every
teacher and every subject must at the
end of the lesson add that special
message a teacher who teaches accounting
at the end of class ok kids and now I
taught you how to balance your account
but don&#39;t use this knowledge to evade
from paying income tax to do creative
accounting that&#39;s wrong Society for me
has forgotten do you know when God
created baby in the mother&#39;s womb what
was the first thing that was created the
heart the brain come much later but as
the baby comes out funnily that we just
focus on the brain you want your kids to
be smart you want your kids to get more
education tution piano everything but
who touches the heart no one so as the
kids grow of course they become very
intelligent but they&#39;re very smart of
how to outsmart other people they&#39;re
very smart about how to cheat other
people the brain gets bigger the heart
gets smaller and they become hot less
people and hence they will do the kind
of things that you really newspapers
today we have to reverse all this we
must use technology and in my personal
experience we have developed a dashboard
to monitor the programs initiative
whether they are targeting getting the
right people and from this particular
data that I can share with you from June
20 2015 2 June 2016 we found out that
there
1784 programs initiatives have been
organized throughout the country but
unfortunately from their 1784 we found
1736 our only trauma our only talk shop
now if talk can solve problems all
Muslim and egg goes to Friday prayers
and Christina goes to church to listen
to the sermon would be good people
unfortunately tolerance of problem we
mean other mechanism we need other
initiatives and therefore through
technology you can dissect the data you
can analyze you can do the trend Isis
you can understand the root cause of the
problem we need to use other medium the
social media certainly the young people
are always with a smartphone and we need
to make sure that the social media are
used widely for the for the benefit for
the good things not for the wrong reason
theater movie is one way of you know you
are vulnerable while watching movie in
fact this deem like they were you
listening to me at the European
attention and a lot of multinational
companies are using marketing strategy
product placement in movie without
really realizing there&#39;s a certain car
they want you to drive a certain kind of
cigarettes they want you to smoke and
these are the kind of ways that we have
to use the same method of how we educate
the people how we create awareness to
the people and we are using theater as a
method through arts through photography
competition different competition can
help us to understand from a different
lens of how people look at things and we
need to really use different effort and
different initiatives we have simple
ways of how to attract the youngsters we
created mascots that turtle is a mascot
to reach out to the kids because we have
special program for the kids a special
module for kindergarten and to educate
and relate that this particular mascot
is a mascot that promotes integrity
environment must
we&#39;ll be address people to respect the
environment today people goes to picnic
they can throw all sort of things
without any respect for the other people
to come we have to put signage we have
to remind people they have to practice
integrity family outings a lot of
promotion that family must come together
in terms of fighting this scourge if we
want to have a better future where
corruption doesn&#39;t exist that we have to
start a movement where family the
community must stand together to improve
this finally there are other instruments
out there available one of it is
psychometric tests psychometric tests is
a way that you can psychologically
evaluate whether a person is prone to do
corruption or do anything any wrongdoing
now all this technology is useful in
tech the assessment tools is another way
of how you can make sure that you know
the direction of the organization it can
be assessed and all that is important
for you to then use the community as a
way to get the third eye the additional
eyes and ears to make sure that the
other parties are not going to come in
and destroy the development of the
country now ladies and gentlemen all
these initiatives are just some example
there are many more out there and what I
want to emphasize that we have to employ
and strategize and use whatever
knowledge that we have to fight this
this corruption will destroy us destroy
the future of any nation if we don&#39;t
stand up and start to play our own rule
I begin by sharing that one size doesn&#39;t
fit all and certainly we need different
size of shoes we need all of you to come
together and that&#39;s the only way that we
can fight this problem that has been
around for a long time but we have to
put a stop with that I thank you
you
