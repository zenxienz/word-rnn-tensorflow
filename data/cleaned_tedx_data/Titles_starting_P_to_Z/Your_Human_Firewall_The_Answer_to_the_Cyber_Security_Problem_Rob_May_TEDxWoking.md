according to social media every one of
us has a porn star name if you don&#39;t
know what yours is you need to take your
the name of your first pet and the name
of the road that you lived in when you
were a child just take a moment turn to
the person next to you and introduce
your porn star self
okay
it&#39;s it&#39;s abusing isn&#39;t it
can you back can I have your attention
back please so I&#39;m smokey pound as you
could see it&#39;s amusing and this is why
when you see this on Facebook or
whatever so many people engage with it
there&#39;s lots of different variants there
was one during the elections it was find
out what your toe MP name is and they
use variants like what&#39;s your mother&#39;s
maiden name what school did you go to
and the thing is what I&#39;ve just asked
you to do is turn to a stranger and
share with them information that you
will use for your password retrieval for
things like your online banking and
we&#39;re being tricked like this all the
time and I want to talk to you about
that this morning 18 months ago I was
with Microsoft in reading and they had a
speaker there from the FBI and he came
out and he said there are two types of
organization those that have suffered a
cyber attack and those that will and
then in the summer I was in Canada with
Microsoft and the same guy from the FBI
came out onto the stage and he started
his talk and he said there were two
types of organization and I thought I&#39;ve
come all this way to hear the same talk
but this time what he said was there are
two types of organization those that
have suffered a cyber attack and those
that don&#39;t know they have and this
changes things because we used to think
that when a cyber attack happened it was
on the day that you felt the pain but
now what we understand is that these
criminals are infiltrating our lives our
workplaces our home and our use of
computers
to learn about you and to profile you
and learn who you communicate with and
who you bank with to be clear cybercrime
means any criminal activity relating to
or using computers and every three
seconds somebody suffers for my density
theft online because of cyber crime it
used to be that the biggest criminal
activity in the world was the drug trade
that&#39;s not the case any longer it&#39;s now
cyber crime as you can see from the
chart behind me this year it will cost
four trillion dollars and the cost of
cybercrime is rising by trillion dollars
a year it&#39;s a huge problem and it
affects every single one of us lots of
people invest in traditional security in
a hardware firewall in software
protection in email filtering and so on
but our biggest risk and also our
biggest line of defense are actually
people and it&#39;s what we call the human
firewall and I want to make you think
about the human firewall this morning I
wonder how much you value your security
every year at Olympia there&#39;s an event
called InfoSec where all information
security experts from across Europe come
together for two days for someone like
me that&#39;s great fun last year whilst
that was running they did a survey at
Liverpool Street Station
and they did it in the morning and they
did it in the evening and they were
stopping commuters and the survey asked
three questions and the three questions
were what&#39;s your name what company do
you work for
and what&#39;s your network password
thirty-four percent of people stopped
filled out the form scary isn&#39;t it but
it gets worse
because those people who said no on your
bike as you would hope everybody would
these guys doing the survey was
surrounded by boxes of Mars bars so
anyone that said no they said what if I
give you a Mars bar
70% of people stopped filled out the
form now
the cynic in me thinks that some of
those people will have lied they will
have just filled out the form in order
to get a Mars bar but some of those
people will have given factual
information and with cybersecurity it&#39;s
a numbers game and actually they only
need some of that information to be true
so that&#39;s that&#39;s a case of people
willingly giving that information away
one of the issues is that every day you
are unwittingly giving information away
there&#39;s an organization called identity
Ford dot uk&#39; and what I&#39;m about to show
you is a stunt that they did about two
years ago to inform the public and what
you&#39;re about to see is somebody stood
outside a coffee shop and they&#39;re
encouraging people to like the coffee
shop on their Facebook app and in return
for liking the coffee shop you get a
free coffee and a free pastry now parked
outside the coffee shop is a van with
two people in it with laptops connected
to the web
and what you&#39;re going to see in the time
that it takes to deliver a coffee just
how much information can be found out
about you
purely by you going on to Facebook and
liking a page so take a look at this if
you like our Facebook page we give you a
free hot dream damien26 where do you see
a marked women&#39;s college it&#39;s a
psychologist the Great Ormond Street
oh yeah we know everything about you
Martin thank you
nice to meet you Anna from Russia
frightening stuff isn&#39;t it when I look
at any organization and I consider their
security I visualize it as a pipe and
the pipes got lots of junctions and lots
of joints and every one of those is a
person and when we&#39;re considering our
human firewall the question is does the
person who&#39;s at that joint know how to
protect the pipe and know how to stop
that security breach happening and I
think one thing that&#39;s worth mentioning
is that&#39;s not the job of one person one
person cannot maintain that pipe it has
to be everybody&#39;s responsibility and
everybody needs to be aware of it we
also need to make sure that we&#39;re openly
talking about the latest scams I&#39;m
hearing about them all day every day but
but people seem to be constantly
surprised when I point them out what if
the scams is the it&#39;s called in the
industry the Starbucks scam it&#39;s not
specific to Starbucks and other coffee
shops are also available but the way
this works is you walk into a coffee
shop and you take out your mobile device
and you look for a Wi-Fi point and at
the top of the list is a Wi-Fi point
called Starbucks free Wi-Fi and you
connect to it the thing is Starbucks
don&#39;t call their Wi-Fi Starbucks free
Wi-Fi and what you&#39;ve actually connected
to is a criminal who sat in the corner
of the coffee shop with his laptop
broadcasting an Access Point
and what he&#39;s then doing is he&#39;s taking
information from your device he&#39;s taking
your passwords and so on so you need to
be aware of what we&#39;re connecting to I
love Africa and I&#39;m sure like me you two
have a long-lost relative who lives
there who&#39;s trying to get money out of
out of their accountant into yours
this type of cyber scam is known as
phishing and whilst that particular one
has been around now for nearly 10 years
every month people still fall for it but
fishing has evolved and we&#39;ve now got
what we call wailing so whaling is a
phishing attack aimed at the big fish in
an organization and the way this
typically plays out is an email comes
supposedly from the MD or the CEO to the
Accounts Department giving an
instruction to transfer money from one
account to another by the time I
finished my talk three businesses in the
UK will have suffered from a whaling
attack and one of the problems is that
when you talk to people where this
happens the culture in the organization
is but it was the MD who told me to do
it and it&#39;s more than my Jobs worth to
not do what the MD says but actually
we&#39;ve got to change the conversation and
we&#39;ve got to change the culture because
it should be the case that it&#39;s more
than their jobs worth to transfer that
money without actually having a phone
call to say do you really want me to do
this
one in five businesses in the UK carry
out any form of cyber instruction and
many that do when you talk to them say
what we have a policy and we take it&#39;s
in our it&#39;s in our employee handbook and
we take people through it on their
induction an intelligent person needs to
hear something six times before they get
it and not everyone you work with is
intelligent Galileo said you can&#39;t learn
anything that you don&#39;t know Harvard did
a study that said when a business person
wants to convey a message
they put 85% of their effort into
written word into policies the same
study showed that on average three out
of a hundred people received that
message so having a policy about cyber
isn&#39;t good enough and unfortunately one
of the big things is we have to trust
less we have to talk to our colleagues
we need to educate our children and
teach them to be skeptical teach them
not to be so trusting and if you get an
email or a phone call and the alarm
bells start ringing and it feels just
too good to be true then as with so many
things in life it probably is
there is hope and I want to leave you
with that hope today what we need to do
is we need to embrace the fact that
cybersecurity is not an IT problem this
is something that affects every single
one of us and in an organization it
needs to start at the very top of the
organization and work its way down every
single level we need to embrace training
and education at every level for every
person in the organization for every
student in school at every level and we
all need to be taking part in that
ongoing learning and it needs to be an
ongoing thing it&#39;s not a one-off case I
guarantee you I could come here and
speak again next week and talk about
whole load of new scams that don&#39;t exist
today so that training needs to be
regular and what we need to do is we
need to build our human firewalls we
need to build them high build them
strong and stay safe thank you very much
