hola me llamo Maria Giannini is soy like
Yahud a wound in the granted el salvador
oil is forever la da la importancia they
said billing way hello my name is maria
Giannini and i am the daughter of an
immigrant from el salvador and today i&#39;m
going to talk to you about the
importance of being bilingual language
is the road map of a culture it tells
you where people come from and where
they are they&#39;re going for me as a being
a daughter from an immigrant from el
salvador my mother came here in 1916 the
60s she met my american-born father and
they got married in 1966 my siblings and
i grew up in what I consider to be a
very normal immigrant family at the time
my mother only spoke Spanish and my
father only spoke English
I grew up understanding both languages
but English was my dominant language
that all changed when the civil war in
El Salvador broke out miss Abuelo&#39;s came
my grandparents from El Salvador came to
live with us I was about 7 years old and
I was forced to speak Spanish because
they only spoke Spanish it was a window
into their culture and into their world
growing up in a bilingual household I
knew that it was a gift to have two
languages we honored and loved
travelling the world I remember as a
small child
visiting El Salvador all of the Central
American countries South America and
Europe and I vividly remember when I was
10 years old going to Italy and I
befriended we were on some cruise and I
befriended a young girl who was from
Italy and she only spoke Italian so I
spoke to her in Spanish we figured out a
way to communicate it was remarkable it
actually was a very beautiful experience
for me and looking back today I
recognized that that was one of those
markers in life that you hold with you
it was that moment when I recognized the
gift that I had in being bilingual so
fast forward to my career I&#39;ve been very
fortunate for the past 20 years I have
been
doing what I love I&#39;ve produced events
all over the world I&#39;ve worked for
companies like YouTube Google Pixar
films let&#39;s see the NBA Clinton Global
Initiative Foundation as well as the
National Football League I have visited
over 30 countries doing events and I
have to say that I think that speaking
Spanish has opened that opportunity for
me it&#39;s the single most important skill
that I possess and although many of the
countries that I worked in were not
Spanish speaking countries I know that
it&#39;s my ability to understand other
cultures through my language that has
afforded me those incredible
opportunities so when I started having
kids my husband and I knew that we
wanted to share that gift of
bilingualism with our children but being
an English dominant myself and my
husband even though he&#39;s a
fourth-generation farmer and has to use
Spanish every day he does struggle with
his Spanish and I have to say it&#39;s very
much Oakland Chettle Spanish that he
speaks god bless him we knew that it was
going to be a challenge for us to try to
speak both languages at home so when my
oldest daughter was 3 years old we set
out on doing some research there had to
be in Monterey County as diverse as we
are and statistically and Salinas where
I live
70% of children come from
spanish-speaking household there had to
be bilingual programs multilingual
programs I mean we live in a very
diverse community shockingly I found out
that there weren&#39;t those kind of
programs that my friends studied at
those American French American schools
or Spanish American schools that you
hear about in other countries they
didn&#39;t exist here in Monterrey what I
did find out that there were some
bilingual schools that were actually
teaching English what they were doing is
they were teaching Spanish as a crutch
in order to get to English fluency in
1997 California is voted for prop 2 - 7
which essentially eradicated bilingual
education and what that did is it forced
me
Spanish speakers and all other native
speakers to be forced to learn English
in an English classroom I was shocked I
couldn&#39;t believe it that&#39;s obviously not
what I wanted for my children
or for the children of our community so
I delved into the research and what we
found were there were three schools in
Monterey County that were offering these
small little niche programs they&#39;re
called dual immersion education I had
never heard of Dual Immersion I didn&#39;t
know what it was but essentially through
the research that I found out that it
takes a native English speaker and a
native target language speakers so let&#39;s
say Spanish puts them together for four
full day of school with the goal of high
academic achievement second language
acquisition and obviously the benefits
of learning both languages I was shocked
that that existed I was you know excited
I went to these schools to check it out
to see what they offered and how my
daughter could possibly get enrolled in
it and I was sad to find out that there
were so few kids that were actually
enrolled in these programs and like I
said there were only three of them I did
some more research and found out that
these programs actually closed the
achievement gap between non-native
English speakers and English speakers
and it was shocking to me if this is
where the case why weren&#39;t more people
doing this why aren&#39;t there more parents
advocating for bilingual programs
multilingual programs for their children
so I made it a mission I made it a
mission to educate my friends the
educators in my community about the
benefits of Dual Immersion and I got
together with a bunch of friends and we
now have a nonprofit that we call dual
language program advocates and what we
did is set out to like I said educate as
many people as possible to expand these
programs and give more kids
opportunities in 2011 my daughter my
oldest daughter had just completed or
was completing her kindergarten year at
a Dual Immersion program in Marina at
Marshall West elementary school she was
doing extremely well academically
reading
above grade level in both Spanish and
English and I actually have a little
clip of her in kindergarten I&#39;m going to
show you here really quick hi I&#39;m six
years old and I&#39;m and this is a Spanish
book and I&#39;m in Spanish and by yegor an
English and Spanish and this is
Murcielago ekata el gato trinka atiba
esta aya are diba are you daddy&#39;s o el
gato
aqui na na I right yeah your day are you
delay they Oh Elka Murcielago your de
ayudar a cut-off
so while she was in kindergarten I
recognized the incredible benefits that
she was gaining from being in this
program and like I said I was shocked
that not more people knew about this so
you know I could sit here and list a
bunch of benefits I think we could all
agree learning it earlier is probably
better
how many of us tried to learn another
language when we were in junior high or
high school and how many of you in this
room who are in high school are trying
to learn another language and
recognizing how difficult that actually
is but some of the benefits that we all
know probably recognizes the your
ability to speak to thousands of more
people your ability to communicate
across cultural barriers when you speak
someone else&#39;s language then there&#39;s
also job opportunities obviously those
come with economic benefits there are
cognitive benefits as well and your the
studies and research have shown that
your brain actually gets rewired when
you learn a language at a very early age
and I have some statistics here or
actually have some some of the cognitive
benefits that children acquire when they
learn a language at an early age but one
of the most shocking that I learned
during my research was that it actually
being bilingual and multilingual staves
off dementia and Alzheimer&#39;s that to me
was super surprising but obviously a
huge benefit to learning multiple
languages the other thing that I believe
that gets overlooked the most when we
talk about knowing two or more languages
is your cultural competency and for me
that&#39;s the most important thing as I
said my mother&#39;s from El Salvador
however it doesn&#39;t LIF limit me to just
understand the culture of the country of
where my mom comes from being able to
speak Spanish there are hundreds of
countries that actually speak Spanish so
for me it has opened the doors to all of
those countries as well as many many
others so when I started having kids and
my husband and I decided that we wanted
to put our children in some sort of
bilingual program and we discovered the
benefits
of Dual Immersion I knew that it was my
duty to do above and beyond what I
possibly could do for my community
because this benefit shouldn&#39;t be
limited to a few in 2004 the state of
California only had approximately 200
Dual Immersion programs that it was
really difficult to even find at the
time there was very limited information
about those programs and what they even
even meant so I got together with a
bunch of friends and we met with as I
mentioned that we created the Dual
Language Program advocates and we met
with the superintendent of Salinas City
Elementary School District at the time
the late dr. Donna Alonso Vaughn and she
had always wanted to start a full Dual
Immersion school of Spanish and English
but she had a hard time getting the
english-speaking community to buy into
it so that year when my daughter was
just finishing the kindergarten at
Marshall we set out to start a new
program in Salinas City at Lincoln
Elementary School we recruited 120
families mainly english-speaking
families to buy into this Dual Immersion
program and in the fall of 2011 we had a
full preschool Spanish immersion program
to kindergarten classes and to first
grade classes and just now in 2006 16 my
oldest daughter promoted out of Lincoln
Elementary School she&#39;s now in the
seventh grade and she received the
California syllabi literacy pathway
award it has been a huge tremendous
honor for me to see my children and our
community grow this program as well as
the hundreds of children that it&#39;s
affecting as I mentioned earlier there
were only three small programs that were
around when my daughter started today
there are two full immersion programs in
Monterey County and Lincoln is on the
path to becoming a full immersion
program in three years when we started
in 2008 there were less than 300
students being educated in the Dual
Immersion Pro
now there are 1,600 in Monterey County
that are being educated into immersion
so I thank you I&#39;m super proud of that
but most importantly for me it&#39;s like I
said earlier it&#39;s really about making a
cultural difference and understanding
people because I think it&#39;s our
obligation as parents to raise good
human beings that are empathetic that
are compassionate and understand other
people and for our family language has
been that vehicle and as a proud mom I
do have to show you one more clip of my
daughter who just recently promoted out
of sixth grade here she is and where she
is with her Spanish today Alami nombre
is a bikini knee angle a is Estonian
septum or Grado yo study espanol en la
escuela Lincoln garrison escuela lingua
mi hermana tiene Diez años y tambien
estudia and nice koala as you can tell
she got all her teeth back I just want
to leave you with this I think that it&#39;s
extremely important as I said before
that we all understand one another and
as the former Secretary of Education
Richard Riley said our nation could only
grow stronger if our children grow up
learning two languages our global
economy demands it and our children
deserve it
