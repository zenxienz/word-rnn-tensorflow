at the heart of all living beings
there&#39;s the concept of survival the need
to stay alive and reproduce in times
past the need to ensure survival was an
all encompassing nearly corrupting
sensation a wish to keep the self alive
a wish for life
but it is never that easy famine natural
disasters even other members of your own
species presented a threat each and
every day food scarce water even more so
shelter vulnerable in a world of such
great danger it&#39;s no wonder we and other
animals were so focused on survival well
what about the present according to ham
official a member of the foundation for
nature and culture heritage research
humans millions of years ago did not
have welfare states nor social security
systems that shielded them from the laws
of natural selection we do now over the
past five millennia since the advent of
Agriculture we a tentative state known
as the age of Plenty at least in many
places no longer is our primary concern
survival but success the admiration of
our peers the gathering of currency
increasing our own personal power and
influence all of this because we don&#39;t
have to worry about dying anymore but at
what cost
social hierarchies developed people were
separated and we became end social
hierarchies developed people were
separated and we could distinguish those
between the haves and the have-nots thus
we get selfishness selfishness is
defined as being excessively or
exclusively concerned with oneself or
one&#39;s own advantage pleasure or welfare
for us selfishness is a natural part of
life
you make use of it every day for us
selfishness is a natural part of life we
all have goals hopes and dreams and we
want to focus on them when we want to
focus on them and the age of plenty
however what need have we have
selfishness everyone supposedly gets
what they need and sure that we can
focus on making life the best it can be
for both ourselves and everyone else
right wrong selfishness is intertwined
in almost every thought every action
people trampling over others for power
or money manipulating and perhaps even
killing them all to benefit the self
what horrible creatures are we perhaps
we are not as horrible as we seem
moments ago I asked what need have we
have selfishness in the age of funny and
maybe there is not a concrete answer but
there is an origin survival that ladies
and gentlemen is the root of selfishness
the concept of focusing on the self has
been ingrained within us since the dawn
of humanity because of the need to
perpetuate our species other negative
emotions such as spite have also been
found to have benefits spiteful behavior
is defined as sustaining a cost to
confer a cost upon another
according to rorish me and Patrick
former from the evolution Journal
spiteful behavior contributes to the
stability of a population by limiting
its growth it&#39;s because when a
population remains at a static level it
is supported by the current amount of
nutrition availability this begs the
question however of why these concepts
of selfishness and spite have remained
within us in the age of funny if they
are not required
the answer lies yet again in survival
and natural selection a selection
pressure is an agent of mortality or
fertility that drives a change than a
population today&#39;s selection pressures
have most definitely changed since
prehistoric times but they have and
always will be driving our change and
herein lies the problem we don&#39;t exactly
know what selection
pressures are driving our change in this
day and age personality traits like
Machiavellianism and narcissism had been
shown to garner more success in the
acquisition of careers wealth or power
but is the need or the want to become
wealthy or powerful truly the strongest
force of change in conjunction with
certain physical traits the answer is
yes taller smarter more confident people
are more likely to find the reproductive
partner because not only do they have
the longest straw from the height bucket
but they also had the tenacity in the
willpower to accomplish their goals
going so far as to step on or
marginalize others this brings me to
altruism altruism is defined as
sustaining a cost to confer a benefit
upon another this is the pinnacle of
selfless action gaining nothing or
perhaps even losing something all to
benefit the self you&#39;d have to be and
crazy you have to be crazy to do that
right why not just be the best you can
be well selfishness has been found in
the animal kingdom outside of humanity
according to the American Naturalist
some plants namely the impatiens
capensis plant have been shown to
sacrifice size or sustain harm all to
benefit this Altis benefit the species
in the surrounding area so which one is
more effective on the one hand you have
narcissism Machiavellianism selfishness
and spite all of these relate to the
benefiting the self at the cost of
others this is how mother nature does it
and we make use of it every day it
promotes the survival of individuals or
small groups and thus the species but
perhaps altruism benefits us more now
than it did millions of years ago
problems facing us today like climate
change overfishing deforestation things
like that our problem is the threat and
the species as a whole and that must be
tackled together altruism is the most in
Gordan thing for us now the benefits of
focusing on the self can no longer be
justified when only we as a species can
save ourselves so ladies and gentlemen
wonderful people who join me here to get
today
embrace your animalistic tendencies and
embrace your selfishness it&#39;s natural
it&#39;s healthy it&#39;s important if you&#39;re
constantly worrying about if Diana&#39;s
drama or tennis club is bringing or down
or if marks job doesn&#39;t allow them to be
a leader you&#39;ll never get to focus on
yourself and your goals why would you be
bothered with it after all it&#39;s it&#39;s
their problem you just focus on the best
you can be but what I ask of you of all
of you today is to set that aside one
day take a cost to confer a benefit take
some time out of your day to volunteer
or help someone else or pitch in because
ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s those people
who will save the world thank you
