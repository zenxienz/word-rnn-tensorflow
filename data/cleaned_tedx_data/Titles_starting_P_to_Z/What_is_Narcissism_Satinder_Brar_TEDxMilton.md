good morning everyone thank you so much
for coming narcissism is a word that&#39;s
become so frequently used that I would
suggest that everybody in this room has
some idea of it when they saw this as a
topic it&#39;s a popular insult used by
everybody average citizens members of
the media celebrities and therapists of
course in Psychological circles it&#39;s
anywhere from being an obnoxious
personality trait to a very serious
mental health disorder where did this
word narcissism come from narcissus was
a Greek hunter and he was known for his
beauty he was very very proud and he
rejected everybody that loved him so
there was a nymph named echo echo was
particularly enamored with narcissus
she had no voice of her own because she
had had a curse placed on her so she
would only repeat what others would say
she would follow narcissus around
admiring him from afar she was very very
much in love with him but what narcissus
did is he rejected her and was very
annoyed with her and one day he said to
her I would rather die than love you
nemesis a Greek goddess noticed this
behavior and found it especially cruel
so she decided to place a curse on him
and the curse that she felt was fitting
for him and his cruelty was that he
would know the pain of unrequited love
so one day narcissus was looking at his
own reflection in the water and fell in
love he didn&#39;t realize that it was him
self so he dove into the water to to be
with that image
and he never surfaced so that is the
origin of the word narcissism what it
means is a fixation with oneself one&#39;s
physical appearance and one&#39;s public
perception now what does the word
narcissism mean like I said it&#39;s become
so widely used everybody has some ideas
around it people are using it to
describe just about it everybody your
neighbor you probably said it about a
friend your past lovers a lot of people
will say that hey the one assumption
that&#39;s common about what is narcissism
is that it is wholly destructive right
people think that the fixation with
oneself self-centeredness
self-importance selfishness and
self-admiration is entirely bad but
what&#39;s happening now and is that there
are many people who are suggesting that
that is wrong that it&#39;s a very common
human personality trait just the desire
to feel special so the research over the
past 25 years has shown that the
participants will report have a more
positive and admiral traits than
negative ones compared to their peers
okay so what that suggests the
conclusion of all that research is that
the desire or the need to feel special
is not reserved for the arrogant jerks
that we know or you know the one
scrambling for all the attention but
that it&#39;s something that we all want and
need so the majority of the research
says that that if you ask people to to
list whether they are better than or
less than their friends and family
people just the average person they will
say they are better that most people see
themselves as exceptional and that&#39;s not
a bad thing
the people who do feel that they are
special are happier there&#39;s more
sociable they&#39;re actually more healthy
they are enjoying life more and what we
call that is the better-than-average
effect ok the opposite is true as well
so the people who do not feel special in
any way have higher rates of anxiety and
depression they also find it hard to
admire the people around them and enjoy
their lives well and their perception is
not wrong actually it is actually more
realistic than the better-than-average
affect people but these people who don&#39;t
feel special they sacrifice their
happiness for that realism so they are
sadder but wiser effect is what we call
that so what that all suggests is
suggest is that we all need to feel a
little special but we need to feel it in
moderation it&#39;s when it&#39;s when that need
to feel special goes over the healthy
range that it becomes dangerous so what
we found is that narcissism actually
exists on a scale of 1 to 10 a 0 to 10
so imagine there&#39;s a scale 0 to 10 where
as you move up the scale your need to
feel special increases and as you need
to feel special increases you also get
into an unhealthy
area of functioning so being at the
lower end of the scale at zero this is
where you have no sense of self you have
no self-importance yourself ad negating
you you never want to feel special at
all and at ten it&#39;s the person who&#39;s
scrambling for all the attention at any
cost okay so we have this scale so what
the spectrum let&#39;s call it so let&#39;s talk
a little bit about the spectrum zero to
ten so zero is going to be the person
who has no sense of self the person who
is always putting themselves down never
once attention is is actually rejects
attention rejects being around people
and these are the people who you you
probably all know somebody like this
these are the people who even in a very
difficult situation imagine a woman
who&#39;s lost her husband in a tragic
accident this is the woman that will say
don&#39;t trouble yourself
don&#39;t please don&#39;t you know you don&#39;t
need to do anything for me so she would
rather be alone than be around
surrounded by loved ones okay because
that just that little bit of feeling
special and wanting some attention makes
her feel very uncomfortable the other
end of the spectrum we have ten these
are the people who are always scrambling
for attention these are the arrogant
loud grandiose people that we all know
in our workplaces or in the neighborhood
or or in the family they are they will
do anything to to me get their needs met
to feel special there&#39;s nothing that
seems unreasonable to them they will
hurt people lie steal cheat to feel
special okay so life at these two ends
is very bleak and it&#39;s
very difficult to actually treat these
people the ones that are at 0 or 10 the
most frequently because they&#39;re so
uncomfortable with the feelings that
come with narcissism so the whole read
the whole need to feel special is
because they&#39;re hiding uncomfortable
feelings that they&#39;re they they just
can&#39;t talk about and those are like fear
sadness shame and loneliness
so to avoid those feelings narcissists
are really hanging on to this idea of
being special and you really you will
rarely get those people into treatment
therapy you you won&#39;t see those so now
we have the scale 0 to 10 you move into
the scale around 1 &amp; 9 okay who are
these people the people that are on this
spectrum at 1 &amp; 9 at 1 it&#39;s gonna be the
person who can tolerate a little bit of
attention maybe on their birthday and
that&#39;s it otherwise very avoidant of it
9 is the person who is still seeking
that attention still very grandiose but
will occasionally feel some discomfort
with it okay now 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 so at 2 &amp;
3 you&#39;re getting the people who are can
kind of dream of having grit be great at
something or can maybe think of
potentially getting some attention
during some special time in their life
at 7 &amp; 8 you know you&#39;re you&#39;re there&#39;s
a little bit more flexibility there at 7
&amp; 8 you&#39;re gonna find the people who
will occasionally say something is their
fault
occasionally step back and let somebody
else be the center of the spotlight they
are the ones who
really we&#39;ll say oh yeah you know
they&#39;re doing a lot of this empty
posturing like oh yeah see my new phone
oh yeah I don&#39;t want to tell everybody
about it right so there&#39;s some of that
acknowledgement that you know I have
this great new big house but like I feel
a little uncomfortable talking about it
so they still want to tell you I feel
special but they do know that it&#39;s it&#39;s
it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the greatest behavior
so in the middle basically four to six
this is where is is the healthy range
okay this is where we can feel special
when it&#39;s appropriate and we can step
back when it&#39;s not so this is you know
if when women have a child or you&#39;ve
you&#39;re ill and you need some special
attention so you&#39;re allowing other
people to give you that attention okay
but if you need to support your partner
who has lost a job or you need to
celebrate your friend doing a TED talk
and you can do that so you can allow
other people to be special okay so
really what the conclusion here is that
narcissism exists on the spectrum we&#39;re
all on it because I know I&#39;ll often all
hear my clients say oh I&#39;m not a
narcissist but so-and-so is right or so
we all have this personality trait it&#39;s
it&#39;s a it&#39;s a healthy personality trait
when we are in that healthy range okay
so what are the different so then
there&#39;s different types of narcissists
there is the the extroverted narcissist
that&#39;s the one we&#39;re all familiar with
right the loud obnoxious one the one
scrambling for the attention the one
posting all the pictures the one who
needs to be the center of attention the
one who needs all the praise right those
are the ones we know then there are
introverted narcissus
the introverted narcissists are the
people who often will look like an echo
s tan echo East is a person who has no
sense of self alright so you will think
that they&#39;re the zero on the scale but
they&#39;re not they still feel very very
special but they are so afraid of
judgement they&#39;re so afraid of shame
that they avoid people okay but they
still feel very special these people can
also be very smug the kind that
nothing&#39;s good for them you know I
didn&#39;t you know I&#39;m gonna leave this
party and it&#39;s not good for me or that
wasn&#39;t good enough for me
but they actually feel this like they
have some special gift that people just
don&#39;t recognize that they are some they
have some hidden talents and everybody
else is below them and nobody could
really understand them okay and then
there are the communal narcissus the
communal narcissists are the ones who
are all about helping and giving they
are very uncomfortable with taking any
attention for the taking
actually not attention they they want
attention but they&#39;re uncomfortable with
accepting help because they want to be
the one who gives they want to give to
charities they want to give their time
they&#39;re the ones that&#39;ll corner you in a
room and be like oh yeah so my friend
and I helped her and I did this and I
did that they&#39;re the ones who are always
helping helping helping and then wanting
to tell people they&#39;re helping because
that&#39;s what makes them feel special that
they are giving and not taking okay so
what you see here is that there are
definitely different ways to express
your need to feel special the
the commonality though is that they are
better than everybody else okay so back
to the spectrum and can we move up and
down the spectrum are we fixated at one
place on the spectrum and the answer is
no that we can actually move up and down
if we are within a healthy range that we
can change ourselves to adjust to the
situation that&#39;s at hand that we don&#39;t
have to always feel special or always be
in the shadows okay how are narcissists
made this is a debate that has gone on
forever
nature versus nurture are we born
narcissists are how does it happen I
think a lot of people who&#39;ve dealt with
narcissists will wonder how how did this
person become like this why are they
like this and the reality of that is
that narcissists are definitely made by
the way they are raised and by the
environment they&#39;re they&#39;re raised in so
we&#39;re obviously none of us are a blank
slate we&#39;re all born with a certain
temperament right we are either
we&#39;re either born introverted born
extroverted right and what happens is
the way we are parented impacts how
we&#39;re gonna grow up to be so what that
means is the core experience of whether
we&#39;re gonna go into an unhealthy or
healthy range of narcissism is all based
on one concept insecure love so as what
that means is that as children we need
to know that no matter what we do we are
going to be loved
no matter what we don&#39;t do we are going
to be loved that we don&#39;t have to
imposture and be grandiose in order to
get the love we need from our parents or
we don&#39;t have to hide in the shadows to
get the love we need from our parents
so children need to grow up knowing that
they are loved and supported by the
people who are raising them in order for
them to be adults who are in the healthy
range of narcissism
okay so then it&#39;s just extreme
narcissism and that&#39;s I think another
entirely different TED talk but just to
talk about it a little bit extreme
narcissists are the people who feel
entitled and are willing to exploit to
get what they want so we call that in
Psychological circles the EE factor
exploitation and entitlement when people
feel that they are special and are
willing to do anything in order to get
what they feel they deserve they&#39;re
willing to lie steal cheat distort ruin
people&#39;s self-esteem ruin people
financially that&#39;s exploitation and
that&#39;s where you get the extreme
narcissists and they will they will hurt
you and they will destroy you and
they&#39;re very very difficult to treat and
my only advice for that is to run do not
stay with them do not think you can fix
them do not think you can change them
they&#39;re very very difficult to change so
it turns out that narcissism is not so
bad after all that the need to feel
special can actually help us enjoy our
lives more it can help us grow to our
higher potential and love our family and
friends even more so go out there feel
special and have a great life with it
thank you
you
