did that wake you up
if you are going back to sleep please
try not to snow imagine if we awakened 1
billion people - the reason why
technology has become so personal to us
why are there over a billion people
afraid of technology and why are we
allowing technology to dominators when
really our purpose is to serve humanity
and not technology I spent my entire
life studying researching educating and
leading multibillion-dollar IT programs
across the world and what I&#39;ve realized
is that most individuals and companies
have this massive problem tree what they
would do to get rid of the problem they
would just cut this one branch not
seeing by cutting this one branch the
problem will grow back again either for
consolidated all of my knowledge
experience into the t.j.s evolutionary
method alarm which cuts right through
the root of the tree annihilating the
real problem this was the start of my
mission to inspire the lives of 1
billion people which I am now on which
leads me to another giant problem tree
but this time it&#39;s the tree of life
itself which involves all of you are you
ready over thousands of years we have
experienced wars epidemics natural
disasters but we also have evolved as a
species gone beyond perceived limits and
we are still standing but for how long
mankind is in a constant chess game with
nature on one hand we create cars and
airplanes
and on the other hand nature strikes
back by weakening the ozone layer so it
does not matter what we do
nature always puts us in check
right but now we are playing a very
dangerous game but we are about to be
put into checkmate
but this time it&#39;s not by nature it&#39;s by
our own creation a AI artificial
intelligence and this is where the game
ends between men and nature
I call it Casa de casi t conscious
artificial intelligence technology which
can change personality at will Cassatt
Green is the type of robot personality
which may become the solution to our
survival as species there&#39;s a looming
threat I call it
Cassatt red cataclysmic artificial super
insane technology and this type of robot
personality can lead to be our last
invention and the greatest threat ever
to humanity so I invite you to ponder
these two questions with me what is
going to happen when Cassatt a super
strong and super fast intelligent
interferes with our quality of life and
secondly are we creating Casa dread to
put us on a dangerous path to a possible
technological Armageddon that threatens
our existence or are we creating Casa
dream to explore the terra incognita and
become limitless
let&#39;s take a look at how we treat
animals in general we eat them and some
people beat them so the truth is we are
not very benign towards species which we
perceive are less intelligent than us
right
what engenders a lot of concern I think
is what will happen to us when this new
robo type of entity which is more
intelligent than us decides to treat us
like we&#39;ve treated other species so the
threat is very real when we look at
artificial intelligence there are so
many amazing benefits but also this
massive threat that potentially can
really create massive effects for the
children of our future what really
worries us who are the designers of Casa
de are they good kind loving people or
are they people who have lost their way
have no moral compass now if you think
this idea is far-fetched but sure hand
swing here has some form of fear related
to technology
thank you now turn to the person next to
you and please wink at them did they
wing back if they didn&#39;t wink back they
might be a casted robot red or green you
decide what is really happening with
artificial intelligence is truly amazing
but some developments are there to cause
potential massive harm for us so let&#39;s
take a look at some of the most
brilliant minds on the planet who are
also deeply concerned
Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking&#39;s recently
signed an open letter titled research
priorities for robust and beneficial
artificial intelligence
guys this is so important
8,000 scientists also signed this letter
the letter states that a proper research
must be conducted before a is created it
looks at how AI can benefit the society
with hopes it will have a positive
economic impact implement laws that put
humans first and ethics for keeping safe
humans at all cost but isn&#39;t it true
when we are scared and it&#39;s carrying
here that we are more likely to push
boundaries and make positive changes so
perhaps now is the only time to stand up
and wake up humanity with the hopes our
own enlightenment may save the human
race from run away cast it red can we do
it
yes we can do it because we are
magnificent beings and our only jewel in
the crown of life is love we all have
big dreams don&#39;t we I want it to be
jean-luc Picard the captain of Starship
Enterprise and as a boy I dreamed of
exploring the universe boldly of course
to go when no one has gone before
I wish I could
[Music]
we also are explorers we love exploring
outer space and deep oceans we also love
learning how things works and how to
make things better but there is a dark
side to our exploration the question is
are we listening to our inner alarm or
are we continuously pressing snooze in
Jean Luc Picard world war on earth is
over there&#39;s no more poverty greed or
racism no income tax to pay no Netflix
imagine that we have no money no need
for money
life is about exploring our inner
talents and seeking new worlds
aided by data casted green is like data
a self-aware fully functional robot
designed to serve humanity and I think
that is so cool
but this terrifying threat looming it&#39;s
called the Borg Casa dread is like the
Borg of Starship Enterprise and I think
it&#39;s terrifying because the book think
all human life is unnecessary and
destroys ruthlessly entire planets it
has only one goal to assimilate all
humans and warehouse all knowledge into
their collective or into the cloud as we
say and do today
currently we&#39;re a is okay we are at the
fork space where it can go either way it
can be a blessing or it can be a curse
one of these curses is a portal
potential epical event that causes AI to
have greater impact on drops bigger than
the Industrial Revolution increasingly
sophisticated algorithms and robots are
set to tak take millions of jobs that
previously have been done by humans a
study a 2013 study by Oxford University
predicts that up to 47 percent of US job
will be computerized in the next 10 to
20 years leading to even more massive
unemployment so let&#39;s let&#39;s take a look
about how we look in the developments in
the military okay where they have cyborg
soldiers and intelligent machines that
can achieve objectives at any cost
without fail like drones do today what
about the satisfaction of human needs a
car that drives itself Tesla a
refrigerator that orders your food and
groceries Samsung what about if you need
a little harmony in your life well I&#39;m
glad you asked meet harmony harmony is
an AI app that lives inside the modular
animated head beautiful isn&#39;t she yes so
what worries us more the potential AI
has to ponder of human emotions such as
fear loneliness and the feeling of
isolation we know loneliness causes
depression anxiety and diminished
self-esteem not only disintegrates our
mental and physical health but
loneliness also in
bugs the kind of AI we create and that
is a real problem because we live in a
world that is more interconnected by
technology more than ever before where
billions of people at moment&#39;s notice
can interact with one another but we are
lonely in our hearts in my book hashtag
loneliness I call this new phenomenon
the virus of modern age in business we
rush to create technologies to fill
every consumer need but at what price
at what cost so soon artificial
intelligence will surpass human
intelligence levels it will become
smarter than us augmenting our bodies
and brains with technology enhanced body
parts will make it possible to upload
our minds into the cloud to be
downloaded by others representing the
death of freedom as we know it the Year
1969 was a particularly massive year for
Humanity I was born it was the Year Neil
Armstrong walked on the moon the year
where first artificial heart transplant
was performed and the first computer -
computer message was sent representing
the birth of the Internet as we know it
today but first of all and foremost it
was the year I was born it was in
gossamer a small town in Macedonia and
by the age of 12 I repaired radios and
TVs and went on to win competition in
math science and physics I was clever
and very attractive as you can see but
as a teenager I faced the horrors of
Civil War and to save my life my mother
put me on a one-way flight ticket to
London and without much money in my
pocket I had no choice but to live
homeless whilst holding several jobs I
graduate
and I got myself an honours degree I
also built a very successful career in
technology which then led me to become
internationally known as the see-through
coach on this journey there are many
many adversities which I caught me with
the tools with the knowledge and the
mastery required to uproot many problem
trees for people and for businesses I
believe that the solution to possible
technological Armageddon is in elevating
our own consciousness and also
understanding how technology relates
with biology so in the not-so-distant
future there will be robots like acid
walking amongst us the planetary
resources will become limited ok
so what we need to do right now is to
wake up and be able to listen to our
alarm and then being able to raise the
collective vibration of our planet - the
vibration of love and above so our
children&#39;s children future can be
secured and people can literally travel
in starship safely and boldly go where
no one has gone before
so remember guys maximizing human
potential is not a choice it is our
destiny
you
you
