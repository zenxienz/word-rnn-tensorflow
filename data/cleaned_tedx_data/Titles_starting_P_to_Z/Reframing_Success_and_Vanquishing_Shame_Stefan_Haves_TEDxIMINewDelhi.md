Oh Oh the lights change the little kid

has been here since 10:00 a.m. let&#39;s
give him a hand okay look at that kid
and not only do I have these cameras but
I have a drone up in the air taking my
picture man this is awesome thank you so
much thank you so much for for allowing
me to share some things with you I&#39;m not
here to teach I&#39;m here to learn and I&#39;m
gonna learn from you right now oh you
know I&#39;m reminded right now I want you
to think not I want you to think not I
want you to think not about what I&#39;m
saying
but I want you to think about what I&#39;m
doing - okay there&#39;s a whole other
physical world that is happening right
now we are so used to in TEDx talks for
someone to say I went here ended the
click click click but there is so much
physically going on I want to
communicate to you with my entire body I
don&#39;t want to communicate thoughts I
want to communicate a whole experience
and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do today
we&#39;re also worried about technology and
we&#39;re also worried about robotics and
we&#39;re also worried about them taking our
place and you know something it&#39;s so
funny because I work with clowns they
will never take my place so I can act
like a fool I can act like a fool in
front of you now in your world acting
like a fool is being a failure but I
work with clowns
and so acting like a fool as a clown I
do it on purpose and I love doing it on
purpose and what this talk is all about
is what I like to call reframing success
and vanquishing shame
without running away to the circus we
want to be able to look at success as
sharing ourselves not withholding
ourselves it is so easy for us to be shy
but shy is selfish okay
we all have a once-upon-a-time everybody
can say oh oh come on everybody say oh
oh yeah I know I I had trouble as a kid
I ran away to the circus for a good
reason because I was not a happy camper
as a kid and you know I was adopted and
my father died when I was young and I
there was a my job description in the
family was to keep everybody happy was
to keep everybody laughing and
regardless of how I felt I didn&#39;t want
to show my real feelings I wanted to
just make everybody else happy and then
I went on to school and then my job
there I got promoted to class clown and
I made everybody in school happy too
it was awesome and then I went on to
college and then I went to a clown
school and in that clown school I was
very opinionated as a kid and I thought
I was all that and so I dropped out of
clown school which I&#39;m kind of you know
I&#39;m kind of proud of and um and then I
went to the streets of Paris juggling
and from there I met the best clown in
the world from there I went on to work
with circuses worldwide from there it
was a circus world it was the most
awesome circus world that I could have
ever imagined I could come together with
people and make beautiful things the
thing that&#39;s incredible about the circus
is that you in the audience are
participants you are not spectators I
could come really close to you
you all look up and there&#39;s a high-wire
act where peril meets connection that&#39;s
where we live it&#39;s that moment it&#39;s that
beautiful moment where the high wire guy
is going across and the mother goes over
to the son and holds the hand peril and
connection that&#39;s what I live for
so in terms of anything I do I&#39;m feeling
a pretty good connection with you guys
but I don&#39;t feel there&#39;s enough peril
for you so so that means I&#39;m gonna bring
someone up on stage you and the white
come on up let&#39;s give her a hand come on
up hello what&#39;s your name
Steffi I&#39;m Stefan Stefan Stefan we&#39;re a
comedy team were great that day and
Stefan adovada Wow
she&#39;s beautiful what&#39;s your I want you
to wait three seconds and say your name
ready go good she&#39;s she&#39;s amazing
because she waited three seconds and she
said her name loudly she was
extraordinary because right now she&#39;s
got what I do when I see someone on
stage like this and you did better than
most people I know are you an actress no
are you a performer yes
okay good yes okay she is a performer
awesome she&#39;s a performer she is it and
all she has to do as a performer and I
got to tell you I do this with thousands
of people usually they say their name
right away you waited three seconds said
your first and last name all you have to
do as an actor is follow directions it&#39;s
like Spencer Tracy said I&#39;ll tell you
what acting is remember your lines and
don&#39;t bump into furniture that&#39;s all you
got to do so you&#39;re halfway there okay
there&#39;s something we have and that
something is called the performers
instrument
that&#39;s body voice speech and imagination
okay now there&#39;s the this this is all we
have to do
we&#39;re like if you&#39;re a piano that&#39;s what
your piano is emotions are like the song
body voice speech and imagination is
what you have to perform okay
so right now how are you feeling right
now okay good
she&#39;s feeling confused so that&#39;s the
imagination isn&#39;t really working if I
were to ask you to take two steps take a
drink of water and step back ready go
okay good she just said I don&#39;t have a
glass of water but that was her saying
Oh imagination hasn&#39;t kicked in okay so
it&#39;s amazing how like this moment in
time you going forward why do you go
forward for water are you thirsty
how heavy is the water what does it feel
like on your lips how does it go down
emotions come from senses so I have to
replicate sensory work it&#39;s incredible
okay good now the thing that is
preventing you from being an awesome
actor to begin with his adrenaline now I
am addicted to adrenaline because I&#39;m a
performer okay now what is what what am
i addicted to possible public
humiliation the fact that you people
might not like me the fact that
everybody will throw tomatoes and I&#39;ll
be running out of here okay I but I&#39;m
addicted to that that possible public
humiliation with with the emphasis on
possible and then ultimately surviving
that&#39;s what I need to do now you in
terms of what you if you&#39;re not a
performer I&#39;m going to ask you to be a
participant I&#39;m going to I want you to
prevent adrenaline from hijacking your
expressive freedom
okay she just said okay but did she said
it very softly so I go back to the
instrument and I go oh the voice she
didn&#39;t breathe
she didn&#39;t say okay now it&#39;s like if you
place I see we I got some guys in the
front if you guys play soccer okay
you&#39;re playing soccer and then the ball
goes into the the street you guys would
go hey watch out and you would inhale
before you spoke because that&#39;s what we
do but when people are nervous on stage
they don&#39;t breathe when you don&#39;t
breathe you die so so let&#39;s thank her
for coming up and helping me thank you
all right the the reason we have to be
good with our instrument is we don&#39;t
want to be selfish with our art what
does that mean to be selfish with our
art that means I&#39;m shy shy is selfish
because you are withholding your spirit
your ideas your innovation your
individuality your possible mistakes and
those mistakes please make them please
make mistakes because no one is gonna
hurt you when they say no they&#39;re just
gonna say hey what about this no that&#39;s
all that&#39;s gonna happen so I urge you to
not be selfish with your art and to
change your story remember my sad story
about being adopted and all that I have
to let that go and I have to go how can
I change that and we have that capacity
we do have that capacity in the way okay
summon the courage to edit your life
movie okay close-up on freeing personal
contempt you don&#39;t need to be angry with
yourself you don&#39;t have to be hard on
yourself cutting all scenes with a false
narrative of cruel judgment of
turning the camera towards anyone but
you because if I had the camera on me
right now folks I would be worried about
my wrinkles here my my bald spot here
what the heck is going on they don&#39;t
like me but if I go like this and I put
the lens to you and I want to be
generous oh that&#39;s a better feeling I
want to communicate
I want to engage I want to have a
dialogue okay focus on empathy and
service to others craft a script
promoting community and tolerance and
finally risk a long shot chance and
support fellow risk takers a long shot
chance that&#39;s what you got to give
yourself let me take a risk let me take
a risk why not it really the the
punishment in your brain is so much
worse than the self involved people that
you&#39;re dealing with they&#39;re all thinking
about themselves they&#39;re not thinking
about you failing okay so we try to
release the work of pain and then awaken
the childlike wonder of play I have been
doing this work in China Romania India
USA France Spain Italy all over the
world were all the same we all love to
play and we were all perfect actors we
were all perfect performers we were all
perfect clowns before puberty when we
were seven eight nine years old ten
years old we were we just played with
our friends we played outside we played
in in our rooms we just did that and
then our bodies started changing and
things got more complicated and I&#39;m
sorry about that we spend you know three
four years going through that time of
our lives and then we spend the rest of
our lives healing from it okay I
remember being with some friends and
and I was I was I reached puberty late
so I&#39;m I&#39;m with friends and they&#39;re big
guys and they&#39;re like hey how are ya and
I go hey you guys want to play on the
jungle gym over there and I started to
run to the jungle gym and I look back
and they were laughing at me they were
going yeah go to the jungle gym
yeah and I remember going like turning
around thinking I&#39;m never gonna play
again it&#39;s not safe to play again we all
have that experience globally and we all
have the beauty of bringing imagination
into our life again we got really good
at it at age six seven and eight and now
as adults I welcome you to bring
imagination back into your life it&#39;s
about us a global week it&#39;s magic part
of us being so technologically oh but
consumed is the masculine logic has
taken over our heads are are getting so
big with information and at the same
time our feminine intuition is being
back-burnered now let&#39;s let&#39;s talk a
little bit about what intuition is when
I&#39;m walking down a road and it feels
creepy I feel low that&#39;s not a brain
thing that&#39;s a body thing okay so
intuition we need to be able to balance
the masculine and the feminine in our
lives sweet breath is with inhale and
exhale if I was a TEDTalk ER right now
and I was just like hey okay everybody
I&#39;m gonna be doing this and better da da
da da da da you don&#39;t like me right
there but if I come in and I&#39;m inhaling
and I&#39;m intuitive and I let the feminine
inhale speak I go here
hello I&#39;m here to talk to you about
imagination and I let it in
but our adrenaline forces us to actually
ignore the intuitive well I&#39;m almost at
the end of my talk and it always should
end with love okay
and love I am I have found the person
that I have to fall in love with
unfortunately that person is me I&#39;m
discovering love through humor and
through personal acceptance I just want
to let you know I have to that the bad
news is I&#39;m the problem when it comes to
love and bringing in other people I&#39;m
the problem that&#39;s the bad news the good
news is I&#39;m the problem because I can
fix me
I can change me I can do anything to be
better so when it comes to relationships
one plus one does not equal two it
equals eleven a complete one next to a
complete one
[Music]
[Applause]
now I want you guys to what I want you
guys to follow your bliss manifest and
I&#39;m gonna end with a real treat for you
guys okay so what I&#39;m going to do is I&#39;m
going to share a little thing that is
body body intelligence not mind
intelligence because if I have any kind
of thing to give you it&#39;s stay out of
the logic and into the intuitive so
ladies and gentlemen may I present to
you back man
