few years ago I got to go to my 20-year
high school reunion and it was a wild
experience I mean there were people
there who I&#39;ve been friends with over
the years and so I was just hanging out
there were some folks who I&#39;ve you know
just kept up with on Facebook and watch
their kids grow up and straight up there
were some people who were complete and
total strangers I&#39;ve never seen them
before in my life and we made friends
that weekend and anything from just
hanging out and the events and going out
that whole weekend was a fantastic
experience in the day of the reunion
that there was a party that night and
and I found myself at like 2 o&#39;clock in
the morning in a hotel parking lot a
bunch of other 40 year olds pretending
like we&#39;re 18 drinking rum and coke out
of the trunk of some guy&#39;s car and and
this buddy of mine is telling this story
about how he was like this journalist
and China and getting the scoop and
there was this bar fight and in getting
away and I&#39;m like I&#39;ve got a story to
write and so my story actually took
place just a few days before the reunion
and see I do all the cooking in our
house and in that night it was like
Daddy does not feel like cooking even a
little bit it&#39;s gonna be whatever you
can find in the kitchen that is what&#39;s
for supper and and I was hungry right
then so I went into the pantry and I
found a brand new full unopened box of
cookie krisp and I&#39;m looking at it and
I&#39;m like hey I&#39;m a grown man I can have
a box of cookie crisps for supper I
wouldn&#39;t and so I went I poured myself a
bowl of cookie krisp and I&#39;m eating my
cookie crisp and you know I was reading
the paper or looking at my phone or
something and you know poured myself
another bowl of cookie krisp and
finished that one too in about that time
my youngest daughter who was about eight
years old at the time she comes up and
she&#39;s like ooh daddy can I have cookie
crisps for supper too I&#39;m like yeah baby
get you a bowl come over here hang out
with that now she she got her rolling I
poured her a bowl of cookie krisp and
and I didn&#39;t wanted to be eaten by
yourself there so I poured myself a bowl
too and and I&#39;m eating me a bowl cookie
krisp and you know your friend and she&#39;s
like Daddy can I have another bowl sure
baby here you go you know aboard her
bowling you know poured myself another
bowling
always hanging out and a good time
talking and doing all that and I
realized my bowl is empty you know so I
poured myself another Bowl and and I
looked up and it was funny because I saw
the expression on my daughter&#39;s face
change and she goes daddy how many bowls
of cookie krisp are you gonna have and
it was odd because right at that exact
same moment my wife came walking into
the kitchen and she had the exact same
expression that my daughter on her face
and she says baby how many bowls of
Cookie Crisp has daddy had and I&#39;m like
no no grown man I get to have cookie
crisps for supper if I want you know and
I&#39;m looking at my daughter and and I&#39;m
looking at her and I&#39;m like don&#39;t rat
out daddy don&#39;t do that and I&#39;m looking
at the Cookie Crisp police over here and
again the expression on her face changed
and she says oh mama daddy&#39;s had four
balls and my wife sees president change
and I&#39;m looking down at the little rat
and I&#39;m going man thank God you lost
town cause it ain&#39;t for I&#39;m on five now
baby and and it&#39;s funny because so I&#39;m
telling that at the high school reunion
and everybody&#39;s laughing at two o&#39;clock
in the morning everybody&#39;s laughing it
was it was so funny and so like the next
day I&#39;m at breakfast and there are some
people who weren&#39;t there that night they
come find me and they&#39;re like hey Brian
hey we want to hear the cookie krisp
story and I hate yeah wait wait what oh
no man so I&#39;m not my high school reunion
and all of a sudden I&#39;m like the Cookie
Crisp guy how did that happen right but
people connected to that story and I
wasn&#39;t sure was it was it my the rat
you know was it the Cookie Crisp police
over here was it me or was it just this
you know this love and appreciation for
Cookie Crisp that they shared with me
and and so I started thinking about who
they are that they would connect with me
you know and who I am and and who are
you now someone asks you the question
you know who are you who am I and I my
first response honestly is is probably
my name is hey I&#39;m Brian you know but
then I started thinking you know it kind
of depends upon who&#39;s asking the
question right you know if they have on
a shirt this is Alabama Crimson Tide I&#39;m
like whoo I&#39;m an LSU Tiger you know if
I&#39;m up in New Hampshire being a two
I might say oh I&#39;m a southerner if I&#39;m
overseas I&#39;m America all right or if
there&#39;s a spaceship that lands in little
green men get out I&#39;m probably gonna go
real basic and just say hey I&#39;m a human
being and see all of those words we use
to describe our membership in
communities communities that are larger
than ourselves it might be our school or
our region it might be our country right
but they describe a connection that we
have with others and when we
intentionally enter into those
connections and we value the connections
that we have with others that&#39;s where we
build community where we find unity and
that&#39;s what is going to heal the
divisions that threaten to tear us apart
so here&#39;s what I want you to do I&#39;d like
everyone here I want you to close your
eyes for just one moment close your eyes
and I want you to think about who the
strongest connection you have in your
life I want you to just visualize them
do you see their face or maybe it&#39;s
their eyes or their smile or their laugh
I want you to get a good mental image of
them and now open your eyes okay do you
see them is it is it your son or your
daughter or a brother or a spouse you
know who it&#39;s probably not it&#39;s probably
not one of the ladies who registered you
when you walked into the building today
right so we can agree that there are
some connections that we have that are
stronger than others right but you can
actually be connected to total strangers
see in the mid-1980s our family was
stationed over in Europe my dad was in
the Army for 20 years and and while
we&#39;re over there living in Germany we
went on vacation and we were saying it
was essentially is like a
bed-and-breakfast a German guesthouse
and it had an older German man and his
wife ran it and one evening my dad and I
are there on the first floor in the the
dining area and this old German man is
talking to my dad and he says well where
are you from and my dad says oh well you
know we&#39;re from the United States and he
says ah I know this where the United
States are you from and my dad says oh
well you know in the southern part of
the United States there&#39;s a we&#39;re from
the state of Mississippi and he says I
have been to Mississippi it&#39;s just
really that&#39;s
wild you know kind of a small world
gonna they all where and Mississippi are
you from mine so well you know in the
state of Mississippi right there on the
Mississippi Gulf Coast I&#39;m from this
town called Biloxi and this old German
man says I&#39;ve been to Biloxi and it&#39;s
like okay now this is getting kind of
wild right that is this small world is
getting a lot smaller and of the the
odds of this German man having been
doubt of all the towns and states in the
United States he&#39;s been to Biloxi
Mississippi - as well on earth are you
doing in Biloxi Mississippi and he says
world war two prisoner of war and when
the United States Army would capture
German army soldiers they would ship
them back to the United States and there
were four POWs camps in Southern
Mississippi and this man was one and all
of a sudden there&#39;s a connection but see
we can be connected to people that we&#39;ve
never even met a few months ago Chris
Cornell who was the lead singer to the
band Soundgarden committed suicide and
when the news came out it was like a
punch to the gut and not just me and my
friends I mean we&#39;re all talking about
this impact that this guy had and and
I&#39;m thinking about why am i connected to
this man but through his words and his
music when I was in high school in
college oh I connected to them even
though that connection was entirely
one-sided but does the connection remain
does it just does it just die off so in
May of this year I was actually in this
exact building sitting right about there
and I was sitting next to an old family
friend of ours who happened to be an
Army veteran - and he was telling me the
story of how he and his wife recently
traveled halfway across the country to
go visit an old Vietnam buddy of his and
I&#39;m like wow him listen to this story I
mean this is an older man the trip is it
wasn&#39;t necessarily easy it took them
several days and they left South
Carolina and they drove all the way to
the middle of nowhere Illinois and I&#39;m
talking like Chicago&#39;s up here I&#39;m
talking like cornfield nothing else one
stoplight maybe they&#39;re right and they
didn&#39;t go all the way from South
Carolina to there for these you know two
old guys to trade stories about Nam or
or talk about their kids or show
pictures and talk about the
accomplishments of their grandkids no
see this man and his wife they drove all
the way across the country
in the middle of nowhere Illinois to
stand in a cemetery to stand at the
grave of his Vietnam buddy who died
fifty years ago this year and they did
that because he&#39;s still connected I mean
against logic and space and time
these two men are still connected and
they drove all that way to honor the
connection you remember the term least
common denominator
there&#39;s some serious fourth grade math
for you do you remember what it means so
the least common denominator is when you
have a bunch of different fractions and
you there is one common multiple among
all of them it&#39;s the one number that
they can all be reduced down to see we
have a least common denominator you and
me and the taxi driver in Kazakhstan
great we&#39;re all members of the species
Homo sapiens we&#39;re all humans and and
that ties us together into a community
that&#39;s not defined by our physical
aspects like you got two eyes two ears
and a spleen see we share hopes we
shared dreams and pain and fear and
desire and love we share the unseen see
our least common denominator is the
authentic most inward and hidden parts
of ourselves but see we focus on the
differences on what you can see his skin
color isn&#39;t the same as mine her
language isn&#39;t the same as mine his
sexual orientation it isn&#39;t the same as
mine her politics and ideology they are
not the same as mine his religion isn&#39;t
the same as mine you see that pattern
see we use those differences to turn
human beings into other but see we can
rise above that if we choose to recently
Senator John McCain was diagnosed with
this god-awful form of brain cancer and
see messages of love and hope and
support poured in from both sides of the
aisle from his most bitter
fools September the 11th happens and
there&#39;s Congress on the steps to the
United States Capitol singing not about
divisive &#39;no sand ideology and budget no
they&#39;re singing songs of unity songs of
america they want relationship and they
want authenticity right and if there&#39;s a
terrorist attack or a natural disaster
that happens what happens
social media lights up with messages of
love and hope and support why because
we&#39;ve been there or we could be there we
recognize that that there are ties that
bind us all together like that I think
there is a recent study by the foster
School of Business at the University of
Washington that says that people desire
genuineness they they want that
authenticity when dealing with others
but see we live in this globalizing
world right where billions of people are
now friends or followers and is that how
we value connection the quantity the
sheer number is that what we teach our
children is that what we teach ourselves
that it&#39;s the number of likes and
comments and views that you can get see
our world&#39;s becoming more polarizing not
less people surround themselves in
communities that are insular that
perpetuate their beliefs and we see the
effects of those beliefs and attacks in
places like Syria and Barcelona and
Manchester and in Paris but see not just
there we see that right here at home
in Charlottesville and in Charleston in
Dallas and Baton Rouge and Ferguson in
Orlando see the speeches are not gonna
save us hashtags are not going to end
the divisive naseeb is not gonna
overcome this evil what does that change
look like for you and for me see for me
it starts with ending some racial
stereotypes of me accepting an
invitation to an
all black church they&#39;re going to see a
black barber or firing one contractor
when he uses racial slurs against
another respecting people not based on
result err and etiquette but on their
value as a person another person with
hopes and fears and dreams and desires
just like me so what can you do what
should you do I mean we&#39;re not gonna
walk out of here locked arm-in-arm
singing Kumbaya and some new-age hippy
lovefest that ain&#39;t gonna happen I think
here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to ask and I&#39;m
going to I think we should start small
be good to the cashiers in your life at
the coffee shop and at the auto parts
store at the grocery store at the gas
station see that&#39;s someone&#39;s mom or
their brother or their son or their wife
or their daughter right see them as you
want others to see you as a person
worthy of respect and time and energy
and love actually don&#39;t just be good to
your cashiers be exceptionally good and
see you and me all of us in here all of
us being exceptionally good and kind to
all of the cashiers in our lives that is
what&#39;s going to change the world thank
you very much
[Music]
you
