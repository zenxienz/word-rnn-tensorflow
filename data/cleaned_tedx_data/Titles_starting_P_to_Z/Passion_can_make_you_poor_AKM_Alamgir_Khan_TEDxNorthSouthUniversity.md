hello hi everybody thank you for having
me here I own Yama&#39;s comics and
collectibles and I opened the shop in
2010 when I opened the shop some of my
friends asked me why are you doing this
I mean I said why not have you have you
looked at to yourself your vault
and I said yes and you have a you have a
growing belly what what&#39;s that got to do
with anything
have you seen Simpsons have you seen the
comic book guy yeah so that had
something to do with it anyway
so I opened this story in 2010 because I
was feeling nostalgic I had some excess
cash flying around and my daughter was
starting to I remembered my childhood I
was born in 1974 and I remember my
childhood quite fondly I really
appreciate the modern life and we have
the blessings of the smartphone and the
Smart TV and Facebook community social
media and everything we didn&#39;t have that
we did not have any mobile phones any
cable TV any Internet any PC so it was
kind of boring so you had to talk to
each other to pass time you had to spend
time with your friends go out in the Sun
play read books and read comic books
back in the 80s it was a great time for
Congress you had stuff like you know
Archie comics and children&#39;s comics like
kids comics from Harvey and Gladstone
which published Disney stuff and you had
the superhero stuff and our neighbor
India used to publish have publications
like individual comics which reprinted
Western comics and they had a mochi
through kotha and a magazine called
twinkle later on they also had non
dafonte but through the gray just show
three and everything and it
was a good time what happened
internationally in the comics arena was
following the great success of the 1989
movie Batman there was this huge boom
and after that boom there was a huge
crash during that boom in the West
Western world they sometimes hide their
comic crisis twice sometimes three times
and that hurt the community and that
crash in from the mid 90s still felt in
our country we used to get comics in a
lot of places like in New Market in
Bailey Road in Gulshan and a lot more
places but after that crash after the
mid 90s those who like comic books or
follow comic books did they will realize
that the supply suddenly stopped and
after my first born option was here in
2008 I kind of felt you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
kind of sad it&#39;s kind of sad that my
kids and other kids and people young at
heart like I am and will will have a
less colored less colorful world because
comics adds color it&#39;s it it&#39;s it gives
you a power to imagine it&#39;s a medium
where it combines storytelling and
artwork I love television I love movies
and it&#39;s more like somebody else&#39;s work
which we appreciate
and you can get personal you can have a
very personal experience watching a
movie and watching a television series
but it&#39;s not the same as reading a book
and reading a book is perhaps a pure
form of more pure form of literature
literature and comics book is probably
somewhere in between but comics acts
allows you to imagine just like books
and it&#39;s more accessible and since I am
a father of three now I do want this to
be staying around it&#39;s from the 80s it&#39;s
it started
way away ago perhaps in the 20s 1920s so
it&#39;s almost 100 years old but I do want
this to happen I am by profession a
businessman I run I own a CNG station I
am very passionate about Greenfield I&#39;ve
been elected in the board of the
boundary india station for six years and
I am very active about this we are
shareholders in Heidelberg Simmon I got
my family in Tuscon seaman and it&#39;s
councilman was taken about by Heidelberg
and I&#39;m also a sponsor director at a
local ceramic company the reason I&#39;m
saying this is I feel financially stable
and I feel that liberty allows me to do
stuff and you know we pursue your
passion so I can do I I thought okay I
can do this there is a saying in the
community that you cannot make a
business out of selling books we don&#39;t
have good bookstores we had etc which
was excellent
an excellent bookstore it closed down we
had words and pages it closed down we&#39;d
still have bookworm thank God we have
boy be chitra but and PBS they make
their money out of selling stationery
not books so in this world you do need
some kind of color and and I decided
okay let me do this let me do the comic
thing I also do and we have a huge
community the interest is always there I
ran a Facebook group where we have
something like 18,000 members after a
huge filtration I hold a Comic Con
almost annually and we see people in
excess of 10,000 people showing up
paying for the ticket price and it&#39;s a
great thing the love you feel from the
community is the greatest thing the
achievement you can get from doing
something like this although I do want
to mention something here as well doing
something out just out of pure passion
is very dangerous and I do not recommend
doing something out of passion for
business business is business you want
to do business you want to make a make a
living you might want to make money but
if you can and you don&#39;t have to do a
business to you know
satisfy your inner passion you can help
out while I was doing my kamekona
met so many people the best thing about
doing comics here is I realize now that
we have a huge number of crazy people
like me we have a lot of gigs we have a
lot of nerds and we have a community and
it&#39;s it&#39;s so wonderful to be in that
community while I was doing the
comic-con I met the Supreme Court
advocate and he had this back pad in his
office so I went and said you know that
looks so cool like it will can I can I
borrow this for the next comic-con and
he said yes of course
when is when is the where is it when is
it I can just send it I said no no no
it&#39;s it&#39;s let me arrange the
transportation that&#39;s the least I can do
when I did my first Comic Con in 2012/13
stand alone Comic Con I ran out of
manpower because I had no idea we would
have that much response in 2013 I
printed something like 6,000 tickets and
we ended up having more than 11,000 for
2013 so we had severe shortage of people
and of my of the JCC community they were
there were a lot of people who showed up
and said yo entire do you do you need
any help
I said yes I did not I am short of
manpower and they said that we volunteer
and we had something like 20 volunteers
right on the spot and it helped you do
not need to start a business to drive
your passion passion when you&#39;re blind
about it can make you poor after doing
the JCC thing I&#39;ve met with a lot of
people who said I want to do something
like this for example I want
to bring t-shirts or I want to make
posters and sell them that&#39;s a business
right
I said no if you want to do it don&#39;t do
it as a business because you have
nothing to contribute when you make a
t-shirt unless you&#39;re very funny and
you&#39;re very creative I don&#39;t think you
have much of a value addition in this
line so don&#39;t burn yourself you want to
do fun stuff go do fun stuff and be part
of the community but don&#39;t do something
just because you want to do a business
out of passion I feel myself privileged
and I can afford to do this and continue
to do this because I think it&#39;s a good
great thing to have here in Bangladesh
I am also passionate about real business
for example we need the government
support to make sure the greenfield
project which was introduced in 2001
continues and I&#39;ve worked very hard for
that as well but that&#39;s a real business
and this is actually passion so I am
very I&#39;m very happy of all the
experience I&#39;ve gathered following JCCC
and I hope Jessie will be here for a
long time thank you
