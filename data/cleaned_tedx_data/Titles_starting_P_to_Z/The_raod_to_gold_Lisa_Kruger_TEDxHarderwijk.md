first side I look like a normal 17 year
old girl but when I was 16 I had an
experience that very few kids my age
ever experienced
do you remember yourself at that age
chances are that your lifestyle was
pretty similar to the lifestyles of many
16 year old said I know partying
drinking going out with friends well my
life on the other hand looks very
different
four days after my 16th birthday I
became Paralympic champion competing any
women&#39;s 100 meters breaststroke in the
sp9 classification the classification
for people with in lightest physical
disability Paralympic disability what&#39;s
wrong with her I didn&#39;t see anything
weird about her she can&#39;t be that
disabled and that&#39;s exactly how I felt
about myself for many years I must do
everything a normal person can do
because my handicap isn&#39;t that bad I&#39;ll
explain it to you now I was 6 years old
I broke my wrist while playing outside
with my friend he climbed onto a wall
then my parents didn&#39;t allow me to climb
upon but I followed him anyway I fell
from the wall and broke my wrist my left
wrist goes on my bone to protrude from
my skin I had a surgery at a hospital
and after that everything seemed to
recover beautifully despite a huge scar
everything looked normal when I was 10 I
went back to the hospital because my
wrist was growing in a weird way it was
a lot shorter than my right wrist and I
couldn&#39;t make all the movements that I
should have been able to make the doctor
told me that my growth plate was damaged
which caused my bone to grow in this
weird way I had three surgeries that
failed to correct it after that we
decided that more surgeries would only
be likely to make my fame words so we
declined any further treatment even
though my arm looks a bit weird I&#39;ve
never been ashamed of it I see it as a
part of me and something that defines
and to be honest I always like being a
little different than the others
despite dispositive feelings I had to
face the fact that even with my small
disability I am unable to do everything
a normal person can do I knew I wasn&#39;t
able to turn or bend my wrist and I knew
that I wasn&#39;t able to lift heavy objects
but those things never bothered me until
my first weight session when I was 13
years old I have a first weight session
in the gym and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t
able to do exercises using more than 2
kilogram weights in my left arm I wanted
to get stronger and lifting a maximum of
2 kilograms wouldn&#39;t allow me to achieve
that this was the first time my
disability stopped me from reaching my
goal this was the first time I couldn&#39;t
do something I really wanted because of
the handicap it was the first time I
actually felt disabled I also noticed
that the more I swim the more my wrist
would hurt sometimes I had to quit
halfway through practice because of the
pain during this time I felt devastated
for not being able to reach a goal or
improve myself because of a disability
so I cried a lot about it and after a
while I started searching for solutions
and luckily I found those solutions
I use this band to hang weights on so
that I&#39;m able to use heavy weights
during my weight sessions and whenever
we have to do push-ups I get a ball from
somewhere and I put my elbow on it like
this
I also have this brace that I put on
during swimming training where my wrist
hurts it takes away the pressure that
some of my muscles and tendons during
swimming I just described to you the
first time I actually felt disabled but
my disability has stopped me from doing
something I really like before back in
2008 me and my mother saw an article in
the newspaper about a sport called
modern pentathlon this is sport in which
he do 5 sports running swimming shooting
fencing and horseback riding we sign me
up for it and I really liked it but 2010
was the year that the condition of my
arms started to decline fast my mother
got scared that if I would fall from a
horse my wrist will break again because
it&#39;s really breakable if that would
happen my wrist would be even more
messed up than it already was also
shooting became an issue as a ten year
old girl I was not strong enough to hold
the heavy gun in one arm yet so I had to
use two arms the only problem is that if
I&#39;m holding something in my left arm my
wrist starts hurting and shaking now at
two out of five sports were becoming an
issue me and my mother decided that it
was time for me to do another sport
swimming was my best event so we sent me
a free swimming team and I like that
even better than mother Pentagon isn&#39;t
it kind of funny how my disability
stopped me from doing something I really
like but at the same time brought me to
something that wouldn&#39;t change my life
ten years after I fell from the wall I
became Paralympic champion did I expect
that absolutely not it only became clear
to me two months before the games began
that it was actually possible when I
started my Paralympics
women career back in 2012 it was my
biggest dream to participate in the
games I was training for Tokyo 2020 but
making it to the Rio Paralympics will be
even more amazing achievement but in a
very short time of starting swimming
I was achieving huge personal bests and
I continued to improve myself but these
improvements came increased
responsibility and a need for maturity
that I didn&#39;t yet possess when I was 13
I made the biggest mistake in my career
we were training for the European
Championships and qualifying would have
been an amazing achievement at a time I
was a backstroke swimmer and the
qualification time only 100 meters Brak
backstroke was 114 66 I started that
season with a personal best of 1 1942
after 5 months of training
I swam once 1602 I had two months left
to cut you remaining one and a half
seconds so what did I do as a sweet cute
little inexperienced the 13 year old
girl I got lazy I started eating
unhealthy things and now and then I
would skip a few hundred meters of my
training because I wanted to get home as
quickly as possible
I thought that because the first three
seconds were so easy to swim here are
many 1 and a half seconds would go just
as easily well it didn&#39;t
at my last chance of qualifying I swam
113 35 I missed one I have one last
chance of qualifying I swam 118 12 this
was the first time that I did not reach
a goal and it was completely my own
fault
this was the first time that I did not
wish to go and it was my own photo when
I was 13 I learned the hardest the most
important lesson attaining your goals
won&#39;t happen all by themselves Urd
greatest influence your degree is factor
in your journey to your goals and you
are the biggest influence in whether you
make it or not
now making it to the European
Championships changed the way I thought
and three months after I had my last
chance of qualifying I swam 113 35 and I
can&#39;t explain to you how stupid I felt
for nothing that three months earlier
because I knew I was ready for it all
along there are many other things in
life besides sport in which you can set
goals I&#39;m pretty sure there are some
people in here who once started a diet
but quit before they had reached their
ideal weight sure you were happy that
you could eat everything you wanted
again but well if you have been prouder
if the skills showed you the number that
you wanted to see wouldn&#39;t that make you
even happier also what we said as a goal
is very important you must set yourself
high goals in order to achieve big
things the higher is such a go the
harder you have to work to achieve it
and accordingly the prouder you feel
after achieving it you are capable of
doing so much more than you can imagine
and I&#39;m the proof of that six months
before the games began no one would have
thought that I would be the gold
medalist and not even me I dreamed it
might happen but I never thought it was
actually possible to me winning the gold
medal seemed like an impossible thing to
do but even so I made it my goal and it
actually happened but it took me a lot
of effort
I trained relentlessly I put in as much
effort
and time as possible and I swam many
many kilometers
I learned the lessons from my lazy 13
year old self and I knew that I had a
fight on and work even harder than ever
before to attain this goal to reach this
goal I am now seventeen and I have found
that people have expectations of me that
wouldn&#39;t be put on many adults as an
athlete you can&#39;t drink alcohol you
can&#39;t go to parties and you are barely
able to find time to see your friends
and family I think I&#39;ve met up with my
friends about six times in the past year
meeting them is only possible when I&#39;m
not swimming not going to school and
when I have the energy to get out of my
bed as an athlete you have to consider
the impact on your sports career with
everything you do in life your sport has
to be your number one priority and there
are many talented athletes that fail at
maintaining his mindset I think most
Dutch people remember the story of
beautiful Felder during the Rio Olympics
he qualified for the Rings final but
left the Olympic Park to have a drink
with some friends as a result he got
sent home by the dutch Olympic Committee
before he could compete in the finals
alcohol and sport are not a great
combination and as an athlete you have
to resist those sensations and there are
many temptations it&#39;s so easy to skip
practice a favor of going out with your
friends I think you can imagine how hard
it is for a teenager to be so dedicated
to a sport but if I am able to improve
myself if I am able to resist those
sensations if I am able to find
solutions to my problems if I am able to
handle the expectations that people have
of me as a sweet little girl the you
adults don&#39;t have any excuse for not
trying to reach your goals
[Applause]
