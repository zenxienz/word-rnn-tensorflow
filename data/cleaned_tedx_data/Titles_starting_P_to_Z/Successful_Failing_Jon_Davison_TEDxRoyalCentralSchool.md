I want to talk about failure yeah it&#39;s
good successful failure but one of the
other titles I had I got a bit confused
with the titles was failing to fail so
there&#39;s somewhere in between success and
I mean good and bad failure anyway
that&#39;s why I&#39;m going to talk about is
confusing isn&#39;t it right I hope I&#39;m
going to clarify it if I don&#39;t then
well I won&#39;t sorry about all the humor
I&#39;m a clown it&#39;s my job I&#39;ve been doing
it for 30 something years as a performer
director writer researcher and general
interested in anything to do with clowns
so that&#39;s my perspective that&#39;s really
the perspective I&#39;m going to come at
failure from there may be others but
that&#39;s minor that&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do so
failure well clowns so before we go any
further all clowns
oh no what&#39;s that come on you know what
a clown is everyone knows what a clown
is I&#39;m Eve and I have faith in the whole
of humanity nearly in the whole of
history knows what a clown is we don&#39;t
have to explain what it is however just
a little bit of our introduction we&#39;ll
make clear that we all know what a clown
is so different people have different
ideas
some people think of clowns is someone
with a particular costume or others not
only that one obviously that&#39;s an
example
yeah there&#39;s not what does one costume
the whole clown share I mean come on
that&#39;sthat&#39;s Pepito&#39;s costume that&#39;s
Pepito or others might just think of a
clown&#39;s particular makeup likewise this
you know you don&#39;t share to make me take
it off your face and shit anyway it&#39;s
getting a little bit absurd sorry or you
might think of a crowd just as just as
the nose yeah
other people don&#39;t see things so
visually they think of things more in
terms of actions so you might think of a
clown as someone who drops the trousers
there not everyone who drops the
trousers is the clown it depends on the
context the conventions will come back
to context of conventions later it&#39;s
very important in clowning or you might
think of a clown someone who makes a
mess or make some messes and again you
know not happy every time you make a
mess doesn&#39;t mean your clown or ah he&#39;s
an interesting one behave like animals
same thing yeah just because you behave
like an animal doesn&#39;t mean your clown
or defy the laws of the human body and
generally of of nature yeah so that&#39;s
yeah in terms of what clowns do others a
little bit more let&#39;s say intellectual
which we all are think of clowns aren&#39;t
we yes it says of concepts general
things like being stupid that&#39;s a
concept that&#39;s an abstract it&#39;s not
something you can do I don&#39;t do stupid
it&#39;s an abstract yeah or being silly or
actually or just being childish yeah
that&#39;s me
haven&#39;t changed a little bit higher up
the intellectual ladder if you like in
terms of understandable clowns are
culturally specific now here&#39;s an
interesting one um in one part of the
world certain number of people but not
all of them but I&#39;m using this as an
interesting example certain number of
people would think of clowns as people
who control the traffic yes you all know
what I&#39;m talking about you&#39;re talking
about the clown and mime a professionals
employed by the city of Caracas in
Venezuela you all know that no you
wouldn&#39;t know it if you were from
Caracas and you knew something about
clowns no culturally-specific
also if you were from an indigenous
village in certain part of New Mexico
you would regard clowns is not just
being funny as being responsible also
for fertility and a good crop now one
last thing into the reaches of what
clowns are armed if you&#39;re a historian
of the English word clown was coined was
first used to mean someone who&#39;s not a
gentleman
just because you&#39;re not the gentleman on
stage doesn&#39;t mean you clam by the way
yeah
historically live it later on you might
people thought clowns were those people
who defied the devil and death or didn&#39;t
like policemen and beat them up
interesting though that&#39;s from Georgian
England around the time of Grimaldi the
most famous English clown beating
policeman up wasn&#39;t the only thing
clowns would do they would also trip
little old ladies up so that was the
idea of what clown would be then we have
a prankster
however today as evolution goes goes
we&#39;ve evolved into failure so many or
perhaps most people who take themselves
seriously in clowning what they&#39;re doing
think tend to think of clowns as those
who are experts in failure so that&#39;s
where we&#39;re going to go for but not only
clowns
see we&#39;ve come back to my to the theme
failure so Clara is actually could they
all be explained by failure well let&#39;s
go with a failure from a clown point of
view but not only clowns are interesting
in failure in lots of lots of people
have been interested in failure business
people think that failure and being
slightly clownish yourself is a good way
to greater productivity this book is all
about that how to make more capitalism
by being a failure why not
then there&#39;s quite a few self-help books
on how not to strive for success
ie failure will help you be happier will
gloss over that at the moment and then
of course performance study is very
important subject for academic writing
these days of failure so there you go
important areas of wisdom in our
contemporary society business self-help
and the Academy oh and there&#39;s that
other one what is it yeah oh yeah the
internet meme it&#39;s about being wrong
failure anyway yeah very popular these
days so what is it about failure that
we&#39;re so fascinated in and why do we
think it&#39;s so interesting useful for us
and is it a good thing that fascination
who is it a bad thing that&#39;s what I&#39;m
interested in let&#39;s go with I want to
demonstrate a little bit how I teach
people to be clowns because I could
teach students of clowning so that you
get an idea about how failure might work
for a let&#39;s call it a contemporary clown
so I&#39;m gonna need a clown student now
don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not going to ask for
volunteers so because you&#39;re not clown
students you can&#39;t have come here to
look stupid I think
no you haven&#39;t good and don&#39;t worry you
I don&#39;t even ask you to be an audience
to these cloud students and you don&#39;t
have to laugh yeah fight nobody has to
laugh ever I would say there you go
you can no you don&#39;t have to but you
know not forbidden either yeah I can&#39;t
tell you what to do so here&#39;s my clown
student for today yeah cuz I didn&#39;t want
to use a real person because all ethical
problems with that so here&#39;s a little
exercise which I&#39;m very fond of and I
use incessantly and it&#39;s called the
steppe laugh and how it works is that
when when the audience for the student
which would have been you if you were
that but you&#39;re not so don&#39;t worry don&#39;t
have to love so the audience for the
student when they laugh the student will
take a step forward
yeah forwards me let&#39;s say across the
stage yeah and when they don&#39;t laugh for
a time they take a step back that&#39;s
that&#39;s you just have to pick up on the
laughter yeah so basically that&#39;s that&#39;s
it so so that&#39;s my instruction to the
chair blue chair so when there&#39;s
laughter you take a step yeah
listen I have the silence it goes back
Oh anyway so you see it&#39;s going
backwards and forwards the ideal place
to be is somewhere in here in the middle
yeah so that that&#39;s interesting now that
exercise hasn&#39;t come out nowhere that&#39;s
come out the hole a hole what&#39;s the word
yeah tradition let&#39;s say a recent
tradition 50 years old perhaps Jacques
Lecoq the trainer of performers got
interested in clowns in the early
sixties and came up with an exercise
which was oh you get up and make us
laugh
they didn&#39;t make anyone laugh and they
sat down again and everyone laughed ha
ha I found the teaching method for
clowning and there&#39;s now there&#39;s a very
technical word for this arm which you
need to know if you go into clowning and
that word is flop and you&#39;ve just seen
some flops here which this marvelous
blue chairs done it attempted to get
across the stage fails too because you
didn&#39;t laugh move back got a laugh
succeeded so just to get that in a head
it&#39;s try to be funny
failed to be funny equals be funny
that&#39;s the flop yeah it&#39;s a bit
difficult if you&#39;re not good at maths
maybe that&#39;s a bit you know it&#39;s like
because it&#39;s really contradictory so
like one of those paradoxes but you know
you write it you see it works but Lacock
himself and many others weren&#39;t just
intrigued by the fact that this provoked
laughter but also what he thought he saw
was a whole lot of other things that
when this this flop happened was that
the person in his words was stripped
bare yeah so um by that I think he meant
or what he explains is that we could see
the authentic self these are the kinds
of words there will be
used in the 60s cuz we don&#39;t use those
words anymore do we hmm the authentic
self the spontaneous vulnerability of
this stripped bare person that we can
see without their social masks and their
attempts to be clever and convince us
and so on and so on
yeah interesting interpretation now if
you just now when the chair was doing
the exercise felt that you saw it
stripped bare
you will be an agreement with the
majority of clown teachers since 1962
now ah but of course the cock didn&#39;t use
chairs he used people and most Klan
teachers use people but if if it could
be you saw the vulnerability of the
chair you would be in agreement with him
yeah I&#39;m not gonna ask you can I want to
embarrass you
which ways embarrassing if you saw it
you didn&#39;t see it
ha however if you didn&#39;t see the
vulnerability of the chair you might be
agreeing in agreement with me um who I
didn&#39;t see it I saw a formula for making
you laugh which is the intention of
clowns no hang on a minute
ah the other thing I wanted to ask you
sorry about that is ask yourselves is if
you felt that you saw the vulnerability
of the chair what did it feel like when
you laughed when that chair moved back I
moved it back and you laughed what kind
of a laugh was that was the same kind of
laugh as if I told you joke like I know
what&#39;s brown and sticky a stick yeah so
if you laughed at that did you laugh cos
it&#39;s a funny joke what did you laugh
because it wasn&#39;t a funny joke um what&#39;s
the difference and if you think the
laugh because it wasn&#39;t funny is more
real than the other laugh then you&#39;ll
have agree with Lou Cox that something
real something more real has been
exposed and revealed but however as I
said there&#39;s this little formula and
there try to be funny fail to be funny
be funny now I don&#39;t know about you both
school maths
wasn&#39;t really sold to me so he talked to
me as a means of achieving authenticity
yeah like two plus two equals four a
moment of Revelation I was for the first
person who got it obviously yeah it&#39;s a
Eureka yeah or maybe it is when you
realize how it works I on maybe have to
revise Allah anyway but formulas don&#39;t
usually lead us to authenticity they&#39;re
not supposed to at least but here is a
nice little formula which does lead you
to laugh and perhaps believe love has
been somehow more real than if I came
out here and said okay this is really
funny laugh at this and you laugh at it
huh anyway so so there you go so it&#39;s up
to you as I said in the end with you
laugh or not or it&#39;s up to you whether
you feel obviously what do you feel
about the laughter whether it reveals
something authentic or not but I would
say that remember this is all being done
by a clown yeah by clowns clowns another
thing they didn&#39;t come up on there on
the slides was how clowns love to fool
each other and to fool you the audience
that&#39;s our business so if we&#39;ve got a
formula for fooling you into thinking
something&#39;s true we&#39;ll use it so I would
say well I&#39;m going taking away that idea
of failure these two authenticity we
could change the world with it by the
way the world Parliament of clowns acts
on that premise the world&#39;s Parliament
of clowns believes that by bringing the
message of the flop to politicians and
business leaders in the world we will
have a more just and compassionate
society that&#39;s the side so this is
important work being done based on the
belief in failure but I would suggest to
you but rather than believing in
something like that just have a look and
see the trick and the illusion that&#39;s
created and then maybe something might
change if you we understand how
illusions work thank you very much
you
