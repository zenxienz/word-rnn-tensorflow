hello everyone my name is Prue and my
name is Nicola now people don&#39;t seem to
trust us why because we&#39;re magicians
when we come out on stage with non
ordinary objects such as a handkerchief
people automatically become a bit
suspicious because well why would two
teenage girls be holding a handkerchief
in 2017 and they&#39;re right not to trust
us it&#39;s only there for misdirection Prue
what&#39;s misdirection misdirection
misdirection is the actual process of
directing someone to the wrong place or
in the wrong direction thanks google
while you&#39;re watching the hankerchief
you don&#39;t notice the came behind it so
instead of using objects that look as
though they could be purchased at a
magic shop we&#39;re going to be using some
objects from the audience so put your
hand up if you have some money like a
$10 note in fact take that Tindall and
art out and hold it up nice and high
could you please stand up for us
everyone please give our volunteer round
applause as the usher will lead you on
the stage as magicians we&#39;re often asked
is magic real face or fake we hope by
the end of you guys watching this act
that you&#39;ll be able to answer that
question every Australian $10 note is
different it has two letters from the
alphabet followed by an eight digit
number
this combination of letters and numbers
makes up the serial number and every
serial number is unique ID Sam inference
Leslie what&#39;s your name Zach well done
that&#39;s correct
Zach lovely to meet you thank you for
helping us out and thank you for lending
us your $10 note we&#39;ll make sure you get

something else so I went to my favorite
place in the entire world my pantry and
picked up a snack cinder eaters can you

throughout the entire show and not
switching it or faking it at any point
