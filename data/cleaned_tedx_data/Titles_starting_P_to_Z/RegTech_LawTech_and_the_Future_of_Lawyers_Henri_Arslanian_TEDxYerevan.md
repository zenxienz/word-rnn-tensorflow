Harry Lewis good morning
very very excited to be here this
morning let me start by asking all of
you a question I want you to think about
the last time you had to enter into an
important legal contract Salem say a new
employment contract for a new job or
release for a new apartment you probably
would have liked to consult a lawyer
right but you probably didn&#39;t as you
taught like many others that it would be
too expensive I want you to think about
a time that you&#39;re confronted with a
situation where you needed to understand
what your rights were like the sudden
death of a family member or being
unexpectedly fired from your job
was finding the right information easy
probably not well you&#39;re not alone even
in a country like the United States with
one of the highest ratios of lawyers per
capita around 80 percent of the
population does not have access to legal
services and it&#39;s actually bigger and
broader problem than that the United
Nations estimates that around 4 billion
people around the world are actually
excluded from the rule of law but would
it be great if we can actually change
that well we may have a chance using the
latest innovations in the field of legal
technology and the regulatory technology
law tech or reptak for short latte or
rep tech are the use of new technologies
from artificial intelligence
to blockchain that can help us deliver
not only legal services better and more
efficiently but also help us tackle the
regulatory and compliance burdens more
efficiently and more effectively and
what I want to show you what you off
today is how these latest innovations in
the field of law second rack tech will
not only change centuries old
professions like being a lawyer but will
allow us to conceptually change many of
the big concepts we&#39;ve had like trust
contracts and access to justice and this
will have not only impact on each one of
you in the room today but billions of
people around the world let me give you
one example imagine next time you have a
legal question you can take out your
smart phone and ask a robot lawyer for
the answer well some la tech startups
are building just that legal chat BOTS
these messaging apps allow you to
actually talked as if you&#39;re talking to
a human lawyer but actually instead
you&#39;re talking to a computer program who
can answer you anytime anywhere when
answers to your basic legal questions
just for example imagine you separate
with your partner and you want to know
what are the relevant custody rules that
apply for your children or you&#39;re a
single mom and want to know what state
benefits are available to you well the
most complex and bespoke legal questions
will and should be answered by human
lawyers the reality is that we can now
program a lot of basic legal answers
into decision trees and deliver this via
chat BOTS to the public at large via
tools that people use every day from
facebook messenger in the West and in
Armenia to tools like WeChat in Asia and
where this becomes really powerful is
when we are able to help those who need
it the most
think about refugees looking at making
asylum claims in that instance the
chatbot accessible via any smartphone
can ask the relevant questions determine
what are the rights of that individual
propose some options and potentially
file all that the refugees our behalf
allows us to actually help the people
who need it the most and do it in a cost
effective way and scalable way and with
advances were making right now with
voice recognition technology and voice
as a user interface we are finally able
to offer these services to the 750
million people around the world who are
illiterate and who cannot read and write
500 million of them being in developing
countries and being women but even when
you look beyond when you look beyond the
most vulnerable the reality is that
legal services are still not accessible
to them even the middle class when I was
starting out as a young lawyer in Canada
and in Hong Kong one of the things we
would do for corporate clients was to go
to hundreds of past cases to find the
specific ones that would have helped our
clients case that&#39;s quite common in the
practice of law but it&#39;s a bit like
sending a human to find a needle in a
haystack
according to some studies lawyers spend
up to quarter and in certain cases up to
one-third of their time doing such
research not only this actually makes it
very costly for those who can afford it
but also acts as another barrier to
access to legal services including for
the middle class well the good news is
now we have a lot of actually law tech
technology&#39;s solutions being built by
startups powered by artificial
intelligence that can go to all the
available case law and intelligently
flag the ones and summarize the ones
that the lawyer should focus on not only
on key terms but because of the context
as well
allowing us to bring down the work that
would take hours into minutes and
bringing down the cost of legal services
and making it more accessible but when
you look at this actually often the
question that comes up is how can we
actually use these technologies to solve
the big global problems the ones are a
cross-border
a transnational level and the good news
is we can now use some of these RAC tech
solutions to solve these problems as
well at least try to let me give you the
example of global money laundering today
banks around the world spend billions of
dollars a year to try to spot and stop
funds coming from criminal organizations
and those coming from corrupt
politicians the goal is to stop these
funds from entering the global financial
system because once there they can go to
fund terrorism human trafficking or
other corrupt practices that end up
affecting us all the process actually is
actually pretty big problem the United
Nations estimates that the global volume
of money-laundering transactions around
the world is between 1 to 2 trillion US
dollars a year and the problem is were
able today to stop less than 1% of that
amount which means that despite all our
efforts all our efforts against global
maunder money laundering have in
practice failed one of the reasons
actually is that the process is still
very manual it&#39;s very costly
time-consuming and prone to mistakes and
here again we have a lot of rat tech
solutions now that can not only do the
work that are being done today by humans
better and faster but also you can
plug-in into these rat tech solutions
big tons of data and the a I can
actually go spot the patterns that even
a human money-laundering the fists
officer could never even spot and this
actually not only and the beauty of
these solutions is
the more we train them the more data we
give them the system becomes even more
accurate allowing us to get one step
closer to stopping the funds from these
corrupt politicians from entering the
global financial system but where this
becomes really exciting with logic and
reptak is when we&#39;re able to take these
new technologies and completely
transform how we do things one
technology that enables us to do this is
blockchain technology you&#39;ve all
probably heard about blockchain by now
but to keep it simple
it&#39;s really database that is
decentralized basically not staying at
the same place immutable once the
transactions are agreed they cannot be
changed and consensus-based
for a transaction to go on it everybody
has to agree and blockchain will change
many facets of our lives over the coming
years but now it will have also a
particular impact in the field of law
let me give you an example today in most
countries if you want to go buy a house
you have to go see a lawyer or a notary
depending whether you&#39;re in a common-law
or a civil our jurisdiction that
individual will perform some checks say
to ensure that the house you&#39;re buying
from actually really belongs to the
seller but also will try to verify that
the title you&#39;re buying is clear of any
hidden mortgages or other liens attached
to it
once again the process is not only
costly but not very efficient
and by the way that is not even the big
problem the problem is that for most of
the world that legal title does not even
exist again according to the World Bank
70% of the world&#39;s population does not
have access to proper land titling to
put that in economic terms some experts
estimate that the value of debt capital
in which people do not have access to
the legal title to the land the house
the car and other assets that they own
at around 20 trillion u.s. dollars
and the problem with this it traps
people into this vicious cycle of
poverty you cannot borrow money based on
the land that you have in the house you
have but also you can lose the roof that
you have at any moment or the one who
just thought you paid for and probably
even worse than this you are at the
mercy of corrupt government officials
who can come and amend those land titles
whenever they want an exchange of bribes
a problem that I still unfortunately
common in many countries around the
world
well blockchain could be part of the
solution not only putting land title
transactions on the blockchain makes it
cheaper to buy and sell houses as you
don&#39;t need those lawyers anymore or
notaries to act as those trusted
intermediaries as the blockchain can do
that work but most importantly actually
makes it practically impossible for
corrupt government officials to amend
these land titles and take the property
away from those who probably deserve it
the most and the advances we&#39;re making
the space are actually quite impressive
let me give you another example
contracts all of you enter into
contracts every day from buying goods
online to actually clicking to accepting
those terms and conditions that you
never read the reality is actually legal
documents right now legal agreements are
actually not only lengthy and ambiguous
but in many cases in most cases you need
to actually rely on a third party to
enforce it in the event that your
contract counterparty does not fulfill
its obligations actually enforcing it is
actually very costly and time-consuming
you have to first find them hire lawyers
go to court and hope that you&#39;re going
to end up with an impartial judge who&#39;s
going to set the record straight
the last point as we all know it is not
only not practical and not it doesn&#39;t
exist in many countries around the world
but even when it does it&#39;s very cost
prohibitive
and actually this is actually where we
could have blockchain be part of the
solution solution as well when we&#39;re
doing this is via what we call smart
contracts smart contracts are actually
programming code on certain block chains
most notably the etherium blockchain it
allows you to not only facilitate and
execute contracts using on blockchain
technology the smart contract code will
actually set the rules the obligations
and the benefits as a normal contract
would but the smart contract would
automatically execute them upon the
occurrence of a certain event for
example let&#39;s say you make a bet with
your friend on the outcome of a football
game we&#39;re the winning with the winner
we&#39;re actually automatically get paid by
that smart contract as soon as the game
is over or imagine buying the travel
insurance policy or the smart contract
would automatically pay you as soon as
your flight is delayed smart contracts
allow us actually to code not only the
obligations of the parties have agreed
to but automatically execute them upon
the occurrence of often a public of
verifiable and available information in
the examples I just gave the results of
sports games or the flight landing and
departure times which are all public and
again blockchain today&#39;s day we&#39;re still
that use cases are quite narrow but the
beauty of it that you are starting and
we&#39;re so very very far from getting rid
of traditional contracts but we are able
to solve some of the most long-standing
problems we&#39;ve had in many years of
actually contract enforcement and
counterparty risk so all these examples
that I mentioned are very very exciting
and the field of law tech and rep Tech
will really transform the world we live
in in the coming years however it&#39;s
important to understand that we&#39;re still
in the very very early days a lot of the
use case that I mentioned will succeed
but many many of them will fail but we
are so many people trying this around
the world to fix these problems
that I&#39;m confident we will actually get
there many of us in the global log law
Tech and rec tech community are working
not only with the regulatory and legal
practitioners but also with governments
and regulators to ensure that we have
the right ecosystem in place to allow
these technologies to flourish but we
also need the legal industry the
regulatory practitioners themselves to
be willing to change for example for the
legal chatbot example that I gave it
will be interesting to see if Bar
Association Bar Association&#39;s and law
societies will be willing to embrace
these new technologies or actually to
try to block them as their competition
to human lawyers a bit like the tax the
industry did with the arrival of uber
and other ride-sharing devices come back
to my initial example in the u.s. you
have more than 1.3 million licensed
lawyers and that&#39;s not include even the
large number of paralegals and
regulatory staff that do a lot of the
monotonous and actually time-consuming
work many studies over the years have
tried to predict the impact technology
will have on lawyers some predict that
25% to 40% of legal jobs will disappear
to other more extreme ones actually
predict the structural collapse of law
firms the reality is actually more
nuanced than that yes many jobs will
disappear
a lot of the monotonous regular
time-consuming work done by lawyers will
disappear but technology is still very
far from disrupting some of the real
value added work that lawyers can
provide like strategizing negotiating
making common-sense judgments or even
visiting a client in jail but it&#39;s true
that many jobs will disappear
but also new ones will be created think
about smart contract quoting lawyers or
regulatory data sign
and it&#39;s very important as well that
we&#39;ve tried to focus to train the next
generation of legal talent to be ready
not only for these roles but for this
new reality they&#39;re gonna live in I
remember a joke when I was in law school
that went like this how many lawyers
does it take to change a light bulb
the answer as many as you could afford
I&#39;m hoping with the changes going on and
for the years to come in the coming year
is the answer to the question of how
many lawyers does it take to change a
light bulb will change to only one the
one who built the chatbot and programmed
the smart contract thank you
[Applause]
