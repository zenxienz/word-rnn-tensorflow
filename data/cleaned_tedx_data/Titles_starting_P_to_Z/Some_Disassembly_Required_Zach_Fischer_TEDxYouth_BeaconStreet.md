hi I&#39;m Zach Fisher and ever since fourth
grade I&#39;ve been a problem solver now
you&#39;re probably wondering well what
happened in fourth grade did I have a
cool teacher or go to a cool class or
even come see a cool TED talk no it was
better when I was in fourth grade I
guess on my very own computer explode
before my eyes it was the coolest thing
I&#39;d ever seen
watching the components one by one get
engulfed in smoke and flames was so cool
but what I remember being cooler was
watching the computer tech put it all
back together the complexity of
components which he finessed with ease
into a brand new computer just left me
dumbfounded this really sparked my
interest in computers and technology in
general six years later I walk into that
mighty Media Lab I&#39;m interning at a tech
startup called core sites and walking in
and seeing other kids is a little bit
intimidating but what I really remember
was being fascinated of course it does a
biofeedback based virtual reality
company working out of MIT
we specialize in teaching you how to
control your heart rate with your
breathing the product that corsets is
currently working on is a piece of
software that can be used across
industries to reduce anxiety we do this
by using a virtual reality headset and
the biofeedback sensor placed on your
finger trust me
it&#39;s cool on my first day of course I
heard some talk with the technology
behind our sensor and my co-workers were
talking about how it was cool but it was
kind of big and bulky it was expensive
we&#39;re talking like $300 so it&#39;s a nice
naive 14 year old I thought to myself I
bet I could build a better one and I bet
I could do it for cheaper on my second
day of course it&#39;s I designed a new
finger sensor for seven dollars I spent
the previous night watching MS YouTube
videos researching a ton and not
sleeping and I came in the next day of
the finish schematic of my design after
hours of research I realized that all
the basic finger sensor was was an
inferred emitter
an infrared detector mounted really
close to your finger and based on the
amount of light the detector received we
could determine if there was blood
flowing through your finger and then get
a heartbeat it was pretty simple now
every time people ask me every time I
tell this story people always ask well
how&#39;d you come up with the idea of
designing a finger sensor on your very
first day there how&#39;d you even get the
courage to suggest a redesign as I said
before my curiosity for problem solving
was not a recent development it all
started with the exploding computer now
after watching that computer explode in
fourth grade I spent the next couple
years learning everything there was to
know about modern day pcs and I rebuilt
my computer over and over and over again
why well not just for the flashy new
LEDs but because there was always
something wrong with my computer
he&#39;s never fast enough for me I was one
of the more GPU or CPU performance I
found the problem and I fixed it it was
easy
two years later and sixth grade
I saw the most amazing drone footage of
chair Noble it was almost as cool as the
exploding computer after seeing this I
realized I just needed the drone so I
got a job I worked some hours and I
bought myself one except just over a
month in my drone had a fatal crash now
flying this drone was one of my favorite
things to do I mean I was the only kid
in sixth grade with a drone how cool is
that and right now this show was broken
I was devastated I was willing to do
whatever it took to get this thing back
in the air so I tried everything I could
think of I turned it on and then off and
then on it didn&#39;t work after many hours
of trying that I realized that there was
a pretty big difference between my drone
in its current state and the drone in
the flying state and I needed to do
something about it so I look for a local
mentor someone who could teach me how
drones worked how to fly drones had a
fixed route how to build drones anything
but I found no one I started
binge-watching drone YouTube videos
YouTube became my personal mentor this
is when I knew I was a certified nerd
now after hours of research I realized
that what was wrong with my drone was
that a broken motor and to fix this
motor I would need to learn how to
solder now soldering is essentially the
process of using a 750 degree pencil to
melt metal to join wires and to make an
electrical connection and after teaching
myself to do this I had to learn that
tree burn wounds
I remember just a few months after
fixing my first drone I set out to build
a drone from scratch now this is an
incredibly ambitious project because the
drones I&#39;ve been working with previously
already had an existing framework laid
out I knew everything went I knew how
everything worked it was simple it made
sense to me but for this drone I would
literally have to start from the ground
up now the first time after I watched
that drone fly I realized what I had
just done
alright spent the past couple of weeks
working endlessly in my basement to get
every part of this drone to work exactly
like it should and it did and now it was
in the air and it was flying I felt like
I could do anything
picture that drunk so if you&#39;re gonna
take one thing away from this talk it&#39;s
that the difference between you and me
is simply this when I was in fourth
grade I got to see my computer explode
that&#39;s it now nothing you should go home
and let your computer on fire seriously
don&#39;t but every runner it&#39;s in there get
inspired break things fix things go nuts
thank you
