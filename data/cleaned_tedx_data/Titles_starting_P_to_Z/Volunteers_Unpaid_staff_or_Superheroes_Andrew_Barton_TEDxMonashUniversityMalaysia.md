so the title of my talk today volunteers
unpaid star for superheroes well I&#39;m
going to dodge the question slightly and
I tried to think about what to say I
remember as a 13 or 14 year old the
advice of my English language teacher
who after giving me yet another c-minus
for my work said write me an essay about
something that you have experienced so I
went away and I wrote about trout
fishing with my father in the Highlands
of Scotland and to my surprise and
amazement I got named so I put that
lesson to good use in talks and speeches
that I&#39;ve given since the questions that
came to me were why do we volunteer and
what is volunteering do we volunteer to
assuage our conscience it&#39;s about the
giving something back for you because we
have the time to or we can afford to for
myself speaking as a late baby boomer
where my life and career was still
trying to be mapped out for me I have
been a casual volunteer for a good part
of my life but it&#39;s only in the last two
years that I have been getting serious
about it if we look at what is
volunteering I can think of two options
the informal the footwall by informal I
mean such activities as helping at a
church event running a university club
like this a lot of volunteers today or
helping somebody to rebuild their house
things I suspect many of us here have
have done or do or take take part in
warming the formal approach implies
structure and commitment and sacrifice I
qualified as a dinghy sailing instructor
I gave up my weekend as a barest weeks
in the summer to teach maybe kids to
sail I went to Nepal for five months to
build schools and I&#39;m here in Malaysia
for four months to help a community find
a way forward the example I gave of
helping to rebuild build school houses
is one that could span across both
approaches I have spent many weekends
friends with their house expansions but
in 2016 I spent 10 months working
alongside my brother-in-law as he
completely refurbished his house so why
does someone who was managing partner of
affirmative surveyors with 10 years to
go to retirement and reasonably
financially secure suddenly changed
course and faced total uncertainty and
insecurity that&#39;s certainly the question
my daughters asked me when I told him I
plan to do this I suspect that the
majority of the audience here today
would be classified as Millennials and
the refreshing thing about you is that
even though you might qualify as
engineers or lawyers there seems to be
no commitment to following that course
to retirement I would say at this point
of course my perspective on business
from a Western approach so it may be
that you have a different but I will
soldier on that basis now I realize that
I might be generalizing a bit here and
equally as I said this could apply more
to Western society but of the four
Millennials that I&#39;m currently working
with to don&#39;t have a job to go to at the
end of our program at the moment one is
taking a sabbatical and only one of the
four is Western so there&#39;s a very
scientific dubious scientific data for
you but in my travels over the last two
years I have met a big cross-section of
age groups the time and again people
were taking time out either in a
structured way for a sabbatical or
having left their jobs with no clear
plans as to what they were going to do
on their return I find this incredibly
refreshing it&#39;s all about going on a
journey literally and metaphorically the
Millennials with no fixed ideas about
career paths are doing it early on are
the baby boomers and Generation X&#39;s are
turning to it later in life that said
those of us who are over over 50 have
more divided ulema I think the reaction
I get from those I talk to you ranges
from that&#39;s very clear
Regus or noble of you - wishing that
they could do the same thing a bit being
very envious and some have admitted even
to living vicariously through me as I
told my adventures through mine what&#39;s a
true my parents had a strong sense of
duty and values and their lives were led
with a very clear path in front of them
but they lived in incredible times my
father was was in the colonial service
working here in KL and then in subber
until independence in 1963 my sister was
born in KL and I was born in Sabah and I
believe that my formative years out out
here have eight what I&#39;m trying to
achieve what is all this got to do with
volunteering I think I&#39;m trying to set
the scene and again referring back to my
English teacher talking about my
experiences volunteering is a way of
putting something back even if you can&#39;t
change your life and run off to Africa
or Asia you can still make a difference
to other people&#39;s lives have an open
mind be prepared to change I think too
many people don&#39;t do something because
they feel the time isn&#39;t right but
that&#39;s a copper because when you think
the time is right that will have passed
so listen to your heart
don&#39;t be ruled by your head remember
this isn&#39;t too dry run I have had what
could be defined defined as two midlife
crises in my forties when I was under
huge pressures at work and leading a
very full home life with a growing
family
I checked out for a while and then again
in my 50s but in a very different way it
was more of a realization that this was
the time to change thankfully I listened
to my heart and seized the day
carpe diem in which more fully or the
translation will fully seize the day but
very little trust
tomorrow I believe I have been living
like this for a while now so how did I
get standing here in front of you today
well towards the end of 2015 a friend of
mine challenged me to go somewhere where
I had always wanted to so with some
trepidation I booked a flight to Buenos
Aires and spent two months traveling
around Argentina Chile and Bolivia and
had a wonderful time and proved that I
could survive on my own I then spent the
rest of the year working with my brother
and brother-in-law rebuilding their
health Umbria farmhouse during that time
I was researching getting into disaster
reconstruction and humanitarian aid work
and realizing that I needed to do more
volunteering to prove to those who might
give their job that I was serious and
for me with the earthquake still fairly
fresh in the mind the Paul was the
obvious place to go by chance when I was
looking at the website of the company
that one of my daughter&#39;s was working
for I saw the police support they
sponsored a charity who were involved in
education in Nepal so I wrote to them
and asked if I could be of any help they
said no but their sister charity the
farha trust you the paja trust / Nepal
had been building schools out there for
25 years so I wrote to them and after
some chewing and throwing they offered
me a job
unpaid as project manager to run a
couple of rebuilds in loungin district
bingo and so in early January of this
year I landed in Kathmandu with a
three-month tourist visa that&#39;s all the
volunteers do have work visas cost a
fortune involve a pile of paperwork my
base for the three months was to be
progra which is a wonderful city with
the annapurna range as its back the two
schools i was working that the two
schools were I was working were an eight
a two hour bus ride and one of those
amazing local buses where which are the
lifeline of the communities in the in
they stop for everybody and take
everything the journeys were in equal
measure breathtaking on account of the
scenery that he passed through and
terrifying when looking out at the open
bus door to attack a 1000 foot drop
inches away in fact there were two
occasions when there was a mass exodus
from the bus as the ground that we were
driving over started give way the second
of my two schools was in a Finnish
called gamma ray which was at the end of
the road at a rate of six and a half
thousand feet and at the eastern end of
the annapurna range in the shadow of the
landrum him all the school itself would
be badly damaged in the earthquake and
the first story had been taken down it
became apparent when I got on site but
the plans I had been given for the
project were totally inaccurate so my
first job was to resurvey and redesign
the whole thing and then go back to poke
or arms to their contractor during the
steel work and agree the redesign after
that there were battles with the
suppliers materials with rivet but
delivered by tractor and trailer from
the nearest town which is four hours
away but no one wanted to make the trip
up the mountain so it was always a
struggle when the materials finally
arrived the tractor was usually driven
by a couple of lads who invariably got
to stock or drop things in the wrong
place but we persevered equally getting
the workforce to stay was a constant
problem and often at the time when I was
told by my young Nepali project
supervisor that the men were leaving
that morning never thinking that I
needed to know a week in advance so that
we could line up replacements advance
planning simply doesn&#39;t feature in a
Nepali mindset but throughout so one of
this was the delight from seeing the
children every morning with bright eyes
up bright eyes and a welcoming namaste
so eager to
learning and they would follow me around
and prod each other
to dare someone to ask me a question in
English and my response would induce
fits of giggles my stay coincided with
the end of term so I was roped in as the
special guest to do the honors for the
prize-giving and when I left they had a
special feast and they&#39;re worth
presentations and speeches and I was
quite overwhelmed but their gratitude
was hot and I was very humbled by the
experience unfortunately I wasn&#39;t able
to stay to the end of the project but
this is the building now completed and
being occupied just before I arrived in
Nepal someone told me about another IMG
a All Hands volunteers and they look
like an interesting organization so I
applied to join them and they were they
were in the pool within 72 hours of the
earthquake and are still there now and
for the foreseeable future they have a
base in sin Tobacco district and have
built six or seven schools having
obtained funding from partner
organization the model is pretty unique
when it comes to charities in the third
sector they&#39;re looking for people of any
age quite literally to work for a few
days or a few months it doesn&#39;t matter
they provide food and accommodation and
they&#39;re charging nothing the only
provider is that you will work and it
doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t know how to
wield a hammer you just need to have
enthusiasm and energy and a sense of
humor we were building to two classroom
buildings as part of the schools that
have been badly damaged in the
earthquake just to put things in
perspective eight and a half thousand
schools were either destroyed or badly
damaged in the earthquake and to date
only between two and a half and three
thousand have been rebuilt all hands is
a very different organization they are
full of mostly young people who have
boundless energy and enthusiasm and I
was incredibly impressed
what they are doing they aren&#39;t disaster
tourists they work incredibly hard and
selflessly to make things a bit better
for such a noble people I was equally
humbled by them although I had a totally
different experience so what about in
Malaysia well I got back to the UK in
June and quickly started to look at
where to go next by chance I saw a
posting on Facebook about the VIP
fellowship scheme volunteering from
international professionals this is a
scheme that is funded by the Ministry of
Finance to improve the social wealthy
welfare and well-being of various
communities throughout the country it&#39;s
the third year of the scheme and each
year they choose ten projects and select
30 international professionals and 20
local people to run I was immediately
drawn to the concept it wasn&#39;t put off
by a very detailed application form and
eventually I offer Skype interview I got
the news that I&#39;d been selected and
seven weeks ago I landed in KL so let me
tell you about positive living community
the organization the fibers so here are
helping it&#39;s a home that caters for a
chart for men with HIV and AIDS and
other addictions some of whom are also
disabled and all the Hera&#39;s based in
battle array an hour out of KL PLC is
run by an incredible man
Alex Erica who for 20 years has been
champing the cause these men are
selflessly devoting every waking minute
to them there are 60 residents in four
homes ranging from those who are bit
bedridden and have to be helped with
every aspect of their lives and probably
will never leave to those who can do
some work but are not ready to deal with
life outside in the real world and there
are some who who have jobs outside the
community and are preparing to leave
they also take in Burmese refugees for
the UN they have small farm and some
livestock and produce me psycho cheeky
however they are in a mess I badly need
some help to sort things out Alex freely
admits that management isn&#39;t as strong
quite they rely entirely on donations
and some external funding and our remit
is to put in place systems to provide
stable management devise strong and
sustainable revenue streams and provide
the residents with therapies and a
structure to their lives that has been
missing all in for months a tall order
but one that the five of us have
embraced that will do whatever we can to
achieve it and when you spend time with
these men even those who stores are
heart-rending you can see a glimmer of
light in their eyes and it is up to us
to try and give them a reason to feel
positive about their lives we have
already had two very successful days
clearing up the site if brave people
volunteering to help us and we have
shifted numerous skips and the
enthusiasm amongst the residents has
been palpable
Suren they&#39;re still working away we are
also hoping to construct a new building
that will allow the residents to have
some where they can learn new skills and
have a proper recreation area and where
meetings can be held so too
very badly paraphrase are well known
live from Star Wars we only have nine
weeks left to save the community who
will come and help us volunteers unpaid
staff for superheroes
I think it&#39;s unpaid superheroes what do
you say thank you
you
