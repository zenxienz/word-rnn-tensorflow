I don&#39;t all about fear when I was
growing up you could have described me
as a mask or a shy I was timid I was
quiet I didn&#39;t want to draw attention to
myself and partly that&#39;s my character
and I was an only child born into two
parents who not me did but they were
terribly risk-averse the my dad was a
bank manager the goodness base and
that&#39;s my back when banking the safe I
think more captain Mallory well the
board for today and I got to stay that
shy baths
I tried tap-dancing once and the teacher
shouted at me and I ran out in floods of
tears never to return again and nobody
made me
and it&#39;s probably no surprise to hear
that I was buried at school I was taught
my NH lives over way I have these really
thick rimmed glasses we had back in the
80s and it really isn&#39;t really
imaginative
I like all cool things like four-eyes
fatty and because my sign name is leg
now of course they didn&#39;t call me leg
knee did they they caught me maybe and I
think when you in that sort of situation
the world can be really really scared
when you&#39;re a child you&#39;re a mouse
you&#39;re quiet and you want to get on but
there&#39;s no guidebook is there the
nothing that tells you how to behave how
to react on how to get on in life and as
a teenager I started about the coping
strategies and some work and some didn&#39;t
it&#39;s probably no surprise together I was
pretty studious I did reasonably well at
school and you know when you go to
college you have to stand up and give a
presentation to give a talk and stand up
in front of people and that can be
really scary when you&#39;re a mouse and one
of the things that worked for me was
preparing really really well and you may
be able to tell it&#39;s a strategy
worked quite well today and then there&#39;s
always distractions that don&#39;t work so I
love that the strategies like you know
when I had to do a presentation or had
to do something else I wouldn&#39;t turn the
lights much fear I would you know how to
sleep this night upset stomach and the
occasional crying the toilet you know
anyone else been there yeah I&#39;m glad
about the only work and that&#39;s a
strategy that continues not deserve me
so well today as well the thing is when
you are mouth especially when you&#39;re
young it can be really really painful
you know I wanted to make something for
myself I wanted to travel I wanted to
achieve big things but it&#39;s so easy to
put them on the back burner and not tell
anyone
now there is a time I am going to share
with you it is a little bit embarrassing
when I was 18 I fancied this boys at
work and I thought I really want to ask
you about how do I do it and I could
find it in one of my friends and she
said I&#39;m gonna tell him unless you ask
him out
how dare she but I did but I did in the
mouth way so I ran up to him after work
one day popped a note in his pocket and
ran away before he could say anything to
me I think when you immerse you you know
you want to certainly for me anyway I
thought my work was gonna speak for
itself I thought I could do a good job I
thought that I could hide under the
radar I thought I could hide in a home
and I thought everything was going to be
okay
and in the intervening years a lot of
what I did that took me out of my
comfort zone was because I was forced to
do so rather than because it rather than
it coming actually for myself so there I
was one day doing pretty well work I
thought I thought my wife was speaking
for itself I thought I was getting all
okay and then one day my boss said to me
okay I wish you&#39;d speak out for the
seemingly innocent comment from somebody
I respected but it made me think you
know because he&#39;s so painful if you
don&#39;t do things and I realized it wasn&#39;t
just about speaking up in meetings I
needed to show up more in the world
I needed to be seen I needed to be heard
and it was time to dismount starts
squeaking that little bit louder and I
think whenever you want to make any
change in your life it can be really
hard to do it by yourself
you know these big ideas big things you
want to achieve but it lets you get
support to do it you were less likely to
actually go ahead and take any action so
I did what a lot of people do that sort
of situation is I got myself a life
coach or at least when people do it now
and I started working with this lady and
we started to look at my strengths the
things that I was good like who would
have thought the mouse was good at
something I started to look at what is
my purpose what is my passion what is my
vision what are my goals or my dreams
what I want to achieve and I think the
thing is when you start articulating
things out loud you&#39;re more likely to
achieve and when you&#39;ve got other people
supporting you each step of the way and
then I thought my life is coaching that
I could do this
why couldn&#39;t I help people who were also
you know they throw a bit like me they
had these big dreams these big visions
but thought I can&#39;t do it I&#39;m not going
to do it and in 10 short months and that
conversation of my boss - with within
that ten months I set up my own business
and I try
to the couch so I did but there&#39;s a huge
difference between trainees and coach
and having a certificate whispering I&#39;m
a coach where nobody hears you two
actually running a successful business
isn&#39;t huge difference and you know in
those early days I had some really lucky
breaks but the harsh reality is you have
to be able to afford to live the harsh
reality is you have to be able to pay
the bills and you know running a
business isn&#39;t something that comes
naturally to many people like myself who
came from the corporate watch so I
thought I&#39;m not going to be deterred by
this how can I learn the secrets to run
a successful business and back at the
time most who may not be masters and I
had the opportunity to spend some time
as a really successful coaches I learned
their secrets I interviewed the West
bedtime with them I started to put what
I was learning into place in my own
business and I was getting really great
results
I thought well I can&#39;t keep this to
myself can i I need to share it with
people so I played to one of my
strengths and I decided to write a book
about it I do and I did so what did I
learn from these coaches well there was
a main reader key things like that the
first thing I learned is the find a role
model find somebody who does what you
want to do really really well and learn
from they may be a coach they make your
mentor or someone who just aspire to
maybe celebrity or somebody think I&#39;d
like to be a little bit more like that
but then look at how you can put it
authentically into your business so
you&#39;re still new I looked at the
importance of mine 7 belief when it
comes to success and even if you don&#39;t
have confidence in spades right now it&#39;s
something that can be developed it&#39;s
something you learn over time you can
put into place
and the more you do something the more
it will become a natural strength you
know the thing that you may have felt
really fearfully you
you stretch your comfort zone you do
that a little bit more and he suddenly
realized you&#39;re ready to go and do it
probably bit like standing up here today
so I would say that I wasn&#39;t the only
person to face fear I wasn&#39;t the only
person to feel like before to feel like
an imposter to feel that one day I was
going to be found out a lot of people
feel like that herd of thought and one
of the things I&#39;m what am i interviewing
said to me she said always trust you
come across better than you think and
those people you protect in high regard
we put on a pedestal they have the same
squishing incisors at rest of us there&#39;s
something that&#39;s already always that
with me and I think there&#39;s two phrases
that can be can encapsulate everything I
learn as Mikey said just do it and
there&#39;s a latex and jacket set
feel the fear and do it anyway now I
must admit when I was writing that
through 92 people fear I did I went
three three months of procrastination
procrastination thinking Who am I to
like boo what do people don&#39;t like it
what if it doesn&#39;t sell what if I get
bad reviews all of those things were
going through my life but don&#39;t I have
these endemic coaches who were waiting
for me to publish it and I knew that I
had to do it and thank goodness I think
you know in a way I was hiding behind
their words in terms of the book because
I was sharing their knowledge and
expertise but actually writing just gave
me that courage to step up and become
more visible and I think that is one of
the biggest things either and there are
times when you do have to fake it till
you make it
sometimes you have to act as if and
sometimes you just have to do crazy
thing and studying and I ask myself
questions like what would life look like
it
what would life look like my lived life
to the full what would life look like I
didn&#39;t care what other people thought
well I was just I was just about to find
out
the following year the mouse embarked on
a project called a year to live a life
started to face some of my personal
fears I thought in for a penny in for a
pound right let us go for it and I
signed up to a parachute jump I went
skiing for the first time I signed up
for charging trek to machu picchu and i
became viable constructor just a few
minor things - but it didn&#39;t come
without their troubles when I was in
Peru I ended up in hospital with
altitude sickness when I did my first
speed trip I didn&#39;t know my to wipeout
when had bruises all the way down the
left side of my body and just imagine me
going up in the plane shaking I&#39;m
petrified of heights my way and I was
really really scared and when they asked
who wants to be at the plane first if I
make me me anything so just imagine me
now we&#39;re shutting the plane get it
right to the end
tightly very tightly attached to my
instructor by the way and I&#39;m there and
I&#39;m ready to go and I&#39;m looking out into
the vast expanse that&#39;s going on to me
oh my god I&#39;m so scared
Who am I to be doing this Who am I to be
jumping up this aeroplane and I thought
back to that child hiding behind have
others gasp I thought back to that child
who was balut
and with that jumped and that courage
started to turn into exhilaration as I
jumped out that plane and I screamed
finally the masses murmuring but I was
reminded that year why I did
to the project my dad was diagnosed with
cancer for the second time and one day
he whispered to me
Taron a might not have a year that&#39;s
just such a realization that life can be
short
none of us know what&#39;s around the corner
and our fears really can simply become
an inconvenience around a very block now
you might think my story ends there it
doesn&#39;t not quite anyway you know I&#39;ve
learned that when it comes to fear when
the push to doing something is stronger
the more likely you are to do something
the more likely you are to stretch your
comfort zone and do those things that
scare you
and also just write to my name books
anymore
I was helping other people with theirs
because I know what it&#39;s like to want to
be seen and want to be heard having a
really important message and not be sure
how to get a message out there I think
we&#39;ve all been through something in life
whether it&#39;s trauma pain difficulties or
so much in life and maybe you want to
share that message to make it make a
bigger difference in the world
to help other people or reach more
people who you know benefit in your
message and who knows you might need
somebody to help
I believe that fear doesn&#39;t exist
without courage and courage doesn&#39;t
exist without fear and when when you&#39;re
when you overcome that that fear and
turning into courage you could change
yours and other people&#39;s lives forever
now I&#39;m no longer jumping up playing and
walking on hot coals I&#39;m still doing
things that scared me as you can imagine
like standing up in front of you here
today because it does and one of my
coping strategies was to prepare really
really well and I was wide awake at 3
o&#39;clock this morning going through my
door with as you can imagine I think we
will feel that fear don&#39;t we and we have
that choice whether to turn it into
courage and you never know what might
happen when you
you know that boy that I mentioned that
I asked out when I was 18 he did go on
to become my husband and my dad never
did have that year but knowing that he&#39;s
looking at me championing me every step
of the way
it&#39;s one of the things that keeps me
going and some people have asked me
what&#39;s happened to the mouse well you
can probably tell she&#39;s still here I
just now make a decision you did time to
hide asleep or is it time to raw
