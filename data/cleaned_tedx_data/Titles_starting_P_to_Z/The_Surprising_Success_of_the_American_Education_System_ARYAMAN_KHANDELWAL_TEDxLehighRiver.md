every time I walk into a dinner at a
family friend&#39;s house I walk in scared
my parents tell me this one is going to
be different but I know better sure
they&#39;ll start by talking about politics
or sports or some other adult topic but
the discussion always comes back to one
thing they&#39;re kids
us and our education there&#39;s always
frequent comparisons between the lagging
us students and those of other countries
like China Japan Korea and Finland no
one agrees on anything regarding public
education except for one supposed fact
the American public education system is
broken but is it really you know it&#39;s an
interesting phenomenon according to a
recent Gallup poll only 29 percent of
American adults expressed confidence in
the American education system with many
citing teaching towards testing as a
major reason for their concern it was a
record low but surprisingly when
galloped asked adults to rate their own
child school an overwhelming 75 percent
said that they positively viewed the
quality of their own child&#39;s education
29 percent for America&#39;s education but
75 percent for their own child
how could this happen this gap suggests
that the news media and political
discourse have played a greater role in
forming our perceptions of public
education rather than our own
first-person experiences but you hear it
all the time
year after year American students lag
behind their international counterparts
in key academic benchmarks among the 34
countries in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development the
United States
27th in mathematics 20th in science and
17th in reading not particularly
inspiring numbers especially when
compared to some of the other countries
that were measured but you see that
itself is the problem numbers we gauge
the health of our education system based
on numbers from testing the program for
international student assessment or Pisa
is the International standardized exam
that these rankings are based on and
it&#39;s known to only focus on specific
benchmark tasks but is there a test that
can measure the passion a student brings
to his or her ideas or a score that
ranked students based on their
leadership potential or an index that
can gauge the creativity with which a
student approaches a problem these are
the soft skills that the American
education system excels at one that no
benchmark can measure the American
education system isn&#39;t broken it&#39;s
actually working pretty well a few years
ago my cousin from India came to visit
my family in the States
now her summer break starts much earlier
than mine so she came while I was still
in school now she decided that she
wanted to come to my school and sit in
on my classes rather than just sit
around board all day yeah she was that
much of a nerd now she goes to one of
the most rigorous high schools in the
United States ystem but when she came
home from school that day she just
couldn&#39;t stop gushing about how great
her day had been she loved how involved
the teachers were at making sure
students understood the concepts they
were being taught how interesting the
textbooks made every subject and all the
different activities the school had to
offer
she was just dying to go back to school
the next day
unfortunately she couldn&#39;t but that
experience was so influential that she
eventually decided to come to university
in the United States and she now attends
Georgia Tech using a standardized test
as a metric for the health of our
education system in a time where
education itself is trying to adapt to
become more creative and less test
centric seems rather counterproductive
and rightfully so Albert Einstein once
said if you judge a fish by its ability
to climb a tree it&#39;ll live its entire
life thinking it&#39;s stupid if we judge
our education system on its ability to
create students who can do well on tests
will always consider it to be broken
because our schools and our teachers
know that there&#39;s a better way to teach
our school system is more like this fish
sure it can climb trees but is that
really what we want it to be doing our
schools and teachers are working hard to
inspire and empower students because
that&#39;s what the future will require not
just making them memorize random facts
that could just as easily come from
Google I&#39;ve seen three things our
schools are working really hard on to
prepare students for their futures
things that that no benchmark can
measure collaboration application an
independent study our schools and
teachers recognize that in the real
world
collaboration often Trump&#39;s competition
because the real world forces people to
work together even if they really don&#39;t
want to at the real world the only way
to make true change happen is with
people working together in fact group
projects and projects requiring
discussion and debate were the two areas
where students reported the greatest
engagement in their curriculums schools
also recognized that to make a topic
interesting and valuable for stood
real-world applications must be taught
because pure knowledge is most
beneficial when students understand
where it&#39;s used in the real world
knowing applications inspire students to
think deeper and truly understand the
topics they&#39;re being taught most
importantly the job of education is to
teach students how to learn and enabling
them to apply that in their own way to
their own projects independent study
allows students to use their creativity
for the greater good of society on
real-world topics and to tie all three
of these together students need advice
and guidance in the form of mentorship
something that teachers provide really
really well by dedicating hours after
school before school during lunches and
during free periods to make sure that
students understand what&#39;s being taught
one of my teachers is here today and I
know she&#39;s definitely done that for me
you know but at this point many of my
fellow students in the audience will
balk and say you know there are all
these places where schools don&#39;t teach
applications or micromanage instead of
allowing for independent thought or for
students to compete
rather than collaborate but the fact
remains that sometimes these are
important parts of Education as well and
we have a long way to go before
creativity is implemented in every
aspect of our classroom but if we don&#39;t
recognize the positives eventually we&#39;ll
forget them a national policy will
eliminate them because no one&#39;s talking
about what they do and how they help our
students when we really should be
strengthening them I&#39;ve seen these
methods in my own school in my 10th
grade human geography class our final
project was to note a problem addressed
by the current global order and come up
with the practical solution to help
address the issue my passion had always
been to help out in any way that I could
in my country of birth in
yeah after hours and hours of pouring
through UN papers reading government
reports and listening to people&#39;s
stories I decided that health care spoke
the most to me especially when people in
rural areas couldn&#39;t access it I ended
up not only presenting my research in
class but creating a solution that could
actually be used in the real world I was
able to test my system
get to greater in the field and face
that it faced the challenges it brought
up head-on through my school I was able
to reach out to Penn State for funding
doctors at nonprofits in India and
developers to help me work on the app
all examples of collaboration the
assignment itself encouraged me to think
of practical applications for the
concepts we had learned in school and it
also required me to work on my own
tackle problems my own way through my
own creativity through independent study
at each level of the process my school
enabled me to succeed not by providing
me with everything I needed but by
enabling me to seek it out for myself
and apply it now let me be clear the
United States public education system
does still face very significant
problems chief among those being
inequity in levels of schooling
different schools can provide most
schools just don&#39;t have the resources to
establish high tech labs or a sponsor
expensive field trips mine certainly
didn&#39;t but still schools are doing their
absolute best to incorporate these soft
skills where they matter most right in
the classroom and we should acknowledge
that they do the biggest consequence of
our overwhelmingly negative perception
of public education is that we try to
fix it in ways that get rid of what made
it so great to begin with we try to add
more tests to see how the school system
is doing
more standardization and we give
teachers more things to cover in a year
we try to model our system on those of
other countries that play to different
strengths than ours moving backwards
when we should be moving forward now
I&#39;ve talked a whole lot about
theoretical ways education has changed
but let me just make it real I just
learned to drive and I don&#39;t know about
all of you but the first time I was
supposed to drive I sat down in the
driver&#39;s seat put my hands on the wheel
adjusted the mirrors a little bit and
then immediately got back out cuz I just
knew I was gonna crash I was terrified
now imagine if we went back to teaching
math science social studies or history
if we started teaching we went back to
teaching driving the way we used to
teach all these core subjects class
let&#39;s open up to page 45 of the driver&#39;s
manual and begin reading now who can
tell me where the gear shift is located
it&#39;s part of benchmark three point three
so you should really know it good job
your final exam is gonna be on Monday
and here&#39;s your study guide if you pass
with more than a 75% you&#39;ll be free to
drive on the road with no restrictions
good luck and instantly we&#39;ve just
doubled the size of the airbag industry
there&#39;s a reason why students have to
practice driving for 65 hours before
they&#39;re even eligible to get their
juniors license after which they
practice for an entire year before they
get their real license now I&#39;m not
saying that the theory behind driving
isn&#39;t important that&#39;s why we still have
Theory tests but with driving we
recognize that just theory isn&#39;t enough
first students work with peers and
instructors and parents to understand
the ins and outs of driving
collaboration then they practice with a
parent on the real road for at least 65
hours application
then finally they have an entire year
under a juniors license to understand
their own personal driving style
independent study now we just have to
remember that this method works and we
should use it in our schools too so
let&#39;s celebrate this let&#39;s recognize the
weaknesses of our education system but
let&#39;s also celebrate their strengths the
incredible dedication they inspire in
teachers the environment they create for
students to succeed and the students
themselves that they empower to be great
in our world thank you
