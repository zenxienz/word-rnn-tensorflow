in the ancient times a king had about
your place in the roadway and he hid
himself to see if anyone would remove
the huge dog out of the way some of the
Kings best deist men and wisest men pass
through and just walked around yet some
even blame ticking loudly for not
hearing the words of this big rocks but
none they take a single effort to move
the rock aside but there came a peasant
with a load of vegetables as he arrived
near the rock he put his load down and
right to move the rock aside after much
pushing and straining he finally
succeeded then when he came back to pick
up his load of vegetables he saw a purse
lying on the place where the boulder was
placed he picked it up and opened it and
do you know what was in that purse yes
you are like gold coins and a letter
from the king indicating that this was
for the person who moved the rock aside
there the peasant lot which many of us
will never understand every obstacle to
resent an opportunity to improve our
condition the difference lies in how we
see it so always remember friends
opportunities are never lost someone
will take the ones you miss Kevin to
every opportunity greetings for everyone
gathered here I&#39;m very delighted to
stand here in front of you all on this
very big stage and speak about the race
is on life is a race you have to be
false to win it and on this race of
lives every moment is
different place where you&#39;ve never been
so be careful on this risk it was not
yourself in a far-off time capture the
woman that is dying every moment in your
life is precious that is precious than
gold diamond platinum everything and
when you&#39;re enjoying these precious
moments try to capture it and when you
do this you can succeed in your life so
I am here to speak about once it&#39;s
precious moment in my life
can you guess what it is slightly sad
ring is an enjoyable woman for almost
everyone right yes and when you enjoy
this precious moment capture it and even
you do this believe me it can cross the
heights cycling is an amazing form of
transportation it gets you from one
place to another quickly without harming
the environment and it&#39;s a terrific
exercise cycling is eco-friendly and
just not waste the non-renewable
resources my parents may spend over a
five thousand every month on their
transportation for the diesel and petrol
but I hardly spent five apiece since
I&#39;ve used a bycicle cycling is the best
way to banish these greenhouse gases
from our mother earth cycling is the
harmless and innovative technologies
these pave the way to change the future
these capture the moment and encapsulate
the future in the history of
transportation I started cycling when I
was five years old and when I launched
it I was actually pretty excited about
it that I learned something new
something different and still now I love
it
so whenever I&#39;m sailing free or bored I
don&#39;t take even a second to realize it&#39;s
time for cycling let&#39;s go I hop onto my
cycle eagerly doing about waiting to
cycle as soon as I get out I might be
discovered
in my locality 2-cycle I roll my hands
in the end like as if I&#39;m a bird flying
in the sky I also try to race with the
other vehicles trying to prove cycle is
the best liquid left but chasing Rubens
and I enjoy that moment so much that I
don&#39;t even realize the time I take more
than a half an hour or an hour and never
realize it until the end comes my mom
standing outside waiting for me near my
house and when I are like that she said
come inside you&#39;ve been out for a long
time but comments I love my cycle no way
that time I just feel as if I just want
to be on my cycle and go through all my
life only on it but that time my mom
makes me realize that I&#39;ve been all for
a long time and I have to go inside but
experience what I get when cycling
is an amazing experience I feel so free
so stress relief my boredom is gonna
enjoy that moment so much if you will
drive it you will love it and was I kept
it in your mind okay so I think here
I&#39;ve shown you of what it is to capture
the moments and this can seize the
future sees is the idea behind the race
is on you need to seize the future to
win this race the secret of success in
life is for a person to be ready for its
opportunities when it comes have you
ever heard of the same the chance favors
only the prepared mind yes when you are
prepared chance will favor that is what
are you prepared for the upcoming
challenges for the future for the
roughness of this race be prepared
others chance with much pavement every
day is a different opportunity to make a
new high
that is why seize the day
put very little trust in tomorrow that
the future is unforeseen and that one
should not leave to chance future but
rather do what one can do today when we
are given an assignment on Friday and to
be submitted on Monday I&#39;m afraid we
meeting let&#39;s do it on Saturday this
tomorrow when we arrive at Saturday we
might think this Sunday let&#39;s do it
tomorrow and when we arrive at sandia
meeting there&#39;s a wood Sunday let&#39;s do
it later then we never do it sitting in
Monday mornings remembering something
and the work is not done
instead we could&#39;ve do it on Friday
itself and free for the next of the days
it is not to completely ignore the
future but rather not to trust that
everything is going to fall into place
in future the future depends on what we
do today so we have to try to do it
today have you ever thought of a moment
that just got away from you or the
moment you think you could have done
something great help someone change
someone&#39;s life changed your life yes
moments like these parts every day
whether it&#39;s helping a friend with a
project on making a commitment these
special moments can impact the rest of
your life that is the future these
capped tiny moments from your life and
helped to seize the future there was an
American telecommunication company which
hosted a TV commercial which says a boy
gets a ticket to a football match
suddenly and when he goes to the match
he receives of football and this is an
opportunity and later on he becomes a
football player which is the future I
know this may be
commercial jr. you but the message which
is sent out is important it is to never
let opportunities to slip away from you
you cannot blame someone for walking
away when you did not do anything to
make them stick thinking before acting
is wisdom but thinking after opting is
regret the moment when you regret
something you think back on its exact
moment
come on your mother would realize with
regrets right yes because we think
without thinking about those regrets how
can we advance into the future but let
us think in this way when we are
thinking about the missed moments maybe
maybe we could have done something great
with waste our time thinking about the
past instead of thinking about the
present and future when we look at it we
can ensure that something is going to
fall into place
only if we said starting goals for
ourselves when we are cycling in the
race of life we need to look I had to
ensure we don&#39;t know and SWAT somewhere
our vehicle does not comes and hits you
or we do not go and - somewhere when we
are looking ahead and cycling and a
vehicle is coming we move aside and this
is the opportunity vision we have
captured and saved ourselves but when we
are looking backward in cycling or when
it comes and it - is you have you miss
your opportunity to save ourselves
instead we we should have looked at it
and saved ourselves we have to look
ahead and when we do this we can give us
as a higher probability of success a
pessimist makes difficulties on his own
opportunities but an optimist makes
opportunities honest own difficulties
look through the world through the
optimistic eye and see a change in your
it is not what happens to you it is what
you know what happens to you
this was coated with a great
here with you always be aware of Chris
Waddle chris bollyn
is an amazing skier who tragically
became palnet capture the moments of his
life by reaching the mountain by
reaching the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro
and skiing from there come on being a
passive skier and clever isn&#39;t it
daunting yes
but Chris wallet did it he reached the
summit and he&#39;s killed from there and
when he does it he&#39;s setting a new
standard for anyone on the wheelchair in
the future maybe an American spot the
inspired Bingham and changed their lives
and he physically challenged person
inspired by Chris Potter can change
their lives make history to be
remembered in future and even anybody
can achieve something is by making sure
that they do anything in their power to
make it happen your actions right now
even though you do know it can impact
the rest of your life that is the future
these actions can be as simple as by
making a threat when we meet someone and
you want to make them our friends we
have to think whether the person is a
good one or a bad one
when we make a bad friend we go on the
wrong side and make wrong goals but when
we make a good friend we go on the right
side and make right goals and when we
make a good friend it can lead to
endless possibilities and these actions
can be as simple as we&#39;re trying to talk
to someone or trying extra hard to get a
good performance academically or a good
performance at litical but the chance
lies here when your performance Academy
code is good you become a scientist
engineer doctor and much more and when
your performance analytically is good
you become a good sports person see
where you are good at and choose that
part
life is not anything but an opportunity
for something take the opportunity
capture the moments
seize the future
this race the moments of happiness take
us by surprise
it is not VC&#39;s that it is that they
seize us every time I see other ones on
the bycicle
I am no longer despair for the future of
human race cycling is life with volume
turned up life is like a riding a
bicycle to keep the balance you must
keep moving
and when you&#39;re siting in the race of
life and we get tired we slow down
because we know if we stop we will for
the same way in this race when we stop
before down from the higher level to the
no.1 death and others will overtake us
and this race is so tough that others
may push you to fall down but we need to
be concentrated on this race to win it
to be concentrated on this race take it
like a journey a journey but you need to
capture as many as moments from your
life and help to change your future when
we are on a journey and you want to
capture the memory facility of sunset
Thompson and some other tourists have
done it before you you cannot go and
fight with them I have eugenics instead
you can go and capture the beautiful
scenery of sunrise do something
different the same way in life when we
want to invent something discover
something and someone else have done it
before you you cannot go and leave them
a fight with them I was going to do it
why have you done it instead we can do
something different or we have to be
fast to be first take it like a journey
when you&#39;re enjoying it
try to seize it and remember there is a
time for risky love there is a time for
extra matron guest Jose there is a time
to pour out your affections on the one
you love or on the thing you love and
when the time groups seize it
don&#39;t miss it so that it can be remember
in future so do you wanna taste
opportunity yes everybody does want to
taste opportunity but opportunity it has
this light habit of living in by the
backdoor and always comes disgust in the
form of misfortune our temporary
different there is when many of us fail
to taste it but if you want to taste it
we need to capture the moments so that
we can ensure when the opportunity is
coming like I&#39;ve done here I&#39;ve captured
the moment on this TEDx stage by giving
a TEDx talk I&#39;ve done mine now it&#39;s time
for you to do yours
and remember through readings which you
cannot recover in life it&#39;s the moment
after it is past the world after it is
set and the time after it is wasted so
put the phone between your legs
cycle for a healthy and happy life and
to seize the future thank you
