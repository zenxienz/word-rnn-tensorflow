for any of you that have seen the movie
The Matrix you may remember a quote from
agent Smith who said human beings are a
disease a cancer of this planet
you&#39;re a plague but it doesn&#39;t have to
be that way we are also capable of great
good in this world and if we want to
stay on this planet longer than the
hundred years that Stephen Hawking has
predicted we have left we need to change
the dynamic and change the way that we
operate on this planet one of the
biggest impacts that we&#39;ve had
particularly since the Industrial
Revolution is climate change and for
those of us here in Germany we see this
every day in terms of the receding of
the glaciers that we see so dramatically
in the Merida glass at the same time
deforestation is one of the biggest
drivers of emissions that cause climate
change and has a huge impact on local
communities and the environment and the
products that we buy every day from
agricultural products to the coltan and
our cellphones
can have a huge impact on those
environments as well local communities
are often disadvantaged in this whole
equation the the benefits and the values
are often exported while costs are
localized in fact a recent publication
from a group called true cost estimates
that none of the world&#39;s top region
sectors would be profitable if we took
these costs into account so if you think
about beef in Latin America for example
or coal in China if you took into
account the impact that that has on
water on soil on local communities not
one of them would be profitable in
today&#39;s dynamic we have to change that
now who is it then that is paying that
cost if it&#39;s not the companies and this
is not on their balance sheets where
does this come from it comes from all of
us we pay in terms of the cost of the
impact of oil spills we pay in terms of
the response to increasing hurricanes we
also pay in terms of migration in fact
in 2007 the worst drought
recorded history began in Syria they
lasted three years and because of the
impacts on the local environment about
1.5 million people moved to the cities
so when the conflict began in Syria it
was suddenly compounded by the fact that
you had additional problems in terms of
resourcing agriculture so that drove
part of the migration that we saw from
that conflict so we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got to do
something different a few quotes might
show us the way
societal challenges are core element in
the search for competitive advantage and
we need better solutions to solve global
challenges and we put this at the core
of our strategy now these are not quotes
coming from Environmental Defense Fund
or any other environmental organization
they are in fact quotes from the 2016
survey of global CEOs so there are
companies waking up to the fact that if
you change this dynamic if instead of
externalizing those costs you take them
into account from the beginning we can
start to change the whole dynamic of
business most companies think about this
kind of an impact as an afterthought
they start from addressing risk and
compliance they get more efficient they
grow and ultimately they might decide oh
I should probably give something back
I&#39;ll do some sort of corporate social
responsibility effort but we&#39;re starting
to see companies start from the other
end and say I&#39;m going to build into my
core business value that I as a company
I&#39;m going to act in a more responsible
manner unfortunately the number of
companies that do that is still quite
limited we need to push we need to push
more companies in a better direction to
have a better impact on this planet one
way that&#39;s done is through certification
now I&#39;m sure many of you in this room
have purchased Fairtrade coffee or
organic cocoa and for those premium
commodities we&#39;re beginning to see a
huge change you can see a growing
percentage of certification the problem
is you probably aren&#39;t buying certified
soy or sugar it&#39;s very difficult many of
these products are built into things
that you buy you don&#39;t even know
laughs away in them it&#39;s hard to then
seek out I&#39;m going to purchase something
which is certified at the same time
there&#39;s a huge growing middle class
population in countries like China and
India and that&#39;s a very good thing but
it means that the number of people on
this planet demanding these commodities
continues to grow and will continue to
have an impact so what we really need to
do is scale this up we need bigger
levers we need ways to push more effort
in the right direction and that can come
in a number of different forms in one
example for example a tea now nevermind
what that means essentially it&#39;s trying
to get illegal timber out of Europe now
illegal timber is one of the major
causes of deforestation because a lot of
the countries where this timber is
produced lack the capacity to enforce
their own laws that drives deforestation
that timber comes into Europe and we
continue to be a part of the cycle
ourselves so Europe has put into place a
strategy where they&#39;re trying to remove
illegal timber from the supply chain so
if we think bigger we think about the
policy and trade leaders that we can use
we can drive a change much faster than
from an individual choice although that
choice is important at the same time we
can also go to the source these
commodities are produced somewhere if we
go and look at the landscapes in which
they&#39;re produced we can also try to
scale up the efforts toward
sustainability picture a landscape if
you can in any country in this world
that produces some of our major
commodities you&#39;ll find a number of
different uses and needs throughout that
community if you think about an
agricultural producer or a company which
is buying cocoa in Ghana for example
their whole supply chain is currently at
risk they are literally looking at a
future where they may not be able to
supply cocoa because of the impact of
climate change on these landscapes
because of the impact of the trade-offs
with other uses in that landscape so
they really need to maintain their
supply and to do that they need to be
able to better
oh shit and cooperate with others in
that landscape governments are the same
they have a need to show progress and an
economic development to local
communities but to do that in a way that
doesn&#39;t negatively impact those
communities in their environment even a
mining company who you might think of as
a as a negative actor in this landscape
often enters a place for a very long
time 20 to 100 years on average and they
need to maintain relationships with
communities in the government so they
also need a way for better cooperation
and coordination so that their efforts
and their impacts don&#39;t have negative
impacts and vice-versa so fundamentally
what we need to do is create mechanisms
to scale up how we assess these
landscapes and how we drive change if
you take a look at this example we have
two maps B is a carbon density map
essentially the red areas are where you
have really carbon dense forests healthy
for us native forests on the a side
we&#39;re looking at land use you can see
where there are protected areas
indigenous communities logging and fuel
oil concessions they all have different
needs within this landscape now by
mapping these together we can identify
areas of threat so where do we see an
expansion of logging concessions into
areas that need to be protected that are
important for biodiversity or for
climate change of protecting those
forests so we need a means to measure
and monitor this and to drive more
cooperation amongst actors in that
landscape so that this planning can be
done in a way that drives better
outcomes and the challenge in many cases
is a lack of capacity these countries
are struggling to maintain development
let alone be able to enforce this sort
of land-use plan or in many cases even
come up with it so again companies can
play a really important role now this is
a very small segment of companies who
have made commitments many of them to
remove deforestation from their supply
chains others to fur invite other
environmental or social commitments
but for them to make good on those
commitments they need to know where
their products are coming from and what
the impact is on those landscapes so we
need to provide them tools for doing so
this is just one example of a way of
displaying data now imagine if we were
to provide a framework that was able to
measure and monitor a number of key
sustainability indicators at scale
deforestation water quality and
management soil fertility all these
things which together help create a more
resilient and sustainable landscape if
you map them on the outside here with
unsustainable practices and and outcomes
in the middle and sustainable ones at
the outside we want to see a particular
landscape expanding over time and
improving their efforts so with tools
like this and measurement opportunities
that allow us to really assess what&#39;s
happening at a large scale in these
landscapes we can start to drive change
but the best tool that you have is
worthless unless you have a reason to
use it I can have 20 pairs of skis in my
closet but if I don&#39;t have a reason to
go outside because there&#39;s no snow I&#39;m
not going to use them the same here we
need to drive incentives to actually
move progress in these landscapes so
those incentives can come in a number of
different forms the first option is
sourcing commitments so those companies
that we saw earlier have made
commitments to say I&#39;m going to have a
better impact if we can link up
landscapes that are demonstrating
progress and addressing those issues
with companies who are making those
public commitments we can drive the
incentive those cut those landscapes
have an incentive to improve because it
will help them with market access of
their commodities and the companies can
make good on those commitments
now of course consumer pressure is also
really important there and is driven a
lot of those commitments so there is
certainly a role for the individual
another key way to drive incentives is
to try to drive finance to places where
we&#39;re seeing better outcomes there&#39;s a
range of actors who are quite relevant
there from multilateral development
development finance institutions impact
investors they&#39;ve all said I&#39;m going to
try to do better things with my money
but they as well need a way to actually
demonstrate what that impact is and try
to drive finance to those places again
by sort of creating these mechanisms for
assessing progress and then tying them
to finance that perhaps for example
offers either preferential or additional
finance to landscapes demonstrating
progress we could start to change that
whole dynamic a third option is really
looking at at-risk companies as we
mentioned earlier have a risk of really
impacting their supply chains not being
able to procure the commodities that
they need in the landscape themselves
they also have the risk of other actors
impacting their own investments and
activities again if we can link these
types of frameworks to assess what&#39;s
happening in a landscape to improving
the ability to manage and mitigate risk
we can change the way that companies are
able to price that risk for many of them
if you remember back to the fact that
that no big region or sector would be
profitable if they included these costs
in their balance sheet that what the
interesting thing that we find is that
if they actually address those things
from the beginning if they say I&#39;m going
to ensure that I am managing this risk
and addressing it they can actually
reduce their cost and turn something
from a cost to a benefit those companies
are finding that it builds their brand
that it helps in fact reduce the costs
of reacting to impacts after the fact so
by building that into the beginning and
they&#39;re in their comprehensive business
value they can actually drive better
change and a better brand and increase
their bottom line so fundamentally what
we need to do is make it more cost
effective to act better we need to make
it class we&#39;re to have a negative impact
and by doing that we can turn the whole
dynamic on its head I&#39;m not talking
about revolution I&#39;m not talking about
offending the market system I&#39;m talking
about using the
power of those markets to drive the
change that we want to see thank you
