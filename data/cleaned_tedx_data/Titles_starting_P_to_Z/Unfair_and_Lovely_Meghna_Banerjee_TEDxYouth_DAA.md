I remember being 8 years old coming home
from the poor one day trying to scrub
off my time as you would with dirt I
knew that bear was better turmeric makes
the skin lighter swimming happens close
to sunset don&#39;t play outside for too
long and although most people want to be
golden brown they don&#39;t want to be my
brows I don&#39;t think I ever innately
classified fairness as a priority for me
but my environment was trying to
convince me another life a quick Google
search will show you that the beautiful
and fair go hand in hand it&#39;s because
the inclusive all King tones are
beautiful rhetoric doesn&#39;t quite match
the reality of skin tones on conserve
Hollywood for example oftentimes
Hollywood directors are criticized for
not portrayed diversity and then
Hollywood directors do show characters
of diverse backgrounds they shamelessly
off for lights in actors think of
Laurence Olivier a white actor who was
nominated for an Oscar for his role as a
fellow from Warren or Christian Bale
another white actor who played Moses of
Middle Eastern descent or even blue-eyed
white actress Emma Stone who played
Allison and Aloha who was supposed to be
a quarter Chinese and a quarter Hawaiian
donut neither of those two things and
when a doctor an individual is
recognized in the public sphere they&#39;re
whitewashed think Rihanna on the cover
of Hope or Kerry Washington on the cover
of inside magazine or Haley berry on the
cover of Harper&#39;s Bazaar but most
shockingly when a dark-skinned
individual is criticized they are
criticized for who they are or for the
quality of the work that they do but
rather for the shade of their skin in
the 2014 Miss America pageant when
Indian American Nina double
the title there was almost shocking
levels of criticism people claim that
had the contest taking place in India
she would have never won simply this
issue is too dark-skinned
the differential treatment of people
based on the skin color is nuanced
perhaps even subtle but no less damaging
Villanova researchers studied over
12,000 cases of women in prison in North
Carolina and found that light-skinned
individuals received more lenient
sentences and served less deal time than
their darker skin counterparts moreover
a University of Georgia study shows that
when applying for jobs light-skinned
african-american males have a distinct
advantage over dark-skinned
african-american males a light-skinned
african-american male with just a
bachelor&#39;s degree and typical work
experience will be preferred over
dark-skinned african-american males with
an MBA and previous managerial positions
this is simply because employers believe
that the light-skinned individual has a
higher capacity and that they appear
less menacing than the dark skinned
individual Indian matrimonial ads are
nothing if not a study of the colorism
and the prejudice that exists in the
Indian middle class 90 out of a hundred
ads will stay fair very fair or
extremely fair skinned as a prerequisite
for a woman to be considered as
beautiful let&#39;s read one out Indian
parents invite alliance for handsome
athletic extremely fair son 31 years old
61 and just completed master&#39;s degree in
Virginia Tech master&#39;s degree Carnegie
Mellon University in computer science
joining repeated software company in
Washington DC and its 31 year old
extremely fair and handsome boy is
looking for a cultured beautiful plan
fair educated girl caste no bar
respond with detail and photo by
so let&#39;s get this straight cast is no
more but apparently fairness is and it
is very unlikely that fairly refers to
the arcane meaning of beautiful
considering beautiful was already
mentioned once so basically if you&#39;re
dark-skinned you&#39;re more likely to serve
a longer prison sentence but less likely
to find a job and you&#39;re going to have
to need some grossly unfair check boxes
when trying to find love so what does
the unemployed convicted felon
who is also single and dark-skinned do
to boost their self-esteem should they
change the color of their skin should
they change the color of their skin
simply because society believes that
only fair is lovely cue the fairness
cream industry the fairness cream
industry promotes the belief that in
order to be successful and beautiful you
must be fair and guarantees it with
their multivitamin creams that provide
double-action whatever that which will
leave you fair and as a result
successful beautiful and employed in
just six weeks just recently I was
watching this advertisement of these
three girls at a college and they&#39;re
stopped by their professor who asks them
what are your aspirations you love the
dark skin go smiles and says well mom I
want to be a professor just like you to
this the professor of life you do
understand that there&#39;s an interview
processes the dark-skinned girl says yes
ma&#39;am I know and I&#39;m completely prepared
for it we then see her go into her room
and Crestor bubble affair lovely if it&#39;s
apparently fairness is the checkbox will
work for injuries the logic of this
advertisement and those like it is that
brand like very love we aren&#39;t
necessarily perpetuating negative body
image for dark-skinned individuals
rather they&#39;re helping them solve their
insecurities but why should a
dark-skinned individual being insecure
to begin with what do they have to be
insecure about you cannot avoid the
fairness cream industry in Asia a
london-based market research firm club
cinema reported that four of ten women
in Taiwan Philippines Malaysia Hong Kong
and Thailand used
screams when the infatuation with
fairies begin in 1978
you nearly relaunched fair and lovely
which subsequently spawned whitening
face cleansers showering gels and here
this most shocking of them all vaginal
losses which claim to lighten the
surrounding skin fair lovely and the
fairies cream industry in general is
huge fair lovely by itself over fifty
percent market share in India alone and
the market in India is worth around 450
million dollars BBC One&#39;s reported that
in South Asia there were more bottles of
fair and lovely being sold in bottles of
coca-cola even Bollywood plays into this
cultural fetish despite the fact that
majority opinions are darkened majority
of Bollywood actors and actresses are
light-skinned some even go through skin
whitening treatments to better appeals
Indian audiences consider actress
Katrina Kaif for Ali&#39;s natural life
deepika padukone for Neutrogena spine
Pharisee or Sonam Kapoor L&#39;Oreal&#39;s white
perfect or pretty Zinta for seven
horrible bleach cream and the most
disconcerting of them all Shahrukh Khan
fair and handsome
it&#39;s shocking because not only to
Shahrukh Khan have a domestic audience
in India but also an international
audience why is this important
consider the fact that four billion
tickets are sold to Bollywood movies
each year vs. 3 billion for Hollywood 2
billion unique individuals will watch
Bollywood films and theaters this year
that&#39;s two billion people being told
that fairness should be an admission the
cosmetics industry has traditionally
relied on creating a confidence gap they
will try to convince their consumers
that they are incomplete within a
particular product or that if they
consume a specific product their
insecurities will vanish Pantene has
recently used this confidence gap
Pantene has try to convince its
consumers specifically women that the
source of their role is in work
placement quality or crafting partners
who don&#39;t do
I share but actually women themselves
and their own lackluster hair if only
women had nicer softer hair life would
be brief
so essentially women are stuff
sabotaging had work love in life because
if they do these issues in life it&#39;s
because they are taking care of their
hair and they can easily do so by buying
a bottle of Pantene the fairness cream
industry relies on society&#39;s insistence
that in order to be beautiful and
successful you must be fair but the
problem is that unlike makeup or fake
tan fairness creams are based on a
system of racial hierarchy which feels
intolerance and cause a serious social
harm and it also amplifies the
imperfections one-season themselves and
it might prompt an individual to use the
product in more than one place on their
body thus leading to the climax of the
stuff despises and it&#39;s a no-brainer and
fairness cream serves as the residue
left over from centuries of colonialism
from India to Japan to Thailand to Korea
at that first glance this might seem
like the Western afflictions of teller
Asia but no one&#39;s ever been told that
because of their dark skin they are
going to serve a longer prison sentence
or that they find difficulty when trying
to look for a job or that they wouldn&#39;t
be able to find love simply because they
were two-time dr. mark circle a trustee
at the British Skin Foundation and a
consultant dermatologist claims that
melanin is produced by melanocytes to
protect the DNA of our skin from sun
damage excessively reducing this
concentration of melanin may increase
our risk of skin cancers people are
literally risking their physical health
to pursue a racist ideals of view
fairness games have serious physical and
psychological effects so young boys and
girls worldwide suffer from the hate
that the ferris cream industry fuels and
their professional and personal success
success is hindered because of the
paris-themed industry so what&#39;s our next
step well it&#39;s not all bad news
countries like I reposed and South
Africa have recently been face creams
claiming that they were high
including skin cancer volcania October
she celebrates beauty in diversity and
shows six different models from all
times
Maldives India Bhutan Sri Lanka Pakistan
and Nepal and most importantly as
colonialism becomes a distant memory and
as racist ideas take a backseat to
ideals of inclusivity and equality the
millennial generation of today refuses
to accept colorism as today&#39;s reality
packs Jones a student of the University
of Texas recently launched a photo
campaign called unfair lovey which
prompted thousands of women worldwide to
share their photos celebrating their
dark-skinned the racist social
mechanisms which push the a girl mean to
try and erase your skin colour are at
work today but in today&#39;s age of
globalization we must celebrate
diversity we must celebrate dark skin
and we must not embark on damaging
pursuits of artificial beauty because at
the end of the day beauty really does
put from the inside and honestly the
eight year old me would have genuinely
and sincerely appreciated situations
