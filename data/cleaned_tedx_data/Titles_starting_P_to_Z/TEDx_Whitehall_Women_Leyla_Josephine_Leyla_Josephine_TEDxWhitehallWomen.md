oh I wasn&#39;t expecting that to start off
my first TED talk but here we are that
didn&#39;t come out in my time right I&#39;m
just joking I&#39;m just doing my job as a
poet is to tell stories I tell my own
personal stories and when working with
others I encourage them and facilitate
them to tell their own I do this because
I believe that stories are magic they
bridge us together they point out our
similarities and make us feel less alone
they help us understand this crazy Begg
madness that we call life I tell my own
personal stories and I usually talk
about taboo subjects subjects that
nobody else wants to touch subjects that
make us feel uncomfortable or awkward
subjects that we keep under our beds or
enter closets just out of sight I do
this because I believe that by sharing
my own personal stories about those
horrible uncomfortable things helps
dilute the shame surrounding them and I
believe shame is one of the most
dangerous emotions that anyone can feel
I wrote a poem in 2014 when I was age 21
about an abortion I had had I was trying
to make sense of this experience I&#39;d had
even years later I released it on the
internet what maybe on reflection wasn&#39;t
the cleverest ideas but I did it anyway
because I wanted to make sense of this
thing that nobody was talking about that
had so much shame wrapped against it
a lot of women have abortions and it&#39;s
medical and it&#39;s a procedure and it&#39;s
easy and I love that I think that&#39;s
amazing
but for me it wasn&#39;t like that it felt
very difficult and very complex it was a
hard decision and it was a shameful
decision for myself and I don&#39;t really
know why because at the same time of
having all these feelings I also felt so
much gratitude that I lived in a country
where I was able to choose I was able to
choose with my own body so I had all of
this stuff going on even years later so
I decided to put it on the page and then
in a way I kind of could look at it and
look at all its complexities and try and
make sense of it now some people ask me
know if it was the rape or a wrong
decision and I don&#39;t think life can be
categorized into rates or wrongs things
are not that simple different paths are
leads out for us at different times and
we must blindly choose and hope for the
best and I think for me it was the best
so the video was shared on Huffington
Post upworthy and the Guardian and it
became viral and I instantly got
messages from women all over the world
coming forward and seeing that they had
the same experience and for a minute we
all feel a little less alone and that to
me was magic but then I went to sleep
naively and thought that that was my job
done like pat on the back done
unfortunately that was not the case
abortion as we all know is a very hot
topic in every single country of the
world and overnight my mbox which was
once a place of love and support and a
newfound community became a police that
was much more sinister it had a lot of
messages that were mean threatening
scary and very unsettling there was a
couple of comments that were quite funny
my favorite being I can&#39;t tell with her
strong Scottish accent if she&#39;s a
brilliant poet or as dumb as a teapot I
really like that one and there&#39;s other
ones that I&#39;m not going to repeat today
because I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re
useful but I bet a lot of women in the
room have been called them as well but
yeah it&#39;s funny when somebody was
talking earlier about trolls under the
bridge
he was like yes trolls under the bridge
that&#39;s what happened to me as well but
time moves on and news changes and I
kept performing the poem I think she was
a she because I believed that hopefully
it was diluting the shame about the
subject that no one was talking about
and I also was kind of doing it as a bit
of a resistance but I don&#39;t do the poem
as much anymore I&#39;m older now I have
other stories to tell
I have other shame to dilute and I see
this happen every day and my work when
I&#39;m working with young people with
adults with additional needs and
presents I see shame being diluted by
talking just talking and I don&#39;t expect
everyone to agree with me on abortion
but I think that we&#39;re now at the point
where we should be able to disagree
without silencing each other and without
shaming each other and I&#39;m going to do
the poem again for you today and I&#39;m
going to do it as a dedication it&#39;s a
dedication to the one and three women in
the UK that have abortions it&#39;s for the
70,000 women worldwide per year that die
from backstreet abortions it&#39;s for our
sisters in Ireland who are just about to
go for the first time and vote to
legalize abortion it&#39;s for the women and
present in El Salvador for having
abortions it&#39;s for the Dominican
Republic and all other countries
throughout the world they only have
abortion if it threatens the women&#39;s
life and finally it&#39;s for all those
women that were faced with the same
choice but decided to become mothers I
salute you I see you I am one of you and
we will stay on the breach and we will
cry and we will grieve and we will laugh
and maybe we&#39;ll disagree but we will not
shy away from this subject because
that&#39;s the thing about shame it tends to
scuttle under the beds when you look
directly at it when you shine light upon
it
I think she was a she I think she was as
she and I think she might have looked
exactly like me
filled cheeks hazel eyes and thick brown
hair that I could have plaited into
dreams at night I would have stuck up
blue stars on her ceiling and told her
they were fireflies to protect her from
the dark I would have told her stories
about her grandfather we could have fed
the Swans at Victoria Park she would
have been like you two with long limbs
and her sarcastic smile and the newest
pair of catch she would have been tough
tougher than I ever was and I would have
taught her all that my mother taught me
and I would have taken her to the
museums and there we could see the bone
dinosaurs and look to them and wonder
about all the things that came before
she was born she could have been born
and I would have made sure there was
space on the wall to measure her height
is she grew I would have made sure I was
a good mother to look up to but I would
have supported her right to choose to
choose a life for herself a path for
herself I am sorry but it came at the
wrong time I am not ashamed I am not
ashamed I&#39;m so sick of keeping these
words contained I am not ashamed I was a
teenage girl with a boy she left between
her thighs that felt very far away Derby
days and Dole don&#39;t do family planning
well I am one and three I am one and
three I had to carve down that cherry
tree that had Richard itself in my blood
and blossoms and my brain of
responsibility I didn&#39;t have the age or
energy to maintain the branches casting
shadows over the rest of my garden the
bark causing my thoughts my heart to
harden I am not ashamed
it&#39;s a hollowness that feels fill a
numbness that feels heavy stop trying to
fit how this feels on an NHS bereavement
brochure already I am allowed to feel it
oh I am allowed to feel I am women now I
am made of steel and she wasn&#39;t a girl
and she wasn&#39;t a boy that&#39;s just the
bullshit you received to keep you out of
Parliament and stuck on maternity leave
don&#39;t you mutter murder on me seventy
thousand pair
year 70,000 per year that&#39;s 192 per day
from coat hangers painkillers the back
alleyway we don&#39;t you mutter murder on
me
worldwide performing abortion like
homework looking for the answers in the
grooves of our palms the bulges and her
belly&#39;s the west burrs and her ears only
to be confronted with question marks
women have been hidden away in the
history books after all its history has
story well this is her story our story
goddamnit this is my story and it will
not be written in pencil and erase with
guilt it will be written and pen and
spoken with courage you will hear it on
the radio on your way to work you will
study it in English you will read the
biter on the bulletin boards next to the
flyer about yoga for babies because I am
not ashamed I am a woman now I will not
be tamed and I have a determination that
this termination will still have a form
of creation it will not be wasted
because this is my body this is my body
and I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t care about
your ignorant views when I become a
mother it will be when I choose thank
you so much for having
[Applause]
