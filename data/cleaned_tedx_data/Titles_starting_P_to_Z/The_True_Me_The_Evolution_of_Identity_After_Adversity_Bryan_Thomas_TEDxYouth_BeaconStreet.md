it may have wind in my very first day a
summer vacation but I was already all
set to start high school and I was set
to take ninth grade by storm
I already begun to fantasize about the
incredible things I would do when I got
there my summer goal was to learn Eddie
Van Halen&#39;s eruption guitar solo so I
could shred it ed ammonia assembly I was
the turned her butt off all summer so I
can make varsity soccer as a freshman
and I was intent on continuing my middle
school long academic streak of earning
high honors the use of the thoughts and
aspirations racing through my head as I
sat joking around some of my closest
friends at midnight June 27 2015 I was
there for an eighth grade graduation
party when suddenly my laughter was
interrupted by a headache worse than
anything out of her film I complained
that my headache was so bad I need to go
upstairs and grab some Advil but I half
way up the stairs i sat down put my head
in my hands and complained that I
couldn&#39;t go any farther only minutes
later I threw up passed out and my
friends Ashley called 9-1-1
three weeks later I woke up from a coma
my earliest memory started being wheeled
through a hospital many of them artists
me opening my eyes for a few seconds
closing them and then nothing during my
first conscious weeks I was covered in
wires had tubes on my nose and throat
had significant cognitive deficits and
memory loss wasn&#39;t still and partially
lying for the rest of my life and I was
fully paralyzed ever left on my spinal
cord I couldn&#39;t sit up couldn&#39;t walk
couldn&#39;t talk couldn&#39;t read and I
couldn&#39;t even write my name on a piece
of paper
my doctor said I&#39;d be lucky to walk
again returning to school was not a win
but an if still not entirely sure what
my diagnosis entailed and being the
monster to turn kid I was that year
after hearing of my new condition of
course the first word that popped in my
head was now it&#39;s gonna be really hard
to make varsity soccer but then again I
was on tons of drugs
my original monitor wants something like
I&#39;m not going to let this incident
affect me at all and I&#39;m going to get
back he&#39;s a ski I used to be but I think
I&#39;m still kind of realized this
experience will transform me for the
rest of my life he won&#39;t make me worse
and it certainly won&#39;t make me better
it is only helping me to embrace and
embody true me after the night of my
original instant I spent a month and a
half looking at Boston Children&#39;s as it
turns out the cause of my incident was a
brain hemorrhage caused by an AVM or
arterial venous malformation which is
the tangle of admiral and poorly formed
blood vessels the night of my hemorrhage
the AVM ruptured and I was rushed to the
hospital
ride holes drilled in my skull and
drains inserted into my brain to relieve
the swelling then surgeons running ty
brain to south of bleeding and remove
the excess blood along I ever and
continue to function did this just in
time since by that point I only hadn&#39;t
estimated 30 minutes left to live
once Ryan had brain had somewhat
recovered I need it got the AVM fully
removed because if I didn&#39;t it was
likely to cause another hemorrhage about
six weeks later I had a long complicated
surgery my surgeons worked for 14
straight hours from 7 in the morning to
9 at night and to ultimately successful
shortly after I was transferred to
Spaulding rehab hospital I remember
spending our it&#39;s reeling to walk with
to sweating physical therapists working
together to just try to hold me up I had
absolutely no move in my left leg so I
would wear this advice called a like I
mobilizer
one physical therapist would move up
would move my left leg forward for me
out the other word hugging my chest to
keep me from falling down as I stepped
forward at the right at that time trying
to walk or is that her probably saying
trying to limp was so exhausting that I
would often return to my hospital bed
from physical therapy and just sleep for
the remainder of the day additionally
wall hospital I need help with almost
every aspect of my daily life and I
would never have expected to want so
badly to return to just doing my own
chores
that&#39;s swelling I&#39;m has some really sick
kids and heard some really really sad
stories
I met one boy who is hockey trained
classically trained cellist and added
club soccer player sadly he benign nose
brain cancer undergone numerous brain
surgeries the last of which has to
definitely alter his personality
I remember watching him walk through the
house periodically hugest lash out
screaming inaudible phrases and crying I
met another boy who&#39;s incredibly content
incredibly bright he&#39;d been shot
lechuck&#39;s though and he&#39;s barely
survived but Owen defend his following
few years living in Spaulding rehab all
by himself while still trying to
graduate high school to D SATs and apply
to colleges
every patient in every room heda&#39;s or
her own tragic story seeing and hearing
these stories didn&#39;t realize for once
how lochia was when compared with many
many of the other patients I reinforced
for me how when scaled appropriately
what seemed like immediate problems are
setbacks in everyday life were actually
and significant and emphasized for me
how grateful I now should feel to be
alive to be looking comfortably and it
just be a living well now live in the
hospital for so long I could really
appreciate the value of it to getting my
feelings there would be times in our to
6ei myself on a problem I thought no one
else could possibly understand
struggling to remember who and covered
it who would come to visit me earlier
that day but coming up with nothing I
would keep it inside for days but once I
could finally come up with the right
words to describe a horrible feelings to
someone else it would bring me a sense
of comfort not because everyone thought
they&#39;d be able to understand me but just
because I thought I&#39;d given them the
information to try and then also turn
11th 2015 I was discharged from the
hospital and finally able to go home the
days on my Hong Kong and home coin party
were some of the first days I thought I
truly felt the immense inspirational
power of moral support those were some
of the best days of my life
although once I find I finally still it
at home
my days were filled with long car rides
doctor&#39;s appointments and outpatient
rehab time after time I would hear that
my recovery was going to be a marathon
not a sprint the more I heard it the
more I could really load that phrase
additionally I rehab I was consistently
told to accept my new normal and come to
terms with why I can cannot do everyone
agreed said afar if I work my butt off I
can&#39;t get back to doing the things I
love but they&#39;ll never come to me as you
say as I used to often times the only
reason I kept working at always because
I understood that it didn&#39;t have any
better options
there were times when I would ask myself
questions like will I ever again do
anything I love will I ever feel as good
as the old me
or will they ever even feel successful
during times like these I found it
immensely helpful to talk to other
people who had been through experiences
similar to mine these conversations
ratted me with a sense of comfort but I
was always looking for some kind of home
run where you&#39;re reframing my situation
one now adopt mystically and make all my
questions and worries disappear
however after numerous discussions I
found myself without the answer I was
looking for
it wasn&#39;t till much later that it
occurred to me that maybe there isn&#39;t
one perfect way to reframe my situation
or cover myself up I stopped ongoing
adversity unfortunately this solution
won&#39;t come to me at the snap of a finger
rather I&#39;ve come to learn that it will
just be something the back of my mind
providing me with comfort and wisdom
from experience now probably when my
biggest worries going through all this
was that I would never again play soccer
as well as I used to but after I thought
about it a lot why I love soccer so much
can you not have two key points number
one I love doing something I thought I
was really good at and number two I
loved doing that thing even more when I
got to do it with my best friends it
then encouraged me that a soccer
wouldn&#39;t continue being my primary sure
particular then I can work hard and also
only get those two key points to apply
to whichever new activity or team I wind
up choosing
since my hemorrhage is by no means fully
recovered I still struggled to do things
with my left arm I&#39;m nowhere near as
well as I used to be and I will always
face problems with that partial
blindness I still have a long way to go
but two and a half years ago going to
high school full-time like I am now
seems like only a vague possibility and
I never would have imagined to have
raised over $40,000 in an effort to
thank Boston Children&#39;s Hospital for
saving my life looking back I wanted
been through and forth but I still had
to come I try to keep in mind a piece of
advice that was given to me about the
father of a friend he told me that going
through rehab and ultimately the rest of
my life I need to look in all directions
I need to look forward and other people
are friends of mine who&#39;ve either
overcome similar diversity or are now
living the way I want to live this is
necessary to be positive motivated and
just working hard every day at the same
time though I need to remember look
backwards those less fortunate and be
appreciative of what I have what I&#39;ve
been given and what I&#39;ve accomplished
and then the final step is to look
within and see how experience has
impacted me taught me and also income to
change me throughout my unless walls of
recovery people continually tell me to
reinvent myself and find my new passions
I&#39;m still ready to let go of who I was
but I think I am ready to abandon this
Denis perfect me that attempts to
uncover the ever-evolving true me thank
you guys
