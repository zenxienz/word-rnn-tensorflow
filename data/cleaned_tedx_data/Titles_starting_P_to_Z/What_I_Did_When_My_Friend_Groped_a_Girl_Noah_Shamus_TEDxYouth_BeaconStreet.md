what would it take for you to affect
change in your community how do you work
up the courage to have an uncomfortable
conversation what would you do if you
saw your friend commit sexual assault I
to answer these questions at the end of
my sophomore year my friends and I we
were having a party celebrating a
successful year of high school I was
talking to a girl for my math class who
we can call Becca when my best friend
who we can call Jason went up behind her
and reach under her skirt and groped her
I immediately addressed Becca she told
me not to worry about it even though she
was clearly uncomfortable in a sort of
rage I go up to Jason and ask her if
what I saw was real and he responded by
saying yeah come on dude we&#39;re at a
party I was shocked rather than denying
his actions he found no wrongdoing in
them I asked if he was serious and he
reminded me once again that we were at a
party a week later he came over to my
house and we were watching an episode of
the office i sat there constantly
wondering if I needed to say something
it never seemed like the right time
so even out of fear of confrontation and
a possible termination to my friendship
in between episodes I pause the show and
decide to have a frank conversation when
I started talking words like bigoted
misogynist and jerk came into the front
of my mind but I paused for a second and
thought would the word friend maybe if
we could start with our friendship he
would listen their conversation was long
and difficult I was shaking with fear he
became distant and defensive I tried
making him more personal
and when I did he became more responsive
but I could see that he was tired I
concluded by saying this was just on my
mind
and I knew that we could talk about it
I&#39;m sure you would have done the same
with me I reach over to my computer and
then played the next episode when the
episode ended we could find nothing to
talk about
and I sense my fear of losing him as a
friend coming true he got up to leave
shaking my hand as we normally did
making fun of the complex handshakes
that all of our other friends had but
this time it felt more routine and out
of tradition rather than the warm
embrace that are simple shaking of hands
normally had since that night at my
house we never spoke about the incident
again but we became more comfortable
having uncomfortable conversations we
learned to talk through the awkwardness
then about a month later seemingly out
of nowhere that could told me that Jason
apologized
there&#39;s didn&#39;t seem to be a reason for
the timing of the apology are there than
built up guilt from his actions she
walked me through the reasons why he
apologized and most of the things that
he said were from our conversation I was
filled with joy but I wondered what&#39;s it
weird to be excited about this this
wasn&#39;t closure
this wasn&#39;t a win this was closure Jason
later told me a story of when he was
with another girl she seemed tentative
and distant and in an aha moment
remembering our conversation he paused
and asked her if everything was okay
and she responded by saying that she
wasn&#39;t sure that she want to continue
and while he still wanted to he Anna CLE
agreed without fighting back he told me
this story as I blushed with pride but I
wondered were there more kids in my
school who were like Jason or other kids
my school who were like me who have seen
things like this before
but didn&#39;t want to say anything I didn&#39;t
want to be seen as a buzzkill or a
social justice warrior
I wondered how could I reach people in
my weekly meeting for my student
newspaper the Highliner we were all
talking about our summers when this
story came to my mind in a jolt of
excitement I proposed the idea to write
about consent education in my school to
the then managing editor and my friend
Jackson he loved the idea he also
realized our school was lacking in this
field but he asked me if I could include
the personal anecdote I was hesitant at
first I would have to tell this story
about my best friend to the entire high
school but I realized that Jackson was
right I needed to show that this was a
pressing issue and telling the anecdote
would get this point across I started
speaking with students girls were really
open telling me about other times that
they had been groped and guys would talk
about the blurry line of consent I then
spoke to teachers and administrators and
they didn&#39;t know how to talk about the
issue with students since the topic was
taboo but there was one thing that
everyone had in common except for our
head of school everyone wanted to remain
anonymous no one wanted to publicly talk
about consent for sex culture so after
sorting through over ten hours of
interviews and going through pages and
pages of notes I wrote and published an
article depicting my high school&#39;s sex
culture it answered questions that most
people didn&#39;t want to talk about I had
no idea the rabbit-hole that this would
take me down somehow I ended up at a
meeting with adults who expected me to
explain the intricacies of teenagers so
imagine me being the sixteen-year-old
boy in this room with 40 year old
administrators I had to be the
representative of the high school body
and explain teen sex culture to adults
when I started talking my face turned
red from embarrassment
of highschool are sexually interacting
with each other but as the conversation
went on I could see that the admins were
yearning for information about our
school culture I was their access point
into an alien world of high schoolers I
saw something said something and the
school responded they implemented a unit
about consent education into our Dean&#39;s
program this is an intimate advisory
track that you meet with twice a week
for three years so let me ask you how
would you work up the courage to have an
uncomfortable conversation thank you
