hello everyone I have a question for you
all what mine when you listen to the
sword bodybuilding protein card ABBA
or maybe egg whites raw egg whites and
milk
or maybe a guy a muscular guy flexing
something like that or maybe steroids
for the youth but let me tell you
something
bodybuilding to me it&#39;s not the literal
meaning which you people think about
bodybuilding it&#39;s actually sculpting
though your bodies it&#39;s stopping the
best physique the way you want it to be
and not actually bodybuilding not
muscular
so bodybuilding to me is actually
sculpting your best physique ever
now when I say bodybuilding and
sculpting the best physique ever that
just doesn&#39;t apply to a statics it also
applies to being strong physically being
independent physically and strong
mentally - my name is Josh mean Chohan I
am NOT thirty-six two years more 38
years old almost 39 and I&#39;m a
competitive bodybuilder I&#39;m an
entrepreneur I own a gym by the name of
sculpt in Gurgaon I&#39;m into powerlifting
and I prepare athletes on the stage for
competition athletes who want to play in
the physique category or athletes who
want to power lifts and today I want to
tell you all about my story my struggles
my challenges how I reached here which
was not an easy job at all and most
importantly today I want to tell you all
how I used weight training resistance
training training with external
resistance to be the best version of
what I am today
so when I say weight training strength
training many things come to your mind
right but weight training is
not just bound to having a muscular body
weight training means a lot
weight training is something which all
of you should be doing not just the
youth but the people who are middle-aged
or all the older people who think now
they are disabled or they are not able
to walk or they&#39;re not able to climb
stairs why do we need to train with
weights why are we shifting gears from
this cardio and doing n number of
crunches on the match why do we have to
do that right that must be a question
coming to your mind now first of all
everybody wants to look great right so
what happens when you do only cardio
only crunches you are just working your
cardio respiratory system you&#39;re just
working on your endurance your stamina
so what happens when you start losing
weight say if a woman is pear-shaped
right so a big pair ends up to be a
smaller pair that&#39;s all what happens but
when you train with weights you can
actually sculpt your body the way you
want it to be say for example a young
boy he has a port belly and he has got
narrow shoulders so all you can see on
his frame is a big belly heading out and
very narrow shoulders he is actually fat
but at the same time he has no muscle
right he&#39;s lean on the shoulders he
looks really thin he looks underweight
but then he has fat on the abdominal now
only cardio won&#39;t help you you need to
train with weights because the beauty of
training with weights is you can
actually sculpt those shoulders those
arms whatever body part you want to work
on and then get that proper V taper if
woman is pure shaped what is pure shape
pure shape is a shape wherein the woman
is thinner on the upper body and heavy
on the lower body so how do you get an
hourglass figure by working more
sculpting war with cardio not with mat
crunches but with weights on your upper
body more if your apple shape you can
work more on your legs and actually
sculpt that body
I get so many young people coming to me
in my gym and I&#39;m really not amazed I&#39;m
shocked to see how many lifestyle
diseases they are coming up with in my
times when I was in my teens or say when
I just started training or even when I
was not training I never heard this word
thyroid hyperthyroid or say pcod PCOS or
whatever you may say I never heard that
a child cannot sit on the floor and then
I really wonder
thank God I was born in the era of the
Indian commode I can so well sit down on
the floor without having pain in my
knees without having any curve in the
back without having any pain but kids
these days they&#39;re having so many
problems so many issues now I hope you
all believe that a healthy body if you
have a healthy body you can enjoy
everything in life even in our Grand
Tours it said that pella sook Nero geek
ayah if you have a healthy body that&#39;s
the first and foremost happiness in life
what&#39;s the use of so much of money so
much of luxury when you are all then you
all have diseases and you just cannot
enjoy that only if you have a healthy
body you can enjoy all the luxuries of
life now with me all this started years
back when I was in the seventh grade and
I was diagnosed with typhoid now that
disease was it&#39;s actually not a very
severe disease if you look at it now but
because I went to the wrong doctors or
maybe whatsoever the case is that
disease was not diagnosed on time as a
result of which I was almost on a
deathbed and I was hospitalized now
because I was almost dead I had to be
revived using steroids steroids it&#39;s a
very hyped word and it&#39;s something which
we don&#39;t talk about usually it&#39;s like
not to be talked
about at all just because of the bad
name it has got but let me tell you
steroids were actually discovered to
treat life-threatening diseases the
diseases which were not cured using
medicines so I was cured using steroids
and as a result of which I got a lot of
acne on my face I lost almost all my
hair and I started putting on weight
because what steroids do is they
increase your appetite as well as they
regenerate everything in your body they
started increasing your appetite and
then I started eating so much I was
eating I was putting on weight
bodybuilders need to have a lot of water
so please excuse me for that so I was
putting on a lot of weight and I was
being ridiculed at home in the school
that I was fat and my cousin sisters
they were lovely they were pretty and
beautiful they were thin they can wear
everything but I cannot I had acne I
look really bad and adverse as a result
I lost all my confidence as it is coming
from a broken family and deserted by my
parents raised by my paternal
grandparents I was a very shy child very
shy and somebody who just used to sit on
the last bench and never used to talk to
anyone so all this ridicule added to my
confidence going down so now what I was
ugly I was fat I had acne I lost my hair
I wasn&#39;t too good at studies and I was
useless that&#39;s what I was told every
single day by my friends so-called
friends I had no friends by my family
family as in my relatives because my
parents they never stayed with me they
never looked back at me what I was doing
what I was doing where I was so
I thought to myself that whatsoever
although I was too young I was just in
the seventh grade I thought to myself
whatsoever I am strong I have to be
strong and I am NOT the way I am be
pro-trade I&#39;m much better than that and
someday I&#39;m going to show this to
everybody out here violence school it
was very difficult to exercise so I
waited till my twelfth and post that I
joined our local ladies gym over there I
got to know that I was really good at
exercising I was really good was told to
me by all the women working out over
there so as I trained I gained more
confidence gradually this happened to me
my profession I never went to any school
or college I did it why a correspondence
so I had no exposure I was still a shy
girl even when I used to take group
classes and I used to face so many girls
and boys in my class I used to be the
instructor standing right in front of
the front of them face to face I used to
actually shiver I was so nervous but
once the class started I was fine
so all this gradually changed it changed
me but one fine day I saw that I was
really thin now I used to take so many
classes a day and I had tremendous
energy I used to jump in my classes my
class students they used to derive all
the energy from me so after years of
taking group classes I realized that I
was underweight
I looked so straight so thin that was
not what I wanted out of my body and
hence I introduced myself to weight
training now the challenges with all
this being a bodybuilder training with
weights the challenges I faced was you
are a woman you are not supposed to look
bulky you&#39;re not supposed to have
muscles you look like a man what are you
doing to yourself
most of the people they started calling
me gay not on my face
because there was much scared they did
not have the guts to do that but yes on
the social media platform I used to get
comments like that you are a gay you
look like a man this is not your field
opening hormones change Kiraly a hangar
but I&#39;m very strong-headed initially I
used to get affected but then gradually
I just took it very lightly what I
realized was that the psychology of such
people is that they themselves could not
achieve what I have achieved being a
woman today and hence they are really
insecure or maybe they wanted muscles
like that and being a man they couldn&#39;t
do that and me being a girl I did that
so the any reason good fit on them so
gradually I just stopped bothering about
that but now today I have so many guys
coming to me for training so I think
that is what I&#39;ve achieved now coming to
the challenges it&#39;s very important to
fail is what I believe it&#39;s very
important to fail because every failure
makes you stronger a very good example I
can give you is of the gym now when we
train in the gym and we train with
weights we train for failure say we need
to do for example dumbbell curl there&#39;s
something which most of you can relate
with ok so I need to do a set of
dumbbell curls for 16 repetitions so I
have to fail by the time I reach the
16th repetition if I&#39;m not failing I&#39;m
not challenging my limits I&#39;m not
pushing myself understand until I fail
on the 16th rep or whatever number of
reps I&#39;ve decided for myself I&#39;m not
going to challenge my muscle if it&#39;s not
challenged it will not grow it will not
get stronger hence the same thing
applies in our real life too when you
train with weights you just do not get
physically strong or you just do not get
away I say that a static body you also
get strong here mentally now when you
get physically mentally emotionally
strong it affects each and every sphere
of
life isn&#39;t it I don&#39;t know how many of
you train over here or how many of you
really love yourself I&#39;m a strong
believer in loving oneself because I
believe that if you love yourself if you
really take care of your body the body
in which you have to live then actually
you can take care of all the people
around you all your love at once
for example if a father is not fit
enough or he is suffering from lower
back pain he comes back home he has a
small kid to play with
now because of his back pain he&#39;s not
able to live the kid why in such a young
age people are having such issues how
will you enjoy with your kid what habits
will you inculcate in your kids your
kids they follow what you do right we we
as kids we follow what our parents do so
if parents they have healthy habits if
the parents they love themselves they
take care of their bodies that will
affect the kids they&#39;ll do the same I
think even in aircraft it&#39;s written do
stroke ISA Hayatou Katniss epithelia
peace ahaituky J right that oxygen mask
you have to wear you have to wear it
yourself first before helping your
counterparts is that true
so please the message I want to give
right away over here is start loving
yourself that&#39;s not being selfish that&#39;s
taking care of yourself once you are
healthy want to take care of yourself
you can take care of everyone around you
you can love the people who are close to
you now when I see so many people coming
in with so many issues I won&#39;t say
people I would say the younger breed
very young girls way young boys who are
actually 18 but it looked like 38
I really wonder I mean they have time
for each and everything they&#39;ll spend so
much of money in the clubs or just
wasting here and there
but it when it comes to their own bodies
they are not ready to spend a penny
they&#39;ll bargain so much they&#39;ll they&#39;ll
actually plead for hundred hundred
rupees to give you discounts but when I
see them in the club&#39;s spending ten
thousand ad ago on a girl or maybe on
the friends that really makes me think
that is it true that the youth today is
really not taking the health on priority
why is it so see just analyze me okay
right now I&#39;m standing in front of you
upright really upright what if I stand
in front of you like this how do I look
really bad I lose some part of my
personality is it now when you are
actually not training when you are not
taking care of your body okay you have a
degree you are something you are earning
a lot but you&#39;re not taking care of your
health you are going to spend all that
money waste all that money taking care
of your medicines you will end up
spending all that or medicines on your
health so it&#39;s really important to take
this seriously prioritize your health
and start working on it when I was
talking about weight training I also
want to emphasize on this that when you
train with weights apart from the
aesthetic thing it also strengthens your
bones now especially women after 25
years of age we start losing bone
density how many of you have got knee
pain vitamin d3 deficiency calcium
deficiency most of it is because of no
training your bones are getting weaker
once you start training with weights
beat any age your younger age or maybe
later it will give you the same benefits
so at least if not for a statics start
training for your health
that&#39;s very important I faced so many
challenges and so many struggles in my
life that the message I want to give you
over here is everyone wants to get
empowered or say feel empowered
what I feel is don&#39;t look at ways to
feel empowered because that&#39;s just a
thin or of paint two things to care
empowered do the hard things struggle
fail fall down get up again and again as
many times as required
that&#39;s armor plating thank you
[Applause]
