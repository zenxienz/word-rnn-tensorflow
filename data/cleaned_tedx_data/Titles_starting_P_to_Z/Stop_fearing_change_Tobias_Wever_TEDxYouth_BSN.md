you
you
change it occurs all around us from
small to big they all eventually formed
the lives we&#39;ve lived today how often
have you moved school or redecorated
your house or maybe even morally new
pair of socks it happens all the time so
let&#39;s start small changes which affects
you personally and your community only
we&#39;re talking about moving house maybe
even wearing some different sock clothes
for once or maybe even changing career
paths many of these changes are fairly
small compared to large political ones
but interestingly enough often affects
our lives the most they are therefore
obviously our concern and very crucial
to our lives however there is a slight
problem within these changes a somewhat
psychological problem which is often
overlooked fear a phobia of change we
often pursuing something with the
mentality of it having two results in
gain almost mathematically like
calculators working out the probability
of loss and gain for personal benefit
and if we conclude that something could
result in loss we ultimately quit but
why why do we quit why is moving house
or country regularly associated with
discomfort do new possibilities new
opportunities you can learn and discover
a lot imagine how exciting it would be
to learn a new language what could
possibly be withholding us from moving
house when taking the hypothetical
scenario of moving country it becomes
quite obvious what we are leaving behind
the known they expected the feeling of
safety this is for many of us important
it is after all the meaning of the same
home sweet home and we want to expect it
not the unknown but however comforting
the expected maybe it&#39;s not very
exciting or educational and prevent you
from taking new opportunities
it&#39;s like barricading yourself inside a
hole neglecting the world around you
well if we think about this this is a
very illogical choice just imagine the
possibilities the possibilities in the
long term while the changes might have
first been discomforting the chance to
change should be a gift now of course
this does not mean that you should
accept changes which could only result
in one feint harm but is it really the
best thing to neglect a change in your
life
and even if we do accept a change we
often still look to the Past looking
back but looking back at our old
hypothetical scenario if you move the
country for example what good does it do
for you retreat into your own community
neglecting neglecting the world around
you there&#39;s no good in accepting the
change if we don&#39;t commit to it we have
to commit I remember back in junior
school during the transition to senior
school we were all very excited for the
opportunities and responsibilities which
came along with it however as we neared
the end of the year more and more
students and pupils became hesitancy
some even disapproving of changes in
their lives while this is a perfectly
logical human emotion often associated
with large changes throughout your life
some pupils even started disapproving of
them even disapproving of them and even
worse neglecting them such mixed
emotions continued for the first few
weeks of senior school but as we all sin
realized what the change was permanent
it wasn&#39;t necessarily bad at all
whatever came our way whatever comes
your way you can benefit from a change
in your life just be prepared to make
compromises along the way the first step
to progress is resilience so that&#39;s from
now on not be afraid of change
but commit to it when opportunity knocks
on the door
let&#39;s invite it in thank you very much
