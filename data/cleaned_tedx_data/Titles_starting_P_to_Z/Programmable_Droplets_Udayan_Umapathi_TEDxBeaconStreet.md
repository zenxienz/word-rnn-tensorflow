water is the medium that makes life
thrive on this planet the most
fundamental unit of life is a cell and a
cell is simply nothing but a bag of
water a droplet in nature droplets
behave in interesting ways like this
little droplet that axis of refractive
lens as it bends a beam of light or
another droplet the traps and most tiny
physical objects like this ant droplets
can even bounce off of lotus leaf
without wetting its surface inspired by
the beauty of water and its
fundamentality to life I have been
investigating how to program droplets of
water and how this impacts how we do
biology hi I&#39;m Diana McCarthy I&#39;m gonna
talk about how we can combine modern
material science physics and solid-state
electronics to do programmable water
droplets and how that&#39;s going to change
how we do biology I started by
replicating 19th century experiments of
physicist Gabriel Lippmann where a
droplet changes its shape as you apply
an electric field as you can see here a
little lentil sized droplet expands and
collapses as you apply and remove the
voltage now if you increase the
potential and rapidly turn on and off
tiny squares on a grid you can move this
little drop move back and forth I
programmed this droplet to control them
how precisely they move to perform this
delicate motion and then I programmed it
to move another another drop around
another droplet to go around each other
as if they were dancing the code allows
for precise control to perform delicate
moves come together and eventually
combine
now let&#39;s take a step back and look at a
biology lab also known as a wet lab a
typical biology lab has a six foot wide
table with biological reagents and
samples stored in tubes bottles and
plastic tray but I want to point out an
essential tool used in a wet lab a
pipette a pipette is nothing but a tool
that transfers small volumes of liquid
now a biologist in a single experiment
transfers measured volume of fluid from
a storage container to reaction
container and disposes off the tip after
each and every operation and this manual
procedure is tedious and even the most
experienced biologist in a wet lab
commits errors and a recent report shows
that 60% of errors in a wet lab comes
from human mistakes and the use of these
pipettes produces massive amounts of
hazardous trash in the form of pipette
tips globally we use four million pounds
of plastic to produce pipette tips alone
and 70% of this goes into landfill now
wet lab procedures are not restricted
only to research and laboratory settings
doctors law enforcement drug discovery
company all mix and move fluids a
procedure that central to their work is
called an assay an assay is nothing but
a analytical method that involves the
detection of a target entity or to
measure the effectiveness of a molecule
or a chemical of interest and usually
some of these assays have hundreds
thousands or even millions of operations
where you move makes and agitate fluids
and the current industrial solution to
this is to replace a human pipetting
with a robot now the problem with these
robots is that they still use pipette
and machines which used pipettes are
expensive and wasteful the pipette tips
have to be replaced for every single
operation and in a drug discovery
company a single pipetting robot can use
and dispose over a million pipette tips
in a week and the result of all of this
waste is a single blood test in the
United States
costing $1,500 and a drug discovery
company spends more than a billion
dollars in discovering one single drug
how do we bring down the cost of
healthcare and healthcare testing from
$1,000 to a $10 if we really have to
bring healthcare testing to the 7
billion people on the planet we have to
bring down the cost of healthcare
testing economically we have to cut down
the cost of genomic engineering and drug
discovery to give you an idea of where
this is all going I want to introduce an
essential piece of equipment used in
complex processes typically in a drug
discovery company or any other
institutions a pipetting robot will
dispense samples of biological fluid
into a micro well played
essentially this is nothing but a plate
with Wells which can hold sample and
over the years we&#39;ve moved from 96 to
382 to 1500 micro Val plates we are
moving towards more and more complex
biological processes which require very
high throughput liquid handling we will
need a million sample well played for
the next generation of biology and
notice how the size of the plate has
remained the same but the sample that&#39;s
being manipulated is reducing we are
seeing massive reduction in the volume
of the fluid that&#39;s being handled when I
actually worked for a synthetic biology
company I built a robot which
manipulates small volumes of
when to put it into one of these
microwave plates and even though one of
these robots had only about a hundred
connection it took more than several
weeks to put to put together this
machine on top of that once in a while a
valve used to break or a bottle used to
explore these machines required a human
supervisor to make sure they&#39;re running
continuously without any accidents
mechanical machines with unreliable
pumps and tubes and valves do not skill
to a million will process manipulation
for the next generation of biology now
if you look back at history we&#39;ve moved
from one simple operation to billions of
operation in a very familiar industry
that&#39;s electronics we moved from ENIAC
the room-sized computer to a kind sized
chip this transition enabled us to go
from a few thousand operations to
billions of operations the cost of
computation came down from thousands of
dollars to just a few cents and today
it&#39;s free we can apply the same
principles of scaling in electronics to
biology the state-of-the-art liquid
handling technologies are like the ENIAC
they&#39;re massive and expensive they
require valves pumps and tubes and they
have to be mechanically put together by
hand and this does not scale to various
operations economically by creating a
solid-state device which does not
require any mechanical connections or
hand assembly we can bring the
complexity we can bring the
miniaturization 2-million sample
manipulations on a single plate
combining biology and solid-state
electronics can drastically reduce the
cost of biological testing on one such
solid-state electronic device that I
created you can move and manipulate tiny
droplets of water with biological
samples for a chemist or even for a
biologist
think to tiny droplets could mean
triggering a chemical reaction in fact
you can even agitate them to perform
mixing now the size of this particular
droplet is comparable with that of a
little lentil but physics shows that we
can manipulate even smaller droplets if
you think about it we&#39;ve already been
using electronics to heat cool and
analyze various materials in addition to
just this particular piece of technology
that I&#39;m showing you now
now automating moving merging and mixing
and analysis of these little droplets
could mean automating entire biological
protocols here I&#39;m showing how you can
move and mix large number of droplets to
perform complex biological protocols and
this particular procedure is called a
serial dilution we&#39;re creating solutions
of various concentrations and a
biologist essentially designed this
particular experiments first on a
computer and then compiled and then
executed it much like any other
operation that you would do on a
computer and biologists can now think of
biological protocols not as physical
experiments but as virtual entity a
program now in the 20th century
computing error we had the tool to
program information in bits through
electronics starting from a few hundred
mainframe computers the scaling of
integrated circuit led us to everything
that we have today millions of personal
computers and billions of cat and
billions of connected devices biology is
the most complex machinery that we know
of and in the 21st century we are
beginning to see the ability to program
biology the most complex machinery this
capability is going to open up new
frontiers and I believe the future of
biology is programmable thank you
