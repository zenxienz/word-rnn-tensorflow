take a moment to imagine what the future
will look like when I was younger I
thought my future world would look like
this but what if this was our future you
see right now we&#39;re fighting an
invisible war currently the casualties
of this war number in the tens of
thousands around the world by the year
2050 that death toll is expected to
reach 10 million people per year and
these deaths could be from things as
simple as a visit to the dentist a
routine surgery or even a small cut
while gardening our nemec&#39;s are so tiny
that they&#39;re practically invisible but
they are deadly they go by the name
superbugs bacteria armed with weapons of
antibiotic resistance but we may have a
weapon of our own to stop these
superbugs in their tracks
honey antibiotic resistance is one of
the biggest threats to global health
food security and development today it
doesn&#39;t discriminate it can affect
anyone of any age and in any country
already we&#39;re seeing cases of people
dying from superbugs that are resistant
to every single antibiotic that we
currently have so how does superbugs get
so super that antibiotics don&#39;t work
against them anymore to understand this
let&#39;s first talk about antibiotics now
antibiotics are drugs that are designed
to kill bacteria or slow down their
growth all the while leaving the human
cells unharmed they can be
narrow-spectrum effective only against
certain types of bacteria or
broad-spectrum meaning they work against
a whole range of
different bacteria generally we like
this broad-spectrum approach because we
don&#39;t always know the type of bacteria
that&#39;s causing an infection and because
infections usually involve more than one
type of bacteria now different
antibiotics can target different things
in bacteria for example we&#39;ve got some
that can destroy the protective cell
wall and some that affect certain
proteins like those that are involved in
helping one bacterial cell divided into
two since their discovery in the 1940s
antibiotics have made many previously
dangerous or deadly diseases easily
treatable but today more and more of our
antibiotics are becoming less and less
effective
now the problem isn&#39;t with the drugs
themselves but because the bugs change
to fight off the effects of these
antibiotics this is when a normal bug
becomes a super bug just like all other
living things bacteria evolved to deal
with changes and pressures in their
environments sometimes they evolve a
super trait in their DNA and this gives
them a competitive edge in survival like
the ability to resist antibiotics these
superbugs then pass on their super DNA
to their offspring and also swap and
share their super DNA with others before
long we have whole armies of superbugs
that are now resistant to multiple drugs
traditionally antibiotics were found in
nature because bacteria and other
microbes are everywhere they&#39;re in the
water in the soil in the air on our skin
and even inside of us and they&#39;re always
competing with each other in a game of
survival to keep each other in check
they use their own biological weapons
antibiotics in fact the first antibiotic
pennis
was discovered from mold trying to keep
those pesky bacteria in check and now
we&#39;re reverting back to nature to find
new ones since the dawn of time honey
has been used as a medicine by every
culture that&#39;s had access to it and
we&#39;ve got records of this shown in rock
paintings and carvings and sacred texts
from many ancient cultures around the
world honey has been used to treat a
wide range of ailments ranging from iron
throat infections to gastroenteritis but
it&#39;s most popular and most effective use
is as a topical application to treat
wounds burns ulcers and skin infections
now the reason for its continued use is
no doubt because honey has potent
broad-spectrum antibiotic activity
although the ancient cultures probably
didn&#39;t use that exact wording since we
didn&#39;t learn about the invisible world
of bacteria until much later
now not all honey&#39;s are equal though
honey is incredibly complex and has over
200 components that are influenced by
environmental factors as well as the
floral source so in the same way that
different honey&#39;s can look and taste
very different they can also have very
different medicinal properties the
activity of honey comes from multiple
factors first honey is made up mostly of
sugar and this can dehydrate or dry out
the bacteria another factor is that
honey is acidic and most bacteria can&#39;t
tolerate this so these two properties
are common for all types of honey
including the one that you guys have at
home in your pantries but it only makes
up a very small amount of the activity
so while these pantry honey&#39;s are great
for spreading on toast their activity
isn&#39;t strong enough to treat infections
in most honey&#39;s that have very high
levels of activity it&#39;s usually because
of the production of hydrogen peroxide
which is bleach and it&#39;s toxic to
bacteria and finally there are some very
rare honey&#39;s with a special type of
activity that we don&#39;t see in any other
type of honey now this activity is
linked to the floral source and the most
famous example of a honey like this is
man
honey from New Zealand it&#39;s the most
commonly used medical grade honey
because of this special activity and
it&#39;s a one that a lot of my research is
based on probably the most exciting
thing about honey is that even though
we&#39;ve been using it for thousands of
years bacteria have never learned to
become resistant to it and we can&#39;t get
them to become resistant in the lab
either like we can with antibiotics
so even superbugs that are resistant to
lots of other antibiotics aren&#39;t safe
around honey it can wipe these out just
as easily as normal bugs
honey based wound care products are
available in pharmacies without a
prescription for home use and in
hospitals for clinical use in lots of
countries around the world including
Australia unfortunately these are still
often overlooked under utilized or only
used as a last resort here we&#39;ve got an
example of an 88 year old patient who
has extensive leg ulcers on both her
legs now she couldn&#39;t walk due to
extreme pain and she was suffering from
recurrent superbug infections for over
20 years
all of the antibiotic treatments she had
tried in that time had failed and her
doctors were now at the point of
amputating both her legs one of her
nurses suggested using honey and within
just 10 weeks those infections had
cleared her wounds had healed and this
patient could walk again
so in this lady&#39;s case the honey had
literally saved her legs so if we know
that honey works why aren&#39;t we using it
in place of antibiotics in the clinic
part of it is because honey is still
seen as an alternative rather than a
real medicine so we need to change these
social attitudes another reason is that
although we know it does kill superbugs
we don&#39;t fully understand how it does
that but that&#39;s something that our
research team at UTS is currently
working on we know that because the
activity of honey comes from multiple
factors the honey also targets multiple
things in the bacteria so they get
overwhelmed and they
fight off all of these attacks by
figuring out how honey kills these
superbugs without resistance we can
develop new drugs that work in the same
way we can also use this to promote the
use of honey in the clinic saving those
antibiotics for when we really need them
by doing this we&#39;re actively reducing
the occurrence of antibiotic resistance
so if we all rush out and start using
honey are we going to run out the short
answer is no probably not
currently New Zealand is the main
supplier of this medical manuka honey to
the rest of the world but the plant from
which we get this honey is also native
to Australia here we call it jelly bush
or the scientific name leptospirosis pcs
growing all around our country so we
still have a huge resource of this
medical grade honey
our research team has recently shown
that the many Australian varieties are
at least as potent as New Zealand manuka
one of the most common questions I get
asked is how does my work affect the
bees currently people are very aware
that the bees are under threat and
without them our food options would be
very limited are we hurting the bees by
using this much honey again the short
answer is no healthy bees need good
experienced beekeepers and beekeepers
need sustainable incomes so by
increasing the demand for and value of
our honey&#39;s we&#39;re helping support our
local beekeepers and ensuring that our
honeybee populations remain healthy and
well looked after
we are fighting an invisible war but we
certainly don&#39;t need to go in blind
honey may be the weapon we need to get
us out of this sticky situation with
superbugs
thank you
