okay what I&#39;d like you to do is to
please turn to the person next to you
and I&#39;d like you to arm wrestle with
them and I&#39;d like you to do that for 15
seconds and the aim of the game guys is
to get as many points as you possibly
can so 15 seconds as many points as you
can turn to the person next to you after
you go
all right that&#39;s time thank you thank
you very much ladies and gents
you can stop armwrestling now okay so
so what I have just asked you to do it&#39;s
an exercise that I do regularly in my
day job so my day job is I teach people
how to negotiate I teach them how to be
more confident when they negotiate and
how to understand their counterparty
when they negotiate and also as part of
my work I like to challenge conventional
thinking about negotiation this idea
that you&#39;ve got to be a ballbreaker to
be a fantastic negotiator I just don&#39;t
buy that but I am often confronted by
this idea that men and women are
different when they negotiate and one of
those differences is that people
routinely say women are naturally more
collaborative and men are naturally more
competitive and yet the arm-wrestle
exercise tells us that&#39;s not necessarily
the case because of course there are two
ways that you could carry out that
arm-wrestle aren&#39;t there and what most
of you did in this room was the very
traditional competitive way of
armwrestling despite the fact I told you
three times and I don&#39;t know if you
noticed this I told you three times you
had 15 seconds to get as many points as
you can so your objective was to achieve
as many points as you can so you could
have approached that competitively which
many of you did and believe me it looks
something like this but there&#39;s another
way isn&#39;t there there&#39;s another way you
could have approached that exercise and
that is you could have turned to the
person next year you could have adopted
the traditional armwrestling stance
thought about your objective of getting
as many points as you can and what you
then would have done is work together
and collaborated to do something like
this but of course people don&#39;t tend to
do that and actually what I&#39;ve come to
the realization of over the time that
I&#39;ve been doing my job
is it&#39;s not as straightforward as women
are collaborative men are competitive
it&#39;s an interesting one actually because
I believe that so many of us
self-identify as collaborative we say
were collaborative we say we like
working in partnership but actually as
human beings our instinct
is to compete our instinct is to try and
win and I just want to say there is
nothing wrong with that as long as we
harness it and do it in the right way
and that&#39;s what I want to talk to you
about today so let&#39;s think about
collaboration so collaboration as I said
already is the thing we aspire to it&#39;s
the thing that we claim that we do it&#39;s
the thing that is fated it&#39;s what
promoted in business and yet so many of
us simply don&#39;t do it we say we&#39;re going
to collaborate but then often we do
things completely that are opposite and
so often in my line of work I will say
to people how are you going to enter
into this business transaction how are
you going to conduct yourself in this
negotiation and they&#39;ll say I&#39;m going to
collaborate but then they don&#39;t they go
out and out to try and win for
themselves and you know what they end up
losing in the long term so whilst
collaboration is something that we
aspire to and we say we want to do so
often we don&#39;t do it and you know why
it&#39;s because collaboration is hard it&#39;s
difficult it&#39;s frustrating it&#39;s
time-consuming it&#39;s challenging it&#39;s
about understanding other people
sometimes putting them before you and
that&#39;s hard partnership is hard isn&#39;t it
whether that&#39;s a marriage or whether
that&#39;s a business relationship true
partnership is difficult but when we do
it well it delivers huge results but so
often it&#39;s a tick box exercise and
competitiveness I believe
competitiveness is actually our default
position as human beings we&#39;ve been
conditioned to want to win and you know
what it&#39;s been like that since the dawn
of time I actually don&#39;t know anyone who
wakes up in the morning and thinks to
themselves today I&#39;d like to lose I&#39;d
like to be below par second-best really
not that impressive yet that&#39;s me off I
go no one does that unfortunately there
are people who wake up in the morning
look in the mirror and go today I&#39;m
going to win I&#39;m a winner I&#39;m not saying
you should do that
but I do think we need to recognize that
often our default position is to compete
and you know what there&#39;s nothing wrong
with that there is nothing wrong with
trying to be the best that you
the so often competitiveness is
demonized it&#39;s seen as negative
particularly when women exhibit
competitive behaviors we are demonized
for it and yet competitiveness is
essential to a successful society
because competitiveness that will to win
to want to be the best is what drives
innovation it&#39;s what drives change it&#39;s
what allows pioneers to keep working and
striving and trying to be the best they
can be
it&#39;s what allows scientific breakthrough
competitiveness if used in the right way
is a fantastic thing however if you
compete and try to win only for yourself
or at the expense of others you will end
up losing in the longer term and I see
it in business all the time I see it in
negotiation all the time people go into
a negotiation with their counterpart
they recognize that they&#39;ve got more
power they go in there to try and win
and beat them and they bully them all
the way through the transaction all the
way through the negotiation and at the
end the deal is still done because the
other side has no choice by that point
but you know as well as I do that person
they&#39;ve been negotiating with over the
lifetime of that contract or the
lifetime of that working relationship
they&#39;re not going to trust each other
it&#39;s going to be strained they&#39;re never
going to go the extra mile for each
other so sometimes I need to win can see
as loose in the longer term now it&#39;s
interesting because to me we tend to
view collaboration and competitiveness
in isolation you are either one or the
other you are naturally one or the other
or you have to approach every situation
with one particular mindset but over the
course of my work my view is that
actually if we marry the two if we take
the best from collaborative behaviors
and we take the best from
competitiveness we can all achieve more
together and that&#39;s how collaborative
competitiveness was born for me by
putting the two together we all start to
win so what is collaborative
competitiveness collaborative
competitiveness is about approaching
every situation trying to win but in the
right way
it&#39;s about striving to succeed it&#39;s
about trying to be the best but not at
the expense of others and it&#39;s about
reclaiming competitiveness it&#39;s about as
being able to stand up and say without
any shame I want to be the best I can be
I want to achieve and I&#39;m not
embarrassed about that because you know
what I&#39;m going to take other people with
me as well so for me it&#39;s about striving
to achieve but not at the expense of
other people it&#39;s about unlocking your
potential whilst helping others to
unlock theirs it&#39;s about striving to
meet your ambitions whilst making sure
you&#39;re not stamping all over the
ambitions of other people and you know
what when you marry collaborative
competitiveness when you bring them
together when you create collaborative
competitiveness each one makes the other
better so actually if you&#39;re trying to
be the best that you can be if you can
collaborate with others whilst doing
that you will win bigger because you
will have enhanced creativity enhanced
ability to make robust decisions you
will be far more innovative and
similarly if we are able to apply that
desire to succeed that desire to achieve
that desire to be the best when we are
working with others then guess what we
will all start to win bigger and we will
get bigger better and bolder results so
collaborative competitiveness it will
help you win but it will help them win
too and I want us to think of a world if
we were all just a little bit more
collaboratively competitiveness sorry
collaboratively competitive think of a
world if we all lived our lives with a
dose of collaborative competitiveness
think of what it might mean if we were
trying to be the best that we could be
but taking people with us at the same
time if when we were trying to win we
were trying to win for us but we were
also trying to win for other people
within our communities other people
within our organizations people at the
other side of the world we could create
real change and we could start it right
here we could all make a commitment to
being collaboratively competitive in
every decision we make
every action we take it&#39;s a small change
but it could deliver big big impact for
politics for how parties conduct
themselves for how public policy is
developed and applied for how funding is
distributed and in business think of the
impact it would have on productivity on
innovation on our ability to create and
just develop a well where everyone is
included collaborative competitiveness
we can all start here we can all make a
commitment to make the world change it&#39;s
a small thing that we can do when I want
you to think about collaborative
competitiveness I want you to think you
can do this you can own it and you can
tell the person next to you to do it and
own it as well tweet out what are you
going to do today to be more
collaboratively competitive together we
could change the world who&#39;s with me
