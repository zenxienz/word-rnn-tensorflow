how old were you in 1979 just try to
remember go back in time I was 14 years
old do you know how the world looked
like in 1979 any idea the biggest
innovation of 1979 was the portable
audio cassette player by Sony I I think
a lot of 14-year old children don&#39;t even
know what an audio cassette tape is in
your home there was no computer the
personal computer was introduced by IBM
in 1981 the world has changed
dramatically since 1979 totally
different we moved from the Industrial
Age into the digital age everything has
changed except education except schools
they are still basically functioning as
a factory to illustrate this I will
introduce you to Ronald Ronald is 17
years old 17 and he just finished his
high school that gives him the right to
enter to a next phase of education
higher vocational education a University
of Applied Sciences
the first thing he has to do is choose a
profession do you really have to choose
a lifelong profession when you&#39;re 17
years old yes you have otherwise you
cannot enter the system because the
system is about four year programs that
prepare you for an outlined profession
so Ronald is forced to choose and he
chooses before becoming a teacher
English an English teacher it&#39;s a
four-year degree program so Ronald steps
on the assembly belt the production line
that brings him to English teacher but
after four months grown are things I
don&#39;t want to become
an English teacher and so in let&#39;s say
in February he quits the program and now
he has to wait another four months five
months six months to enter an all
another production line and in order he
has to wait so he starts working in a
supermarket you see a lot of them in
supermarkets around March April June and
by the way his parents lose 2,000 euros
of tuition fee that&#39;s paid for Rollins
so next September Renault enters this
production line that prepares for human
resource management but in the last
months he lost his learning attitude so
he fails to pass the first exams and
because of dyslexia he&#39;s not very good
in the multiple choice tests so at the
end of the first year he does not have
the 54 out of 60 points that are
required to go to the second year so he
has to quit again he has to say goodbye
to his classmates for the second time
his parents lose another 2,000 euros by
the way and next year September he will
try again maybe Social Work Ronit is no
exception
any idea how many of the first year
students in higher education quit in the
first year in percentage 35% and how
many do have a degree or a diploma after
five years the program is only four
years but after five years if you enter
in the first or how many of them have a
diploma after five years 48 percent less
than half of them row notes is
everywhere I&#39;m sure that you have a row
note in your surrounding
isn&#39;t it you can be your own out it can
be your son can be your daughter and you
know how it feels when you have a child
or a student that does not fit into the
system you know how to I know how it
feels because Ronald is one of my
daughters one of my daughters started
two times with the first year first time
not the right choice second time her
dyslexia made that she didn&#39;t make the
first year and I know how it feels
makes you sad and angry angry about the
system and now there are in the position
to change the system it motivates me to
try it just right I know with a lot of
colleagues that is a hard job but we
must because the system itself is
outdated and it&#39;s outdated for three
reasons the first one is that every
child is unique there is no average
student
there&#39;s ro not yes your son is my
daughter and the problem is not that my
daughter does not fit into the system
the problem is that the system does not
adapt to my daughter that&#39;s the real
problem education should not be a system
or affection it should be a personal
service the second reason why a system
should change is that we know by now a
lot of learning that we did not know
that say in the 19th century who of you
did learn anything in the last two years
it&#39;s very risky not to show your hands
at the moment did you learn anything in
the last of you just learnt nothing yeah
you did learn something who have you
attended the classroom in the last two
years
25400 its lifelong learning what I see
here but we we know now the the
education as a factory or school as a
factory is built on the assumption that
we learn by sitting in a classroom
listening to a teacher transferring
knowledge by now we know that effective
learning is about a lot of other things
it&#39;s about projects it&#39;s about teamwork
it&#39;s about real-life situations etc and
the third reason that the system or
education should change is that we must
adapt we must learn our students to
adapt to a rapidly changing society the
whole idea that a row notes or your
daughter or your son should choose a
lifelong profession at 17 is ridiculous
we know by now that a lot of professions
we have nowadays will disappear in the
next decades and that new professions
will appear and that we need new skills
we call them the 21st century skills
they are about creativity about ability
to cooperate about critical thinking and
specific those skills you do not learn
them by sitting in a classroom and
listening to a teacher you listen you
learn them in other ways so school as a
factory will not work in the 21st
century and what&#39;s the alternative I
think it&#39;s time for a new paradigm
school not as a factory but education as
a service and school as an open platform
and three elements are essential for
this alternative the first is
professional coaching the second to
flexible personal learning path and the
third a seamless learning experience
first professional coaching in my dream
the school career of row notes starts
with a personal assessment who are you
what are you telling us what motivates
you and if you not if you don&#39;t have an
outlined idea of your future profession
it&#39;s no problem just let&#39;s discover it
let discover your future and we do not
start a four year fixed program we start
a personal
learning journey and personal does not
mean individual it does not mean
studying alone it means that it&#39;s fit
for you
but as soon as we have had this
assessment of Rho naught we allocate him
not to a classroom not to the classroom
with 25 students who have chosen the
same route but we allocate him to a base
group a learning community with a
personal coach and a group coach and
this learning community will accompany
you throughout your school career saying
goodbye to your classmates can be rather
traumatic so professional coaching is
the first element the second is a
flexible personal learning path
nowadays we divine a program a degree
program by the courses you follow by the
inputs so if you follow this course you
can do this test and in the end you have
a degree in the future we will define
courses not courses but a program by
learning outcomes what are the skills
you have to acquire what is the set of
knowledge you should prove to have
mastered and the way you acquire those
skills or the set of knowledge it&#39;s free
and the tests we do the testing is
independent from the learning activities
you have chosen this is a real
revolution in education that&#39;s starting
nowadays and it opens the world of a
flexible personal learning journey
learning paths for every student and the
most important outcome of this way of
education is that the student learns to
take ownership of his own learning as a
preparation for a life long learning
journey site coaching and a flexible
burden personal learning path the third
element is a seamless learning
experience a seamless experience that&#39;s
what you expect from Netflix from Amazon
or ball
pentagons you expect them to adapt to
you know the other way around in a lot
of schools it&#39;s still the other way
around you can illustrate it by walking
if you go into a school every hour you
see a lot of children moving from one
classroom to another classroom and the
teacher staying in is his or her
classroom just think about how strange
in my opinion should be the other way
around the classroom is the community
room the home base of the group of
students and the cultures or the
teachers should be on the move and in my
future dream of education as a personal
service teachers coaches the building IT
schedules stewards everyone in a school
as a team works together to offer a
seamless learning experience to a
student so waiting four months or six
months as Ronald had to do in order to
enter a new program that&#39;s no service
you don&#39;t accept it from Amazon or BOPE
and chrome that they make you wait four
months to deliver a package why do we
expose our children to such a bad
service my dream for Rho not for his
children for my children or
grandchildren is that education or
higher vocational education starts with
a personal assessment that we don&#39;t
force children to choose a profession
but that we start the journey the time
to discover their future that they
become part of a learning team and that
they stay part of this team during their
school periods and that they are support
supported by a personal coach and that
their route is flexible if they need
more time there is more time if they
don&#39;t pass multiple-choice tests there
are other tests
my dream can be summarized as follows
school as effective in school as
affection in the old ways everything is
fixed what you learn where you learn
when you learn how you learn with whom
you learn it&#39;s fixed only one thing is
flexible your success in my dream of
education as a service
everything is flexible when you learn
where you learn how you learn with who
you learn one thing is certain you will
succeed
I think this dream can become true there
are a lot of schools we do it in swallow
there are schools here in harderwijk who
try and I are experimenting with this
personal learning path I think it&#39;s time
for change
did you ever took time to listen this
Pink Floyd song to the very end it&#39;s
it&#39;s a long track but on the in the end
you hear it you hear a telephone there
is a telephone ring it&#39;s an urn answered
telephone someone is calling education
or schools it&#39;s time to change
I think after 38 years it&#39;s time to
answer this phone and change education
from a factory into a personal service
thank you
