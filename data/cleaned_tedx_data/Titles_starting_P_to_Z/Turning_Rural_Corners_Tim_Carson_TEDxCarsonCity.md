good afternoon we have a good time so
far
excellent you know the steam train back
in its day was one of the most
technologically advanced pieces of
equipment that came to our country and
frankly it changed our nation forever
the forefathers sought and recognized
the vision that would connect our nation
from sea to sea to shining sea using
this new technology it was a tremendous
time and it forever changed our country
as the Train progressed as though the
rails were built and we moved across the
countryside the Train had to stop for
fuel had to stop for water and every
time it stopped people got off people
got off and entrepreneurs got off and
towns were born we recognized that
through people and Commerce
opportunities were here were found
across our nation and interestingly
enough the train stopped every 10 to 12
miles and today as we cross our highways
and byways across the land if we follow
the rail line we will see the remnants
of those days when those towns were
flourishing although today some of them
may not be as flourishing as others the
are leaders of the day recognized that
the spaces between rails needed to be
populated there was tremendous Bassett
rant ranges of land that needed the
population to be moved there so our
forefathers came up with the Homestead
Act
the Homestead Act was an opportunity for
people to sign on the dotted line and
acquire a hundred and sixty acres of
property for their very own through
little or no money it was amazing time
and quite frankly my great-grandfather
was one of these people and people came
from far and wide they came from the
south they came from the east they came
from across the ocean they came from
around the world to look for prosperity
right here in North America and by the
time everything was said and done nearly
400 million acres was provided through
the Homestead Act it was a tremendous
time but not all was sunshine and roses
as people came across the land as my
forefathers as my
great-grandfather came across the land
he packed up his family and he packed up
his his hopes dreams and aspirations he
packed up his faith and his intellectual
property and he packed everything into a
trunk and he came across on a on a ship
and he got on a train and he trekked
across the land and he staked his claim
and where he staked his claim and where
other stake their claimed was not always
that prosperous some of it was dry and
arid and we couldn&#39;t actually do the
things that we wanted to do there some
of it was forested and we had to clear
the forest and break the land in order
for us to actually produce what we knew
how to produce in agriculture or more
than that some of us some of those
people staked their claim in northern
properties you&#39;re not going to believe
this but some flowering sometimes in the
north up to five months of that ground
can be covered with snow so they were
hard times they were challenging times
and frankly some of those people they
weren&#39;t up for that challenge and
although millions migrated to the rural
areas it wasn&#39;t for everybody for those
people who it wasn&#39;t for did they go
home no they didn&#39;t go home they went to
the town so as for as many people that
transferred into our rural areas by 1920
by 1920 there was 50% of the population
lived in the towns and 50% of the
population lived in there in rural areas
in places west like Alberta where I&#39;m
from it took until 1956 before the the
population actually rose in the cities
higher than in rural areas so we were a
declining population right away in 1956
only 47 percent of the people still
lived on the farm in Alberta this
erosion continued and even through
mechanization and through the evolution
of Agriculture they were able to produce
far more on their property than they had
ever produced before using way less
people we had combines we had tractors
we had cedars we had mowers we had
things that we had never had before in
this mechanization in the evolution of
Agriculture further eroded the
population in those areas we just didn&#39;t
need those people and even though
forestry and mining and those those
types of Commerce were still in rural
area
the evolution of technology allowed us
to do more than we&#39;ve ever done before
with fewer people continuing to erode
the population in our rural areas this
trend continues today as our population
our part vias are as our equipment in
agriculture continues to gain size our
farms get bigger we&#39;re in corporate
areas where where we are actually
farming massive places and the equipment
that we use can do the work of a hundred
people in an afternoon we are currently
sitting as a nation at 80 percent of the
population is living in our cities and
in some places in the West that&#39;s as low
as 17 percent now we are on the cusp of
the driverless car becoming mainstream
here in North America
agriculture is on the cusp of becoming
driverless equipment it is it is totally
the trend that is happening and the
continued erosion of population in rural
areas is staggering and the trend is
looks like there&#39;s going to be somewhere
around 10% of the people servicing
ninety percent of us so why should we
care about this so if we live in a rural
area some of the services that are
absolutely provide are required for us
there are emergency services ambulance
and fire even today some of this
response times for ambulance and fire is
anywhere between 45 and 90 minutes
farming is a dangerous dangerous
commodity whether you&#39;re ranching or
traditional farming access to emergency
services it&#39;s absolutely critical and it
is completely driven by the population
professional services like doctors
dentists accountants lawyers are truly
required in rural areas and we need them
to know and understand our particular
business know our region know who we are
and be in our areas so that we can
access that and have them provide the
quality of service that we need
beyond that we have the services to our
families and our own business so the
grocery stores the lumberyards the part
stores the mechanics the hairdressers
all of this is completely driven by
population if we don&#39;t have the
population to support those business
people they&#39;re not available to us
beyond that is the quality of life for
the people living in those rural areas
we have recreation so the hockey rinks
and curling rinks and community halls
and riding arenas and rodeo grounds and
all of those types they are completely
dependent on population if we don&#39;t have
the people coming out to our events we
can&#39;t do them and then there&#39;s our
schools the education of the people in
rural areas is absolutely critical for
the sustainability of not only the rural
areas but society in general we have to
educate our young our youth and without
enough people in those schools we have
seen the devastation of the school
closing in that small community it&#39;s the
dying breath if you will of that
community but not all of us live up
rural so if you live in the in the major
city centers so why is the rural
population important to you well let&#39;s
be honest we got to eat right at the end
of the day one of the things that rural
provides us is a stable locally sourced
locally grown opportunity for us to
consume it&#39;s truly amazing and if we are
able to provide this diversity and food
process for us the value added that goes
along with it the opportunity for
regionally grown wines and and craft
beers and craft distilleries along with
the cheese&#39;s and and things of that
nature we actually can create a regional
palate for ourselves that supports our
urban lifestyles as we continue to
embrace the electronics age the
electricity required for the for the
technology in our pockets for their
computer at home for the world wide web
for all of the things that we do some of
that energy can be produced in rural
areas frankly with the new technologies
and the new
opportunities that are coming up and the
things we haven&#39;t even thought of yet
can be realized in rural areas so as we
continue to grow as as society as we
continue to rely on electronics and
things of that nature energy will be
something that we will need and will
require and rural populations can help
provide us with that let&#39;s not forget
about community no matter who you are
where you live what you do you require
community community of your neighbors of
your peers of who you are and what you
believe in is vitally important for a
strong and healthy society we need
choices for the people that live here
choices on the size of their community
and where they choose to live whether
they&#39;re big or small or a major
metropolitan area or a tiny little rural
town we need to be able to have those
choices so that your children my
children and their children will have
those opportunities so where does the
opportunity lie we&#39;ve already talked
about traditional agriculture and how we
are we are producing more food than
we&#39;ve ever produced in our in our whole
history of Agriculture with fewer people
the trend is we don&#39;t need that many
people there anymore the oil and gas
industry is another one where it says
that a footprint firmly planted in rural
but their technology is advanced
advancing as quickly as anybody else&#39;s
and they don&#39;t require the numbers of
people that they used to we need to
continue to be environmentally aware and
know and understand that the people and
our children and their children will
need a safe and wonderful place to live
in the future and we also need to
recognize that there has been a
tremendous investment in infrastructure
across not only the major metropolitan
areas but also in rural so where is this
opportunity what can we do to increase
the population in our rural areas I take
you to the corner the corner is an area
recognized as less than productive it&#39;s
an underutilized piece of property that
is currently in in rural we can drive
across the countryside we can actually
point them out in this illustration you
can actually see it&#39;s a pivot irrigation
system and the corners are not used so
what can we do with those corners
what is the opportunity with new
technology to utilize these corners to
draw new people to draw young people
than families to our communities in
rural we also have marginal lands lands
that we&#39;re actually never designed or
never ever used to produce agriculture
in a regular way to produce food what
can we do with these properties are
there technologies today today and
tomorrow that we can utilize to bring
people into their communities and
provide them the opportunity to utilize
these pieces of property we also need to
recognize the small town the
infrastructure in rural is currently
designed to support far more people that
are there right now they have roads they
have sewers they have water they have
power they have internet they have
accessibility they have infrastructure
they have everything that we need in
order to bring people back but we have
to give them the reason to do that so
who&#39;s going to do that and why what&#39;s
going to happen there there are key
people across all of North America that
have an influence on bringing people
back to rural we have economic
developers we have community developers
we have municipal councils we have state
and provincial governments who all can
play a role in building a path to the
corner and building a path for people to
access the corner we have universities
we have colleges we have technical
institutions and we have corporate
partners who have the ability to develop
technology that will allow people on the
corner to be successful generate wealth
and provide value back into the
communities and societies those are some
of the keys to this whole program is the
opportunity like our forefathers to use
the new technology probably newer than
the Train and identifying space and
creating a path for people to find their
prosperity this is not about ensuring
the history and the heritage and
protecting the heritage of our rural
areas this is not about that this is
about ensuring the vitality and the
future of rural areas so we can
celebrate our heritage look into your
corners identify the technologies and
build a path for people to be successful
and reinvent rural thank you
