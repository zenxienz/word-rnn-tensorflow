all right so as they announced my name
is Courtney Kane and thanks you guys for
staying it&#39;s been kind of a long night
but try my best this evening so I&#39;m
gonna take you through my journey
towards getting a PhD now this story it
doesn&#39;t start exactly at that moment so
I have to take you back a little bit so
as the youngest daughter of two Haitian
immigrants Raymond and Yannick
there were several family ideals that
were huge in my household discipline or
in my dad&#39;s words discipline
perseverance always making sure you
would get over that hump family and
community and education a love of
learning now the reason that my dad left
Haiti in 1968 was because he had a
vision he saw himself giving himself and
his family a better life and what was
contingent upon that better life was
educational opportunities so he left
Haiti at the age of 25 came to Chicago
send for my mom who was only 19 at the
time a year later and they worked hard
blue-collar jobs to make sure that my
sisters and I would have that better
life now my oldest sister Nadine became
a doctor and my next sister Daphne
became a lawyer then there&#39;s me I was
hoping that just being cute work out for
me but at some point I figured I&#39;d have
to do something but what was that
something again a lot to live up to a
doctor a lawyer and cute is not really
how that was gonna go what would that
look like for me so the second it was
after my sophomore year of college that
I received an email about a summer
internship for
those who are interested in part 8 and
perhaps getting a PhD going to graduate
school hmm that seems like potential
maybe a PhD would be something that I
could do so I applied got into the
internship it&#39;s called the summer
research opportunities program that you
will buy and I spent 10 weeks
researching something that I loved
writing a paper and presenting it it&#39;s
me and my poster presentation and it was
it I felt it that was what I was gonna
do I was gonna go to school and I was
gonna get a PhD in my favorite subject
history yes I&#39;m one of those people
history has always been my favorite
subject and I thought I could do this
man like grandmas school was easy high
school is pretty easy college pretty
easy can a PhD be pretty pretty easy and
I was wrong it was horribly wrong about
that but what ended up getting me
through that crazy seven year journey
towards a PhD were those family ideals
that had been instilled in me
perseverance a love of learning
education family support community
support and discipline those would get
me through anything those could get you
through as well and I&#39;ll show you how
well let&#39;s take it - not even getting
right away into the program thinking
about getting into the program the GRE
the Graduate Record examination the bane
of my existence
now I prepared for the GRE because it
was part of every application that I had
to do and went to go take the test and I
remember I walked into the room and I
immediately felt like a hamster in a
cage because it was literally like a
cubicle do you have to sit in to take
tests i sat there I started to take the
test and I got hot I&#39;m kind of a hot
person anyway so I was like okay this
may be just normal
then I start to sweat but again that&#39;s
typical so I was like okay but then I
got dizzy then I started to feel
slightly nauseous so I immediately
raised my hand above my cubicle and
asked where the nearest bathroom was I
ran out I ran to the bathroom and I got
sick really sick and I looked at myself
in the mirror and I just cried how was I
gonna get into school if I can&#39;t even
take the entrance exam what was this
gonna mean I&#39;d set my sights on this
it&#39;s what I was supposed to do
I want the tears for my eyes went back
into the room and finish the test and
let&#39;s just say my scores reflected that
incident in the bathroom so I went back
home I studied and I said I&#39;ll take it
again I persevered went for a second
time same cage-like experience same
sorts of things start to happen the
second time start to feel sick hot
sweaty by the time the nahji set in told
myself no no Courtney you were gonna do
this take the test and finish it so I
did my scores were a little bit better
but that was enough so I figured okay
scores are not looking that good
everything else may look a little good
let me go talk to somebody in the
admissions department of the school I
want to apply too and see if maybe
there&#39;s some way they can give me some
information on maybe make my application
better so I sat down with the chair of
the history department at the time and
sat down with a big smile on my face and
I was like I want to come to school here
get my PhD she looked at me and said No
that was it she said no I was like why
oh and she was like because you&#39;ve done
your bachelor&#39;s here and we do not
accept students who did their bachelor&#39;s
here I was like why I don&#39;t understand
um and so I got my bag I thanked her
you remember grumbling to my car this
doesn&#39;t make any sense I just took the
GRE twice oh I want to go to but I was
like you know what nobody tells a
Haitian person no I&#39;m gonna apply and I
did and I got in I persevered I didn&#39;t
listen to the no I didn&#39;t listen to that
guy so that got me through the door and
starting August of 2010 I actually began
my real journey towards the PhD now I
thought this by this point was gonna be
pretty simple had some stuff go wrong
again wrong kortnee wrong so the first
part of my P process included getting
into the program what I said but
starting my classes getting paper
slaughtered I mean one paper came back
to me and it was had so much editing on
it that the professor just started
writing across the page across my
writing yeah but I was making it but I
knew I had something in my back pocket I
knew I to advisors that I was gonna work
with while at the school I felt good
about it
they were both teaching things that I
loved we had a working relationship it
was gonna be fine
towards the end of the first year I get
an email from one of the professors
asking me to come meet him in his office
and I thought it&#39;s probably gonna be one
of those papers again but it&#39;s okay I&#39;ll
survive it I sat down I looked at him
and he announced that he would be
leaving the University at the end of the
year
okay a little destabilizing but that&#39;s
why I had to you know that&#39;s called a
back-up plan so I was like this will be
fine have a second one then a couple of
weeks later I got an email about that
professors departure from the university
great
now was I gonna do both advisors are
gone do I leave the school - it&#39;s only
my first year do I go with them they
weren&#39;t really asking me to go with them
so that wasn&#39;t a possibility so what I
do I looked on the college website and
in our department and I just scrambled
knew I wanted to learn from somebody
who&#39;s already learning so much I didn&#39;t
want to stop now
I found a professor who kind of did
stuff I was interested in and remember
going into his office he had his feet up
propped up on the desk and I was like mm
hi
I need mid visor he was like okay take a
class with me we&#39;ll see how that goes so
that was a big class night to make sure
I shine bright like a diamond words of
Rihanna and I did I did and he signed me
on to be his advisee great second year
late nights reading three books a week
doing tons of response papers sitting in
three-hour seminars arguing about things
like feminism and globalism and all the
isms but it felt good I was learning I
was learning things I wanted to learn
and it felt liberating I could take
classes about things I wanted to like
women there were tons of those classes
people who look like me there were tons
those classes and it felt amazing so by
the time it was time for my third year I
knew what I wanted to research for the
big shebang of your PhD the dissertation
the ingenuity of an idea that nobody
else had thought of but you and you were
gonna write it had it always loved
learning about black women and civil
rights and I found an archival
collection in Chicago that was untouched
or so I thought
and I was gonna do it so new professors
moved into our department and I went to
go meet with him see it similar
interests me I sat down and I told him
what I was gonna research my grand
dissertation idea he took a sip of his
coffee and said I actually just went to
a conference
somebody just deposited that
dissertation what I said you sure he
said yeah no no they do so ran home
again went on the computer did some more
investigation and he was right person at
the University of Chicago had just
deposited that dissertation now there
were tears in my eyes this time now it
was like I&#39;m halfway through I&#39;ve gotten
the masters loving what I&#39;m doing but
it&#39;s three months until I&#39;m supposed to
defend a dissertation idea and now I
have no idea what I&#39;m gonna do so I
looked at my then fiancee now husband
and I just said what do I do
he said why don&#39;t you do something about
being Haitian you&#39;re always talking
about being Haitian and I was like no
yes I am
so I don&#39;t on me huh something about
Haiti my parents are from apparently
what I always talk about so I did some
research found out there was a lot about
Haitians in the United States but
specifically Haitians in Chicago and I
knew Haitians in Chicago existed because
I was one of them but nothing had been
written about them that was it that was
the topic and it was that love of
learning but that family support that
got me to that new topic if it wasn&#39;t
for my husband I don&#39;t know what I would
have decided at that point that
community and that love actually sent me
on a journey of self-discovery and a
topic that was perfect for me in fact
that&#39;s what got me to go to Haiti for
the very first time in my whole life so
one day while I was visiting my parents
I looked up at them in the kitchen and I
said I&#39;m going to Haiti my dad said
you&#39;re not going anywhere without me
and I said okay and then we called my
sister Daphne and she said I&#39;ve been
waiting to go let&#39;s totally go and then
we just sigh died my oldest sister and
she was like hey yeah okay guess I&#39;m
going to UM and then my mom deemed
herself to be the dog babysitter so she
did not go what just was totally fine
but in December of 2015 I embarked on a
almost week long journey my father and
my sisters and our motherland and it was
everything I immediately felt something
inside of me that had been maybe void
but I didn&#39;t realize was filled I got to
see family members I hadn&#39;t seen in
years or had never met before I got to
drink a lot of Christie&#39;s beer which
that&#39;s a thing and so good everybody go
to Haiti and drink prestige beer I got
to soak up the culture a blend that was
so close to me because it&#39;s where my
family is from but also about what I was
writing about it make sense so I came
back and I was ready to write so I
thought discipline or DC plan that final
year of graduate school year seven had
to finish up
and so I buckled down I was working and
teaching a class I was writing it was
editing it was reading and editing
writing teaching discipline that&#39;s what
got me through that final year even when
it came time to do job allocations crazy
person so my advisor looks at me in the
middle of this final year and goes you
might want to think about what you&#39;re
gonna do when you finish and I was like
why and he&#39;s like you might want to
think about that so then he sends me on
this journey of having to do job
applications and personal statements and
teaching statements and research
statements and syllabi creation that
same GRE feeling
washed over me again but I landed a
couple of interviews and ended up
landing my dream job here at Lake Forest
in two departments that had meant so
much to me history and african-american
studies then I really had to be
disciplined because I kind of needed to
finish to really you know start working
so I edited and wrote and edited and
wrote in cried and edited and wrote and
complained and edited and wrote and
finally the day came my dissertation
defense 269 pages of research seven
years of my life came down to two hours
i sat in a room with my family my
parents my husband in particular my
community colleagues friends who came to
support me and also just in case things
didn&#39;t go as planned
I was ready to go some people&#39;s with me
but it was fine
two hours of intense questioning and
finally they let me back in their room
and I saw my committee was clapping for
me and they announced that I had passed
but I didn&#39;t hear them at first took a
minute
because suddenly everything over the
last seven years had washed over me the
GRE that no the losing of two advisors
and the gaining of two more advisors
after that that Hail Mary pass for my
husband for a dissertation topic the
trip to Haiti that final years so many
sleepless and crazy nights of writing
and editing and then the tears hit
because I realize I had done it and how
had I done it those four elements
discipline perseverance family and
support from them and a love of learning
got me across that finish line I walked
that curve line to the PhD and without
those four things I wouldn&#39;t have done
it and I wouldn&#39;t be the woman that I am
today I know that I can do anything I
know that if I&#39;m disciplined enough I
know
hold myself up high enough that I can do
it and now I&#39;m in a position tell other
students and other people to do the same
thing so four things need to get a PhD
at least from my perspective discipline
perseverance a love of learning and
family and you can do it too thank you
so much
[Applause]
