hi my name is Lauren Stevens and I was
born profoundly deaf
you&#39;re probably questioning my ability
to talk to you today but all my life
I&#39;ve had to practice hearing in talking
in order to converse with in society
here the question for you when you
encounter a deaf person how do you
initially perceive them as a person
disabled than yourself
I mean Bobo culture was simply a normal
member of society I am the only one in
my family who is deaf and I have
encountered all of these perceptions
when I was diagnosed the profound when I
was diagnosed with profound hearing loss
18 weeks old my parents faced a dilemma
they could choose to raise me with New
Zealand sign language or they could
choose to enroll me into early
intervention programs which would teach
me to hear and to speak as a result they
faced two strongly opposing Jews the
deaf community told them yet they were
denying my right here the DIF child if I
do not learn UDL in sign language and
that my deaf identity would be stripped
away from me
rather than perceiving deafness or the
disability it is perceived if something
you were born with into the difference
that should be embraced in contrast the
hearing world argued that if I did not
acquire verbal and auditory skills I
would have to be held back in school and
in many areas of development because I
grew up in a small town that did not
have a large deaf community my mother
was determined that I would learn spoken
language so that I would be able to
successfully interact within society and
my dad who are the musician wanted me to
grow up sharing his passion for the
Beatles in the diplom thus I was
enrolled in twin against of
auditory-verbal program in Australia
it&#39;s st. Gabriel&#39;s School for the Deaf
at st. Gabriel&#39;s I was taught to come
into spoken language so you think one
with the jewel hearing ahead with the
help of my hearing aids hearing
exercises involved the complete removal
of visual cues such as lip-reading so
that I&#39;d have to listen for certain
vowels in consonants to identify a word
for example if I was spoken to the
speaker would place their hand over
their mouth like this
so I wouldn&#39;t be able to read the lips I
began this program when I was 5 months
old and successfully completed the
curriculum at five years old this
process Sid me on the part to integrate
in a world for the hearing
I would then enrolled in a mainstream
school in the way I experienced
situations in the hearing world of the
deaf child was vastly different in that
of my peers difference can be isolating
if that&#39;s considered to be an invisible
for the call disability and normally
people understand what it means to be
deaf now with my hearing aids I could
only hear up to a certain point in the
wooden until I received a cochlear
implant did I realize just how bad my
hearing loss previously I could only
hear very low-frequency sound but with
the cochlear implant it opened me up to
an entire new world I can now hear the
clock ticking bees buzzing and my
personal favorite the sound of a more
important awesomest night yet there is
always something I miss out on for
example if I&#39;m conversing with in a
large group of people it&#39;s like walking

into a bar at 2:00 a.m. full of drunk
first-year University student just
yelling over top of one another I have
no idea what they&#39;re saying or which
direction the voices are coming from
this is just one example there see if
there&#39;s a reminder that I am stoned to
death to give to be completely part of
the hearing world now the Deaf world I
had very little association with I grew
up with one or two differing
but they signed I were then able to
communicate directly with them and
relied on my teacher aid to interpret
what they were saying as a result I felt
alienated from the deaf community if he
were the huge language barrier that I
did not know or I understand I was
reluctant to become involved and I felt
more comfortable being in the hearing
world we are they born
socialize and communicate with others
admittedly I viewed members of the deaf
community there&#39;s people who are even
more disabled than I was because they
did not have their hearing or all the
schools that I have so I could not
understand how they were able to succeed
and interacts with in society so what
changed my perspective when I began
learning sign language ed University it
suddenly became so much more than just a
university paper in the first class of
the course I had no idea what to expect
the teachers themselves the Deaf and do
not use spoken language but because of
this I did not feel the pressure to work
harder than others and felt like I was
on an equal playing field with everyone
and within I realized that deepness is
not another disability it is an identity
and learning new deal and sign language
to help me find that identity here the
deaf individual I&#39;ve been wanted to
experience what it was like being in the
deaf community firsthand so I began
going to regular events set up by the
Wellington deep Society the deaf
community does not just involved if
people but hearing people who have the
appearance or deaf children although I
was surrounded by technically strangers
there was a feeling of belonging and
familiarity that I did not quite
experience in the hearing world members
of the deaf community may not share the
same political views or religious
beliefs but what brings them together or
the culture they see out of sign
language and shared experiences
did people have all experienced
complications in frustrations in trying
to navigate in a predominantly oil
society especially in that society is
limited when the social requirements of
deaf people are not volcano for one
misperception is that if people are
limited as to what they can and can&#39;t do
they do not see themselves as incapable
and focus on the abilities rather than
what we would consider to be a
disability they hip this perception
because in the past deepness was viewed
at the condition that had to be treated
supposed to a deaf person in the early
to mid 20th century a time in
communicating in any other language
except spoken English was strongly
discouraged sign language especially was
too different to outstanding and was
perceived to be an embarrassment when in
captivity that had to be corrected as a
result language barriers were set up
between the two world one point I want
to emphasize here is that sign language
is not a universal language it differs
based on the collective Society of a
particular country New Zealand sign
language with only formally recognized
as New Zealand&#39;s theatre fishel language
in 2006 but there is still a lack of
exposure around the importance of this
language it&#39;s a basic right but if
people New Zealand sign language in many
ways it&#39;s not just a form of
communication it is an art science news
dimensions of time in space to perform
visualizations of toys in poetry greatly
contrasting from spoken English it is a
vibrant expressive language and although
those sentences the structured and
simple forms it is a way to sign that
conveyed it express a lot of meaning for
example facial expression is a key
concepts used to identify between a
question or a statement
and often science depend entirely on
context to understand the conversation
Winona New Zealand sign language for
some people it can be a step out of
their comfort zone it&#39;s a very emotive
language and they may not be used to
communicate in such a bold visible way I
would need a party a few months ago and
a friend of mine who is also learning
New Zealand sign language began a
conversation with me on opposite sides
of the room by signing them wasn&#39;t long
until I realized that the room had gone
did quiet about 15-20 people had stopped
the conversations and we&#39;re just
watching us with spoken language it&#39;s
easy to ignore the conversation of
another person but when signing it&#39;s
hard not to draw attention to something
that is really seen in the general
public so I&#39;m just a little bit back
from the microphone here now when people
first meet me most do not realize I am
deaf usually the first thing I am asked
is do you have an accent don&#39;t you are
you from Europe and I&#39;d really love to
say yes here because it makes me sound
so much more sophisticated but growing
up I wanted to perfect my speech so that
people would be able to understand me
better and that I&#39;d gained the
confidence to speak in front of
audiences in additional 12 years of
speech therapy and speech competitions
helped me achieve this however I think
I&#39;m to realize that not everyone
responded the same way when I said
actually I have an accent because I&#39;m
deaf and I would become concerned that
they would not see me as a person equal
to them one instance was when our their
degree of expert in Aversa tea and was
having interest
gosh mother include er about Social Work
at one point I mentioned that I was in
fact dear and the attitude instantly
changed they didn&#39;t save that well in
that case perhaps her role in
communications wouldn&#39;t be suitable for
you but of course the other roles in
administration you could consider and I
was thinking okay well if communication
is such an issue for me how exactly are
you carrying out this conversation right
now this was a huge blow to my
confidence and often the doubt of others
strongly impacts my own sense of
self-worth am I really not as capable
who they think I am but becoming part of
the deaf community taught me that
deafness is not a limitation and that
there is no reason as to why their
language barriers between worlds nice
diagnose dear the profoundly deaf child
displaced me inside a box will I
received the therapy and education they
set me up for life inside the hearing
world I was still perceived as disabled
that because I am deaf there are certain
things I cannot do but for me I do not
see myself as someone who is severely
lacking in the hearing department
because deafness is normal for me I
always keep the best night&#39;s sleep
without fail and that includes sleeping
through my claim age from aging house
parties by embracing the differences
between the differed in the hearing
world that will create opportunities to
open up doors for communication rather
than sit up and maintain the barriers
that are currently in place do with the
evidence that New Zealand sign language
or the visual mode of learning for both
deaf and hearing children have been
effective in brain development in
cognitive processing regardless of
whether they use spoken language or not
into the basics right for deaf people to
be able to develop the linguistic and
cultural identity by signing research
has shown that by both signing
and reading or speaking did people are
more likely to achieve academic success
and fully participate in the next of
member within the wider community
ethanol society we have the tools and
responsibility to make this world a more
inclusive place for those who do not
communicate orally I had we thought
there being part of the hearing world
was the be-all end-all of effective
communication as a person with hearing
loss but becoming part of the deaf
community open a door to a culture I did
not know existed in the language of my
own right thank you
[Applause]
you
