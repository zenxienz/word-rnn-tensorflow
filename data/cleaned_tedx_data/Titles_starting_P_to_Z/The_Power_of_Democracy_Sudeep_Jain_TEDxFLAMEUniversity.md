amongst the students were born before
1st of January 1998 can I have so a
large number all of your eligible voters
how many of you are enrolled as voters
okay you&#39;ll find in urban India the
educated youth still do not go and vote
a large number things are changing but
we still have large number who do not go
in for why the first answer comes my
vote would hardly make a difference
there is no good candidate and do I vote
for democracy itself is a farce what are
you talking about asking me to go in
vote and finally will it make a
difference to our inefficient
governments today I&#39;ll not talk about
the first three points I&#39;m sure you have
been given enough arguments against
these and if not you can always Tobel
those up I would like to talk a little
about inefficient government&#39;s the
fourth point have you ever come across
examples experiences which give you any
hope about government anything the
government has does which give you hope
for future of India are there any
examples which can show you the power of
democracy
yes can I make a difference can we
contribute to anything towards
nation-building
so before I share some of my experiences
let me tell you something about myself a
little bit which you may not find on
Google I had been a science student
always in love with
six so you can say a rationalist bent of
mind I always believed that everybody in
government is either corrupt lazy or
inefficient and you can see where I have
ended up I had hardly visited a village
in the first 25 years of my urban
upbringing and ended up my first 10
years in the career primarily working in
rural India now just to have some
positive examples which I had the good
opportunity to come across my second
assignment 800 of my sanitary workers
decided to go on a blood donation
protest mass blood donation protest to
support my action as City Commissioner
of thermal Valley against the property
tax defaulters when I was able to
finally convince them that this much of
blood will go waste we didn&#39;t have any
facilities to store this much of blood
they finally decided to do the Japanese
way worked an hour extra every day for
next one month where the black ribbon
tied on their hands our tax collection
doubled I woke up a day with a nightmare
that there are no Children&#39;s Park where
the kids can go and play in the city or
next six months we were able to
construct 64 small children&#39;s parks
internally and 25% of this contribution
came from the citizens we were able to
convert a stinking garbage yard the
eyesore of the neighbors the centralized
dumping yard into a dense forest by
planting 10,000 trees on the periphery
these examples can go on and on as head
of Sports Development Authority in Tamil
Nadu
we were able to increase the number of
students number of kids who were being
coached in summer coaching camps from
five thousand to one lakh without a
single additional penny from the
government as I said there are numerous
examples which I can quote but let me
just share with you one incident which
was kind of a life life-changing the
thought changing incident for me I was
posted in 2001 as District Collector of
Naga Putnam how many of you have heard
of Naga Putnam so I can think of some
sizeable contribution population from
Tamilnadu here Naga Putnam as you can
see on the map is one of the most
backward districts in Tamela in India
population of roughly 15 lakh 85%
farmers 13% fishermen tail end of Kaveri
River you keep hearing about all kinds
of disputes between Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka on Calvary&#39;s so they learned
of Kaveri River as a result only if
there is any water left it reaches there
2002 was the year of fourth successive
droughts in Naga Putnam you can see the
condition of the barren fields how the
fields had actually cracked up now what
do the farmers do they end up conducting
heavens pouring hundreds of liters of
ghee trying to invoke rain gods now here
let me just share with you in India
governance is not just about rolling out
good policies or programs for the
benefit of the citizens governance is
also about emotionally sharing their
sufferings and happiness
and as a result I ended up participating
in scores of such ovens because the
farmers wanted these they believed in
these and you cannot go and tell them
that no I am a physics student I can
tell you it&#39;s not going to rain so this
has what was going on one day finally
frustrated I said no we need to do
something different we mobilized
like-minded citizens like-minded farmer
leaders and decided that let&#39;s do a mega
tree plantation something more
scientific which might bring rains not
to raga patnam but maybe to Amazon
forest we don&#39;t know but let&#39;s do
something which is at least a little
more scientific by 25th November by the
time we were able to identify a
contiguous piece of land where we could
target to break the previous existing
world record so a 50 hectare of land we
could identify the monsoons were all
long over in Tamil Nadu
we had to surpass the previous record of
42,000 saplings planted by a team of 300
persons in 24 hours so we decided let&#39;s
make arrangements let&#39;s target this
number we move 50 thousand saplings on
the site and started the exercise where
we well-prepared we had seven days of
planning complete seven days from the
day we were able to actually identify
this line sixteen hours into the attempt
we realized we haven&#39;t been able to plan
properly we realized we had set a wrong
target
we were running short of saplings next
six seven hours whatever numbers we
could mobilize we got another 32
thousand supplies on the site and finish
the attempt with a new Guinness record
almost doubling the previous record we
had planted 80 thousand

2:44 saplings in 23 hours we had no
siblings left after 23 hours and so we
ended up doing this this is what you can
see the thousands of villagers and
farmers from all over the district who
had gathered there celebrating does it
call for celebrations have we achieved
what we had targeted yes we have
surpassed the previous record by almost
double but what was the main objective
did the rain gods get happy we also had
three religion priests doing a non-stop
24 our prayers to invoke rain gods while
this plantation was going on but did it
rain the story still continues as part
of Guinness guidelines we had appointed
three observers three credible observers
but machinery misses Krishna Madiga
Newton who later on won the alternate
Nobel Prize vellore Srinivasan who was
later featured in South Amer ji and
Padma Shree dr. Padma Subramanyam the
Bharat Natyam dancer who later was
awarded Padma Bhushan dr. Padma
Subramanyam suddenly took the public
address system from my hand and said I
want to sing she said I want to sing a
raga which is to invoke rain words let
me tell you there was not a single cloud
anywhere in sight she said I do not
guarantee that it&#39;s going to bring rains
but in the past whenever I had sung it
it had rained within 48 hours
with this she sang in Tamil a poem a lap
ever known
I now want rains
the mm or crowd standing there sang with
her next 20 minutes they sang and the
day ended next morning I woke up with a
nightmare that all these saplings 80,000
of these have died well we had made all
arrangements for long-term war training
by digging 64 large ponds there we had
completely missed out on that first
watering we could assemble around 400
sulfur Brooke women tried our level best
and finished watering by the end of the
day covering only 40,000 saplings the
rest of the 40,000 saplings there was no
hope that these would survive the next

day 6th of December morning 5:00 a.m. I
started getting calls the villagers were
calling to inform that the entire place
is flooded the district of Naga Putnam
the entire stretch had 76-millimeter of
rainfall on 6th of December this not
only saved the 40,000 saplings it also
saved the thousand crore worth of paddy
crop which was standing on one lakh
hectare of land do you see any
connection any scientific evidence what
about my physics background what were
the lessons learned faith can move
mountains
I&#39;m sure majority of you are not going
to believe this you have all been
brought up with a rationalist bent of
mind and this is how education has to
teach and as the right way of doing it
but here is an example where I was
confronted with this and had to believe
that yes faith can move on
his world record a high enough target to
set for yourself you had seen us
underperforming we had one more hour of
time left but we had no saplings
available with us
two years later Asian tsunami struck the
coast of way of Bengal in the entire
country Tamil Nadu was the worst
affected Naga but now was the worst of
the worst affected districts 6000 lives
were lost in Nagar Puttnam this
plantation which we did for invoking
rain gods became a tsunami barrier this
was the only village which completely
survived the belt of cashew Rena trees
which were now 2 years old 12 feet high
were able to bear the entire brunt of
tsunami and save the village and
reporting like this which you see in
Indian Express actually shelved the
project which government was
contemplating of building a concrete
wall across the entire coast of Tamil
Nadu while we visited the village again
after tsunami with some of my college
alumni they demanded that can you
comment the entries on the remaining
stretch of coast which is lying barren
we promised that we will do our best
somehow the other will come back and
plant trees form the tsunami
rehabilitation trust by name--but
tsunami with my College Alumni
Association and incidentally the name
was coined by one of our colleagues here
yd with this we went ahead decided that
yes let&#39;s try and surpass our own
plantation record this time we thought
we will do a better planning a better
so targeted 1-lakh that let&#39;s plant one
lakh trees now raised a nursery for one
and a half lakh saplings on the ground
three days before the attempt we were
told that can we increase the target
because we were doing this for tsunami
victims in memory of tsunami victims
worldwide there were total of 1.7 four
lakh tsunami victims
so can we instead of one lakh can we
target for 1.7 for luck we said let&#39;s go
ahead and do it the same team of three
hundred farm workers started the
exercise we had by that time moved
another fifty thousand saplings on the
ground so two lakh saplings were
available and in 16 ARS 1.74 was crossed
we again knew that we are going to run
short of saplings moved whatever more we
can frantically and finish the entire
event once again with one hour to spare
with two lakh 54,000 464 saplings
planted by a team of three hundred
persons in the given time of 24 hours
even though we had one more hour left
this you can see is tripling the
previous record so over the two attempts
these farm workers 300 of them had
actually surpassed the previous record
by six times what are the lessons
learned
records are meant to be broken ceilings
are created only in our minds there are
no other ceilings thinking small is a
crime the citizens have such a strong
power each of us have such a part that
if we start utilizing even a small
fraction of it we can surpass any kind
of records so with these words
please students the only message I&#39;ll
have is go aim for the sky nothing short
than that and enjoy the journey thank
you
[Applause]
