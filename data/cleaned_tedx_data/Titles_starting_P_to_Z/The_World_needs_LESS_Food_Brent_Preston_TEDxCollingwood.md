okay I want you all to think of a time
when you did something really rash and
impulsive when you did something
entirely on a whim without any
forethought or a rational contemplation
all right you&#39;re thinking about it
whatever it is you came up with I bet
mine is bigger and crazier 14 years ago
I bought a farm now before that my wife
Gillian and I were normal
urban professionals we lived in downtown
Toronto we had good jobs a nice house a
couple of really young kids and then one
day we just kind of lost it and we
bought a farm I honestly can&#39;t remember
what we were thinking at the time but
suffice it to say we had no plan no
experience and not much of a clue when
we moved to the farm in 2004 we started
a garden we started growing food for our
family and we started giving away all
the surplus food we grew to our friends
and neighbors and after a year or two we
came up with the brilliant idea of
actually farming the land we were living
on we started selling in the farmers
market in the nearby village of Creemore
then we started selling to restaurants
in Toronto and the farm grew slowly and
very painfully until it became a
full-time job for both of us now
our farm has evolved over the years but
from the very beginning we had a few
defining attributes we were small we
were organic we grew a huge diversity of
vegetables and we sold everything we
produced locally rather than shipping it
far and wide this seemed like a logical
plan to us when we started but the more
we got to know our farm neighbors the
more we realized that our farm was a
freakish aberration on the local
landscape all of our neighbors were
growing commodity crops using huge
machinery and lots of chemicals and they
sold their output on the international
market our neighbor bill who lived down
the road told us that he would wake up
every morning and check the soybean
futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange so he could forward sell his
crop two years before he actually grew
it if the price was right as urban
transplants and beginner farmers these
types of conversations made us feel very
small and very unsafe
educated our farm neighbors were also
curious about what we were doing that&#39;s
actually that&#39;s not true
our farm neighbors thought we are crazy
and listened they listened with morbid
fascination as we tried to explain the
delusional type of Agriculture we are
practicing I would very earnestly
describe what I thought were the
benefits of small-scale organic farming
but time and again I would get shut down
by one simple argument the farmers we
talked to were always very polite but
they knew they could shut us up with
conventional Agriculture&#39;s knockout
punch what you&#39;re doing won&#39;t feed the
world now in the early years this
argument was really terrifying to us
maybe they were right we thought maybe
the type of farming we&#39;re promoting
would lead to mass starvation this which
is worrying of course this notion that
the primary goal of conventional
agriculture is to feed the world was
something that the farmers we talked to
had obviously deeply internalized they
would often talk about the chemicals and
machinery they used as a kind of
necessary evil
we don&#39;t love spraying all the time and
burning so much diesel but we have to if
we want to feed the world this message
is propagated and reinforced by the big
agricultural companies that dominate our
farming system there are constant
references to the growing world
population to the ever-increasing number
of mouths we have to feed with more and
more people sharing our planet we simply
need more food now Gillian and I are big
walkers we would often go on long walks
from the farm and we would talk about
this big idea and we&#39;d also observe the
large scale industrial farming system
that dominates the landscape all around
us as years went by our walks got longer
and longer but no matter how far we
ventured the landscape looked the same
in every direction what we saw were huge
fields growing just five crops corn soy
wheat canola and hey let me show you
what I mean this is what our farm looks
like today this is taken in the spring
when our crops are just starting to grow
all of our gardens together total about
20 acres if we zoom out a bit we see our
immediate neighbors each one of their
feet
is bigger than our whole garden area the
field across the street from us grows
corn one year and soy the next year
after year if we zoom out more we see
some fields that are 10 times as big as
our whole operation 200 acres are more
of just one crop but even at this scale
it&#39;s still just corn soy wheat canola
and hay we could keep zooming out but
the story would be the same all over
North America vast stretches of the
continent being dominated by just a few
crops now we started to wander on these
long walks just where all this food was
going if the goal of the industrial
farming system is to feed the world what
exactly is the world being fed it didn&#39;t
take a whole lot of research to figure
out the answer
virtually everything that was being
grown in our neighborhood was being used
to make three things meat sugar and
processed food we couldn&#39;t wander into
any of the fields we passed on our walks
and pick something and eat it none of
the corn that was growing in those huge
fields was the kind of corn that you
roll in butter it was all destined to
make animal feed and high fructose corn
syrup think about this the next time
you&#39;re driving past a farmer&#39;s field if
you were to stop the car and walk into
that field would there be anything there
that you could actually eat no matter
where you are in North America the
answer will almost always be no
virtually everything that&#39;s grown on a
typical North American farm must be fed
to animals or processed before it can be
eaten
that&#39;s when Gillian and I started really
questioned this assertion we kept
hearing that industrial farming is
necessary to feed the world it&#39;s easy to
agree when a farmer or a big
agricultural company says the world
needs more food but what if they said
the world needs more meat sugar and
processed food that doesn&#39;t sound quite
as compelling does anybody really think
that the world needs more meat sugar and
processed food what if we began to think
all of the problems associated with our
current food system the environmental
the economic to health problems what if
they weren&#39;t a necessary evil that we
have to accept in order to produce
enough food but we&#39;re instead a
consequence of producing too much food
and too much of the wrong kind of food
that&#39;s when things started to make sense
it turns out there&#39;s a huge global
surplus of food recommendations for
daily calorie intake vary according to
your age your gender how active you are
where you live if we take the US
Department of Agriculture numbers
moderately active adult men should eat
about 2600 calories per day and 2,000
for women if we average out the
recommendations for kids and older
people on a global level we get a rough
figure of 2,100 calories per person per
day that&#39;s the optimum but according to
the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations in 2013 there were
almost 2,900 calories available for
every woman man and child on the planet
that&#39;s a 37% surplus of calories and
these figures are for food available at
the household level that&#39;s bought paid
for ready-to-eat this doesn&#39;t even
account for the huge amount of food that
is wasted before it gets to our homes
now you might be thinking that these
figures are skewed by massive
overconsumption in rich countries but in
Africa a continent we often associate
with hunger and malnutrition
there were over 2,600 calories available
for every citizen well over the average
daily requirements so after years of
farming and observing what was happening
in our own neighborhood and researching
what was happening at a global level we
came to a simple conclusion we&#39;re
producing too much food and too much of
the wrong kind of food meat sugar and
processed food so what are the
consequences of that the first is simple
our food system is making us fat and
sick according to the british medical
journal the lancet
obesity now kills 3 times as many people
as malnutrition and again this is no
longer just a first world problem more
than one in 10 Africans are now obese
the rate for Latin Americans is almost
one in four this is leading to an
epidemic of diabetes heart disease
cancer and other diet related illness
that&#39;s sweeping across the globe with
massive economic and public health
consequences overproduction of food is
also having overwhelming environmental
consequences
there are huge dead zones in the Gulf of
Mexico and the South China Sea caused
primarily by agricultural runoff we&#39;re
the only thing that can survive our
jellyfish on land agriculture is by far
the biggest driver of habitat loss which
is causing mass extinction the rapidly
increasing use of systemic pesticides
like neonicotinoids is wiping out
insects and invertebrates at the bottom
of the food chain leading to disruption
of the scale of whole ecosystems too
much food means that food is cheap which
has all sorts of economic consequences
the average Canadian farm loses money
year after year razor-thin or negative
margins of pushed farmers to get bigger
and bigger to use bigger machinery more
chemicals and less labor to try to get
by rule North America has been
depopulated as farm sizes increased and
farm jobs have disappeared cheap food at
the household level means more food
waste some research have estimated that
up to half the food we grow never gets
eaten when food is so cheap we simply
don&#39;t value it but the impact of
overproduction that I&#39;m most concerned
about is the impact on our climate the
role of our food system in climate
change is hard to overstate by most
estimates animal agriculture alone
produces more greenhouse gases than
transportation think about that raising
animals for meat puts more co2 methane
and other heat-trapping gases into the
atmosphere than all the planes trains
and automobiles on the planet now I want
to stress that hunger and malnutrition
are still big problems but as we&#39;ve seen
we have a global surplus of food hunger
and malnutrition are political problems
caused by poverty inequality and armed
conflict we won&#39;t do anything to solve
our hunger problem by increasing the
food supply on the contrary the
combination of poverty and abundant
cheap calories has given rise to a new
and rapidly growing problem people who
are both obese and malnourished at the
same time when we understand that we
have too much food all of the problems
of our food system makes sense and the
central role of food in so many of the
big pressing issues we face becomes
clear now
this is a long list of problems it would
be really easy to look at this list and
become hopelessly depressed but we can
also see this list as an opportunity if
food is so central to so many problems
then changing the food system can help
us address all of these problems all at
the same time so what can we do to start
we need to fundamentally change our
mindset as human beings were hardwired
to think that we always need more food
but that&#39;s no longer the case we don&#39;t
need more food we don&#39;t need more food
in an individual level or at a global
level we need less food but more
importantly we need different food we
need better food as an individual
consumer you can have an impact on the
entire food system simply by what you
choose to buy and eat the first step is
simple eat less meat if we all ate less
meat we would improve human health we&#39;d
slow down climate change but we had also
free up millions of acres of farmland
that are currently growing animal feed
to grow healthier foods which is the
best way to feed a growing population if
you do eat meat
choose grass-fed and organic okay what
else we need to eat more fruits and
vegetables and again choose local and
organic we need to eat less sugar now I
know you&#39;re sitting there and thinking
I&#39;m starting to sound like your mother I
apologize but the great thing about this
prescription is that whatever is good
for you is also good for the planet now
I&#39;m going to say something else that my
mother at least would never say don&#39;t be
afraid to pay more for food when we buy
cheap food the true cost of that food is
borne by farmers by farm workers by the
environment and by our own bodies North
Americans spend less of their income on
food than any other Society in history
good food is more expensive we can and
should pay more individual actions like
these are important but they&#39;re not
enough we also need to work collectively
to change food policy at the local and
national levels sugar is harmful and
addictive it should be taxed
we need an aggressive public health
campaign to encourage people to eat less
meat we need to end the subsidies that
encourage overproduction of commodity
crops especially and I haven&#39;t talked
about this yet but it&#39;s very important
we need to end some
cities and mandates for corn ethanol
which is very costly consumes millions
of acres of farmland and has zero
environmental benefit we need to support
farmers as they transition to more
sustainable methods and convert to
organic production switching to more
sustainable farming methods is not easy
or cheap and it won&#39;t happen without
public support now according to the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the UN
small-scale farmers in the developing
world most of them women already produce
the majority of the world&#39;s food the
truth is that industrial agriculture
doesn&#39;t feed the world small family
farms do we need to support these small
farmers so that they can meet the
continuing challenge of growing good
food for all now Gillian and I have come
a long way since we packed up and moved
out of the city more than a dozen years
ago our farm is still small and organic
but it&#39;s also profitable we&#39;ve paid down
all our debt our farm is our family&#39;s
sole source of income and we also
provide jobs for nine full-time seasonal
employees this year we&#39;ll produce well
over half a million servings of fresh
organic vegetables on our little 20 acre
farm our farm is still an aberration but
in a good way we think we found a viable
alternative to industrial agriculture
and our farm is far from unique all
across the food system we&#39;re starting to
see positive change if you&#39;re a chef a
food entrepreneur a foodie an aspiring
farmer or just a plain old eater you
have a role to play in changing the food
system you have a role to play in making
the change we need start now thank you
