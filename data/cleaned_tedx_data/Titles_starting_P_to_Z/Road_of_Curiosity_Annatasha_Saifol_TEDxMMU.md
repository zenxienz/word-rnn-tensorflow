good evening everybody my name is Tasha
but you can&#39;t call me Tasha for short
because I Natasha is a pretty quite a
mouthful
okay so it&#39;s kind of weird being on
stage without any music playing in the
background I&#39;m usually used to singing
but now I&#39;m just talking and I&#39;m pretty
sure you won&#39;t be able to make me stop
talking I have 20 minutes though so I&#39;ll
try to keep this short and sweet all
right so while waiting for my slides to
come on I&#39;m gonna tell you a little bit
of myself my name is a Natasha I am
currently a Berklee College of Music
student I major in sound engineering
music production and sound engineering
yeah and it took me a long time to be
able to call myself a musician because
of this whole journey I&#39;m about to
explain to you it did not start I am NOT
like Jasmine where I was born and I knew
I wanted to do environment like you know
I was more like okay let&#39;s see what else
is out there for me I mean I had a rough
idea of what I wanted to do but I
couldn&#39;t like commit to that without
trying different things as well at the
same time so let&#39;s see I started off
with dance this is work hey I thought I
would dancing I did musical theater in
high school all throughout I was a
ballerina I can&#39;t don&#39;t do the splits
anymore I can&#39;t do that anymore and then
after that I went on to try singing I
did the whole commercial music they did
a video clip with some local artists
also I was like I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t
feel like being like a superstar or
anything and then I went to after I
finished high school I was kind of
nervous because the whole music think
it&#39;s kind of a risky business because
like you don&#39;t know whether you&#39;re gonna
pick up and become a superstar and stuff
like that so I was like what other form
of art have I not explored yet and it
was cooking so I applied for tail and
until his university for a cult my
culinary major surprisingly even though
I like kind of hated it at first I
finished I stuck through I committed I
finished got my diploma and then left
school to start a business which was my
pastry business that picked up pretty
well you know and then
these are some of the other dishes I
cook you know just some shameless
advertising and then with the money that
I actually earned from cooking and
selling my macarons I did the whole
delivery thing like I would cook
Saturday to Sunday and then Monday go to
like 13 houses from shot I love to come
to Siberia and everything in
hand-deliver my goodies and from that
money I actually ended up travelling
because that&#39;s the other thing I didn&#39;t
do before that I also took pictures
photographs it was an easy way quick way
to get money they all you know my
friends already had pretty faces and
good clothes and all we had to do was
just take pictures and just sell them
and so I went traveling and that was one
of the best time of my life
after that I&#39;m finished traveling I will
tell you the story in detail in a bit
but after the travelling happened I
found myself applying for birthday
college of music and then now this is my
job I sit in the studio for like from 3
a.m. to 6 a.m. in the morning mixing
other people&#39;s music not in the live
light whatsoever but still doing music
so I was like this is perfect for me so
about being curious sorry I have my
notes this nervous a bit always taught
me how like just ask questions like
don&#39;t be afraid there is no question
that is stupid but just always remember
to never be rude or insensitive and
asking these questions it could be any
questions from I don&#39;t know let&#39;s not
get into it but like politics and then
science and an environment and also just
self questions like what do I want to do
for myself what else is there out you
know we we are we&#39;re always
concentrating on one thing we forget
that we&#39;re probably capable of doing
other things so why do I encourage you
to ask questions it&#39;s because questions
leads to ideas and ideas lead to
experience all around the world or just
here in KL or Malaysia on its own it&#39;s
all you have to do first is ask a
question oh alright is it next night
already but when you&#39;re asking these
questions I want to also advise that you
keep an open mind and an open heart
because when you ask some questions the
answers are not gonna be your ideal
answers
you&#39;re either gonna be disappointed or
offended and so you have to remember
that a lot of people have different
kinds of answers and you&#39;re just got to
be open to it so for example this is a
story that&#39;s going to come out quite a
lot during this talk I was 15 and I
really wanted to pursue my musical
theater so I heard that was this
beautiful school in Australia to do
Performing Arts and become the next
Broadway star put on yella then I got
there applied all that money all that
time went there went for my first ever
dance class and then realized I answered
my question as of what is it like in
Australia to do performing arts got
there got an answer and it was not the
best of answers what it was was that it
was not as good as a program I already
had here in Malaysia and I was thinking
if I spend the next five years studying
high school here and doing musical
theater here I&#39;m not gonna personal
personally feel as fulfilled as I would
if I was back at home I mean you know I
was a bit of homesick as well but you
know I still wanted to be back home with
my teachers who I have you know me since
I was very small until this high so I
left I came back to KL and I was
everybody was like you know talk to my
mom like in that why you let her do that
with so much money make so much time but
she&#39;s like if she&#39;s not gonna be happy
if she&#39;s gonna be miserable we might as
well just make her happy at home and
I&#39;ve learnt this from my mother as well
is that if you make a wrong mistake
there will be there will still be time
to turn things around and that will
still be money to make in the rest of
the world
you cannot worry you just have to work
for it and look for it so thanks also
having gone to Australia having tried it
out I have no regrets no regrets coz if
I had stayed here some of my friends
spent to the same school they made it
but I went there and it wasn&#39;t for me
but it&#39;s okay no regrets so also another
thing is that nothing is certain
having come haven&#39;t come all this way
through all my journeys and even ending
up in Berkeley which is you know a
really good school for my music
production and sound engineering I have
this ideal plant
becoming a sound engineer for Pixar
Animation Studios when I finish fingers
crossed
hi Pixar if you&#39;re looking but have have
a good Nutella like you know have a
down-to-earth kind of mentality because
I feel like if I don&#39;t get that job I&#39;m
gonna try for DreamWorks and then if
DreamWorks doesn&#39;t want to hire me I&#39;m
gonna try for any monster or something
you know I&#39;ll do anything cuz I want to
work in animation nothing is certain but
at one time I got into a cab and I told
this man in Los Angeles I was like I
want to wear for Pixar Animation Studios
one day and he said you know what girl
you have a plan that mean it&#39;s gonna
happen it was like oh okay
thank you and that&#39;s where I realized it
is really important to have a plan and
when you have that plan just work
towards it but also some people like to
have that tunnel vision and work towards
the plan me on the other hand I have a
vision that road that&#39;s going towards a
plan but I always remind myself to
explore on the way there it&#39;s good to
take breaks which is not hurt or read as
get distracted but it&#39;s good to just you
know enjoy the right because like I said
nothing is certain if you get there and
you were rushing there you forgot to
pick up some friends along the way or
pick up some traits along the way you&#39;re
gonna get there not get the job and have
nothing to remember it by I feel that
you should pick up some memories because
some experiences meet you people so on
the way there even if you don&#39;t get it
it would still be worth it you know it&#39;s
like driving to a different state taking
a nice leisurely I don&#39;t know
Missi paja and then like you know you&#39;re
you&#39;re admiring the outskirts of town
there&#39;s no cities is where there&#39;s less
cars on the highways and stuff like that
and then as opposed to like rushing to
the state for a meeting you&#39;re like I
was gonna swear I&#39;m sorry I was like I&#39;m
gonna be so late for my meeting
you&#39;re just zooming there you don&#39;t see
anywhere else you don&#39;t want to get into
an accident it&#39;s kind of nice if I pick
up some scenery along the way anyways
so an example for this was when I was in
high school the how do you say the goal
in high school was to get your high
school diploma but along the way I
picked up scuba diving and musical
theater and then in culinary school when
I decided to do cooking instead I picked
up photography and also like some social
media stuff because it was the in thing
to do you don&#39;t be a social-media
influencer kind of thing and then now at
Berkeley I&#39;m doing videography on the
side besides just sound engineering so
it&#39;s just like I have I have I have a
path I&#39;m just gonna you know stop to be
deadlines you don&#39;t think I speed up and
then after I go back you know so next up
everybody this is like the biggest
question thank you all right and why was
that the next up is the biggest question
which is money like finances is gonna
hold you back from doing some of the
things that you want to do it&#39;s the
biggest thing people you know like
people online when they see me go
trending and all that stuff I&#39;ll get you
know tweets like I love Booga
you know okay yeah I&#39;m like no no it&#39;s
not impossible to answer all your
questions if you have tight funds
because it may make it an obstacle but
it does not make your questions any less
worth answering you deserve every you
deserve any you deserve everything in
the world all of you so how do you do it
you just have to work smart to fund your
aspirations whether it be skills or
traveling or sorry or like equipment or
anything just you have to work smart and
how I did it was that after I finished
culinary school and I realized I&#39;m not
gonna be a top chef I&#39;m not gonna become
a you know executive chef in some sort
of hotel I use the skills that I
garnered from culinary school and opened
up my macaron business you know they
even teach us marketing in that school
and entrepreneurship so you know we
learn things so I use that I apply that
at I made money besides that I also did
photography to shoot you know blog shops
for the catalogue and stuff like that
just kept on saving and saving and
saving and then finally I also I want to
tell you all that no job is too low or
too beneath you and you should never
think that any job is beneath you
I worked as a waitress for quite a while
in a French restaurant people who like
don&#39;t like Hey who&#39;s like come on like
I&#39;m a human being and if they would like
tip well over here we don&#39;t have a
tipping system but anyways but you know
no job is beneath you if you wanna if
you really want what you want even
working and like McDonald&#39;s or a mama
install should not stop you from funding
your aspirations you cannot be on a high
horse stay on the ground
you&#39;re alright on the ground and even
after being treated or mistreated by
like you know chefs in the kitchen or
like that&#39;s patrons in the restaurant it
was all still worth it because I saved
up that money and then I went traveling
I had so many questions what is America
like I wonder what people they&#39;re like
is it really like the movies I went I
pulled up a PowerPoint presentation for
my mother I said mom I want to go to
America she was like what I was like
look this is why because if you let me
stay here I don&#39;t know what I want to do
I&#39;m a culinary graduate but I&#39;m also a
photographer and I also do social media
but I don&#39;t feel like that&#39;s the rest of
my life I still have so many questions
please let me go she was like if you can
pay for yourself you know I was like
alright you know what I&#39;ll go do it so
saved all that money went traveling met
a bunch of my friends went to Boston and
stumbled upon Berklee College of Music
I&#39;m sorry and it was like Hogwarts for
musicians is that you know how would
they have once we also have one you know
the conducting baton so we I was like
wow this is going to be perfect for me I
don&#39;t know but you know I&#39;ll think about
it so I went home I came back to Cairo
and then Berkeley has been sneaky way of
following you if you go on their YouTube
then some may be like a little better
this is register now for Berklee College
of Music
get all your musical dreams right here
okay so I registered it was about like I
don&#39;t know 300 ringgit I have that saved
up I was like okay
alright if
get in nope if I don&#39;t get in it&#39;s okay
at least I tried if I do get in that
crap what never think about that later
laughs about all the money and stuff
like that but then I would be able to
call myself a musician so all of this
and I got it it all just started off but
like what if I click the register button
what if any even before that is that it
with what is America like and even
before that it started with I don&#39;t know
what it&#39;s like to travel at 20 you know
it&#39;s just question after question it&#39;s
like one thing leads to another and then
I pick up all these things all the way
and then when this when all when you try
out things there are gonna be things
that don&#39;t work out the way you plan it
do just fight my Australian story where
I went all the way there and came back
and like it just didn&#39;t work out but you
have to be positive because just
remember you know they say if it&#39;s like
it&#39;s never a mistake it&#39;s a lesson
learned and as cheesy as that sounds I
really believe that as well because
having been in Australia and having been
there for three months I learned some of
the culture I can come back here and
when I was trained people come here I
hold great conversations oh my god you
know like they&#39;re gonna be things to
talk about you&#39;re you&#39;re never gonna be
boring and it&#39;s like I don&#39;t know it&#39;s
knowledge it&#39;s miss damn it&#39;s just
you&#39;re gonna have a pool of conversation
to have with other people never regret
anything you do because even though you
spent money and time on that experience
that didn&#39;t work out it&#39;s still
knowledge even though it didn&#39;t
translate into skill you still get
something out of it you just gotta
remain positive and be motivated forever
and ever and ever like Jasmine was
saying that her motivation were her
grandparents and her inspiration like my
motivation to keep on working as you
know just a just a standalone woman is
my mother because she&#39;s a she&#39;s a single
she&#39;s a single woman she has three kids
we live in a nice house and she has had
no money support from anybody in the
world
well maybe a little bit for her parents
but not my
nobody else and she&#39;s like superwoman
and if it&#39;s anything my motivation I
don&#39;t care how I make the money but my
motivation is I want to be able to buy
her a house before she goes you know
what I mean
and before that like it doesn&#39;t matter
how I make the money as long as I make
it before she goes and then there&#39;s
gonna be stuff like if it&#39;s not for you
it&#39;s okay
because there are things that happen
where you try and you it doesn&#39;t happen
to you it doesn&#39;t happen for you and you
get demotivated is that a word you just
you know you lose motivation and you
should know that it&#39;s alright don&#39;t
worry about it
I learned this a lot through auditioning
like when I auditioned for a certain
part and I know that I can&#39;t do it but
they tell you no we don&#39;t need you
it&#39;s okay because sometimes that one
time I audition for uh what was it I
think it was Annie in good thing
Highlands they had like all the orphan
kids they had us all line up in a
straight line
I had already passed the singing
audition so why do maybe I I can see
right but I was too tall it&#39;s like if
the part is not for you they&#39;re just not
gonna need you and then you&#39;re gonna be
like you know what it&#39;s okay maybe I&#39;ll
be for somebody else so remember if
you&#39;re not good at anything like if you
come to be you know come to terms that
you&#39;re let&#39;s say you&#39;re not good at golf
for example which was me I try that out
ones do didn&#39;t work out too much yeah
anyways if you&#39;re not good at that there
are still a hundred things in the world
that you are good you could be good at
all you have to do is go out there and
look for it and it all starts with a
question so remember that all of this
curiosity that I went through that
brought me to all these bases is all on
myself I want you to move you know to be
inspired to make that money and then
find that time and ask those questions
and at the same time practice good
energy the bad things don&#39;t work out
channel that anger and that
disappointment into creating new things
or into the next thing just keep on
moving forward I&#39;ll be great and I want
well I&#39;m almost done so I&#39;m
gonna say that I&#39;m gonna offer you a
place to give me your first question
asked a question today I know we&#39;re
gonna have refreshments after this so if
you want to ask me anything in
particular about any feel that I have
explored into whether it be photography
music or cooking or scuba diving also so
on and so forth come and ask me your
first question of the day and we&#39;ll get
talking and let&#39;s spark that idea within
you so you can be curious and explore
discover yourself thank you
[Applause]
