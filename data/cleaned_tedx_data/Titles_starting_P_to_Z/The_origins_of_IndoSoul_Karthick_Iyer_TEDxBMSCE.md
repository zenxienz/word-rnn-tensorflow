hi everyone I&#39;m pure I&#39;m Catholic iron
and I&#39;m going to talk about the story of
endo so there are three parts to this
talk
first I&#39;d like to talk a little bit
about the bud of inner soul and then I&#39;d
like to go on and sort of explain I try
and unravel some of the key facets of a
music and third I&#39;d like to play a song
from our album and also looking with him
to look beyond to talk about the burthen
in your soul I&#39;d like to go back five
six years when I was playing with some
of the top contemporary Indian balance
in India at the time I was in pretty
well because we had a very hectic
touring schedule week in and week out
there were concerts and every other
month of you were going to a different
country playing it was pretty great for
a musician at the age of 25
it seemed like everything was sorted but
however I always felt like there was
something missing
because when with the experience and the
exposure I have been playing all these
wonderful artists I sort of started to
gather an idea of what an ideal mix of
Indian classical music which I have been
learning all my life I which I really
love and western music could be and for
me I had a formula which I thought was
just perfect and I used to make my own
music so one fine day I decided to quit
my job as a pronounced musician and went
back to Chennai and
to stop my own band and make my own
music so I got together with some of my
friends and from timeless musical
background some from rock and some from
fanatic some from pop and we decided to
stop a band in the first concert ended
up being a wedding at my own sister&#39;s
wedding reception the concert started we
prepared and the concert started and
attended it was a great success
I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t know that the audience
being my own relatives would be little
tiny but considering that this was the
first concert together and the fresh set
up position
it was quite infinity and so Nina much
only one spread and we started playing
more and more concerts and what happened
was this as the musicians started
getting to know each other better you
know he sang 20 together and we started
to understand where he came from you
know musically also a little bit better
and compositions that we were making at
the practice sessions started to you
know and started to improve and you warm
on its own and each song much different
from the other what was sure was sort of
a unique sound that was there to our
compositions and about a couple of VMs
to do two and a half years after I
started the valley we had a set of
sounds ready to release the album on the
other end of the spectrum the responses
that we were getting on YouTube Facebook
and SoundCloud to our music was beyond
my wildest dreams there were people who
are talking about how our music had a
calming
then but how it helped them get fastest
troubles in their life there were a lot
of students who don&#39;t we&#39;ll be talking
about how it helped them get through the
stress and the rigors of examination
there were even new mothers who are not
talking about how their two and three
year old would you know instantly stop
crying or would co-operate and have a
listen to music and this is also this is
out there on my youtube pages if you
look at our YouTube videos you can see
all these comments so we started to
realize and it was becoming increasingly
apparent that we were having a good I
think our audience and how music was
special so we had all the ingredients
you know to go release our album we have
the music the songs ready and we have a
good support from the audience as well
the only thing that we needed was a name
to call us names that have been floated
around like fusion music like word music
but I thought you know our music
demanded something that was a little bit
more specific and we needed something
that would sort of talk about the
merging of genre that was made possible
by the meeting of minds between
musicians from diverse musical culture I
need some music that was soulful and had
a very good effect on our listeners
across the board so we thought long and
hard and thus the term you know so was
born before I here&#39;s the CD cover for
album we released this last July and you
can see my decisions
vikrum ROM loving swimming along with
myself we are posting against against a
wall in Pondicherry where this photo was
taken before I play you one of our songs
I&#39;d like to sort of unravel this music a
little bit and see what the key facets
or windows soul are that make it take
and I can think of two facets one is the
merging of genres one is that the
merging of genres is means to an end
and then itself and the other one is the
spirit of collaboration that is very key
to a new soul but we&#39;re talking about
the merging of genres all of us would
agree that any contemporary Indian
fusion music for that matter always has
a merging of genres between Indian music
and a western genre but it was all the
key difference is that this merging is a
means to an end not an end in itself to
sort of elaborate this further I could
say that the fulfillment of wind or soul
lies not in showcasing this merging but
rather and trying to be as invisible as
possible and then when men when the
merging becomes really subtle what
happens is that the story of the song
remains the story of the song and the
song doesn&#39;t try and say oh listen a
Carnatic music about rock music and I&#39;m
mix them both and it&#39;s very cool because
I think we are moving to the next step
in the evolution of Indian classical
contemporary music where the merging has
to sort of you know becomes subtle it
has upon the back layer which will
create a unique sound
yes but the story or whatever the
composer wants to express being to the
story or be just a manatee or a blue but
even in emotion if he wants to just show
the people that he&#39;s happy and he wants
to make a song about him that should be
at the forefront and me to make this
happen in my experience by trying to
express and explore the commonalities
that exist between two different genres
rather than trying to look at the
differences and trying to bridge them
and what happens in this case is that
the blend between the John has become
much more natural not forced one more
easy way to make this happen
leads me to my second point that&#39;s the
first point of course and the second
point is the spirit of collaboration I&#39;d
like to tell you a share with you an
interesting experience that I had with
my band emergence
when I was 22 I was invited by the
Honourable based band
to go play for them and what started
then ended up in a long and fruitful
partnership that continues to this day
but at that point of time I was 22 and I
just got in a huge condom Indian music
so I was faced with four musicians from
different parts of the world coming from
different musical cultures and I had no
idea was I was excited but I was also
intimidated at the same time I have no
idea what was expected out of me and I
have no idea what I will play and it
about took me a whole year for me to
start to feel comfortable with the music
and after a year probably
I started to feel like I really hold my
part as the Indian element in the mix
and this process of organically
developing one&#39;s music with time and
we&#39;ll get into know musicians and we&#39;re
getting to know what where they come
from many other sort of synergy between
the musicians for me it was one of the
biggest takeaways that I had from
working with emergence and I sort of use
this experience to morning know so to be
what it is today
this cookie in this zone is not
short-term it&#39;s not something that looks
after immediate results later is it safe
music it&#39;s um it&#39;s a long-term music
that releases from the meeting of minds
of musicians from different cultures and
the more the musicians meet and start to
understand and appreciate each other&#39;s
music and gemstones the richer and
deeper the music gets so now I&#39;d like to
go from going beyond the music to the
music
I&#39;d like you to I&#39;d like to play a song
from our album Indo so looking within to
the beyond unfortunately I couldn&#39;t have
my musicians here with me so what I&#39;ve
done is I&#39;ve taken the audio and the
video from our launch performers so
you&#39;re going to see my musicians
performing on the screen and with the
audio are just muted the violin and I&#39;m
going to be playing the wide range
life for you so I&#39;d like to come to this
talk by saying that this album and also
looking within look beyond is the first
step in indoor soul because we are
working on a second album right now and
already that sounding so much different
from the first one and I look forward to
taking many much more many many more
steps in this revolution and taking
Indian classical music to many uncharted
territories thank you very much
