the inclusive mosque initiative was
started by two queer Muslim women
d&#39;oeuvre wanted a space where she didn&#39;t
have to separate from her son at the
mosque having to leave him alone and
unsupervised in the men&#39;s section
Tim Sela had to experience her mother be
denied a space to pray because in her
final days of life she had become a
wheelchair user and was unable to get up
a flight of stairs to the women&#39;s
section I grew up a fairly privileged
Brown Muslim woman in London and found
that I could fit into most mosque and
Muslim spaces in fact for me
Muslim spaces were safer spaces in my
post 9/11 world they were free of the
racism and stigma a young woman in a
headscarf often experiences but as I
grew older I started to see the
oppressions within those faces the ideas
I had about Islam elevating women that I
had seen in the powerful women I grew up
around and in the stories I had read was
not what I was saying in my experiences
at my London University the Islamic
Society held up levels of gender
segregation that meant that even at
annual general meetings sisters asked to
sit at the back and told not to speak
but passed notes to the brothers in
leadership at the front at my local
mosque I was elected to the committee
the only woman elected to the mosque
committee but I was relegated to taking
minutes and organizing women only
activities in 2008 in my second year at
university dr. Armond our dude came to
the UK to lead a mixed gender prayer
she&#39;s in the middle of this picture I
watched that prayer from afar half
horrified half spellbound you see Muslim
prayer or Salah is really a very simple
anyone can lead a prayer you just have
to know how to pray but the leadership
of a Muslim woman of a mixed gender
prayer is considered sacrilegious even
though no specific rules deny her
leadership
she has simply been written out of the
practice with words like modesty and
decency used to keep it that way
even though the Prophet Muhammad peace
be upon him was known unto at least one
occasion to have asked a woman to lead a
mixed gender prayer in her home
witnessing that radical act threw me
into deep introspection I began to read
the works of feminist Muslim writers
reading feminist readers of the Quran
commentaries on sexual ethics and
Islamic law reading the tales of their
struggles more and more I began to see a
disconnect in my ideals of Justice of
God&#39;s justice and the lived realities of
the community I was living amongst dr.
Armand OA deed formulated the to--he
dick model toe he&#39;d in Arabic means
oneness and so toe he&#39;d is the idea that
God is one but unlike the patriarchal
model where God&#39;s Authority is mediated
via men the toe he dick model stipulates
a God that is single genderless deity
but with an undivided society underneath
the principle of toe he&#39;d then
safeguards against hegemony oppression
and hierarchy and creates society where
everyone is together and enables
relations of social justice harmony and
equality so in 2010 when that radical
act was repeated when another Muslim
woman came to the UK to lead a mixed
gender prayer I was ready to pray behind
her
I remember standing in the rows with
other men and women behind this woman
and crying and crying during that prayer
it was one of the most profound
spiritual experiences of my life this
was a woman just like me that I could
speak to after the prayer that I could
hold that I could acknowledge for
leading me and others my whole concept
of what it was to be a Muslim woman
shifted it was one thing to read about
the tohi dick model and learn about it
in books but it was quite another to
experience it in the community practice
after that prayer I felt at a complete
loss with the existing spaces in my
community I didn&#39;t know how I was going
to find that special connection to the
divine again how that female spiritual
leadership was going to be established
in a UK context lucky for me a few years
later I met Tim sealer and d&#39;oeuvre ler
who I talked about at the beginning they
shared with me their vision for the
inclusive mosque initiative a space
where Dudley wouldn&#39;t have to separate
from her son to pray wet Encinas mother
if she was still alive today could
access the prayer space where the
spiritual leadership of Muslim women
would be centered where black and brown
bodies would be safe where visible and
non-visible disabilities would never be
a barrier to participation so in 2012
the inclusive mosque initiative was
created and that December at our first
prayer meeting I got to lead the prayer
our space has been in existence for five
years now and every year more and more
people come to join with us and to pray
with us but we don&#39;t just do prayer we
run workshops and discussions on mental
health racism ableism we talk about
toxic masculinity the space of X Muslims
we run soup kitchens and musical events
and recently we started a support group
for the family members of LGBT Qi people
we cry we exist and we grow as the chair
of the inclusive mosque initiative I can
tell you the inner space that is
inclusive of all there is great joy and
healing just like the joy I felt in
praying behind a woman in mom for the
first time doing that alongside others
you build relationships of trust and
growth and friendship you find the
wholeness of yourself that you thought
you liked but it&#39;s not without its
difficulties in a space that exists to
overcome oppression and privilege there
are challenges to make sure that every
voice is heard so just like at home when
your mom tells you to get your act
together our space does that too it lets
you center yourself
but then question who you have
marginalized in order to be centered and
so the leadership of Muslim women is
important but what of the leadership of
black Muslim women who are often
sidelined and their narratives
marginalized in place the normative
Muslim who is Arab or South Asian like
me and so because I don&#39;t just want to
Center myself here are the stories of
some of the people in the inclusive
Moscow initiative ome Leila says I feel
safe seen and accepted at any Emmy space
as a Muslim bisexual woman I have never
found comfort within the walls of a
traditional mosque ami made me realize
that Islam is definitely not a monolith
and if I don&#39;t have to endure misogyny
and queer phobia for the sake of
spirituality I get a sense of belonging
and home at IMI&#39;s it is so wonderful to
have a space where people can be who
they are and where people can discuss
issues without the feeling of being
ashamed I feel a sense of comfort with
Amy that I do not feel in other spaces
the people there a great company great
friends and non judgmental towards
others rather than having one Imam with
one perspective amy has given me a whole
group of Imams all with different
knowledge and experience or expertise
amy has taught me more about diversity
than any other training program or form
of learning I have increased my
knowledge of what being inclusive really
is and this makes me feel closer to God
than anything else the fisa our space
exists against the backdrop of a broader
socio-political context no one can
escape the fact that Muslims suffer
increasingly from Islamophobia in
Britain today research and statistics
show that Muslim groups are one of the
most marginalised and impoverished
groups in this country when the identity
of Muslims is approached from a binary
is set up there&#39;s a narrative that
wishes to portray some Muslims as good
Muslims and some Muslims as bad Muslims
that narrative only marginalizes the
entire community even further our
organization is often approached by
media outlets who want to know about the
work we do but more specifically about
the reactions of other
Muslims our Muslim oppressors because
only interesting and newsworthy when
Muslims are the victims of other Muslims
you see painting a picture of a
misogynistic patriarchal homophobic bad
Muslims only feeds into the narrative of
government policies like prevent that
wish that traumatizes entire groups of
Muslim people no media outlet is
interested in the fact that our biggest
challenge is finding accessible and
cheap spaces in London where a Muslim
group will even be allowed to pray well
that most of the people in a me are more
concerned about right-wing fascism and
racism that my biggest fear is for my
hijab wearing mother that she comes home
safely after she&#39;s been out and about in
London Muslims and Muslim women who
choose not to pray in mixed gendered
congregations or pray behind women Imams
and not somehow in need of reform the
mosques and Muslim organizations that
exist in this country
that I talked about earlier have a story
to tell too they experience struggles
and hardships and I don&#39;t wish to
stigmatize the work that they have done
and are still doing
they are the spaces of our parents our
siblings and our friends feminism exists
in these spaces to the Muslim community
is full of strong brilliant Muslim women
we see ourselves as part of the
landscape of the UK mosque experience
our space isn&#39;t a space where liberal
values or Western values have won at the
expense of Islamic or Muslim values our
stories and narratives as Muslim people
is one of struggle and resistance we
center ourselves first and foremost in
the region of Islam and the book of the
Holy Quran we&#39;re not ashamed of that
fact we don&#39;t need saving from anyone
and we&#39;re not your poster child for
brawl progressive British Islam so when
you hear the story of a space like ours
don&#39;t hold it up in contrast to all the
other Muslim stories you&#39;ve heard about
reject that binary Muslims come from
every background every class racial
identity sect sexual orientation
disability there are different levels of
traditionalism and religious practice we
do good and bad and boring things and we
shouldn&#39;t have to always humanize
ourselves thank you
