for as long as I can remember I&#39;ve loved
words when I was 9 I found Kent 10 in
China for the final round in every show
is the countdown conundrum a nine-letter
anagram to be solved on the buzzer
inside 30 seconds as the years pass
watching this every week I became
fascinated by the sheer number of these
nine letter words in the English
language prototype landscape tarantula
marmalade tonight I want to talk about
possibly the biggest 9 that a word of
all happiness happiness is a concept
that has occupied the minds of our
greatest thinkers for thousands of years
everyone from Aristotle to Gandhi it
made the code for the American
Declaration of Independence but even
there it&#39;s frustratingly out of reach
the pursuit of happiness who am I to
talk about happiness I&#39;m not a doctor
psychologist or scientist but for years
I had no idea of what happiness was I
lived every day between a past I
couldn&#39;t change and a future I couldn&#39;t
control eventually this mentality sucked
me into darkness while outwardly I
presented a happy exterior everywhere
from empty churches to Starbucks toilets
became a refuge for my tears I was
diagnosed with depression three years
ago what is depression to me depression
was a dense gray fog that settled over
every single thing every single day
it brought a complete lack of clarity
direction energy motivation eventually
that could predict a very posh and a
complete lack of self-worth and in a
country where 1 in 12 people deal with
depression at any one time where there
are 2 million prescriptions for
antidepressants written every year I
felt so alone talking to doctors and
counselors helped but when I left those
rooms I reacted the veneer for ones bad
off work the doctor sir tread gas
stroe enteritis because he said no one
would question gastroenteritis I had
agreed to - it was essential to me that
no one knew antidepressants were
recommended but they didn&#39;t feel right
for me for one it felt much too quick
the prescription was written inside 10
minutes for another while there were
many many days I felt that the world was
certainly no better off for having me in
it I wasn&#39;t actively suicidal no
antidepressants might treat the symptoms
but I needed to find a cause my
breakthrough came with one small
positive step a challenge from my wife
Lorraine during one extended depressive
episode to do one thing to take a shower
every morning for a week I managed it
this showed me that action was possible
and that action got results so I decided
to examine all the actions of my life
and all the choices choices that lay
behind those actions I believe that it&#39;s
very difficult for us when we&#39;re feeling
low to get up in the morning and just
choose to be happy but I also feel that
our choices have a massive bearing on
our happiness one of my choices was
about depression that I must be hidden
but I realized that hiding the problem
was doing very little to solve it so I
started to talk a strange thing happened
suddenly I wasn&#39;t alone suddenly
conversations were happening everywhere
many of them weren&#39;t men who had felt
the same way as I had and like me hadn&#39;t
been able to express it and I found in
these honest conversations the most
powerful drug I&#39;ve ever known now I&#39;m
grateful every single day I&#39;m grateful
to have found new friendships all over
the world I&#39;m grateful to have the
strength in my legs to stand here and
strengthen my lungs to speak and I
realized that happiness is so much less
about having and so much more about
doing and being and every day what we do
and who we are our choices Netflix or
one extra hour of sleep
worrying about tomorrow or committing
100% to be in the moment today being the
person that people expect you to be or
finding out who you really are and being
yourself
and I think if we can just commit to a
series of small positive choices we
might find some more 9 that are words we
might find that we can be more authentic
that we can have more integrity that we
can give more enjoyment and maybe
experience happiness thank you
