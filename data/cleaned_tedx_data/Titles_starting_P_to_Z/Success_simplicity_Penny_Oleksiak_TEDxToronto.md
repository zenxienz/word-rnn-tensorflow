little exhausted a little tired you&#39;re
not too fit Rimmer hasn&#39;t you&#39;re pretty
good in the pool okay yeah you can swim
fast pretty fast yeah I&#39;ve been
practicing for a while so my hopes are
high nice
so you&#39;re 17 and you&#39;re in school and
you&#39;re cutting right now
what do you should you be doing not here
on this stage where should you be you&#39;re
at a school young lady
I should be in bio class in bio yes be
doing bio right now are you a good
student I&#39;m pretty good student I think
my parents would say I am I think I
sometimes it a little attached to my
phone but I&#39;m getting off that so
attached to your phone a little bit
are you a good multitasker can you do
math and check snapchat I can like write
notes on snapchat my friends are like
checking my Twitter gotcha it&#39;s you&#39;re a
good student it distracted know I try my
best
what&#39;s a day in the life like of penny
Schwimmer a day in my life
it&#39;s pretty busy it&#39;s really non-stop

and kind of starts around 6:00 in the
morning I wake up and I&#39;ll have some
breakfast and then my dad will drive me
either to the subway station or just to
practice and I&#39;ll go first swim in the
morning and then right after I saw him I
walk to the weights room where I wasn&#39;t
do weights there and then after I&#39;m done
my weights there then I&#39;ll walk to
school and then at school I work from

like 1:11 to like 4:00 and then I walk
back to the pool then I practiced there
then I go home then I have dinner then I
have homework then I probably like
shower then I pack my bags for tomorrow
and the same thing hmm so you&#39;re not
getting much done in any given day huh
no now when you go to the pool for a
swim like I go to the pool first women
it&#39;s a lot of this you know a little hot
tub laying around
like what are you doing in the pool um
usually like six or seven kilometers in
the pool per practice so that&#39;s like two
hours and it can be some fast stuff
which I really enjoy I like going fast
and just like doing races basically the
pool but some days it&#39;s just like ten
four hundredths and don&#39;t have fun and
be in your head and don&#39;t talk like mmm
do you like swimming oh shit that&#39;s crap
and I don&#39;t want to ask a question
Mateos ass but I meet so many amazing
people and right now I&#39;m like back on my
old club so I&#39;m just having a lot of fun
so you&#39;re back with the home club you&#39;re
not you&#39;re not swimming with the
national team at the moment no I&#39;m not
something at the High Performance Center
and Scarborough anymore right now that
University of Toronto downtown and I&#39;m
training with like Kylie Moss and I&#39;m
training with all the people I trained
with a few years ago and it&#39;s just it&#39;s
so fun right do you find now that you
have so much faster than they are so
you&#39;re getting soft training with them I
mean are they pushing you pressing
questions I think that in practice I
kind of need to like pick up what I&#39;m
doing more because I know I&#39;m a very
very good racer but I&#39;ve always kind of
just held back in practice and kind of
just done the practice but I think
having a bigger team is helping push me
forward and pushing me to the beat but
the best that I can in practice so I
think it&#39;s definitely helped there yeah
they probably love having you back to
your friends you like to swim with
that&#39;s neat that you&#39;d say that you&#39;re
lame at practice but a better racer and
they push you at practice and maybe you
can help them be better racers why what
is it about you you jump in the pool and
the race is on why does that seem to
make a difference for you because I
think I just have fun when I&#39;m racing
it&#39;s just so fun to like get it and
compete and see what you can do and like
at the end of my race when I&#39;m trying to
go the fast as fast as I can I&#39;m just
looking to see who am i passing like who
can I pass right now and it&#39;s just so
fun to just like get in there and go as
fast as you can and touch the wall and
just like be dead for like a minute and
that&#39;s fun yeah do you like to suffer I
love that if that&#39;s like you know that&#39;s
a great character just like at the end
of the race you know like you know you
put everything into it when you&#39;re
touching the wall and you&#39;re just
holding onto the wall and you&#39;re like I
don&#39;t even care what I just came right
now like I could have come 10th in an
eight-person race and I&#39;d be happy like
I don&#39;t care like I just I&#39;m done and
the thing for you is the totality of
that effort it&#39;s like you&#39;re obsessed
with the outcome knowing that I&#39;m trying
my best
god I don&#39;t lose that hey that&#39;s so good
good reminder to all of us if you could
go back and have a conversation with pre
real penny which is what would you tell
her um I think I just tell her to stay
the same and do what she&#39;s doing because
I think pre real I had a really really
good support team and I still do now but
just having that team there to tell me
just go there have fun like you have no
pressure you&#39;re not gonna win medals
you&#39;re not gonna make finals I was like
yes I can but I think that was kind of
the attitude I had to have going into
Rio mm-hmm we could we could spend an
hour here but we got to keep our track
on time is fabulous
can you teach me to swim yeah cuz I&#39;m
just like um I&#39;m fresh out of the Cirque
de Soleil so I didn&#39;t think it may be
good you could think he could teach me
to swim
uh what&#39;s coming up for you you&#39;re in
grade 12 now and I guess Ontario doesn&#39;t
do 13 anymore it&#39;s a week so what&#39;s
gonna have you graduate this year
no I took a semester off before we go
and then I kind of took a semester off
last year before world so swimming was
kind of just like number one priority
but right now it&#39;s just like you need to
focus on school and swimming at the same
time so I have to do a fifth year after
this
then I&#39;m probably gonna take another
year off before Tokyo and then after
Tokyo and hopefully University I don&#39;t
know where yet though I&#39;m so long
what would you study if you got there
when sorry penny when you get there
hopefully law well I&#39;m interested in
that that&#39;s cool I&#39;m gonna be a
litigator or corporate lawyer you want
to sue people and getting up in court
and kick ass or what do you think
[Music]
criminal law really I never want to see
you in court or be lose immediately I&#39;m
sure yeah
this idea of legacy that we&#39;re talking
about here at this conference it seems
kind of a crazy question
right 17 years old so what&#39;s your legacy
penny if it&#39;s almost a little unfair but
what&#39;s your legacy penny it&#39;s so hard to
like think about I always think about it
for so long I&#39;m like you guys asked me
to partake in the talk and I think my
legacy is hopefully just to like inspire
younger generations if not like just
younger girls just young people in
general to like get out there and do
what they want to do because I feel like
people can like relate to me just
because we&#39;re so close in age and I
don&#39;t have the same daily routines as
like other kids but like for the most
part I do I guess so
I just want to be able to like be there
for kids to relate to and be there for
kids to look up to and I guess that&#39;s
what my mm-hmm
is it that relatability because you are
so young relatively speaking that they
can see wow you know you&#39;re only eight
or nine years older than I am and there
you are yeah I think so yeah cause like
I know especially for me when I look up
to like models or like other athletes
and Canadian athletes like eugenie
bouchard and people I&#39;m always like that
is so far away even though it&#39;s like I&#39;m
kind of in that moment
hmm um but I think for just looking at
myself I&#39;m like oh I&#39;m just a kid I&#39;m
just I love so big I look school I love
what I&#39;m doing so I think it&#39;s just easy
for other kids early to write when you
get it when you go to them and thank you
for that and hope you I&#39;m sure you know
I mean you&#39;re so humble and shucks about
it which is lovely
but I like this contrast of you get in
the pool
you&#39;re a closer you&#39;re known to be a
closer it&#39;s fun you know you&#39;re good I
mean relative to a dolphin you suck as a
swimmer
but relative to other humans on the
planet you&#39;re really good and I like
this idea that you&#39;d this simplicity
this the lightness of being that you
bring to being just really good and it&#39;s
so inspiring and invigorating I love it
what&#39;s the deal at the pool when you&#39;re
just always like with your clap with
your goggles like all the swimmers like
just constantly what are you trying to
like shove them into your head what&#39;s
the deal with that cause like I don&#39;t
really like my cap being too tight I&#39;m
like that&#39;s right but like yeah I think
people just like want to make sure that
no water is getting into their goggles
whatsoever like life or death it&#39;s like
whatever happens in the pool their
goggles are not gonna go off even if it
sucks your eyeball out of your head
because after you win you&#39;re like you&#39;re
looking around trying to see your
results but you can&#39;t because your
eyeballs falling out of your head have
you ever had them like fill up with
water
yeah I was the last leg of the relay for
4x2 and I dove in and Michael was filled
up right away and I was freaking out I
was like oh my goodness like I&#39;m gonna
cost these girls this medal like I can&#39;t
like lose this race so the ball like I
don&#39;t know where I am
I don&#39;t like I can&#39;t see anyone else at
the pool so I was like I&#39;m just gonna
swim as fast I can for four lengths and
see what happens and then I touch the
wall and we came third so just like that
so you jumped in the pool immediately
your goggles fill up with water
you couldn&#39;t see a thing and you said
well I&#39;m just gonna go as fast as I can
the world according to penny it&#39;s like
what are you worried about Just Swim
your face off and get win a militant
medal it&#39;s pretty fabulous I think that
race is like I&#39;ve never felt that much
pain ever in my life in any single race
after like other than that do you think
if you hadn&#39;t hadn&#39;t messed up the
goggles you might have paced yourself
but honestly I don&#39;t know sometimes like
I used to talk about that with my coach
and he&#39;d be like I feel like if you your
goggles didn&#39;t fill up you would have
like pasted yourself off someone they
would have like Oh touched you or
something like that but I don&#39;t know so
you had a moment of terror oh my god
yeah and then just bit down and went I
tried to yeah well it seemed to work you
did a pretty nice job of it you know I
want to just ask a quick question about
your training because you you glossed
over it and it&#39;s very very demanding I
want to ask a little quick question
about your fuel like can you are you
still at that age where you eat anything
and it doesn&#39;t matter or are you
thinking as an athlete you TD eat
properly or more healthfully bagels I
don&#39;t know cake every day but like cake
okay but I think now it&#39;s more like I&#39;m
figuring out I need to eat healthier and
nutrition is actually gonna help me with
my living and gonna help me like I like
to figure out when I go to sleep because
I used to be I&#39;ll go to bed it to and

wake up at 5:00 like no issue but now
it&#39;s a complete 180 and I&#39;m trying to
figure well you&#39;re getting older penny
and get serious about God helped the
world when you get unit ition nutrition
dialed in people are in trouble if
you&#39;re gonna cheat what do you cheat on
what&#39;s that little thing you see am I
gonna what are you gonna eat are we
talking like just Gerber d.o from a
McDonald&#39;s Wendy&#39;s sorry to plug them
they&#39;re not a sponsor but anyway really
a frosty and some chicken fingers
that is your I have a bad day or
something my mom will be like it&#39;s okay
I got you chicken fingers and a frosty
for dinner and I&#39;m like yeah it&#39;s the
way to your heart foods the way to my
heart - yeah chicken fingers we talked
before in passing about the training and
you and you talked abut so you get in
the pool and you swim and you have a
workout and then you go do the weight
workout yeah and what is that are you
just like what order what is a weight
training session look like after
swimming 50 kilometres if you follow me
on insta no it&#39;s just a really hard
weight session my trainer right now he&#39;s
pretty tough so like I&#39;ll like do one
weight next one week and then the next
week he&#39;ll be like okay we&#39;re just gonna
do a weight that&#39;s like 10 kilos heavier
20 feet over and I&#39;m like okay and then
always text me being like you can&#39;t say
I&#39;ll try you have to say I&#39;m gonna do it
like he&#39;s teaching me how to be like
more aggressive in the weight room so I
can lift bigger weights but I&#39;m not like
the most aggressive person so you like
to be laid-back about it yeah pretty
chill I&#39;m learning to be more aggressive
in the way Airmen like slap the weights
yeah banging some shit around God drop
stuff from a great distance don&#39;t lay it
down and everybody will draw their woo
that penny she&#39;s bad that&#39;s kind of
obnoxious don&#39;t do it I don&#39;t think you
should
I do that kind of thing it&#39;s like
doesn&#39;t even make a sound i tropic
that&#39;s it you probably drop the weight
and like when you take the weight off
you like slap it back where it goes so
you&#39;re this wonderful contrast between
quite laid-back outside of the pool but
then when you dip in the water something
goes yeah I think you kind of have to
have that contrast you can&#39;t just always
be like all the time like you have to
kind of have like got a chill out at
home and like kind of get your mind off
things so you can do other stuff with
your life because if I was always just
tense all the time I feel like you&#39;re
just me you got a lot of wisdom packed
up in your life penny thank you for
sharing with us today
ladies gentleman
[Applause]
