my name is Marcus Hartman and I would
like you to close your eyes and I want
you to picture the most influential
powerful thoughtful informative mentors
and advocates in your life and I want
you to zoom in on zoom in zoom in now
get down to those ones who are really
really really really important in your
life and I want you to picture like
they&#39;re right in front of you reach your
hand out tall and I want you to
challenge them to a dance-off no double
double keep your eyes closed I want you
to picture them as if they&#39;re right here
and I want you to tell you tell them
thank you you can open your eyes so the
question I get asked the most besides
how tall are you
and are you the guy from The Blind Side
is why I get that one a lot is why why
do you do advocacy the how and the why
behind mentorship so I want to think
about this a little bit and reframe
we&#39;ve heard a lot of great things about
a lot of great mentors and powerful
people I want to shift our narrative
from mentorship to advocacy a mentor his
relationship of hire who will kind of
top down and which a more experienced or
more knowledgeable person helps to guide
and they&#39;re less experienced or less
knowledgeable person but an advocate an
advocate is someone who fights for
something or someone especially someone
who fights for the rights of others and
so it was actually been in my practice
that I&#39;ve moved from a mentor to an
advocate so who needs an advocate well
everybody needs an advocate Josh Shipp
says every kid is one carrying the dog
away from being a success story so we
know from the adverse childhood
experiences studies we know from trauma
and resilience and you know from
restorative justice that all it takes is
one adult to shift the life of a student
what are advocates we&#39;re advocates
Service mirrors so young people can see
themselves in someone else and advocacy
services windows that&#39;s people who they
can see themselves through and our young
people can see themselves through to
their best selves advocates help in
safe you know coming generations and so
right now II just have a seamless plug
all of us here right now are in the work
of being advocates we want to do the
work to learn more about how to get
better about saving upcoming generations
so advocacy is personal so as you can
see this is a younger much more
patterned version of myself to the left
my grandmother one of my greatest
advocates in the top right corner

my mom holding me at 2:00 I&#39;m not five
years old in that picture and then a
young and then me at 18 with a mock neck
and a wonderful necklace from Pearson
pagoda probably with my father there
there in the picture this version of me
did not know the things that he would
need later on in life I had some
wonderful family advocates a great
network of people that really pushed and
move me but there&#39;s an only child
growing up and in South Seattle
there were people and things that I
wanted and wanting to learn from one to
learn how to be a better man and a
better person and so I was searching my
whole life for an advocate so it was my
pleasure and my privilege to introduce
to each and every one of you my advocate
Batman now I know I know you&#39;re saying
well how was Batman your advocate well
again I mention the only child and if
your only child you know you have an
active imagination so growing up I loved
Batman and I said growing up like it&#39;s
not still an issue it may be if I win a
lot of money I may become Batman myself
however my advocate at a young age was
Batman and what I as a kid I wanted to
be bad when I wanted to be a hero I
wanted to be a person who stood up for
the rights of others and who also had a
lot of money however what I learned as
I&#39;ve grown is that Batman while he was
my mentor at the time the person I
actually really wanted to be liked was
Alfred Alfred is one of the world&#39;s
greatest advocates if you know the
mythology of Batman you know Alfred
raised Bruce from a young age he took a
man he was there for him as a youth he
was there for him when he became Batman
he supported him through crime fighting
and everything else and bringing in
other people and he&#39;s always Batman&#39;s
greatest champion fighting crime with
him in fact sometimes fighting crime for
him and so Alfred served as a really a
benchmark for me growing up as an
advocate what does advocacy take
mistakes will the training is nothing
the will does everything and most
importantly the will to act we have to
be willing to act if you&#39;re gonna be a
powerful advocate in that state up here
is a young man who I&#39;ve had the
privilege to advocate for his name&#39;s
Ramon and his mother Nora and that
picture is from after the first ever
restorative justice healing circle for a
felony case Ramon about two years ago I
got a phone call from his mother and she
said he had found himself in a lot of
trouble where he found himself facing 18
to 52 months in juvenile detention for
for a crime that he was a part of and
she needed some help I had mentored and
advocated for his older brother I didn&#39;t
really have a relationship with Ramon
but when she made the call I had to go
and so I went and I met with Ramon and
we kind of talked about him as like I
don&#39;t know what I&#39;m gonna do for this
kid cuz this is a really big thing he
could be spending the rest of his young
life juvenile life in jail and so it
just so happened a couple of weeks later
I found myself in the juvenile court
house with some judges and some
prosecuting attorneys and defense
attorneys and we were at the table and I
looked over to my right and there was a
prosecuting attorney Jimmy hung and we
were at the table when we were talking
about utilizing the first ever
restorative circle we&#39;re sort of healing
circle for a felony case and we&#39;re like
man we need the perfect case and I
tapped Jimmy on the shoulder and I said
I think I might have the perfect case
and I didn&#39;t know if it was the perfect
case with what I did know is I believed
in Ramon and I knew that spending that
much time in jail was not gonna benefit
his life his family or the legacy of
greatness that he had within him so fast
forward about four months later we&#39;re in
the courthouse the process is begun
we&#39;ve done the first hearing with the
judge transformative in a way that was
very different we invited community
people came in and so afterwards we were
sitting with the prosecuting attorney
the defense attorney judge st. Clair in
front of us and we&#39;re going around and
talking in the judge ass Ramon well who
was Marcos to you and he was like that&#39;s
my advocate I was like yeah I am I am
his advocate in the connection between
Ramona and I the first thing that I
learned besides that he was an
incredible young man worth advocating
for was that we were both huge fans of
professional wrestling
and so and
taking all judgment aside the art of
professional wrestling is awesome so
that was our connection and so it
actually made a lot more sense to me
when he called me as advocate
[Applause]
and it is the greatest privilege of my
career to serve as the advocate for the
beast I was gonna black in my eye to
really make the moment stick but you get
the point of the deep level of advocacy
that it took and for Ramone to call me
his advocate in our connection through
wrestling it was so powerful and I was
like yeah I want to be your advocate
advocacy and action looks like this a
year later after a hundred and twenty
hours of circle after numerous numerous
court dates Ramone sat with myself
Justin Clare amongst others and a
community packed full of people who were
there to support this first-ever
occasion to then talk about the impact
that it had on his life and instead of
serving that time in jail what he did
instead was healed he healed with the
victim he here with the family healed
with his own family the community
through through circle through letters
of apology and through sitting through
the process and actually having to
really grow himself and instead of doing
52 months in jail Ramone did a year of
probation but in that year probation his
work was to actually lead more healing
circles for other young people they came
behind him and in the process he learned
so much more about himself and I&#39;m proud
to say that in a month he&#39;ll be
graduating on time he&#39;s ridden his
grades have risen up to a three point
three he has done the work and more
importantly for he and his mother his
family is also heal and so we know that
advocacy and action is what this looks
like and it looks like everybody
supporting that work so now the half the
ABCs of advocacy are fairly simple so
I&#39;m gonna we&#39;re gonna go through them
with you but I want you to do another
little activity with me close your eyes
again but i just and i just wants you
with me to say the first three letters
of you ABCs are we ready
ABC stop now you wanted to go the rest
now here&#39;s the one thing I know I don&#39;t
think too many of us went to school
together we all said it the same way
right and so while your ABCs because we
never forget the first one a affirmation
using the Batman analogy one of the
greatest things that he&#39;s learned from
his father and later Alfred and his ugh
other advocates why do we fall so we can
learn to pick ourselves back up being
affirmative and they&#39;re firming our
young people and telling them the things
they know they can believe in a
consistently reminding them of greatness
within them is the first premise of the
ABCs affirmation belief they see the
quote says I tried to change once look
where it got me
alpha sells them you don&#39;t change for
someone else you change for yourself
believing in our young people beyond a
shadow of a doubt we know the premise of
belief is to hope for a thing that does
not get seen but we know is real that is
belief and each and every one of our
young people
lastly commitment
now I want to talk like Michael Caine
one day it takes an unwavering level of
commitment to the cause of the young
people it has been my pleasure to serve
so much when I commit to a young person
to be an advocate to be a mentor to me
it&#39;s like signing up for the rest of
their life I tell all the young people I
mentor I&#39;m with you until you tell me no
longer right and even then I&#39;m still
probably gonna be with you it&#39;s a level
of commitment that you have to see
through as many of our young people will
test that cuz they&#39;ve had relationships
in which adults have made promises and
fallen short of the mark so we want to
make sure when you make that commitment
that you honor that through and through
so we know our ABCs we know if we do our
vows we do AEIOU and sometimes why but
an advocacy there&#39;s always a while so
advocacy is purposeful so up here&#39;s is
my privilege to show you some of the
pictures of the many people that have
been the wise in my life I&#39;m gonna get
in trouble because there&#39;s not enough
room on the screen to show how many but
these are some of the most powerful
reasons I have done what I&#39;ve done I am
but a shallow reflection of the
greatness that is poured into my life
and I well I&#39;ve been an advocate I&#39;ve
learned so much more than I ever helped
hope to give so I want you to close your
eyes one more time and I want you to
picture the young person that you want
to affirm that you want to believe in
that you want to commit to and I want
you to picture them picture them fix
them put them right in front of you and
now open your eyes you just found your
wife and now you know your ABCs thank
you
[Applause]
all right give it up for Batman one more
time
