I want you to know before you step
outside that you are a warrior you are
warrior who is allowed to be soft a
warrior that is allowed to be scared a
warrior that is allowed to ask for help
but still a warrior I need you to know
that when I am writing this I have
changed my outfit 17 times I&#39;ve removed
my makeup for fear of insult I have
changed the way I walk down the street
but that I am still a warrior I need you
to know that when I am writing this I
have told myself it is okay to wish for
something easier I have told myself it
is okay to sometimes want to give up I
have told myself it is okay to feel
alone but that I am still a warrior I
want you to know before you step outside
that there are others stepping here too
the people have stepped before us with
us and after us that the pavements can
feel so lonely but I know I have stepped
there too that we have existed before
and exists in the present and exists in
the future that we come from a line of
warriors we did not ask to fight but we
know how to survive before you step
outside we love you
before you step outside I love you
before you step outside breathe I love
you thank you hi everyone my name is
Travis alabanza I&#39;m an artist I&#39;m a
performer I&#39;m a writer and amongst many
other things I am also trans and I say
this to kind of get out the way as a
kind of not disclaimer disclaimer as a
kind of thing that I feel needs to be
said often in public space so that we
can move forward I say this not because
it is the be-all and end-all of my talk
but I say this because I feel it is
central point to my talk
and I want us to be on the same page I
think so often trans people in public
space have to constantly declare their
transness in order to move forward so
here I am in this big scary really big
scary room declaring that I am trans but
I feel like often at the moment with
trans people all over the media calling
it the trans tipping point that we think
we all know what trans means but just
for the sake of this talk let me go
through a really brief 101 description
this isn&#39;t going to be your Judith
Butler this isn&#39;t going to be your
gender theory lesson this is meaning
this is mainly the means to an end
so we can move forward trans in short
with this description means that all of
us at Birth were made a decision without
our consent every day when someone is
born without their consent they are told
they are either boy or girl we then go
forth and I told we have to live that
life becoming boy to man to girl to
woman trans in short just means that you
were given that without your consent and
you&#39;ve decided that that does not fit in
short trans just means you were told a
gender without your consent at birth and
now in whatever shape or form you are
not that gender there&#39;s another word I&#39;m
going to be using today for out this
talk that I think we should just get on
the same page with and that is cysts or
cisgender in short basically meaning not
trans meaning that that decision without
your consent at Birth that you are a boy
or a girl kind of still fits with you
now and you&#39;re alright with it so me I&#39;m
trans insert big TED talk balloons come
down confetti cannon everyone 12-round
and applause but really all that it
means is that I was given something boy
or manhood a birth and that that is not
who I am but I decided to Claire my
autonomy over my body and say actually
that doesn&#39;t fit I actually exist
somewhere over here or somewhere over
there or somewhere in the middle but
it&#39;s actually none of our business for
this talk
trans people can exist in many different
shapes sizes looks or identities trans
people can look like me
could not look like me and trans people
over evolution of also mastered the
ability to become invisible that was a
joke
trans people also have a sense of humor
so moving on from our 101 definition
what am I actually here to talk about
I&#39;m actually here to talk about
something that goes beyond trans and sis
there goes beyond these identities and
into something that we all experience
into something that every one of us in
this room in order to get here has
experience so I read a poem from my book
today and I did that for two main
reasons my first reason is because I&#39;m a
writer and I thought that I&#39;m starting
out with one of my poems would make me a
lot less nervous sidenote it really
didn&#39;t but to because from that book
every single poem diary entry an essay
that I have written I had written on
public transport I had written outside I
had written in the public sphere whether
on a bus on a tube sometimes even on a
plane and that is the experience that I
want us to be talking about today the
experience of going outside two years
ago I became obsessed with this notion
of something that bonded us all or most
of us altogether the fact that most of
us all go outside we all go outside we
all go from A to B we all get on tubes
or buses or trains but what I was really
interested in is how we were
experiencing this differently and that&#39;s
what I want to talk with you about today
who is going outside how are we
experiencing going outside knowing that
so many of us are afraid of going
outside but in that fear whose fear is
actually being heard I want to take you
back to April 2016 I was on Waterloo
Bridge which is a really busy bridge in

London and it was about 2:00 p.m. broad
daylight and it was sunny for once and I

say 2:00 p.m. because that is the lunch
rush hour for people that are from
London in the room everyone knows the
Waterloo Bridge is ridiculously busy it
almost feels like a conveyor belt
whenever I walk on Waterloo Bridge I
always think that I&#39;m in a movie but not
one of those good movies I feel like a
robot but what I&#39;m trying to say is that
there was loads of people and at that

moment at 2:00 p.m. I remember someone
shouted the word tranny and threw a
chicken burger at my shoulder

I will repeat in broad daylight at 2:00
p.m. on Waterloo Bridge around 150
people witnessed
a person fro a burger Act me whilst
calling me a tranny as it hit my
shoulder now I noticed some gasps or
tuts or shocks but I&#39;m actually not here
to talk about the moment of violence in
their act of throwing the burger I&#39;m not
here to talk about the man that threw it
I&#39;m not here to talk about what the
burger smell or tasted like I&#39;m not here
to fetes eyes about who or what his
intentions were instead I&#39;m here to talk
about the violence in the surrounding
moment after that attack I&#39;m here to
talk about some kind of violence that I
feel it&#39;s not spoken about enough and
that is the violence in silence that is
the violence in the fact that 150 people
saw another person from a chicken burger
at another human being and no one did a
thing I do not want to cool it by
standing for I feel bystander suggests
something that is so much more passive
than what is happening instead I want to
talk about the active choice in the
Silence of protecting trans and gender
non-conforming people in public some
people pretended not to see and look
down many people looked at me looked at
the burger looked at him and carried on
walking one lady even looked at me in
the eye as if to say sorry but never
quite saying it and then walked at a
faster pace moving forward I actually
had to touch the mayonnaise on my dress
to make sure that it was real because if
you&#39;d looked around moments after it
would have looked like any other day and
this was a real changing point for me as
a trans person existing in public space
I&#39;m not saying this was the first type
of harassment I&#39;d received anything but
that but what I did notice in that
moment is something but I felt was so
absurd as a burger being thrown another
human being
was so normalized to everyone else what
I realized in that precise moment is
that trans and gender non-conforming
people are not protected in public space
we are attacked but then also not
protected when we are attacked that
there is a silence surrounding our
violence and that actually that is
of the violence what I realized in that
moment it is not just the attacker who
is at fault but actually by everyone
remaining silent on that bridge it tells
the attacker that he can go the next day
and do the exact same thing and no
punishment will be received now I could
have spoken about the violence today but
I&#39;m going to judge that we&#39;re all this
liberal room that feel like we&#39;re okay
with trans people because we shared an
image of Caitlyn Jenner on our Facebook
but actually a hundred and fifty people
on that Waterloo Bridge looked exactly
like you or did now I&#39;ll be a bit
smaller about so I have to wonder I can
no longer take it and say that yes
people will protect me because actually
evidence has shown otherwise and I want
to give you another example because I
really want to reinstate that this
violence this moment of the burger being
thrown is not some absurd thing out of
the blue that this kind of violence
happens to trans and gender
non-conforming people every time we step
outside two months ago I was doing a gig

in Nottingham and it ended around 11:30
and I was walking back home with some
friends I saw a McDonald&#39;s and I was
just really really hungry and shamefully
I want to pretend that that wasn&#39;t the
restaurant I went into but it was and I
went into the McDonald&#39;s and it was
really really busy and it was about

11:30 on a Saturday night so it was
packed and rowdy and there was lot for
different people but I felt okay because
I was with my two friends I walked in
and instantly I heard a laughter that
it&#39;s all so familiar I&#39;m so used to this
laughter laughter directed at my body a
laughter that is telling me that I am
not human but rather an object what was
different though is the laughter was not
coming from customers but in fact the
staff behind the counter the staff could
not hold in professionalism and instead
started to laugh point and gawk at me
they said to the chef I can&#39;t believe we
have to cook for this it I decided I
wasn&#39;t going to take it I decided that
I&#39;d already been harassed three times
that day I was not going to stand for
this so I retaliated I shouted back I
said something along the lines that I
thought was quite elegant but probably
shouldn&#39;t be said because my mum is now
watching and then a security guard came
up to me and I thought okay maybe I&#39;m
about to be at ease but instead actually
what happened was
hurry guard asked me to leave he said
take your food and leave quietly and
what happened in that moment is not only
did the busy room of restaurant people
not do anything but also two men shared
when I left what this tells me again is
not only that we are not protected in
our violence but we are actually victim
blamed for the violence we experienced I
repeat we are victim blamed for the
violence we experienced because of our
transgression of gender because we are
deviant from the rules of man or woman
we are seen as believing slash deserving
of the violence we then experience now
some of you may be saying hold on a
minute
trans people aren&#39;t the only people that
experience harassment of course there&#39;s
probably many cisgender women in the
room they&#39;re also worried about going
home at night that also hold their phone
they&#39;ll also talk about cabs at night
and I&#39;m not disputing that violence but
I do think there was a difference in how
that violence is perceived and what kind
of harassment is noted and I&#39;ll give a
really quick illustration to demonstrate
that on a tube three months ago Victoria
Line Brixton up to seven sisters it was
very very busy and I could see a woman
was sat down and a drunk man stood up
and called her a slut instantly the
whole room or the tube erupted within
one stop the man was ejected the woman
was being offered a bottle of water and
I even stood up and was like hey are you
ok do you want to take two seats and at
first I thought this was a really good
example of community coming together but
I couldn&#39;t help but admitting that I was
actually quite jealous afterwards
quite angry because two weeks prior on
that very same tube I was called a
faggot by a group of men and no one did
anything two weeks before that a mum
actually tattooed at me and asked why I
was making a scene and someone else
laughed and continued to read their
paper I could go on and on with
experiences but I&#39;m well aware I&#39;m
already over time instead what I want to
point out is that what is this is doing
is showing that some people are believed
in the violence they experienced and
others are not and what this does is
create a dangerous cycle that means that
violence won&#39;t stop adverts about
harassment almost never show people that
look like me and although that woman was
also protected by other privileges such
as whiteness no visible disability no
visible religion that would have meant
that she was discriminated against I
can&#39;t help but also believe that her
sisters that being that she wasn&#39;t trans
was a focal point of the fact that
she was being able to see as a victim
this is not an option for me this is an
epidemic of violence that faces trans
and gender non-conforming people every
day all of the trans people that I live
with constantly say every single day
that they are harassed and that no one
did anything so what do we do I don&#39;t
really want to give this like neat TED
wrap up where I say that I have all
these ideas about what we&#39;re gonna do
because I probably would have tried them
by now instead I guess I just wanted you
to meet a real-life actual trans person
off of your screens and realize what we
are experiencing is real and killing us
I wanted us to realize that when we step
outside we need to stop thinking about
an individual and start thinking as a
collective that in this current and
current political climate so many of us
are fearful about going outside and we
nod to start realizing that we are a
community rather than an an individual
we cannot look down and hope the next
person will do something because chances
are they won&#39;t ask how you&#39;re trans
friends are getting home pay for our
transportation until it is safe for us
to go public start acting like you were
not the only person in the room and
instead smile at us after you look at us
because you&#39;re probably the seventh
person that&#39;s looked at us on that
journey trust us and believe us when we
say we are in danger and need your help
I&#39;ve been trying to do this on my own
but I can no longer do it I think I also
started with this book because it&#39;s
called before I step outside you love me
and I think it&#39;s as simple as that I
wonder what it would feel like to be
loved and cared for outside trans and
gender non-conforming people I love you
[Applause]
you
