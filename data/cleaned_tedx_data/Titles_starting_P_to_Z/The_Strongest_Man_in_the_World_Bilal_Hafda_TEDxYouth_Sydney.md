see me I&#39;m not a strong man no I met the
strongest man in the world when I was
eight years old he lifted me on his arm
and when I asked him how he did it he
said it was easy that I hardly Wade a
singer or how could I make him sore when
he was so big and I stood near him and
looked so small see me I&#39;m not a strong
man no I met the strongest man in the
world when I was less than a minute old
and he didn&#39;t hold me then didn&#39;t parade
in the long line of men in my wife life
who would tell me when my wife showed me
attitude that it was because of my
failings as a husband those marching men
flailing and stunted frightened the
having softened hearts would mean having
a softened chest but the strongest man
in the world
he taught me best taught me ignore the
rest and bore the zest out of life with
your wife and take a carving knife to
the modern model manly man see me I&#39;m
not a strong man no I meant the
strongest man in the world when I was
less than a minute old and he didn&#39;t
hold me then but he held my mum when she
held me in just us three felt lucky as
could be when I asked him later how he
did it he said it was easy that we
hardly weighed a thing or my father is
not really a tall man but he could draw
you a floor plan to the house he built
his children he knows it like the back
of his hand he knows each room and where
he would build them
he&#39;d say here I put the sunroom for you
kids to play and if I could I&#39;d call the
Sun and Moon down every day so you could
also look how strong my dad is my
father is the kindest man in the world
he would say here I put the kitchen and
I build all the cupboards at waist
height because you were all raised right
by the raised high I think your mum
might have a hard time reaching but I
build her that kitchen so you could all
never forget to mention look how strong
my dad is my father is the gentlest man
in the world he&#39;d say he I put the
garden and I could sit and watch from
the yard when your mum&#39;s green thumb
makes me numb makes everyone else&#39;s
green thumb same dumb I&#39;d build her a
garden and I&#39;d sit there guarding every
little thing she grew because she went
and grew each and every one of you my
father is the strongest man in the world
and for me strength
is the hardest word in the world to
define because if you look it up there
you&#39;ll find the quality or state of
being physically strong
I met the strongest man in the world
today I asked him how his morning was
and he said that the cold makes his
bones ache but he never moans awake when
he goes to take my little sister to
school so when she gets there she can
say I met the strongest man in the world
today what she&#39;ll really say is I met
the kindest man in the world today I met
the gentlest man in the world today I
met the most respectful man in the world
today I got dropped off by my dad today
thank you
