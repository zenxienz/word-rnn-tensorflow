so when I was 18 months old I stopped
breathing for several minutes
my parents panicked put me in the back
of the car and rushed me to the hospital
in the middle of the night where I was
revived and stabilized then the doctor
thought it was a good time to take my
parents aside and give them the bad news
he told them that because my brain had
been without oxygen for so long it had
been permanently damaged he said that
the entire side left side of my body was
now paralyzed he told them that I
wouldn&#39;t be able to walk again I
wouldn&#39;t be able to use my left hand
again and all of these things were going
to be permanent now my parents you know
they didn&#39;t have much medical training
they didn&#39;t actually have much schooling
at all because they migrated from Italy
after World War Two over to Australia
and you know my mum my mum&#39;s from
Calabria and my dad&#39;s from Sicily so you
know go to trouble but they don&#39;t agree
on a lot but they do agreed on one thing
they didn&#39;t believe the doctor so they
took me home and they forced me to use
the left side of my body they said we&#39;re
gonna put the food on your left side
we&#39;re gonna put your toys on the left
side I&#39;m gonna tell your brothers to
play rough with you and you know they I
don&#39;t know if you know this about
Italians but they can be quite stubborn
and they got me going they got me moving
they and within a few short years I
wasn&#39;t just moving a little bit I was
moving a lot I was running around
climbing things falling off of things
ending up back in hospital making my
parents really regret that they had
given me the motivation to keep going
but the point was that I was I was fully
100 percent better
and these days I work in New York I am
what is called the director of rehab
innovation for the Mount Sinai Health
System which is this big Health Network
in New York and my job is to take new
technologies robotics virtual reality
mobile apps anything that you can think
of there is just coming out on the
market my job is to take
that and apply it to the rehabilitation
of people suffering from a brain or
spinal cord injury I really love my job
it&#39;s very rewarding and it&#39;s it&#39;s
founded on a couple of central questions
about how the brain recovers from damage
so we&#39;re gonna do a quick crash course
on this right now
so our brains are made out of brain
cells we call these neurons and neurons
team up together to produce different
functions so my work and the work of
many other scientists have shown that
you need a big team of neurons together
to produce movement now unfortunately
when you have brain damage that team is
broken and that is the most catastrophic
thing that causes the loss of movement
control and all of these symptoms that
we see after damage to the brain now
it&#39;s not all bad news the brain has the
ability to recover and that ability is
called neuroplasticity what that means
is that some neurons that survive the
initial damage they can form new teams
they can reach out to other neurons in
the brain nearby that do similar things
and pull them into a new team and
sometimes if the brain gets it just
right that new team can be just as
effective as the old team sometimes even
more effective so it&#39;s really exciting
that we have this ability to heal
ourselves but a central question in the
in the world of rehabilitation right now
is how do we get all neurons to
cooperate the way that we just saw our
last hero neuron do you know not all
neurons do that sometimes neurons will
reach out to their neighbors other times
they won&#39;t and we don&#39;t know why and
it&#39;s a really important question that we
have to solve the reason for that is
that rehab is about to become a global
concern that the world is aging at an
unprecedented rate it&#39;s actually thought
that by 2050 there will be 3 times more
people over the age of 65 than ever
before
and I don&#39;t hate all people anything
like that you know don&#39;t don&#39;t worry you
can trust me around you not known you&#39;re
not north but the problem is that brain
jury increases over time as you age your
risk of brain injury and so if we don&#39;t
get some really great therapies out
there that can be very very effective
we&#39;re going to be very overburdened in
the time to come so it&#39;s an important
question that we need to answer and so
when when I have these sort of difficult
questions there&#39;s a exercise I like to
use which is it&#39;s an innovation exercise
we call it the superhero versus the
super villain the super villain is the
problem that you&#39;re trying to solve in
this case I&#39;m trying to solve the
problem of we have all of these people
who have had a brain injury or a spinal
cord injury and some of them respond to
therapy and others don&#39;t and we don&#39;t
know why some of them will go through
hours and hours and thousands of
repetitions and they don&#39;t get any
better so that&#39;s my super villain I need
to understand what is going on with
these people and how can we how can we
inspire them to get better and so then
for my superhero I look around the world
and I try and find someone who&#39;s solved
that problem already and so I looked and
I found someone and I found a superhero
uh-huh this is Rebecca rush
Rebecca is the toughest human being who
ever matched very resilient her
competitors call her the queen of paint
that&#39;s how tough she is and she is an
ultra endurance cyclist she is an elite
performance athlete and as I got to know
Rebecca I started to realize that there
are a lot of similarities between
someone recovering from a stroke and
someone who&#39;s training for the Olympics
or a World Championship or anything that
elite athletes are doing you have these
people who need to perform thousands and
thousands of boring repetitions of a
movement just to get a little bit better
but they keep doing it so I wanted to
understand how athletes get such a good
record of success while our our stroke
survivors and our kids with cerebral
palsy are and so thanks to the Red Bull
human performance division we got to
study Rebecca and a whole bunch of other
great athletes so my colleagues there
Dylan Edwards and Mark Cortese we got to
put wires all over Rebecca and her
fellow athletes we got to follow him
around asking them annoying questions
every day we got to try to see what
exactly makes them tick
and we started to see but yeah the
physical stuff is one thing they were
working really hard harder than most
people that you could imagine but then
there was a whole mental component that
we leave out of rehab where their
coaches everybody is making sure they&#39;re
in the right mindset to be doing their
exercise every day so I decided to ask
the question what happens if we start to
treat our patients like performance
athletes and at first I got told well
this is a silly idea it&#39;s too expensive
it&#39;s impractical patients aren&#39;t
athletes you shouldn&#39;t do this but I
think I inherited some of the
stubbornness from my parents so I went
along and did it anyway and the first
thing I did was I made a video game this
is a video game that was designed to
rehabilitate people from stroke they
play a game it it learns how impaired
they are and it adjusts to just their
level of impairment and then they play
and it makes their rehab fun so we
pulled together a bunch of people who
are recovering from a stroke and we gave
them a get the game to play and we
tightly controlled the dosage of therapy
everyone got the same amount of therapy
and what we saw after six weeks was that
most people improved but the more fun
you were having while you were doing the
game playing the game the more you
improved what we proved here which was
very very important and exciting was
that the same dosage of therapy if it&#39;s
delivered in a fun environment it goes
further than if it&#39;s delivered in an
environment that is not fun so that was
exciting and we thought okay maybe
there&#39;s something here and then I
collaborated with another great
scientist who&#39;s actually lives not too
far from here in Brescia his name&#39;s max
gobo and a fantastic scientist and we we
set up a situation where stroke
survivors were given two different rehab
environments one environment was lots of
fun and the other environment yeah not
so much fun it was pretty repetitive
pretty boring but they were both aimed
at doing the same thing what we saw was
that every single time in every metric
that we were studying in these patients
the more fun environment brought out a
harder work ethic they worked harder
they consumed more oxygen their muscles
pushed harder everything was harder so
now we&#39;re seeing that a fun environment
makes you rehab more effective and it
also makes you work harder so we did one
more experiment we studied a group of
patients a very group special group of
stroke patients who have a condition
called post stroke apathy these people
can&#39;t feel emotions as strongly as you
are a so they&#39;re very difficult to
engage and and they&#39;re very difficult to
actually get them involved in something
that will bring them fun and bring them
joy we studied them alongside people who
didn&#39;t have apathy and what we saw was
that the people with apathy had much
worse outcomes than the people without
apathy so we&#39;re really starting to see
this idea through all of these studies
that fun and engagement is this really
important ingredient to successful
rehabilitation that people have been
discarding they&#39;ve just been saying look
to make sure they get the rehabilitation
don&#39;t worry if it&#39;s fun now we&#39;re seeing
it might be the ingredient that makes it
all work and I know that this sounds a
little bit like I&#39;m a hippie and I know
you know you&#39;ve got a lot of people from
the west coast here and you expect the
cynical New Yorker to to not be that way
so let me prove to you I&#39;m not there&#39;s a
really great researcher in in Canada
called Dale Corbett and he showed this
in rats so if you put a rodent who&#39;s
recovering from a stroke on a wheel and
it&#39;s working away it recovers but if you
team it up with a community and it&#39;s
getting a lot of social interaction
while it&#39;s running on the wheel it
recovers even more so our brains go into
this state when you&#39;re being engaged
when you&#39;re being challenged that makes
our exercise more effortful and
effective and I&#39;m really fortunate that
I get to work with people who are on the
cutting edge of all of this stuff and
one of my colleagues Kathleen frail she
she has been inspiring me for years and
she has one of the most effective
rehabilitation programs in the country
for cerebral palsy and she gets all of
these young kids and she treat treats
them like superheroes
it is absolutely literally superhero
training where these kids are playing
their games and they&#39;re having a lot of
fun they completely forget that they&#39;re
actually doing rehab and they can&#39;t wait
to come to the next day of camp and the
next day a camp and they get upset when
the camp is over and this is the sort of
thing that brings about the best
outcomes and it&#39;s really meaningful you
know when you reframe the idea of
rehabilitation into play something
magical happens people forget their
limits or more importantly they escape
the limits that us as a society have put
upon them so that they can now start to
do things they start to realize that
internally they have their own strengths
that you know maybe they don&#39;t do things
like everybody else but they do
something better they do it like
themselves it&#39;s a little bit different
but it works they&#39;re not defined by
their disease or their diagnosis and
this is the message if we can get this
message out not just to people
recovering but to their caregivers and
to the people in the larger community
this is what is going to take
rehabilitation into the 21st century so
I really want to finish up by
introducing you guys to someone very
special this is Tom Tom has severe
cerebral palsy he&#39;s nonverbal which
means he uses a computer to speak his
words for him he doesn&#39;t walk so well so
he uses a chair to get from place to
place and if you were to sit with Tom he
would be moving uncontrollably the whole
time because his brain has a lot of
difficulty filtering out unwanted
movements so if you were to see Tom in
the street you probably wouldn&#39;t know a
lot of things about him you probably
wouldn&#39;t know that he has an amazing
sense of humor and he swears like a
pirate you also wouldn&#39;t know that he
has seen more broadly Broadway musicals
than everyone in this room probably
combined and you also won&#39;t know that he
dreams of being an actor one day and
that he was signed recently to appear on
a major US TV show as an actor and not
48 hours ago I was sitting in New York
in a theater that looks like this and I
had the absolute pleasure of watching
Tom give a one-man
we&#39;re in a crowded theater he performed
he wrote he produced and then he
performed one hour of content to a rapt
audience who got up and gave him a
standing ovation for his award-winning
show so if that&#39;s not a superhero I
don&#39;t know what is and my question is
why on earth would we treat him like
anything but that thank you
[Applause]
