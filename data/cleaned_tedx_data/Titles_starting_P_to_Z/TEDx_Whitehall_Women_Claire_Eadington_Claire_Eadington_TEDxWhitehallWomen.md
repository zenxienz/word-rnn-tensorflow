hi so I&#39;ve just stepped onto the Ted
stage with some random objects but
hopefully that will become clear later
on I grew up in Cumbria it&#39;s a beautiful
place we haven&#39;t gone at the Lake
District and we want to call it
beautiful
it&#39;s called Cumbria and when I was
little we used to go on long cold rainy
walks because when you&#39;re seven walks
are always long and cold and rainy and
every time we got to a bridge
my dad would sing a song I&#39;m a troll
Roley oh and I&#39;ll eat you for bicep ooh
and you&#39;ve got to imagine my dad&#39;s voice
is this big low boomy voice and so I
knew aged seven there was a troll under
every bridge and these are the bridges
that I want to talk to you about today
high bridges where you&#39;re scared to look
down the bridge is covered in mist with
half the planks missing that when you
step on them they swing from side to
side so to cross the bridge you&#39;ve got
to know what&#39;s on the other side you&#39;ve
got to want to be there and you&#39;ve got
to need what it is that&#39;s there on the
other side otherwise don&#39;t bother put a
kettle on cup of tea like it&#39;s on
vinegar crisps but a Netflix but if that
sounds like the perfect metaphor for
whatever it is that you feel you can&#39;t
achieve right now I am here to tell you
you can cross that bridge and you can
avoid being eaten by trolls at the same
time so this is a tuning fork
I&#39;m Sonny was head stage of the tuning
fork as a professional singer and as a
member of the Chamber Choir when I was
at Oxford University I got to travel the
world to sing and we were going through
customs in China and the security guard
was searching our bags and he pulled out
one of these and looked like he&#39;d found
an offensive weapon there&#39;s a really
easy way to defuse this situation right
to demonstrate the troll that was there
that day was the feeling that we weren&#39;t
going to be understood there was a huge
chasm between our culture&#39;s and our
language so it&#39;s not just customs you go
around the world with your music and the
troll follows you wherever I&#39;ve been
Israel Russia Mexico the troll was there
saying are you going to be accepted and
you&#39;re gonna be understood but when you
sing with other people something
brilliant happens your voices form this
structure just your voices and then in
cultures where you can barely order a
cup of coffee you can explain things to
people
hope depression love or grief your
skills are more powerful than you think
the things that you know how to do and
the things that you&#39;ve learned how to do
you can elbow the culture gap troll out
of the way you&#39;ll cross that bridge this
is a bit by row this is my best friend I
like this little more than I like a lot
of people that&#39;s my colleague and in my
current job for the Environment Agency
and I use this a lot the other things
that I need to do my job an open mind
and it helps to have a sense of humor in
my job I listen to people&#39;s problems
help them find solutions and I match
those solutions with the people who are
best place to make it happen
a bit like a wireless router or this
jumbled information comes in
and then helpful friendly solutions come
out the other side but to do the most
effective job you just need to do less
with what you&#39;ve got if you need to
write something down you don&#39;t spend two
weeks planning a trip to Paper Chase you
grab what&#39;s to hand and you get to your
outcome use your skills and your
resources to just do the things that
need to be done and the same goes for
those who&#39;s managing teams people are
our most valuable resource they have
experience they have skills they have
enthusiasm and who is the right person
to do the job he&#39;ll just do the work and
get to that outcome
who is your BIC pyro trust that you have
the resources you need the people you
need the people you the pens in the
post-it notes but you need the people
when the troll inside or outside of you
tells you that you haven&#39;t got the
resources you need just be resourceful
get the trial out of the way you might
be wondering what this big white oily
thing is and this is a clippie bike shoe
and experts will tell you this makes you
cycle faster I&#39;d like to tell you that
this straps you to your bike so that
when you&#39;re going down quite a steep
hill you can&#39;t get out of it but this
shoe also quite cheese that he
represents how I overcame the biggest
troll which was my lack of self belief
and in July I found myself on the start
line of a Half Ironman Triathlon you
might let&#39;s call it a half iron person
triathlon given where we are today at
school I wasn&#39;t the sporty type I was
one of the musical ones I was the one
who came forth us in cross country and
got told off by my cross-country teacher
for being sick on a path and not in a
bush
I&#39;m sure a lot was can relate to that um
but you know luckily with adulthood
comes a little bit of perspective the
troll that was there at school that just
jumped up gameofthrones giant-sized
really hairy and said here&#39;s a free pass
be a musician
don&#39;t be fit and healthy it was kind of
there all the way through to when I left
University
so with adulthood I got a little bit a
little bit wiser and very slowly and
painfully I started talking it&#39;s really
slow and painful I&#39;m sure lots of us
here have done that and yeah it does it
does feel out of everybody and but I did
that and gradually I edged the troll out
around a 5k race run a 10k race half
marathon I even did a beginners
triathlon for charity but for my time as
a singer I knew that evidence enough it
wouldn&#39;t get me past that bit where I
felt like I was about to fail it needed
something else
it needed gumption so I entered this
half iron distance triathlon immediately
the troll jumped out from behind its
bridge kind of bush stage right and said
you shouldn&#39;t do that you can&#39;t do that
you&#39;ve got no right to be triathlon yeah
so my big pyro had a new list of things
to write down a list of things that
someone knew some are hard I went back
to the swimming pool and I really so on
buddies I&#39;d got when I was 10 I also
spawn outside for the first time in wet
suits in Salford keys 14 degrees cold
water Oakland I also learned to ride a
bike with curry handlebars with some of
these shoes and and I bought that bike
secondhand through a boss and he my fun
boss who was
understanding and gave me a little
lesson in our work parking garage to try
out and he got to watch me twice Topol
Bridget Jones style like a swan onto the
hard concrete floor good I also learned
that when you have your little pieces of
Malta loaf in the bag on your bike
if you don&#39;t zip it up properly they
fall out and Motlow falling off the bike
it&#39;s blinking onto the road sounds like
bits of your bike falling off I spent a
whole giraffe long race in the warm-up
for my triathlon petrified then my gears
are about to shieff off my bike can I
squeeze me left grazed and stranded and
I just ended up with a bit that&#39;s not
life that&#39;s really sad I also joined a
CrossFit gym I wanted to get stronger I
didn&#39;t just get stronger and like there
I found a community of people who were
told you can do it with the body you&#39;ve
got and that culture is like bug spray
for trolls so although there were dark
moments and there were dark moments
there were times when I look back over
my shoulder and I saw how far I had come
already so July came and in one weekend
I went to my friend&#39;s wedding in
Liverpool and I did the triathlon in
Norfolk not a bridge that it seemed
possible to cross the time but we ate
the elephant one slice at a time as the
saying goes and on the day itself I had
a flat tire before the race started and
I had my first ever open water swimming
induced panic attack but I did it and
although I was challenged again and
again I wet up went at it I tried and I
failed I went at it with gumption the
trolls were always there inside and out
but the more little things I did the
smaller they got the quieter they got I
just had to try so which trolls have
told you that you have not got the
skills the resources or the gumption to
cross whichever Bridget brood
it is you want to cross you have the
skills you have the resources and you
have the gumption you will cross the
bridge thank you
[Applause]
