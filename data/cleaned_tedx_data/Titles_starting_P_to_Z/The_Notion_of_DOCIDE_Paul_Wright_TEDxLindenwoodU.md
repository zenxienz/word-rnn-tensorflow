Rhys what does it mean to rise it comes
from the german word raison to mean to
travel in 12th century england to rise
meant to move from a lower position to a
higher position and as I go through my
talk today I want you to think about
Rhys is referring to being more
tomorrow&#39;s than perhaps you are today as
we&#39;ve been preparing to the start of
this wonderful event we&#39;ve observed many
Lindenwood students cross this stage
many of them have worked for years to
cultivate their unique talents now not
all of us can bounce a ball on our head
or walk across the stage on our hands or
cough circles in stage and rollerskates
in fact I probably would cause myself
serious bodily harm to try any of that
but we all have a capacity to rise to
cultivate our own unique talent my
challenge to each and every one of you
today is to think about what is your
unique talent what can you do to rise to
your true potential
sometimes our life just seems to happen
to us we are constantly bombarded by
expectations and stresses and financial
hardships our life was not always that
way
when we were young we had teachers that
asked us what will you be when you grow
up and our answers explorers astronauts
pirates superheroes supervillains
maybe doctors nurses and some of us may
be movie stars my question to all of you
is this by show of hands how many of you
are still living the life of your dreams
that&#39;s good
buy another show of hands how many of us
would like to still have a piece of that
childhood dream ladies and gentlemen it
is possible you see we are to a day we
die
Architects of our own destiny we are
Admirals of our own starships and we
have potential I remember when I was
very young I had a coach who used to
tell us that we should reach for the
stars
you see if we reach for the stars and
the worst that could happen is we could
end up in the trees and the view from
there is much better from the ground
when I was a little boy growing up in
England
I lived in a very small town we had one
television set with just three channels
but I do remember in 1984 tuning in to
watch the opening ceremonies for the Los
Angeles Olympic Games in 1984 dating
myself a little I was so excited to
watch these giants of athletics perform
because they were my heroes in fact this
is my first novel ladies and gentlemen
written in 1984 recording the wonderful
athletic performances of both Olympians
I still remember today Mary Lou Retton
winning the all-around gold medal in
women&#39;s gymnastics and the great rowdy
Gaines three gold medals in swimming
Carl Lewis four gold medals in track and
field to replicate Jesse Owens from 1936
in the hundred to two hundred to four by
one in the long jump I remember so well
the four by one relay where America
broke the world record and on that relay
team there were two outstanding athletes
Carl Lewis and the great Calvin Smith
Calvin Smith former world record holder
and 100-meter dash seven years later I
was at the University of Alabama on a
track and there was an unusual
excitement because I was leaned up in
the lane 5 and the excitement was not
for me but in Lane 6 Calvin Smith was
there while he proceeded to destroy me
but I remember the excitement that I
felt that day racing a great Olympian
well going back to 1984 after watching
those closing ceremonies I devoted my
life to become an Olympian every choice
I made as a child was related to the
Olympic Games had a great career in
England as a junior athlete and then I
came to Clemson University in South
Carolina to represent a university and
compete in the NCAA Division one
athletics after that I continued my
athletic career and when all across the
world competing as an elite athlete
chasing my Olympic dream
unfortunately injury upon injury led me
to struggling to make Allan
fifteen in 2000 I broke my leg in Kenya
and had to admit that my Olympic dream
was over at least as an athlete however
years of practice training dedicated
commitment and competition have prepared
me very well to be a coach so I decided
to change tacks and I challenged myself
to try and help another make the same
dream that I had aspired for I became an
international coach and I traveled
coaching across the country and across
the world and I trained athletes so that
they could go and achieve their own
dreams in 2000 I was invited to carry
the Olympic torch for the Winter Games
in Salt Lake City Utah
and it was an amazing experience and I
still remember the Olympic dream burning
deeply here inside me and I carried on
coaching in 2010 I received another call
to go to China I was invited to go be
the Hong Kong national team coach so I
moved my family across the globe and
found myself in a very strange country
preparing Hong Kong athletes for the
Olympic Games in 2012 I arrived in
London and stepped out onto the Olympic
track in my hometown my life had gone
full circle I had now after 28 years
after watching the opening ceremonies of
a 1984 Olympics I finally was now
experiencing my dream of my very own
sometimes we give up just a little too
quickly now I&#39;m not saying wait 28 years
I&#39;m sure you all have dreams one of the
things that inspires me is watching what
our true potential really is I have a
riddle I tell my students once upon a
time there were five little frogs let&#39;s
see how you do those five little frogs
was sitting in a lake on a log and it
was really hot and it was sweating so
all five frogs at the same time decide
to jump into the water the question is
how many frogs are now sound that log
the answer might surprise you you see
there are still five frogs sat on that
log because the conundrum is but
deciding is not the same as deciding do
siding means we make a commitment to
action how many of us are like those
frogs still satting on the log waiting
for the right time the right moment the
right motivation or perhaps even the
right push many of you in here have
incredible talent but perhaps you don&#39;t
appreciate the talents you do have some
of you are outstanding cooks some of you
are probably great teachers great
athletes great musicians some of you are
perhaps good scrapbookers I know that
many of you are great husbands wives
sons and daughters boyfriends
girlfriends we all have talent
Matthew Sayyid a former Olympic table
tennis player from Great Britain wrote a
wonderful book entitled bounce the myth
of talent and the power of practice in
his book he claims that everybody has
the unique capacity to be an expert at
anything they choose if they choose to
engage enough time and focused practice
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is considered to
be one of the greatest composers of all
time
many believed that he was a childhood
prodigy well that&#39;s not the whole story
you see Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had a
very famous father Leopold was a violin
teacher one of the best in Europe he was
also an obsessive father who made his
son practice sometimes up to eight hours
a day starting from the age of three now
if that&#39;s not child abuse I&#39;m not sure
what is but by the age of six Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart had accumulated almost
4,000 hours of practice is it any wonder
by the age of 21 he was one of the
foremost musicians in the world why
because he had given more time to
practice and perhaps anybody else
I believe that again
anybody can achieve great success if
they commit themselves to practice
you&#39;ve probably noticed this wonderful
young woman in the back this is my 14
year old daughter Misha Misha is a
composer too
she writes music three years ago she sat
down at the keyboard and composed her
first song a year later she cut a very
first CD today she&#39;s giving her very
first concert and everything she is
playing is a unique composition that she
wrote you see Misha is deciding as I&#39;ve
worked with Olympic level athletes and
Mischa&#39;s I have found that there are
five characteristics that shine in elite
performance and we can use the acronym
drive to understand that the D stands
for dedication the R stands for
repetition
repeating a skill until we attain a
certain level of proficiency I is for
investment a significant investment of
time and effort into our talent the vs
with vision having the vision to see our
potential in the future
is for excellence this idea of reaching
our true potential all successful people
have the drive to be very best that they
can be i want to indulge me for a second
i would like to leave you with a little
exercise please everybody put your right
hand high in the air notice how high
about hand is and on the count of three
I want to reach just a little higher one
two three and on the count of three once
more reach even higher one two three
what an interesting X plus four your
hands down I know you&#39;re tired what an
interesting exercise I asked you to
reach as high as you could and everybody
reached high then I asked you to go a
little higher and I saw the hands go a
little higher then a third time go
higher and still we found that extra a
little bit more my deepest desire for
everybody here today is to find
something that&#39;s meaningful in your life
that you would rise for something that
brings you joy and happiness and
excitement
ladies and gentlemen life is beautiful
life is magical rise and be the very
best that you all
be ladies and gentlemen I want to thank
you for allowing me to come share a
little bit about talent and in the words
of Ezra from chapter 10 verse 4 of the
Old Testament
it states arise be courageous
and do it thank you
[Applause]
