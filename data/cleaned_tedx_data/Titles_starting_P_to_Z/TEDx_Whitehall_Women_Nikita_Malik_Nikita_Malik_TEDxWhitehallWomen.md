so what were you doing when you were 15
years old at 15 Justin Bieber had just
released his first song which became
certified platinum in the United States
the current Dalai Lama at 15 years of
age found himself to be the undisputed
leader of six million people when I was
15 years old I was just daydreaming
about the day my braces would finally
come off and that cute boy in physics
would finally ask me out children were
doing different things at 15 years of
age I&#39;m sure that time brings back
memories for you too of being vulnerable
powerful or afraid this is mohamed ahmed
ismail he&#39;s 15 years old he lives in a
remand center a glorified prison in Iraq
last August Mohammad was found with a
suicide belt wrapped around his waist he
had been instructed by the terrorist
organization Islamic state to blow
himself up outside a football stadium
his father and his uncle were both
members of the same group his other 15
year old cousin blew himself up in a
nearly identical mission not very far
away
despite being trained for months both
militarily and in religious terms and
despite being told by the Islamic state
that if he would go through with this
mission Muhammad would die and become a
martyr when the time came to push the
button something in Mohammed resisted
and he found he couldn&#39;t do it that&#39;s
when security authorities detained him
in the remand Center where Mohammed
lives
he often gathers together other child
inmates and leads them in prayer
lecturing them on the radical Islam he
learned in his childhood spent in the
Islamic state there is currently no
rehabilitation program at the center to
address Muhammad&#39;s radicalization there
is no relief from the constant mental
torture that he faces every single day
sadly Muhammad is not the only child in
this situation in 2015 alone the Islamic
state abducted between 800 to 900
children from the ages of 9 to 15 in
Mosul in Iraq this Yazidi boy abducted
from Sinjar in Iraq and often seen
playing with guns and training
militarily in Islamic state propaganda
videos is one of them all too often
these children are used as human shields
as spies as guards as messengers and as
martyrs so here are some questions for
you how much choice do Mohammed and
other children have why should we care
and if we do care what can we do about
it
my name is Nikita Malik I&#39;ve spent my
career researching the use of children
by terrorist organizations particularly
by Islamic state I&#39;ve advised
governments around the world about
potential policy solutions to these
issues I would like to provide some
insight to you today so let&#39;s start with
question one how much choice did
Mohammed have when he found himself with
a suicide belt around his waist when he
was told to become a martyr for MA for
Muhammad and other child soldiers like
him the journey begins in the classroom
however this classroom is not your
ordinary classroom
the Islamic state has a systematic
process to win the hearts and minds of
the next generation of jihadists they
see each child as a blank slate where
any idea however violent or extreme can
be passed history textbooks for example
only teach Islamic history and nothing
else
physical education classes are renamed
jihadist training and focus on the
assembly use and storage of light
weapons if a child refuses to conform
they don&#39;t get your regular timeout or
detention rather these children are
flogged tortured and raped the prolonged
exposure and normalization of violence
that these children experience mean that
concepts are just killing yourself to
become a martyr become completely
normalized it also means that they
suffer from severe mental physical and
cognitive difficulties later on because
as I&#39;m sure we all know children are
less likely to question authority so the
second question why should we care
unfortunately the status quo is such
that Muhammad and other children like
him are likely to spend their entire
lives in detention often in solitary
confinement the current generation of
fighters in Islamic state see children
as better and more lethal fighters than
themselves this is because rather than
converting to a radical ideology these
children are born and indoctrinated into
extreme values as the Islamic state
loses territory in Iraq and Syria it is
likely that even more children will be
detained for the children who went from
the UK Europe and beyond many of them
are likely to return those who are
unable to return will use smuggling
networks to do so unless we effectively
find and demobilize these children they
also present a security threat
so how then do we build bridges to reach
these children how do we tap into
children like Muhammad&#39;s resilience to
indoctrination what can we do about it
the essence of any solution is to create
a sense of normality for these children
at the first instance this will involve
a deep and thorough risk assessment
because each child and each case will be
unique traditional approaches have
focused on three steps DDR
demobilization disarmament and
reintegration
however case studies we have researched
historically which look at children who
have exited the Taliban in Afghanistan
and Pakistan for example find that
children continue to face trauma even
when they have reengaged with civilian
life this can manifest itself in
regressing reenacting violence or
becoming increasingly antisocial and
disengaged therefore we need to add to
these DDR approaches we need to add
elements of D radicalization and
re-education in order to counter the
years of rain washing about martyrdom
that these children would have
experienced and the impact of violence
that would have affected them religious
scholars former extremists practitioners
and researchers all have a remarkable
role to play in informing any of these
approaches this is all new the space is
relatively innovative we can also rely
on things like sports therapy the use of
play the use of storytelling and rituals
in order to give back these children
some semblance of their childhood what
questions would we need to ask for
example if a child was to come back to
the UK from the Caliphate tomorrow
we&#39;d need to assess at the very least
the age of the child whether the child
voluntarily joined the group or was
coerced into doing so whether they
voluntarily exited it what about the
child&#39;s family can they be reintegrated
with them
or are they too radicalized these are
all essential questions to ask
however while conventions in theory
continue to be formed in this space the
sad reality is that muhammad&#39; and other
children like him face very little
access to such approaches at all unless
things change the center where muhammad
and other children find themselves mean
that they are likely to be subject to
torture physical and mental humiliation
on a daily basis what then do we do the
bridges to reach them do we build them
or do we burn them do we heal these
children or do we abandon them in its
famous book 1984 George Orwell wrote of
pain you can wish only one thing that it
should stop as a society our collective
mission should be to continue to stop
the use of children both by non-state
armed groups but especially by terrorist
organizations a childhood should be
carefree not a nightmare from which you
can never wake up let&#39;s make sure these
children aren&#39;t made prisoners of their
childhood thank you
you
