I would like to start by a quick raise
of hands to see who has got any kids in
here that&#39;s quite a lot so I&#39;ve got two
and like besaid I tell them bedtime
stories about science they&#39;re not really
educational stories it&#39;s more the
stories behind scientific research
stories about the people who didn&#39;t
answer because whenever asked why
somewhere around 1850 1860 a large cable
called the transatlantic Telegraph cable
was rolled out on the ocean floor
spending all the way from Europe to the
United States this was the only possible
solution at that time to send Morse code
messages from one continent to the other
but there was a problem in 1850 rubber
was not yet as widely known and used as
this today so the cable was designed
with materials that weren&#39;t really fit
for the environment in which they were
being used so that&#39;s why the cables
started breaking down not long after
they were installed so in order to
maintain and sometimes repair these
cables giant ships had to travel from
one continent to the other and back
again and hoist the cable from the ocean
floor and pull it on deck for closer
inspection now up until that time it was
believed that 500 meters was probably
the greatest depth that any creature
could live so it isn&#39;t hard to imagine
that people were shocked that when they
pulled these cables up for closer
inspection from depths somewhere around
1.8 kilometers below the sea surface
they found them covered in marine life
weird sea creatures would get tangled up
in these cables creatures we&#39;d never
seen before and that made us wonder what
else lives down there that we don&#39;t know
of and together with that wonderment
they were also renewed funds funds for
adventures that were willing to explore
that deep sea now it&#39;s
we try to fish for these creatures using
big Nets but the difference in pressure
between the deep sea and our own
environment cause a lot of the species
that were caught to simply explode when
they were surfaced so this meant that
the only way to really explore the deep
sea would be to go down there
in 1920 the ornithologist William beep
teamed up with an engineer called Otis
Barton and together they designed the
bathysphere it was basically just a
giant metal ball no doors no engines
just two oxygen tanks and a small bench
that was just big enough for the two of
them this is what it looked like by the
way so the two men had to crawl through
that little window then the window was
bolted airtight and the bathysphere was
winched from the deck with a steel cable
and lowered into the deep sea all the
way down with the bathysphere Otis and
William went six times deeper than
anyone ever did before them the deepest
they ever went was a little over 900
meters now of course at those depths
there&#39;s no longer sunlight penetrating
through the water surface so that&#39;s why
they brought torchlight to stare into
the darkness and that&#39;s how they set
their the two men on their little bench
with their torch light and a wiper to
clean the window every now and then just
staring in the black and looking for new
creatures to discover they didn&#39;t have a
camera in their little submarine it
wouldn&#39;t have worked there anyway
instead they had a telephone cable going
all the way up back to the ship and they
rambled on and on and on and on and on
about everything they saw down there and
on deck there was else postal mom she
was an artist who drew out everything
the two men described and when Otis and
William came back up
after successful dive they went straight
to the drawing board to see if the
images else made matched with what they
had seen below and if these images were
correct they were sent to local
newspapers or magazines like national
Geographics for publication now at first
people look at these pictures in
disbelief thinking that William and Otis
were lying or at least delirious because
of the debts that they were in but the
more our technology gave us the
opportunity to further explore this deep
sea the more their findings were
confirmed and after a while we were able
to create better more autonomous
submarines that could go to even greater
depths and the bathysphere found its
final resting place in the New York
Aquarium where you can still visit it
today as a designer I have great respect
for the value of creativity both in your
professional career as well as a tool
for personal development and creativity
is often regarded as some sort of talent
right as a gift as something that some
people are blessed with while others are
not but that&#39;s not how creativity works
creativity is a choice it&#39;s a choice of
curiosity over fear as Elizabeth Gilbert
defines it beautifully and for for
creativity you need two things you need
wonderment and you need the tools to do
something with that wonderment now
wonderment is about looking at the world
and constantly discovering new things in
it right questioning how stuff works who
made this what could I do with it
between parents there&#39;s this tacit
understanding that it&#39;s the children who
are raising their parents not your way
around and the reason for that is
wonderment children don&#39;t have to
actively force themselves to question
things it&#39;s natural to them it&#39;s all new
and we often mistake our kids wonderment
for creativity but creativity is a
choice to act wonderment is the attitude
and a mindset with which you take in the
world around you and wonder man this
contagious wonderment can be nourished
it can be taught but to do this you need
identity it&#39;s very hard to make someone
curious about something if you consider
it to be something that is dull or
boring wonderment needs authenticity you
have to be curious yourself the
curiosity has to come from you so that&#39;s
why I don&#39;t read stories to my kids I
tell them stories I want them to hear
these stories in my own words with my
own accentuations in my own voice so I
go up I guard and I look up stories and
then I go look for four pictures or ways
to get them involved and then I tell the
story for example I told that story of
the baddest fear to my foreigner have
four and a half year old about six
months ago and when I was making this
presentation and looking for a good
picture he came running to my screen a
sec look dad it&#39;s a batis fear and then
he recalled the entire story in his own
words and that&#39;s what wonderment will do
it&#39;s contagious and then the question is
how can we use that viral effect of
curiosity and wonderment when we are
raising and educating our children
schools are great at teaching new
content at teaching you the tools to be
creative with but that creativity won&#39;t
spark without wonderment right you learn
about the theorem of Pythagoras
the square of the hypotenuse is equal to
the sum of the squares of the other two
sides but you will rarely learn that
Pythagoras was actually trying to figure
out the height of the pyramids of Cheops
they&#39;ll teach you about material density
and how to calculate it using Archimedes
law but they won&#39;t tell you that our
comedians was trying to figure out if
the
of the king was made purely out of gold
you&#39;ll learn about some of the creatures
that are living in the deep sea but they
will rarely tell you the story of the
two madmen that crawled into a giant
metal ball and will winch down 900
meters below the sea surface to go
looking for these creatures if we want
our kids to be more creative we have to
start not with more content but with
context we have to keep them curious
keep them questioning keep them wonder
thank you
you
