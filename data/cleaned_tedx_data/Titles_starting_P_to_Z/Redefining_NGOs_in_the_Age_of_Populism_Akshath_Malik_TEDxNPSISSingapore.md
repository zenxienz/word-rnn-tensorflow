within the context of politics we are
always food to expect authority
Authority is a specific organization
that is able to control our world
they&#39;ve somewhat a better understanding
of issues that are psi our society now
that is a misconception that is
misconceived notion that we have only
and when you don&#39;t you your type now
because you are admitted for you is that
there is a need for us to challenge
whatever is occurring with initiative
there is a need for us to understand
that means the case where authorities
are not really the best body to view all
the issues that have at hand and a given
point in time now this ability loosen
this particular misconception but of
thought he is the best way to deal with
any situation of them helping they&#39;re
going to yield of you know time and
attitudes in the development or the
manner in which our society when we
don&#39;t communicate so in the early 17th
century we were told the individual
specific blood line would stop how more
individually people who have signed up
more capable of dealing with situations
these people would not expect now that
specific lucid was selected within our
society up until the ninth inning so to
commit resources especially in the book
the Greeks Cathy gets insane indicated
that society will still meet up
individual
that certainty themselves he responds by
example they even really discuss but in
the book we study he said was full of
individuals that were known as to be
servants or individual decisions the
public and to do whatever was needed by
the future it will be passed on to other
and then maybe when secured and we had
individuals that had meet them I
imported these individual for people who
easily capitalists and other which
static economist
over he was one of year until we see a
parallel between these two sentences
that in vitro surviving in the each set
of the only reason that always seemed
themselves being far superior to any
other official out there we go
we see that the issues before the
countries that somehow in terms of
health people that one world
now these visions of a 1945
so now we see that a my topic now I
thought they might be studied through
society we all know what I mean
I thought things about the whole bunch
of mental organizations in our society
in that government itself me know
sufficient government itself you know be
effective
he stood beside me very very fucking
Linda Lou Reed 20 percent of the world&#39;s
population infected
but we need a piece where the
governments are rather incompetent and
have no public policy which is why he
looks for three facts in his piece where
a competence and production has three
little this entire system of governance
and then it is multi pass twixt it well
enough that I pass to explore how we
ourselves as members of society can
solve the problems that come with me not
able to do so in the committee so the
meeting I&#39;m talking about
it was the question I had to begin with
- yet
I&#39;ll just be in the Harvard more than
Indonesian countries where I own you and
on that specific copy and I understood
from that research process and what
about to other continents was the very
fact that W is over there are nearly we
cannot solve the problem it is that
large it is a case where governments are
now 24 which are not even with Kings
with in silence because the government&#39;s
have not resulted to expect huge with
new society
now when I was in China I visited for
the PI that means a loose inside the
native now the group Island has been a
fund that has we&#39;ve over four billion
dollars in the last islands of water to
try this technique and we know that it
helps functioning it has reduce
emissions by 30% by overuse it is a case
where we now see in organization
by activity of only agency members of
society is an organization that it views
itself as being far more effective and
efficient than government as we do
sub-saharan African region now this is
the main shopping center because we have
to understand that now is the time for
step we went on to challenge the
Convention and so much point another
company is to be do something to
initiate that field in the benefit to
meet each and every single now the new
lead on the issue of it is well first I
told you that coverage.i confident that
governments are very low full of each
we&#39;re university because of health care
the cost of implementing world is to
appointment government&#39;s has completely
because of tobacco company you suppress
the symptoms of the daily needs to be a
perfectly many despite of the situation
[Music]
it has intimate relations with countries
which even have good relations they do
not go different ways
and this is that can provide them with a
target particular than the Haggadah
problem with the fiendish augmentations
they have Luna beads and some is not an
affirmative because they can be a
non-governmental organization that
system you can be in about specifically
to be so weddings or be sitting all it
will be operational issues
so for example I thought you didn&#39;t have
the ANOVA table is one of the oven
love it massive amount of research and
development we have developed a vaginal
wing
in the substitute to protection issues
to make sure that some of our society
and the sense the real consequences and
the real ramifications of certain issues
and the mission of policy
