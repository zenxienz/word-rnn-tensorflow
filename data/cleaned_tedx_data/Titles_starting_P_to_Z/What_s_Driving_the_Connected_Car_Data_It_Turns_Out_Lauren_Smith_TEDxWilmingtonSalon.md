this is my dog Chewbacca he&#39;s my first
dog and I love him very very much
but he&#39;s skittish and last year he ran
away from a dog sitter far from my home
but my partner and I desperately
searched through the woods for him we
were limited to the traditional tools we
had our voices our eyes we posted lost
dog signs we got phone calls of people
who saw him running across streets late
at night and we feared that he would be
hit by a car or starve or be lost
forever this is Chewbacca today safe
back at home he now wears a GPS device
the ping satellites to determine his
geolocation everywhere he goes I can
pull the information up on my phone
anytime I want
I get push notifications when he leaves
the house and I can even see his sleep
and activity details now Chewbacca has a
fairly digital free life before this but
as a beloved member of my family who
often decides to run when he encounters
loud noises or new places it brings me
tremendous comfort to know that I have
opted into these nearly magical modern
digital tools to ensure that I could
find him if he ran away again but
Chewbacca did not agree to wear this
tracker he did not consent to its use
and he doesn&#39;t even know that I&#39;m using
a combination of satellites cell towers
and accelerometers to constantly
transmit his data through third parties
but he also doesn&#39;t have to fear
identity theft
doesn&#39;t have to worry about
discrimination at work if his co-workers
find out he goes to synagogue every
Friday or wonder if the very large
number of hours that he sleeps every day
will count against his health insurance
premiums I alone made the decision to
share this information for his safety in
case he ever gets lost again but you are
not Chewbacca you have rights you have
agency that extends beyond basic
questions like can I eat that now please
and you can make choices and trade-offs
about the conveniences you want in your
life
how you choose to protect your own
safety and what information you&#39;ve
generate and share about yourself
nonetheless I venture a guess that
nearly all of us in this room have
chosen to share intimate digital
information about ourselves with
electronic devices that we carry
everywhere we go our smartphones now I
was recently traveling alone and lost my
phone and an almost physical wave of
panic washed over me at the notion that
it might be gone I quickly realized that
this small device fits in the palm of my
hand have become my most consistent and
versatile safety net now we&#39;re here
today to talk about transportation and
here I am talking dogs and phones with
the case that I want to make to you
today is that it&#39;s time to start
thinking of your car in the same way
that you think of your phone but the
safety and convenience features that
connected cars can bring may transform
your life even more fundamentally than
your phone but that the safety case is
even more critical when it comes to cars
because your phone doesn&#39;t move you down
the highway at 60 miles an hour over
37,000 Americans don&#39;t die each year in
phone accidents this is how many
Americans died in car crashes in 2016 so
if there was a chance that technology
could prevent me or my loved ones from
becoming one of these statistics by
sharing the same sensitivity of
information with my car that I already
share with my phone I would take it in a
heartbeat now lucky for us that chance
has arrived but we live in a world where
94% of car crashes are caused in some
way by human error and every day new
technologies are being developed that
can mitigate that error so I want to
argue that given these numbers the case
is so much stronger for opting in and
sharing information with your car then
even your phone which is something we
have all already chosen to do now as
with smart phones your car will need
information in order for these speech
to function and as with smartphones the
companies involved will need to
safeguard your privacy in order for you
to use and Trust the technology more and
more all new cars are starting to come
with these features in some cases the
safety case may be so persuasive that
consumers won&#39;t be given a choice
just as we eventually weren&#39;t given a
choice about seatbelts so the truth is
that yes your car will be learning more
about you but what it learns may save
your life now part of the challenge with
this shift is that Americans have a very
unique relationship with our cars we&#39;ve
long thought of cars as these mechanical
chassis that guarantee our autonomy and
our freedom and often in conjunction our
privacy
[Music]
this heightened expectation of privacy
is reflected in our lives as well as our
laws with new rules around privacy in
the car evolving over time but cars have
long collected data nearly every car for
decades has had an event data recorder
and an onboard diagnostic system but in
the past few years there&#39;s been an
explosion in the variety the
connectivity and the volume of data in
the car these new features are enabling
Jetson like technologies I&#39;ll give you a
few examples automatic emergency braking
uses radar or camera based sensors to
detect if you&#39;re about to hit an object
on the road and you haven&#39;t braked
quickly enough and they&#39;ll brake
automatically eye tracking technologies
can tell if a driver is falling asleep
at the wheel and alert them to get them
to wake up vehicle the vehicle
communication can send basic safety
messages from your car to nearby cars on
the road to notify them if you&#39;ve had to
brake suddenly or gotten into a crash so
that the driver six cars back can know
that he needs to slow down before he
runs into you what&#39;s preventing a pileup
now another big shift is connectivity so
whereas before in order to get access to
the information on your car the
technician had to plug in to a port
today it can be transferred almost
instantaneously to a growing number of
parties you go to cars nearby on the
road it could go through the cloud to
your vehicle manufacturer you can notify
you of defects or issues and it could go
through the cloud to your apps so that
the music you listen to in the car syncs
with what you&#39;ll later hear on your
computer the other big shift is the
volume of data in the car
so autonomous cars that are being tested
today can generate up to one gigabyte of
data per second that means they could go
through my entire cell phone plan worth
of data for the month in less than a
minute now autonomous cars use this much
data because they&#39;re constantly going
through a machine learning process but
they&#39;re analyzing each prior incident
into
to ensure that any mistakes that are
made won&#39;t happen again both for that
car and for any other car in the
autonomous sleep now these features and
many more will go a very long way in
mitigating again the vast majority of
crashes that are caused by human error
but for these features to work
they&#39;ll need data your data so the
question that we face given how strong
the safety case is today is how do we go
about balancing safety and privacy and
convenience and creepiness in a world
where car companies are becoming
technology companies the trade and
personal data and vice versa how do we
ensure that we incorporate best
practices around data and privacy from
other technology sectors into the car
ecosystem the truth is that we&#39;re
already starting to do it courts are
starting to recognize that we have a
heightened expectation of privacy in
digital devices that contain information
about ourselves the Federal Trade
Commission it&#39;s a consumer protection
agency that safeguards consumers against
unfair or deceptive business practices
ensuring that companies keep their words
to consumers and treat them fairly car
makers recognize that you won&#39;t use
these technologies unless you trust them
so in 2014 nearly all of them agreed to
a set of privacy principles that state
that they commit to transparency to
obtaining affirmative express consent
before sharing information for marketing
and to limiting sharing with law
enforcement but there&#39;s more work to do
many of us may have gotten into rental
cars and seen the prior drivers contacts
pre-loaded on the screen or plugged in
our phone to charge in a car and seeing
the data instantaneously transferred
imagine what could happen if you sold a
used car and it had your home address
stored in the GPS and your garage door
code programmed into the buttons so
consumers need meaningful transparency
we need the opportunity to learn what
information a car will generate and
share
and something other than a six-page
legal contract at the end of a long car
purchase negotiation we need choice and
control where possible especially for
infotainment information that isn&#39;t as
critical to vehicle operation we need a
wipe data option and a privacy setting
screen just as we have in our
smartphones now as more and more
vehicles incorporate these features soon
you won&#39;t want to rely on the
traditional tools to protect your safety
just as you no longer just as we no
longer do with Chewbacca as connected
cars become as important to your safety
as seatbelt
data privacy will too soon you won&#39;t
want your loved ones in the car without
it thank you
[Applause]
