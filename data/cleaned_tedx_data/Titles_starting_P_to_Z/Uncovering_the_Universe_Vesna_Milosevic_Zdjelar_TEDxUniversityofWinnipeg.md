so I wanted to start with one particular
question that bothered me throughout
ages throughout my
how how can world look like if you could
see any other dimension that what we can
see three spatial dimensions and another
field of time what if the world had more
than mentions than that what if we lived
for example and I want now to place
everybody&#39;s mind into this floor and you
lived in two-dimensional world where you
can only move within the floor within
that plane and somebody suddenly put a
chair on your world providing that
nobody&#39;s hurt now if you world your
geometers world run immediately and look
for those four circles that appeared out
of nowhere in their world and they
wouldn&#39;t know really what to make of it
there is one two three four they are in
some kind of orientation but there&#39;s no
connection between them what if you
could perceive the third dimension up
here you would see that that&#39;s a part of
an object and all of these are connected
and somebody made that object with the
purpose and with intention put it on to
your world how much of the information
you are losing just by not being able to
perceive one extra dimension so that was
my big problem and still is how can we
find a way to overcome those lack of
senses and one of the ways which is
brilliant is mathematics what prevents
you to do four dimensions nothing really
you can have a line and that line is
one-dimensional you push the line
parallel to itself you have a plane two
dimensions you have a line length a
surface area that you push that line
parallel to itself would be a times a
you push that plane that little square
that you got parallel to itself and you
will get a shape the three-dimensional
shape with volume eight times any time
say now your vision is blocked but you
can do easily math of a times a times a
times a and going to four dimensions and
that&#39;s what we do enhance our senses
every day in every single sense our
vision is really poor so if you want to
see anything in the universe you have to
magnet
right you have to let&#39;s say see our moon
like that magnified or you travel which
we do these days with Cassini spacecraft
close to Saturn and to see another moon
Saturn&#39;s moon Enceladus there but that&#39;s
not a problem with our vision we can
magnify all we want but we do not see
things we do not see all the light that
is out there we do not see cold
radiation from bodies and that&#39;s also
called light that are colder like minus
270 degrees we do not see even our own
radiation if we turn off all the lights
we won&#39;t see each other we don&#39;t see
that what we call infrared what we
really see glowing from objects unless
it&#39;s just reflection glowing objects at
about 600 degrees start glowing down red
and as you heat them further like your
stove element they would go through
rainbow colors all the way until hotter
than 10000 you can&#39;t see either
anymore it&#39;s ultraviolet and hotter than
that is x-ray and gamma-ray and if you
could put and kind of like a boundary
here and here in this spectrum of light
and stretch the spectrum of light to be
something like width of Canada human
vision is a thickness of a human hair
that&#39;s how little we see so what do we
do about that well we have to now
enhance our senses again with something
like detectors of that light which we
can see you see here solar image Sun our
Sun this is what humans see all the
other colors are false colors of lights
which we can see but your dog and cat
can see some of them ultraviolet they
can see it birds as well in insects and
snakes can see infrared which we cannot
see so these pictures here bothered me
the most all my life this is Sun this is
Sun in human visible spectrum this one
here and this one and this is the dahle
picture all the others come from
different forms of light which we our
eyes are not sensitive to so we needed
instruments you know
to precede them this picture here is a
me seen by humans so this is me at Jet
Propulsion lab seen by human camera the
other one is seen by camera either
military or snakes can see it this is
the distribution of heat on my body and
you need now because these are all false
colors just like in this case false
colors which we cannot perceive need
code in order to decode them so we know
that here the brightest white is the
hottest thing and if we decode it
properly you know distribution of heat
on my body here so now look at the sky
this is a region of sky which is pretty
doubt aside for a few interesting stars
around the hunter but look at this now
this is view that snakes might see
because this is infrared this is that
lower temperature than humans can see
stars are forming there that are lower
temperature than when they start glowing
in human visible light so that we can
see them so this is the area of a bigger
star formation where stars of toronto
star stars and making and the clouds
from which the stars are made look at
this image here there&#39;s a galaxy called
for at least a and it&#39;s a dorm in the
galaxy you don&#39;t really recognize
anything special it is very non active
galaxy in human view but if you turn
radio telescope radio waves are emitted
by the coldest gas in our universe you
see jets of hydrogen gas ejected from
the very center of that galaxy and you
see that that galaxy is active we knew
nothing about it until we announced our
senses with some other type of vision
this right here came from the very
origin of our universe that is radio
waves that are all around us at equal
temperature minus 270 degrees and they
were found after the idea of space and
time being connected idea by Einstein
space-time as we
read of the universe space-time the
problem with that idea was not only that
we never before 1905 knew anything about
space and time putting it together
the problem was that space and time and
his idea and it was tested trust me so
many times over these hundred years then
it is actually malleable by matter when
you put it in space-time space-time
curves in the presence of matter and one
of the other researchers not Einstein
himself I said didn&#39;t believe in that
what I&#39;m telling you right now at all
father George Lemaitre he calculated
that if you put matter in universe&#39;s
space-time it is going to be unstable
either contracting or expanding and he I
stand absolutely couldn&#39;t believe in
that he stabilized the equations
immediately but at the same time Edwin
Hubble this is 1920s saw that galaxies
are rushing away from each other just
like something is spreading them apart
so you have a theoretical very strong
theory of gravity at that time and you
have observation that are showing you
the same thing so whether you as human
can understand it or not you have to go
with facts that are bright in your face
so Humanity faced in 1920s for the first
time in history first of all changing
nature of space-time wobbling and
warping in the presence of mass and
second of all that universe was not
forever here it is not static and it
started so then nuclear physicists ask
how did it start how can universe start
how are we here now we have protons
electrons neutrons how do they occur
they occur as energy just condenses into
particles so we have to have in the
beginning very high energy so particles
can come to be particles immediately
bonded to atoms atoms are hydrogen
helium gases these are clouds of gas and
then what happens is you have gases that
are clumpy you have desert and you have
less dense pieces there but what is now
going through those gases
initial light from that burst of energy
and that light we call cosmic microwave
background radiation and that light
actually is in radio waves today seen
because it was predicted by a nuclear
physicist in 1940s that if you now
spread the universe from that energy
apart energy will cool and it&#39;s expected
to be today at about night and minus 270
degrees Celsius that was found this is
the recent picture of it very recent
where we can can add actually measure to
what degree this radiation from all over
the sky that&#39;s the coldest of the
universe to what degree is it uniform to
degree of one hundred thousandth of a
degree and on those values hundred
thousand of a degree
you see these fluctuations that are
colder and harder regions and what are
they showing you the density of earliest
matter that came to be in the universe
because light went through denser and
through less dense pockets and they
actually made imprint in the first light
in the universe which is completely
coherent with our picture of large-scale
today where we are in one of those
clusters super clusters of galaxies and
you see something very unusual in this
picture all of these are big structures
that evolved as universe evolved but the
purplish thing colored it&#39;s some matter
that is needed to be there to
gravitationally keep this together and
that matter is called dark matter we
have no sense to feel it absolutely no
sense we feel visually even audio the
first light from the universe this one
we can even predict that if universe was
small and dense and super dense in that
era
then particles what sound wave is a is a
ripple in particles of medium particles
have to be rippling with space-time
ripples in the beginning and we did
actually record harmonic and to
- harmonics of it so we can even
translate that big bag as we call it
into sound but what is needed here now
is dark matter the matter that is
gravitationally there but we can see it
feel it nothing we can just color it and
say AHA here&#39;s purple but we don&#39;t know
what this is at all they&#39;re not
particles at all sound we you is also to
probe things which we that&#39;s another
sense of ours which is very poor but we
can actually convert into sound waves
some things for example son we don&#39;t
know what&#39;s inside if anybody shows you
a book and says cut out of the Sun
that&#39;s what&#39;s inside ask them
immediately why how do you know how do
you know what&#39;s inside of the earth
lighter so those elementary books with
cutouts of sun and earth I&#39;m like is any
one of these kids asking how do you know
this you know well we really have a hard
time figuring it out but if you know
that there&#39;s some kind of an energy
burst from inside it has to manifest
itself as ripples of the surface here
and those ripples are you can convert
them into sound waves and then analyze
them and here&#39;s the music of our can it
work no that&#39;s okay it&#39;s like boom or
something would be so now our vision not
only that it&#39;s not enough but what is
really crazy is that it is crooked as
well and the space-time that is now
curved and it&#39;s curved in the presence
of mass I will go back to two dimensions
I will bring you back to the floor
because this space-time here that we&#39;re
talking about is two-dimensional and
what we need is three dimensional
space-time curving in a presence of mass
into something higher dimensional but we
can&#39;t inversion that so I have a bunch
of marbles here and I will show you how
when the mass is in curved space-time
now all the orbits are nicely you know
set mathematically to be perfect what
orbits of bodies really are in the
nature and look at this mass now that&#39;s
traveling through space time huh it
curved and imagine now like doing the
same thing curving like that so what is
here in this picture is a specific thing
that I want to point out to you this is
you here on earth so that&#39;s you over
there there&#39;s a huge cluster of galaxies
that is supermassive making huge indent
in space-time and here&#39;s galaxies which
you cannot see because of this
intervening one here but the light from
this galaxy goes in all directions and
few rays are going along the curved
space-time and coming to you this way
what you can only see is the last bit of
white and the maraj that goes along that
last bit of light to you and you see me
Roger
behind galaxy you don&#39;t see galaxy at
all you see mirages all around this
cluster look at the real picture in the
sky
first people thought oh these are some
arcs you know from faulty optics know
they are real mirages of things that are
behind this cluster right here and they
are lens because clusters making huger
than the space time and light is going
curving and coming into your eyes so
that you visually see completely bogus
picture something that is not out there
but you can analyze it the more massive
the mass is there the the big you know
blob is there the more curving will
happens to all the bases of this
curvature here of these images you can
make what is the mass of a cluster and
when you do that gravitational mass that
made this is so much bigger than any
luminous matter can show you dark matter
is right there staring at you screaming
at you
can&#39;t see it but gravitational it shows
it&#39;s there in a perfect alignment
between a lens and that lens the galaxy
and you you would see actually a circle
of images around lenses and these two
are this is real photograph these are
two galaxies that are making a huge
indent in space-time and behind you have
a blue galaxy which is smeared in a
circle like that so that&#39;s to the best
of our ability to interpret crazy thing
that we see in the universe so now how
was that tested that&#39;s the first thing
you have to ask anybody was telling you
this stuff it was tested by the
longest-running experiment is history
from 1920s whenever start of until 2008
when it finally finalized results for
gyroscopes which are spinning things
keeping their axis as steady as possible
and a telescope that is pointing to a
distance star they are going in a
swirling space-time which according to
Einstein has to be tagged by the spin of
Earth around its axis and if space-time
is tagged like that we call it a frame
dragging then gyroscopes have to go with
the space-time that is curved and so
many years of making it in technology
advancement and finally 2004 and 2008
confirmation came gyroscopes moved
exactly according to the curvature of
space-time
absolutely brilliant think developed
from 1920s until 2008 now the
consequence of that is that you have
space-time curving the round masses
imagine yourself actually that&#39;s what I
imagine every day when somebody wants to
spill coffee and the bus hit me with
possibly stops I&#39;m like oh we&#39;re all
warbling in space-time making some
ripples in jello because we are throw a
little bit of quantum physics and say we
are now waves of energy blobbing through
rippling spacetime around and you&#39;ll
have
scene you will not be annoyed by people
that are really annoying
around your neighborhood who wants to
sue you for twenty centimeters of land
thinking there that&#39;s who owns that land
anyway so that&#39;s a big picture that we
have to take from here this is here two
black holes orbiting one another and
they make a serious ripple in space-time
that ripple propagates and here&#39;s
another artists imagination it
propagates as a gravitational wave this
is a kind of animation of what was
received into our LIGO detector in 2015
two black holes 1.3 billion light years
away that signal traveled 1.3 billion
years to reach us the gravitational wave
that is the result of it which is the
ripple of space-time itself it&#39;s not
like sound rippling or something jellow
it is a space-time itself how cool is
that that you can actually envision
yourself really rippling through
space-time this is the sound of it that
was the sound the the frequency of that
event of that gravitational wave was in
human audible sound so it was converted
into sound and you can hear whoop so
that was actually two black holes 1.3
billion years ago colliding and sending
signal and as poor as our senses are we
figured out where we are in a cluster of
galaxies in a galaxy like like this one
here somewhere
right there and we are in one of those
200 billion stars inside of that galaxy
third Rock from the Sun his ours right
there and our ability to look back is
stunning we actually turned back a
Voyager spacecraft and later on to
back in 2013 Cassini spacecraft Sun was
covered by Saturn&#39;s disc and what you
see here this is Earth and the moon
that&#39;s where we are where are the
boundaries of species of you know
Nations of colors of boundaries of lens
we want to blow up this thing the only
oasis of life that we know my point
tonight is that science is very humbling
discipline you can learn to love others
you can learn to cherish and to
appreciate together nice fighting
all of that misery that is around us
because we are all just over there and
it&#39;s a second before we blow it all up
and I don&#39;t want to do that so yes thank
you very much for coming tonight
[Applause]
