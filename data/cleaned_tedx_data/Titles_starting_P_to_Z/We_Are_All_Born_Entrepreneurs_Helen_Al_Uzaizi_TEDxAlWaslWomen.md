because who said all children are born
artists I&#39;d like to humbly add that all
children are also born entrepreneurs
imagine a seven-year-old girl coming
home from school every day
crying frustrated as parents you&#39;d be
very very worried no one knew what was
wrong with this child well that girl was
me my parents were worried and they went
to school and the decision was to bump
me up a year because they said I was
bored what they didn&#39;t realize is I was
probably just not interested and what
they had to say growing up my parents
were always proud bragging about how I
was at school
my grades were never anything great I
was a good student but I was nothing
extraordinary
I got Awards but there were always for
things like drama music arts things that
I loved I later got into a great
university I didn&#39;t get good grades I
actually failed in my first year and I
struggled to get back to school
I didn&#39;t know how I was gonna tell my
parents that all their dreams were about
to get shattered eventually I got back
to University in my final year I was so
depressed I was seeing the university
counselor because I absolutely hated
what I was doing everyone seemed to
think I&#39;d be okay though everyone seemed
to say she&#39;d be okay and I didn&#39;t
understand why my confidence was shook
and I didn&#39;t get it now that I&#39;m a
mother now I understand now I understand
the difference between books and an
education now I understand the
difference between doing something
because we have to and doing something
that you love now I understand the
difference between studying for an exam
and learning
and I look at my two girls and I see two
very different personalities I see two
girls with passion every time they do
something they love I see two girls with
a glimmer of hope in their eyes every
time they do something that they think
is what they love so I decided I was
going to take the world of Education and
change it and after working for 15 years
with entrepreneurs and mentoring them in
volunteering I decided to set up a
platform for entrepreneurship education
for children in the Middle East
why entrepreneurship well I&#39;m going to
just define entrepreneurship for a
second on the outside entrepreneurship
is the winning this and desire to set up
a business and do something that you&#39;re
going to get a profit from blah blah
blah but on a much deeper level
entrepreneurship is resilience
entrepreneurship is creativity
entrepreneurship is innovation
entrepreneurship is empathy because if
you want to be an entrepreneur it&#39;s not
about the business it&#39;s about everything
that goes around it and if we want our
children to be ready for the future then
this is actually our only hope to
instill an entrepreneurial spirit and
children today and for education to
truly prepare children what we need is
to be able to give them this
entrepreneurial spirit
skills and basic financial literacy
because if we&#39;re going to look at
children today and expect them to
survive in a world where automation
artificial intelligence and nine-to-five
jobs are only going to get more and more
scarce then we&#39;re just setting them up
for absolute failure so I&#39;m going to
give you two sides of the same coin
first of all there&#39;s the economic case
and then there&#39;s the human side and the
economic case comes to you from the
world back over 20% of unemployment
rates in the Middle East over 25% if you
include North Africa
and a stunning 30% of the unemployed
well they&#39;re actually university
graduates and if you think about that
and think about the public in the
private sector and what they&#39;re capable
of doing you&#39;ll know that it&#39;s actually
only going to get worse with time but
then there is a human side and the human
side says the children need to
understand the basics of what it&#39;s like
to run a business and I don&#39;t mean a
business of multi-million dollars I&#39;m
talking about a lemonade stand and the
challenges it takes to make your
lemonade in time and be able to sell it
you need to have interpersonal skills
you need to be able to communicate with
people and most of all you need to be
able to deal with challenges and you
can&#39;t start at university you need to
start as young as seven years old and my
daughters are around that age now they
go to work with their father and I
sometimes and they&#39;ll see what it&#39;s like
to run a business they&#39;ll see the
stresses they&#39;ll see the happy times but
most of all what this instills in them
as they see that they want to be a part
of it they want to earn they want to be
creative they want to do something well
my oldest daughter she wants to be a
youtuber and the younger one wants to be
a rock star next week this all might
change but that&#39;s what it is now and
unlike my parents and parents of our
generation you&#39;re not as concerned about
their academic performance as we are
with the skills that they learn and
those skills whatever they decide to do
that&#39;s was going to carry them forward
last summer
I spent a lot of time at refugee camps
in Jordan I was working in a camp in the
north of Jordan you might have heard of
it the Gaza
jurij refugee camp they have dire
situations the educational system is
close to non-existent
they have no public services this is the
poorest refugee camp there was no hope
and everyone thought I was absolutely
mad if I thought that I was going to
work with these kids and
teach them about this foreign concept of
entrepreneurship on the first day the
kids were all rowdy everyone is against
me everyone was looking at me like I was
just a strange person coming from an
alternate universe on the second day the
children were lining up two hours before
the workshop started on the second day
children were there at 7 a.m. waiting to
do what we had started and what was
interesting was that the mothers were
overcome with joy because their children
were actually positive that day they
were off the streets and they were
actually working on their business plans
their ideas and the entrepreneurial
spirit was within them already I didn&#39;t
have to do anything I just had to show
them a path there were boys working
alongside girls gender was no longer an
issue there were girls that were
operating as CEOs of companies at first
the boys were a little skeptical but by
the end they said you know what she was
actually better at the job than I was we
had boys working with her father is
after hours and one of the boys actually
told his father do you know why you&#39;re
not making enough money he said you&#39;re
not calculating the cost of gas when
you&#39;re going to and from your plumbing
clients and I&#39;m pretty sure that made
the father happy the mothers were
overcome with joy and it was all already
there a one-day workshop is not going to
change the world but the first day
changed them for the rest of the summer
and we saw the change as they continued
looking back at my days of school we
were given dates formulas facts all the
time and I memorized them and I
regurgitated them at tests today if you
ask me I&#39;d be extremely hard pressed to
remember any of it I can barely count
and put three numbers together but I&#39;m
not saying that that
not important do I want my children to
learn about science history and math
course but that&#39;s not all it&#39;s like
asking an adult to make a mission-style
meal when they can&#39;t even make an omelet
our role is to teach children how to
think and not what to think and that&#39;s
where the entrepreneurial spirit comes
in because if we&#39;re able to give
children the skills if we&#39;re able to
give children the tools beyond the facts
beyond the numbers and what to do with
them then we be able to set them up for
a future that waits for them I&#39;m going
to give you an example of an awesome
awesome boy Julius so he came into one
of our workshops he was 11 years old on
the first day I thought this kid he&#39;s
just so quiet but he was taking in
information better than any of us ever
could by the end of the workshop
Julius came to me and gave me a link and
he said can you please check this out so
I did the link was for a barbershop what
he&#39;d done is he&#39;s gone and created a
website for his barber and he went to
his barber and said I&#39;m going to give
you this website for free if you will
cut my hair for free for a year
the barber agreed and I think Julius now
has a lifetime of haircuts ready
available time but this is that this is
the key they&#39;re there they&#39;re resilient
they have it in them they are ready and
willing to learn they&#39;re sponges and
when we&#39;re giving them all this
information and we&#39;re just reinforcing
the mold of nine-to-five jobs studying
exams pass graduates and get a job and
our parents had always said be a banker
be a lawyer be a doctor and of course
there&#39;s nothing wrong with us
but if we&#39;re able to go beyond these
skills if we&#39;re able to look at teamwork
empathy self-confidence
community and failure then we&#39;re giving
children a better chance in the future
and this is something that&#39;s very much
overlooked today teamwork
ask any leader today and they will
attribute most of their success to their
amazing team that works behind closed
doors and teamwork goes way beyond
school projects teamwork is about
building a sense of community
teamwork is about the developing empathy
teamwork is about giving back to your
community and if we take our communities
today and want it to be a progressive
one then we need to be spending a bit
more time building teamwork skills after
having gone to this to these refugee
council summer my daughter&#39;s they saw me
come back and say stories you know uh
you know so-and-so did this and my
oldest daughter came to me and said mama
school is gonna start in a few weeks
can we get backpacks and school supplies
for the kids so of course so they raised
money earn some money or had some money
from me primarily but recently and at
the end of the summer we went and we
bought backpacks of school supplies and
we took them to the camps and the impact
that this had on my daughter was just
incredible so I looked at her and I said
mama do you know the backpack you asked
for for school this year and she said
yes that backpack cost more than all 30
of these what do you think and she said
you know what mama I think I&#39;ll use my
backpack from last year this year it&#39;s
actually perfectly fine and that&#39;s the
feeling that we want children to have if
we want to build a progressive society
and education is not there to teach
people numbers because we can all Google
things today education is here to teach
you or prepare you for the future and
I&#39;m gonna talk about a dreaded word
failure
having failed its University having
failed in triathlons a million times and
having failed in mountains and all that
stuff I&#39;m no stranger to failure and we
grew up thinking that failure is final
and failure is the opposite of success
you fail an exam you&#39;re gonna flunk out
of school and you&#39;re never gonna go back
you fail at your sales targets you&#39;re
gonna get fired from your job you&#39;re
gonna be unemployed couple that with the
stigma of failure in our culture and
there is this dark gray cloud hanging
above us I believe failure is not
getting back up
failure is not learning from our
mistakes and if I didn&#39;t get back up
every single morning after having failed
time after time then I would have lost
hope I would have not been optimistic
and I would stop believing that every
day is a new day and if we&#39;re able to
work with children and give them the
understanding of what failure is and how
to come out of it and how to learn from
it then that&#39;s how we&#39;re preparing
children for the future that ways and
the earlier we instill these thoughts in
our children the more likely we are to
nurture third an entrepreneurial spirit
no matter what path they take and I
think every one is going to be a contra
preneur absolutely not they can go down
one path and the path can be to be a
doctor or an HR manager but if you have
innovation and if you&#39;re able to make
something out of that and be different
then you have the entrepreneurial spirit
if you choose to go down the
entrepreneurial path then of course you
need those skills because you&#39;re going
to be going through her dos every single
day and I think all children have their
rights and should be afforded the
opportunity to hone those skills and
nurture those those skills because I&#39;ve
seen firsthand from my experience that
they all have in them and all they need
is someone that&#39;s going to bring it out
upon if everything I said today makes
any sense whatsoever I&#39;m going to ask
you to join me in giving children this
opportunity to take control of their
lives and to give themselves the future
that they are entitled to today
