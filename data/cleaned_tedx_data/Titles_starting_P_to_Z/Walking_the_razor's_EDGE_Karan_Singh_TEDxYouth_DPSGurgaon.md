[Applause]
thank you thank you really thing but
often though whatever you might want to
call it oh thank you having me yeah
thank you a living man thank you stop
now ma&#39;am
thank you for your Ganesh as a pet for
having me to deal really your honor and
a privilege Oh before I move on I think
some of you may have seen me with over
those of you haven&#39;t I&#39;ll give you a
basic idea what I do I&#39;m a psychological
illusionist I mix modern magic with
traditional psychology and if you fuse
the tool you can give the illusion that
you read minds that&#39;s that&#39;s primarily
what I do
Oh before I move on I want to try
something with all of you combined uh so
will you one of the speakers what&#39;s your
name a blush a blush I have a deck of
cards in my pocket I don&#39;t but we&#39;ll
assume that I do so there are red cards
and black cards I take out one color
which color do I take out Yeah right can
you point to somebody not somebody
you&#39;ve come with point to someone your
hand with the audience so oh so the Reds
have hearts and diamonds
I hold hearts in one hand diamonds in
one hand if you have to reach over and
take one suit away with food would you
take away hots okay so you&#39;re holding on
the hot skin again can you point to
somebody not somebody you&#39;ve come with
not yourself let&#39;s just point somebody
else yeah point to someone so oh you
said hots so there are number cards and
picture cards in a deck cards I cost one
set in the air which set to I toss
numbers or pictures number so the
pictures still remain with me again can
you point to somebody again not some of
you come with all right so what&#39;s your
name sorry
pluck so the pictures you tossed away
the numbers that leaves the picture of
the jack queen and king they lie face up
on a table I turn two of them facedown
which ones do I don&#39;t facedown the Queen
looking in F you lift one of them up and
hand them to me which one would you lift
out of the Queen in the king the king so
the Queen remains with you the Queen of
Hearts which all of you as an audience
have narrowed down onto the first ever
trick that I saw was by a man called
David Blaine who did you take for
somebody where they pick a card and it
ends up in his pocket that&#39;s the first
trick I saw and that&#39;s the first trick I
was asked
dubai people and i thought i&#39;d
replicated for all of you but ever now
actually using my deck of cards using
all of you as a deck of cards all of you
who made an independent choice and ended
up on the Queen of Hearts
at this moment that Queen of Hearts
should come out of this pocket sure
however however have you ever wondered
what this pockets for it&#39;s usually for a
pocket watch or keep change I keep it to
hold a single folded up playing card
which just so happens to be the Queen
the Queen of Hearts the Queen of Hearts
is the perfect moment to start what I
have to talk about I want to talk to you
about walking the razor&#39;s edge and
making a career of doing something which
is probably frowned upon more often than
not the Queen of Hearts is about finding
what you love and to find what you love
I want to tell you three stories three
incidents in my life which have happened
to me these are very real stories and
that&#39;s all I have to talk to you about
and if that helps you in any way nothing
will make me happy the first story is my
first memory I was three years old I
moved from Delhi I moved from Bombay to
Delhi and my parents used to work my
brother was in school elder brother I
used to spend my day with my daughter
and my daddy and my first ever memory is
of my grandfather he&#39;d come from
Pakistan off with the partition so he
spoke in a mixture of would go in
Punjabi he looked at me and he said when
I was three this happens to me my first
memory he said but that zindagi may come
Kuro toh esseker o he come kikuchi shiho
Kadam no secure if you do something do
it so well that the work is happy that
you did it that was my first memory and
that&#39;s what I&#39;ve built my life on my
grandfather was somebody who wanted me
to try out a lot of different things he
wanted me to experiment with a lot of
things and I did that and that for me is
exactly like love if you want to do
something anything in your life you have
to love it you could be a mathematician
you have to love doing it you could be a
cook you can you have to love doing it
you could sing you could have to love
singing you could be an engineer you
perhaps feel of being an engineer you
could be an actor you can be anything
that you want you have to love doing it
and you have to find that love and for
me finding that love was a process which
is true for all of you as well when you
hit about eleven twelve years of age
when you start getting attracted to
somebody for me we&#39;re at least so it
wasn&#39;t magic for me my first love always
was football I wanted to play football
for the country which is probably a
naive idea to have an India it is
becoming better now but
then it was a naive idea and with love I
realized when I was in the football that
with love inevitably there will be
heartbreak you cannot be in love without
facing heartbreak even if you fall in
love with someone at the age of 11 and
you end up spending the rest of your
life with them
that person will break your heart more
than anyone else for me that happened
when I was 11 playing football for my
school the mothers international school
I was playing against Amity
international oh I played midfield so I
sort of dribbled through four defenders
and I did the end the goalkeeper tackled
me and I slipped on a prick and I had a
slipped disc on my back when I was 11
years old that was heartbreaking for me
because when I went to the doctor he
said I&#39;d probably advise never ever
playing football again that was my first
love and it got taken away in an instant
and that will happen to all of you for
me that began to happen that realization
of having the slipped disc and not going
to school for a couple of months because
I was recuperating and then sitting at
the corner of a class by the time
everybody else had made friends with

everyone and that came time and 17:8 to
him the entire class was sitting in a
circle with a bottle or a pen in the
middle of them going around and playing
truth in there and the first question
everybody got asked was who do you have
a crush on for me it was football which
got taken away I realized heartbreak
before I realized love for a person and
back then I don&#39;t firmer camp to a place
called Eastern close to kulu-manali
where I met a magician a man named s Abu
Dean Khan he taught me my first two
tricks and herein lies my second story
that little moment of having my heart
broken was completely changed in an
instant by a Sheboygan gun he taught me
the silliest of tricks which I did for
everybody for three years in everybody
knew how it was done and my passion for
magic kept growing but I didn&#39;t really
know where to look what to do there at
least about 15 16 my uncle who&#39;s a
hobbyist he does a lot of things he
cooks he paints he painted his whole
once he makes the most fantastic
chocolates he showed me a trick out of
hobby he showed me a trick where he
takes a piece of lipstick puts it on his
hand rubs it and the lipstick appears on
my hand I pastored him for two hours
saying how do you do how do you roll how
do you even tell me he said do your
research that&#39;s the most important thing
I&#39;ve ever heard if you love something
you have to work for it on your own
nothing will come easy nothing will get
spoon-fed if you love someone you have
to work towards that someone if you love
something you have to work towards that
something because finding love is really
easy keeping it in your life is probably
the hardest thing all of you in your 12
grades some of you would have had
relationships and if they ended you
would have been heartbroken and it&#39;s
okay to have that it&#39;s okay to be there
because it&#39;s next to impossible to keep
love in your life unless you have that
majority for me my uncle telling me that
you have to work towards it I&#39;m not
gonna tell you how the trick is done go
to your research will find a lot of
things I went online I did my research I
found a lot of things and since then I
have been consumed by magic it&#39;s the
first thing I think about when I wake up
it&#39;s the last thing I think about when I
go to bed and that&#39;ll be true for you if
you fall in love with someone you fall
in love with someone they&#39;re the first
person you think of in the morning the
last person you think of just before you
go to bed it&#39;s the exact same thing for
your passion you have to treat it like
it like a part of yourself or like an
entity living on its own and you have to
take care of it that was it for me I
loved it so much that that&#39;s all I did
I forgot how to have conversations with
people so much so that I met somebody at
a social gathering or something they
said hi I&#39;m XYZ I said hi I&#39;m Karen pick
a card that&#39;s all I could do because I
became so obsessed with it and when you
fall in love when you reach that moment
of love and you have someone in your
life who you&#39;ve been with for a while
there will be downsides you will start
ignoring other things if you&#39;re in a
relationships your friend will complaint
it or you&#39;re spending all the time with
your girlfriend boyfriend you&#39;re not
doing you know what doing enough for
this venture
not spending time with me or you&#39;re
ignoring other things you&#39;re ignoring
your family the same happened to me I
was all consumed I was in love with
magic and the thing I began to ignore
was everything else on the top of that
list
was my studies I was in tenth grade and
in the year 2006 2007 and there was a
school farewell that was happening
usually the 11th day it gives the
farewell to the 12th by then people in
school knew that I&#39;m a magician and
performing off and on so they wanted me
to do a show at the farewell so I was in
tenth performing fourth farewell of the
12th on the 30th of January 2007 I still
remember I was on stage I was supposed
to a three and a half minute show ended
up doing 10 minutes because the first
seven and a half minutes I spent shaking
because I thought only should people are
looking at me there are 500 pairs of
eyeballs staring at me right now and I
have no idea what to do but I went
through that and that applause that I
got at the end of that show made me
realize that this is all I want to do in
my life or like I said you ignore things
and with love will come heartbreak I&#39;d
ignore my studies 30th of January was
the farewell 28th of January was then my
play boards ended I really didn&#39;t
concentrate on my pre boards because all
I wanted to do was practice for that
show which happened to be the first time
I was onstage and for me ignoring that
it wasn&#39;t really a big decision from the
30th of January to the 3rd of February
in 2007 I was a mediator celebrity in
school everybody wanted to talk to me I
was the first student in the history of
the mothers international school who
performed at the fair well by being in
the 10th grade on the 3rd of February
the pre-board results came out and I had
27.1% so from being the first person in
the history of the mothers international
school to perform at a fair well while
being in the 10th grade I became the
first person in the history of the
mothers international school to fail the
peoples and the teacher said we won&#39;t
allow you to give the board&#39;s because
mother&#39;s international has a certain
reputation to protect my parents said I
spoke to them and we ended up convincing
them know that please he&#39;s been ignoring
all of this all of this but we promise
that he&#39;ll do well in his boards the
teachers obviously eventually got
convinced I got my board sort of
and I got to go if the birds my father
gave me a proposition
he said if you get 80% in your boards I
take you anywhere in the world the
entire year the highest I&#39;d ever gotten
was thirty three point one so he
obviously was playing a safe bet in
those two months my parents confiscated
all my props all my cards everything
that I ever had to do with magic and I
just studied it for two months while
reading up modern magic online whenever
I whenever I could
it so happened on the day of the result
usually I mean all of you gave your
tenth boards but that was a different
now you have the grading system which is
slightly different from what I used to
have oh I feel old but anyway when your
board results coming out usually what
happens is you&#39;re up all night you&#39;re
texting your friends you&#39;re scared you
reach a moment where you don&#39;t know what
to do next
everybody&#39;s awake everyone&#39;s messaging
dude the results about to come out I was

sleeping the result came up at 8:30 in

the morning at 8:45 in the morning my
mom picked me awake single movie result
again we went online and I rechecked my
results I had 80.1% somehow I have
absolutely I have absolutely no idea how
I managed that but we ended up getting
that and the reason I did that is
because you have to work towards your
love and the reason I did that was
because when my father told me you got
80% I take you anywhere in the world I
looked up online and there was a man
called Wayne Houchins
who used to consult David Blaine he used
to make tricks for David Blaine that&#39;s
what I want to attend that lecture he
was lecturing in Boston in November
later that year I work towards that I
got there 80% I went there and that&#39;s
where my third story lies story that
changed my life because when I was there
I realized that in a room full of
magicians hundreds of them 60 to 80
years I mean 20 to 80 years old everyone
doing exactly what I was doing and I
thought maybe I&#39;m a magician for anyone
I meet but firown&#39; magician I&#39;m just now
the guy doing a few tricks that&#39;s when I
moved away from the general sort of God
tricks I moved on to the more of the
mine
leading the hypnosis aspect of it I
started doing that and in doing so I
gained a sense of arrogance because I
started getting attention I started
doing so much for my love I started
performing in school colleges
I had to drop a year in first year
because in colleges all of you&#39;re about
to enter college you have to enter you
have to fill an exam form which i think
is true for school also I didn&#39;t know I
was through for college so nobody told
me I didn&#39;t fill it and I had one point
two percent attendance in my first year
I realize it&#39;s probably the worst sort
of example that I&#39;m setting for all of
you right now but if you love something
and you&#39;re confident about it go for it
don&#39;t just drop everything right now go
home and said Oh Karan Singh said that
it&#39;s okay to fail you have to have a
bathtub you have to have something that
you completely love to be able to do
that when I had that one point two
percent attendance and I had to repeat a
year that was the most important year
for me I started doing shows I started
walking around the country people
started paying to see me perform and
that was something that I couldn&#39;t
imagine because I was scared to perform
for the mirror two years before and now
people were paying to see that show
which was an improbable impossible task
for me and that was a huge
responsibility as well but what happens
is you become arrogant because of that I
became exceedingly arrogant I started
doing the shows I started performing I
started selling our tickets to shows and
I was 19 years old sitting with my
grandmother my granddad passed away
before he could have a see me perform
today actually rather politically so
happens to be his death anniversary so
have the special for me to be performing
but I was sitting with my grandmother I
got a call and they said oh we&#39;re an NGO
we love for parenting to perform blah
blah blah I said oh I don&#39;t perform but
NGOs and I hung up and my dog is sitting
next to me and she said and she didn&#39;t
really understand what I did for a
living because she came from very
traditional background initially thought
I was gambling because I had so much
good thoughts but as she grew acceptant
of it and she said when I hung up and
said I don&#39;t go for NGOs she said pethor
Eugenia Potter - zindagi micarta her
case Agartha but average is we must
Ferrara nota massive eight much gravity
zindagi make Tomko a beam on a birthday
it denied Japan
never the popular and I&#39;ve lived with
that since never say nor the work there
will come a day inevitably whatever you
do in life there will come a day when
you don&#39;t have work and it feels
terrible
when Sutton ah ma&#39;am asked me to do this
I had another so for this but I meet
sorry I came somehow I just landed from
Bangalore two hours ago and I made it
here somehow because don&#39;t say no to
work there will come a time when there
will be no work and you&#39;ll feel terrible
pathetic it&#39;s the most horrible feeling
when I started doing magic my peers were
envious that you&#39;re performing you&#39;re
doing this you&#39;re doing that how cool
and I thought yes it is cool but in the
summers there are hardly any shows all
my peers are working there earning money
I&#39;m sitting at home crying because I
have nothing I have no attention I have
no friends because of the kind of
lifestyle that I have to live and
because of that you feel terrible
there&#39;s no work there&#39;s no friends all
you can do is sit at home and reconsider
your entire life and that will happen
when you love something the person you
love will break your heart more than
anything else in the world because the
tiniest of their actions the tiniest of
the things they say will have an effect
on you and that was true for me as magic
was my first love off the football and I
started doing that and I stuck to my
idea of doing what I love and continuing
to do it I know it sounds easier than it
actually is
and life for all of you right now when I
was in 12 I thought I knew everything
about everything however that&#39;s not true
you do not know everything about
everything I still don&#39;t know everything
about everything and life is confusing
life is like a mixed-up Rubik&#39;s Cube it
takes yours and yours and yours for
someone to be able to solve this you
have to really be into it you have to
love it you have to understand life to
be able to make sense of this thing out
if you truly love it if you&#39;re
completely into it if you really know
what you want to do life
isn&#39;t that hard I&#39;m Karan Singh magic
Tom kuru to essa kuru he come kikuchi
shiho Khatami Oh secure thank you so
much you can love the audience thank you
[Applause]
