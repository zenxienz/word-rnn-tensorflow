hey everyone okay
so we live in an increasingly software
mediated world and by that I mean
digital processes shaped more and more
of how we experience our day-to-day
lives for me citymapper
and Google Maps are the way I navigate
my home city I can&#39;t remember the last
journey I made without them I mean I
still get lost but it&#39;s through city
mapper and Google Maps I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s anything particularly radical
about that statement so I&#39;m going to
just assume that you agree with me and
while I&#39;ve got you I&#39;m going to make
another assumption that you agree with
the thing I&#39;m going to say next which is
that two of the key enablers of of this
shift to a software mediated world are
cheap computing power which means we can
pack more and more complex software into
everyday devices and give us this
amazing functionality we enjoy and the
second thing being ubiquitous data and
by that I mean data about everything so
data about ourselves data about our
physical world data about how we
interact with each other and what this
data allows is for these devices to
orient themselves in in our physical
world and to interacts with us and with
each other right so those are the end of
my assumptions and now I&#39;m actually
going to ask you things and get your
feedback so quick show of hands how many
people think this shift to a software
mediated world is a good thing even
allowing for the even allowing for the
disruption that&#39;s happening oh I like
this it&#39;s an optimistic audience good
okay and how many people think the
opposite good okay
so however you voted wherever you stand
whatever your position is a function of
two things firstly your susceptibility
to peer pressure from your fellow
audience members and when they raise
their hands
but secondly our more personally for
this talk it&#39;s also a function about of
how you assess value and that&#39;s one of
the things I want to talk about today I
want to talk about value in this new
software mediated world and how we think
it&#39;s going to accrue and I want to talk
about it because how we assess value is
a function of a mental calculation we&#39;re
doing and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not done in
isolation it&#39;s informed by the
conversations that are taking place in
broader society now in order to stop
this becoming too abstract a
conversation because I also want to talk
about conversations and the quality of
those conversations I want to talk about
where we think those conversations are
going to take us do we think they&#39;re
going to take us to a place where this
value that we think some of us think
exists in this software mediated world
are gonna take us to a good place one in
which that value is equitably
distributed or do we think the opposite
now to stop this becoming too abstract I
was saying I would like to ground this
wherever possible in economic value now
I just want to say I don&#39;t think I&#39;m not
grounding it anchoring this in economic
value because I think it&#39;s the only way
of measuring value or even necessarily
the most important way and if I&#39;m really
honest I was a little bit nervous about
putting in anything about economic value
but then I thought hold on this isn&#39;t
just any audience this is a TEDx Brahma
audience and you guys are masters of
nuance and you&#39;re totally going to get
what I&#39;m trying to do so essentially
what I&#39;m saying is you&#39;re the Marks and
Spencers of audiences and those luscious
looking fruits that&#39;s you so having now
shamelessly pandered and just flatted
you I hope you&#39;re gonna stay with me for
the rest of this talk okay so back to
value where do we think the value how
much value do we think this new world is
going to create now they&#39;re loads of
people willing to hazard a guess but in
reality we don&#39;t know it&#39;s too soon to
tell the jury&#39;s still out but because
we&#39;re human beings we never let a small
say
like a lack of evidence stop us from
speculating wildly and then making bets
on the back of that at the very least
even if we&#39;re not trying to to to
predict the future we are looking to
know enough to protect our interests and
if you&#39;re a corporation you&#39;re a
business trying to make some money then
you know the primary area of interest is
financial so I think we can get a lot we
can glean a lot of information about
where organizations think the value is
going to accrue and how they&#39;re going to
exploit that by the kinds of
conversations that they&#39;re looking to
have with us and to talk us to kind of
you know work our way through this I
thought I&#39;d pick a few examples so Sonos
and I robots now so NASA is a creator of
high-end speakers and they just gorgeous
over there they&#39;re just beautiful don&#39;t
you just want one
and then iRobot create these robotic
vacuum cleaners they&#39;re able to kind of
self navigate and clean your home
automatically also really cool now both
of these organizations earlier in this
earlier this year did some things that I
think are really interesting
so son√≠s following a software updates
unilaterally updated its privacy policy
and what it did was give itself more
freedom to reuse to share to sell some
of the the behavioral data that the
sonar speakers collects as they go about
you know piping high quality music into
your homes and in an interview the chief
operating officer this happens
separately these were independent events
but the the chief operating officer of
AI robots in an interview kind of let
slip the you know the company was
thinking about how it might also share
information about the layout of homes
with third parties and again this is
data that&#39;s the the Roomba collects as
it tries to go about your home cleaning
in a completely different sphere there
are shall we say more
brought conversations happening between
tractor manufacturers in particular John
Deere and the farmers who buy this
high-end farming equipment and the the
cause of the tension is John Deere
practice of withholding products
information now because these tractors
are increasingly software dependence
withholding that information means that
many of these many of the owners can&#39;t
decide and can&#39;t just fix their their
own tractors and can&#39;t decide to just
take it to an independent repair shop
they have to go via those people that
John Deere has shared this product
information with and then the third
example I&#39;d like to cites of this kind
of conversations that are going in this
space is in the arena of something that
I think is super exciting and is totally
enabled by this software mediated world
and that&#39;s self-driving cars
Tesla obviously is at the forefront of
this and so we&#39;re just perusing their
websites and I came across this this
krause I&#39;m just gonna read it to you so
please note please note also that using
a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and
ride hailing for friends and family is
fine but doing so for revenue purposes
will only be permissible on the Tesla
Network details of which would be
released next year so few if you can
fork out enough money to buy one of
these self-driving cars you&#39;ll be
pleased to know that you can use it to
ferry family and friends around that&#39;s
fine but if you want to do anything else
say generate revenue from this then
you&#39;re going to have to have a
conversation with Tesla now what I think
is really interesting about these
conversations is what it tells us about
how manufacturers are looking to own and
control the value generating hot spots
that they think are going to emerge and
how they go about doing that is really
really interesting right because the the
means of control their willingness to
enforce this control and the means of
control is software enabled
now what does that mean it means they
get to decide the status of well us they
can decide whether we are going to be
co-creators whether they&#39;re going to use
our data how they&#39;re going to use our
data they will also get to decide
whether we are real owners or whether
we&#39;re just licensees you know we&#39;re
essentially renting this high-end
equipment and if you think as soon as
costs anywhere between 160 and for 50
quid that&#39;s not that&#39;s some expensive
licensee I think same for her for a
Roomba a Roomba crosswalk upwards of 350
quid I&#39;ve done my research I really want
a Roomba right so this isn&#39;t cheap for
that do we just get to be licensees how
do we have this conversation how do we
negotiate the problem of course is that
this kind of power imbalance makes for
tricky negotiation I&#39;m just gonna pause
isn&#39;t that like I know this is like a
life-threatening situation for that
Mouse it&#39;s okay the guy who took the
picture assured us that he saves the
mouse so you can breathe don&#39;t feel bad
but isn&#39;t that just such a beautiful
picture like look anyway okay so back on
points this power imbalance I think is
really bad I think disempowered
consumers makes for lazy manufacturers
its stifles innovation and that&#39;s why I
think the nature of these conversations
are so important and why I think they&#39;re
worth exploring because if we don&#39;t get
it right we end up with statements like
this so this was something that a
spokesperson for sonal says I think when
they were under pressure because you&#39;re
usually the spokesperson is someone you
wheel outs to kind of pour oil on
troubled waters and this seems like a -
feisty a statement for that so anyway it
reads the customer can choose to
acknowledge the policy this is their
updated privacy policy or can accept
that over time their product may cease
to function if that&#39;s not two fingers
from a spokesperson I don&#39;t know what is
and this is the challenge right now you
might think well
you know don&#39;t buy expensive kits but if
this trend continues if we are indeed
moving to an increasingly software
mediated world and my continuous to
assert that we are if that&#39;s what we&#39;re
doing then actually this trend will
continue to more and more sort of
low-end products more and more of our
lives are going to be software mediated
and the power to control that
relationship via software means that
corporations have more and more power to
make us offers that we can&#39;t refuse I
just had to get a godfather close in
there that was really good okay so
having said all this I don&#39;t think these
corporations are evil I think they&#39;re
trying their hardest to protect value
for their shareholders in an
increasingly competitive market I think
they&#39;re a bit stuck I&#39;m not sure they
know quite how to so that have this
relationship with us in ways that allows
for the value to be shared so what can
we do how can we help them and us get
unstuck I think there are a number of
things we can do I think we can start to
think about the whole value chain right
not just when we buy our devices and
it&#39;s in our pockets in our hands in our
homes but more generally we can start to
think about who owns value who&#39;s
controlling it now something really
interesting I think it&#39;s really
interesting and I think you should too
is happening in the United States and
it&#39;s been labeled the rights of repair
move movement and essentially remember
those kind of those farmers I mentioned
earlier the John Deere farmers basically
they got fed up of being locked out of
their very expensive possessions and
what they started to do was to lobby
their state governments to to pass
legislation to force these manufacturers
to share this information in a
standardized way so that repair shops
other than those selected by the by the
manufacturers could repair them right
that means sharing this product
information more widely now they found
common cause with many electronics
repair shop
you know those places you go to where
there&#39;s something wrong with your tablet
or there&#39;s something wrong with your
laptop or your phone because the same
practices are beginning to they&#39;re
beginning to see those practices in all
of these other electronics sorts of
markets as well now there are about
eight states in the United States that
are currently considering this type of
legislation and I think that&#39;s a
conversation we could stand to have here
in the UK - the second thing we can
start to do is to demand systems that
supports more multi-stakeholder control
of data so if you think about systems
that we have now they are they
prioritize the collection of data for
the purpose of manufacturers that
information that you know the stuff that
the SONA speakers collect all the all
the roomba collects is optimized for
irobot and for son√≠s right no-one&#39;s
really thinking yet about what you might
want to use with that data or how you
might choose to share that data or how
other people in this bigger value stream
because this is what it&#39;s really about
it&#39;s about control and ownership and how
we get value from just the benefits of
this software mediators world no one&#39;s
yet thinking more broadly than the
manufacturers and I think that&#39;s
something we can start to do and I think
there are opportunities for us to do
that because we are moving increasingly
in Birmingham&#39;s definitely moving
towards becoming a smart city now as
that happens your City my City of London
is going to be increasingly littered
with devices gathering and collecting
that infecting information these small
pieces are loosely joined so this
Internet of Things are going to be
creating new value hubs and I think we
can ask the question who&#39;s going to own
those hubs and who&#39;s going to control
the value that flows through them and
then the last thing I think we can do is
just start to be more upfront and asking
the economic question how are you
actually going to make money out of this
because if we think about this mindsets
that every company has to be a data
company every business has to be a data
business we can see that that&#39;s the
thinking that you&#39;re driving this
hoovering up of data the
this rush to control these value
hotspots we should ask ourselves are you
really going to make money out of this
because as of 2016
advertising spends in the UK accounted
for what about on less than 2 percent of
GDP and yet so many businesses will have
in their business plans and vision
statements about how they&#39;re going to
generate all this revenue from selling
data to advertisers really how many of
these these data businesses can this
industry segment supports and if that
data isn&#39;t going to be used for sale to
advertisers what&#39;s it going to be used
for instead because this sea of data
will get used for something I started
this talk talking I started this talk
saying I think we&#39;re increasingly moving
to a software mediated world I assumed
you agreed and I&#39;m on stage and you&#39;re
not so you can&#39;t you can&#39;t say otherwise
I still think that I still think that we
are moving to this software mediated
world and I think there is so much value
the that there&#39;s so much potential here
but I think that potential will be so
much better realized if when we
transitioned as we transition to this
world if we are co-creators if we are
value sharing and I think the
conversations were having about that
will help shape that reality I hope we
can start to have better conversations
thank you
