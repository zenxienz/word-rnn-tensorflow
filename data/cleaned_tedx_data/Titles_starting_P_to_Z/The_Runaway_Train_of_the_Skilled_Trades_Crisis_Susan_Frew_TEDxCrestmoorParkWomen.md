we have in our country a huge crisis a
runaway train that is headed at us at
lightning speed that no one can control
and I am here to tell you about this
problem because I live it every single
day and so does everyone in my company
as well as thousands of contractors
around the United States in 2012 I was a
business coach and I met and married the
love of my life who happened to be a
plumber and then sunshine plumbing
heating air was born I&#39;m the daughter of
a carpenter so I&#39;ve always been
comfortable in the blue collar world and
in fact in my coaching practice I had
unintentionally coached seventeen
different trades so clearly God was
setting the stage for me to be in the
plumbing business but it wasn&#39;t before
long when I realized we had a huge
problem we had some great guys working
for us but when we needed more here
comes the problem because we would run
ads and more ads and so on and so forth
and put out flyers and offer referral
fees and no one would show up we even
put out a two thousand dollar sign-on
bonus to find out that a competitor had
a ten thousand dollar sign-on bonus a
little company like ours just couldn&#39;t
compete it was absolutely insane after
that after about a year I joined the
Plumbing Heating Cooling Contractors
Association and joined together with
thousands of other contractors around
the country just like us who were having
the same problem because they were doing
great things legislatively they were
lobbying our government for funds for
trade and vocational education they were
putting together apprenticeship programs
and online training because we needed
workers and we needed to find a way to
solve this problem but why is this
problem happening and I will tell you
why so we have what&#39;s known in our
country right now is a skills gap so for
the last 20 years we have pushed all of
our kids to go to college go to college
get a four-year degree
whether it was a good fit for them or
not and so what&#39;s happening is
everyone&#39;s walking around with a degree
and maybe not finding a job but in the
meantime our trades have been overlooked
and ignored and now we have a giant
shortage so get ready for this because
here&#39;s the number 1 million workers a
million in the next three to five years
will be missing from our workforce so
what does that mean to us as Americans
it means a lot of things and none of
them are good and you are not gonna like
this but here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen
if you need some work done in your house
or you want to build a building or
whatever it is that you want to do
pertain to the construction all the
trades not just plumbing you&#39;re gonna
have to wait you&#39;re also gonna have to
pay a lot more money nobody likes to pay
more money for things do they I know I
don&#39;t everything I where it comes from a
thrift store so I don&#39;t like paying
retail for anything never mind my
services at home when I was in school I
had the opportunity to go to cooking
school in the afternoon so I went to
high school in the morning cooking
school in the afternoon but those
programs hardly exist anymore and by the
way this is the first time my husband is
hearing about this cooking school so if
we can keep this between us I would
really appreciate that because I&#39;ve been
trying to keep that to myself for quite
some time so what&#39;s happening also is
our baby boomers the largest workforce
population are aging out of the system
and we don&#39;t have enough workers coming
in to fill this gap and here is the
problem
ok so 20% of our workforce is aging out
we don&#39;t have new people coming in so
what are we going to do
according to national statistics skilled
trade workers have the hardest job to
fill in our society right now the
hardest and I know that and what&#39;s
happening and why you will be paying
more as well is that the salaries are
going to rise because we don&#39;t have
enough workers so last year when we were
working on our strategic plan I observed
that 80% of our clients for women
and I said well I wonder if those women
would like to have a woman technician
come to their house might be pretty cool
right maybe if I wanted subdue your
feeling maybe a little different level
of trust and then I started digging in
and looking at some statistics and I was
shocked this is what I found out okay
less than 1% of women are in HVAC that&#39;s
heating ventilating and air conditioning
okay if you want to be cool or warm you
need HVAC less than 2% are plumbers
think about it we didn&#39;t have any
plumbers what your sanitary conditions
would be like imagine that for a moment
electricians they&#39;re doing a little bit
better apparently electricians are a
little sexier than some of the other
trades carpenters not so much my dad was
a carpenter it was an honourable
wonderful position sheet metal workers
doing a little bit better because
they&#39;ll kind of lumped in with
manufacturing so that number is a little
bit off and then electrical power line
installers not so much and I started
thinking why if there&#39;s 200,000 or
better women in our armed forces and
more than 15% of women are in law
enforcement why aren&#39;t they in the
trav√©s well I&#39;ll tell you why not this
is why because our society has said that
trades are man&#39;s job they&#39;re not fooling
our society has also said that if you
don&#39;t have a four-year degree that
somehow you&#39;re not a success that is a
lie it is a lie and I started wondering
what if we could fill some of these
million jobs with the right woman what
if she was out there and the problem is
is that she doesn&#39;t even know that these
jobs are available and in my research I
found free money
I found scholarships and grants and
funds not loans where a woman could do
an earn as you learn
apprenticeship she could get paid
for education by a variety of
associations and organizations out there
and start earning like fifty thousand
dollars a year right away maybe college
is the next step maybe a woman could get
a great job in the trades
start earning money money was zero black
and then maybe should go back to college
later because maybe she wants to be a
business owner or maybe she wants to be
a project superintendent or an engineer
all of those things are still on the
table but let&#39;s take a look at the
traits and let&#39;s hear what my friend
Linda has to say about her life in the
trees I mean she is also a business
owner hello my name is Linda Hudak and
I&#39;m a licensed plumbing contractor here
in the state of Ohio I&#39;ve been in the
trade for about eleven years now and
I&#39;ve been an owner operator since late
2010 and I absolutely love what I do
Plumbing has enabled me to be a problem
solver for my clients and I&#39;m very
passionate about that it&#39;s very
rewarding to be the first person your
customers call as far as plumbing goes
it&#39;s one of the most important trades
one of the top three we protect the
health of the nation without us the
world as we know it ceases to exist
there will always be job security and
the financial opportunities are amazing
both as employees and as business owners
so if you haven&#39;t thought about becoming
a plumber do a little bit of research
give it a shot there&#39;s something in it
for everyone now she&#39;s gone to business
school and she is a master plumber isn&#39;t
that inspirational but let me tell you
something else yes give her a hand she&#39;s
a superstar but let me tell you
something else about the trades today
it&#39;s no longer about brawn and life it
is about customer service it is about
managing your clients and making them
happy
it is about strategic thinking and
critical skills it&#39;s about technology in
fact we&#39;re entirely paperless at our
company if you did not have technology
skills to come and work for our company
you wouldn&#39;t work out very well and it&#39;s
also changing the way that we do
business
we have patented and Trademark a product
video plumber we can now do a video
estimate via video feed while you&#39;re
sitting at your house and we&#39;re in our
office you don&#39;t need to wait for us to
come out because we&#39;re in a microwave
society you want your estimate now so we
figured out a way to do that for you
in addition let&#39;s look at some of our
tools so the boil at two boilers that
you see here were installed by our
company in the last year the one on the
Left was done by a master craftsman
which we refer to as a boiler genius I
refer to as my husband and it&#39;s taken
million it&#39;s taken him dozens of hours
to do this project incredible skill
incredible experience to do this project
but one on the right was done by a four
year plumber with training from the
master using a new technology so now we
can use technology these are is a new
kind of fitting and this is a new tool
that&#39;s used in a lot of different trades
now not just plumbing a look instead of
using a flame this is how I feel type
done and done easier to use and a
curling iron I say because I can&#39;t burn
myself so that is the technology this is
the world that we&#39;re living in this is
an incredible opportunity and let&#39;s just
hear from one more young lady who is now
in the trades and was incredibly happy
you could drive around town and show
your children this is what I have done
my eight year old her eyes just lit up
like my mom&#39;s helped do this and it&#39;s
it&#39;s an amazing feeling I&#39;m happy every
day I come to work I come to work very
excited to get my boots on get my vests
on jump in the truck and just do what I
need to do this crisis is coming like a
runaway train but you know what
we can change this we can counselors
teachers parents unions trade
associations we need to teach our
daughters and our sisters that it&#39;s more
than okay it is
awesome to be into the trees me and do
this and we can solve this problem
together
can do it
