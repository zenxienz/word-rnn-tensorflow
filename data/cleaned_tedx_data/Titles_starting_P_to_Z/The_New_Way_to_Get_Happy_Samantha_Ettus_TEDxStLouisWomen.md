my path to understanding happiness began
when I arrived at Harvard Business
School in 2000 we were asked to self
divided into study groups that would
meet each morning before school so I
went up to the first group of students
and asked if I could join them and they
asked me about my accounting and Finance
skills I had none I thought isn&#39;t that
what we&#39;re here to learn then he went
over to the next group and they let me
in only the next day they kicked me out
when they discovered they had too many
people I soon realized that I was going
to be the kid that got picked last in
dodgeball every single time and that was
my intro to business school and let me
tell you getting picked last as an adult
hurts just as much as it did in the
fourth grade
this continued for a while until I found
three other students and our unlikely
lot became a study group of misfits but
there was something that I was really
good at I could spot the CEOs who came
through to speak to us I could spot the
ones was a spark beyond their job title
and with my peers there were so many of
them that were passed over as uncool or
unusual and I could spot the stars among
us so upon graduating I will tell you
that anytime to this day that someone
mentions just kind of cash flow I get
hives but if you mention if you mention
leadership I get goosebumps I&#39;m going to
take a sip of water
much better thank you soap on graduation
I started a firm to focus on those CEOs
and executives who came through the ones
with the spark and my timing couldn&#39;t
have been better I launched a branding
firm where I help them with their
speeches and their press and everything
having to do with their personal brands
and the best part was at the time it was
the early 2000s and there was an
explosion of media channels that all
needed content for their cable news and
the internet and so they needed these
experts they needed the celebrity chef
the celebrity CEO and that was who I&#39;ve
represented and this was the birth of
personal branding pretty soon I became
their chief confidants and that was my
sweet spot The New Yorker and me didn&#39;t
just walk fast and talk fast I solved
problems fast you know you standard
hairstylist chair and you spill your
dark deep secrets that was me it wasn&#39;t
just my job but it was my passion but
after a while I noticed something no
matter how hard these people worked
there was something holding them back it
was an invisible brick wall it wasn&#39;t
about more achievements or more press it
was the other things going on in their
life for the CEO it was a lost
connection to her husband for the chef
it was extreme loneliness for the
Olympian it was parenting trouble and
for the doctor it was financial stress
it wasn&#39;t about their workout routine or
their leadership style it was about the
other areas of their life
it wasn&#39;t about achievement it was about
fulfillment they were leading on
fulfilling lives
aha so I had identified the problem well
15 years later 15 years of this journey
I&#39;ve now worked with thousands of people
I&#39;ve worked with administrative
assistants and engineers people getting
back into the workforce and recent
college graduates and I have found that
this problem stretches among all of us
we say when he proposes I&#39;ll be happy if
I lose 10 pounds I&#39;ll be happy if I
could just afford that house I&#39;ll be
happy when I get into law school I&#39;ll be
happy we&#39;re swimming to an ever moving
buoy and this problem extends to the mom
who / parents the dad who / coaches your
workaholic boss we are all aiming for
something that we can&#39;t get to so what
to do about it
well here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned this is
not about achievements this is not about
more accolades this is not about just
focusing on one or two areas of your
life so you can really perfect them it&#39;s
not about just working and working out
it&#39;s not about just being with your kids
and your partner and focusing on them
it&#39;s about embracing all seven areas of
your life your health your career your
hobbies your community your friends and
your relationship it&#39;s about your family
it&#39;s about all seven slices the the most
fulfilled people among us are those that
are involved in all of those areas now
when you hear that you might think sure
of course career is super important I
have to feed my family and health is
really important but hobbies and friends
and community well a 2006 study of
breast cancer patients showed that those
with 10 or more friends had a four times
higher survival rate than those with
less than 10 friends then they did the
same study with partners
and they found that partners had zero
impact on survival rates now I&#39;m not
throwing your partners under the bus I
am a little bit but your friends could
save your life so say yes to that girls
night out okay you&#39;re doing it for your
whole family and when it came to hobbies
social scientists put heart monitors on
a hundred people while they were doing
their hobbies and they found that their
heart rates dropped 34% while doing a
hobby and their sadness levels dropped
18% and these effects lasted hours
beyond the hobby they mirror the effects
of exercise so there are no optional
slices you need all of them but what&#39;s
holding us back well the media the media
tells us that we should have a scale
work-life balance but for a scale to be
in balance you have to spend equal time
at work and at home and if you have a
thriving career you&#39;re never doing that
so you fail then we&#39;re told to juggle
who here has ever tried to have a
conference call with a toddler in the
room juggling is just not possible so we
fail and then we&#39;re told we can either
have it all or we can have nothing again
we fail anytime we are striving for an
unattainable ideal were failing and that
leads me to perfection we&#39;ve all done it
we see the woman in line ahead of us at
Starbucks or in the playground or in the
boardroom and we say she has a better
life than I do
she&#39;s healthier wealthier she is a
better career a better body a hotter
husband&#39;s a life I want but life is not
an ala carte menu it&#39;s a package deal
and if you had her treasures you would
also have her troubles if you had that
body you might be battling melanoma if
you had that career you might be
involved in a three-year lawsuit so it&#39;s
not about
iving for these other other people&#39;s
lives in the age of Facebook it&#39;s easier
than ever to compare our lives to other
people&#39;s highlight reels so what happens
when we replace perfection with
participation suddenly it&#39;s about
attendance in every slice it&#39;s about
going to dinner with a friend even if
you&#39;re leaving a messy house behind
it&#39;s about forgiving yourself for
forgetting things and it&#39;s about giving
yourself permission to be imperfect
we are finally giving you that
participation trophy it&#39;s just about
showing up for every slice and if
perfection has a partner it&#39;s guilt if
perfection is our roadblock to
fulfillment guilt is a predator eating
you alive of all the women I interviewed
for my last book from Shonda Rhimes to
Gayle King to sally Krawczyk they spent
almost no time feeling guilty guilt is
only a predator when you were with your
friend last time you went out with a
friend what if I told your friend only
showed up out of guilt how would that
make you feel any recipient of our
guilty decision is a victim and it&#39;s
impossible to feel present when we&#39;re
feeling guilty if you&#39;re at work but you
feel like you really should be home then
you&#39;re not really present at work and if
you are at home and you feel like you
should really be on that conference call
you&#39;re not really present with your
family I know this firsthand last year I
was on my book tour it was November 1st
and my daughter Ruby my middle child was
home sick and you know how hard it is to
leave a sick child behind but I got her
settled and I got to the airport and I
was determined to just focus 100% on my
work I was going to Minneapolis so I get
on the plane really focused and suddenly
my phone rings
and I didn&#39;t even know phones could ring
on an airplane and I was in coach middle
and everyone&#39;s staring at me how who&#39;s
this person with the phone ringing and I
looked down and it&#39;s my child&#39;s school
so I pick up and it&#39;s not just school
but it&#39;s my older daughter Ella she said
mommy it&#39;s November first and you forgot
to order me lunch and if you forgot to
order me lunch you probably forgot
Bowens lunch - that&#39;s her kindergarten
brother so here I was in the air with
two starving children and one sick child
and I was going to give a talk on
work-life balance across the country
talk about impostor syndrome so the
teacher gets on the phone and she said
don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll feed the kids Jesus so
that&#39;s a my kids had cheez-its for lunch
and I implore you to save the guilt for
those cheese at moments okay because
that was a day I deserve to feel guilty
so now that we&#39;re gonna abandon the
guilt and the quest for perfection we
can really dig into our slices and
what&#39;s important to realize is that all
of your sizes of slices are gonna change
over time you probably don&#39;t have as
much control over your time as you think
you might have a sick parent and that
takes time
you might have to earn two incomes to
feed your family and that takes time you
might have decided to live in a
beautiful neighborhood with great
schools but a really long commute from
work and that takes time how we allocate
our time is usually based on long-term
decisions we don&#39;t have much control
over instead it&#39;s about just
acknowledging each slice even if it&#39;s
just a sliver today in the career slice
it might be it&#39;s setting a goal so it
might be you know going to a networking
event once a month and with your partner
it might be setting a sign beside 20
minutes a day just to catch up which can
do wonders for your marriage with your
parenting it might be just an hour
tech-free a day where you&#39;re really
focused on your kids it might be going
to the book club
even if you have
read the whole book it&#39;s about
participating in each slice and once you
set a goal to each slice that&#39;s when
they really start existing at goal in an
action item that&#39;s all it takes these
seven slices are your foundation for a
fulfilling life and the great thing
about applying the pie method to your
life is that you&#39;ll feel a whole lot
lighter we&#39;ve all done it we lie in bed
at night and we have a rotisserie of
worries right you&#39;re worried about the
upcoming presentation at work and your
sick dog and the fight you had with your
partner and we worry and worry when you
apply the pie method to the rotisserie
suddenly gratitude is baked into your
pie because it&#39;s impossible not to
acknowledge all of your slices and there
you&#39;re gonna find ones that are going
well and suddenly you can be grateful
for your supportive group of friends or
your amazing kids and listen your life
is gonna be messy sometimes multiple
times all in the same day the most
delicious pies
are not the store-bought perfect looking
ones they&#39;re the messy gooey dripping
over the side ones and that&#39;s what your
life is supposed to look like it&#39;s about
embracing all seven slices of your life
it&#39;s about giving enough oxygen to each
one so that they start living you have
all the ingredients you need you have a
complete life and that&#39;s what fulfilment
is all about and that is what&#39;s gonna
make you happy thank you
