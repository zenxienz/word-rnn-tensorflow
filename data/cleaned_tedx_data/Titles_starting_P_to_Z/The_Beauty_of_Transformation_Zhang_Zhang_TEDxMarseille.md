last summer bill thumpeka asked me to
perform two of his favorite Leonard
Cohen songs during the final flight of
Solar Impulse on July 25th 2016 one day
before the final landing of the
around-the-world voyage of Solar Impulse
guitars Leopoldo jenolan and I were in
the Mission Control Center preparing for
this live performance surrounded by all
this amazing technology I was standing
there holding my violin a few pieces of
old wood some horsehair put together by
glue
well the Solar Impulse energy I mean
technology is the most amazing
innovation of our era the design of the
violin is more than 500 years old
talk about sustainable design my violin
is more than 130 years old but the tree
that it once was will be much older
still this beautiful wooden box was able
to offer a gift of music to Vietnam pika
flying inside the futuristic solar plane
century-old technology it&#39;s brand-new
innovation both our design successes a
testimony to our human ingenuity
whenever we mention the word exploration
the often the images of the North or
South Pole would appear wild jungles
vast deserts open oceans ice cap
mountains new frontiers the deep unknown
but there are other kinds of
explorations such as taking something
that is familiar and available and
transforming it into something new with
lasting impact
all violins begin life as a tiny seed
growing from the earth nurtured by the
Sun until someone decided to give it a
voice and then suddenly all trees are
potential violins able to offer music
the Solar Impulse technologies bunch
more complex but perhaps in the very
beginning of the idea was not so
different from the first master duty a
contemplating a forest
I imagine be a tropical elder Borschberg
looking at the Sun and exploring how to
harness its energy into a perpetual
power capable of global transportation
exploration is not only the discovery of
the unknown but also the reinvention and
transformation of what we already know
today I would like to share with you my
own explorations in music I have been
playing music before I could walk
not because I was one of these genius
children with a natural capacity to play
an instrument but entirely due to a very
ambitious father and my inability to
rebel efficiently against his
determination of trying to create some
sort of superstar I resisted really I
did as a two-year-old as a six-year-old
as a ten-year-old I will spare you
the gruesome details of our family life
but in the end either side achieved
victory he did not realize his dream of
creating a champion famous stage puppet
able to bring him prestige and acclaim
as the creator
nor did I succeed in my resistance of
not
coming a violinist I was / through the
usual classic procedures hours of daily
solitary practice private lessons
competitions summer music camps playing
for famous musicians bigger competitions
bigger summer camps I did not enjoy this
process at all not the isolation of the
training nor the constant pressure being
compared to others as if we were horses
being trained and judged for our racing
capabilities it felt like running a
marathon with no finish line trying to
catch up to those who were ahead and
hoping not to be overtaken by those who
came after I was taught to imitate and
worship great performers and famous
contemporaries those real child
prodigies who had achieved much greater
commercial success at the same age that
is what I thought playing the violin was
all about and I did not like it when I
was 18 years old I had the great fortune
of meeting my mentor met her Sergey Luca
who taught me over the course of seven
years not only the art of violin
performance but more importantly why
music is worth devoting our lives to he
used to shout during her lessons
stop playing the violin played the music
he did not allow his students to enter
competitions he said I&#39;m here to teach
you music now to create some product for
the commercial market
thanks to mr. Luca finally I discovered
that playing an instrument is not for
the purpose of obtaining fame being an
instrumentalists is to share music with
others our profession can be a noble one
translating the beauty of the musical
arts into live performances and
sharing this beauty with the world in
the year 2000 I joined the Lorca&#39;s
Philharmonic the Monte Carlo one of the
oldest orchestras in Europe I was very
happy to be part of this prestigious
Symphony Orchestra at the same time was
very curious also to discover new
horizons as a musician I started to
learn and play with musicians from very
different musical backgrounds jazz
musicians reggae musicians rock
musicians two years later I formed my
own band and we had a regular gig on
Wednesday nights in the Rask ass bar I
see there people who was been yes yes I
well the rest Gaspard is mostly known
for being inside a Formula One circuit
so we had this regular gig now my
classical colleagues looked down on my
intramural Activities to them I was a
ligand one lady colleague said to me
when there was some disdain so you&#39;re
now playing in restaurants she said I
answered no it&#39;s much worse I play in a
bar people go there to drink maybe it&#39;s
because I was trying to retaliate
against all this tyranny that I suffered
through childhood you know it&#39;s music
stand metronome partitions lessons I
wanted to explore beyond the established
frontiers what I thought a classical
musician can do besides my weekly bar
gigs I I also joined a circus and
sharing music with different people
beyond the classic traditional concert
stage was extremely exciting and
liberating and it was encouraging too
because I&#39;m the more I explored the more
I wanted to do new things in 2005 I
created my first charity concert join in
the global movement of solidarity
to help tsunami victims in Southeast
Asia the revenue from our concert was
able to give some concrete aid to some
of those in need and this was a turning
point for me
if musical concerts are able to generate
positive impact concrete aid to our
society why do we not do charity musics
all the time not only is isolated unique
events after some terrible tragedy or
disaster but every day all the time
because they&#39;re worthy projects all over
the world near us far from us everywhere
but then we had a practical problem my
friends are said to me you know it&#39;s
very good that you&#39;re very generous
you&#39;re offering your talent and in time
to give your music for charity but you
musicians have to make a living you have
to eat you have to pay rent that&#39;s true
the concept of musical concert is a very
old one every culture has their own
musical language and the musicians who
shared it and the business model is very
simple we share our talent and our skill
and the public will pay to have a moment
of delight beauty of entertainment and
this business model has remained intact
till this day but what if we attributed
a new quality to its DNA the way trees
have been transformed into study valley
violence and sunlight have been
harnessed to help Solar Impulse travel
around the world what if we change and
expand explored beyond the frontiers of
our profession what if musicians became
social innovators and make our
profession make our business more social
entrepreneurial
in 2006 jungle music was born with the
encouragement of the government of the
Principality of Monaco and the health
from a few good friends we experimented
with expanding the to partner business
model into a four-way alliance
traditionally a concert you have two
parts the musician plays the music the
public who buys the ticket now to those
two we added two more a sponsor who
actually pay for the concert an NGO who
receive all the cash revenue from the
tickets the musician still played their
concert we still share our music from
the stage and the public will still buy
a ticket and come and hear the concert
but now they have an added satisfaction
of knowing their presence during this
concert have helped someone somewhere in
the world more and more business and
industry leaders are engaging in social
responsibility projects the sponsors
we&#39;ve approached were very open to help
fund not only a culture event but also
an event that would help our community
music is universal even if we do not
understand each other&#39;s spoken language
we can share music together we can play
music together we would understand each
other&#39;s songs we can come together
around a musical concert and help our
communities besides just having a good
moment together we can actually give
something concrete to those in need as a
child I lived in a 9 square metre room
with my family in Beijing my parents
combined salary was less than
ten dollars a month we didn&#39;t even have
a table so for meals we used the piano
bench as a table
my little brother looked like a cute
little girl&#39;s a child because he had no
clothes for him he had to wear my old
clothes because my parents could not
afford little boy clothes for him and
there are so many who have much much
less every little bit can help someone&#39;s
destiny can be forever changed by the
price we pay for pairs of shoes or the
ticket to a live concert since 2006
jungle music created more than 50
concerts helping NGOs based in more than
20 countries we build a school for girls
in Afghanistan we created freshwater
wells in Africa we helped women war
victims in Congo to establish their
lives and we help elderly people living
in poverty to regain some dignity as
musicians we have a stage we have a
public we can also be messengers and
initiators of society issues that helps
our community even though our art is
often the representation of the past we
are part of today&#39;s society in today&#39;s
world and we must become also positive
active forces for the future as well
classical musicians are not only
cultivated conservators and curators of
the glorious historical arts we are also
creative and dynamic leaders of tomorrow
thank you
