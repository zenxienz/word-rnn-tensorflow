Oh guys thanks so much for having me
personally the dead end the TEDx
platforms have always been a huge source
of inspiration for me
so it&#39;s honestly really humbling for me
to actually be here so thanks so much
once again for having me
so I guess I&#39;m here to chat a little bit
about the stuff that we chat about in
Indian sport every four years every time
the Olympics comes around me as a sports
fan I&#39;m sure you many of your sports
fans probably ask yourselves why are we
not better at sports than we are a
country and and I hear this all the time
even internationally you guys have 1.3
billion people how can we not have
better athletes and I think there&#39;s so
many different solutions to this but but
I have a pretty simple solution every
organization needs to or wants to attain
long-term success every sporting
organization once retained long term
success so let&#39;s just write that over
here
so every single sporting organizations
wants to attain long-term success and
for me in order to attain long-term
success and organization needs to have
two key ingredients and those two key
ingredients for me our culture and
structure
so let&#39;s let&#39;s get started with this
because obviously I need to have some
sort of you know proof to what I&#39;m
saying so so guys let&#39;s just look at the
biggest sporting organizations in the
world so right off the top of your head
a lot of you follow sport what do you
think are the biggest sporting
organizations in the world
FIFA some of the biggest football clubs
okay all right fine fair enough guys
Manchester United it is alright so
Manchester United is the biggest club in
the world
so does Manchester United have a culture
to it yes alright fair enough
I think so too and does Manchester
United have a structure to it right they
have a bit they have one of the best
youth programs out there so that&#39;s
Manchester United they have culture they
have structure now you guys tell me as
sports fans does Manchester United have
long-term success yeah I think that&#39;s a
pretty simple pretty simple answer now
let&#39;s bring this a little closer to home
what is the most popular sport in India
alright so let&#39;s look at cricket Indian
cricket alright guys so does Indian
cricket have a culture yep every single
kid out there wants to play cricket
everybody wants to play for the Indian
team so the Indian team has obviously
built an amazing culture now personally
I think that the BCC High has done an
amazing job at structuring Cricket in
India agreed so does the Indian cricket
have structure yes so in my opinion for
us to have long term success it&#39;s it&#39;s a
very high probability that Indian
cricket is going to have long term
success now let&#39;s bring this even a
little bit more down what is the most
where in India is sport the most popular
what region what one region northeast
yeah
you guys are looking at me say North
East to make sense right north eastern
sports alright so there&#39;s not East have
a culture of sports ok now we&#39;re getting
a lot of tick marks but I think I&#39;m from
the Northeast so I&#39;ll tell you I don&#39;t
think the Northeast have the structure
correct
fair enough so they don&#39;t have a
structure so their long-term success is
always going to be in question we&#39;re
never going to know we might have a
batching butyeah and there we might have
a merry comb but it will never be
long-term it&#39;ll never be structured and
and last but not least and this is
because I am so close to this let&#39;s talk
about Indian tennis right so Indian
tennis now Indian tennis in my opinion
used to have a culture we had some of
the greats my city in Chennai with
Ramanathan Christian Ramesh Krishnan the
omelette Rajas these guys made two Davis
Cup finals that&#39;s no joke but somewhere
along the last 20 years I feel like
we&#39;ve lost that culture so we don&#39;t have
anymore culture I can assure you that we
don&#39;t have any structure so for us
there&#39;s just no way we are going to have
any kind of long term success now guys
just to talk you through a little bit
more about this I&#39;m going to give you
examples of my life and how structure
changed my life so in in 2004 for the
first time in my life I&#39;d gone abroad
for training for an education to the
University of Virginia on a tennis
scholarship now what did that really
mean what does that mean and I didn&#39;t
really understand it to be honest I
wasn&#39;t really sure about the
n-c-double-a system so what it was up on
the screen you can see is every single
one of those things whether it&#39;s great
education fitness coaching nutrition
every single one of those aspects in my
life was taken care of by an expert in
every single one of those departments
now that was the first time in my life
that I had actually experienced what
structure really was because when you
look back let&#39;s look at the education
system in India what happens to athletes
between the ages of 18 and 22 that&#39;s
where we lose out all athletes what
happens unfortunately every single one
of them has to manage every
single one of those things alone and
that&#39;s just not viable now the now the
crazy thing to think about over here is
that wasn&#39;t special for me that wasn&#39;t
specially designed only for me every
single guy on my team had that every
single athlete at the University which
is over 600 athletes they had that and
to think about it on a broader scale 500
schools in over 500 n-c-double-a schools
that have that structure for their
athletes where every single aspect of
their lives is taken care of by an
expert and that meant for the first time
in my life when I was 19 years old for
the first time in my life I was allowed
to just go out and play I didn&#39;t have to
worry about anything and being a part of
this kind of structure when I went to
the University I was a very lowly ranked
junior I wasn&#39;t that good even in India
I wasn&#39;t that good after I went there
was a time that I not only got my
academic skills together I got all
academic honors for my school I got a
sportsmanship award for my school
because the nonsense that I did on court
wasn&#39;t acceptable by the coaches and I
went to three out of four NCAA finals as
a singles player finishing the errors
number one now if you look at it from an
organizational perspective the
University of Virginia when our head
coach was brought in we will not even
rank by the time I was there which is
about four or five years later we were
ranked number one and that was in 2006
and now four of the last five years the
University of Virginia has won the
national championships and that is all
because of that amazing structure that
every single student athlete has to
experience once he&#39;s there so that is my
story of structure and how structure has
actually helped me become successful so
let&#39;s talk a little bit more about the
second the second concept what is
culture so once again guys I was at the
University
and it was a it was a weekend so the
coaches have given us the weekend off
Friday night but I still really wanted
to practice I was really excited about
this new thing that I had learned so I
called my roommate up and I said dude
let&#39;s go out and let&#39;s hit some tennis
balls and he&#39;s like first of all it&#39;s
Friday night there&#39;s a lot of other
things that students want to do on
Friday night other than go hit tennis

balls and it was 11:30 at night he said
man what we going I said dude let&#39;s just
go to the courts and see so off we went
we get to the courts and we have 13
public courts public university public
courts open at all times 13 courts at

11:30 at night on a Friday and I had to
wait because every single one of those
courts was full and that was the first
time in my life that I had experienced
being around people who wanted to be
around a tennis court so much I had to
wait no problem but I was so happy that
I was around a culture that wanted to
play that they wanted to play the sport
and when I looked back this has happened
to me guys this has happened to me when
I was a junior this has happened to me
when I was growing up this has happened
to me when I was number one in the
country and winning medals for India
when I go to a court sometimes I get
kicked off because the senior official
wants to play and the other courts that
are all available are all under lock and
key and none of us can actually access
them and I hope I&#39;m painting a clear
picture for you guys as to what culture
is over here and what culture is over
here and for us to succeed in long term
we need to actually start building that
sporting culture so I guess the next
logical question is where does this
culture stem from and for me the answer
is pretty simple the culture this kind
of culture stems from passion for us to
grow this culture we need really really
passionate people working for us so I&#39;m
going to share a really short story
about my old quote scott mccain scott
mccain was a great caution one day we
had an incredibly long flight horrible
journey somehow landed up in korea and
career was you know 1 or 2 p.m. and we
didn&#39;t want to go practice that day but
Scott was like hey guys you got to go
out you got to practice it&#39;s the right
thing to do just 30 minutes on the court
so we said ok so we all get out there we
practice 30 minutes is done we&#39;re
stretching we can&#39;t wait to get out and
on the other court there&#39;s a little 7 or
8 year old Korean girl hitting tennis
balls with her dad now Scott now keep in
mind this is a 55 year old guy who that
16 knee surgery 16 so he&#39;s probably
feeling absolutely horrible after that
long flight Scott gets up goes over to
that girl for no reason and he starts
teaching her the fundamentals of tennis
for 30 minutes he sat there now keep in
mind my coach he doesn&#39;t speak Korean
the Korean girl doesn&#39;t speak English
and he&#39;s gone out there with zero
obligation but he&#39;s seen a girl that he
thinks that he can help and he&#39;s gone
out then he&#39;s helped her and for me you
cannot have culture without that kind of
passion so that&#39;s what we actually need
then that&#39;s where passion stems from it
was because of this passion and it&#39;s
because of this structure and the
culture that I was put into after the
age of 19
that I became successful it was because
of this that I became the highest ranked
in the in tennis player in two decades
it&#39;s because of that that I won three
gold medals in 2010 and you can
congratulate me but you have to thank my
coaches who actually gave me all of
these opportunities and structured my
life and put me in the right environment
to actually succeed because that is what
is necessary now I guess the next
question guys is how do you actually
implement these things how do you
actually implement cultures and
structures into a society so I run a
nonprofit called life is a ball now what
life is the ball does is we actually
reach out to many kids from economically
disadvantaged areas small rural areas in
different cities different areas
and we actually take sports programs to
them because we think that sports can
play a positive impact sports can have a
positive impact on their lives we can
learn we can teach them things like
leadership we can teach them things like
dedication how to deal with wins and
losses nervous this before exams we can
teach them how to be hardworking and
more importantly we can teach them what
ethics are what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong
because you learn these things in sport
in a very very practical way so that&#39;s
what we wanted to do so that&#39;s what we
do and that&#39;s why we do it
but another way to look at why we do it
and I was in the States last month
talking to a few friends and there they
were asking you about life as a ball and
I said I was telling him all of this and
they said no son why do you have to
actually go and do this don&#39;t you&#39;re
telling me that there are playgrounds
there are schools and there are kids and
there&#39;s no structured playful what do
you mean so this concept was so foreign
to somebody who already takes it for
granted in their society so Australia
America the UK all of these countries
all of this is the norm but in India
it&#39;s not just think about it guys if
we&#39;re running behind in the syllabus in
class what&#39;s the first subject that gets
taken away the PT class right you guys
are laughing now wait til a PD class
takes taken away but and I guess the
next question is why why why sport we
can we can do so many other things right
and and the way I look at this is it&#39;s
very simple imagine 15 years ago all of
us were around 15 years ago when I grew
up so we were so engrossed we were
spending so much time on learning things
like Fox learning things like Cobra
ms-dos things that are 15 years later
are obsolete so we don&#39;t know we can&#39;t
predict what the job market is going to
be 15 years from now as 15 years ago we
don&#39;t know what it was today
however 15 years ago things like
leadership things like hard work
things like dedication having the right
ethics those things were always valuable
then and those things are valuable now
and those things will always be back off
value we can teach our kids in a very
very practical way and we can help
improve their health so and the kids
have fun so why would we not want to
inculcate this in our culture so at the
end of the day for me for us to have
what we want we want long-term success
in Indian sport for us to actually have
long-term success in Indian sport we
need to start working from the grassroot
level we need to start implementing
culture so we we encourage our kids to
actually go out and play because there
is a value to it we need to start
telling them about the culture we need
to start inculcating the structure in
our grassroot level and once we do that
as an organization of Indian sport
Indian sport will get better because
sport it always has been it still is and
sport always will be a game changer
let&#39;s go out there and let our guys play
thanks so much guys
[Applause]
you
