I don&#39;t know how many of you know this
books one of my favorite books it&#39;s a
book called a little engine that could
if you haven&#39;t read the book you should
go to a bookstore and get it because
it&#39;s truly inspirational and it captures
the imagination of all kinds of little
boys and girls as you can see from the
cover there&#39;s a little locomotive trying
to actually go up a small hill and the
actual book has it&#39;s a story about small
locomotives and large locomotives and
the fact that the stronger and larger
locomotives can actually go up the hill
and the smaller ones struggle and I&#39;ll
come back to that it really is related
to the theme that I&#39;m trying to get
across in my remarks today that are
really focused on a crisis an epidemic
if you will that&#39;s going on in our
schools K through 12 as well as in our
universities and also in the arena of
young adults lives today I&#39;m going to
talk about two people on the right is a
young man called Brogan Dulle II Brogan
Dulle II was a 21 year old student at
the University of Cincinnati the great
institution that I was the president of
until just about a year ago Brogan was
somewhat shy but was very popular and he
was quite the athlete an accomplished
swimmer and also a coach for swing for
youth in a turpan area of Cincinnati
Ohio the person on the left
in contrast wasn&#39;t a good athlete and
isn&#39;t a good athlete even today and you
can see that I&#39;m carrying something that
doesn&#39;t even exist today a reel-to-reel
because I was on surprise surprise a
very nerdy audio-visual crew if some of
you teachers know that students in the
a/v crew are actually pretty useful
right because they move equipment around
and help you out back then we would
actually have reel-to-reel movies that
we would help support the teachers with
and I did that that&#39;s picture of me when
I was a high school student
significally younger than Brogan in that
picture there but even though we look
different he was an athlete I was not he
was probably more popular than iOS I was
sort of nerdy and he was really more
well-rounded there&#39;s a similarity
between the two of us Brogan Dulle at
the age of 21 when I was president of
University of Cincinnati went missing
one night I think was May 18th 2014 he
told his roommates who&#39;s gonna go look
for a cell phone that he had lost and in
this day of closed-circuit TV you can
actually see him leaving the apartment
building walking down the hill
he&#39;d his friends have had a fun night up
until that time it&#39;s all on
closed-circuit TV and he never comes
back and so his friends get worried the
next morning I tell the university they
tell the friends eventually his parents
find out the media catches on and
something absolutely amazing happens
which i think is a testimony to
Cincinnati Ohio the University of
Cincinnati that community if you haven&#39;t
been to Cincinnati it&#39;s sort of like a
real hometown it&#39;s a place where people
rally together and look after a lost son
or daughter so eight days went by eight
days that will become more significant
as I talk to you about this story eight
days where thousands of people actually
spanned across the entire city trying to
find Brogan Dulle
well I received a phone call from the
chief of police saying that somebody had
actually a landlord landlady reported
some sort of disturbance in a house not
too far away from where Brogan lived and
when they went inside and went down to
the basement
there was Brogan&#39;s body he&#39;d hanged
himself and the entire community the
entire university obviously his family
was totally grief-stricken and one of
the hardest things that you do as the
president of a university or a principal
of a high school
or a junior high school is have to
preside over a Morial service for a
student who has taken his own life
the guy on the other side me I tried to
kill myself twice once at the age of 14
and once in my late 20s as you can see
my story is a different one I&#39;m lucky to
be standing in front of you today and
indeed to be so privileged to be the
president of one of the world&#39;s great
universities the University of British
Columbia so that&#39;s the story about me
why did I try to kill myself at the age
of 14 well I&#39;m one of three boys
my older brother Memorial was a child
prodigy is a amazing concert pianist and
he had at a very young age he played
with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and he
was a golden boy of music I was the
middle child I was no prodigy in fact I
didn&#39;t even do well in physics and I
think my parents were pretty ashamed of
me my father&#39;s a maths professor and his
son didn&#39;t do very well in physics and
my younger brother can was a child
prodigy in mathematics at the age of 8
he knew that there must be no last
number therefore infinity was a concept
that he grasped at the age of 8 and so
here I was this pretty ordinary guy
flanked by two amazing child prodigies
and I feel felt totally inadequate and
someone who wasn&#39;t really be fitting to
be a member of this Auguste family and
so at the age of 14 I one evening when
my parents were watching TV went to the
fridge never having had anything to
drink grab the bottle of vodka and a
handful of cold medication and I try to
take my own life at the age of 14 thank
goodness I woke up I didn&#39;t know how
much it would take to end my own life I
didn&#39;t the next day feel angry at myself
I still struggled with my mental health
for many many years as you know I tried
once again in my 20s to take my own life
and the second time was more serious and
thank good
in my late 20s when I was already an
assistant professor at Johns Hopkins
University I had a chance to receive the
treatment that I needed I went to the
Sheppard Pratt Hospital and was
diagnosed with both bipolar disorder and
was treated with a combination of zoloft
and psychotherapy and I started over a
period of years unbeknownst to my
chairman the Dean the president of Johns
Hopkins I worked to try to tackle the
demons inside of me and I got better and
I&#39;m symptom free today thanks to them
now Brogan&#39;s story is very different as
you know he was successful in taking his
own life and there&#39;s a lot of good
that&#39;s happened because of what happened
to him and I want to tell you that story
and I want to tell you about how I
imagined a future when fewer and fewer
young students in schools and
universities will advance to the stage
where they take their own lives see this
picture of that book the little engine
that could and won&#39;t talk to you about
it because it&#39;s a story that Brogan
Dulle II would tell the littlest of
swimmers that he was coaching you can
see him with one of his protegees in
that picture and Brogan was all smiles
and all encouragement he would take
those little sort of merchants say just
like the little locomotives that if you
think you can and keep saying I think I
can I think I can that they could be
successful what an inspiration and
that&#39;s what people remember about Brogan
including his family remember I said
that all of Cincinnati looked all over
Cincinnati was all over looked for
Brogan over eight days what a remarkable
family obviously they&#39;re suffering and
they&#39;ll never stop suffering with the
loss of their son but what they did
immediately within the year after his
death was as a family they put together
the organization
called the eight days of greatness if
you look at that picture there of the
nine squares the one on the upper
left-hand corner
our Brogan&#39;s glasses his trademark
glasses which are actually pretty
slimmer to mine
surprise surprise and every single one
of those eight days has a meaning of
virtue an action a value that that
family believes if we all embrace those
over that eighth period days of date day
period every single year they believe
that you can build the kind of web of
support needed to intervene with
youngsters that are struggling with
their mental health and it&#39;s an amazing
effort and I hope it spreads all over
this globe you can see a picture there
of a group of people participating in
the eight days of greatness and what&#39;s
amazing it&#39;s different institutions and
companies would actually sponsor each of
those days and people would think about
what those values mean and how if we as
a collective group embrace those actions
and values that we can save lives the
eight graves days of greatness there&#39;s a
lot more we can do and the question is
why is this important well I can tell
you that I just welcomed 9,000
first-year young adults to the
University of British Columbia
incredibly brilliant students among the
most brilliant students anywhere in this
world and they are amazing they are
articulate they are talented there are
athletes among them there are Olympic
medalists there are probably future
prime ministers in that group but guess
what even in that group of nine thousand
people one in five are going to struggle
with mental health during their time at
UBC and UBC is nothing special it&#39;s
happening in the schools and
universities around North America
everywhere we go this is a crisis an
epidemic that&#39;s why this conversation is
important and I want to ask all of you
to be part of this imagination so that
we can do something like that eight days
of greatness to catch
before they moved to the point where
they try to take their own lives now
what can be done well here&#39;s an example
here&#39;s a story that you should read I
was actually at a a fundraising event to
try to raise money to create programs
and essentially get the word out that we
should de stigmatize talking about
mental health issues that&#39;s one of the
reasons why I&#39;m here today the more of
us who have by the grace of God been
able to stay alive and been able to beat
the demons that are in our heads
the more we D stigmatize talking about
it the more we can as a community take
the steps that are necessary to create
this web of support for our youngsters
for our kids and for our grandkids this
is a book by Jasmine warga my heart and
the other black holes that tells you
about the hopelessness and helplessness
that rests in the hearts of youngsters
that drives the drive them towards ID
aiding and trying to take their own
lives read the book it tells you a
number of things that tells you number
one this is a real problem it&#39;s not
somebody else&#39;s problem it&#39;s all of our
problems because I&#39;m sure all of you
would agree that you know somebody in
your family or your friends families
that are dealing with mental health
issues and in youth and individuals that
have lost loved ones through suicide so
it&#39;s our problem collectively now
there&#39;s a lot of things that are
happening and I think there are good
steps but I imagine a day when every
young person and young adult who thinks
they&#39;re alone will realize that they&#39;re
not the only one so here&#39;s the
organization the Canadian Association of
mental health and they have a program
that you should look up if you&#39;re a
teacher or you know somebody who&#39;s
struggling called before Stage four just
like cancer there are four stages stages
of mental health that start with
relatively mild form number 1 stage 2
stage 4 where it&#39;s incredibly serious
and we deal with young adults at all
four stages at the University of British
Columbia and they are in your school
system that they are in every college
and you know
Kirsti around the world we need to get
this kind of early intervention and
training for all teachers for all
parents for all peers we need this to
get out so everybody understands that
the earlier you intervene the more
likely you are to save an at-risk youth
that&#39;s one example what&#39;s happening in
Canada in Britain there&#39;s something even
more ambitious that&#39;s going on and we
should think about this in British
Columbia and in Canada the National
Health Service in Canada
in Britain is actually pioneering a
program where there&#39;s free counseling
24/7 whether you&#39;re in the village where
there&#39;s a suburb whether you&#39;re an inner
city where they have free primary care
help for at-risk risk young adults and
kids we don&#39;t have that here in British
Columbia we don&#39;t have that here in
Canada there has been a significant
investment in Canada in the United
States but we have a long way to go
before really having a comprehensive web
of support that will save millions of
lives around the world and I would I
imagine and I dream that we can move
towards something like that here in
North America now the other thing that
can be done is that more people have to
talk about this being normal and one of
the most amazing things that happened
this year and you probably know about it
these are amazing guys Prince William
and Prince Harry in their their their
life and hopefully wife-to-be I think
they I&#39;ve come into the mainstream as
celebrities talking about their own
mental health challenges in doing so
they are breaking the stigma about
talking about their challenges if it&#39;s
okay for a prince to say I had mental
health problems and it&#39;s okay for all of
us to say that we had mental health
problems and you can see here that they
put together an organization now one
year one year old called two heads
together one year on so this is just an
update it shows you that with them
coming forward with people coming
together in twos or threes or hopefully
millions of us coming together that we
can hopefully create that
safety net for at-risk youth so that&#39;s
the kind of thing that we have to do
more and more and social media as you
know is also something that is very
powerful with youth and this is an
example of something happened at Oxford
University we have something very
similar at UBC called thrive
these are web-based programs that are
supporting supporting peer support
within our colleges and universities
we&#39;re actually at-risk youth in the
institution can actually come and read
about what exists in terms of services
for them in terms of social media you
can see that if you go into Instagram
and actually type in the hashtag hashtag
depression you can see that
automatically the Instagram actually
provides support for at-risk youth it&#39;s
very important because youth are on
social media all the time sometimes even
when they are depressed or even if when
they&#39;re anxious in the next slide you
can actually see that it&#39;s also true for
Facebook you type in depression you can
see how can we help what are the
resources that are available for you all
of this is needed together with national
programs and institutional programs at
universities and schools to really
provide a comprehensive plan to support
at-risk youth and here you can see that
companies such as Bell Canada have a
program called Let&#39;s Talk and that&#39;s
been an amazingly powerful program where
millions of people have engaged with
at-risk youths and millions of dollars
have actually been raised to address
this problem so I&#39;d like to end by
saying that in addition to all of this
companies institutions national programs
support programs we need you everybody
has to talk about what&#39;s happening we
have to eliminate and dispense with the
stigma of talking about mental health
and each of us have to be educated in
understanding that we have to keep our
eyes open keep our eyes on our youth
shower them with love and take
understand what it is that we can and we
cannot do and when we need to refer
at-risk youth to professional counselors
and with that I&#39;m going to end by saying
going back to that book the little
engine that could
you see the truth of the matter is that
individuals students and young adults
that are at risk of committing suicide
aren&#39;t all little last year we had a
medical student who was an amazing
hockey player at UBC who to the surprise
of everyone took her own her own life
she appeared happy
she appeared popular she was strong she
was not a little engine but she didn&#39;t
believe that she could knit she could
see a talented athletic swimmer and even
a nerdy guy little engines that not sure
that whether they can actually climb a
mountain come in all shapes and sizes
they come in all different ages and they
all need help
and so what&#39;s needed my dream what I
imagine is that we all come together and
we say I think I can I think I can not
just for them but if we collectively say
we think we can we think we can then we
can create a comprehensive Network to
serve and protect and make sure that
they stay alive thank you very much
