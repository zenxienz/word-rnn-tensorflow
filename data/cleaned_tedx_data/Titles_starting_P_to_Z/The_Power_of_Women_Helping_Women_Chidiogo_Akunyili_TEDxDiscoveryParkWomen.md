so my introduction was all about the
languages that I speak but I&#39;ll start
from there I used to think that I was
not good with languages why you might
ask
well it started in secondary school
first day of French class my French
teacher had transferred from King&#39;s
College I was at - college in livers and
she had been teacher to my brother who
she adored and she came and she looked
at me and hope you like your brother
hope you like a girl who is so amazing
and somehow I could tell that she found
me didn&#39;t she
not to accept the sentiment with a slap
across my face why because according to
her I was making noise
I mean think that I was just asking my
friend my siblings to hit me huh a
pencil sharpener the little girl in me
concluded that she was right and there
was some way I couldn&#39;t compare I wasn&#39;t
good so all throughout secondary school
I fell to French and my dream wasn&#39;t an
accident I was I managed but French I
always fail it bus forge the signs of
arson arrests and my society idea right
before my my first year my sort of I&#39;ve
been around that summer the shi-wan lim
French for me I was just attracted by
the idea of going to France as I said he
has some cool if that learn French so
off I went to to France and I arrived at
my school in Vichy and the heart of
France a small town and the teacher was
speaking French speak I wanted to the
work the grounds openness while
and I wanted to scream at her but I
don&#39;t I&#39;m not good at languages speak in
English my house at least I could
understand the question and be able to
answer she must have seen the terror
that anguish the frustration all wound
up and visible in my eyes but she didn&#39;t
budge two months later I was speaking
and conversing in French and this was
greatly aided by the patience of said
teacher and the French family that I
lived with but believed in me and
believed that I could do it why do I
share this story because mindset matters
the stories that we tell ourselves
matter the stories that others tell us
about ourselves matter I could have gone
a lifetime believing that I was not good
in languages denying my gift why because
I&#39;ve been told I wasn&#39;t and it means
hold and believed I wasn&#39;t and I be even
it had become my truth I see people not
in other words or somehow that resonates
right so the title of this TEDx is
building bridges not walls and it&#39;s all
about teaching women about the things
that cannot work against us in the
material world allow me to focus on a
particular element of this theme which
is building bridges to yourself I&#39;m
breaking down the walls of all the
things that do
that keep you from your full potential
and your full potential it is to be
found itself in your truth we know that
the true that will set you free
thank you
so in discussing the making of all this
theme and all the things that work
against us I would like to do a little
exercise because if you would indulge me
please close your eyes
we might make her a little girl the
little girl that was told that she was
not good enough not lives enough not
small enough not skinny enough not fat
enough what smart enough to stupid
almost that first time that you started
to believe these voices as that is
believed that they defined you that you
are about your looks for better or for
worse do you have that little girl in
your up in your mind&#39;s eye what she
looks like how she&#39;s looking at you what
she&#39;s wearing how she feels about beings
all these things about herself he are
your eyes and open open them
this little girl is you she is part of
you the only difference is that we grew
up but she didn&#39;t and she never healed
from this insecurities all those things
told that she was been told that she
isn&#39;t all the ways that she cannot be
believe in the voice of her teachers so
fast forward and here we are all seated
together and sometimes a conflict arises
he wants to be who we are right someone
just mentioned who am i and you know
finding yourself and in being yourself
does that become being someone&#39;s wife
being entitled using your femininity was
mentioned earlier it&#39;s another front
because you don&#39;t want to be too
emotional your power woman and you
should look a certain way all these
things not judging either as right or
wrong but really shining a light on the
danger of those things not defining you
not being what who you&#39;re about so here
we are and earlier we mentioned how why
the question of the age old question
women pull each other down or not while
we of course not all women to each other
now look at us we&#39;re all here to support
each other bring in each other together
to learn from each other but should we
pull each other down
is it because someone else put us down
is it because someone else told us that
we were not good enough and from that
space of pain
we need to inflict that on another is it
because we do not know how to hold
ourselves up do we know how to build
bridges so our power to ourselves so
that we know what it is that we&#39;re
capable of
about four years ago I was heartbroken
and I felt in my heart break like a
victim and I would just want to spend my
time sinking into this victim space and
being sad about the world in my
situation and one Saturday my plan had
been just to be sacked and I thought no
we can&#39;t keep doing this to ourselves
something has to give
so I&#39;d read somewhere about coloring and
how he was meditative and I know I did
my minds move away from what was once
the supermarket got colors got a create
a coloring book children&#39;s coloring book
went back home and I call it four hours
I call it and at the end something that
ship didn&#39;t mean over the years I know
how I&#39;ve come to understand that shift
as this conscious efforts really good
deep inside and what is going on we can
be victims of the situation the
difficulties the challenges the all
parts of life are we all live them in
different ways shapes and forms or we
can take control and say what is going
on and that is that bridge building a
mind it&#39;s me thank you
to build a bridge what you first Claire
the degrees right you don&#39;t have that
building so what are these things that
are not serving you those things are
blocking the road from flowing and then
you start visioning what does that what
can that bridge look like is that
designing and then you&#39;re building
because you cannot give what you don&#39;t
have
you cannot give what you don&#39;t have so
what is it as decide what is the voice
that is telling you that you what the
less shaping your narrative of who you
are and what it is that you can
contribute this world watch that voice
because it shapes so much of our reality
over the years of the practice of mine
has been someone mentioned that early in
the morning you
mindset is so important I couldn&#39;t agree
more
as something that the box is called
morning pages that I&#39;ve been doing for
about three and a half years now I have
many books for and what it is what is it
you wake up in the morning I wake up in
the morning before I reach for my phone
please don&#39;t do that when you wake up
before I start checking Facebook ins
whatever it is that&#39;s that&#39;s clouding
your mind with external narrative
check-in where am i what is going on and
I check in by writing three pages long
had I write and in writing I can yeah
when I&#39;m a kid but but with the
narrative that is that is echoing in my
mind my pain my joy my hopes my dreams
aspirations my insecurities all of it
and hearing
it&#39;s okay I&#39;m not saying you must do
this still the brace yourself I&#39;m
sharing my practice and for many people
it&#39;s different it could be taking a walk
it could be praying communication with
God
singing Thanksgiving it could be the
conversations with people that enrich
your soul they could just be a quiet
moment with yourself so your latest
check them how was yesterday did I do
what I want to screw what do I want
today there&#39;s so many ways but it is
connect that space of connection I found
myself to so as we talk about bridge
building you make Church the person in
your mind&#39;s eye she might have been a
little girl and there&#39;s so many
maybe a little boy that&#39;s wrong how can
you connect to that to which you are and
let go of all the voices that tell you
things that do not serve you about
yourself me and myself the little girl
that I was believe that she was not good
in languages and she is one and the same
with a woman that stands a bunch of you
now and and I believe and the things
that deserve me who I have and all the
things that have been I can country eats
this orange remember Winston it&#39;s been
mentioned I am because you are and you
are because we are but first of all you
are and in being in your treatment in
your full potential then you can give
them weekend together together as only
together can we go the distance we can
contribute the feature that we know it&#39;s
so important for us to assure I am
because you are
and you are
