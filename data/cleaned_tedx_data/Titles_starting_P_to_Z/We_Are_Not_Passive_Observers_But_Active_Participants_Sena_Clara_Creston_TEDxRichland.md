we are not just passive observers of our
world but active participants the light
space and materials that make up our
environment influence our thoughts and
emotions but the world is so big and we
are so small our individual actions seem
insignificant compared to the forces of
time nature and society the untouchable
beauty of a natural landscape gives the
illusion of it being a powerful force of
vengeful disregard and the crumbling
ruins of a cultural wasteland give the
illusion of the impermanence of our
actions it looks like whatever we do
today will be erased by geological
history but all we have control of is
what we do and our actions have profound
impact on the well-being of our world
I&#39;m an artist inspired by my environment
my real one not just the natural one
I feel the effects my environment has on
me and I see the effects humanity has on
the environment how do we talk about the
symbiotic relationship of codependent
allies I&#39;m compelled to make art that
highlights the power and the poetry of
the world we live in while revealing the
consequence of our actions I grew up in
New York City where the dominant life is
human life the environment was
rigorously regulated and never under
control the great outdoors was full of
danger adventure and a constant quest of
freedom I began staging photographic
tableaus of kids in the woods or in
abandoned industrial areas away from the
societal rules and expectations of
grown-ups not being bad just being wild
human animals set free in the elusive
magic of after dark I wanted my viewer
to be able to project themselves into
these liberating environments so I
presented my images as light boxes and
set them at a small dark room to create
a quiet breeding ground of fantasy
and memory but a picture is still a
picture and there remained an obvious
distance between the subject of my
photograph and the intended subject of
my piece the viewer instead of having my
viewer relates to somebody else being
emotionally influenced by an evocative
environment I wanted to create an
environment in which to provide an
experience in cities where the cacophony
of culture prevails we become
disconnected with the profound
experience of being alone in a powerful
environment what do we do when cultural
norms prove impotent do we act on
instinct or morals I built inside
outhouse to capture the feeling of
freedom and fear isolation and elation
felt while standing alone on a country
road at night the panoramic images of
desolate firm scapes are printed on
backlit transparencies and used to form
the interior walls of a small farmhouse
that can be transported back to the city
for urban dwellers the vast American
landscape is recreated in a cell size
space with walls that appear to be built
out of distance and light and while
inside outhouse stages the power of the
ingested landscape it ignores the
actions of the viewer and the reactions
of the environment to activate my viewer
and articulate my environment I animated
the garden with responses to the viewers
movements when the viewer gets within
range robotic flowers and close their
petals within their leaves shaking as if
they&#39;re nervous if the viewer continues
to approach the flowers respond by
becoming aggressive snapping their
petals and leaves open and shut
only when the viewer retreats well the
flowers relax open their leaves and
expose their petals the viewer in turn
reacts to the to the flowers they will
either retreat apologetically or embrace
confrontation with the skittish
sculptures and approach them as a piece
of art to be
and understood I&#39;m asking my viewer to
question their responsibility for their
environment are the flowers mere objects
to be enjoyed or beings with feelings to
be respected animating my sculptures
makes them seem alive and so how they
are made should make sense from within
the imaginary world from which they come
I don&#39;t just want my sculptures to look
real I don&#39;t just want them to act real
I want them to be what they are in
organic others born from the constructed
reality of consumer culture the material
matters I don&#39;t live in a world of raw
material I live in a world of stuff and
in my dystopian future the reanimated
remnants of post-industrial sentience
will be the survivors of civilization
once its primary function is lost what
else could it be animating the inanimate
brings it to life and brown paper bags
inspire the same feeling of freedom as
any bird when it takes flight for brown
paper bag birds highlighting the beauty
and the poetry of new Bikila dismissal
allows us to see a bird and think of
freedom and see garbage as a reminder of
what&#39;s lost in my dystopian future the
obsolete machine is prime material
especially one is simple and elegant as
the bicycle it&#39;s purely mechanical and
built to last the knower machine is
constructed like a carnival ride
as the viewer pedals cyclical rolls of
minimalist scenery or propelled past
mimicking the experience of freedom felt
while riding alone on a country road
through the crude animation of a broken
machine being brought to life through
movement and imagination our environment
is saturated with the manufactured
castaways people don&#39;t want or need
anymore
TVs VCRs tape decks computers printer
hard drive disk drives once valuable
home purchases are now gathering dust at
Goodwill or being discarded under the
guise of electronic recycling what is
the value of these machines it was
valuable enough for the materials to be
mined and processed engineered
fabricated shipped and sold and now it&#39;s
worthless enough for me to chop it up
and use it as an art material if they
are no longer needed to do what they
were designed to do do they still have
value I began taking these orphaned
machines apart and harvesting them for
their gears motors and electronics but
the most powerful quality they still
possess is the poetry of their complex
movements so I use these machines to
puppeteer my kinetic sculptures my
installations try and seduce my viewer
into a childlike fantasy while
illuminating their adult choices you
seek solace in a constructed environment
as you would a natural one the Machine
escape tries to harness the
contemplative feeling people get when
immersed in a dependable rhythmic
environment while alluding to the human
tendency to try and control and
ultimately destroy nature with
technology spinner dress examines the
evolution of music through the mediated
commodification of culture it&#39;s made
from woven Grateful Dead bootleg
cassette tapes and the viewer is invited
to play the nonlinear recordings by
fondling a spinning dress sculpture with
gloves made from hacked Walkman moving
to the American West I was overcome by
how open and exposed it was
environmental features come together to
create the texture of the surrounding
landscape it&#39;s the remnants of industry
that are out of place here impromptu
rural shooting pits are an oasis of
implied human activity where acres of
public land are carpeted with thousands
of spent shotgun shells their bounty
mimics the texture of the surrounding
landscape and are only out of place in
color
and material these bright totems of red
blue green pink yellow they look like
toys or candy an oculus and fun but each
one arrives with a secret explosion and
an engineered intention of bloodshed how
do I talk about our relationship with
this environment I wanted to create a
space that evoked feelings of security
and fear showcasing the overwhelming
bounty of a powerful and dangerous
material made of a mortal plastic
discarded materials linger as a reminder
to what they once were the harvested
shells look like scales or cells or the
bark of a tree I wove them together into
the samia basada an enterable biomorphic
tree creature explosion that embraces
the viewer with its outstretched arms of
reassuring beauty while telling a
history of violence and destruction the
shells can&#39;t hide what they are but
showcase their eternal brutal beauty the
America of considers the commodification
of American culture has seen through
Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave the teepees
made from materials that will be
abundantly available after the downfall
of our civilization a hundred pounds of
use bluejeans conduit safety pins and
pop tops and of course the captivating
hearth is the television a tool used to
depict imagined events rather than
provide actual experience the result is
eerily familiar and pleasantly
meditative and on the open road what
else could a vehicle be a way of
transporting us from reality to fantasy
back to reality
I built the umbrella ship with support
from artists trust and students from
Washington State&#39;s University to bring
to life the child√≠s assumption of the
way machines could work why do we accept
things for the way things are just
because it&#39;s the way they have always
been the physical realization of a
sailboat gliding across the desert
landscape beg for additional illusions
reminiscent of a childlike dream vessel
so the vehicle transitions from bed to
ship to bicycle it&#39;s propelled by a
large umbrella that can be steered to
catch the wind and walking chuck oars a
single passenger climbs into the bed
boat and is able to sail the umbrella
ship across land
the human all is the piece that I&#39;m
currently working on with the Robotics
Club at Washington State University
it&#39;s designed to question the
relationship between the human and the
other machines animals strangers our
environment how do we hear their voice
in a cold dimly blue lit space a
humanoid animalistic robot pieces back
and forth in front of the entrance to a
fiery red cave it&#39;s a century protecting
its lair when it senses an intruder it
stops turns its head and glows red
voicing its displeasure fear and
aggression the viewer is then forced to
respond to this challenge deciding
whether to heed the warnings of a being
of unknown power and back off or embrace
the human alas a piece of art to be
examined and understood upon inspection
familiar materials reveal a second
ambiguous relationship the human l and
cave are made from discarded plastic
water bottles and shopping bags the
bringer of life and the polluter of land
we made this angry environment where we
are not welcome our actions have
profound impact on the world around us
but often go unnoticed for better or for
worse how do we feel the effect of our
actions how do we take responsibility
for what we do in a way that inspires
understanding and change I build
responsive environments that through
action and reaction material and
illusion fantasy and reality ask the
viewer to question their actions in the
past present and future thank you
you
