there were 300 people in my year group
at secondary school and the only place
that we could fit to sit exams was in
our vast assembly hall students would
line up in rows all along the floor of
the hall and along the raised stage area
and at the front of the stage area were
two huge forward-facing clocks they were
big enough for all of the students to be
able to see so there are approximately
295 students sat down at their desks
anxiously awaiting the start of their
maths exam
my name is cord I walk up the stairs
poach my seat and I realize I&#39;m stuck
there&#39;s not enough room between the back
of the clock and the back of my chair
for me to be able to fit so at this
point I have two options option number
one forego a brief moment of
embarrassment ask a member of staff to
rearrange some furniture so that I can
sit down or number two
breathe in and hope for the best it
transpires however that no amount of
breathing in and hoping for the best is
going to let me fit between the chair
and the clock the clock falls to the
floor narrowly avoiding a front desk of
students who were probably expecting a
nasty surprise that day but more in the
form of a challenging algebra question
than furniture hurdling towards their
face my name is Rachel Vogler I&#39;m a 21
year old undergraduate student here at
Central and my body has never fit so at
the crux of this story lies a sentiment
that&#39;s actually deeply troubling namely
we&#39;ve managed to construct a consensus
that says women&#39;s bodies need to be a
certain size in order to fit in to
public space when they don&#39;t fit
we&#39;ve stigmatized them we&#39;ve stigmatized
fatness
we&#39;ve labeled it unworthy lazy grotesque
we&#39;ve boxed it up and we&#39;ve pushed it
far away from our national conscience no
actually most of us are complicit in a
culture that grates women for taking up
space sounds harsh bear with me for as
long as I can remember I have taken up a
lot of space in fact I&#39;m pretty sure the
only time I was an acceptable size was
near my exit from the womb and since
I&#39;ve paid space way greater than that of
my perceived deserving I&#39;ve watched my
body grow and my skin stretch at a rate
I can&#39;t control and I&#39;ve got marks all
over my hips and my breasts to prove it
and as my body grew so diminished my
confidence and in some darker times I
made one truly loyal companion Shane and
I were best friends really we did
everything together we particularly
enjoyed birthday parties barbecues
crowded spaces shame and I tried a path
that wasn&#39;t necessarily unique actually
it&#39;s a path that a growing number of
young women are treading it&#39;s the one
that goes from the eating disorder
clinic to the doctor surgery to the
fridge and back again time and time over
and it wasn&#39;t that shame and I didn&#39;t
know our place we did know our place it
wasn&#39;t in public you see as long as
shame and I could be pitied we were
doing fad right we were the reason you
workout fat fat and shameful fat and
unhappy this is bad fat and a few years
down the line when Shane and I made a
change we were doing it right then to
see instead of exclusively being fat and
unhappy we became the fat woman
desperately trying not to be fat anymore
now this is not fat unhappy
this is the fat woman in a transition
state trying to get from before to after
and this is good fat
now people absolutely love good fat
seriously when Shane and I started going
to the gym twice a day every day when
Shane and I started obsessively
restricting our eating people praised us
applauded us it remains true then and it
is true now that being the fat woman
trying not to be fat anymore is one of
the most respectable ventures that you
combine to so flash-forward and as so
many people do by plateaued and as
according to an article in The New York
Times 95% of people who diet do I put on
all the weight I had lost and more and
more and more and on the morning of my
21st birthday there supposedly awaited
dawning of new womanhood I wake up in
the morning and I realize I&#39;m still fat
and so for the first time in my life I
choose the radical I decide to commit to
investing time and energy into radically
shifting my perception of myself and of
my body and in doing so I buy into some
kind of underground movement called
happy fat happy fat is understandably a
state that a lot of people find
confusing so let us understand why we&#39;re
used generally to being able to sort the
fat people that we encounter into two
distinct categories they are good fat
and bad fat now I&#39;ve mentioned them both
earlier but let&#39;s look at them in a
little bit more detail now bad fat means
pity in order to thrive bad fat is a
drain on the National Health Service a
drain on the state bad fat can probably
be found sat on the sofa smoking a
cigarette weight
for the next benefit pack to roll around
or maybe crying in front of the fridge
bad fats is probably your worst
nightmare
and then there&#39;s good fat good fat is
visibly engaged in attempts not to be
fat anymore
now these attempts are probably costly
and they are probably failing good fat
does things like not order dessert in a
restaurant and as such she is
commendable respectable fat now it
doesn&#39;t actually matter what good fat
does at home right because as long as
she is committed to the public
suppression of habit it-- she is easier
to perceive as a valuable member of
society happy fat then is a rejection of
stigmatized fat and it&#39;s not an end game
as much as it is a state in fact happy
fat is a state of being that incurs once
I admit to myself I have been fat I am
fat I will be fat and there&#39;s very
little that I&#39;m doing about it also a
decision that a lot of people find
confusing now the past 18 months for me
can be marked by a series of
observations that I&#39;ve made about how I
figure myself into the world as a fat
woman and how the world sees me and I&#39;d
like to share with you three of those
main observations followed by three
small steps that I took to try and honor
my body in the best way possible
so observation number one the space now
I&#39;d like you to do something for me for
a second if that&#39;s okay think about your
past week think about some of the times
that you might have spent walking down
the street now it&#39;s likely that you were
involved in a scenario that plays out a
little like this you&#39;re walking down the
street in one direction minding your own
business and in the distance you see
someone else probably a man
sorry it&#39;s true walking towards you and
as they come closer it becomes
increasingly obvious that this person
has zero intention of moving out the way
and that the inevitable point of meeting
what do you do you probably shift to the
side you probably look at the floor
maybe you say sorry and as you continue
your journey maybe that happens to you a
second time a third time maybe when
you&#39;re on the tube on the way in this
morning you folded your arms or you
crossed your legs or you pushed up
against the glass you said sorry you
excuse yourself out of existence in
order to accommodate somebody else now
the street scenario and the tube
scenario are two of the clearest ways
that we can understand that the taking
up of space is disproportionate it&#39;s
also not merely visual right it&#39;s
gendered and it&#39;s political and actually
both the tube scenario and the street
scenario are some of the most frequent
manifestations of the rhetoric that
women are fed from all angles all their
lives the rhetoric that says you must
squeeze and squish and fold and say
sorry and be polite whilst doing so and
so then when I or you or we excuse
ourselves out of space with a story or
an excuse me or in is there room for me
and my big bum there every time we do
that we in some small way consent to the
notion that we deserve less space that
we are in some way worthy of
preemptively being a thought of that way
and of course we know that&#39;s not true
and so step one seemed more logical step
one is embracing a mentality that lets
me exist without apology and basically I
wanted to see what it would be like to
pretend that this whole space debacle
wasn&#39;t a norm so I walked down the
street a couple of times and didn&#39;t move
out the way when some someone was coming
towards me causes confusion and also
there&#39;s quite a lot of me to accommodate
so that makes for a truly fascinating
visual
and sure this isn&#39;t revolutionary but
what small steps like these start to do
is account for the fact that there are
women who refuse to apologize for
themselves for their bodies and for the
space they take up and honestly this is
just scratching the surface of the space
conversation so observation - I want to
tackle something small and that is
dieting right so it seems that most of
the Western world is fixated on ensuring
that women buy into this rhetoric we
talked about before but perpetuated in
the most insidious way possible and diet
culture is so insidious that we don&#39;t
even have to look for it before it finds
us it&#39;s everywhere in television
advertising campaigns you know that Diet
Coke one with the puppet ladies in the
fridge it&#39;s in diet pill packaging it&#39;s
in magazines and on Billboard&#39;s and what
does diet culture do it tells us that we
can have a happier life for twenty
pounds and two mil replacement shakes a
day diet culture literally traps us into
paying for a life in which happiness is
directly correlated to the smallest
amount of body mass that exists in
physical space and it&#39;s a culture by the
way that according to an article sent
out by Common Sense Media absorbs 80% of
ten-year-old girls and so step two
seemed more tricky but maybe resistance
to diet culture partly manifests in the
unapologetic loving of food so for me it
meant that I would try to relinquish the
shame that consumed me every time I made
the decision to consume in public life&#39;s
good now can eat my sandwich on the tube
I can order dessert
in a restaurant without having to
pretend that it hadn&#39;t previously
crossed my mind no what could laughs no
sideways glances just dessert
so step two is essentially about
learning to embrace appetite after only
knowing to publicly suppress it for so
long
so if observation 3 I&#39;ll talk briefly
about fad fashion now one of the things
that I&#39;d like to say about that fashion
is that it&#39;s remarkably different to the
societal perception of fashion for fat
women the golden rule of which is you
must dress as though you aren&#39;t fat
anymore
and as such a lot of plus-size fashion
tips are founded on the premise that the
only thing that you should want to do
with a fat body is conceal it now I&#39;ve
cried in enough changing rooms to know
that there are a few items of clothing
in this world worth doubting yourself
worth for and the ones that are I can&#39;t
afford anyway so we are currently
operating in a context that renders full
and unashamed self-love as radical and I
say great maybe at least right now we
need it to be so that the energy that we
are putting into creating this shift can
be noticed now the shift that I&#39;m
talking about isn&#39;t just one of
perception it&#39;s one of ownership - it&#39;s
the public and personal reclamation of
the right to love and honor your body
for ourselves and for generations of
young women for whom loving and knowing
themselves can be a matter of life and
death what does the other side of the
shift look like it looks like the full
embrace of diverse bodied women it looks
like greater visibility
it looks like the rapid end to using
photos of fat women as inspiration and
it sounds distinctly like less apologies
so there are lots of things that the fat
girl doesn&#39;t get told and so from the
fat girl to a room of diverse bodied
people I would like you to know this it
might be true that we can&#39;t change the
traits that people attach to our bodies
but what we can change is the investment
of our emotional resources from fear and
hatred and self-loathing to full deep
radical self-love and if however
bizarrely self-love is radical the shift
is to thank you
[Applause]
