so in 2004 the world as we know it
changed a 24 year old man named Mark
Zuckerberg launched a website called
Facebook to make this world a more
connected and inclusive place it was
beautiful
keeping in touch had never been easier
and you could keep in be connected to
your friends and family and be a part of
their lives one upload at a time as time
went by it evolved hashtags photo
uploads wall I don&#39;t even know what the
countless number of features that
evolved to in 2010 there was another
breakthrough called Instagram photo
sharing had been revolutionized it was
now even easier to showcase your life
through photos and videos for you guys
obviously know about this it&#39;s like
teaching physics to Einstein but it&#39;s
not pointless banter there&#39;s a reason
for me speaking about this and that is
that while you may be available why you
may be aware of all of this technology
and how it&#39;s been destructive in nature
you may not necessarily realize that
with it comes a virtual world one that
is very different from everyday life let
me start from the beginning of my story
I launched humans a bombe on social
media on Jan 28 2014 I was so naive and
unprofessional back then there&#39;s a the
debate first humans a bombe logo was
created on Microsoft Word and my cover
photo was created on collage maker I was
so lazy that I didn&#39;t even bother
removing that collage maker at the
bottom so that&#39;s still up there but
anyways I launched it and I still
remember the feeling of watching the
likes grew within the first two hours we
had a thousand likes and within the
first week we had 10,000 I definitely
felt like I was on to something
but I&#39;m human the bombe grew the numbers
grew we&#39;re at 900,000 organic followers
right now and it bugs me that we&#39;re
still not at a million we reach about
five million people a week with
crowdfunded over two crores in the past
two years for various causes we&#39;ve been
featured in every major publication in
the country and a few globally and we&#39;re
also on route to releasing our first set
of films
it all sounds perfect but it really
isn&#39;t and never been that&#39;s the thing
what social media brings with it is this
idea of a perfect picture and a perfect
life before this talk I kind of went
through my own Instagram and I saw this
beautiful montage of experiences there
were talks like these publications in
Forbes Asia beautiful travels you can
see everything that was the high point
of my life it all looked so perfect and
well fit but as I was writing this talk
it actually made me feel really
deceiving and really shallow because
that&#39;s not how life always is and that&#39;s
not what life is about
the thing about the social media bubble
as I like to call it is that you scroll
through Instagram you follow this model
or that blogger or just your friends and
you go through life believing that
everybody is perpetually happy and
everybody is perpetually having these
victorious moments in life while you are
living a pretty average life believe me
I get it my obsession with Gigi Hadid is
almost unhealthy and I get it but that&#39;s
the sad truth about it and I feel that
this is only because everybody is so
obsessive about sharing their victories
and sharing their high points and not
how they actually got there which is
pretty much everybody per every person&#39;s
track trajectory it&#39;s failure so spoken
a couple of times about
what I&#39;ve learned from humans Bombay
what it&#39;s taught me and the success of
it but today I thought I&#39;d do something
different and speak about how I failed
which I did over and over again on my
journey here so back to college I was a
Business Economics double major in the
University of Nottingham and I&#39;d been a
straight-a student all my life and for
the first time in university I failed I
failed to economics modules and it was
terrible I remember feeling like I&#39;d
completely lost what I was what I used
to be but while this was going on in my
life the photo I was sharing was of this
beautiful lake on my campus and
Nottingham completely different from
what I was actually going through that&#39;s
how deceptive it can be when I came back
after my undergrad I actually decided to
take a sabbatical of six months which
not a lot of people do in hindsight it
was a great decision because it allowed
me the time to kind of explore myself
and see what I want to do in life but
back then I dealt with a deep anxiety
all of my friends who I was studying
with in college were either getting a
masters and MBA or were at high paying
jobs with six-figure salaries and I was
at home reading exploring kind of
rewriting but not really knowing what I
wanted to do in life and that anxiety
was very very much evident in my
everyday life but not once was that
shown in my perfect Instagram feed I
then it was joined this time that I
actually launched my first company which
not a lot of people know about it was
called NOC and I don&#39;t even remember
what the name means anymore but it was
something fancy and the basic idea was
at the age of 21 with my tea spoon worth
of expiry
I wanted to have positive thinking and
affirmation classes for people all over
Bombay it works for me in the sense that
it balanced me out and kind of prepared
me for like a more aligned future but as
a startup it failed and not a lot of
people even know that I created
something like this before humans a
Bombay but I did as it filled there was
more anxiety my parents were worried I
was going through this huge
contemplation phase should I just get a
job for the sake of it even though I
don&#39;t really know what I want to do even
though I don&#39;t really know what I love
doing or what I&#39;m passionate about but I
guess the positively positivity classes
paid off for somebody and that is just
me
because completely randomly and out of
the blue I stumbled upon the idea of
humans of Bombay and I started it and it
clicked that period was a high of its
own to start something new and exciting
to get features in a publication to be
known was amazing and it was an
experience that I&#39;ll always hold really
close to my heart but as I was happily
boasting about it what most people don&#39;t
know is that it took an immense
sacrifice to get that following for the
first three years humans of Bombay
didn&#39;t make any income it was completely
bootstrapped and self run and I was
pretty much not making any money while
most people were gushing about this new
blog on the block I was still
financially dependent and that basically
sucked
can you imagine feeling on top of the
world and getting an article in Forbes
Asia but the next minute you were
getting pocket money from your parents
it was a grounding and it was I don&#39;t
know a feeling of not knowing I
questioned myself a lot during this
period where was this going what was I
set out to achieve and would it even
mean something in the future I guess I
went with the flow of things and just
allowed it to be for a while but as time
progressed of course human zabumba
monetized
but we also came out with a book and if
any of you here are planning on becoming
writers I&#39;ll give you a very succinct
disclaimer that there isn&#39;t any money
there but I became an author at the age
of 24 and I start to feel confident I
began to feel like okay maybe I had made
some sort of a mark in the world and I
was worth something or I had some value
to me but my bubble burst very quickly
and it was an unfortunate tryst with
Bollywood don&#39;t worry I didn&#39;t try to
become an actress or anything I just
tried to interview one and this is
actually one of the incidents that
really shaped how I saw myself so back I
think it was a year ago movie called
dear zindagi was releasing and somebody
from the red chillies team actually
approached me to interview
alia Bhatt and I was super excited I was
like wow they thought of humans are
Bombay they thought of me
I must be doing something right and of
course I want to do it because I wanted
to feature the human side to somebody
who was so well known and who was in the
public eye all the time I went for the
interview I was super excited I reached
15 minutes before time you know just
being professional
had all my questions my photographer was
with me it was like a whole deal and I
reached there and I was basically made
to wait in this really tiny corridor and
I figured I was like okay you know there
it&#39;s human there are times I&#39;m
there&#39;s times when everybody&#39;s late it&#39;s
fine but I was made to basically
endlessly wait and every time I asked
when the interview could happen or would
happen I was told 15 more minutes just
15 more minutes and I ended up waiting
for two hours and 45 minutes just doing
nothing and that&#39;s the time I actually
decided you know what this is not
working out like I don&#39;t feel like I
should Amy see wait because the last
time I checked again they were like 15
more minutes so I went to the person who
I was in touch with she was a red
Chili&#39;s manager and I said you know I
have another commitment I&#39;m going to
leave and she said she just shrugged her
shoulders and said okay that&#39;s fine but
just to let you know it&#39;s normal to wait
for a superstar for four or five hours
and that&#39;s something that really hit me
because I believe that you know there&#39;s
value to offer from everybody but I left
that place feeling dejected and really
small and I started thinking about you
know this whole process of this whole
bubble that we live in where you know
we&#39;re following these celebrities on
Instagram were following them on social
media and we think it&#39;s a great life but
you don&#39;t know what goes on behind the
scenes because it&#39;s spoken about so
seldom or so not very often I left that
place feeling like you know I don&#39;t know
what I did wrong did I say something did
I do something so I just have waited it
out but in hindsight I feel like I did
the right thing the funniest and the
best part about this whole thing is that
alia Bhatt probably didn&#39;t even know I
was there but I was and she created an
experience in my life
that she taught me a pretty decent
lesson that I feel has helped me along
the way so I was supremely humiliated
and embarrassed of this incident and
decided to bury it I was like I&#39;m not
going to talk about it
I&#39;m just gonna let it be and I&#39;m gonna
focus on my work and prove a point by
doing better work and by creating a name
for myself but I feel like that
experience was necessary for my for me
and for my life only because it shaped
how I saw myself and I realized that if
I were to value myself I could never let
that happen to me again and I haven&#39;t
never again have I waited aimlessly for
somebody or something and put myself
down and I think that that was an
important lesson for me to learn it also
made me more aware of other people&#39;s
time so I actually plan my meetings and
my schedule in such a way that I&#39;m never
late and I think that&#39;s a great habit to
have all my failures actually have had a
deep impact on me and I&#39;ve taught me
really valuable lessons my first start
up feeling just taught me to have faith
and believe in me and to believe in the
process and not overthink too much not
making money initially made me value it
a lot more when I did make it and NSE
waiting for celebrity made me realize my
self worth and self value which I feel
is really important to have and he&#39;s
only some of my failures I&#39;ve literally
had so many downs that I can&#39;t even
calculate it and I can&#39;t even express it
and I&#39;ve had my share of Downers I&#39;ve
been I&#39;ve had I&#39;ve been through a
heartbreak I&#39;ve been unable to function
I&#39;ve been a complete mess I&#39;ve had
people speak not very favorably about me
I&#39;ve been upset to the point where I&#39;ve
never wanted I didn&#39;t want to get out of
bed on a particular day I&#39;ve met all
kinds of people but I&#39;ve lost old
friends as well and I feel like the
whole experience of it has just been an
up-and-down I&#39;ve had my share of
questioning what&#39;s wrong with me and I
did my stubborn best to hide it from the
way I put through myself
on social media and that&#39;s only because
it didn&#39;t match the life I was trying to
portray was mine now that doesn&#39;t mean
that the next time you&#39;re going through
a heartbreak you take to Facebook and
write an open letter to an ex it doesn&#39;t
mean that it just means that you know
that everybody does have a Down
everybody struggles and everybody fails
at some point in their life but it&#39;s
only for high and low and if you&#39;re up
and down that you know that you&#39;re
actively you have a heart that&#39;s beating
and that your life today I&#39;m sure
because of accumulation of my failures
and I&#39;m very very proud to say that I&#39;m
here because I chose to embrace it and
not give up I&#39;m here because I had faith
in the only person who I needed to have
faith and through this whole journey and
that was me
I failed therefore I am and that is the
most real most honest and most reliable
truth of my life thank you
[Applause]
