do you know what Thomas message said it
said and I got the job and trust me that
was not part of the initial plan what
about you what is your plan and if you
have one do you ever wonder if it&#39;s the
right one if you&#39;re on the right path
for it if you&#39;ve made the right choices
and if you&#39;ll be able to make the right
choices your whole life who who ever one
does that no one know where we&#39;re going
at the beginning of your life maybe for
some of you you already know more
advanced in your careers and yet for
everyone this question brings up two
reactions
the first one is excitement I have a
plan it&#39;s so cool I&#39;m so excited it&#39;s
here I can see it it&#39;s a straight line
it&#39;s right here it&#39;s calling me it&#39;s
shining at night I&#39;ll make it and then
there&#39;s the other reaction right there
is a kind of a plan it&#39;s kind of over
here that&#39;s blurry that&#39;s scary
I&#39;m not sure I can make it I&#39;m not sure
I&#39;ll stay on the path I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s
for me and I think all of us experience
this and what&#39;s interesting with it is
that not only we feel like those
questions can either make a smooth fold
or paralyze us but the people around us
do a great deal for it as well right
those people who love us and care for us
and think that the best thing for us
would be to go from point A to point B
to use a very nice simple straight line
this is me
about 25 years ago we&#39;ll talk about it
later
I was very aesthetic but most
importantly I knew I wanted to be a
psychologist so I was going to be simple
right the plan was made the path was
easy my parents thought that go to
university study psychology or languages
anything right so that I&#39;d be doing
something but I was 18 and it wasn&#39;t
that clear I didn&#39;t know what I wanted
to do I didn&#39;t know how I would get
there
I just knew I wanted to be a
psychologist so I decided up just take
one little year off and take time to
think very unwise very unsafe said most
people around me but I did it if I went
to America the country where the sky is
the limit
I was no pair for a year and I loved it
and these kind of experiences are great
because you learn so many things you
discover new cultures you discover new
people and first of all yourself you
discover the new person you are you
didn&#39;t know you were as the first time I
had chances to discover the beauty of
getting lost and not just because it
took me a very long time to be able to
get back to the family house when I
first arrived there but also because I
was off the path and I could just be
myself and be free the path was home
waiting for me had plenty of time to get
back to it
I lived this incredible year enjoying
being a childcare provider and
developing professional skills as I
spend quite a lot of time helping the
parents were getting divorced developed
great listening skills patience
understanding that was an interesting
experience but the year came to an end
and it was time to get back on my path
life in America was not really
imaginable home was waiting for me
if I went I arrived back home and felt
really lonely lost still and I was
really hard to fit in again but I was
lucky my parents had signed me up to
attend law university so that at least I
would be doing something right and I was
even luckier in that I passed the first
year without any difficulties and
realized by the month of October that if
I stayed any longer the second year I
would probably hang myself back to
loneliness back to quite I could say
isolation this feeling of not fitting in
and a path that was really really blurry
but I was lucky I was offered by mouths
family to come back to America to live
with them again
to help them with the children what they
would help me go to school great
opportunity right I seized it it&#39;s okay
the path could wait I would get back to
France I would find my way around it
would be okay I seized it and loved it
nanni by day international students by
night I discovered a new world again I
was living the American dream
the American dream of the French girl in
Denver and I met mentors there and those
mentors will make teachers and they
showed us that we could trust them that
it would be here for us that they were
present that they would challenge us but
I did trusted us I was able to study
communication psychology and social
sciences discover new worlds new
horizons loved every single step of it
this is me
1997 first inter college public speaking
contest I got third place
it&#39;s very proud of myself I moved to
Dallas after that
we&#39;re probably graduated in
communication psychology and social
sciences the world was mine I had it all
life love diplomas maybe there was a
path for me in America something was
missing though start spreading the news
[Music]
I&#39;m coming today I&#39;m gonna be a part of
it
New York New York had to make it into
the real big world right so I went to
New York in New York I add another
incredible experience
I was working seven days a week and
loved every single day of it I was
working as a sales representative for a
French cosmetic company to pay the bills
and I was also working as a
communication assistant for the High
Commissioner for Refugees at unite at
the United Nations to follow my heart I
think the path was getting quite clear
the red carpet was opening up in front
of me
I could see it I could touch it I could
feel it incredible years so my path was
not in France after all that was in
America I had it all and then two towers
collapsed in the center of Manhattan and
life changed for a lot of people for me
it meant that it was impossible to get a
new visa to stay in America but I was
positive I&#39;d received a document that
said that I&#39;d been selected to get the
green card through the lottery so I went
home very very trusting that I would be
back in no time
went back home sound good I wasn&#39;t gonna
stay very long my path was in America my
life was in America and then my
boyfriend was waiting for me in America
I met someone else
and I never received any document from
the Immigration Services it took a
little while for me to be able to pick
up a pen again and draw a new line and a
new plan the line had disappeared but
someone said when the plan doesn&#39;t work
change the plan never change to go I
wanted to be a psychologist
I even had experience now in social work
with refugees I was going to make it
anywhere if you want to be a
psychologist you need to start over
but have a four-year diploma in
communication and psychology yes but in
the house it is not recognized the line
didn&#39;t disappear there as the whole
ground that vanished do you know the
feeling you&#39;ve made so much efforts
you&#39;ve put all you had into one plan one
goal you&#39;ve worked for it you&#39;ve seen it
I was so near and it disappears c&#39;est la
vie
I was lucky though looking for school
where I could get a degree or maybe find
value for my past experiences I
discovered the safe and my past
experiences were valued there I was back
on track one year as an international
student international student by day
English teacher by night I had an
incredible experience once again I won&#39;t
say too much more about that because
some of you don&#39;t know yet what its
gonna be like well talk about it at the
end of the year and it was an incredible
experience I loved every day
of it every city of it every teacher all
right every one of my colleagues in my
promotion but at the end of the year I
realized I could not afford to go to
Brussels or one of the other cities for
to work for one of the institutions and
get that work experiencia - supposed to
get through and paid internships so I
decided to just start teaching and I
became a language teacher really enjoyed
it I hope people get out of their
comfort zone develop themselves
dare to try new things but something was
missing
however one day one of my students said
thanks to you I&#39;m changing my life is
changing I&#39;m daring to do things I would
never have done before thank you and I
realized I was back on the path this was
my path after all and it was a good one
eight years ago I decided to create my
own company and I became a coach in
communication and business and I&#39;m sure
you imagine it was an easy choice to
make right you weigh the opportunities
against the threats you rationally think
it&#39;s ok I can make it there is a need
I&#39;ll just jump in well it&#39;s not exactly
how it happened but I decided to go for
the jump I closed my eyes real tight
mastered all the courage I could find
and jumped in life of the number of an
entrepreneur is a mix of joys and tears
happiness and
successes and failures but I went for it
and I have absolutely no regret today
just like Thomas Thomas who had worked
his whole life to be a hospital director
and decided one day to take a huge term
and apply for position that he should
never have gotten counselor at the
highest level for the French government
but he did it so if you are thinking
that you&#39;re not sure about your plan if
you&#39;re wondering if you&#39;re on the right
track if you&#39;re afraid of making
mistakes I want you to stop thinking
immediately because as Nicola Bouvier
said on the road once one gets lost this
is when the real journey begins because
plans can yield to surprises so don&#39;t be
afraid don&#39;t be afraid to make mistakes
don&#39;t be afraid to take tock turns
don&#39;t be afraid of sharp cuts let&#39;s turn
them into short cuts
even though reality can be like that
sometimes there are things we can do to
make those transitions more empowering
and the first thing I would like to do
is for you to take out your phones
please or raise up your phones if
they&#39;re already in your hands and go to
Facebook
once on Facebook I would like you to
type the force of transitions and
request to become a member of this group
that I&#39;ve created for all of us because
the problem is not transitions
transitions are the norms transitions
are what we&#39;re going to experience every
other day the problem is the isolation
we put ourselves in when going through
transitions and I think in the future
there&#39;s a way we can change that and the
solution is through connection let&#39;s
stay connected and let&#39;s make sure we
help each other get empowered through
every single one of their transitions
because today I share with you some of
my transitions and now I would like to
hear your transitions thank you
you
