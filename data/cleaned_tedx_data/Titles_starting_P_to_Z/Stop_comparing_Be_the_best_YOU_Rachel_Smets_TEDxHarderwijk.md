well imagine you&#39;re sitting in a cafe
downtown and you order your favorite
coffee and while you wait you sit around
and observe the people around you the
waitress comes and brings your coffee
and after a bit of a small talk you find
out she&#39;s the owner of that cafe and she
smiles and walks away and serves other
people and you look at her and you sit
back and you think hmm I wish I had that
too I wish I had my own business I wish
I was that happy I wish I had that much
freedom I wish I wish
well that waitress many years ago was me
people told me how lucky I was to have
my own business to be that happy and to
have that much freedom lucky cleaning up
every night working seven days a week
working weekends when everyone else was
partying a relaxing days I had to smile
on the outside and feel like shit on the
inside lucky so it seemed but that&#39;s
when I learned comparing yourself
makes no sense those people were
comparing themselves to my seemingly
perfect life resulting in feeling bad
and putting themselves down and they
didn&#39;t even know half the truth those
years taught me how comparing ourselves
to others can make us feel miserable but
I learned how to turn it around and feel
good instead so that&#39;s what I&#39;m here to
share with you today most comparison is
not fair we often forget that achieving
goals takes hard work let&#39;s say you want
to become really fit or healthy takes a
lot of workouts and specific lifestyle I
have news for you David Beckham he
wasn&#39;t born this way near was Beyonce no
they
to put India for to watching their diet
spending countless hours at the gym like
running my cafe it has nice moments yeah
but I remember vividly the smell of beer
every morning I had to clean up the
sticky tables and broken glasses make
famous authors for example before they
even become famous they spent years
writing and publishing books I write
books too and when my friends are going
out and telling me oh come with us relax
Rachel I&#39;m at home typing brainstorming
creating the reality is a book does not
write itself
so if you want all the positive and the
fame you should also want a hard work
that goes with it taking to account the
good and the bad otherwise comparing is
not fair but he has the best career and
I&#39;m an idiot
she has an amazing body but I&#39;m so weak
what are we doing here we compare the
outside with our inside I mean we
compare others outside appearances money
clothes with our inside characteristics
oh well you won&#39;t get bored you will
always find someone who has something
you wish you had as a trainer I see a
lot of people compare themselves to
others I see it all the time all the
time so when I asked him ok so tell me
about that person you compared yourself
to that person is an exact copy of you
it must be because you can only compare
similar things right
you don&#39;t compare apples and oranges no
they&#39;re too different but even if you
would have an exact genetic twin you
would still grow up with different
activities different experiences
different ideas and thoughts your
personalities wouldn&#39;t be the same your
likes and dislikes wouldn&#39;t be
same so why would your accomplishments
be the same they can be impossible
copying others means you live in their
shadow you follow them so here&#39;s a
question for you
you want to be a follower the rest of
your life does that make you feel good
does that make you happy
they say comparison is the thief of joy
and I truly believe that as a trainer in
cultural diversity and integration I
help people to understand their
surroundings and build their confidence
to achieve their goals and dreams and
become the person they want to be and
what I so often hear are these words I
want to cure you&#39;re like him I want a
body like her I want a house like them
usually followed by a big dropping their
shoulders sad looking eyes dropping
their head looking discouraged and this
motivated so ready to give up why are we
comparing why often comparison comes
from a counsel lack a lack of confidence
a lack of love a lack of self-esteem we
focus on all the things that we want we
focus on all the things that we don&#39;t
have and that creates a gap between the
ideal situation and where we are now the
bigger the gap the worse we feel I can
imagine people listening to me now we&#39;re
watching me and thinking ah I wish I was
standing there
I wish I had the guts to stand on a
stage like that and and talk to and
spread a message to an amazing audience
like this well it&#39;s really simple if
you&#39;re not willing to take steps take
actions to beat your anxiety spend
countless hours researching creating
writing content like I did chances are
very slim
that you will ever see what I&#39;m seeing
now and that you will ever feel what I&#39;m
feeling now I mean look where I&#39;m
standing
comparing ourselves makes no sense but
we all comparing ourselves to others
and if you say you don&#39;t you&#39;re a liar I
mean have you ever driven into a
neighborhood with these gorgeous big
houses thinking how nice it would be to
live here but my place is the size of
der garage I sure have it&#39;s really
normal to compare yourself in fact it&#39;s
human nature where is it coming from
well we learn it in school as kids you
get your grades back what&#39;s the first
thing you do oh how much do you have and
how much do you have and how much do you
have at home our parents compared us to
our siblings can&#39;t you just listen like
your brother does do your homework just
like him how about now scrolling through
Facebook looking at dream holidays
seemingly perfect relationships amazing
fit bodies and fabulous achievements can
you honestly do that without comparing
yourself at all social media is a way to
connect us with each other instead it
often becomes a way of disconnecting
from reality the more likes we have the
better we feel let&#39;s get real here
people everyone&#39;s life is equally fucked
up every human being has bad days but we
hide our mess and we show our best we
are fooled to believe other people&#39;s
life is better than ours
we are fool to believe the grass is
greener on the other side real life is
real life for everyone so enough reasons
to feel bad let&#39;s talk about the good I
have great news for you you don&#39;t have
to feel bad you don&#39;t have to quit your
dreams on the contrary it&#39;s important to
pursue your goals and dreams you don&#39;t
even have to close
Facebook account so what can you do well
I will tell you and it&#39;s only two words
so I see some of you have pen and paper
you may want to write it down but really
it&#39;s only two words so you may remember
them the two words are stop it stop it
stop comparing yourself to others okay
how well first of all catch yourself be
aware of it and then look at yourself
really look at yourself hold up a mirror
it&#39;s called self reflection and that is
your ticket back to reality look at all
the things that you have instead of all
the things that you won&#39;t I know it
sounds easy too easy right let me tell
you I know it&#39;s not let me take you back
a few years ago I was about 37 and
obsessed by having kids of my own
everywhere around me us our families
with kids looking at my facebook friends
pictures of their kids celebrating
birthdays gathering around the Christmas
tree and there I was single no kids no
one to celebrate with no other birthdays
Christmas I don&#39;t even bother putting up
a tree until one day I was talking to my
very best friend and I said to him
you&#39;re so lucky you have it all you have
family three kids and I don&#39;t have that
he looked at me straight in the eyes and
he said the Rachel you have so many
things that I wish I had you traveled
the world
you lived in all these different
countries you experienced and learned so
much and Here I am stuck in the same
town forever driving my kids to school
doing their homework every night
preparing lunch boxes every day that was
a moment he opened my eyes
he made me aware of what I had that day
that moment I realized I had to start
telling my own story and I did and so
can you just never compare your story
with someone else&#39;s story don&#39;t compare
your chapter one with someone else&#39;s
chapter 40 tell your own story Coco
Chanel once said beauty begins the
moment you decide to be yourself and I
say to you
Beauty begins the moment you start
telling your own story and for that be
inspired be inspired look at others
listen to others talk to others and from
that reality start growing and learning
now some people may think yeah but you
can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks forget
that many studies have shown that you
can learn as an older people in fact our
brain keeps making new cells no matter
what age so you can learn and grow as
long as you make the decision I made the
decision too many years I was looking at
other speakers trainers other people
giving seminars and webinars I wanted to
do that too
so I began following them I went to
speaking events
I followed seminars webinars I talked to
trainers and speakers all around the
world I asked them tons of questions how
did you get there
what&#39;s your advice what steps did you
take at the same time I grew my network
I build a website
I read hundreds of books I started
writing chapter after chapter step by
step easy in throw away because knowing
what I want not getting it fast enough
for someone with my micro amount of
patience trust me it&#39;s really hard but I
knew if others can do it so can i and so
can you just tell your own story someone
said to me try till you die keep trying
so I figured in the end you have a
choice you can do two things or you sit
back relax look at others seemingly
doing better feel really bad about it
give up all your dreams and goals
because really all you can think is I
can&#39;t or you can look around you find
others who do what you want to do get
inspired and create ideas of your own
learn grow develop yourself and learn
from those people let&#39;s say you want to
become a great cook spend time with a
chef in the restaurant you want a new
job go and talk to someone who has that
job you want to improve your tennis game
play with someone better than you learn
from all these people step out of your
shell
securities and take advantage of all
those people around you learn as much as
you can so imagine you are 95 years old
reaching the end whose life will you
look back upon yours or someone else&#39;s
will you have spent your life comparing
yourself to others or did you decide to
live your own my message for you today
is this stop comparing yourself to
others look at yourself look and realize
all the things that you have all the
things that you know and can look at
others to be inspired learn from them
find out how they can make you grow and
my final question to you is what is your
story and when is your moment your
moment to be the best you
you
