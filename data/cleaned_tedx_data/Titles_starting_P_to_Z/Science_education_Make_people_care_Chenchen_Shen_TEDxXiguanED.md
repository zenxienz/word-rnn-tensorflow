after my seventh year in college I spent
most of the time remembering facts from
teachers or textbooks
I was always targeting good exam scores
what was in the text box and what was
asked on the exams nothing was more
important some scientific topics
captured my imagination but I had no
idea how sized knowledge mattered in my
real life when I was studying abroad I
encountered a laboratory where new
knowledge was created and was yet to be
in a textbook and hate me that all
science knowledge in textbooks is from
scientists who helped study the real
world my research is on one kind of
zooplankton flageolet they are so small
that it can be only observed under a
microscope usually flagellate eat
bacteria but this one is very special
they eat phytoplankton if you want to
observe how the flageolet eat their food
you have to count it with thousands of
them it took me almost one year to be
able to cultivate enough flageolet to be
honest I filled many times I had no idea
how to take care of them as the state
ate they are very small and as much as I
talk to them I could never know what
they were thinking but I was amazed to
observe them to observe the tiny
creature opens mouth and swallowed his
food
with its whole body this video was taken
by my senior from the same laboratory
you can see this one single-cell
flageolet it&#39;s stretching is body little
by little and soon it was so low all the
food they all have very good appetite
and they never stop eating literally you
see another guy with food in its body
will pass by oh here he comes
what I saw confirmed what I learned in
school zooplankton its phytoplankton and
all the plankton are essential to fish
and other marine animals they form the
base of the marine ecosystem I conduct a
research for two years to understand a
very small part of the earth complicated
ecosystem I witnessed the existence of
the ecosystem which motivated me to
think of the importance of protecting
the environment and thus of the impact
of human activities such connection
between knowledge and the real world
brought to me and influenced my career
choice and my worldview I chose to work
in a science museum and I dedicated
myself to learn many ways to help people
to discover a personal relationship to
science I believe that once that
connection is built people will link the
real world with school or books or
television learned knowledge then each
person helped can determine positive
actions to be taken to protect and
sustain this planet of life so today I
will tell you something you thought you
already knew or learn from a science
textbook but you may have never
connected them to your real life
bird with learn birds are important they
eat worms and disperse eat but our
numbers are decreasing why human
activities humans must protect birds
such conclusion is come from scientists
who have studied the real world but just
the thing that produces almost no strong
connections to birds when I was working
on the project introducing Birds I was
lucky to meet with a very well-known
person test in Japan his name is Hillary
she hakushi a professor of talk
university I also read his books to my
surprise the worldview he conveyed to me
about a bird was tender and romantic
very different from cold and dispersal
sighs knowledge I&#39;ve learned from school
he tracked a for birth journey in 2012
each bird had a transmitter that tracked
a location by satellite he said he
enjoyed imagining possible flying rods
and waited with excited anticipation he
was also worried he may receive nothing
if you were the percentage let&#39;s imagine
what kinds of danger the birds would
encounter well there are many dangers
for birds by the rudder condition
environmental pollution decreasing
habitats and the food were high risks of
being killed by hunters receiving
location messages delighted him and his
staff well the four birds were very
lucky after two months
flying over 13,000 kilometers this
faded in arriving at their winter home
these are his results each color means
one birds flying rod the four birds flew
over Japan China Binyam Laos Thailand
Burma Malaysia and Indonesia they&#39;ve
visited some of Earth&#39;s most beautiful
places the Hanoi passport and need a
hotel we all know creators are important
to sustain earth&#39;s ecosystem migratory
birds play an important role to every
site they encounter if one Aryan
environment is destroyed the environment
of another will also have the risk of
being destroyed for example if a rain
forest in southeastern Asia is destroyed
the personnel will normally winter there
may die when the remaining birds return
to Japan Japan&#39;s local environment might
be destroyed because of too few birds to
sustain its forest ecosystem therefore
birds connect the world and the examples
of the indivisibility of the earth&#39;s
ecosystem please imagine that hundreds
of millions of micro birds fly a very
long journey between south and north of
worse every year
they don&#39;t belong to any country but
connect to almost every country&#39;s
environment the thing in your head must
be very beautiful and magnificent this
is the data
published by a famous scientific
magazine in science in 2015 the area in
white offer poor protection for birds
from migratory birds protection in only
one area is all too little international
protection and communication is
essential birds can be observed
everywhere the next time you lose you
tube to the sky and the Sabres flying
I hope this bird story from a scientists
view will help you connect you and your
knowledge to the real world and improve
your personal relationship to this
amazing planet of life another simile
mr. topic is DNA from school we&#39;ve
learned a little bit about ingame and
how its sequence decides your looks and
your body but what doesn&#39;t matter to
each of you right now
currently there are an ever-increasing
number of diseases that can read human&#39;s
DNA but I have a question who do you
like to know your DNA sequence would you
like to know if so please raise your
hand to show me your answer oh but many
thank you
well here&#39;s the good reason for you to
know your DNA
for example if you get a cold you would
take the same drugs as everyone else but
everyone else is different
some get better some don&#39;t and the drug
side effects are different for each
person
in the near future drug stores will give
you customize the types of medicine due
to your personal DNA this technology can
make sure the medicine is appropriate
and the side-effects are at a minimum
well after here is benefit for curing
diseases I would like to ask you one
more time would you like to know your
DNA sequence
please raise your hand show me your
answers
thank you many of you raised your hand
now you are considering now you are
connecting your knowledge to the real
world but reading your DNA may also
bring you trouble when you&#39;re doing it
tells you that you are predisposed to
disease a long term right your disease
that affects your daily life with no
medical cure would you regret reading
routine game there&#39;s another problem
maybe when you find a marriage partner
you may be required to share your DNA to
check if you are a healthy partner or
not your offspring will be smart and
attractive what happens if you fall in
love but your DNA is a bad match this
technology may forever change ways of
finding a marriage partner DNA is our
personal information but how to take
care and a store your day later is yet
another problem it will be difficult to
keep your deaiing a secret because a
piece of hair dropped on the ground and
betray you
the technology is called genetic testing
it will come into your life soon are you
ready I suggest that you talk with your
family or friends about the DNA
technology after the today&#39;s conference
never no wrong or right answers but we
must start this dialogue when you
consider science as a - the way you
choose to use it impacts the happiness
you are pursuing at this point science
is really close to our life no not that
far away or complicate and when you
start to think how size influences your
life or how to use the science for your
happiness you are connecting
your knowledge to the real world and of
creating your future you&#39;ve listened to
three science topics that may have
created fresh perspectives your
knowledge missed the real world I hope I
succeeded in building a connection
between you and the science and then
making you feel that such connection is
very powerful to change your worldviews
little by little there are many ways to
help you connect your knowledge to the
real world
it may be a personal experience a talk
from a scientist a visit to a museum or
an outdoor activity try something new a
way that truly resonates with you
together we can sustain this wondrous
planet of life thank you
