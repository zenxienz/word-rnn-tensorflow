so if you expected me to talk about cars
now I&#39;m sorry the Auto here means
yourself yourself slightly more
complicated in a car I have a book by a
man called Emil kuai it&#39;s called self
mastery through conscious Auto
suggestion inspired and helped
crystallize a lot of ideas for me when I
was writing a play called an oak tree
this this is my copy the book was first
published in 1922 this is a 1932 English
language Edition the book is still in
print today
this is Emil here on the front Emil
Kawai was a French psychologist and
pharmacist who introduced a system of
self-improvement based on auto
suggestion he was the author of the
mantra every day in every way I&#39;m
getting better and better he facilitated
the healing of the sick by getting them
to think that they were well he never
claimed he cured them but that they
cured themselves on the title page of
this book other words our actions spring
not from our will but from our
imagination the book contains lots of
testimonials from people who claim to
have been cured by Monsieur kouhei&#39;s
method
kuai talks about the imagination he
talks about the will he says there is an
absolute rule that admits no exception
the will always yields to the
imagination he writes about the
conscious self and the subconscious self
the subconscious self is where the
imagination resides if we can control
the subconscious he says then we can
release the influence of the imagination
on the moral and physical being of
mankind who&#39;s always very modest in his
claims
there&#39;s no materiality to kouhei&#39;s
practice no surgical pharmaceutical
interventions there is only a set of
conceptual suppositions that in turn
have a material consequence in kouhei&#39;s
case the consequence is better health he
says every one of our thoughts good or
bad becomes concrete materializes
becomes in short a reality the lever for
this process of transformation from
thought into matter is the suggestion
kuai defines the suggestion as the act
of imposing an idea on the brain of
another here&#39;s an example of a
suggestion becoming reality it&#39;s the
epigraph to Timberlake Wharton beakers
play our country&#39;s good it&#39;s a quote
from a 1968 book called Pygmalion in the
classroom by Robert Rosenthal and Lenore
Jacobson twenty percent of the children
in a certain elementary school were
reported to their teachers as showing
unusual potential for intellectual
growth the names of these 20% of the
children were drawn out of a hat eight
months later these unusual or magic
children showed significantly greater
gains in I queued and did the remaining
children who had not been singled out
for the teachers attention the change in
the teachers expectations regarding the
intellectual performance of these
allegedly special children had led to an
actual change in the intellectual
performance of this randomly selected
group who were also described as more
interesting as showing greater
intellectual curiosity and as happier so
the teacher the teachers were given the
suggestion that these children had
unusual potential the children received
the suggestion that they had unusual
potential suggestion is conscious it&#39;s
an act of will demonstrated by how we
act or what we say with an auto
suggestion however kuai defines it as
the act of implanting an idea in oneself
by ones
an auto suggestion is subconscious it&#39;s
an act of the imagination it&#39;s an auto
suggestion that will enable the child to
finally recognize their suggested
potential we teach through suggestion
and we learn through Auto suggestion and
the first play that I wrote was a play
called my arm and it&#39;s a it&#39;s an
autobiographical piece about me living
with one arm above my head until I die
it&#39;s told very simply in the first
person like I&#39;m talking to you now and
no point in the telling of that story do
I ever actually raise my arm above my
head a couple of years ago I met a woman
who had seen me perform the play a few
years before and she&#39;d had a question
that she always wanted to ask me didn&#39;t
it hurt she asked you having your arm
above your head during the show didn&#39;t
that hurt in the history of that show I
have never raised my arm above my head
in performance I suggest that that&#39;s my
situation there was this woman&#39;s
subconscious who had authored an auto
suggestion that I had actually done so
that I physically did that she had seen
it as kuai insists the will always
yields to the imagination the
subconscious is stronger than the
conscious it can rewrite what we are
shown as artists I think we need to
consider the subconscious or at least
play to its ability to see things that
aren&#39;t there I don&#39;t mean hallucinations
or optical illusions by I mean seeing
things not with the eye I suppose not
with the retina but seeing things in
here in the mind the stuff that the
artist Marcel Duchamp described as anti
retinal anti retinal art co-authored
between the artist and the audience&#39;s
mind
let&#39;s make art that is at the service of
the mind stuff seen in here lasts longer
maybe certainly has a more profound
effect this is the site of theater what
happens on stage is secondary to what
happens in here
I think no amount of forceful imposition
of the will or the suggestion can
achieve a result without the subjects
subconscious being ready to receive it I
can stand on stage and tell you that I&#39;m
Hamlet I can be dressed like a moody
prince the stage can be made to look
like a castle but unless your
subconscious receives my suggestion and
authors are corresponding Auto
suggestion then I&#39;m just a man in a room
wearing someone else&#39;s clothes and
talking someone else&#39;s lines the active
principle of artistic transformation
resides in us the audience and not them
the performer much attention is paid to
helping an audience connect with its
subconscious theaters are designed to
make us as unaware of our physical
selves as possible were placed in the
dark in comfortable conditions focused
away from our fellow audience members
but I think the process is more robust
than that I think the leap between
consciousness subconscious from
suggestion to auto suggestion is much
more effortlessly achieve and often with
the most simple of requests the most
obvious of contracts think of a
storyteller think how little they need
talk of the subconscious can make it
sound like some kind of mystical
experience but I think it&#39;s all very
matter-of-fact maybe we over complicate
things by talking about belief in the
theatre a believable character the
suspension of disbelief I never ask you
to believe that my arm is above my head
kuai doesn&#39;t use the word belief he
doesn&#39;t write that we should believe in
the suggestion he writes about thoughts
and about thinking our thoughts become
actions thought is enough to affect the
transformation to author and auto
suggestion if we think this thing then
it is so in Shakespeare&#39;s Henry v the
prologue says think when we talk of
horses that you see them printing their
proud hooves in the receiving earth
Shakespeare respects our imagination and
Ward&#39;s it with the task of seeing things
that are not shown think when we talk of
horses not believe piece out our
imperfections with your thoughts
the prologue says I hope Scheck Spears
being falsely modest when he talks about
imperfections if by imperfections he&#39;s
apologising for not having had the
budget to get real horses then we&#39;re all
screwed a real horse doesn&#39;t allow for
an auto suggestion a real horse is a
real horse
our subconscious is bashed over the head
with a real horse let the imagination
think of a horse and our subject
subconscious goes to work theater can
sometimes overwhelm our hungry fertile
imaginations by not giving them enough
to do which is another way of saying by
doing everything for them
the play I mentioned earlier an oak tree
the play that was some part inspired by
Emile kuai has two actors in it I&#39;m one
of them and the second actor is
different every time the players perform
they walk onstage at the beginning and
they&#39;ve never seen or read the play it
can be any adult age any gender color
shape size anything they wear their own
clothes an oak tree gives them all the
same character to play a grieving father
named Andy at the beginning of that play
I describe the character to the second
actor you&#39;re 46 years old I say you&#39;re
you&#39;re 6 foot 2 your lips are cracked
your fingernails are dirty you&#39;re
wearing a crumpled gore-tex jacket your
trousers are muddy your shoes are muddy
you have tremors you&#39;re unshaven your
hair is graying and you have a bloodshot
eye this is the suggestion it&#39;s received
by the audience and the character
appears it appears in the form of the
second actor the at who doesn&#39;t know
that played act of any adult age any
gender color shape size etc the
character appears but not through the
retina the auto suggestion is made think
when I talk of this man the
to see him theater is predicated on
processes of suggestion and auto
suggestion of imposing an idea in the
brain of another and then that idea in
turn becoming part of self Auto kuai
again if the imagination the will ever
in conflict the imagination will always
win the artists work and only ever be a
suggestion
yeah note a liner a gesture an
alteration to the everyday a story but
that suggestion only becomes an art
principle when it is engaged in as an
auto suggestion in the mind of the
audience
art does not exist without an audience
Marcel Duchamp again the creative act is
not performed by the artist alone as a
side note I&#39;d like to them I&#39;d like to
advocate an or a school of audience yet
or rather in this royal Conservatoire
suggests that the first term of every
course should be spent just being a
receiver just understanding the
receivers contribution to the creative
act and understanding that every work
that we make in this place is made in
the shadow of the audience&#39;s stronger
existence the process of transference
from conscious or subconscious happens
all the time
it needs no trigger kuai describes to
set the auto suggestion as an instrument
that we are born with and which we play
with unconsciously all our life like a
baby plays with a rattle our minds are
conditioned to impose an idea in
themselves by themselves they are hungry
for it they need no prompting if
anything it&#39;s the it&#39;s the opposite the
more effort we put into the suggestion
then maybe the harder it is for the
receiver to make it part of self we pack
the creative act with material with
crazy adult notions around technique and
training and specialism and illusion and
authenticity and talent and virtuosity
and capital and sadly Fame and celebrity
these only seem to tilt the playing
field away from the audience
kuai says that
Auto suggestion is nothing but hypnotism
hypnotism when we think about hypnotism
in the discourse of art then things
start to happen for me in that player
note through the character that I play
is a stage hypnotist crudely this is how
hypnotism works the conscious self the
will is distracted by some means or
other are swinging watch or a physical
or mental activity or an alteration to
the everyday while the conscious mind is
distracted the hypnotists can access the
subconscious the imagination once the
subconscious is a breast then anything
is possible and no material support is
needed is needed to to transfer effect
that change what kuai says is that an
engaged imagination repudiates the will
and dominates the conscious processes of
the everyday I studied when I was
developing an oak tree one particular
stage hypnotist and I used some of his
techniques in the early sequences of the
play so this is how it works
volunteers are called for from the
audience and then they are filtered
based on their levels of suggestibility
so suggestibility is tested through a
very simple actor and imaginary weight
being placed on the are more hands
clamped together and then imagined to be
inseparable
once the hypnotist is working with
people who are open and suggestible then
the subconscious can be addressed
directly simply effortlessly
matter-of-factly for example and the
hypnotist says to the subject are a
given signal say you won&#39;t see my body
or just see my head floating in space
the signal is given and the subject
leaps backwards in fear this is anti
retinal art the instructions are overt
and obvious ya know sleight of hand no
trickery no illusion technique training
authenticity virtuosity capital
celebrity Fame blah blah blah just just
a receptivity a suggestion and an auto
suggestion so what what if we think that
an audience a theatre audience is in a
state of hypnosis
that it&#39;s subconscious is open and it
really wants to do some work how does
that thought release us as
theatre-makers
how little do we need to make art thanks
for listening
