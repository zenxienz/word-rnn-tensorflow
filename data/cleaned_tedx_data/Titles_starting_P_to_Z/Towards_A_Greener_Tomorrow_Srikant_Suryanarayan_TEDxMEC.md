what comes tomorrow is a question that
is going to rattle everybody and
attracted me 10 years that attracted me
exactly or I would save more than 7
years back and let me tell you what I
thought of what would be the mind
tomorrow sitting about system doesn&#39;t
end I was very clear that I wanted to do
something that&#39;s going to put India on
the map I was very clear I didn&#39;t want
to do something or the just the normal
thing I want to do something out of the
ordinary I didn&#39;t want to go under me to
kind of charlatan I said let me see what
I need to do for tomorrow but that&#39;s
very clear whatever I do it has to be at
a scale that is going to put India on a
map or honor exporters map or honor
manufacturers now or on a global map
that India has never done before that of
my first primary objective of what comes
from all that for the first and then
what I did was I&#39;d want to combine my
aspirations with the countries
aspirations because I truly believe in
India success story I truly believe that
you are in a country that is capable of
coming up with amazing success and
that&#39;s when I thought I should somehow
try to combine my own aspirations with
the country&#39;s aspirations and literally
look at something else - correction and
then I decided it has be India and self
not self in India because when you have
a purpose success will follow and when
you have a purpose money beautiful when
you follow money you will not have any
other cover that later in the talk
I want to talk about enterprise because
that&#39;s what my background is I am NOT a
bureaucrat I&#39;m not a technical I&#39;m up on
top I&#39;m a businessman I do business so
for me it&#39;s all about in enterprises
while my life build enterprises I also
have to focus on what I need to in terms
of transformation of my existing
enterprise I also have to worry about
what how am I gonna do the work I&#39;m
trying to say is mecha mob bosses how do
I transform an existing business by
literally killing it by literally
changing the life form by literally
changing the life form without killing
it and creating a new business that&#39;s
exactly what I thought would you might
come over seven years back I had an
existing business I had an existing
enterprise I had a well set business I
had a well set comfortable pushy life
that I could have just put my feet up
and Saturday I said no that&#39;s not enough
Mike tomorrow can&#39;t just be the same
forever so for me it was also a question
of converting of changing or
transforming the existing business which
was a difficult training organization to
a manufacturer just to put it in
perspective I&#39;m going to repeat that my
tomorrow was about how do I transform
myself from a trader or manufacturer
that was a question that after me and
technically very clear Mike tomorrow is
not about one day if I was planning a
business it was thinking of an
enterprise my enterprise has to see 20
years it has to survive the next 10 20
years it&#39;s just not about a three-year
business plan or a five-year business I
will interpret as as I could be part of
the conversation so friends when you
talk about tomorrow it&#39;s not about a day
it&#39;s not about one week it&#39;s not about
one year it&#39;s not a five-year and lacan
it&#39;s not a five-year business plan that
you&#39;re writing
so what if I told you that all the
what-ifs that I said what if I create an
organization which is actually good for
something for India what if I am able to
do transformation of my company from
trading into work and actually all the
waters what if I told you that in 2017
today 60 to 70 plus another water circle
whatever I wrote down as waters in 2010
today I think I have done most of it I
think that I can say I would have
covered about 6070 personal letters it
has happened and still not will stop all
days and I&#39;m still talking about reality
that I have achieved in the past seven
years I think let me talk about the
topic what comes tomorrow towards a
greener tomorrow I don&#39;t think in 2017
receptive aid I don&#39;t think the debate
at all about me going about
sustainability about doing something
correctly doing something like me
I don&#39;t think students people across
this across the food a garment you have
the
I don&#39;t think maybe Texas there is no
debate and say tomorrow this is all
about going green about sustainability
about printing enterprises that is going
to be sustainable to interpret their of
environment going to take care of to
take their home you name it I don&#39;t
think you can talk anything religious
believe it so how can you even consider
a question that the moral should it be
clean I think the moral should I be tax
compliant I mean I&#39;m all of you are in
the engineering earth must be doing some
kind of business plan and the right of
business plan today which is not legally
compliant or which does not take care of
accident and you even think about it
will your teacher ever tell you of video
profits ever did you come and go ahead
to it it&#39;s okay so please it&#39;s not about
the process it has to become your DNA
unfortunately what has happened as in
our country we think about green is not
equal to government and we are a country
of sixty sixty-five percent we go they
have
the one only have it in us to achieve
that record isn&#39;t it each one of your
response to me you see that you&#39;ve seen
them that you change that statement and
say that yes we can do it from green and
secret whatever is it not possible I can
tell you it&#39;s possible I have done it
even I probably thought a few years back
tap water scream what the term and
poking up development without you know
harming a little bit of eggmanland
all those questions do properly but I
can tell you that if you think about if
you actually do things properly then
this sub provision is a way for you to
actually have development without
actually we can do development keeping
three going three being sustainable you
can think about the local ecosystem
suspect the problem is when we think of
being think about development on one
side of the coin and we think we know
it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the same cycle I think
it&#39;s time for us to change
I&#39;m gonna talk about something that&#39;s
each one of us so each one of you have a
choice or a path either you can become a
job provider either you can be splitting
a million dollar enterprises or you
could be dreaming of working for a
million dollar rectangles is there any
other stock process in this room no
things you could either be part of a
million billion dollar enterprise
working for it
or you could be building your own vision
billion dollar enterprise --is going out
into the market so when I say note that
this is not the electron what I&#39;m
talking about
I know there&#39;s not a platform for making
but it was featured but I&#39;m talking
about
none of the above each one of you have
the option created for you to say that I
will not choose a BCP I will choose my
own path that&#39;s what I refer to as not
of none of the above amiable choose any
of this that are brought through as
campus recruitment of campus basis I&#39;m
going to do something on my own I want
to do something that I think I can do
better
did our parents have that option
most of our parents most of our
generation are intemperate generation be
the first job they join their attack on
the top they believed in loyalty they
believed it sense of purpose working for
a single organization pretty much the
Japanese speak you know the Japanese
once if a Japanese one she joins a
company the company becomes his family
and he literally he or she lived to be
or retires from the pump
things have changed today if you worked
a few if your CV says you&#39;re worked in a
company for five years it looks bad
yesterday that was not the case today
that&#39;s the case earlier people are
talking about loyalty to the company has
to think about stock options
think about incentives talk about you
know growth with purpose let&#39;s grow
together those are the kind of
terminologies earlier attrition was
never a balance sheet item a company
never spoke about the accretion it was
never a key indicator today attrition in
an industry they say 13 percent
attrition in this industry HP okay see
how things have changed from the oil
think that one person worked in one
company will actually efficient becoming
a key performance indicator of the
company it could be good it could be bad
but that&#39;s tomorrow
people are erased whether you like it or
not
not about model I think when when we
talk about why we say that we should
start taking steps for tomorrow because
maybe come on
so I think today I&#39;m going to cheat that
when I eat what I want my diet starts
from tomorrow
that doesn&#39;t happen into you our
tomorrow starts now
but you can&#39;t undo the moment that just
passed you but I can&#39;t undo the words I
just said I can only undo the words and
good same way I think you cannot undo
what this would happen you can do what
this would happen from pretty unless so
might the motor start to play it doesn&#39;t
start with tomorrow morning tomorrow
noon tomorrow just reparation for the
motor starts now
it&#39;s one of my favorite topics so I can
go on about this topic Silver&#39;s I&#39;m sure
everybody&#39;s heard to stop this
terminology called
being bonded the silver school other
completed by saying being gone to cyber
school in the small how many of your
photo
how many of you think I am thank you but
I&#39;m gonna prove you just wrong
being on the silver spoon particularly
references when you are on a family that
had a bell purpose and they could won&#39;t
accomplish anything because money wasn&#39;t
sure buying back the better there was
nothing else annoyed did you look at
that you could say that in India there
were many people born of the citizen but
let me take a different perspective I
had the fortune of being part of an
organization from the young Indians and
I was actually heading east Indian
organization for the g20 this was in
Moscow and in Mexico so this is a report
that comes out and as the g20 which the
head of nations that happened that also
the youth of the country that they meet
every - every year under the hundred of
g20 the youth actually prepares a
communicator and gives it to their
government who in turn paper set up a
demon
can you believe that 78% of the g20
countries for the youth in 77070 a
person a human goes 20 currently
actually think access to finance is a
major issue
that music
70% of the g20 countries you think that
access to finance is the biggest issue
or the impediment in their sizes so if
it means you say that I can&#39;t raise
money to Moyes that&#39;s not an amazing
issue of NEC passionate issue it&#39;s a
Tokyo issue it&#39;s a argentina - it&#39;s a
Mexico issue it&#39;s a Moscow issue it&#39;s an
Australia tea so where is the issue of
what silver spoon being born access to
finances there everybody is having the
same problem but if anybody in that 20
countries say that did they say that I
have the problem and getting information
nobody said that I have a difficulty in
getting information I have noted I have
difficulty getting knowledge no hence
I&#39;d like to change that silver spoon
theory that each one of you have a
silver spoon in your mouth because you
have access to information you have
access to knowledge
you have a scene you are on the same
back foot as a 78 person of the using
throughout the world or in at least the
g20 countries as far as financial sense
whereas for you the finance become the
first stumbling block in your thought
process when you want to do something
please remove
now coming back to the silver spoon
somebody said I&#39;m going to save us
wouldn&#39;t let me let me see my my
father&#39;s a botanist he was a government
Club
my mother is a 10 standard my father
Schuck just on the job and became a
watch the parrot and a photographer my
grandfather was a watched repeller and
he used to work in the temple my other
grandfather the garment 7 working the 10
working for the camera government in 200
I will admit that I was born at the
silver spoon but not in my mouth
somewhere on the facts because whatever
distance that was built over the past 30
40 years he has been a father Anthony is
the biggest package that one can attack
when I referred to the silver spoon when
I refer to the weight of the silver I am
referring to the Bagley&#39;s I&#39;m referring
to the expectations we could have when
you&#39;re part of a large mitches larger
the business lot of expectations larger
the expectations under the baggage
larger the baggage in other the fall
that you definitely window so while I
was honored the silver spoon but let me
tell you friends that silver spoon of
see never in my mouth
I was always reminded that you have a
is that your talent so what did I do
what can I do I have a huge package I
have it tomorrow that I want to achieve
how do I go about it I said the only way
I can move order this thing&#39;s not think
out of the box
lick lick get out of the box everybody
says please come out of the box tone to
another me to kind of again I mean one
step ahead and said let me get out of
the box as for the silver spoon clearly
I need not get out of the box I can move
my feet up interpret comfortable see
around the time there is a lot of
self-doubt that happens in you that&#39;s my
name such as my name is Shaytan so I
never saw everybody thought that this
butter is not going to do anything it
can&#39;t do much because the kind of when
you join a business I join my business
when I was not twenty years back because
a thirty year old business at some stage
you think that you are much smarter than
your father
at some stage you start thinking that
you know you have the knowledge you have
the education and you
to wonders but then at some point in
time you fall down and you get hurt and
then you realize that you made thunders
so I&#39;ve been through the entire gamut of
phenomenal blunders shutting businesses
down starting new businesses making
making a company make a complete ass of
myself certain times but at every stage
it was a huge learning because every
person that I started I loved I was able
to learn so octopus recon and then I had
to make sure that I can literally say I
can do it that was the first thing I did
and one aspect that really helped me
that was when I was talking to was for
my running i sat on I&#39;m not running away
from a profit but panic attacks that
really had pitched transform myself from
speak translucent and because on day one
I couldn&#39;t run even hundred meters so
what does it mean what does running
teach or what does any sportage what I&#39;m
trying to communicate to you will do
something that pushes your physical
boundary
do something that pushes your makeup on
it&#39;s not the follicles
it&#39;s Venu big account
Plus me it&#39;s not the fall that hurts
it&#39;s when you hit the ground that hurts
you more so my dear friends getting it
get it as much as possible but don&#39;t
point to the count and even if you do
point to the come get up thank you
[Applause]
