I&#39;m going to start by taking our minds
to another realm for a moment now this
isn&#39;t a distant place filled with
sunshine and daisies in fact it&#39;s a very
tumultuous place we are entering the
mind of a teenager and it&#39;s going to get
real real fast
you are sitting in the front seat of
your blue 1996 Isuzu Rodeo you have all
of your possessions in the backseat
anything that means anything to you and
that&#39;s including clothes and toiletries
you&#39;re in this position because you
witnessed severe domestic violence in
your home the night before and despite
doing what you could to keep the
situation safe including calling 9-1-1
the offender is back in the home so you
chose to leave you continue going to
high school and you&#39;re early to classes
even every day even though you were
sleeping on someone&#39;s floor or the night
before you have absolutely no idea what
the consequences would be if you
actually shared your whole story so you
keep silent you graduate that year with
both honors and Career and Technical
Education diplomas so everything&#39;s going
fine right fast forward three years
you&#39;re in a relationship and you saw
domestic violence so even though this
relationship isn&#39;t all that great all
the time that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s
unhealthy right I mean he punches holes
in the walls
he backs you into a corner until you
admit that he&#39;s right he controls where
you go what you wear who you talk to
but he loves you unconditionally so
that&#39;s love isn&#39;t it you have a friend
who keeps asking you why you&#39;re still
dating this guy every time she gets to
talk to you you&#39;re always talking about
a new fight that you&#39;ve had you see
every why question is going to lead to a
defensive answer it happens naturally
like this she asks why did he do that
today you say well he was tired
she asks why did he do that last week
you say well this is just one of those
moods you know just one of those days
she asks why did he treat you like that
you say it was my fault now I&#39;m going to
bring it right back to reality here
because I have something really
important to tell you this is my story
and it wasn&#39;t until a friend asked me if
you started dating this guy today
would you still want to enter a
relationship with him and I said
absolutely not and it was in that moment
I realized I needed to leave that
relationship you see it wasn&#39;t until I
answered that question that I realized
domestic violence or teen dating
violence which is what we&#39;re talking
about today looks different from the
inside out
like I said I saw domestic violence that
was obvious but when I was in the
position of defending someone who was
verbally abusing me I lacked the
resources and knowledge necessary to
know what was really going on so I&#39;m
here today because I&#39;m taking my
experience and I&#39;m turning it into a
reason to pursue prevention of teen
dating violence domestic violence is a
cycle that can continue beyond the four
walls of the home it occurs in it
affects the lives and relationships of
everyone in the home but particularly
the youth who are trying to figure out
what they deserve in relationships and
so by focusing on the youth in our
community through encouraging positive
affirmations mentoring relationships and
early intervention we can break the
cycle of teen dating violence so
starting with positive affirmations I
will tell anyone that yoga saved my life
it taught me how to control my breathing
which taught me how to control the panic
attacks I was having it taught me to be
mindful to be aware of my mind and my
body and to tell myself that I am worth
it positive affirmations are statements
we repeat to ourselves over and over
until we truly
then encouraging positive affirmations
in youth helps them to know their worth
because it is coming from the inside out
if you can think back to being inside
the mind of that teenager and then to a
place where you know you deserve respect
and healthy relationships can you
imagine how empowering that is to now be
here and so although positive
affirmations are fantastic for everyone
let&#39;s start that habit young now for
mentoring relationships I know the mind
of a teen can be an intimidating place
but if we care about these teens and we
want them to have healthy relationships
we can&#39;t be afraid of having those tough
awkward conversations because the truth
is their lives are kind of tough and
awkward right now so be available for a
teen that you know this goes for boys
too because it&#39;s not just girls who are
in need of positive role models takes
two people to be in a relationship and
both sides are deserving of this
attention and information the common
discourse surrounding domestic violence
relies on the model that the girl is the
victim or survivor and although that
primarily is what is reported we have to
be thinking about under reporting and
also the stigma associated with any
person of any gender identity who is
wanting to share their story these teens
are seeking validation that they are
doing something right along this journey
and you can be the one to sit down with
them tell them that you care and hear
that story build trust in that
relationship not by giving advice but by
being there opening up that space and
validating their worth for my topic of
early intervention I&#39;m feeling the need
to step up onto a soapbox although I&#39;m
feeling this little red dot is a soapbox
in and of itself and say that we need
evidence-based curricula to supplement
the sexual education our youth are
receive
in middle and high schools this topic
falls under the umbrella of teen dating
violence and is also something that I
experienced I realize this watch could
potentially be watched from all over the
world
and if you&#39;re in a place where this is
currently happening in your community
great keep going but listen to my
reasons as to why it is so important our
sexual education classes need to be
coupled with information about respect
and consent we can talk about the act
and the diseases and the consequences
and any of those topics that are bound
to increase the awkwardness in any room
but are we talking about how to say no
are we talking about how it&#39;s okay to
say no that even if you&#39;re being
threatened you can say no that it&#39;s
never your fault but even if it&#39;s
someone you&#39;re dating you can say no
that if this happens to you you can
access resources and get help because we
need to be talking about these things if
we are going to encourage positive
affirmations in our youth they need to
know their worth in every single
situation they come across we can all do
more to support the advocacy efforts of
organizations who provide potentially
life-saving services I&#39;m asking you to
have awkward conversations with teens
where you might want to have some tools
in your toolbox going in so that you
know how to respond appropriately one
National Organization with incredibly
useful resources is called break the
cycle you can write it down it&#39;s break
the cycle org I have recently seed
seized some opportunities to assist them
in planning their teen dating violence
Awareness Month which happens every
February my contributions this year are
going to be talking about positive
affirmations I find myself printing out
every handout that they have and now
that you know about this resource you
too can utilize those tools and
contribute to their efforts if you can
because that is how we raise awareness I
want to thank you all for making the
prevention part of my
heartbeat a little bit stronger today
you now have the ability to leave here
talk about what you heard today and do
something about it because you have the
ability to empower youth in your
community and to make a difference in
their lives
so Master positive affirmations yourself
and then share what worked for you take
a teen out to lunch and give them that
space to have an awkward conversation
support adding evidence-based curricula
to your middle and high schools and also
the advocacy efforts of local state and
national organizations that surround you
break the cycle of teen dating violence
thank you
