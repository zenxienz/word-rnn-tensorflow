it&#39;s a question we&#39;ve all been asked at
some stage in our lives and the response
might to be violin bass resort ballerina
T TV star celebrity but I&#39;ll bet very
few if any of us actually sat there and
said I want to be a leader that&#39;s how it
happens we follow our interests we build
up our expertise and then suddenly it
creeps up on us one day you turn around
and you&#39;re responsible for leading
others you know now some people may set
s dollar from a very very early age but
typically we drift in to those
leadership positions or well promoted
into them what happens then he gets
spent on the leadership development
course that&#39;s where the problems really
do let me give you some numbers fifty
billion dollars that was the global
spend on leadership development at all
last year eighty million one hundred
thousand that&#39;s the number of results my
laptop gave me this morning when I typed
leadership development into a well-known
search engine two million three hundred
and forty thousand apparently that&#39;s the
number of YouTube videos he thinks is
that leadership development in the title
to a hundred and eighty three thousand
five hundred the number of books on
amazon.com UK about leadership
development so many more if you go on
amazon.com you don&#39;t want to
published in the last 30 days so what
does that tell us people read a lot of
books the leadership development
industry is alive and kicking let&#39;s turn
it round let&#39;s think of other figures
now a recent Fortune survey 7% for the
CEO surveyed said that they felt their
companies had developed effective global
leaders only 7% so what&#39;s happening in
the other 93% in the same survey 10% of
the CEOs said the leadership they had
invested in the leadership development
they spent their money or had had a
discernable business impact so what on
earth went wrong in the other 90% of
cases and if you go back over three to
five years respected organizations like
Deloitte Price Waterhouse Cooper
McKenzie&#39;s they&#39;re giving us the same
messages including the same picture the
telling us this huge investment going
into leadership development the
companies are still saying that how many
effective leaders they need is one of
her top three challenges now there&#39;s a
pattern here I don&#39;t expect you to
remember those numbers but if we think
that we had an important Alcoa
leadership development we have an output
which should surely be more effective
leaders there&#39;s a disconnect we&#39;ve got a
gap I spent 15 years studying that gap
for the first 10 years I did it by going
through all the academic community and
synthesizing everything that they had
written all the research leadership
leadership development all the models
the theories the frameworks the concepts
the styles the approaches that we all
know and love I found I was asking the
same question time and time again at the
same time I was working with leaders in
new life situations the full spectrum
leaders from from their supervisors to
see
these is from aspiring leaders to
well-established public to private
sector leaders in the UK to leaders in
the Middle East
and I still came up with the same
question is the leadership development
really broken are we investing money in
something that&#39;s more longer fit for
purpose so I have to look first penny as
I switched my focus instead of
considering the import I said less
what&#39;s happening with this output let&#39;s
look at the leaders what is it that
makes the leaders so much more
successful than others what makes them
tick what is it that they do that others
don&#39;t and I call that group the elite
leaders now let&#39;s be quite clear and
don&#39;t define linked by anything to do
with class or wealth or power or
influence elite is about the quality of
their talent the impact that they have
and the influence that they can bring to
bear and working with these elite
leaders the message became so simple
they said don&#39;t talk to me about
leadership development leadership
development does not develop leaders
I&#39;ll say that again
the official development does not
develop leaders okay we need a new
interpretation here we need to think
about our vocabulary we need to be
precise in our terminology leadership is
a process every organization has
processes therefore it already has
leadership in place to a greater or
lesser a lesser extent thing is from the
processes you&#39;ve experienced
communication negotiation recruitment
induction strategic planning all setting
team briefings they&#39;re all processes
that fundamental building blocks in any
organization that the infrastructure
that allows the leadership to function
but their processes leaders are people
you can teach your process but you build
capacity in people so let&#39;s think of
another example
let&#39;s consider driving a car you can
teach someone to drive that&#39;s teaching
the process but does that mean that our
roads are free flowing and safe because
everybody every single one of us is a
good and effective driver of course not
because it&#39;s how do people behave when
they&#39;re driving when they&#39;re carrying
out that process for somebody to be a
good and effective driver they need to
be able to see themselves as the driver
they need to know how to behave in
different circumstances and situations
to put weather conditions and they need
to learn to be a driver so this is about
identity they need to see it they need
to know how to behave and they need to
be it since through leadership they have
all the leadership processes we&#39;ve just
talked about there for anybody to be
effective as a leader
they need to see themself as a leader in
the first instance they need to
understand how to behave as a leader in
different situations and circumstances
before they can even think about being a
leader so this made me stop and think we
need a totally different approach a
totally different regimes think of it as
a fitness regime to develop leaders to
develop the capacity for people to be
the leaders and as with any regime there
are rules and the first rule is it&#39;s got
a hood it&#39;s got to be part of your
routine it&#39;s got to be built into your
day to day practice you must have a very
very clear baseline your starting point
which means you&#39;ve got to be prepared to
measure yourself and the way is starting
you&#39;ve got to know exactly what you&#39;re
trying to achieve so you&#39;ve gotta have
that picture that representation of what
a leader is and how a leader behaves
he&#39;s then going to pick the right
exercises the right strategies and
techniques to make those small
incremental steps on your journey and
improvement means you&#39;re gonna have to
challenge your mindset
if you have to maybe unlearn some of
your behavior and learn some new
patterns of behavior it&#39;s going to hurt
gonna have to work through the pain and
it&#39;s not going to happen overnight
because although we can teach stone in
processing we have to build capacity
into people so what does this Fitness
companying look like well I have a kid
that you&#39;ve got three sets of muscles
your first set of muscles are called you
challenge muscles and those muscles are
they&#39;re very specifically to create the
identity to establish that understanding
of how the leader should behave not how
your job title or your authority or your
status or what somebody suggests you
should behave looks like
but how will leader should genuinely
behave and that&#39;s the starting point
your challenge muscles they are worked
through self-reflection so this is about
having a clear internal representation
this is my identity as a leader knowing
how to behave in different situations
having the personal power and motivation
to be able to constantly check yourself
I realize nobody else is going to do it
for you to have the belief in yourself
that you are a leader and what that then
does is it puts you in a situation where
you raise your self awareness by raising
yourself awareness you can start to look
externally and ask how other people
perceive me once you know that you will
start to anticipate how they might
respond and once you know that you have
a much clearer idea of the impact you&#39;re
going to have so your first second
muscle see challenge muscles challenge
is about being self-aware his second set
of muscles are you twice muscles because
there&#39;s not quite having this clear
identity in knowing how you might want
to be
if you haven&#39;t got the capacity to do
that so this is the real heavy lifting
this is where you have to put in the
hard work this is way more constantly
changing and developing your behavior
learning new techniques learning new
strategies broadening that repertoire of
behavior that is available to you
your choice muscles are there to develop
flexibility in your behavior you work
them through self regulation by making
conscious decisions how you can behave
and how you are going to continue to
learn your third set of muscles are you
change muscles and this is where you
basically turn up and all your actions
because the change muscles are about how
you self lead there&#39;s no point hiding
into your identity
knowing how to behave developing this
wide range of behavior and they&#39;re not
taking action so three sets of muscles
you&#39;re not gonna learn not on the
leadership development course you&#39;re not
gonna learn about reading a book you&#39;re
not gonna learn that by looking at
YouTube videos this is a fitness regime
to develop capacity for leaders because
the elite leaders they&#39;re practicing
they&#39;re flexing every one of those three
sets of muscles in every circumstance
that they meet and they&#39;re learning
they&#39;re prepared to make mistakes but
they learn from those mistakes so maybe
we have to go back to those 93% of
companies and say you don&#39;t have the
effect of global leaders well maybe you
focus too much on leadership in the
process what about with people did they
know what it meant to be a leader did
you fill capacity in them to be leaders
what about the 90 percent that didn&#39;t
have the discernible
in fact people have impact was it that
the people weren&#39;t exercising and
flexing their muscles sufficiently so
some key messages to leave you with
before you invest any further money and
leadership development leadership the
process leaders of people leadership
development does not develop leaders and
next time someone asked me the question
Leslie what are you going to be when you
grow up I&#39;m going to tell them I&#39;m a
work in progress and I am flexing my
muscles and one day I aspire to be
