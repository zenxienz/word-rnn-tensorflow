I would like to invite you on a journey
through my life to show you how I
changed my perspective on development
aid my name is Katerina Hume
I&#39;m a political activist political
scientist social entrepreneur and
founder of global match I was born in a
small Bavarian village and always wanted
to become either a princess or celebrity
when I was 14 years old my family took
me on a holiday to that Africa one brief
encounter there was life-changing
I talked to in South African girl who
was just as old as I was we even like
the same pop star Hannah Montana and
both of us had dreams of becoming famous
one day the only difference was while I
was traveling with my family she was
selling crafts on a dusty Highway so
this moment was very important to me
because I had a first glance of how it
feels to live my own selfish at all is
in perspective of putting my own
problems into the center of my reality I
realized that the place of birth
determines the opportunities a person
has this made me redefine my own
identity instead of striving for glamour
so no more Hannah Montana I wanted to
contribute I wanted to contribute to a
better world
this meant concretely I wanted to become
a development aid worker for Africa now
what about your dreams I&#39;m sure all of
you have questions about what you want
to achieve in your life flying to Mars
mitigating climate change discovering a
medication against cancer well simply
contributing to a better world right but
have you ever worked together or studied
with someone from Guatemala
Myanmar or Uganda in order to achieve
your own wisdom I would like you to
think of a person from a developing
country what images about this person do
you have in mind I had and sometimes
still have stereotyped pictures about
people from those countries Colonia
thought patterns frame our understanding
of the world as they developed was is a
non developed world but wouldn&#39;t it be
nice to experience the people from those
countries have the same wishes and
passions as we have and furthermore even
reaching innovative solutions if we
learn from other cultures my wish is
that the place of birth should not
determine the opportunities a person has
and my belief is that we have to and can
work together to realize the full
potential of globalization so come
follow me on that journey follow me
through an iron gate the entrance of
samosas children care center
Jinja Uganda you&#39;ll hear the voices of
loving children some are playing
football others just returned from
school you smell the food that is just
being cooked boiled bananas and peanut
sauce I like that
everything seems quite normal except a
white girl that is sitting at the lane
and trying to convince some children to
paint their favorite animal so that girl
was me when I was 17 years old and just
decided to pursue my wish to help Africa
but the one can become the other with a
glimpse of an eye I went to Uganda with
the intention to contribute somehow with
my ideas and my creativity
but I quickly realized that my presence
there could not create any impact I felt
useless I wanted to give but instead I
took at the end this voluntary service
was more about my own personal
development and still trying to find my
identity but I would like to introduce
you to a special person I met in Uganda
this is a downward me oh don&#39;t go grew
up at the orphanage I was volunteering
at and attended high school during my
time in Uganda in 2011 there and also
afterwards we had many discussions about
politics ethics and also how to decorate
our student flat so this let us become
friends
three years after Asma academic interest
got more focus and peace and conflicts
Oh dongho invited me to come again to
Uganda this time he helped me to conduct
a couple of interviews with former child
soldiers in northern Uganda we
experienced a cooperation at eye level
both of us lost the way we work together
in finding out more about the Kony
conflicts and we had deep discussions
about our basic values one day or don&#39;t
go pointed at the street we are walking
on the street was in horrible conditions
potholes every every two week meters
filled with water you know the typical
image of an developing country
he asked me Kutty do you know why this
street is not repaired yet I answered
maybe there&#39;s no money for it he
responded our government has money but
people wait for Europeans to repair our
streets our people don&#39;t believe in
themselves they think that they depend
on her from outside or don&#39;t would hurt
me that there&#39;s a strong disconnect
between the political elite and the
Ugandan government
this made me question the idea of
development aid for the first time and
it made me feel confused does our
approach of development aid make the
situation even worse when I left Uganda
I felt sad why could I easily travel to
Uganda to conduct a scientific research
there and why can&#39;t I don&#39;t go to those
well why are there almost no
scholarships or does anyone of you know
an exchange student from Uganda Kenya or
some Babu at your university why our
board is real for some and not for
others how can we achieve equal
opportunities what institutions are
responsible for that eager to learn more
I participated in a conference of the
United Nations so follow me to New York
Times Square&#39;s Sheraton Hotel a world of
glamour and power 5,000 students from
all over the world came together to
discuss on how to end poverty over the
world well no there was no single
delegation from an African country this
should be a place where we discuss our
future together or dongle should have
been there as well and indeed it is
confirmed the place of birth determines
the opportunities a person has can we
achieve equal opportunities
could it be through development aid
eager to learn more well I studied I
studied political science and in through
my studies in Germany in Spain and
Brazil I learned about post-colonial
theories these concepts explained the
dissatisfaction we felt during the last
minutes quite well let&#39;s take a moment
to think about what the term development
means to develop something means to lift
it from an immature level to a better
form of itself
but who determines what is better the
idea of development implies a difference
between ethnic groups I&#39;m sure you all
know Pocahontas the Native American
princess and you know I tend to like
princess
so her tribe was invited by British
settlers in the beginning of
globalization European colonizers
defined themselves as the top of God&#39;s
creation the native population was
constructed as the opposite deeply
connected to nature uncivilized and wild
this difference
letsa demised the Europeans in taking
over other civilizations taking their
land their women in even selling them as
slaves in the second part of the Disney
movie Pocahontas was carried to England
the movie illustrates quite well how she
had to give up her own attitudes and
values in order to be accepted into
British society during colonization the
understanding of the world was formed
and the identity of both the colonizers
and colonized so Kelowna and colonies
were disconnected from their own
historical timeline and integrated into
the Western economic and value system
today former colonies have formal
independence but they still depend
post-colonial World Order so resources
are still extracted in the global south
but II Walid sane ends in the global
north the development aid or the idea of
development aid comes from the time of
decolonization and is often criticized
as just a reproduction of Western
influence interests so the Research
Institute global financial integrity
estimates that for every dollar of aid a
country receives it loses $24 in net
outflows isn&#39;t that crazy
when Western aid
Satan&#39;s communicate with the picture of
starving black children which would be
futureless without of the help of the
white donor they reproduce dependency
the idea of development implies a
linearity so there&#39;s developing in
Madison and industrialized the places I
showed you represents that as well so
New York Times Square&#39;s versus the
orphanage in Uganda and the developing
world is often stigmatized as rural
traditional people they are lazy whence
the developed world is modern and people
there are rational so the the
development critical author at war
Escobar for de la Marr quite well in two
words development eight is not only a
problem to the extent that it failed it
is even a problem when it succeeded
because it&#39;s so strongly set the terms
of how people in poor countries could
live well it is also it is also a
problem when it succeeded do you feel my
frustration it&#39;s my wish to help
nonsense
our voluntary service is selfish is the
one hundred forty three billion dollar
for Fisher development 84 community
contributes every year worthless when I
took a deep dive into the world of
development aid during my internship at
the ministry for the Federal Ministry of
development and economic cooperation I
met wonderful people fighting for huge
goals but still is development aid just
a drop in a bucket is it at the end just
the reproduction of Western interest is
it a dead end
Oh dong-won I understand our world order
as a semipermeable membrane you remember
that from biology class right a membrane
that allows some particles to enter but
restraints others so our world order
allows resources to travel from the
global north south to the global north
but the wealth of these resources almost
exclusively reaches to govern off it
allows people from one site to travel in
order to work and learn but restrains
people from the other side - mm
ultimately thoughts mainly from the
global north are allowed to enter but
there is no reverse flow of ideas or
don&#39;t go and I strongly agreed that we
have to liquidate that membrane we have
to break through that membrane so we
decided to multiply the connection
detours of had we identified people in
our network who could also benefit from
a cooperation and connected we connected
Simon Frederick to poets who inspire the
world with the literature Borneo Cori
and Cora - medicine students who do
research together and how to treat
cancer Miriam and cells who develop
eliminate together and 100 individuals
more these connections helped us to
break through the membrane of global
inequality patrons bored ideas and
create access to other regions of the
world
I think development aid is not a dead
end but a one-way street the connections
so that cooperation is possible that
there is no civilized versus uncivilized
but instead there is diversity and the
global challenges our global challenges
climate change gender inequality poverty
which are all summarized in the
sustainable development goals
count for the whole word equally and can
only be solved through cooperation so
the organization or don&#39;t when I found
it is called co-op
it is a platform that connects ambitious
young people over the world through
digital media and enables them to
develop ideas and projects together we
are living in a world where my t-shirt
probably traveled more than I did where
ideas could spread within seconds how is
it possible that we are not connected
yet it could be so easy you just take
your phone and text someone and well yes
people do have smartphones there you ask
what is bothering you how is life there
I found out about a cool scholarship why
don&#39;t you apply as well let&#39;s take
through that membrane
let&#39;s switch trip let&#39;s transform the
one-way streets I recommend you to get
in touch with someone from another part
of the world change your perspective
remember when I asked you about your
dreams in the beginning maybe your dream
will come true
you might fly to Mars one day and maybe
together with someone from Uganda thank
you
[Applause]
