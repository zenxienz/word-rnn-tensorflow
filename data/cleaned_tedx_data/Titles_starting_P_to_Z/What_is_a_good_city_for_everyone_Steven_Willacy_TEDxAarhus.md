thank you very much
street benches are lovely things out
they they invite you in and therefore
everyone I would like your walls I&#39;d
like to invite you all to close your
eyes for the next couple of seconds and
think of your loveliest bench experience
it&#39;s time to relax it&#39;s time to think
about the world around you looking at
people engaging with people perhaps
eating your lunch box or looking up in
the trees or even take enough your love
to open your eyes again now I didn&#39;t
mean you should take it seriously with
enough let&#39;s look at some other places
in the city urban spaces take this one
for example a beautiful grass lush and
green inviting but invariably
one of these things comes up into our
heads only eight kinds of it sends some
warnings about the what is urban space
and perhaps it&#39;s not as public as we
actually think it is some time ago I was
in London with my family and I wanted to
look into an atrium of a multinational
company poor children of architects
parents we walked up towards this atrium
this beautiful glass facade and a
security guy came running out towards us
and no uncertain terms said we&#39;re not
allowed to be here
because this is private space it&#39;s not
public but I was tried to discuss this
with him as you know an architect would
but we were actually forced to move back
away from this building so I was
insensitive
ending indignation I started hopping
back and forth between the private space
and the public space private public
taunting the security guy
and my family they were very embarrassed
that&#39;s what I mean poor children of
architects parents another space is one
of these it&#39;s a bush it&#39;s a bush shelter
but it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s actually a
space where people meet before they move
on it&#39;s a meeting place it can also
double up as a living room or a dining
room and of course a bedroom for some
people this is the multifunctional space
within the urban realm it&#39;s a place for
everyone actually and this could also be
said of these steps we see them around
the city and this is a place in the Sun
people like to dwell some people like to
dwell in the urban realm because they
feel most comfortable there
it&#39;s a very important place for them
it&#39;s a kind of ik there&#39;s a strong sense
of community for certain people to get
my drift I make it my business actually
to actually take an interest in people
how different types of people use the
urban realm it&#39;s really important for me
and there are certain groups who I like
to call city people who are out there
daily on a daily basis in that urban
space I&#39;m the city architect in ovals
and it&#39;s very important to me to see how
people are getting on in the urban realm
I spend a lot of time wandering around
and one such occasion I was walking on
my street in the rain and I looked into
a passageway is quite incidentally a
noticed amount of clothing I know I
thought what the hell&#39;s happened here so
I ran in very quickly and it was a
amount of clothing and it was a person
I&#39;m sure he was dead so I rang an
ambulance and a police and they came and
luckily he was alive and I still see
this person wandering around the city
but it made me really think it&#39;s had a
big impression upon me as to how the
city people live within the city spaces
and the urban realm we have one of the
cornerstones of AUSA&#39;s policy is that
we&#39;re making a good city for everyone
the a lot of cities have this ambition
but are we walking the talk are we
making these spaces for everyone this is
not just my city many cities are facing
similar challenges it&#39;s an actually a
global phenomena at the last count in
2015 there&#39;s over 100 million people
city people in the world and 75 million
are moving from the countryside to
cities every year so there&#39;s a lot of
people are going to get left behind
somehow so this issue is not going to
disappear so what do we do what can we
do to improve the situation well I&#39;d
like to start by saying how not to do it
that&#39;s another way take this for example
how many times do I have to say to you
we don&#39;t want you here I mean pyramidal
concrete in this metal bar and similarly
this one I think this one&#39;s in Rotterdam
I mean we actually don&#39;t want you to
stay here very long because it&#39;s quite
uncomfortable
this one&#39;s probably the best I think
it&#39;s a place in France where they
actually caged a bench we don&#39;t want you
here tonight it was actually put up on a
Christmas Eve very friendly so how does
always we would like to work with things
in a different way
I wouldn&#39;t say rethink but is something
being working with for some time some
years back we did a during a old
festival week for ten days we made
shelters for city people we&#39;ve dotted
them around the city three of them one
of these was positioned on the Main
Street in all where people could make a
cup of coffee and sell their local
newspaper to make money for their
existence the second one was positioned
in the Town Hall Park where it became a
stage for city people to make concerts
for the general public and it worked
incredibly well and they have seen since
been moved around different positions in
the city and Walnut Grove Greenlanders
especially used this one down and it&#39;s
become their place it&#39;s their locality
and the design of it is so beautiful I
think designed by the same architects is
this building actually and it&#39;s become
an iconic reference for their this group
of people we have another one most
recently just made this last week it&#39;s
called the back garden it&#39;s designed by
the Green Line community it&#39;s actually
made by them two icebergs and all you
see that there&#39;s a place where they can
actually make food and there&#39;s a small
refrigerator and toilets and things but
the important point is that they&#39;ve
actually participate in the design and
making wreaths so it actually becomes
this perhaps a shelter is too big for
your city in the in terms of the urban
realm things like this perhaps you could
actually look at working with the bench
itself
I found this example in Vancouver very
simple the idea what a beautiful gesture
the generous one it&#39;s not just for city
people but it&#39;s also for everyone and I
think it rains just as much in Vancouver
as it does in halls so let&#39;s be inspired
to do something with that we work with
benches also in office and I think one
of the most beautiful we&#39;ve made
recently which i think is very inclusive
is this design by doc one our new
library it&#39;s designed it could cater for
it&#39;s a lounge so for type of sitting
area but also it&#39;s made for many
different uses you can sit on both sides
and have conversations as these people
show here so there&#39;s a lot of
possibilities here I work in this
building design by a young person and in
our back yard
we have this beautiful piece of art the
same for everyone
and it makes me it reminds me all the
time about the stewardship of our urban
realm and the way people use spaces in
the city it doesn&#39;t matter where I&#39;m
going traveling I just live and breathe
this it&#39;s important for me and I think
it&#39;s also important for us all some kind
of empathy around the way we use the
urban realm this is one of my
interesting examples I think it&#39;s a
boost off which has been converted to a
multifunctional living room when I saw
this image I thought I&#39;m gonna start
doing urban guerilla ism in the city I&#39;m
going to convert bus stops to living
rooms or bedrooms or dining rooms kind
of instant art but the important thing
here I think is city people are also
human beings and it makes me think what
more could you bench be thank you very
much
