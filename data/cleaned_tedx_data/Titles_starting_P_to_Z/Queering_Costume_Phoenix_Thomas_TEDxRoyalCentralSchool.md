so I&#39;m here today to talk to you about
costume I&#39;ve been working with costume
for over a decade now various different
forms theater dance Fringe opera which
was interesting but I&#39;m here today to
talk to you about a different kind of
practice a self-driven practice and more
experimental practice that I&#39;ve been
developing through my research my
practice is research that&#39;s central I&#39;ve
had the opportunity to be able to
explore costume which doesn&#39;t have to
respond necessarily to the dictates of a
director of a choreographer because
quite often within performance in
costume
the production model can be very
hierarchical and creatively speaking
costume is quite often seen as serving
the vision of the director or the
choreographer the creative man normally
on top what I&#39;ve been exploring is a
mode of costume a form of costumers
artistic practice as opposed to autistic
facilitation and I would argue that
that&#39;s that&#39;s quite queer that&#39;s quite
disruptive and that&#39;s something that I
want to explore more and that&#39;s
something I want to invite others to
explore with me so in a standard
production most of the production&#39;s I&#39;ve
worked in as a costume professional I
will be commissioned to do a number of
costumes for a production I&#39;ll have a
production brief I&#39;ll be told you know
your costume this this isn&#39;t this thank
you very much
go away make a list of the different
attributes that I need to be able to
communicate about each character that&#39;s
pretty standard practice that&#39;s the
first thing you&#39;ll do you&#39;ll take your
text away or certainly that&#39;s how I&#39;ve
been instructed and how I do it how a
lot of my contemporaries do it you
it takes away you analyze your text you
pull out notion the empirical facts
about each character from your textual
analysis and you know you interweave
that with other aspects stylistic
elements different thematic vents but
ultimately the question that drives a
lot of costume design and development
certainly my experience and from what
I&#39;ve observed in the work of others is a
question of who is this person who is
this character I want to like you that
that&#39;s a question is that a question
anyone can really answer are we ever one
person are we ever the same person even
from one day for the next if you could
give representation of yourself you know
as we do every day we get dressed we
decide what we&#39;re gonna wear you know
how we&#39;re going to present ourselves if
a costume designer were to take a
biography of your life would they dress
you the way that you&#39;re dressed I don&#39;t
know what would that say about you how
would you feel about that there&#39;s
there&#39;s a kind of objectification to it
what I want to propose is a mode of
costume practice which displaces or
dissenters this sort of universalizing
view of what the language of clothing
should be there is a language of
clothing we do have languages of
clothing that language has different
syntax and and you know different
articulations in different places
different times there are languages of
clothing but they&#39;re not universal
they&#39;re positional their subjective but
with the growth of screen media
especially we&#39;re seeing a lot of costume
design which is trying to appeal to a
broad palette a broad notion of
what different types of people should
look like and clothes do that they sort
of facilitate and encourage an approach
to other individuals other human beings
where we might look at them and make
snap judgments you know the first
impression they say is really important
and it is and so much of that is based
on clothing and that&#39;s one reason why
costume is so important you know we&#39;re
representing identities but what if we
explore a form of costume that doesn&#39;t
necessarily have to represent identities
what if we explore a mode of costume
which looks at the subjective
positionality the experience the haptic
qualities the moments of exchange the
electricity between individuals as a
mode of narrative interpretation do we
always have to take a test and clear
apart into modular aspects of identity
determined according to the the politics
of the day essentially the dominant
politics of the day and those are always
going to be those are always going to be
positional they&#39;re going to be
subjective how we represent middle class
working white woman in in Sussex where I
live it&#39;s gonna look quite different to
middle-class working women working women
in South Africa maybe you know it is
there are geographical variations but so
much at the time costume clothing the
way that we pull these characters apart
is entirely is is in entirely subjective
what I want to propose is a model of
costume which shows that subjectivity
which owns costume as an artistic
creative practice an expressionistic
form of costume practice it wants to be
making snap judgments about people we&#39;ve
never met we don&#39;t know why would we
want to do that maybe to sell movies I
don&#39;t know but there&#39;s so much room for
expansion for development of different
forms of costume different forms of
artistic practice yes naturalism is
dominant now does it have to be does it
have to stay doubling can we challenge
that can we have a resurgence of
Expressionism might be fun that&#39;s
largely why I&#39;m here today to ask you
you to join me in a surge of
Expressionism forget forget purports to
reality reality is wherever you are
that&#39;s your reality it&#39;s not my reality
so here today as a costume practitioner
I want to say and as a costume
practitioner who and an individual who&#39;s
often been marginalized by these
normative standards these standards at
the norm you know what&#39;s normal you know
we think about these things as common
sense but what&#39;s common what&#39;s normal
where does that leave the rest of us who
are the rest of us what&#39;s one what&#39;s the
other if we start to eat if we start to
explore an embrace costume as an
expressive medium we can start to
explore different pleasures different
perspectives different modes of
expression and I think that&#39;s exciting I
think that&#39;s really exciting I mean just
look for example with the way that
people of color have been represented in
performance throughout history through
costume it&#39;s appalling women gay people
transgender people people are faithful
even you know let&#39;s make a change let&#39;s
try and do performance in a way that
okay we can&#39;t leave those politics
behind we can&#39;t leave them behind
they&#39;re a part of our world but isn&#39;t it
worth trying to explore a kind of
Expressionism which can maybe if not
transcends then transgress those
iniquities so
well I&#39;d like to ask you here today yeah
be you performance makers be you you
know be theatergoers be you people on
the internet you have found yourself in
a very strange place indeed I want to
ask you engage with costume as to its
full potential there&#39;s so much there
there&#39;s so much that it is it is the
material medium between the body the
spaces around and and between bodies as
well it doesn&#39;t have to be so following
a centric it doesn&#39;t have to be visual
tick-box
of what kind of person this is why can&#39;t
it be an expression of the electricity
between people that&#39;s by the feeling
that anguish why can&#39;t we approach
costume as a sculptural and and and
tactile and feeling medium does it have
to be about words or can it be about
feelings can it be about things which
are maybe more than words which can be
expressed to words if you can treat
costume as a form of three-dimensional
art or even 4 dimensional art how much
more worth can we bring to it thank you
very much
[Applause]
