we&#39;re going to talk about Lahore the
cultural capital of Pakistan and focus
upon its historic core which you see
here on the map this is the origins of
Lahore which began with a mud wall
surrounded by 13 gates which served as
the exits to the city and this is traced
from the times like 1000 BC when it was
Prince lo the son of a Hindu god Rama
who laid the foundations of Lahore so
Lahore derives its name from lo and over
the years it turned into a huge
flourishing one of the finest cities of
the world and it was John Milton who in
the Paradise Lost mentions that God
tells Adam while speaking to him he says
his eyes might telling telling Adam to
visit Lahore his eyes might their
command whatever stood city of old a
modern fame the seat of mightiest Empire
from the destined walls of Kimberley
seat of Cathy and kin and Semak unboxes
tamest Rome to Paquin of Simeon Kings
and thence to Agra and Lahore of great
mobile so this great city down into the
city with architectural beauty monuments
gardens libraries and it was during the
times of the Mobile&#39;s particularly in
the times of Akbar who brought his
throne for 13 years to Lahore and then
followed by by by John Geary and Shah
Jahan and Janki so this is the city I
wish to just share with you the kind of
beauty that it holds the splendor the
variety the richness and diversity which
spreads over many many civilizations
because it was mammoth Ghazni in 1000
- 6 which means
about thousand years ago from Central
Asia came down and that&#39;s the vivid
living history through followed by them
the Delhi Sultanate who encamped here
else as well and then of course the
times when when when the Blish before
the British it was a six the native rule
which ever came to this land was during
them six times and then took up taken
over by the British followed by 1947
which is our freedom independence of
Pakistan so this city is full of life
it&#39;s not only the monuments it&#39;s not
just a brick and mortar it is the lead
life the the which which is abuzz with
you know bazaars and markets and music
and spices you you if you go there you
you will see so much of energy of people
and the and the harmony and the
hospitality now this is one picture I
wish to share with you is representative
of what led the British to conquer India
the spices it is upper Mundi one of the
largest spice market in Asia are more
than 500 shops exist even today and this
this is what led to the colonization of
the India and the so this the sounds
this the aroma the the very picture of
this look at the metals bazaars you can
go and visit the music bazaars there
there are crafts and skills abounding
the whole city and of course most
important is the cuisine Lahore is not
complete without cuisine and it is a
city which is said which never goes to
sleep because the hall rights keep
eating till three o&#39;clock in the night
and then by four o&#39;clock is the
breakfast time again let&#39;s see the he
and you know booty holla Barack cetera
et cetera so
this is and I&#39;ve seen many cities of
Europe going fading out after the you
know sunset or nighttime but this is
always you know this is our version of
what you call pizza the Kalama the
famous and but most important is the
neighborhood the mahalos how people live
together house adjoining another house
and it&#39;s a house which is a place called
with million rooftops of windows you
know and there are streets are so narrow
says and all the writer writes about it
Jonathan eat tongue Yankee murderer or a
tagger category enter Serafina kaki
Gujarati which translated would mean if
a man and a woman is crossing this
narrow street there has to be a marriage
contract so and and yet the children
they play freely with abandon no
inhibitions of any security or any other
and then everybody knows everybody and
so he is a watch man you could say
always you know overlooking the and not
only that the literature the poetry the
musicians that the sportsmen that have
there have generator come out from from
this particular historic core called the
walled city or the Unruh Lahore Allah my
Kamal the our poet of the East he he
lived there so did gama Palawan the
wrestler of India and knew Jahan our
most famous singer sir Gangaram Hamid
Rafi and many poets and many others but
then what happened is over the time
there has been a decline despite this
being matching any any historic course
that one has seen all over the world
like fairs or Isfahan or summer Cara
Grande bazaars of Egypt and Turkey but
here there has been a decline let&#39;s just
face it a lot of congestion lot of
traffic lot of encroachments and mmm and
cleanliness issues etc etc
so we had to clean our act we had to put
her things together and then the good
thing is that the government woke up to
this reality to this deed and started as
a project in 2006 which became an
authority especially dedicated
autonomous body very few places in the
world would have four it&#39;s a story Corps
which Lahore has which is now my
department called the walled city of
Lahore Authority so we have started with
rehabilitation and revival of off of the
Lahore historic core and it&#39;s not only
dealing with the monuments but it is
basically dealing with the with the
living conditions of the people which
has to be dealt through through the new
infrastructure so we have laid down new
latest sewage lines in these very
congested areas where you you can&#39;t even
pass by they&#39;re there this kind of work
has gone in and we have done about 8 to
10 percent of the walled city till today
but it&#39;s not very extensive it is going
on a good model has certainly set up and
but it&#39;s very intensive work new cr8 new
water lines new gas lines and most of
all the dangling wires above have all
gone under the ground so these are the
conditions in which work has been
carried out and this is a look for
instance the Royal trail through which
the mobile processions used to come
going up to the default this is that
bazaar that is it this is how it looked
like before rehabilitation and this is
how now it looks like and this is
another view of the street and now this
is how it has been done up then this
gully surgeon saying on the left is what
it used to look like and on the right is
after its rehabilitation and this work
has been carried out of course in
collaboration with the arcon trust for
culture now so this is delegate which
has lit up every evening and it says now
bringing in tourism for that the
need to we wanted to clean up the place
and so special efforts have been made in
this regard to keep our streets clean
and the Civic sense has also been
introduced more and more and to two
projects that I wish to mention which
are worth noticing one is the monument
called Shahi Imam it is the Turkish bath
which existed there four hundred years
ago it was built by was Iran the
governor at that time during charge on
Stein&#39;s and going through various phases
it had fallen on bad times but it has
been rehabilitated and so has been the
beautiful ornamental mosque called the
Wazir Khan mosque it has been done in
such a way that we have got UNESCO award
last year for the cultural heritage
conservation of Shahi hammam another big
complement is from a very eminent writer
of of the subcontinent that is William
Darla pal he sometimes went there and
then we found his Twitter saying that
Shia Imam is the best new architectural
restoration project that I&#39;ve seen
anywhere in South Asia this was the look
of the Shia Imam this is how it was
covered by these shops and these wires
all around and this is the look that you
see it now so this is the transformation
this is a change and so is the inner
areas there that we have got now these
ramps through which tourists come and
enjoy the tourism outside on the open
courtyards we have functions sometimes
events and on the top of the rooftop
that there are other events going on so
the whole community the whole area has
been uplifted and involved in this
further up at a walking distances this
was in Masjid which again was barricaded
by many shops there
more than 70 shops which have been paid
up and removed from there and today the
scene has got changed and now from here
these videos were also you know half
covered but you see this slide and you
see the great change so in this very
congestion area securing this kind of
public space is nothing like little
beyond a little miracle you know and and
the the the shudras have all come out
and saved this is an adjoining well gold
Deenanath well and it has also been
preserved
so the besides this tourism and events
are picked up and now we have always in
Pakistan be talking about either
ecotourism which means going to the
nature to the mountains or showing some
some money museum or a monument but here
for the first time it is Mahalo tourism
the street tourism which has picked up
and P people feel joy happiness and even
the youth I am sure have started taking
pride and identity with their own Mahalo
and their own food cuisine and so this
is how we have introduced some regular
rickshaws which you must have seen our
famous international cricket players
also writing this and people coming to
this and then lots of events and
festivals within the walled city open
for all all communities taking part this
is the culture which is shaping up over
there and thank you very much but before
I leave the stage I have to mmm
I have to recite a poem my favorite
Punjabi poem about a whole doll the scar
Darla das Akana shahira lahori under
kini boo hair thickening Ambar eonni now
that&#39;s a car
Oh time
now the saqqaq a rotating a cool item
Kenya - Tina Dakini is our union Darla
dasami Cheryl ahora under Lacan buhay
telecom bar Yanni
Gina counted her gay Paree a shock
oh he - Tia the Bucky the young sorry
honey
so this is a song of lahore this is the
spirit of lahore we have resolved to
bring bat lahore to the glory that it
deserves
thank you very much for your attention
you
