so kota tua a city aged five hundred
years old
also known as Batavia Mahavira was the
old trading port between the Indonesians
and the Dutch for spices spices worth a
lifetime of money a few centuries ago
and I would dare say that kota tua
hundreds years hundreds of years ago
most prosperous city at that time and
those were certainly my thoughts when I
first went to what that was three years
ago I could still remember the scene
vividly I was on the jacquard a good
guide walking through and the first stop
that I made was to this building the
doom boom India and it really attracted
my eye because the because of its white
facade and it looked somewhat like a
theater so I was very interested to go
in and I eventually did and here&#39;s what
I found I expected there on this
building to hold some type of activity
economic activity whether that be a
hotel a restaurant a cafe or even maybe
a museum after all it&#39;s a symbol of our
heritage here in Jakarta but here&#39;s what
I found
here&#39;s what this is the reality behind
the white and beautiful facade an empty
building that still today remains unused
by the way this is to that this building
is 200 years old
and so I wondered at that time is this
the condition of all buildings in Kota
tua or is this only or is this only
occurring for one building but I I would
soon find out that this is indeed the
condition of most buildings in Kota tua
and it&#39;s very most buildings are also
inaccessible and this is because 60 to
70 percent of buildings in collet hua
are privately owned and these businesses
they lose an incentive to actually
redesign these buildings because there&#39;s
not much economic activity in Kota tua
as well as the high very high
maintenance costs for restoring a
century-old building so after that I
thought to myself why can&#39;t go that way
be as well-managed as places like
Malacca in Malaysia or Essen in Germany
or even surakarta in solo and so I
thought to myself I need to do something
about this problem that I&#39;m facing but
in a way I also I also thought back and
I thought to myself I&#39;m still a student
here in in scholarpedia Harappan I still
have other commitments and
extracurricular activities how can I
possibly help caught that WA and so I I
challenged myself I the next day after
visiting that museum I went back to what
Ottawa not to visit more buildings but
instead to talk with the local people at
call that WA because I really do believe
that the best way to know a new city and
a new place is to talk to its locals and
so I remember talking to an ice tea
seller who told me that his ice tea&#39;s
would melt before noon and I also talked
to a hotel lobbyist in a very famous
hotel in Kota tua who told me that the
only visitors to Kota tua are the Dutch
because because the Dutch wants to they
want to visit their ancestral graves and
so that really painted is a very vivid
picture and perspective of Kota tua that
I never had before
and so the next few months the next
three months I I spent I spent my time
building a 3d city plan of kota tua
using the sketchup application and today
i can show you this is what it looks
like i wanted to make a a city plan that
III of my dreams and hopes for ho tattwa
the good new mu media that we we
discussed just now and my plan it would
be a theater showing a play of our
founding fathers and Sukarno across
Fatalis square and my plan there would
be a shopping street full of stores and
areas that were business and local local
businesses could use for restaurants to
sell local souvenirs and such and there
would be more squares and public spaces
in kota tua which is very lacking right
now there would be places where people
like me who like to wander off into
cities where we can go and find a random
coffee shop and maybe talk to a few
different new people and so after
creating this plan I I felt a sense of
well I felt like I accomplished
something
I made a city plan but in a way in the
other hand I also felt that my working
caught that was still not enough by the
way that I made this plan three years
ago and since then I&#39;ve started to find
more ways where I can impact core that
what directly because making a master
plan is great but what what what&#39;s the
value of these ideas if it&#39;s not
implemented and so I established a
student organization called the Kota
tois project and the mission is simple
to transform kota tua using data and
youth empowerment our vision is very
it&#39;s quite daring I must admit it&#39;s to
make Ottawa a UNESCO World Heritage Site
by 2020 and our slogan is caught at wah
hota kita that&#39;s my favorite part of our
profile translate that the translation
is of course
Old Town is our town and after setting
the student organization about a year
ago I lent I learned a lot of valuable
lessons that I would like to share
firstly I learned of the power of
connecting with individuals and
organizations that are like-minded and
so the quartet wha project is based in
my school right here in Scala Peeta
harapan and it was and I founded it
along with five other members five other
friends and as a group we we would
engage with a lot of discussions on a
weekly basis on how to solve the issues
in kota tua but this year we&#39;ve expanded
to twelve of our members another one of
our biggest partners is the consortium
of kota pwah the consortium is a
public-private partnership scheme formed
by President jokowi when he was the
governor of Jakarta and its task is to
solve the issues in Kota tua through the
consortium we have had access to us to a
steady stream of Johar des leaders I&#39;ve
had the privilege myself to talk to and
present to leaders such as ebu mary
panga - which is who is the X Minister
of Trade and the creative economy and
small as parameter who is the head of
the top ten best national destinations
as part of the tourism agency and
Indonesia and so far these these leaders
have really liked our plan but I would
say that my biggest experience in my
life and right up to this point is
meeting pal Hulk during the jindo event
last this year early this year and I
talked to paho our ex-governor regarding
kota tua and i will never forget what he
said to me then he told me that law
respects experts like to tell him that
kota tua will be revitalized by 20 to 30
years but then he said he would always
respond to them by saying that five
years is enough and III really share
this desire because in my opinion
if we put enough faith and belief in
something we don&#39;t need 20 years to
revitalize caught up about five years
since enough and so far we&#39;ve created a
lot of events one of them is a Instagram
campaign that we made last year which
attracted and and this this project was
actually done in order to promote the
revitalization efforts in Kota tua and
we didn&#39;t expect much as a team we
didn&#39;t have a lot of funds and financial
incentives and we mostly relied on word
of mouth on social media but at the end
we gained our over 400 participants and
these are some posts that show the
project we have also co-hosted events
with a consortium of potahto Jakarta it
was a speaking event this year it was
called a kickoff revitalization in Kota
tua and after speaking we would paint
repaint a building with with some of the
leaders in Kota tua and personally I
felt that this was a really good event
because it&#39;s very rare especially in
Jakarta in Indonesia to have our leaders
engage in discussions in front of our
own people and even repaint alongside
them this summer I I got an internship
in Jakarta smart city in the andujar a
regional government and I was really
surprised to see that that internship
also linked to my contact was story
because I was after after my team
supervisor saw my how I was interested
in Kota tua
he connected me to Bop Edda which is the
Jakarta regional planning agency and so
vapid ah invited me to attend a workshop
a regional peer learning workshop on
Kotaku WA and that was the only high
school student in this event but to give
you contacts beside me to laugh and to
the right
there were there was a mayor of a city
in Philippines called vegan and also
some leader
from Frankfurt in Germany and also
guangzhou in china and this three day in
this three day event all these leaders
were all communicating different
solutions that work in their historical
cities which could be implemented in
kota tua and it was really exciting for
me in the but the main takeaway that I
got from this event is I I finally got
to see the progress that was made inside
Kota tua from the inside out and I was
really pleased to see how and oh I
forgot to mention that in front of me at
that time was the head of pop Edna
herself EBU tutti and after and this was
on the first day she was talking about
the current progress in Kota tua and
after her session I there was a
question-and-answer session and I
followed up with and I told her of my
dreams and my end of the corridor
project and by the end of my my comment
she was really surprised not just
because I was a high school student but
also because I dared to tell her about
my ideas and opinions of kota tua
and at the end she invited me to be a
part of the papaya that team that deals
with caught that wa and of course i
couldn&#39;t say no to that opportunity but
this event in this event we there were a
lot of historical cities who shared with
us their progress and this this was a
lady from the city of Essen in germany
she and she was part of the UNESCO
committee and so she shared to us how
caught up wat can be a UNESCO World
Heritage Site but if there&#39;s one thing
that I want everyone here to take away
from my presentation today I would I
would say that it&#39;s it&#39;s it has been an
honor to work in co-taught WA but it&#39;s
also rather surprising for me because
especially in Indonesia as a young as a
young person I&#39;ve always thought that
those who deal with politics and
development engine
it&#39;s it&#39;s like a grown-up conversation
even in Kadapa I used to think that I
could not make any difference in Co that
after all and there are already a lot of
experts archaeologists historians even
economists who who actually have the
final say on Cadabra but my perception
was really wrong at the end because I
got to convey my lot of my ideas to the
different leaders in Coweta and so I
think it&#39;s really important for us to
use this experience to show how how
there is no in a way there&#39;s no barriers
between in different areas that we&#39;re
interested in I myself I&#39;m interested in
politics and I&#39;ve always thought that
experts would rule politics like
politicians and economists but in the
way we and and I I guess we have we all
have that perception I mean who am are
we we are just citizens what part do we
have in the growth of our of our
Indonesian society but in a way once we
there&#39;s there&#39;s no there&#39;s no boundaries
and we shouldn&#39;t think with these
boundaries in mind at the end we have to
rethink cultural development we have to
rethink public policy and we have to
rethink politics in general because I
thought that the answer with revitalize
a revitalizing or that well
lied with experts but in the way I was
wrong in order to revitalize core that
war we need environmentalists
politicians but also artists and actress
actors and actresses and even visitors
like you and me and even ice tea sellers
and hotel obvious to start engaging with
the discussions on how co-taught hua can
be revitalized and that I believe
applies to any different field that you
you are in whether that&#39;s in business or
in the creative industry no matter your
background you always have your idea can
always be beneficial to your
if you if you try to make it beneficial
so thank you very much for listening to
my speech you can just
