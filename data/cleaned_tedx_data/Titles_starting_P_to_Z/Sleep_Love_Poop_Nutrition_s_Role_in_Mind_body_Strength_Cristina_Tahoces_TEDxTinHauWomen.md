look at these women they&#39;re all at
different stages in their life and they
all have different goals and ambitions
they want to fulfill which one are you
today which one do you relate to are you
the teenager just discovering her
potential
are you the career woman crashing
through that glass ceiling or are you
the woman who wants to reconnect and
rediscover her spark now what do all
these women have to do to reach their
goals what do they all have in common
well they all need to sleep love and
poop sleep love poop is about using food
as a tool to get what you want and to
reach your goals
some days all you might want to do is
just make it through the day but on
other days you might have more specific
goals to do really well in that exam to
rock that presentation to run that 10k
but no matter what your goal is be it
big or small make no mistake you must
eat with the purpose to sleep love and
poop we all know that getting enough
sleep is crucial when we don&#39;t get
enough our physical and our mental
resilience start to suffer and if you&#39;re
one of the millions of people who
struggle with sleep no doubt you&#39;ve had
the following advice turn your bedroom
into a sanctuary take a lavender scented
bath and whatever you do do not bring
the iPhone or the iPad into the bedroom
right that&#39;s a killer well this picture
here basically summarizes why my bedroom
will never be a sanctuary I gave up that
privilege nine years ago when
had kids and with all of us here many of
us here anyway
suffering from these interruptions in
the middle of the night and all of the
stress and anxiety that we suffered
during the day we just can&#39;t afford to
wait an hour or two before bedtime and
to initiate a sleep strategy it&#39;s far
too late by then if we&#39;re gonna reach
our goals we need to start planning to
sleep from the moment we wake up and a
key part of that strategy is giving our
mind and our body the fuel it needs in
order to cope with all of that stress
and anxiety and the interruptions that
come back to haunt us at night now which
one of these two meals is going to give
us the building blocks that we need to
face our day like the rockstars we are
and then let it all go and sleep like a
baby well many of you have probably
guessed that it&#39;s this one right but why
well eggs not only are they a form of
protein that helps you create energy but
they&#39;re really rich in B vitamins and B
vitamins are magic for stress management
a simple deficiency in B vitamins can be
the reason why you can&#39;t shut your mind
off and get to sleep because we need B
vitamins like b5 and b6 to calm our
nerves and make melatonin the hormone
that regulates her sleep cycle the
avocado in this dish or the smashed
avocado as you see it in this picture is
rich in magnesium a key mineral that&#39;s
often deficient in people with
stress-related sleep disorders in fact a
clinical trial on elderly people
suffering from insomnia showed that
magnesium supplementation actually
helped them get to sleep faster stay
asleep longer and it helped to regulate
their stress hormones as well and the
tomato in this dish is magic it is full
of the antioxidant vitamin C and
research shows that people who have high
levels of vitamin C in their blood
react to stress a lot more positively
than people with low levels of vitamin C
not just that they&#39;re able to bounce
back from stressful situations a lot
faster than people with low levels of
vitamin C in their blood and that that
is magic in today&#39;s world where we can&#39;t
sleep because we&#39;re wired we&#39;re wired
because we&#39;re constantly jumping from
one stressful situation to another if
we&#39;re gonna reach our goals we need to
eat with purpose we need to eat to
perform we can only reach our goals and
get what we want when we eat to sleep I
have been blogging and preaching and
using sleep love coop as a tool to help
my clients for some time now and I can&#39;t
tell you how often I miss quoted by
people who think it&#39;s sleep eat poop or
eat sleep poop or I don&#39;t know something
to do with eat anyway but it&#39;s not eat
it&#39;s love and it&#39;s love because even
though I&#39;m a nutritionist I&#39;m not in the
business of getting anyone to eat no one
needs any help with that I am in the
business of getting you to love how you
feel because self-love builds confidence
and belief in our own self words and
with that ladies with that we can do
anything with that we can reach our
goals this was me nine years ago after I
had my first child he&#39;s sitting here
today the beautiful lady beside me in
the picture that&#39;s my mom in the time
that this picture was taken I would look
in the mirror and I would send myself
silent hate messages what&#39;s happened to
you Christina you&#39;re so fat you&#39;re so
ugly and your belly button is a crater
apart from all of the negative self-talk
I was also chronically sick every month
I had a sinus infection and I started
getting allergies to things I&#39;ve never
been allergic to before my body it
wasn&#39;t just overweight I really felt
like I was falling apart so much so that
when my maternity leave came to an end
so did my banking career that that was a
real low point in my life and how did I
deal with it well by eating copious
amounts of chocolate of course right
that&#39;s some people deal with things um
but does eating a lot of chocolate does
that even make sense when you already
feel ugly and defeated of course not but
eating eating&#39;s never been about logic
it&#39;s about emotion
and the problem is that when we are
stressed and we&#39;re down in the dumps
this is how we eat we turn to the
chocolate the biscuits the packaged
goods the takeout food all of this food
is what I call dead food and you know
what it actually doesn&#39;t matter whether
the package says organic gluten free
sugar free I don&#39;t even care if you pay
20 US dollars for that organic granola
with goji berries from the Amazon it is
still dead and the thing is that when we
are trying to lose weight or when we&#39;re
trying to reach a health and wellness
goal what do we do we start taking
things out of our diet right how many of
you have ever said this
I quit sugar that&#39;s it no more chocolate
no more biscuits nor cake nothing it&#39;s
all over right well here&#39;s the thing
every time I denied myself that piece of
chocolate it was a silent reminder to
myself of how ugly and undeserving I
felt
don&#39;t eat the chocolate don&#39;t eat this
don&#39;t eat that it&#39;s gonna make you
fatter sicker uglier no no no bad bad
bad and no love no love until one day I
realized who cares if I didn&#39;t eat that
stupid piece of chocolate I also sure as
hell wasn&#39;t having a single piece of
fruit or anything that approximated the
six to eight cups of vegetables we
should all be having on a daily basis
six to eight cups and eventually I
started to eat more fresh fruits and
vegetables and incorporate healthy fats
like nuts and seeds and avocado into my
diet I put the dead food behind me and
eventually eventually this happened I
started to associate live nutrient-dense
foods as a reward and today my mantra is
don&#39;t give it up girlfriend trade up we
are so used to applying this mantra in
every other aspect of our life is this
the best phone I can have is this best
University I can go to is this the best
job I can get is this the best boyfriend
I can have but we are not used to
thinking about our food this way so can
you can you trade up and have a
delicious chocolate avocado pudding
that&#39;s gonna increase your energy levels
and help you reach your goals instead of
a dead piece of chocolate that frankly
is neither here nor there if your goal
for the day is to ward off that cold
because you want to go dancing with your
girlfriends on Saturday night trade up
and have some raspberries and nuts if
your goal for the day is to get to the
gym because you haven&#39;t been in ages
trade up and have some carrots and
hummus I promise you it&#39;s
this food and not the dead organic
gluten-free power bar that&#39;s gonna make
you feel alive from the inside out but I
feel I have to warn you about something
eating with love can create
off-the-chart energy levels and you
might even end up doing something crazy
and spontaneous like having sex on a
weeknight so don&#39;t just eat eat ooh love
to love the life you live and the
challenges it throws at you today my
chronic sinusitis and my allergies are
gone I stand next to my children instead
of hiding behind them to take a picture
and I&#39;m teaching my girls that love love
doesn&#39;t look like a heart-shaped box of
chocolates
it looks like guacamole because one day
their goal is gonna be to survive their
first heartbreak and I have this crazy
dream that they&#39;re gonna drown their
sorrows not an ice cream regarded but in
a bow mash and veggie sticks because
that&#39;s what&#39;s gonna make them resilient
and they&#39;re gonna know that&#39;s what&#39;s
gonna make them resilient in mind in
heart and embody so we have talked about
sleep and love and how they can help you
reach your goals but what about poop
well poop is power our poop determines
how healthy we are 70 to 80% of our
immune cells reside in our gut so if you
are constantly getting sick if you are
having chronic viral or yeast infections
if you have unexplained bouts of
diarrhea your poop is controlling you
your poop is limiting you your poop also
determines how happy you are because 90%
90% of our serotonin our happy
is made in our gut in fact a clinical
trial published in 2015 showed that the
bacteria that resides in our gut is
actually responsible for regulating
serotonin production I want to hear
something even crazier our poop
determines our food cravings back in the
day when I was trying to beat my sugar
addiction I was constantly berate myself
Christina why didn&#39;t you just ignore
that little voice in your head try to
think look at the chocolate why are you
so weak minded well as it turns out the
sugar Beast doesn&#39;t live in our head it
lives in our gut technically speaking
the sugar beast is a yeast overgrowth
which like all yeast thrives on sugar in
all of its forms carbs like pasta and
bread sweets like chocolate NES my
friends even alcohol so what can we do
to show our poop who&#39;s the boss right
what can we do to put you back in charge
of your health your happiness and your
food choices well we can start by making
all of our meals poop tastic ok so add
fiber to everything add veggies to
everything I even use zucchinis in my
meat a zucchini my meatballs if you&#39;re
an oatmeal person in the morning add
chia seeds flax meal raspberries and
papaya all of this extra fiber is gonna
give you those sexy smooth moves and to
help you detoxify daily we also need to
start drinking with purpose we need to
set aside the coffees and the sodas and
fill our tank with water
dehydration is the number one root cause
of many digestive upsets including
excess gas bloating and constipation so
don&#39;t let your poop sabotage your goals
make food choices that put you and that
give you and not your poop the power
today all of us here have a really
powerful privilege and that is
village of choice we can make impactful
choices about how we want to live our
life and what we want to do some days
all you might want to do is breathe it
in but on others you will be called to
perform to dream big to want more what
do you want what are your goals I want
to own a resilient mind and body that
has guts and soul I want to thrive and
not just survive so I eat I eat with
purpose I eat to sleep love and poop and
today I&#39;m asking you to exercise your
privilege and choose to sleep love poop
right along with me thank you
[Applause]
