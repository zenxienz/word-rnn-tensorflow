good afternoon to you I feel like a bit
of a fraud I&#39;ve turned up right at the
end can I say thank you very much Andy
for the invitation I want to say a
little bit really about the journey I&#39;ve
taken I understand the concept today&#39;s
bridges and I want to talk about that in
some detail if I will and so you&#39;re
absolutely right I&#39;ve had a checkered
career I&#39;ve prosecuted or supervised the
prosecution of about a million cases
during 25 years and some of them are
high-profile many of them are not I want
to make the point just because you&#39;re
high-profile doesn&#39;t mean that you get
it you don&#39;t get the justice it&#39;s about
fear no fear no favor whoever you are
ultimately if you commit a crime which
we brought to justice now I thought
about whether it should be a red
property or a white puppy and my son
said to me well dad they&#39;re the same
thing
just different color and he then said
just like you and Tom Cruise I thought
that was a no no my son he&#39;s pissed
taker and undoubtedly what he said but
the reality is that we took my men and
women for example with the same thing
with different genders and one of the
things that I&#39;ve been conscious of over
the years is that men exert their power
because we can&#39;t share it it&#39;s as simple
as that you know there is no solution
ladies and gentlemen we&#39;re men aren&#39;t
the problem and there is no community
there is no community where women and
girls are safe it&#39;s a fact I&#39;ve come
across cases from everywhere everywhere
and you think about the 50 shades of
violence against women and girls you
think about feticide infanticide child
and early marriage you talk about FGM
you talk about sexual abuse then you
talk about forced marriage and then you
have domestic abuse and sexual offenses
and rape and financial abuse you have
homicide and suicide I mean we often
know the figure don&#39;t we that to women
of a week are killed in this country in
domestic abuse situations domestic
violence the one that people perhaps
don&#39;t know is that ten women kill
themselves every week because of
domestic abuse in this country and that
tells me something about what we should
be doing differently now from my
perspective the answer is very simple
you&#39;ve got to challenge those kinds of
behaviors and one of things I want your
help with this gentleman is to be the
bridge between the men who want to make
a difference to the women who are making
a difference in my experience of the 20
odd years of prosecuting and more
recently the women are already making
the difference they&#39;re already making
phenomenal achievements they are
succeeding in ways that you couldn&#39;t
possibly imagine but they often don&#39;t
have access and that&#39;s where I&#39;ve been
able to be a bridge it&#39;s not something I
chose to be it&#39;s something I wanted to
be I remember back in 2004-2005 I
organized the first conference on a
national national conference on forced
marriage and like many conferences I
would hold the conference then walk away
let somebody else do the business but
women&#39;s groups came up to me afterwards
and said in this here we&#39;ve got no men
speaking about this subject
we&#39;ve got no men with access to
legislation or to Parliament or to
ministers and the like and so I said
well tell me all about it
and they said well surely you know cuz
you&#39;re brown you know ladies and
gentlemen I&#39;d be married three times to
my great shirt
my first wife is Catholic my second was
Hindu my third was Sikh I&#39;ve done my bit
for multi faith engagement but I&#39;ve
never been forced into marriage I&#39;ve
never been forced into marriage and so I
had to learn and they taught me
everything I knew and then I said well
I&#39;ll take that I will take that to this
state and I managed made sure that they
were working group set up we legislated
we&#39;ve created forced marriage Civil
Protection forced marriage
criminalization we have done everything
we possibly can and we need to do more
undoubtedly but we&#39;re in a position now
where the American State Department
until last year had me as their advisor
something called Trump came along I
don&#39;t know what happened length I&#39;m not
allowed to go to America anymore I think
but they say for the Americans to say
that we were better than them and
something is something and that was a
journey that was undertaken by NGOs with
my help and support no more no less it
was their ideas and then there was a
modern slavery you probably don&#39;t know
this case it&#39;s a little-known case but
one that was impactful a woman there was
a family called the Asha family in
Manchester of all places and they had in
their care Karen from wrong word a 19
year old girl who was counterfeiting
t-shirts for them that was their
business that&#39;s what they did it they
counterfeit t-shirts but she was brought
in this country age of 10 and she did
not have a British passport she could
not speak
she had severe learning difficulties and
she couldn&#39;t hear properly Trading
Standards found her in the premises and
said naziha what could we do about this
and I said we&#39;ll prosecute is we will
make sure we prosecute it took us two
years to teach a sign language in order
for her to give evidence you probably
don&#39;t know this of everybody are
prosecuted she was cross-examined for 40
days because we could only ask her or
they could only ask her six questions a
day we put some rules in she was they
were convicted that whole family were
convicted of the abuse of her and
consequently legend German we
confiscated their property she is now at
university she now has a home and
they&#39;re in prison
it&#39;s her journey that we&#39;d talk about
the victims journey the victim
throughout my experience has a journey
that we will never understand unless we
really make the point of understanding I
think in recent weeks we&#39;ve been hearing
about the victims journey haven&#39;t we
hmm we&#39;ve been learning about how Oh
surely this has something but then we
men make it impossible to do sir
we put structures in place that make it
impossible for them to do so forgive me
I work off the water please I told my
wife I&#39;ve got pneumonia this morning by
the way it&#39;s well it&#39;s what men do
generally look one of the things that
struck me is that unless you follow the
journey you have no idea where they&#39;re
going and this is what you&#39;ve been
talking about in terms of bridges
there&#39;s no point building a bridge if
you don&#39;t know the journey the victim is
taking so perhaps people remember me
most for the the three girls the Lord
still groom in case now an actor played
me a very handsome actor but played me
my wife has a picture of the axle on the
wall there my where my picture used to
be I&#39;m I&#39;m not hurt but that case was
symbolic of where we were as a landscape
and where we were culturally we were
saying to victims
we don&#39;t hear you we don&#39;t want to
listen to you we don&#39;t believe you and
the fact that they came from very
chaotic and troubled backgrounds meant
that we had an excuse the reality is a
predator was picking on them because
they thought we wouldn&#39;t listen to them
so we were doubly damning them we were
not supporting them we were not giving
him a hope and again in the many many
senses I was a bridge I&#39;m you know there
were normal women women working trying
to protect these women these girls and
give them support but the only day they
were not getting justice and so as you
will know from the film I reverse the
decision not to prosecute I took this
case on and I made sure that those men
were convicted and those women got
justice and they are women and they are
they were male being young people forget
there were there were girls you know 13
14 year old girls
what would they know about relationships
what do they know about relationships
what they do know is that there&#39;s a
predator I
that predator will pick on them wherever
they go now that journey where people
were saying no to them where people are
ignoring them where people are not
listen to them is one that we had to
deal with and so this is where we
started dealing with it so we now have a
situation when I left the CPS
prosecution service in 2015 we had the
highest conviction rate for trial sexual
abuse in our history that&#39;s not me
that&#39;s people understanding and
beginning to understand that these young
girls needed support now what happened
to me is a little-known fact
now what do you think happened to me I
was lauded I was a hero
no the far right came for me they said
and this is I think I noticed yesterday
Collins have said that fake news is a
new word they created a website saying
that I was the one that didn&#39;t prosecute
kill these guys and these from the far
right then came from me in a big way I
had an English defensive demonstration
outside of my home I had a panic alarm
in my house my children had to go to
school by taxi you know I had 17,000
emails on one day calling for me to be
sacked and deported I was born in
Birmingham I don&#39;t want to go back
but but I wasn&#39;t gonna allow them to
stop me I got some phenomenal support
from women&#39;s groups and the like who
said Nazir we&#39;re gonna stand by you and
support you
and they helped me through that period
as did my staff as did my teams now I&#39;m
conscious of the fact that this is
something you can&#39;t do alone this is
something we all have to do together and
in order to walk across that bridge as
as that young girl did in the Asha case
as those victims did in the Rossdale
case as many others have done they had
to trust me and I had to open myself up
to them and say trust me but never let
them down one things that people who say
your expectations you&#39;ve got to meet
their expectations you&#39;ve got to give
them 24 hours a day seven days a week
and the answer is gentleman is education
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard it through in the
day there&#39;s no point doing relationship
education with their twelve or sixteen
you know that is too late
five six that&#39;s when you talk to them
about human rights that&#39;s when you talk
to them about women&#39;s rights that&#39;s
where you talked about relationships and
to my mind the answer is there two final
stories the Stuart horror prosecution
one women one woman out of 14 didn&#39;t get
justice she said to me and when I went
to her crying my eyes out thinking how
do I explain this to her how I said to
her I don&#39;t know I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t give
you closure she said to me you gave me
closure the moment that you believe me
that&#39;s the answer believing her and my
journey along this bridge started 20
years ago when a woman I ran into it of
an event showed me her wedding ring was
not on this finger but on the opposite
hand and I said to her why are you
wearing your wedding ring on the wrong
finger and she said it&#39;s because they
forced me to marry the wrong man and I
thought for a second I giggled actually
sadly I thought for a second hang limit
that&#39;s a life of hopelessness a life of
despair a life of daily rape of child
protection issues a horrific life yet
that is her protest because she didn&#39;t
have a voice and I made it my
responsibility as I know it is yours to
be her voice thank you very much
you
