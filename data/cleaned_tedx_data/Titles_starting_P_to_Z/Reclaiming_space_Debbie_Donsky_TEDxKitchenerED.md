I didn&#39;t trip okay so I formally studied
equity in my graduate work and each time
I&#39;d enter into one of these spaces I
felt like they expected us to introduce
ourselves by how we were most
marginalized I&#39;d introduce myself and I
would say I was Jewish and although I&#39;ve
experienced discrimination as a function
of that identity ironically in one of
these equity courses for me being Jewish
was about community and belonging what
drew me to equity work was something
different it was something visceral and
embodied I knew what it was but I was
afraid to speak it then a few years ago
as part of a team that was writing an
anti-oppression course for our board and
there they were again the dreaded
introductions I don&#39;t know what came
over me that day but I decided to speak
my truth hi my name is Debbie I knew
they expected me all to say that I was a
Jew but I didn&#39;t I said it I outed
myself and I said to everyone in the
room I come to this work because I&#39;ve
always felt marginalized for being fat
they laughed at me my face went red and
it was at that point that I made the
commitment for people to see and
understand the experiences of fat
shaming body shaming and discrimination
experienced by fat people every day when
I was nine years old it was the
International Year of the child I went
to a day camp and to celebrate the year
each of the cabins had to dress up as
people from different countries and my
cabin got Spain half the girls had to
dress up as boys and I desperately did
not want to be one I wanted to be one of
those pretty little girls that got to
our flowers in their hair and scarves
around their waist like flamenco dancers
but I was bigger in height and width
than all the other children and
invariably despite my begging they made
me be a man
my counselor taped a piece of black
crepe paper to my face I hated it I
hated that I was big I hated that I had
to be a man and the tears started
flowing and as the tears flowed they hit
the crepe paper so now not only did I
have a big black mustache
I had a big black frank zappa handlebar
moustache that went down my lips onto my
chin and down my neck and it was
permanently on my face for the rest of
the day I know right so then in sixth
grade we went on an exchange to Quebec
this is another good one so the plan was
that we were going to be billeted with
families and we had to fill out these
profiles to explain our likes and
dislikes it was like a dating service
and the teachers then had to make a
decision about who would be our partners
so the day came when everybody got their
profiles except for me the teacher pulls
me aside and she says now Debbie we were
gonna place you with one girl but then
we realized she probably wasn&#39;t placed
with the right person because that girl
is not known for being kind so we
thought since you were both overweight
you would be better suited to one
another so you will be now partners okay
so in eighth grade we did the 12-minute
rhymin now I know you probably find this
surprising but I was not the best runner
in fact I was literally the worst runner
the teacher would call out to everyone
in cost and say the runs over Debbie
just arrived and you&#39;re right so I don&#39;t
actually remember my classmates making
fun of me but I remember the teacher I
remembers we would do our neighborhood
runs how she would drive through the
neighborhood in her car and scream at us
from her window saying hurry up and go
faster and I&#39;d wonder if she recognized
the hypocrisy of this while she was
sitting in her air-conditioned car while
my legs were
chafing and my lungs are on fire
anyway so back to the run this time was
gonna be different I asked a girlfriend
of mine who was a great runner if she
would help me and every day after school
we practiced for three weeks the day of
the run I was ready I did not expect
miracles but I did expect better
performance one of my girlfriends Beth
my tanco who is right there
had to count my laps so as I ran around
in circles she would scream words of
encouragement at me like keep going and
you&#39;re doing great and when the run was
over I was red-faced and tired but proud
we had to line up and give our teacher
the numbers and so I stood in line and I
was excited so excited to tell her and I
told her my numbers and in front of
everyone she said there&#39;s no way you did
not many laps do it again on the second
round
so I&#39;m bent over you know those running
cramps that you got and I&#39;m ready face
do it again I&#39;m exhausted
she said then do it again at 4 o&#39;clock I
told her that I wasn&#39;t lying Beth told
her that the count was accurate but she
was still convinced that we were both
lying and when I look back I wonder how
did it serve her to say that we were
lying so me the well-behaved you can
always count on me student changed
forever in that moment and I looked up
at the teacher and in front of everyone
in class I told her to f off
except I actually said the word but I&#39;m
not allowed to say it on the stage
because there&#39;s students in the room
anyway you can guess what happened next
she yelled at me she sent me to the
office I made my way to the change room
trying to take off my sweaty gym clothes
but they were sticking to me and I gave
up and I just sat down in a pool of my
own tears but it was more than tears it
was shame it was humiliation it was
frustration it was complete and utter
resignation that no effort I ever made
was going to make a difference some time
later the principal walked into the
change room she told me to wash up and
take my time and then come have a chat
with her in the office she was an
incredibly kind woman and when I think
back I think that part of her empathy
stem for the fact that she had survived
polio as a young girl and understood
what it was like to live with physical
challenges so this is actually her this
is actually funny this is her autograph
to me at the end of grade 8 after I said
that word to the teacher Debbie
congratulations on your great year have
a wonderful summer so I made my way to
the office and there she was sitting at
her desk with my student record in front
of her up until then I had no idea that
these things existed now as a principal
I know what those heavily-used student
records look like they are thick with
documentation hundreds of pages bursting
out of it corners are curled mine was
flat thin and untied she said to me by
the look of your student record it does
not appear that you have been in the
office very often of course I have been
but I&#39;ve been helping the secretaries
and delivering news letters
she asked me what happened I told her I
swore at the teacher and the angry tears
started again she said I lied I didn&#39;t
lie I tried so hard I told her I was
gonna drop phys ed she said I actually
couldn&#39;t because you needed it to
graduate high school she told me then
that Patti&#39;s gonna like this one she
told me then that it was actually really
good for mental health and well-being
and had a profound impact on academic
success this is like early eighties she
was well ahead of her time she then told
me that I shouldn&#39;t have sworn at the
teacher but she understood my anger
she called my mom hello mrs. Donsky I
have Debbie in the office yeah she&#39;s
fine she&#39;s had a bit of a rough day
wondering if you might want to come pick
her up maybe take her out shopping to
cheer her up
I should have known I wasn&#39;t in trouble
at that point my mom was at the school
within minutes we got in the car and
started to drive home and the tears
started again she wanted to go back into
the school my mother is always the
protector and I begged her not to I did
not want to set foot back in that space
the shame was palpable when I returned
to the school in ninth grade that
teacher was gone I took for that in
grade 9 but dropped it as soon as I
could and I gained more than 50 pounds
by the time high school was over as I
remind my mother of this story now a
tiny woman who probably doesn&#39;t weigh a
hundred pounds she&#39;s brought back to her
own trauma as a chubby little girl and
she tells me this story which I&#39;ve heard
at least a hundred times of at the time
that her teacher told her to read the
walrus&#39;s portion of the walrus and the
carpenter&#39; poem by Lewis Carroll because
she was fat as a walrus
while her classmates laughed along with
the teacher the fact that my mother is
petite now is irrelevant
we do not
what we are I remember the first time my
daughter Rachel thought that there was
something wrong with her body I taken
her swimming with a bunch of kids from
the neighborhood and she had this big
news to share of course she didn&#39;t tell
me about it
had I known I would have done anything
to try to dissuade her from sharing this
story to avoid the impending shame so we
get to the pool and she announces to all
her friends guess what I weigh 80 pounds
and I don&#39;t have to sit in a booster and
I can even sit in the front seat of the
car I didn&#39;t know what she thinks I was
40 feet away but she said something a
few of the girls giggled and then one
girl spoke and then I saw it the look of
shame humiliation brokenhearted
shoulders slumped head down I asked her
afterwards what happened and she told me
what she said and that the older girl
said it I weighed 30 pounds less than
you this is the first time Rach
experienced insecurity as a result of
somebody&#39;s opinion about her weight up
until then she saw it as a thing of
pride she was growing she was big she
was strong you know it&#39;s ironic that
while we&#39;re told as fat people that we
take up far too much space we are also
not seen we are looked past and we are
not considered Lindy West an
unapologetic fat woman social rights
activist and writer tells us that being
fat is seen as a constant state of
failure and that we all silently agree
that one day this fat person won&#39;t be
fat so it&#39;s better not to speak about it
because it&#39;s shameful and impolite to do
so her response to this was to come out
as a fat person and claimed that
identity you know each time people would
say to me what you&#39;re talk about I&#39;d say
fat and I&#39;d wait for that sort of
shocked look and they talked their head
and they&#39;d have nothing to say or you
know the people who love me but say oh
Debbie you have to stop saying that but
the thing is I can&#39;t stop saying it it&#39;s
Who I am
it&#39;s how I see myself and it&#39;s the part
of me that I have to negotiate in all
settings
lately I&#39;ve taken to drawing images of
fat women in unlikely spaces the sensual
woman the woman comfortable in her
nakedness the yogi and my personal
favorite the ballerina as my pencil
embraces each line each fold each role
it does so in the most loving way and I
can see these women in their beauty
their strength and if you can imagine
their grace Newbern Abram tells us that
empathy is the antidote to shame
I thought losing weight was the antidote
I thought that if I lost weight
everything I wanted would come true I
would become the person I was meant to
be but the thing is these experiences
have made me the person I&#39;m meant to be
an advocate empathetic an educator who
believes in each person&#39;s possibility
and not their limits someone who is
going to fight from not only my own
acceptance but for an equitable school
system that is the foundation of an
equitable Society you know there are so
many moments of insidious traumas or
microaggressions where we come to
internalize the things that people say
about us we are lazy
we are gluttonous we are sloppy we are
fat we are stupid we internalize these
comments as children do you remember a
time when you just were before
somebody&#39;s comments were stuck in your
head telling you that you weren&#39;t enough
like Rachel before the car seat my mom
before the walrus and the carpenter&#39;
army before a teacher told me that being
fat erased any other aspect of who or
what I was we hate to disrupt those
spaces those voices those limits and
know that not only do we have a right to
be here but we have a right to be here
out loud and in-your-face without
apology
and as we reclaim those spaces we make
the commitment to not make assumptions
about somebody&#39;s likes dislikes
abilities or personality because of the
body that holds them but to see them as
whole people with aspirations and
impossible dreams for which they no
longer need to ask permission to pursue
thank you
