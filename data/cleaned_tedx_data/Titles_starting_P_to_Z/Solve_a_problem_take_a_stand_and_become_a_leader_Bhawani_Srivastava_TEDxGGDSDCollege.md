yes before I present anything else
completely yourself a leader your hands
it&#39;s very very ask this question it is
so Lisa no no too fast young Lisa hands
because we have meet the title of leader
something which is much bigger than us
something which is beyond us within the
leadership has a title that&#39;s that&#39;s
something that we will reserve one day
in life leadership and banner our
something&#39;s are our attitude phrases
what leadership is the most desire
Vangelis in my career I have seen the
leaf statistic term in business selling
a vanilla and yet these two topics these
two these two phrases these two things
are so closely independent with each
other that one doesn&#39;t exist we talked
about and I need you to do something
including my esteemed speakers and and
the college faculties here and and and
my friends sitting in the audience I
want you you would see two teams in
white and in black t-shirts your task is
to count the number of passes made by
the team in white t-shirt I repeat again
it&#39;s a 30-second video there are two
teams one and white one in black and
your task and they are passing two balls
amongst each other
your task is to count the number of
passes made by the people in the white
shirt are we ready for it all right I&#39;m
going to play it now three two one you
have to be extremely focused on that
because in between the passes are going
to go fast and this is so phenomenal
that you will see something very
interesting
what is the difference between the male
and the female mind when it comes to the
attention things so the result of this
is really interesting count the number
of passes made by the people in the
white shirt
all right how many passes 14 15 16 as
well all right so really doesn&#39;t matter
what matters is has did anybody notice
anything strange in the video how many
of you yeah so that&#39;s about 5% of the
people here right now this time I&#39;m
going to play the video again watch the
30 second video and this time do not
count
just watch guys can you replay the with
you do not count just look at it
how did you miss the gorilla so this is
probably the smallest form of mentalism
that can happen I took away your brains
to counting and then I showed in a
little eye I threw in a little bit of a
waiver for you saying that there&#39;s going
to be a difference between the male and
the female mind but but the important
part is do we all agree that looking is
not the same as see you were looking at
the video you were not seen them would
you have the establish the fact that
what we think about leadership and
leaders could be very different from
them
from the inherent qualities that we
actually respect or want to respect in a
leader do we agree to that could we be
wrong about our perceptions in terms of
what we blindly look at people do you
think is it possible that we have lists
the gorillas all this while yeah I&#39;m
going to request for my now with that
fact stablished then she inspire you
does he inspire you does he inspire you
does she inspire you does he inspire you
how strange isn&#39;t it when we think of
the title of a leader there are
essentially four things related to it
money power title and influence and yet
all the three people that you said yes
to probably had some of it none of it
isn&#39;t it and the two people who had the
most of it you said no this is the
gorilla that we are missing in
leadership is what we actually care
about in a leader is compassion somebody
who takes a chase stand somebody who
stands for you and most important
quality of a leader is somebody who&#39;s a
problem solver
what do leaders do for you he does do
one basic most important job and and I&#39;m
sure there are loads of definitions
there are gurus out there defining what
the leadership was and all about but
leaders do one very important and the
only thing that one one most important
thing that the leaders do is they solve
a problem it could be something as big
as what Nelson Mandela did like getting
a country free that was a problem or it
could be something more is much more
smaller now if this is the world of
leadership it&#39;s important to talk about
how do you achieve these little things
in the lives how do you become an
everyday leader I&#39;m going to answer a
little I&#39;m I&#39;m going to answer that how
far you from - will - from two stories
that went that are very close to my
heart today like I said if there is one
call to action for everyone from this
stop it is about go out there solve a
problem be a problem-solver leaders we
do not respect people who stand up and
dog we respect people who how to go out
there and solve a problem either for you
a community for the nation depends on
your area of influence but what what is
the most important part in a leader is
that they they solve a problem what we
saw earlier were huge global leaders
that we actually respect we saw that
very well-known faces I&#39;m not sure if
any of you have heard of heard of this
name mr. Robert sooty now mr. Robert
sooty grew up on the pavements of Mumbai
and he grew up watching his mother wake

up every day at 4:00 a.m. in the morning
going to the public table to fill
bottles he also witnessed people
fighting for every single drop of water
this had a lasting impression on mr.
sooty and today this 80 year old man who
lives in Miller Road in Bombay has a
foundation called drop dead foundation
now what he does is something very
absurd actually he every morning mr.
sooty goes up to every housing society
near his where he lives
he knocks the door and he asks them if
there is a leaking tap in the house if
the answer is no he moves on to the next
house if our answer is yes the tap is
fixed by a company member with him now
the interesting part
earlier women never used to entertain he
would go in the afternoons North Vidor
and then he realized that he and the
plum ball are two men knocking the doors
and of course the women were not
comfortable opening the road so now he
has a lady volunteer with him when they
go about knocking these doors and when
then he knocks things doors he there is
a lady along with him and they asked
again and if there is a leaking tap they
fix it again this me looked so
insignificant in somebody&#39;s eye you may
probably not even realize that who is
mr. Ravitz ooty when you see him
but you know what ladies and gentlemen
this gentleman has saved more than a
million liters of what over the last so
many years from from these trickling
taps that that he does he fit into your
regular spectrum of leadership that we
know is titled money power influence no
but he has solved problems taking the
stand he has all those four things that
he will actually raise your hands well
do you respect me tsunami people you are
living yes another moving story that I
want to share with you today is from the
auto Oilers in through 100 now auto
wireless in India especially the tier 2
tier 3 cities hanabi&#39;s until these two
friends were shown in the picture at the
back these two auto drivers used to
stand at a blue van through them they&#39;ll
be stationed or to stand and every day
almost every day as a part of their
routine they would go and they would see
passengers getting down from train and
asking them that which is the what is
the way to the hospital and these guys
would get so moved by the plight of
these poor people that they would take
them and drop them slowly this act of
kindness we know started building up
with other things like donating blood
you know arranging food medicines for
the sick and the people who would come
and ask them then just in patents and
the science of you know pro-social
kindness says for me that it has a by
and large very it has it has a ripple
effect on the people alone and slowly
over a period of some time there were 55
others auto drivers who joined these two
guys they pulled in money they put an
ambulance and in the last three years
the ambulance has done more than two
thousand trips from the railway station
of 301 aspirin to the hospital closest
and they do this all free of cost what
these guys want us to think about they
don&#39;t want us to think about that one
day then I will be rich I&#39;ll do
something for the poor they have they
have taken a stand and again I&#39;m going
to go back to the leadership traits that
we actually respect they have empathy
they have taken a stand they lead a
change and most importantly what are
they doing guys
solving a problem and this is the core
of leadership for me and what I value
the most
leadership is solved by creating value
and how do you create value for someone
you create value by only and only
solving a problem again if there is one
call to action for my side in this talk
it would be that please solve a problem
it could be a small problem around you
it could be a big problem around you it
could be school colleges working
professionals at your office you will
that the title of the leader is far more
it couldn&#39;t be more insignificant in
your life than what you think that it is
I think it&#39;s a powerful idea I think
it&#39;s a small idea as well but this is
something that I want you to share with
you thank you so much for letting me
share with you it has been an honor to
be here thank you
