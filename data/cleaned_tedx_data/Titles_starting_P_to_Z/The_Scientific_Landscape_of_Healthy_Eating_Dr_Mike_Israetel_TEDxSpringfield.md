hey guys thank you for having me today I
am apparently dr. Micah&#39;s hotel and I
will be talking to you about the
scientific landscape of healthy eating
all about healthy eating from a
scientific approach so just a little bit
of background I think understanding
healthy eating or talking about it is
pretty worthwhile because if you eat
healthy set supposed to increase not
only your lifespan but it improves your
quality of life as well so everything
gets better when you eat healthy and
it&#39;s a very common concern because
pretty much everybody knows that right
if you look at somebody&#39;s food and you
point at it they&#39;re gonna do one of two
things they can be repotted about how it
is they really uh-huh see ya or they
just start making excuses like well
today is well you know I&#39;ve been really
stressed then who knows don&#39;t judge me
right let&#39;s see the 1 of 2 everyone
knows that eating healthy is pretty
important unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of
contradicting advice on the internet and
all forms of media about what it is that
eating healthy is and a lot of that
advice is very ideologically based by
ideological mean that there is clear
moralistic right and wrong if you eat
some kinds of foods you&#39;re not just
unhealthy you&#39;re a bad person altogether
and if you eat some other foods you&#39;re
at home with the Angels so some of this
is helpful a lot of it&#39;s not really
helpful the way I got into this sort of
thing was that I have been an athlete my
entire life I wrestled for a long time
power lifter for a long time now I&#39;m a
bodybuilder and Brazilian jiu-jitsu
grappler you can tell by my funky ears
right and as I got bigger and stronger
more muscular I realized that the size
and all this hard training was probably
going to be costing my health somewhat I
wanted to minimize it by at least
understanding how to eat healthy and
then later as a professor teaching the
scientific basis of healthy eating I
really had to know my stuff so here I am
talking to you guys about it so of
course the closest way we can get to the
truth the path of the truth that is the
most likely is science I think we all
know that by now we just saw an awesome
video about the physical state of the
Internet no one&#39;s doubting science
anymore but when you talk to people
about the science of healthy eating a
lot of times they&#39;ll say things like
well you know I can go online and find a
study to support anything you think milk
is good I can find a study that says
milk is bad it&#39;s all up in the air but
unfortunately that&#39;s a misunderstanding
standing of how the scientific process
works it turns out that science works
based on the some of the evidence and
it&#39;s very difficult to do you have to
take all of the studies at the same time
and look at the net perspective that
they offer into what the structure of
healthy eating actually is because if
you just go one study at a time you can
just cherry-pick accidental studies
right studies have error rates and then
you find all kinds of things just aren&#39;t
true and then balance you could be
looking at the one percent of studies
and a field that say one thing whereas
ninety nine percent say something
completely different so if you look at
everything you end up with a ton of data
when my team and I wrote a book on this
very topic
we ended up pooling so much data
together to support our position and
learn that the size of the citations was
the exact size of the length of the book
itself so we just put it online because
it would&#39;ve been ridiculously a hundred
fifty page book and page 75 runs out of
stuff and just starts citations how how
many people read links for fun but we
had to put it somewhere else because
there&#39;s so much data but that&#39;s really
good because that means we know a lot
about healthy eating there is a lot of
consensus there and remember in science
there are no absolutes so the rest of
this presentation is presented in
likelihoods right it is a very good
probability that what I&#39;m going to say
is true but of course everything is
always to some extent at least up in the
air what does the landscape of healthy
eating look like according to science
well it&#39;s really kind of a pyramid not
the USDA food guide pyramid or said
apparently you have to eat breakfast
cereals at the bottom of the pyramid all
the time you guys remember that like
breads and cookies and rice and stuff
all the real food was somewhere else so
this pyramid is more scientific it&#39;s
more theoretical it says that some
features of healthy eating matter a
whole lot they&#39;re the base of the
pyramid other features matter a little
bit less and a little bit less and some
of them are just almost trivialities and
when people concern themselves too much
with those and not enough with the base
they make mistakes and healthy eating
right now we&#39;re gonna take a look
through all of the phases of this
pyramid together and try to make a
little bit of basic sense out of all
this so the first most important part of
healthy eating is calorie balance it is
by far the most important it has
probably around a 60% effect size
compared to everything else you can do
for your diet so if there&#39;s one most
important thing watching how much food
you eat is the most important thing for
your diet as far
your health because primarily body
weight is very impactful to health
having a healthy weight is the number
one thing that nutrition can offer you
to make you healthier it&#39;s not the only
but it&#39;s certainly the biggest healthy
weight it doesn&#39;t come in a perfect you
know just one number that you have to be
or else you&#39;re bad remember no
moralizing there&#39;s actually quite a
broad range over here so if I were
hypothetically 5&#39;4 which clearly I&#39;m at
least six feet tall so I don&#39;t even know
I picked that number you know I could
weigh anywhere between a hundred and
five and a hundred and seventy pounds
and be okay and not have to worry about
my way too much but the reality matter
is that in a lot of Western countries
the USA included a lot of us are above
those top and ranges and weight loss is
the most often prescribed and best idea
for a lot of individuals who are
struggling with their health from a
dietary perspective there have been some
individuals that say body weight is not
important that we should just focus on
the kinds of food we&#39;re eating I don&#39;t
think that is supported scientifically
calorie amounts the amount of food we
eat and our body weight is ignored at
our health peril it&#39;s very important to
be clear about that so okay we got the
calories down how much food you&#39;re
eating how much away matters for sure
matters a little less maybe about 20
percent is what kind of food composes
those calories that you eat the calorie
sources themselves it turns out that
there are a couple of groups of food
that are very good to eat for the
majority of your intake for example
fruits veggies and whole grains lean
proteins and healthy fats like avocado
and olive oil those foods should pretty
much be the preponderance of your intake
but it&#39;s not all or none it turns out
that if you get most of your diet
meaning about 75% from these healthy
sources you can have a little bit of
junk food on the side and I promise
you&#39;re not an evil person well maybe our
I just don&#39;t know you that well but has
nothing to do with your food right it
turns out that if you do most of your
healthy eating you could have a little
bit junk food and it&#39;s not a big deal
there&#39;s no reason to have these
all-or-none plans of cutting out junk
altogether you just have to eat a little
bit less of them next for about 10% of
the variants already a very small
component but an important one
our macronutrient amounts the Macan
traits are proteins carbs and fats and
it turns out that our body needs all of
these in a minimum amount but it turns
out it&#39;s only about 10% of calories so
if we add all those together we get 10%
protein 10% carbs 10% fats we have 70%
left of calories to fill in with any
macronutrients we want and that means
that as long as you get your minima
extremes in macronutrient intake are
totally fine and very much equivocal for
health what does that mean that means
that anytime someone says well carbs are
really bad for your health you can
simply point them to vegans who consume
up to 80% of the Dighton carbs and some
of the healthiest people in the world
individuals that follow the Paleo diet
eat lots of protein in fact more than
many recommend and our healthiest can be
even individuals involved in
bodybuilding right
they eat amounts of protein that seem
completely obscene and very little of
anything else and there&#39;s some of the
healthiest people in the world as well
and even and then they&#39;re saying this
and the 90s would have been pure
insanity high fat diets that are low in
carbs and low in protein are very much
vetted as super healthy via direct
scientific investigation as long as you
get your calories right and you make
sure most of that food is from healthy
source what about nutrient timing how
many of you guys have ever heard not to
eat past a certain time at night or else
and who knows that that or else&#39;s and
crazy elves come and get you that&#39;s
always what I thought it was I try take
out a couple elves I ate late at night I
kept waiting for them to show up but
nothing ever happened so it turns out
that nutrient timing is a little bit
overrated people seem to think there&#39;s
some kind of magic formula but they&#39;ve
studied alternate daily fasting where
they literally you don&#39;t eat for a day
and then the next day you don&#39;t eat for
a day and people would think how many of
you guys just intuitively raise your
hands do you think that like just feels
like not a good idea like that&#39;s not
healthy right that seems crazy and
they&#39;ve studied up to eight meals a day
which a lot of us think oh man you see
someone who eats a you take meals a day
and you&#39;re like that must be the
healthiest person of all time that&#39;s
sheer dedication it turns out both offer
their health benefits and trade-offs on
the net balance alternate daily fasting
is just about as healthy it even has
some unique health benefits compared to
eight meals a day or something like that
there&#39;s a wide range of meals that are
totally cool to eat nutrient timing by
itself accounts for roughly 5 percent of
the variance and health most
of it coming down to that little tip
right there if you eat about three to
six times a day for most people you get
all the nutrients you need and you
supply your body with energy how do you
guys think it feels to take a call from

your boss at 5:00 p.m.
saying you have another project stay
late at work when it&#39;s one of your
alternate daily fasting days and you
haven&#39;t eaten all day
right you pick up fella who&#39;s this I&#39;m
your boss I don&#39;t have a boss man I just
need a nap let me call you back tomorrow
when I have food right that&#39;s a little
bit weird so usually three to six meals
is best fit to your own personal
schedule and your own lifestyle goals
next we come into the last five percent
tip top of the pyramid not accounting
for a lot of the variance in Health
contrary to a lot of popular opinion our
hydration and supplements here&#39;s the
good news about hydration it&#39;s largely
self-regulating over millions of years
of evolution all organisms have pretty
much figured out that when they get
dehydrated there&#39;s a thirst response and
it works incredibly well it doesn&#39;t work
well in a couple quirky scenarios like
if you&#39;re sweating a ton in sport your
thirst actually lags behind your
hydration enough not to ever endanger
you but usually to make you too
dehydrated to perform at your best but
for just walking around daily living
your thirst does a good job of telling
you in a drink so you don&#39;t have to slam
water preemptively right that&#39;s actually
myth in the early 2000s everyone had
Nalgene bottles running around and if
you stopped drinking water for a second
that&#39;s it you were done right it turns
out that&#39;s really not the case right
some more sort of bad news I guess a lot
of supplements most supplements almost
all supplements are unfortunately
ineffective at their claim goals yes
that means if you go to any popular
nutrition store you can walk across the
walls and point to stuff and if you
point to it and asked grandfather
science or something like that me really
if I was to walk in with you right what
does this do what does that do what does
that do the answer is generally pretty
much nothing right and that kind of
stinks but it&#39;s good news because it
really simplifies stuff here&#39;s the deal
there are a couple of basic supplements
that work for health multivitamin maybe
for some people although if you eat a
very complete diet even that&#39;s not
really necessary a fish oil tab or
something like that healthy fats but if
you eat a really good diet with a lot of
fish sources you don&#39;t even eat that and
then if you get in regular fluids you&#39;re
doing okay for yourself you don&#39;t have
to worry about this stuff
overly compared to
something like calories and food
composition right you do however have to
be very wary of claims
how many supplement claims you guys ever
watch TV way late into the night and
watch the super supplement will make you
literally Superman you&#39;re like where&#39;s
the buy now phone number it can&#39;t be
here all day I gotta go to sleep there
it&#39;s number down so you me Superman
tomorrow and our fortune that just
doesn&#39;t really add up and many of these
claims are just a waste of money
unfortunately a waste of your time
alright so lastly let&#39;s figure out some
take-home really simple implications
from all this because we just ran
through like volumes of data in the span
of about 10 minutes here&#39;s the deal
completely unequivocal that being
physically active and the more you can
the better is awesome and you want to
stay at a healthy weight by controlling
the number of calories you eat you don&#39;t
even have to count calories just food
amounts if you&#39;re gaining weight or if
you&#39;re in a healthy weight eat somewhat
less get back into the healthy weight
that is huge it&#39;s the number one thing
you can do to help out your health
through nutrition when you are choosing
foods eat mostly healthy foods just like
we talked about fruits veggies whole
grains lean meats healthy fats a lot of
you how many Ventoux ative lis know what
healthy food really is like if I point
to a cheeseburger I&#39;m like healthy how
many of you yeah sure hey potato chips
of course right no we all pretty much
know what healthy food is but we can
have a wide ranging variety of but we
don&#39;t have to restrict ourselves no
carbs no fats no proteins all that kind
of stuff we just have to do a good job
meet the macro minima I&#39;ll tell you this
meaning the minimum amounts of protein
carbs and fats is incredibly easy unless
you do some kind of really really wonky
diet where you&#39;re intentionally trying
to cut stuff out right there are diets
that fruit at Aryans
for example propose where you only eat
fruit I mean and I mean that completely
literally there is no caveat to that
right it&#39;s a fine way of doing things if
you take some extra precautions but you
have to take a lot of extra precautions
so if you&#39;re eating a relatively normal
diet you don&#39;t have to worry about
meeting macro minima that really happens
itself you get out of protein carbs and
fats just eating healthy and eating a
varied diet time sensibly when you&#39;re
relatively hungry and you need energy
eat when you&#39;re not don&#39;t and if we&#39;re
ever a number of meal times you land per
day that&#39;s on you and it&#39;s really not a
big deal either way for your health
don&#39;t let people guilt trip you into
eating after 6 o&#39;clock all right tell
them that you
I&#39;ve also been waiting for the point 6
p.m. attack gnomes but they just never
showed up right how long can we wait you
want to hydrate normally drink water
with your meals if you&#39;re not thirsty
you don&#39;t have to drink you can consider
some basic supplements maybe a
multivitamin maybe fish oil and maybe
not that&#39;s something to talk about to
nutritionists or a doctor if you don&#39;t
have any deficiencies you&#39;re probably
good to go most people don&#39;t and here&#39;s
the deal there will be another health
documentary coming out probably soon
like there have been many health
documentaries before and health
documentaries are usually not the kind
of boring stuff I&#39;m talking to you guys
about today it is life-and-death stuff
like we&#39;ve all been poisoned by insert
group here big pharma big food big beef
who knows right and they&#39;re all out to
get us and a lot of this kind of
ideology just turns out to make these
diet rules that are ineffectual because
they put so much pressure on us to alter
our normal lifestyles it turns out if we
eat relatively healthy and are
physically active we don&#39;t have to buy
into crazy ideologies that steer us away
from doing the right thing here&#39;s the
deal it&#39;s an amazing world we live in
but I think it&#39;s even more amazing if
you approach it with logic science and
evidence
