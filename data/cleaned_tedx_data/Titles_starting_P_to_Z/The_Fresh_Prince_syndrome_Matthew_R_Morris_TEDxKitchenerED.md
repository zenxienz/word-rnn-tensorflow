I remember walking into one of my
university classrooms at a very early
day in September at the very beginning
of my junior year I had just one of my
chains on and a fitted cap slightly
tilted to the back my drawings were
fresh and the belt holding up my pants
was somewhere around the middle of my
Tommy boxers I hadn&#39;t yet turn off the
music that you could hear blasting
through the headphones around my neck a
milli a milli a milli I&#39;m a young money
million they&#39;re tougher than Nigerian
hair Lil Wayne was popping that year
of course I strolled in late as usual I
was merely repeating my regimen the
patterns of my tried and tested high
school routine that I developed and used
to project and assert my identity by
repeating these behaviors I felt that
created a sense of self and also a sense
of space within a classroom but a
strange thing happened that day in
university in fact had been happening
for a little while pretty much since I
began walking into university classrooms
as a freshman see I will come to class
late on a routine basis hat on still
playing my music and passively looking
around for attention yeah yeah I&#39;m here
it&#39;s me get it the guy who doesn&#39;t care
about school now look at me make my
entrance and please please tell me what
I&#39;m doing wrong
I dared them in fact I thrived off of
that type of interaction and these were
the subconscious thoughts trickling
through my 19 year old psyche as I
twisted that doorknob and smugly walked
to an open seat in the class but there
is a difference I was experiencing
between my high school days and now
University the difference was that every
time I now performed my presence no one
seemed to care there are no looks of
comical relief or supplanted
appreciation from my peers or even
hostile attention from the professor it
felt as though the collective
consciousness of the University room was
whispering keep your damn head
and wear your pants however you want
whoever your name is we barely notice
and hardly care in high school this
performance would yield a completely
opposite experience see back then
finding my place within that school
setting meant navigating it by
indicating my need to belong to an urban
black collective or to say it more
simply embodying the hip-hop culture
that I cherished the challenge is that
the culture most urban black males
ascribed to hip-hop culture is viewed as
the opposite of implicit school culture
hip-hop culture is viewed as the
opposite of implicit school culture you
see it&#39;s not necessarily the history
textbooks that aren&#39;t reflective of our
faces or the English assignments are
silenced particular ways in which we
make meaning but rather how schooling
doubles down on media discourses about
urban black males in hip-hop and the
subsequent mechanisms that then foster
our alienation from school in turn many
black males react to the subjugation by
passively rejecting the school as a
whole look my high school had a no
headgear policy so naturally I want my
hat all the damn time I knew that the
small instance of disrupting the school
culture would garner attention and
elicit that black male validation I was
desperately trying to claim we had four
periods a day and I will come late to
every single one of them
why because I knew that my teacher would
say something to me that be able to
either rudely retort or nonchalantly
brush-off and once again assert my
identity internally I was resisting a
culture that was implicitly devaluing me
Shu
even when I did answer a question in
class attributing my participation to my
boys to the fact that I actually studied
the content was the last thing I wanted
to do as a high school kid see these
small instances of getting attention for
acting out were merely the validation I
needed to be seen as you
cool and black but even these subtle
moments let me to feel slightly
uncomfortable in that space you see the
constant friction between attaining
academic excellence and blackmail
validation reveals an internal friction
that implicitly suggests that once one
does excel in academics
it almost unfortunately feels like he&#39;s
abandoning part of his hip-hop culture I
call this the Fresh Prince syndrome
remember Will Smith on The Fresh Prince
of bel-air he was the class clown the
star of the basketball team the
confidence suave talkin flirt and he was
always fly instead of wearing his blades
are like every other guy he turned his
inside out to showcase his urban
aesthetic style will represented that
quintessential young urban black male
and we could come up with a dozen more
character traits about Will in The Fresh
Prince but not one of them would embody
what we idealize as the universal
student The Fresh Prince syndrome is a
benevolent ailment that plagues urban
black males but wait for the kicker it&#39;s
caused by traditional schooling you see
hegemonic schooling practices are set up
in a way that&#39;s meant to deceive and
ultimately fail black boys in the long
run school insidiously teaches urban
black males to be less urban the things
that hip-hop culture
emphasized things like bravado and
identity and being heard are squashed
out in our classrooms we&#39;re told that
our modes of communication are
illegitimate we&#39;re reminded that the way
we dress won&#39;t be accepted once we get
into the real world ultimately the
school alienates urban black males
creating a fractured authenticity and
the black male subconsciously is
internalizing this but listen there is a
cure to this Fresh Prince syndrome if we
consider the University space in
relation to the high school one we may
be able to come up with
whew those remedies you see in
university the performances that I
enacted from high school were met
completely differently in fact their
performance that I had learned to enact
when I did it in university it was met
with indifference and you know what
happened because of this I stopped using
the school as a site to explicitly
perform my black hood masculinity it
didn&#39;t change how I dressed or how I
talked but it changed how I navigated
that school space because the university
is so lacks in everything outside of the
actual academics I was able to truly be
myself and focus on said academics so if
we took the best of what the University
site provides outside of the academics
and took the best of what the high
school space provides for a growing
intellectual teenagers we may arrive at
a space that retains and engages more
urban black boys and it pushes out and
we can start with a few simple things
high schools must become more lacks with
their explicit rules pertaining to
implicit curriculum for example hats and
particular dress codes constant
surveillance and subtle monitoring
immediately addressing lateness in front
of an entire class autonomous teaching
practices and stereotypical perceptions
are all things that must go by the
wayside if we truly want to foster young
black geniuses and create spaces in
which the performance of black
masculinity is not taken up by these
kids solely as a reaction to hegemonic
resistance look I&#39;m a teacher and as
teachers I know that we must make sure
our students are able to produce
well-structured essays and understand
the concepts of science and answer
questions in geometry and algebra but
perhaps more important than those things
we must be able to personally connect
with each and every one of our students
in a way that validates everyone I like
to call our best and brightest teachers
culture blenders where student agency
academic excellence and validation
independent of superficial performances
are the most pressing
cultures that they push to establish and
when it comes to our black boys when we
really begin to consider the complicated
politics of representation by
understanding the ways in which black
males refuse by whatever means to allow
others to other them will be able to
present a space in a schooling in which
black masculinity is defined more so by
a both/and dichotomy that considers the
complexity of all identity this Fresh
Prince syndrome has been an undiagnosed
disease in our schools for decades if we
make a few of these changes perhaps we
could finally eradicate it thank you
