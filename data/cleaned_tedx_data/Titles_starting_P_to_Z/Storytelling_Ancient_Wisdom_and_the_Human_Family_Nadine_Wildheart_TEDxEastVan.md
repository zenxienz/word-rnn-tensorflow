my name is Nadine and I&#39;m Dutch and
polish
my grandparents had to leave the
desperate conditions of their homelands
after World War two I&#39;m grateful to walk
on the land of those sailors people in
the shared territory of the Musqueam
the Squamish and the slavery
I want to ask everyone a question what
does ancient wisdom mean to you
what happens to us when we don&#39;t listen
to the stories
we don&#39;t know our stories
Dory&#39;s maybe the most complex technology
we have the sum total of our collective
knowledge our collective humanity our
ancestors but the secrets of the
universe inside the stories
I have been learning the European
storytelling tradition from Laura Sims
she was trained by Joseph Campbell and
by Nancy Mellon who&#39;s one of the
founders of the international school of
storytelling in the UK
I also sit with woody Morrison he&#39;s one
of the last crucially trained hide a
history keepers he was trained by the
old ones the tide waters as a little boy
he knows his people&#39;s history two ice
ages ago
he calls me
yeong-ja woman who tells the story of
all the people
P Gong means the old things the ancient
things means I have knowledge of the old
stories of the ancient stories
but it means I listen
a long long time ago there were two
armies battling
and at the end of the day there were two
soldiers standing facing one another and
they looked around they were weary with
the battle and they saw their fallen
comrades all around them and the earth
was soaked red and they looked at one
another and they said it will do us no
honor is finished like this let us rest
the night and in the morning
we&#39;ll finish what was started and only
one of us will return home to our
village
do they sheath their swords and they put
down their shields they took off their
dented helmets and they laid down
and the night through dark and the
silence was broken by one of the
soldiers saying back home I have a son
and when he grows up he wants to be a
soldier just like me
other soldier replied saying back home I
have a daughter and when I look in her
face I see the beauty of my wife in her
youth
he spends the rest of the night telling
each other stories of their villages
their childhoods the stories they heard
as little boys sitting at the feet of
their grandparents
the sky grew light
holder&#39;s got to their feet they put
their dented helmets on they picked up
their shields they place their hands on
the hilt of their sword and standing
there looking at one another
they both nodded and returned home for
their villages
and the grandmother who shared this
story he said you can&#39;t harm someone
once you know their story
we need our stories they are our
original mirrors they are calling us
asking us the wake up
remember listen
and their life-giving
once upon a time there was a king and he
had three sons he ruled with fairness
with justice and everyone obeyed him but
one day he woke up and he was blind
body was withered
when a vision is given to you you don&#39;t
have to look but if you don&#39;t that&#39;s
when you start to go blind
if you don&#39;t listen to the stories you
can&#39;t see where you come from
furries make the invisible visible
as a story of the blind king continues
we meet one of my favorite characters in
fairy tales the youngest son rides out
to help his father and he goes over
seven mountains and down seven valleys
he crosses a glacier and comes to the
dry cracked barren landscape and up
ahead he sees a dark shape some things
glinting and it catches his eye he rides
out over towards it and as he approaches
it he sees that is an old rail man and
in his hands the glinting object is
revealed to be a needle and thread
the old man his clothes are threadfin
and his beard it was in the wind
and there he is bending over going up
the graph sir
howling and listening to stories is a
healing
the story is a message
when I was ten my parents separated and
my mother took me and my four younger
brothers the ones day was my
grandparents my omen OPA they lived on
the shores of Lake Erie it was a spring
time later that summer I watched my
middle brother Orie drown in front of my
eyes
or months later it was Christmas Eve and
we were at my polish grandparents my
babcha and jojos we got a phone call my
father had been in a car accident
he died the next day on Christmas
at 13 I went into foster care and I
never returns home
the day my father died is the day I went
blind
when I was 19 I was experiencing the
most excruciating grief
I felt lost and abandoned
you
I had no sense of home and no connect
by 19 I found my way to tree planting
and I planted for over seven years and
for the first three years I was the
worst planter ever
I cried every single day in my lands
half the time I couldn&#39;t even see the
land through my tears I didn&#39;t realize
how poisoned I was by the grief and the
sorrow
I would lay down everyday in the land
and I&#39;d let my tears fall into the earth
but the forest held me and it witnessed
me and in doing so
I began to heal I was allowed to begin
to see what the brief is eating me
go through it and to feel it
my teacher woody
he told me when something leaves you
that it needs to be replaced with
something and as I laid there on the
earth crying my ears leaving that&#39;s when
I felt the magic in the land I means the
magic of the land was replacing my
sorrow and my brief
and I was no longer blinded by the grief
and in that stillness
I could feel
here an even deeper voice calling me
home telling me learn all I could about
the ancient earth wisdom and once that&#39;s
woody where&#39;d his stories come from
and he got that still quiet Farah found
in his voice and he said Oh way over
there on the horizon
he told me
of us
and the future is behind us and we don&#39;t
know what&#39;s coming we don&#39;t have control
have to keep our minds saw that we can
see the Far periphery not narrow-minded
thinking that what we see in front of us
is all there is
ancestors left a path for us all the way
back there horizon
and then we can go down
that&#39;s still quiet place inside where we
can sense the presence of the ancestors
and that is how we know what is true
one day I was on the bus and it drove by
the Polish community center and I pulled
for the stop and I got off I walked into
the office and I said hello my name is
Nadine I&#39;m half Polish and I&#39;d like to
learn about my culture I like to learn
about my culture before Poland became a
nation-state
how did our people live over there
ceremonies or their traditions
they looked at me and they blink
I told them I wanted to learn the
stories I wanted to learn the cross who
could teach me
that&#39;s how it was decided that I would
join the Polish folk dance troupe
and for the next two years every week
for three hours I went to folk dance
practice
and there was something indescribable
about being around polish people their
bodies made sense to me hearing the
language reminds me of my butcher and
Jojo I love dancing the waltzes of
mazurkas the polyneices
and as I danced those old dances the
geometry of those old dances
something awakens in my blood something
was sparked inside of me and I felt joy
my first year of dancing we were to
dance of the European Festival they had
booths set up from all over Europe and
that was a defining moment for me that&#39;s
when I realized I am European I am NOT
North American the way that the costumes
fit spoke to me it awakens something it
awakened this love inside of me that I
didn&#39;t even know that I had for European
culture and I wanted to learn more but I
also wanted to be respectful of the
lands that I walked on of the Coast
Salish people so before we were to dance
the weekend before to dance I went to
the First Nations Friendship Centre and
I asked some of my friends what&#39;s the
protocol for thinking the lands for the
ancestors the things of people who walk
on this land
I do I acknowledge and ask permission to
dance my ancestral dance on this land
my friend shared these protocols with me
the day that we were to dance there I
was standing in my traditional Polish
ancestral dress
and I stepped away and I said some
prayers I took a few moments give thanks
to the lands into the ancestors here
let them know what this dance meant to
me
I knew that the land is watching me and
by doing it this way the ancestors are
proud of me
Uncle Phil she Phil Lane jr.
he&#39;s one of the elders who wrote the
treaty the international treaty to
protect and restore mother earth
you&#39;d shared with me once
but the pain of one is the pain of all
and the honor of one is the honor of all
and as I sat and I listen to that
still felt the pain of my relationship
with my mother
now I had sat in ceremony
you farvel looking horse
he&#39;s a Lakota elder in the 19th
generation pipe carrier for the White
Buffalo Calf woman spike
it said that we all had an umbilical
cord back to the earth
now my mother was coming to visit me in
a couple months
and I knew I wanted to have a mother
honoring ceremony for her
now I have it an ongoing relationship
with the elders that I sit with and so I
called summon them up and I asked them
how do I do this in a good way
and they shared some of their traditions
with me for honoring mothers and the
female aspect of life
I invited my friends my native friends
knew an honoring ceremony for a mother
were there
their drums and I made a feast for
everyone and one of the most powerful
moments for me was giving my mother the
cedar woven basket that I had handmade
for her I had placed rose petals in it
and a rose quartz heart and I looked at
my mom and I said mom I was told that we
were all like a basket and we have to
look into our basket and make sure that
we&#39;re not carrying something that isn&#39;t
ours to carry the rose petals in here
represent your womb where you grew my
heart my brain my eyes and my fingernail
kourt&#39;s heart represents the heartbeat
that you gave me
thank you for giving me life
q for being my mother
my mom and I cried
and I could feel
the pain of the past
and in that space the song of love build
it
my mom and I were so overjoyed through
her tears as we could start to finally
have the relationship that we had always
wanted
I was told that when we heal ourselves
we heal seven generations back and seven
generations forward
I think back to those tree planting days
crying in my land and how that past is
in front of me now and how I&#39;ve followed
the path of the ancient ones
I think about the future I have with my
mother that has become
how I was led to sit with the First
Nations and how their stories led me to
want to learn about the stories of my
own ancestral identity
how it allowed me to feel strong enough
to heal myself in the relationship with
my mother
look at those wounds and let them be so
not
this is how
I was learning what in height us out my
deny it means my being my entire being
it means the knowledge isn&#39;t just coming
into my mind but it&#39;s coming into my
entire being and this is a way of
calming the knowing
this is how I started to learn to
generate my own light it&#39;s a different
way of knowing a different way of seeing
and that is what connects me the ancient
was
a story is so big it holds all of our
personal stories within it it&#39;s what
held our ancestors and what will heal
is what taught them the values of how to
live together stories each behavior
how to repair our relationship
to be human
the story is the message it allows us to
feel what our ancestors felt when they
knew how to stand in the great circle
when they knew that we are all part of
the human family
respecting each other&#39;s origins all the
way back with her horizon
what do you told me about being able to
see the power that is the wind it&#39;s the
cycles of life that move the wind and
that&#39;s how we can find our song in the
universe
that&#39;s what we&#39;ll bring our heartbeat to
the other without my heart in your heart
i won
