I like to start with a riddle and that
is what
across the elephant in a rhino Oh fine
oh so I guess you can kind of tell what
part of my topic is about but the main
part is that kids can do anything that
they set their minds to or anything that
they believe in my sister Brady and I
are super lucky we&#39;ve been able to go to
Africa a few times or get more specific
Burana which is a place in Kenya and the
Dyer family have been telling us about
the poaching problems there and around
this time last year we decided to stop
hearing about this problem and decided
to do something and we found three steps
to that and that is what is the problem
what is the goal and how can you help or
how can I help explain a little bit more
problem that we found was poaching and
the reason why it&#39;s a problem is because
these animals could be gone by the time
we eat oberg students are out of college
which is hard to believe and hard to
think of because they&#39;re just super
amazing animals and super amazing I just
think they&#39;re super cool and I wouldn&#39;t
want to live in a world without them
what is the goal the goal that we have
is to raise awareness for these animals
read them to live safe and not being any
harm of being extinct and to raise
awareness for the Rangers who are these
people who risk their lives every day to
protect them it&#39;s super hard to become
one of them - you have to go through
like a series of training it&#39;s like
being a really cool army guy that
basically trying to protect these
animals so as I said we couldn&#39;t really
keep on hearing about it so we decided
to try something and we heard this so
healy phrase which is right here which I
don&#39;t really know how to pronounce but
after I learned my Latin class here I
kind of want to learn how but in English
it means you don&#39;t know what you can do
until you try
the name crashing heard is pretty simple
because
is a grouper rhino and herd is a group
of elephant so after that we made a
website for it and it shows a bunch of
items that we sell and events that are
gonna happen soon and we try to get
people to sponsor us by going in our
town in Virginia and knocking on local
businesses doors and trying to get them
to sponsor us and we learned that
probably about only one out of a hundred
people will say yes but after we got
enough people we were able to host a
movie night I saw a kind of kickoff
event and we showed movie The Lion King
because Disney was inspired by the
people in Burana because they thought it
was just a super amazing place like we
thought the fun fact Pride Rock is
actually called frog Rock because if you
stand in a certain spot it looks like a
cog so then we decided to sell items
with these women in Africa yeah there&#39;s
one right here actually and what&#39;s
different about these here is that
they&#39;re all one solid color and the
reason that is because in their culture
they all mean different things
red means strength black means unity
blue means nourishment yellow means
fertility white means purity and orange
means friendship so a lot of people will
tell us that it&#39;s this is something too
hard for us to do or that we shouldn&#39;t
even try to do it and that we&#39;re too
young but I want to say thank you to a
bunch of other people who have helped us
and these people are miss Dixon Dewey
the dyers Sam and mr. Cooper so thank
you for encouraging us and the
salamander resort has been a super big
sponsor of us because they&#39;ve let us
host a 5k race there it took a lot of
work just like hosting this TEDx talk
but it took a lot of work and about two
weeks before we even started it only 16
people signed up which it&#39;s just hard to
think of cuz it takes that much work
but after about once it started over a
hundred people came and that just felt
really good that this many people care
and believe our problem too and this
June we&#39;re also hosting a second annual
in the same spot and we&#39;re also doing a
bunch of virtual runs which are you can
run anywhere you want anywhere in the
world basically and you will go to the
website type in how far you ran how long
it took you and we&#39;ll send you a medal
to thank you for your support because
every little bit helps sort of bring it
to full circle
my sister Brady and I aren&#39;t any better
than any one of you we don&#39;t have any
special potion or sauce or anything we
just found a problem and made that our
goal to solve that problem and then we
want to make sure to not let being a kid
stop you from achieving your goals if
you find a problem go for it because
after all you don&#39;t know what you can do
until you try
Asante
