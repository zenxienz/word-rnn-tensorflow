thank you okay hoping my mics working
good first of all I&#39;m on the screen
there that&#39;s pretty scary I&#39;m not gonna
lie if you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m not
smiling my dad told me to but I didn&#39;t
want it I wanted to look good
okay that&#39;s the reason okay I&#39;m gonna
get this started hi um I&#39;m a filmmaker
and photographer my talk today is about
why I don&#39;t go to school I don&#39;t believe
the current education system works when
I was in school they told me I was
stupid I&#39;ve since found out I&#39;m not I&#39;m
running my own business making
promotional films and crowdfunding for
my own short film doing things my way
instead of their way now on the subject
of film make and you&#39;re probably
wondering what is that that is
filmmaking a hundred years ago very
different as you can see to what people
use now just a simple smartphone so um
yeah that&#39;s filmmaking a hundred years
ago this is fermenting today as you can
see a lot has changed but the school
system has stayed exactly the same just
like a hundred years ago one teacher
stands in front of 20 kids and teaches
them the same thing the same way and if
they get it they&#39;re smart and if they
don&#39;t then sometimes they&#39;re dumb
we&#39;re all encouraged to follow the same
path one of my favorite filmmakers Casey
Neistat says and I quote if you&#39;re doing
what everyone else is doing
then you&#39;re doing it wrong and I believe
what school is doing is not letting
children be individuals and killing
creativity in a way and not letting them
be their selves now do we have to play
by the rules to be successful well
Quentin Tarantino is I&#39;m sure a lot of
you familiar with often said in
interviews that he never went to film
school he went to films Sir Richard
Branson has a net worth of 5 billion
dollars I believe and he dropped out of
school
Allan sugar has a net worth of 1.2
billion and he managed one Oh level and
my favorite of the whole list Steven
Spielberg was repeatedly rejected by
film school which I find just
unbelievable so how do we revolutionize
education to suit the individual firstly
we have
except there&#39;s a problem because
scientists say that no two brains are
the same and one size definitely does
not fit all perhaps we could have
shorter days no tests focus on what
students want to do with their life
instead of what they&#39;re expected to do
we can look to what Finland is achieving
as an example and teach students more
about the real world
I leave you guys then with the challenge
how we build a bridge between the new
world and the old school thank you for
listening
