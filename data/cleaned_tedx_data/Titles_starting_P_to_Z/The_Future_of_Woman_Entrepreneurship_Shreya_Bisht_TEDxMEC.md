answer one comes tomorrow I think now I
needed on honest answer from everyone so
how many ICAO young students of them so
how many of you have ever thought about
Sun in your countries in experience how
many of these hands how many opinions
I know I see my money I started my
watchful journey about three years ago
and it was something that was outside
then I didn&#39;t want to do it was
something that that the C word fitting
right and I German he remembered the
time I was there walk to my bed manager
and I was with the intention of telling
him that I live in Europe and I was
walking to him and I was thinking oh so
embarrassing
but when he actually asked me why leave
your job and I&#39;m gonna tell him that oh
I&#39;m going to my own startup and maybe I
was thinking to myself what if he laughs
at me and I&#39;m scared I was embarrassed
and that&#39;s not that&#39;s what we need
suppose write me a 24 girl then trying
to take on the world
I was scared and it&#39;s founded observed
when it repel you manager that if you
wanna like a job and you are to your own
sorry oven journey so why is it
four girls are on their own in a country
like India where feminism and gender
equality are considered a joke this is
what is expected let&#39;s talk about the
FBI rankings in India FBI sign for
female entrepreneurship index FBI
rankings done in 2015
India was crying 70 out of the 77
participating countries and India I mean
Egypt and Saudi Arabia had better
rankings in India we will leave it on us
it&#39;s really really hard and so I want to
talk about some of the challenges that I
face as a female entrepreneur and by the
end of this talk I hope I have helped
some females out here who who have this
thing in mind I know what such as
showing yourself
so here&#39;s a few things that are stopping
females and we may all starts from
becoming Morris here number one is
knowing your own words you may disagree
with me on this we say we teach of
weapon to dream to fly with the wind but
you will really mean it it&#39;s not that
we&#39;re not delicious it&#39;s just that we
don&#39;t know what we can achieve
we just routinely undermine our own
abilities that&#39;s number one
that&#39;s what stopping us number two is
only respect of your employees it&#39;s true
this is especially an issue when you
have made colleagues and they&#39;re older
than you and I have been working for
three years in a syrup and I&#39;m just very
6 so our male colleagues were older than
me as even female colleagues but this
one is
quality so I talked about the meatball
it&#39;s older than me or who came from a
more decorative pedigree if you know
what I mean you might even they would
not listen to anything that I have to
say so if you are a female and you ever
want to leave your listeners if you are
female and you ever wanna leave be
prepared for gender biases of the end of
all and it&#39;s real it&#39;s really really
really real disregarded so the constant
bickering that hopping and disregard for
your opinions ideas and even this
visions it will show you everything that
strong about society so another story
that I&#39;m gonna tell you because the
marriage makes things better so a few
years ago we because it&#39;s a start-up so
we need to have a degree so we hired a
decade in our team it was I think early
2016 and this guy had a lot of
experience he had he was receiving he
was good at what he did but he never
could really sands the room working for
me
voting for a female and this was the guy
from IIT right so so every suggestions
that I would make he used to strain out
ridicule then he disregarded them and he
said yeah miss is not going to work I&#39;m
not gonna he never really said it&#39;s not
going to work but he never actually
expected any resolutions now these same
suggestions when made by my male
colleagues oh he took them with utter
respect he said oh yes this is what the
work now why is that
but in this situation soon I had to put
my foot down
and I have Belgium over what was right
and what hard we go I read it somewhere
that successful women successful women
are not really likable
they are bossy in nature and nobody they
don&#39;t try to work with no one I have fun
with them now Jenya pious in workplace
don&#39;t start early on so if you&#39;re in
college right now or if you think about
gender bias right now you will see it
because gender bias will come to you in
early years of your career gender bias
will really really come to you when
you&#39;re trying to advance to a more
competitive position in your workplace
and then and then we will happen is
often for these females being an
associate pressure to assume a more
traditional or a feminine role and that
is why we see a lot of a chose and
that&#39;s why a father because you know
going apne become an HR chemistry the
things that are stopping us the topic am
talk now the things that are stopping us
from becoming Future Leaders number
three is difficult business negotiations
it&#39;s true I said how it is it&#39;s really
hard to meet you sale but in India it&#39;s
hard to do business without often having
to engage with a lower class and all
will be wrong
whereas the lower class what I&#39;m really
hinting at it&#39;s not the queer or the
modest living on the daily wage but the
pompous guys we&#39;ve all met and we&#39;ve all
hit the onion culture the uncivilized
ones who believe in male chauvinism
the ones who believe our only place is
in the kitchen and we struggle with a
very systematic gender discrimination in
India and I&#39;m again going to give you a
good example so reach me or maybe three
months ago two months ago a designer on
he started working with a client she&#39;s a
freelance designer I won&#39;t say her name
or the city human she&#39;s just mean a
designer and she&#39;s I am working on a
project so she has me she has really
good reviews of burns and she has she
was brilliantly she has amazing reviews
forgetting one more thing about oh yeah
she&#39;s won top designers from coast city
for example if you&#39;re talking about
Kochi your feet off my back he or she
was one of the top designers in there so
she I also know that about her that she
was really striving Newsted in her own
home for the past few years right so she
takes up this project and this is a
project of designing a cafe in Bandra
Mumbai so she starts this project and it
happens with most of us but what
happened is there was a timeline delay
is so for execu specially if you&#39;re
writing your video shot with a
commercial business you don&#39;t want these
projects to run late because then you go
crazy on the rent and everything so the
guy really wanted the project completion
time when there were some delays you
think it&#39;s a crane cetera and so what we
really heard is the tiny coming through
designer or was not now saying all this
finances I heard all this business as
you know ruin me you&#39;re taking so much
time know what he had to say was so so
China bias he said in a given Iowa
that&#39;s what he said and that&#39;s what we
hear all the time and my new this is a
rich dude
under Mumbai great its 2017 I&#39;m outraged
and biggest women across all the
industries a spill in urine some of
these binary backward are cute and yet
an optimistic because why atleast I
accuse are not something you what&#39;s new
is that we&#39;re now making the front page
I&#39;m making noise about it and now it
means you&#39;re outraged together right and
that gives me hope that there will be a
better tomorrow for help us now another
thing that want to talk about is about
stopping us again from becoming Future
Leaders is a good support system or a
lot of fluid violence this is a mistake
so let&#39;s be honest they have very few
female years in India and not just in
business but in politics sports or
bollywood bollywood specially where
women are second consider taking for the
bank so seriously one who love you back
to I&#39;ll be looking at privilege it&#39;s
Ellen DeGeneres be Oprah to LA and don&#39;t
ID enemies and I can and I love her but
we we we cannot relate to them with on
country or socially aligned with their
story they have really different stories
they have have different struggles and
we can align with them we can tell
ourselves that if they can so can we
we need to hear more success stories all
Indian women another incident I talked
about and this happened last weekend so
I made a friend and we started talking
about work and how things are going and
we start talking about the six I was
giving the Senate speech we start
talking on a low number of people
entrepreneurs in India and he said he
said you know what it&#39;s only because
there are no proven strong leaders women
are not proven strong leaders right and
said hey when you and I broke it down to
the very kindly very gently then first
it&#39;s because we don&#39;t have that many
role models right and second it&#39;s
because the media is doing a really
really bad job of removing these women
entrepreneurs what are you making it and
third and most importantly it&#39;s because
of male colleagues like you who refuse
to accept that there was a certain
gender discrimination when you make a
decision that&#39;s affecting or that
includes supporting funding or just
communicating with a female undercover
as I said it&#39;s not talking about because
I hope honorable cycle so this was found
this might not be true for all of you
but this was born without for me is the
problems I faced when I was fundraising
and for those of you who were not
familiar with the side of ego system
raising money is then start of the
state&#39;s funding from investors in
exchange for its shares and XP is back
for you out of the 617 startups
pointed in India in 2016 are the 670
only when you burn were founded by
better it&#39;s a story that no is a lot of
people really the story of cash with
make sure
go fire of the muse the news is a really
really big saga with us and it is a
lovely example of just how many I&#39;m
called Polycrates people on spinners and
even founders have to go through raising
funds right so Mitchell capturing the
school adultery casually went to many
investors right
I personally when we were fundraising I
think I went to 20 investors and that
was a lot it&#39;s a lot of work I went in
20 investors and we successfully erased
one friend Sarah Mitchell when she was a
fundraising peristyle she went to be our
message and nobody would have a bitch
and the ones who did know her finish
caption said these people they mistook
her the leadership qualities are a
conference for him asuka&#39;s oh she&#39;s
charming not not didn&#39;t think old she
can become a good leader
no they said she&#39;s charming that&#39;s what
they said it so and even later when the
coverage was hard this is a reaction to
God and she happened me my new pretty VC
firms to just raise one person so all
these problems what does the peachoid
press because as you know we&#39;re talking
about the future right now we say that
it&#39;s equal for both men and women but
it&#39;s not it&#39;s a whole lot harder to
solve is a women and I know that but how
do you fix these things we&#39;re creating
awareness health do we need more
feminists campaigns no you know we don&#39;t
but you not force it down the society
who&#39;s not ready to accept any change
there&#39;s no
to change a society is not in a
free-market economic forces that would
right so we so these economic forces
they win and they need to bring down the
change and if we need these economic
forces to bring down the change we need
to tell the world the birth of female
entrepreneurs we enable these market
forces by proving the words of female
entrepreneurs if your actions in the
next decade that will pay the future
pave the way to future women right this
is something that I quote and I really
like here whoever seven I think this was
going to Tech Talks we recorded and she
said the only future we are going into
the only future we are going into is the
one we create right now thank you
[Applause]
