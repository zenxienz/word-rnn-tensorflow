imagine war coming to your doorstep
imagine your home being destroyed by an
earthquake or a hurricane everything
changes you can no longer look after
yourself or your family not here
not anymore it&#39;s time to move imagine
what you lose what you leave behind
relatives friends prized possessions
your wedding photo your child&#39;s favorite
toy your home your way of life a sense
of purpose a sense of belonging
imagine the struggles that you face on
your journey
imagine the choices that you have to
make to stay to go to stop to continue
to leave someone behind perhaps imagine
finding sanctuary and assistance that
sense of relief and waiting an
uncertainty you don&#39;t really want to be
here you know even sure where here is
but at least it feels safer for now
imagine receiving food at least do you
think it&#39;s food it&#39;s not stuff that you
eat normally it&#39;s not stuff that you
know how to prepare you&#39;ve heard there&#39;s
other food stuff that&#39;s more palatable
nearby the camp not too far away but you
don&#39;t have any money left you spent all
of your precious precious resources
getting this far you could of course
sell the food that you&#39;ve been given to
buy something you&#39;d rather eat
we don&#39;t really speak the language you
don&#39;t know the local customs the markets
the prices imagine being asked your
opinion by people who arrive and white
four-by-fours with different colored
logos on the side wearing different
colored vests at first this feels good
someone wants to hear my opinion your
opinion where you come from what you
need what you hope and fears are
who you are but after a while it gets a
little bit irritating different people
come asking similar questions and not
much seems to change now where you to
find yourself in a situation like this
the chances are you would encounter one
of tens of thousands of people who like
me work for humanitarian aid agency
people who again like me got into this
line of work because we wanted to
alleviate the suffering caused by war
and disaster we wanted to make a
difference people who care and yet as
the examples I&#39;ve tried to give you
illustrate often there&#39;s a disconnect
between the aid worker and the people
that we try to assist there&#39;s a
breakdown in communication somewhere
along the line the human has dropped out
of humanitarian and this is a problem
it&#39;s a problem not only because there&#39;s
a sort of fundamental contradiction
between the human impulse to help and
the frustration of being helped in the
wrong way or having your opinions
ignored it&#39;s a problem because studies
show that the longer people are passive
recipients of aid the more that initial
feeling of somebody cares for me I&#39;m no
longer alone gives way to a sense of
frustration helplessness and despair
studies also show that one of the key
things that helps people move out of
poverty and take control of their lives
is a sense of self belief belief in
their own self efficacy so we can see
that there&#39;s a fundamental disconnect
here something isn&#39;t quite working I
think it&#39;s really important when talking
about this problem to recognize that
this isn&#39;t about the failing of an
individual aid worker or the failing of
individual aid agencies it&#39;s altogether
too systemic and systematic this is a
common problem there&#39;s something about
how aid is delivered that leads to this
and why is that then what is it about
aid that leads to this problem or how we
do aid that leads to this problem so I
want to offer it for observations that I
made in the last 25 years working in in
aid agencies as to why I think this
problem arises and why persists and then
we&#39;ll talk about what I think we can do
about it so the first of these problems
is scale now if you reflect on the sheer
number of people in need of assistance
and you reflect upon what that means for
organizations who try to respond you can
see that there&#39;s a real push towards
standardization it&#39;s a lot easier to
help lots of people if you take if
you&#39;re you&#39;re delivering as it were
programming in a box it&#39;s much harder to
think outside of that box similarly if
you think about how easy it is or
relatively easy it is to listen to one
person or a handful of people hear their
opinions and respond accordingly and
then you think about well what would
that feel like in a refugee camp or with
thousands of people on the move you can
see why scale pushes us to standardize a
related problem is one of urgency right
everything we do is under the pressure
of time sometimes it&#39;s because there
literally are lives at stake and people
will die if things don&#39;t happen within a
certain specified time period but more
generally there&#39;s a debt there&#39;s a
there&#39;s a time pressure there&#39;s a desire
to help as many people as possible at
the lowest possible cost and that really
puts pressure on your ability to respond
so again urgency pushes us in the
direction of standardization in a sense
a related problem is one of habit okay
we all have habits we all have patterns
of behavior you all know what this feels
like you know how difficult it is to
break out of patterns that you have
established in your own lives
think about the aid worker moving from
crisis to crisis and bringing with them
accumulated experience about what works
or what has worked in other
circumstances and bringing with them
evidence of what&#39;s worked across a whole
host of other places that they perhaps
haven&#39;t necessarily worked in themselves
all of this is good stuff this is really
really useful but can also serve as a
set of blinkers you can forget that each
situation is unique each person an
individual but by far I think the
most important of the reasons for this
this disconnect this problem is a
question of power our customers don&#39;t
really get to shop around for
alternative service providers very
easily right it&#39;s not that kind of
arrangement we as aid providers are
beholden to the people who provide money
to us to deliver assistance we are not
beholden to our clients to our customers
to our end-users and that changes and
affect everything and I think there&#39;s
something we can do about that and I
think there&#39;s something you can do about
that but we&#39;ll come back to that at the
end of this talk so four problems
and all four reasons for a problem and I
think this at least pushes us to think
that any solution to this problem needs
to be both scalable it needs to work
under emergency or urgent settings it
needs to break and challenge our habits
and assumptions but most of all it needs
to shake those power relations so what
can we do about this how do we deal I&#39;ve
got three solutions that I&#39;d like to
propose these are things that are
already up and running they&#39;re being
pushed forward by individuals by
individual aid agencies and by
communities of like-minded people across
the world the first of these
paradoxically you might say as a way of
restoring human dignity or humanity into
a relationship is cash cold hard cash
notes coins vouchers an ATM card
it might be a transfer to someone&#39;s
mobile phone whatever is appropriate to
the context in question why give people
stuff blankets tents food buckets stuff
that they end up selling more often than
not in order to buy what they actually
feel they need why not give people
choice and a little bit of power in a
world in which they&#39;ve lost both now
when this was first floated some years
ago people&#39;s reaction was or some
people&#39;s reaction was hang on a minute
you can&#39;t possibly give cash to an aid
recipient
they&#39;ll squander it they&#39;ll waste it on
on cigarettes or alcohol and some people
stay still say this today let&#39;s get back
to our imagination exercise that we
started with there you are in your camp
you&#39;ve got nothing you&#39;re given some
cash now are you going to blow it on a
short-term fix or are we going to use it
to meet the urgent needs of yourself and
your family members
studies show repeatedly that that is
exactly what people do in multiple
contexts and it&#39;s been studied over and
over again people use cash wisely and
better than that cash has a really
positive effect cash has assistance has
a really positive effect on the local
economy now this example comes from
Lebanon where cash grants of one hundred
and fifty dollars in value translated
into three hundred and twenty dollars of
economic activity in the local economy
so why is that important in Lebanon one
in four people twenty five percent of
the population are refugees imagine the
strain that places on the country on
social relations on the local economy on
local services what&#39;s good for the local
economy in the host population is good
for the newcomer benefit in local
economic action and interaction
translates into renewed support for the
important concepts of sanctuary refuge
and assistance so cash is generally a
very very positive and important
solution so I&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s the
only solution nor am i saying it is
necessarily appropriate in all contexts
right we can imagine situations where
there&#39;s no functioning market we can
imagine situations where a might put
people at risk but I think the question
that needs to be on all of our lips is
why not cash the presumption needs to be
cash first okay so that&#39;s one solution
and it&#39;s beginning to move now that
doesn&#39;t solve everything right
remember how frustrating it was to have
your opinion not heard so the next again
optical word perhaps for restoring
humanity data but here I mean the right
kind of data in the right amount at the
right time and used in the right way so
what do I mean by that okay let&#39;s stop
imagining you&#39;re fleeing war let&#39;s
imagine now that you&#39;re in my shoes or
those of my colleague you&#39;re running a
massive project you&#39;re on a huge time
pressure
you&#39;ve got donor deliverables that you
have to meet and the situation&#39;s
changing all the time whose voice do you
listen to who do you ask there&#39;s
thousands of people who do you ask how
do you ask that
what if they tell you something that you
can&#39;t respond to so these are the kind
of fears and hindrances that we face as
a duo because this is the challenge that
faces us when it comes to listening to
people&#39;s opinions and people tend to aid
workers tend to react in one of two ways
right there&#39;s they headed in the sound
approach right I&#39;m just can&#39;t deal with
this there&#39;s too many voices I&#39;m just
going to deliver what I said I was going
to do what it says in my documents and
I&#39;ll do some good that&#39;s the head in the
sand approach it&#39;s not great the other
approach is to go completely the other
way an over survey ask loads of
questions generate loads of reports if
only we could just really understand the
situation then we could do the right
thing and that yields massive reports
that sit on people&#39;s desks and gather
dust
they&#39;re never read because they arrive
too late or they&#39;re just too long people
don&#39;t have the time so what&#39;s the answer
we need to be as nimble with our data as
we are in always we strive to be with
our assistance right we need to survey
we need to take a temperature check but
a very very light one very few questions
asked quite often to get a sense of
whether or not what we&#39;re doing is what
people need and what they feel about it
we need to use that data to start a
conversation go in and check our
assumptions see really what is going on
our people are we hearing what people
think they&#39;re telling us and can we get
can we close that gap and then we
actually need to use that information we
need to make changes we need to
course-correct and we need to see if
that affects people&#39;s people&#39;s sense of
whether or not we&#39;re on on track or not
and this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t impossible
right this this path has been charted
for us in the customer satisfaction
industry and in public services the
world over
there&#39;s a lot that we can learn from
them so okay improve cash or using cash
to improve assistance improve data to
figure out what&#39;s going on but as we saw
it&#39;s not always easy to change people&#39;s
habits right and that brings us to what
I think is the third and the most
important of the solution sets which is
accountability
all right what we&#39;re held to account for
affects absolutely everything how we
organize how we define success how we
reward good practice and what we need is
a shift in incentives and a bit of a
behavioral nudge to get us back on track
and using the kind of things that we&#39;ve
just been talking about so that&#39;s where
you come in all right and this time I
don&#39;t mean you the imagined refugee and
I don&#39;t mean you the imagined aid worker
I mean you really you if you pay taxes
you are a donor if you give to charity
you are a donor if you have an opinion
about this world that we&#39;re living in
you have an important voice and all I&#39;m
asking is that you use it contact your
political representative contact the
government donor agency that channels
your taxes contact the charity that you
support and ask them some very simple
questions
do they give cash assistance if not why
not
do they know if their customers their
clients their beneficiaries are happy
with what they do how do they know that
could they publish that information
publicly right one of the benefits of
the world that we live in now is pretty
much anyone anywhere can find out
anything if it&#39;s in the public domain
right help us get the right stuff out
into the public domain and ask us the
right questions so working together I
think you can help us to remember the
original human impulse that got us
involved in this work in the first place
I think you can help us to restore some
dignity some control and some power to
people who have lost so much
thank you very much
[Applause]
