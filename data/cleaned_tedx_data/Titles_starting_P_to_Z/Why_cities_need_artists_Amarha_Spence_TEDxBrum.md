how&#39;s everybody doing everybody good yes
all right let&#39;s have a Chapman let&#39;s
have a chat Birmingham why is it that we
have a situation when in 2017 it feels
so as cities being sold off to the
highest bidder what does that say about
our culture if we&#39;re at threat of it
being shaped not by the people of the
city but by money Birmingham we like to
talk about it being a young and diverse
that you don&#39;t mean all the creativity
we like that why do we have one black
led art space please correct me if I&#39;m
wrong I can think of one black led art
space in this city what up what up I&#39;m
an artist my wares are artists in the
room yes we hear our master day all
right then I&#39;m an artist my I said I&#39;m
gonna come out here and say that with my
chest I&#39;m an artist and normally when I
say that out loud it solicits a couple
of different responses sometimes a cheer
sometimes a yeah sometimes that&#39;s it&#39;s
alright man it&#39;s alright I figured you
know what it&#39;s a misunderstood vocation
it&#39;s either your cup of tea or it&#39;s not
really your thing&#39;s cool man it&#39;s cool
I&#39;m an artist that creates things to
serve people whether that be
storytelling whether that be music
whether that be building better
platforms for people or creating
physical space I create things that
serve and I&#39;ve been doing this now for
about 12 years and now I only look about
14 I&#39;ve been doing this for a while man
and it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard but I&#39;m still
going I set up a company when I was 21
years old as a way to try and create the
opportunities that I felt I couldn&#39;t
access if you can&#39;t find a way you make
your own and that&#39;s something I&#39;ve
learnt from a granddad man who here&#39;s
got Caribbean grandparents whoa yes
likkle islands we&#39;d be there yes I learn
a lot from my granddad man
came here when he was 16 years old back
in 1960 on his own from the Caribbean
everything I know about resilience about
overcoming adversity he&#39;s already laid
the blueprint for me I remember being 4
years old and I watched him take flour
water a sprinkle of cornmeal and a
little bit of salt and he made the
all-mighty dumpling Birmingham if that&#39;s
not artistry I don&#39;t know what is man I
don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know how to know
don&#39;t Klinsmann like I say everything
that I know about adversity overcoming
adversity I&#39;ve learned from him and I
wanted to celebrate that I&#39;m an artist
when I like something when I don&#39;t I
create as it&#39;s the only thing I know how
to do I create so I said you know I&#39;m
gonna write a play about him because he
deserves to be on stage if you met him
you know what I&#39;m talking about I said
I&#39;m gonna write a play and it&#39;s gonna
celebrate him and it&#39;s gonna attempt to
find parallels between us a little
something happened when I was making
that play guys it&#39;s a little I got
pregnant I&#39;m a true farmer trooper so I
said you know I&#39;m gonna carry on making
this show and I did and I was on the
road actually developing it and I was
invited to do a couple of residency&#39;s I
did a couple in London it&#39;s a funny City
man it&#39;s a funny City I was I was
staying there for a week here in a week
there in a week there had no money had
yet to be paid didn&#39;t know where my next
pay was gonna be I could do a whole
other segment about artists pay or
artists not being paid or not being paid
on time I&#39;m gonna save that for another
time but I had no money and I had to
stay thankfully I had a very generous
friend who allowed me to stay on her
couch at the best of times a couch it&#39;s
not ideal when you&#39;re six months
pregnant it&#39;s probably not advisable but
we keep going anyway and but it got me
thinking I&#39;m on this couch I&#39;m trying to
find something to focus on for when I
finished this and I go on to maternity
leave and it&#39;s probably like a
combination of being skinned not knowing
where my money was coming from thinking
about where I&#39;m gonna stay and
maybe watching too much Jane the Virgin
on maternity leave I decided I&#39;m gonna
set up a hotel because yeah but it&#39;s
gonna be an artist lead hotel and by
that I mean a space that&#39;s conjured up
designed by artists and communities I
think it&#39;s important here that I say I
don&#39;t see as artists as existing in a
vacuum we were talking about this
earlier today artists don&#39;t exist in a
vacuum they&#39;re part of the communities
just as much as anybody else and I don&#39;t
want it to seem like I&#39;m advocating for
artists to be something separate things
that are artists led they take everybody
and so the artists led her the idea for
the artist led Hotel was born but the
idea for this space if that
accommodation would be one part of it
how could a space like a hotel better
serve not only artists who are in the
city those who are visiting those who
are interested and passionate about the
culture of Birmingham those who want to
shape physical spaces together so it
might combine accommodation with spaces
for the community to just be to hang out
to chill to eat it will combine spaces
that artists can develop working present
working and forge new connections with
each other given that we have so many
incredible venues and we&#39;re standing in
one today so many venues so many
programmers so many festivals and this
is constant influx of artists we can
already hear there are a few here in the
room today wouldn&#39;t it make sense to
have a space that centralized that can
serve them and this idea of artists
working in civic space it&#39;s not new in
fact we only need to look at somebody
like Theaster gates my idol he&#39;s a
Chicago based sculptor ceramicist Potter
and he talks about his extract Asst as
going from shaping clay to shape and
buildings and he transforms a building
in his neighborhood a block in his
neighborhood the whole neighborhood and
now he&#39;s looking at the district and the
place of Chicago or closer to home we
have places like East Side projects who
are working on affordable housing and
looking at what that means for the city
and communities of artists I don&#39;t know
if you&#39;ve noticed Birmingham if you&#39;ve
got artist friend
you may be familiar with that I&#39;ve got
no money syndrome what can we actually
do about it together and how might we
better equip each other and share
resources to make that not a problem
anymore so the artist hotel it&#39;s gonna
take all of us as I said before I&#39;m
really Mike Mike Mike a skier is that we
can find better way to support each
other in making our ideas happen I think
that in order for this to really thrive
it&#39;s gonna take citizens it&#39;s gonna take
art it&#39;s gonna take the whole community
and we&#39;ve heard some ideas today about
what that might look like but we need to
build together and I think you know we
get this right then we can talk about
all the other stuff right because we get
a lot of problems guys we could talk
about how artists might set up their own
financial systems banks artists led by
guys I can&#39;t get a mortgage basically I
need something you know the artist will
understand the self-employed will
understand it&#39;s a struggle what my
artists said outdoor and green spaces
look like in Birmingham City Center we
need to keep the green in as many places
as possible what might that look like
what my artists LED systems look like
and how might we actually find ways to
support artists to bed to better support
artists and solve some of the issues
that are already happening in the city
what would an artist that intervention
look like around homelessness and
housing what would it look like about
children services some about some of our
other major challenges institutionalized
racism prejudice
what if artists were to be supported in
solving some of those issues with
everybody else so I just like to invite
you all to think about how you might be
open to working with artists because
we&#39;re already doing this stuff anyway to
be honest guys we just need to better
form connections with each other
while I&#39;m here I just want to say one
final thing on behalf of all the artists
pay artists book artists go and see
artists work tell your friends about
artists pay artists pay artists pay
artists pay artists practice thank you
