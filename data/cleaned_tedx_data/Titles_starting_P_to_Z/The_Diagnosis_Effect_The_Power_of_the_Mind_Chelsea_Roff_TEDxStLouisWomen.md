14 years old diagnosed with anorexia
nervosa this is a 14 year old young
woman who had an eating disorder you
this was about a year before her weight
fell to 58 pounds one year before her
mother drove her to an emergency room
after she passed out and one year before
a doctor came into that emergency room
and explained that her oldest daughter
may only have a few more days to live
you might not recognize her but the girl
in that picture is me the doctor hadn&#39;t
been exaggerating I was dying
nearly every system in my body was
shutting down a valve in my heart was
leaking my skin was yellow from liver
failure I&#39;d lost so much muscle tone in
my bladder that I was I was in diapers
the doctors were alarmed at my at my
condition so they called Child
Protective Services a judge deemed my
mother and unfit parents and I&#39;ve got to
take a breath
a judge deemed my brother an unfit
parent and the hospital was given
guardianship which ended up being a
blessing in disguise I spent 18 months
in the hospital the doctors and nurses
became my foster family so a year and a
half later when I left you would think I
would be better you would think all
right 18 months you would think that
would do enough but it wasn&#39;t when I
left the hospital I was on 14 different
medications about half of which for
psychiatric drugs I was in a body that
was twice the size of what it had been
when I went in and I was still
underweight I was having panic attacks
and I was having bouts of depression
I had a long way to go four years after
I kept my past a secret I was ashamed I
thought if anybody ever knew about my
illness they would judge me and they
would thank me a lesser human being I
also didn&#39;t have a lot of hope about the
future I&#39;ve been told by therapists that
eating disorders are chronic conditions
and that I should be vigilant of a
relapse I had met women in the hospital
who had had eating disorders for more
than 30 years they told me it never
completely goes away the year after I
left the hospital I decided to go to
university to
study neuroscience I wanted to figure
out what had gone so wrong in my brain I
wanted to understand what in the brain
causes mental illness how had I gotten
so sick one of the first things I
learned is that neuroscience doesn&#39;t
have a lot of good answers to that
question I had wrongly assumed like many
others that mental illness comes from
chemical imbalances in the brain but it
turns out that theory has been debunked
for decades researchers widely agree
that there&#39;s very little evidence to
suggest serotonin depression Orman&#39;s
other mental illnesses comes from a lack
of serotonin in fact we can&#39;t use
biomarkers to diagnose any mental
illness so what that means is you can&#39;t
do a blood test to figure out if
somebody has schizophrenia or you can&#39;t
you can&#39;t test 20 people&#39;s brains and
figure out which one is depressed that&#39;s
not to say mental illness is not real
but psychiatric diagnoses are based on
clusters of symptoms not but not
chemical imbalances or broken circuits
another thing I&#39;d assumed I always
thought that mental illness was was a
disease like I&#39;d heard addiction was a
disease and and depression was a disease
but it turns out again that I was wrong
they&#39;re not diseases they&#39;re disorders
and while many of us use these terms
interchangeably they actually have
different meanings a disease is when
something goes wrong and you can
identify the biological process that&#39;s
causing it so cancer for example is a
disease of unchecked cell growth a
disorder on the other hand is when
something goes wrong but we can tie pin
point or identify the exact biological
process that&#39;s causing it sometimes
disorders turn out to be diseases but
sometimes they&#39;re caused by other
factors it&#39;s a less precise diagnosis
now while I was busy searching for the
causes of mental illness I was still
trying to reconcile my own challenges a
couple months after my 20th birthday my
biological mother was diagnosed with
Warnecke Korsakoff syndrome alcohol
induced dementia things got rough I
started to slip back into old patterns
of starving and sleeping the days away I
called the doctor who had been in charge
of my care to see if I could come in for
a visit
I trusted him I broke down I said
I hate my life and I hate myself I feel
like I&#39;ve got a broken body and a broken
family and a broken brain and I&#39;m gonna
struggle with this forever and I&#39;m tired
I don&#39;t want to do it anymore he said to
me something I will never forget he said
she&#39;ll see you&#39;re not broken and you&#39;re
not always gonna struggle with this
you&#39;re struggling with it now and that&#39;s
okay you will not always have an eating
disorder I know you you can integrate
this into who you are and you will be a
better person because of it those words
changed my life up until that moment I
had never even considered the
possibility of not having an eating
disorder I mean I was hopeful for
recovery sure but to me recovery didn&#39;t
mean being free of an eating disorder
it meant managing it it meant looking in
the mirror for the rest of my life and
hating my body but not acting on the
thoughts in looking at a plate of food
and not wanting to eat but eating it
anyway
my diagnosis had come to shape how I saw
myself and how I thought about the
future and the future until that moment
was bleak now today I run a nonprofit
organization that helps people overcome
mental health challenges I&#39;ve been on
both sides of the system I spent my
childhood as a patient in the system and
I&#39;ve spent my adult life helping people
overcome these challenges I&#39;ve heard
stories from thousands of people dealing
with everything from anorexia to opiate
addiction to schizophrenia and one thing
I hear over and over again is that they
believe they have a disease they&#39;ll
struggle with the rest of their lives
and they don&#39;t just get that idea from
medical professionals often it&#39;s
expressed most ardently from the people
around them from fellow sufferers I&#39;ve
started to wonder what if that idea
might keep people sick and what if the
opposite idea that mental health
challenges are normal and that
overcoming them is not only possible but
probable could help people get better
now back at university I was research
for these causes was not going well I
kept getting sidetracked I was in class
one day and a professor was giving a
lecture on a controversial
this that suggested antidepressants work
no better than placebo now I was
skeptical I raised my hand and I was
like I&#39;m I&#39;m sorry but if
antidepressants don&#39;t work how do you
explain the fact that hundreds of
thousands of people if not millions of
people report positive benefits like
maybe this researchers methodology was
flawed maybe he cherry picked his data
to justify his own conclusion
the professor smiled he said Chelsea
he&#39;s not saying antidepressants don&#39;t
work he&#39;s saying that the placebo effect
works just as well
that&#39;s floored me like how is that even
possible how could the mind to create
those types of benefits that doesn&#39;t
make any sense and so I got obsessed I
just inhaled the research on the placebo
effect for a while my favorite study
compared a group of a hundred and fifty
patients who had torn their meniscus so
it looked at knee surgery versus placebo
in a group of this these patients who&#39;d
hadn&#39;t eaten
eat me and injury half of the patients
underwent the real surgery the other
half merely had their knees cut open and
sewn right back up nobody knew whether
they were getting the real surgery or
not yep yep okay it gets better
so so the results though were
extraordinary one year later no one
knows whether they&#39;re gonna get the real
surgery one year later the people who
got the fake surgery were we&#39;re walking
better than the people who got the real
surgery two years later no difference
between the groups at all so the way
this was reported in the press is don&#39;t
do knee surgery knee surgery doesn&#39;t
work which is okay I mean I guess you
could you could extrapolate that from
that but it wasn&#39;t that the knee surgery
didn&#39;t work it was that both the placebo
and the knee surgery worked both caught
both cabbies made these patients walk
better and have reduced pain I mean
that&#39;s amazing okay so you might think
in your head okay so the placebo is when
you can think yourself into feeling
better right that that makes sense
except it&#39;s not that simple it&#39;s not
just in your head so there was another
study that found oh I love this one it
found a saline injection so saltwater a
saline injection not only improves motor
skills for people with Parkinson&#39;s
disease it also makes these patients
produce more dopamine the very
neurotransmitter Parkinson&#39;s disease
destroys to begin with it gets better
you can increase the effectiveness of a
placebo simply and how you deliver it so
in most cases the larger the pill the
stronger the effect two pills work
better than one injections work better
than pills surgeries work better than
injections there is even evidence to
suggest that the color of the pill makes
a difference so colored pills reduce
pain more than white pills blue pills
will help you sleep better than red
pills green pills are particularly
effective at reducing anxiety which is
why I should have taken the green pill
all of this tells us something very very
important about the mind in medicine our
minds and in particular our beliefs and
expectations can help us get better but
it turns out our minds can also make us
sick so I soon stumbled onto the
placebos evil cousin a nocebo effect the
nocebo effect is basically the opposite
of the placebo effect just as positive
positive expectations can invoke the
body&#39;s innate capacity for healing
negative expectations can cause side
effects and symptoms to arise so if I
were to give you a pill right now and
say be careful this might cause you to
break out in a rash you might really
rake out in a rash despite the fact that
it&#39;s a sugar pill I mean that&#39;s amazing
right there was there was a case study
there&#39;s a case study of a guy who
managed to overdose on sugar pills he
was he was in an antidepressant drug
trial and he was rushed to the hospital
one night with rapidly dropping blood
pressure he&#39;d he&#39;d had a suicide attempt
only to find a few hours later that the
medication he had overdosed on had been
a placebo despite the fact that he&#39;d
taken 29 sugar pills his body responded
as if the pills had been real I know
this blows my mind and it blew my mind
then too because I started to think if a
placebo can make you bad
and at nocebo can make you sick could a
diagnosis cause a similar phenomenon
could a diagnosis of mental illness
cause negative effects this brought me
to what I&#39;ve come to think of as the
diagnosis effect today I want to suggest
that some of the ill effects we
associate with mental illness with
mental disorders aren&#39;t just due to the
disorder itself but to the beliefs and
behaviors that emerge from a person and
those around them in response to the
diagnosis I it&#39;s it&#39;s not just that the
belief you have an illness makes you
sick it&#39;s that a diagnosis and in
particular the narrative that comes
along with a psychiatric one changes how
you think and feel about yourself that
in term in turn changes how you act and
those changes over time can extend and
turn up the volume on the very problem
you had to begin with I see this happen
in my patients all the time my clients
all the time they my number one job my
number one job and we can&#39;t get to
anything else until this is done is to
help them release the deep-seated belief
that they&#39;re broken and that they will
never get better to help them start to
imagine a different a more humane a more
expansive vision of who they are how
they&#39;ve come to develop these ways of
coping and what&#39;s possible for them in
the future
diagnosis become part and parcel with
identity you&#39;re not just a person who&#39;s
learned to cope with alcohol you&#39;re an
alcoholic you&#39;re not just a person who
hears voices you are a schizophrenic
those labels change how you feel about
yourself and how you relate to others I
saw this in my own experience I felt
broken I didn&#39;t date because I thought I
was too unstable for a relationship I
didn&#39;t go out for beers with friends
because I was told eating disorders are
another form of addiction and if you&#39;re
not careful you&#39;ll become an alcoholic I
didn&#39;t travel because I thought I was
too fragile which is funny now because I
spend most of my life on the road I it
seems silly but back then I didn&#39;t
question it it was the narrative I&#39;ve
adopted with my diagnosis I am NOT
saying that these illnesses aren&#39;t real
not at all what I&#39;m suggesting is that
the these illnesses are made worse by
the narratives that come along with them
when we talk about mental illness as a
chronic unrelenting disease when we talk
about people as powerless when we
suggest without good evidence that these
people are doomed to a poor prognosis we
turn a person&#39;s own mind against them
now at this point you&#39;re like you might
be thinking okay so are you suggesting
that we just do away with diagnosis
altogether like that&#39;s an interesting
idea I&#39;m not suggesting that I mean can
you imagine what would have happened if
my mom had wheeled me into that into
that emergency room and and the doctor
had said oh well something definitely
appears to be wrong but I don&#39;t want to
tell you what it is because I might make
it worse no a diagnosis can help medical
professionals identify a problem and
plan an effective course of treatment
I&#39;m also not suggesting that we should
simply think more positive about mental
illness I mean wouldn&#39;t that be a mess
you walk into a psychiatrist&#39;s office
tell her you&#39;re thinking about taking
your own life and she says you really
just need to look on the bright side
like this mental illness thing is all in
your head NoHo negative expectations can
make us sick but it doesn&#39;t follow that
positive expectations alone will make us
better if it was that simple if it was
as simple as that we would have solved
our mental health crisis a long time ago
my doctor years ago gave me a key he
shared his belief in my ability to get
better I needed to believe it myself to
walk through the door it wasn&#39;t long
after that I took up the practice of
meditation and it was in meditation I
had a life-changing realization for
years I had felt like a passive observer
in my life it was like I was in a car
and I was definitely in the driver&#39;s
seat but I wasn&#39;t holding on to the
wheel and I didn&#39;t even know there was a
wheel to be honest with you it was like
why is this car going all over the road
and I was sitting there in meditation
and I realized oh my gosh this is my
mind these are my thoughts I can
redirect them I can take the wheel and
redirect the car in fact I&#39;m the only
one in here I&#39;m the only one who can
this is a concept social scientists call
agent scene agency if you&#39;ve never heard
this term before is your felt sense of
ability to influence your thoughts
feelings and actions
it&#39;s the feeling you&#39;re in the driver&#39;s
seat of your own life it&#39;s agency not
positive expectations that&#39;s the
antidote to the diagnosis effect agency
takes positive expectations one step
further it&#39;s not about believing
something good will happen to you it&#39;s
about believing you have the capacity to
bring something good about it takes the
it takes the placebo effect one step
further it&#39;s not about believing
something good will happen oh I just
said that
leaving you have the ability to bring
something good about the reason I think
mental illness is so intractable is that
it hijacks a person&#39;s sense of agency
it&#39;s not that people don&#39;t want to get
better it&#39;s that they don&#39;t feel that
they can and here&#39;s the thing our
prevailing narrative of mental illness
runs in direct opposition to building a
sense of agency it says this is
happening to you you have a disease you
can&#39;t trust your mind
that&#39;s so problematic because in my
experience overcoming mental health
challenges is an active process it
requires your participation it requires
more than anything you trust your own
mind I mentioned earlier I now run a
non-profit and if you&#39;re thinking this
agency thing sounds good but what would
that even look like I want to give you
three things three things I&#39;ve seen work
in the nonprofit one is mentorship
surround the person who&#39;s struggling
with living breathing examples that
overcoming these challenges is possible
don&#39;t just surround sick people with
sick people to is mindfulness teach the
person practical skills for managing
their own mind yoga meditation work very
well and they don&#39;t have side effects
which is awesome yoga and meditation are
no panacea but they can help traditional
treatment work better last but not least
service get the person involved in
volunteering and service activities
immediately this gives them a lived
experience of their ability to have an
influence to make an impact not only on
their own life but on someone else&#39;s
this is why I&#39;m standing on this stage
today it&#39;s time we turn away from the
idea that people with mental illness are
sick and diseased and it&#39;s time we turn
toward the idea it&#39;s time that we turn
turn toward a more expansive a more
humane a more nuanced vision of the mind
and what it&#39;s possible what&#39;s possible
thank you
