hi everyone my name is Kimberly rich and
today I&#39;m going to be talking with you
about something
that we&#39;re all very familiar with yet
simultaneously we&#39;re all trying to avoid
and that is regret in 1986 a group of
researchers at Cornell University
conducted a study to better understand
how and why we experience regret more
specifically they wanted to know which
caused greater feelings of regret things
that we did or things that we wished
we&#39;ve done they interviewed over 600
people in their 70s and asked if you
could live your life over again what
would you do differently while 12%
listed the things that they had done
things that they regretted doing a
whopping 54% described all the things
that they wished they had done all the
opportunities that they had missed out
on so why this discrepancy well what
they found was that the regret we feel
for things that we&#39;ve done though in
tents only lasts a short period of time
weeks maybe months but the regret that
we feel for things that we missed out on
that can extend throughout a lifetime so
statistically speaking more than half of
you will get to the end of your life
still feeling regret for all the things
you didn&#39;t do why why is this such a
common problem well the simple answer
because most of us are scared and we
choose to lead an easy life we choose to
take the safe path and by doing so we
start to rack up those regrets but there
is a solution to lead a fulfilling
regret free life you just have to be
willing to do one thing you have to be
willing to be bold when I first had this
realization that boldness was so
integral to finding fulfillment I
devoted my life to spreading this
message
I read book after book and attended
seminar
and ultimately I started coaching people
on how they too could embody a bolder
lifestyle I&#39;ve spent the past two years
interviewing inspiring individuals for
my podcast people who have been able to
create adventurous regret free lives
based on this one common theme embracing
their inner boldness but before I tell
you how you can start to be bolder in
your life I need to tell you how I got
to this place
because trust me I was not always living
lessly
like most people in our society I
believe that life looks like this you go
to high school then college and you get
a job find a mate buy a house make a
baby and live happily ever after
it seems pretty easy right well I gave
it my best attempt I graduated college
in 2008 which as you may remember was
the best possible time that one could
hope to be getting a job so to be safe I
took the first job that was offered to
me and it ended up being the exact job I
said I would never do so for two and a
half years I made cold calls to
government employees and I&#39;m sure that
they were as thrilled about it as I was
about the same time that I got my dream
job I also got into a very safe
relationship with someone who was all
wrong for me we did the couple things we
went on vacations happy hours nice
dinners but there was little to no
passion and I stayed with him for a year
because I was too scared to leave
well the turning point came like most
big shifts in our life slowly and then
all at once I started taking risks first
by leaving the relationship and then
eventually the job and then at my next
employer I took another even bigger risk
by proposing an international remote
work agreement something that no one
else was asking for but ultimately the
biggest shift came when I read a little
book called the 4-hour workweek after
reading Tim Ferriss book I had hope and
I stopped believing that I was stuck
feeling overworked and under travelled
for the rest of my life I stopped
believing that I was stuck driving an
hour long
every day for the rest of my life and in
2013 just four months after reading this
book through a series of very bold
decisions I quit my corporate job and I
moved overseas I spent the next two
years traveling all over Europe and
Southeast Asia working anywhere that had
a decent Wi-Fi connection
I studied things like internet
entrepreneurship which eventually led me
to personal development which led me to
my business the bold life movement and
ultimately to the stage what I hope you
can see though is that this was a
process that took time the bold moves
that I made evolved over the years with
every risk that I took my comfort zone
expanded and with every bold action I
eliminated the potential for those
future feelings of regret today we&#39;re
going to talk about how you can do the
same and I&#39;ll share with you three
secrets that I&#39;ve uncovered through
hundreds of hours of research and
interviews and years of personally
living these truths myself so to avoid
regret number one ask for what you want
the quickest and easiest way to start
getting what you want is to have the
audacity to ask for it this space seems
so obvious and so simple but for some
people asking for what they want is as
terrifying as getting up on stage in
front of a large crowd but the truth is
that we don&#39;t know what seemingly out of
reach things can start to become within
our grasp until we start to ask I&#39;ll
share with you a personal story my mom
somehow became a huge fan of an
australian-based
TV show unfortunately the producers of
this show know that without their fans
it just wouldn&#39;t be as successful so
throughout the year they host these
different events where the fans and the
actors can come together she has taken
full advantage of this and flown all the
way to Australia more times than I can
count so for her birthday last year I
thought it would be a really great gift
if I could get the actor in the show to
send her a happy birthday message I knew
it was a big stretch but I figured what
do I have to lose
so the day before her birthday I logged
into Instagram I opened a private
message to him I sat there for about ten
minutes with my finger hovering over the
record button because I was very nervous
and then eventually I recorded a video
and hit Send the next day I couldn&#39;t
believe when his message came through
not only had he actually responded to me
but he had sent the most thoughtful
video ever
fortunately she and I happened to be
skyping at the time and I was able to
capture her reaction take a look she&#39;s
so happy right hopefully you can see how
being bold enough to ask for what you
want doesn&#39;t just benefit you it can
benefit the people in your life too the
interesting thing is that most of us
underestimate how likely people are to
say yes a recent study at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business illustrates
this point really well they had
participants go out with the goal of
getting five strangers to complete a
short questionnaire they also asked the
participants to estimate how many people
they&#39;d have to approach to reach this
goal well most of the participants
overestimated how many people it would
take in fact they thought it would take
twice as many as it did to get those
five signatures on average participants
only needed to ask about 10 people
that&#39;s a 50% success rate which is
comparable to what had been seen in
other studies so if you are
three percent more likely to get what
you want just by asking why would you
forego that opportunity it could be as
simple as asking the barista to fix your
coffee order because they messed it up
or asking for an upgraded seat on your
next flight
it could be asking your boss for the
afternoon off
simply because you need a mental-health
day having the audacity to ask for what
you want doesn&#39;t make you an asshole
being bold doesn&#39;t make you a bad person
at the end of every podcast episode I
asked my guests to tell me what their
definition of leading a bold life is one
of my favorite all-time responses came
from former lawyer turned travel writer
and food blogger Jody Attenberg Jody
said being bold is different from being
brash there&#39;s a subtlety and a roundness
to being bold that is classy it means
being unapologetic about the things that
you love a life isn&#39;t it great it&#39;s not
aggressive it&#39;s confident if you&#39;re not
willing to ask for the small things how
are you gonna be willing to ask for the
things that really matter today it&#39;s a
better table at a restaurant but next
year it could mean having the guts to
ask your spouse to move your entire
family across the country for a job that
you really want to often we forgo asking
for what we want because we&#39;re scared of
being budged we&#39;re scared of imposing or
we&#39;re scared of being told no news flash
if you don&#39;t ask the answer is always no
and here&#39;s a pro tip sometimes the best
possible time to ask is after you&#39;ve
already heard that initial now one of my
favorite personal examples of what can
happen when you were free refused to
take no for an answer came when my dad
was discharged from the US Air Force
halfway through Officer Training School
now you should know that my dad spent
his entire life preparing to be a pilot
in the Air Force he got his pilot&#39;s
license at 16 he graduated college in
three
with a degree in aviation and he a s--t
all of his aptitude tests but halfway
through training they faced an overage
of officers so they changed their
policies and made some cuts well my dad
being a very reasonable man decided to
write a letter to the person in charge
of the entire military if you don&#39;t know
that person is the commander in chief
sometimes called the President of the
United States his bold letter to
President Ford earned him a phone call
from the Pentagon just a few days later
and within four years my dad had been
reinstated he had completed Officer
Training School and he had earned his
wings he spent the next 23 years serving
his country and living out his dream
what dream are you giving up because
you&#39;re so willing to accept no as the
answer or worse not make the ask at all
to avoid regret you have to be bold so
ask for the little things ask for the
big things as for the things that no one
else is asking for you never know what
people will be willing to say yes to
until you give them the chance the
second way to avoid regret is to think
different in the 90s Apple nailed it
with their think different ad campaign
because they weren&#39;t just improving the
way that we listen to music or the way
we use computers they were creating an
entirely new way of doing it they were
willing to think outside the box and to
challenge the status quo to get what
they wanted and ultimately if you want
to get what you want you have to be
willing to do the same last year one of
my favorite authors and bloggers Chris
Guillebeau came through Austin on a book
signing tour I was determined to show
him my appreciation for his work when it
came time for him to sign my book now I
knew the best way to do that was to just
be myself and to accept that that meant
being a bit different from everyone else
in line for me the most authentic form
of appreciation is a handmade gift so I
made Chris a watercolor illustrating all
the ways that his work
had impacted my life naturally I was
terrified to give it to him because I
didn&#39;t want him to think I was some
wacko fan but when it came time for him
to sign my book I jumped up I was the
first person in line too nervous to eat
and in the end he was so touched and so
taken aback by the gesture that he ended
up asking me for my contact information
by thinking differently about that
opportunity I was able to leverage it
far beyond what I ever could have
imagined
since then chris has been a guest on my
podcast and last year he even invited me
to host a session at his annual
conference to avoid regret you have to
be bold if you want to create
opportunities in your life be willing to
think differently be willing to
challenge the status quo and be willing
to stand out the third and final secret
to avoiding regret is to trust your gut
only you know what is best for you and
if you want to lead a fulfilling and
authentic life then you need to be
willing to fulfill your dreams and
desires no matter what anyone else in
your life
thinks says or would do let me share
with you a personal story that may
surprise you when I was in high school I
used to spend a lot of time on AOL
Instant Messenger so much time in fact
that I ended up meeting a long-distance
boyfriend and falling in love
we lived 3,000 miles apart on opposite
sides of the country but because my dad
was a pilot I had flight benefits and we
were able to make it work keep in mind
though this is pre tender pre online
dating and I was in high school so this
was very taboo for the times but we had
connected over instant messenger and
fallen in love over the phone and we
even took it as far as going to prom
together when we went off to college
things ended on somewhat of a sour note
and for years I thought he hated me and
didn&#39;t know why for years I wanted
closure because I&#39;m a human fast forward
to 2015
tenure
later I found myself in his hometown
attending a conference this was the
first time I had been back since I was
17 so I looked him up at first I took
the usual routes Facebook found nothing
Instagram
nothing Twitter Linkedin Google all dead
ends according to the internet he was
virtually non-existent it wasn&#39;t until I
found a single Google image posted by
his then employer did my luck sir change
but there was no email address so I
decided to pay him a visit at his office
if alarm bells are ringing in your head
and red flags are flying in front of
your face that&#39;s probably a very normal
reaction but I wasn&#39;t concerned with
being normal I was on a mission I
somehow convinced a good friend to come
with me as moral support and to get
myself pumped up we blasted I have the
tiger in our rental car as we drove down
the street to his office I was
completely terrified but I also figured
what&#39;s the worst that could happen if
nothing it will make for a very good
story that unexpected drop-in ended up
being one of the best things that&#39;s ever
happened to me of course he was shocked
but he didn&#39;t call the cops no in the
end he was thrilled and we spent hours
reconnecting any negativity once felt
was a distant memory I knew in my heart
that that reunion would be positive but
I never could have known how much it
would change my life the story of that
encounter ended up being the first blog
post on my website the bold life
movement which has since turned into a
coaching business a podcast and soon a
book when your heart tells you to do
something listen if the only thing
keeping you from taking action is fear
of judgment or failure or rejection I
encourage you to move through it because
trust me all of those people that you
think are going to judge you
they won&#39;t be around when your
70s or 80s looking back on your life
wishing that you had seized those
opportunities to avoid regret you have
to be bold so whether it&#39;s a new
business a new job a new romantic
partner or an old one trust your gut
because believe me you&#39;ll never be able
to please everyone else anyway so if
you&#39;re waiting for permission this is it
no matter what the outcome is action
always breeds clarity and failure is
just another form of feedback so
remember that regret is a choice and
that it&#39;s avoidable so be bold enough to
ask for what you want be brave enough to
think differently and always always
always trust your gut thank you
[Applause]
