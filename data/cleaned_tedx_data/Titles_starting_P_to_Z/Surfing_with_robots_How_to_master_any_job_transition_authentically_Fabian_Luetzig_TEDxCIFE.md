once upon a time there was this girl who
always had to work a lot because her
stepmother and her stepsister made her
on a particularly bad day she pricked
her finger with a spindle and blood was
all over her hands and they got slippery
in the spindle fell into the well the
mean stepmother said that she should
basically jump in after it to retrieve
it if she didn&#39;t have the money to pay
for a new one so in her desperation she
did she jumped down and she passed out
on the way down when she woke up she
woke up in a strange land and she
started walking and came to a house the
house belonged to an old woman it turned
out to be foul holla holla after
listening to the plight of a girl
offered to employ her as her maid in
order to for her to make more money and
and maybe buy a new spindle the girl was
grateful and said yes and did everything
that for Hollow asked of her and more so
she scrubbed the floor she cleaned the
windows and she shook the feather
pillows really help after a time she
grew homesick and she asked to be
released from for hala service so father
said ok she led her to a gate and she
said step through here and repr just
rewards so when the girl stepped through
she was showered in gold and henceforth
she was called gold Mary now when she
came home she was of course received
with open arms and rich as she was
because the stepmother wanted to know
where all this pretty gold came from so
when she heard about gold Mary&#39;s
experiences she told the stepsister dugu
the same thing right away so down the
well the ZipZap sister went woke up in a
strange land went to father&#39;s door and
demanded to be employed as a maid was
granted a wish and so she did what was
just what she was supposed to do she
scrubbed the floor she cleaned the
window she shook the feather pillows
I was a lot of work and the next day she
had to do it again
I was even more work and she just didn&#39;t
want to do it really and her performance
dropped and she did a poor job and at
some point she didn&#39;t even really get up
out of bed anymore so that&#39;s one for all
I decided it&#39;s time for her to collect
her reward
and so she led her to the gateway and
said step right through and collect your
reward and so the girl went through the
doorway and was covered in pitch in tar
the sticky black stuff that would never
ever come out of her clothing again of
her hair of her skin and she would
forever live with that shame of being
called pitch marry for generations
German parents have been telling this
fairy tale to their children so that
they would clean up their rooms without
complaining to me it actually
encapsulates quite a lot of what I have
found to be true about happiness and
engagement in the workplace I think
about it it&#39;s not true that success
comes first and only for successful then
we&#39;re happy and we&#39;re engaged like pitch
marry thought it&#39;s the opposite it&#39;s
those people that are engaged that are
happy with what they&#39;re doing that go
above and beyond because they really
believe in what they&#39;re doing those are
the people that become successful like
gold marry money is a strong
motivational factor only up unto a
certain saturation point and above that
the law of diminishing returns kicks in
and additional money won&#39;t want to beat
you at all anymore what I have found is
important instead and of course this
differs by every individual but sort of
a common denominator is that the person
feels like the work that they&#39;re doing
is making an impact it&#39;s making a
difference and that they&#39;re given a
certain degree of Independence to do the
job in
the way that they think is the best way
to do it and don&#39;t just take my word for
it Amy Rosinski from the Yale School of
Management and AB psychologist named
shawn Achor
they have come to pretty much the same
conclusion in their work it&#39;s okay the
difference between fairy tales and real
life though is that in fairy tales the
characters the good ones they get to
live happily ever after right in reality
life always comes up with the next
challenge for us to master with the next
transition for us to go through so let&#39;s
assume that you achieved gold marry
status in your current occupation what
do you do if it&#39;s taken away from you
how do you maintain this positive can-do
attitude of wanting to show up as the
best you every day in life and in work
if there&#39;s a transition forced on you
that you&#39;re not in control of and to
make that a little more palpable let&#39;s
talk about a wave of change that has
already appeared on the horizon and it&#39;s
rolling towards us right now the fourth
Industrial Revolution industry 4.0
meaning the increasing capacity of
machines to perform in jobs that have
heretofore only been performed by humans
so how big of a deal is that
well according to Pew Research about
two-thirds of American adults estimate
that pretty much all the tasks that we
do on a day-to-day basis at work will be
taken over by artificial intelligence by
machines within about 50 years but then
again there&#39;s other studies that show 80
percent of work is saying other jobs
maybe my job it&#39;s too special it&#39;s too
complicated machines can&#39;t do that now
and in 50 years only human can do that
so obviously there&#39;s a there&#39;s a certain
disconnect that doesn&#39;t quite fit
together okay so that&#39;s the layman&#39;s
opinion
what about experts in the field of
artificial intelligence
on this graphic you see the answers AI
experts have given to the question of
when do you think machines will be able
to outperform humans in these fields in
these job fields and there are some
answers in there that might feel quite
intuitive so for example we&#39;re looking
at maybe five to six years until
machines can fold laundry better awesome
here scripted interactions with humans
on the phone as a as a telephone banking
clerk for example seven years artificial
truck drivers are slated to outperform
the human counterparts in about 12 years
but the important thing is that we&#39;re
not only talking about low-skilled jobs
here we&#39;re also talking about mid-level
management we&#39;re talking about lawyers
we&#39;re talking about surgeons we&#39;re
talking even about best-selling book
authors who&#39;s waiting with me anxiously
for the next game of Thrones novel yeah
well one fellow fan didn&#39;t want to wait
any more and he fed all the existing
books to a special kind of artificial
intelligence that&#39;s called a recurrent
neural network and it came back with its
best guess on what the first chapters of
the next book might look like and it&#39;s a
fascinating read you can read it up on
github it&#39;s not a very good read as of
yet it&#39;s it&#39;s not hardly even
intelligible but it just shows you that
artificial intelligence can make great
headway it can move into spheres of
influence into jobs that we wouldn&#39;t
have naturally thought that that there
would be any place for it and so while
this dynamic is going on experts aren&#39;t
quite sure whether overall in the
balance this revolution will create more
jobs and destroys or destroy more jobs
that creates but wherever this scale
ends up the jobs that will be created
will be significantly different from the
jobs that will have been destroyed for
example who even heard of search engine
optimization as a job ten to fifteen
years ago who would have thought it
would be good idea to get into that
and so we&#39;re not gonna know what comes
next either now to that credit 87% of
American workers state that they
recognize that they will have to go
through training throughout their career
in order to keep up with changes in the
workplace but just keeping up with the
changes in Excel 2028 it&#39;s not going to
be enough and there is a strong body of
evidence that shows us that we as humans
tend to severely underestimate the
capacity of the world for change and our
own capacity for change and that&#39;s
especially true when that change relates
to us ourselves and you can even see
that in that graphic we were talking
about what job field do you think AI
research were saying that&#39;s a special
job field only humans can do this for
let&#39;s say the next 80 to 200 years hey
eye researchers so obviously industry
4.0 asks a lot of questions that we have
to find an answer to as society as a
whole but for the rest of this talk
let&#39;s focus on how an individual can
cope with a transition that is so
massive and that they are not in charge
of and to a lot of people who are young
professionals today or students today
this might actually happen several times
throughout their careers so with me
being a coach it might not come as a as
an utter shock to you that I that this
looks sounds and feels like coaching
challenge to me and just a very brief
background the type of coaching that I
do is based on the teachings and the
research of Milton Erickson who was a
psychiatrist and so much more and one of
his students
Marilyn Atkinson who founded the
ericksonian school of coaching and who
have had the great pleasure and honor of
meeting a couple of weeks ago one of the
basic principles of this type of
coaching is that change is inevitable
that means it&#39;s neither good nor bad
it&#39;s a fact and in order to cope with
change it is very helpful to embrace it
as such as a fact and to accept it now
obviously that&#39;s easily said and not as
easily done and in order to explain how
I propose to do it I would propose a
metaphor and that metaphor that I would
propose for a huge transition of this
kind and and many other kinds of
transition is surfing I&#39;ve recently had
my first surf lesson and I have a solid
80 minutes of practical experience so
who better than me to introduce you to
the world of surfing so obviously you
can&#39;t catch any great waves from this
from the beach on the sand so what you
have to do is you get on your belly and
you paddle out and you swim and you
might drink a lot of ocean water on the
way and it doesn&#39;t look elegant and it
doesn&#39;t look pretty but that&#39;s kind of
the price of admission if you want to if
you&#39;re gonna get to where the action is
and once you&#39;re out there you can&#39;t just
hit a button and have the perfect wave
come and take you away instead you look
around and you you analyze the waves and
you just see you try to anticipate where
that next wave might be coming from and
if you have anticipated that you get out
ahead of it and you feel it swelling
under you and transferring its energy to
you and that&#39;s the moment where you pop
up from your frame of Tummie
up on your feet and that&#39;s when you take
control and you stand upright and you
can you can sort of choose the direction
to a certain degree and while you do
that what I&#39;ve learned what&#39;s very
important so there we&#39;re waiting we&#39;re
discovering our wave and now we popped
up and while we&#39;re doing that it&#39;s very
important to not look at what you&#39;re
doing you don&#39;t look at your feet you
don&#39;t look at the water you don&#39;t look
at your board you look at where you&#39;re
going you look at the beach well and you
look around and hope that you don&#39;t run
for anybody so you also look at the
other people but so you caught your wave
and you&#39;re looking at the beach and your
trust in your body to help get you there
you&#39;re having fun you&#39;re looking good
and eventually though every energy every
wave will lose its energy and the energy
will dissipate and you know that&#39;s what
happens when you and when you don&#39;t pay
attention eventually you end up back at
the beach and that&#39;s when the game
starts over again so you swim out there
and that&#39;s a lot like acquiring the
capabilities you need in order to do
what it is you set out to do in your
work life when you&#39;re out there looking
for the wave looking for something to
propel you to give you that energy
that&#39;s your values for me personally
right now it&#39;s authenticity courage
those are values that are very important
to me right now and when you pop up and
you take control you show who you are
you show what you stand for both in a
personal and a professional context and
when you look at the beach and you look
for the other people you look at what
impact you are having on other people in
your life
and your colleagues and your friends and
on the world in general and you look at
where it is that you want to end up
basically what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re
discovering your vision and discover
your vision is not I want to work for
the EU I want to work as a psychologist
discovering your vision goes deeper it&#39;s
about the impact the change that you
want to create in the world and when you
discover your vision everything else can
fall into place when you discover your
vision you know what role you play in
that bigger picture when you discover
your vision you know what values you
want to pursue in order to make that
reality and you know what capabilities
you need in order to get there in life
as in surfing there are many things that
you&#39;re not in control of
a robot a machine might actually take
your job from you one day a job that
you&#39;ve worked very hard for the job that
you were very good at but once you have
discovered your vision you know what is
really important to you and you will
have discovered that there are many ways
in order to achieve that vision never
just one you are not defined by the
things that you have been doing you can
define your own identity with the kind
of impact that you choose to have in the
future and with that mindset you will
develop the ownership and the
flexibility to master any transition and
what they do it with a coach or you do
it by yourself if you practice that
mindset and you master it then
eventually you will be surfing with
robots thank you
