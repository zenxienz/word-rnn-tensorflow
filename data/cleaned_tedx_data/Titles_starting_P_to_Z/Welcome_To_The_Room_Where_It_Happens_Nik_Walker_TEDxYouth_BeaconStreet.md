everybody my name is Nick Walker I&#39;m an
actor based in New York City and I am
talking to you today from the set of my
current occupation I&#39;m an actor in
Hamilton an American musical you could
see the set behind me you can see my boy
Robert practicing a little gun movement
over there so I&#39;ve been in New York for
about oh my god about ten years now
before I was in New York I was actually
a Boston boy from Brooklyn born and
raised went to Lincoln school Lincoln
lions what up then went to Brooklyn high
school and did a lot of theater over
there zoot suit Jews Christ Superstar
Merchant of Venice but you know right
now you&#39;re in probably my my favorite
place in Brooklyn which is the Lincoln
school Lincoln was a place that really
transformed me and just taught me a lot
about just not judging my art and doing
whatever I wanted to do to explore
whatever venues I wanted to explore and
it kind of very much helped to make me
the man I am today so in a way you guys
are in the room where it happens so over
here I have kind of a crazy job I&#39;m the
understudy for Aaron Burr George
Washington Hercules Mulligan and James
Madison and it&#39;s a huge challenge and a
huge rush and every time I have to go on
I have to know this show in and out and
and trusts the people that I&#39;m doing
with it with and just kind of go with
the flow
but I think that the best part of it is
it&#39;s just the energy that you get it&#39;s
like watching a really good TEDx talk
but times like a hundred but I hope that
TEDx Beacon Street today gives you just
a little taste of what uh what I go
through on a daily basis I hope that you
take the ideas that you hear today and
like our man Alexander Hamilton put
those ideas into action so I wish you
the best I hope you enjoy yourselves
and to these speakers today break legs
have fun you got this I&#39;ll see you guys
soon I
you
