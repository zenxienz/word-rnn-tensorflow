thank you let me share my story how I
realized all is well with my soul in one
famous interview Mother Teresa the
interviewer asked how do you pray
I listen was her response and what does
God say in return the interviewer asked
he listens was the answer consider the
great good that comes from listening
I believe listening for God is listening
with hope for life today I&#39;m advising
that you can best listen for life when
you learn to escape the harm from
fearing death my story explains why I
want to make this point as a physician I
have tried to practice what I preach
I&#39;ve lived a healthy lifestyle of moving
more eating less connecting with people
it&#39;s a recipe to live forever
however just about a year ago my belly
started aching and I became the color of
a pumpkin we thought gallbladder disease
was the diagnosis but when the surgeon
operated to remove my gallbladder she
discovered pancreatic cancer blocking my
bile duct since then I&#39;ve had over four
months of strong triple chemo therapy
two months of radiation therapy and
finally in May the doctors performed the
Whipple procedure they cut out the head
of the pancreas that had the cancer 1/3
of the stomach half of the bile duct a
foot or more of small intestine and a
big chunk of connective tissue that
included all of the lymph nodes in the
area here&#39;s the before and after there&#39;s
been some rough seas but I&#39;m recovering
in my case now I have something like a
50-50 chance of a cure and the same
chance that the Cancer will return and
bring about my death although in this
case I hope I have a few years
so I have a good reason to be doing some
thinking about my own death Frederic
Backman a Swedish author said in his
wonderful book a man called OVA and I
recommend it
death is a strange thing most people
lived their whole lives as if it doesn&#39;t
exist
I believe he&#39;s right I we pretend death
doesn&#39;t exist because many of us are
gut-wrenchingly terrified of it so why
are we so afraid
is this disabling dread from our
cultural habit of avoiding dying or dead
people in the hospital the nursing home
or the funeral is it because we don&#39;t
talk about death in conversations with
our children I ask you by keeping the
sad truth from our youth trying to make
life easier for them are we instead
filling them with the fear of death
isn&#39;t it true that the fear of the
unknown is almost always worse than
something familiar is it because people
of all ages have gotten used to such
advances in medicine that we expect
modern health care to save us from death
even in the face of terminal or aging
diseases even when all is futile or is
it because sometimes people who are
treated way beyond any chance of
recovery experienced such severe
suffering that when we see that
suffering we become even more fearful of
death fear is hardwired in our brains to
keep us from harm but fear can sometimes
make us turn and run away from a
rational approach to avoiding danger or
it can also cause complete paralysis
while dangers just smacks us flat in the
face I have helplessly watched some
patients fear of death bring on
suffering for exam
a 55 year old woman who had seen a
relative with breast cancer suffer
miserably was diagnosed with her own
breast cancer because of her fear of a
similar fate and despite my explanations
the woman avoided appropriate and
effective treatment resulting in her
death after less than a year her cancer
looked just like that was standard
acceptable and effective treatment she
likely would have had many years of
comfortable life which were lost
because of her fear another example a
forty five-year-old airplane pilot came
into the Atlanta VA hospital with back
pain when we diagnosed cancer of the
lung spread to the bones of his back he
sank into a black hole of funk and
sadness so deep that he avoided visits
from his family who loved him he
eventually slipped away alone still
immersed in regret panic and sadness
fear of death is not only dangerous it
can reduce the quality of the time you
have left
in contrast a 63 year old biology
professor from SDSU was discovered with
widely metastatic colon cancer years ago
and after failed chemo it was time to
enter hospice let him enjoy some time
and change the focus to comfort care he
loved his family his students and job
but as a biologist and a burger he loved
all living things and the world that
surrounds us his was the opposite of the
black hole
everyone everyone nearing this guy felt
his glowing spirit and his birdsong of
love when he died
he was surrounded by family and friends
spirited connection to the whole world
and all that&#39;s in it he died with
dignity pure class and grace so we come
back to my case first I need to share
with you some memories of my sister
Susan who died at 19 years of age she
taught me two powerful lessons when
Susan died in a car crash I was 16 just
returning from a Boy Scout canoe trip
I&#39;ll never forget the sadness of the
moment walking into our house filled
with what seemed like half the wonderful
town of De Smet caring loving to find my
mom and dad their grieving
there was near the end of that summer
but the beginning of a long period of
mourning for my family and me the first
lesson I realized how important support
from a community can be consolation came
from our friends our neighbors our
Community Church as well as people we
barely knew it was like the warm
feathers of a loving and experience
community wrapped around us it seemed
more like their presence than their
words that mattered the love of that
community gave me the strength and the
compassion and taught me give back to
others when people need help
second lesson her death changed how I
saw a life she was a person with such
zest so full of life
she did she did a Snoopy dance I mean
almost all of her day she loved life
life too for any of us might be brief or
shortened like hers and so it&#39;s so very
important to savor every moment
why shouldn&#39;t we cherish every day after
all what is the downside we&#39;re all going
to die enjoying every moment as well as
we can will not curry it on and fearing
death will not prevent it
I&#39;m not saying cover up the fear of
death with drugs or alcohol or pretend
celebration that might just bring death
sooner I am saying savor the moment I
don&#39;t know how it will be when I die but
I think as a physician I am aware and
prepared as any I have a lifetime of
caring for the aging or the very sick
who are near at the end of their lives
it&#39;s been my job all these years to help
them through the dying process
when it is inevitable I should add I
don&#39;t believe my profession always
provides enough comfort in these times
physicians and nurses are often
overzealous because they can be running
from their own fear of death too and of
course giving comfort can take time it&#39;s
simply easier just to do everything full
resuscitation full steam ahead
another take-home message of this talk
no matter what your age no matter what
your age you need all of you to talk to
your family about letting go when it&#39;s
time to die an official document is good
but the talking with your family is most
important although what happens after we
die is beyond understanding the
potential dangers of fearing death are
real whether you&#39;re an elderly person
dying from heart failure lung disease
pancreatic cancer or a perfectly healthy
younger person sitting comfortably in
your chair listening to a TEDx talk
here&#39;s another take home message by
facing your own eventual death you&#39;re
better prepared to live after hearing of
my cancer a psychologist Minister friend
of mine from afar wrote me and said how
is your soul with all of this and how
should I pray for you here is my answer
I would ask you pray that each one of us
learn to better see and accept our own
dying process and to let go of all that
fear and then we can learn to savor
every day every moment as for me my
faith surrounds me like the wings of a
mother hen I&#39;m okay with dying I&#39;m
trying to put it off as long as I can
but I&#39;ll be all right if it happened
sooner I am incredibly thankful for an
abundant life my job as a physician has
given back far more than I could ever
give I still love and play with gusto I
gather all the humor and fun I can have
with every juncture and I try to Snoopy
dance my dates every day I am surrounded
by dear friends the love of a wonderful
spouse and honest creative kids I direct
an interdenominational choir that sings
hymns weekly to people in need to help
them savor a moment
indeed I am I&#39;ve been listening as hard
as I can for life which helps me face my
own impending death I believe God is
listening and maybe Mother Teresa too
and I realize rough seas can still come
but all is well with my my soul
[Applause]
