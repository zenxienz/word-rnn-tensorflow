when I was 12 years old I&#39;ve sent a
letter to the Ministry of Education
wanting to see you my math teacher at
that time I hated math everything seemed
so complicated as she lack the ability
to make me and my colleagues understand
it of course I didn&#39;t sue her because
because of this but because she didn&#39;t
seem to like what she was doing she
didn&#39;t seem to have the skills or
ability to teach us math after months of
waiting for an answer because I wanted
to make a change and get her out of my
school I finally got an answer one of
those Steve and blond answers in no
solution so the wheel kept spinning
after high school I went to journalism
and communication University and started
working in different companies related
to the digital environment nothing
related to math as you can imagine when
I was 22 I discovered my passion for
teaching not math of course but English
I thought in the beginning it&#39;s going to
be a huge change in my life to become a
teacher but I accepted a challenge every
day I felt a lot of aasaiya tea I had a
lot of questions in my mind how am I
going to manage a classroom full of
children am I the right person for this
do I have enough patience how do I keep
them interested in what I teach after a
few months I felt from the bottom of my
heart that this is what I should do for
the rest of my life be around children
help them discover the future it took me
5 more years to finally embrace this as
my mission in life I wanted to be the
other side of my math teacher so what am
I doing differently now as
steam teacher I truly believe a steam
approach can engage students more and
change education as we know it these
days same sense for science technology
engineering art and mathematics put them
together and what do you get it&#39;s a new
vision to the world and your approach
that can change things for the better
and finally make a difference my passion
for teaching led me to create small
academy steam education hub with
Technology programming and robotics
classes for five to fourteen years old
children my goal goes beyond of just
using some fancy gadgets with some cool
names in our classes my goal is to help
to shape children&#39;s mindset towards a
global one to be able to find and solve
real problems from the real world and
generate an impact with their ideas to
technology programming and robotics
classes my goal is to help children
manage a project from from start to
finish iterate get feedback from real
users like it&#39;s happening in our day to
day life working in a company or
managing our own companies my goal is to
help children become creators inventors
not only consumers what started with 14
children in January this year now has
200 children and one summer school with
90 children it&#39;s been proven that
learning by doing it&#39;s a much more
powerful experience especially for
children this is why I use hands-on
activities in all my classes such as
inventing with easy to use electronic
building blocks and additional materials
creating robots assembling computers
that children can use for programming
creating objects with 3d printers and 3d
pants hands-on activities prepare
children for the future developing a new
set of skills very very useful in our
summer school this year during a week
for five weeks children
children from every team had a
brainstorming at the beginning of that
week they were thinking what prototype
to create by the end of the week based
on their own ideas so every Monday they
had a brainstorming to decide what
prototype to create they&#39;re thinking of
its functionalities decided what a
Minimum Viable Product should look like
had a research on what materials they
needed implemented their idea tested it
got feedback fixed bugs and iterated all
this again and again for instance in one
week one team created a multifunctional
robot who was a vacuum cleaner and a pet
in the same time so they used proximity
motion and light sensors to create this
invention an mp3 player speakers fans
and motors when nobody was at home the
robot was cleaning the room when
somebody was around the robot became a
pad another team came with a different
idea so they created a two-in-one
vehicle this one right here so it&#39;s a
boat and a car at the same time they
used plastic materials circuits to
create their invention so I think it&#39;s
time to change the old with the new it&#39;s
not enough to just brag about using
computers in school if they&#39;re just
furniture and not use adult food
capacity it&#39;s not enough to teach using
ancient programs that are no longer
relevant or times for instance in
September Apple launched Swift
playgrounds a platform that teaches
children the basics of programming until
now it was adopted by 100 institutions
worldwide we are proud to be one of them
be ahead of time
and deliver relevant content to our
children to an engagement curricula
education nowadays encourages to believe
that all children are the same and a
test can say how smart a child is well
let me tell your story jillian line it&#39;s
a British dancer and a choreographer
she&#39;s well known for the choreography of
two of the longest shows on Broadway
cats and the Phantom of the Opera her
talent was discovered by a doctor her
mother took her to the doctor and
explained about her lack of focus in
school after hearing everything she said
the doctor said to line that she that he
needed a private moment with her mother
so he turned on the radio and stepped
out of the room he then encouraged her
mother to look aligned as she was
dancing to the radio the doctor noted
she was actually a dancer and encouraged
her mother to take line to the dance
school now in her 90s Lyon was probably
lucky enough to be burned only nowadays
most probably she would have been
diagnosed with ADHD one of the most
important choreographers ever existed on
this planet would have been considered
an outsider with our current educational
standards every child should be treated
individually as a unique person with
specific needs this is why in all our
classes we have seven children so that
every teacher can do treat them
separately and help produce their
improvement and develop their education
another thing that we believe is that
education has evolved because now we
have whiteboards and tablets in class
although we do have new gadgets in class
we still believe all children are the
same and treat them under the same
patterns it&#39;s not enough to just write
on a table and think about yourself
you&#39;re engaging with your students and
they&#39;re engaged with the content you are
delivering
another myth and it&#39;s one of my
favorites is that exact Sciences and
Technology are just for boys boys play
with cars girls play with Barbies Chris
goes to basketball and robotics glasses
and a ghost ballet and piano classes
there is no such thing as technology and
exact Sciences are just for boys it&#39;s
not like they have in their DNA this
choice but it&#39;s a matter of mindset to
be open and let them try experience
exact Sciences another question I get a
lot is okay at the end of the course
will my kid receive certified diploma by
the Ministry of Education a diploma it&#39;s
not gonna say how smart a child is in
September as I said Apple launched sweet
playgrounds in two days from that moment
we had it in class in our programming
course technology it&#39;s changing very
fast so let&#39;s say that in three months
from here a new platform it&#39;s launched
and I consider it relevant and
interesting enough I will want to update
the curricula so a certificate in this
case wouldn&#39;t suit its purpose so why to
change something in education today&#39;s
news prepare us for the future
we have automated course google is been
testing them for a while and uber has
launched a fleet in Pittsburgh Amazon is
delivering its packages using a drone
delivery system and they&#39;re supposed to
deliver packages to our door in 30
minutes
we already have 3d printed houses a
Chinese company
printed a two-story villa in 45 days
that it&#39;s supposed to withstand an
earthquake measuring 8 on a Richter
scale in u.s. they have a robot lawyer
and we have software developed to
generate automated news for Fox and
Associated Press by 2025 million jobs
will be lost due to automation 2 million
new jobs will be gained as a
technological change even if you&#39;re not
a teacher or part of an institution you
can make a change stay informed make
sure you know what&#39;s happening in the
world make know you&#39;re up to date with
the technological changes who said I
could become a sim teacher when I
started hating math in school and ended
up studying communication and journalism
in university share your knowledge and
inspire others share your knowledge
especially to children and teenagers
they&#39;ll be the ones facing this wave of
technological change experiment anything
new
who said you cannot build a robot at
home with your children create science
experiments and make sure they
understand through hands-on activities
the world they live in
how children become inventors creators
not only consumers so I told you so I
told you about my math teacher in part
because people can impact someone&#39;s life
in part now I became a sim teacher
because of her always remember to
generate an impact in education and in
children life what started as a huge
challenge in my life to become a steam
teacher it&#39;s now part of my day-to-day
activities only that this time its steam
and not English thank you very much
[Applause]
