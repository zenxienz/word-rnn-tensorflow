here&#39;s the thing we humans obviously are
a complicated creatures our whole lives
are lived through a universe of thoughts
basically we think too much did you know
that we have approximately 70,000
thoughts per day although some of the
thoughts are just the same thoughts
repeating or an Oregon and yes it is
normal we were created to have thoughts
and adopt the word world for millenniums
what we don&#39;t really consider is that we
think too much but often about the wrong
things we always focus on these small
aspects of life and totally ignore
significant thoughts that shape us into
the human beings we are everyone in this
room has definitely gone through a phase
of life where they&#39;re insecure or
self-conscious about themselves we all
think about who everyone else wants us
to be and we offer sure think about who
impressing anyone around us these
specific thoughts about how we are not
good enough for this world how we have
to prove our worth to someone and how
everyone sees us as someone inferior and
unimportant are all triggered by one
very important thought acceptance now no
one would actually confess to sleeping
at night thinking about all the
judgmental people out there who
questions us for being ourselves we all
think about it now and then the problem
is we don&#39;t realize how affected we&#39;re
by these thoughts by our own thoughts
whatever I&#39;m 14 what do I know about the
world out there what people think what
people do right wrong I&#39;ve still got a
lot to explore but what I do know for a
fact is that the only common thing about
us Homo sapiens is that we are we are
not at all different from each other
Joe Cox who was a British politician
said it best
we have far more in common than that
which divides us think about it this way
we are all the same species we all came
from a single cell and we all do have
far more in common than just religion or
interest but here&#39;s a question of the
day why why would we want to be accepted
in a society full of people who are
mostly gonna throw all these judgments
our way about us not being what they
expected let me tell you why it&#39;s in our
mentality to be considered as accepted
it&#39;s part of our priorities as humans to
be recognized and appreciated however to
achieve real acceptance is to first seek
self acceptance and for that we need
these three qualities respect support
and compliance firstly respect to admire
something or someone deeply no matter
who you are what you look like or what
you do you deserve respect
I deserve respect to be respected as you
be treated as an equal and to respect
yourself it supreme is to be treated as
a whole which then leads on to
self-respect
however once you gain respect you tend
to lose your quality that earned the
respect that you have because you&#39;re
pressured by the people around you to
carry on being a role model with that in
mind it is easy to lose sight of purpose
which is your passion that started every
action that led to respect in the first
place however not all people go down
that path take Michelle Obama as an
example it is obvious that Michelle
gained recognition for being the wife of
the former President of the United
States but throughout her eight years of
being the first lady she didn&#39;t just sit
back and enjoy the luxury of fame and
power but she proved herself worthy and
gained respect by doing her country
proud even after she backed down his
first lady she&#39;s still participating in
many charity events including the one
for girls education which raised more
than 3.5
I believe in one years alone she stands
still for what you believe in even when
the power of authority is taken away why
can&#39;t you learn to be as honest and
independent as Michelle because you
don&#39;t have the fame the power the
recognition what you do have is your
good will your good heart and your good
soul learn to respect these qualities
inside you and use them as a sense of
direction to make a name for yourself if
you&#39;re one of those people who
completely change after receiving a
certain kind of attention let me tell
you what is really going on behind your
fake smile I understand that once you
gain respect there is pressure waiting
for you at every corner in every
direction you want to please others but
this is not what my talk is about my
talk is not about pleasing others let&#39;s
start by pleasing yourself be motivated
by the good that you do don&#39;t care about
what people think or what people say yes
compliments are good once in a while but
don&#39;t drown yourself in them doing
something to be popular only makes fake
friends you turn into this shallow and
vacuous person who might never be able
to redeem themselves from the loss of
their true passion so be true to your
character and your personality and learn
to accept yourself for your flaws and
mistakes because the true quality is the
one inside you and that is your heart
which does good out of its own will not
out of their hunger for fame or
recognition support is another quality
we should all receive and give to others
support it also means self care support
can also mean competition where there
are people rooting for you there are
also those who are jealous of your
achievements but to us support is all to
do with trust
we need reliable people to be by our
sides when we need support the person
here Trust is not always a person who
that that&#39;s closest to you but in time
we&#39;ll learn how to separate our real
friends from the one we think are real
for example I didn&#39;t know much about
Tina Fey or
amy poehler until my English teacher
mentioned their strong friendship on to
me four weeks ago this
fortunately resulting to me spending 64%
of my time watching their comedy videos
tienen a we met at the improv Olympics
as twenty-something improv comedians in
Chicago 1993 they&#39;ve been successful
comedians and lifelong best friends for
23 years and Counting
and no matter which we don&#39;t use to
watch I always notice the one thing they
both have in common and that is extreme
amount of confidence this is because
they have helped each other enhance
their personality not by competing but
by supporting one another like Tina and
Amy wherever I go I always feel more
supported when I run with my family or
friends whom I trust because I counted
them to take care of me exactly how I
take care of them because they know if I
never let them down don&#39;t ever let me
down if you don&#39;t have that kind of
support I guarantee you&#39;ll feel lonely
and empty and that is scary to not know
who to trust but take my advice and
first of all trust yourself and your
instincts because no one knows you
better than you by doing so you&#39;ll be
killing two birds with one stone not
only will you trust yourself and respect
and support your image but you&#39;ll be
lending a helping hand to others in the
same situation you&#39;ll trust the people
around you and you will be trusted in
return finally although you have respect
and support and competition and you feel
like for once you know where you belong
you can actually emotionally belong
somewhere until you learn to respect and
support yourself you will need to learn
to accept yourself for who you are I&#39;m a
teenager and I know what it&#39;s like 12
self doubt and to be self conscious I
love that life almost every day you live
that life every day as well doesn&#39;t
matter how old you are you&#39;ll always
have that one voice in your head
telling you to change to be better to be
different and fit in all the while I&#39;m
throwing my own judgments my way I
realized that if I&#39;m 14 and I have this
many issues of my identity what will
happen when I turn 40 when I still be a
coward and not accept myself for who I
am
will I still believe that everyone else
is better than me no I won&#39;t because I
choose not to because I don&#39;t want to
and why would you
Tina Lippert says when you know yourself
you&#39;re empowered when you accept
yourself you&#39;re invincible to accept
yourself is you have self support and
self respect not to always rely on other
choice be there for you and definitely
not to just throw yourself out there for
fame and popularity once you determine
what life you want to lead you will lead
it with the respect and support of
everyone behind you and the acceptance
that follows you to the end of the line
thank you
