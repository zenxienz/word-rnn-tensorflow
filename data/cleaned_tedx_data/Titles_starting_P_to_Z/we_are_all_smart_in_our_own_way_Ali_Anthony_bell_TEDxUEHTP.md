and I&#39;m who&#39;s been great so it&#39;s really
a hard act to follow but thanks
[Music]
[Applause]
so I&#39;m going to try to look at two
questions today first why is it
important for for us to know our
differences how why is it too important
to know how we are all smart and
secondly how we can use this knowledge
to achieve our full potential and go
beyond ourselves go beyond our limits so
I don&#39;t know if you have ever been
called stupid idiot
brainless I know I have I have an
algebra teacher in high school and she
made me really hate mouth you know I was
very good at algebra but I knew it
wasn&#39;t stupid I know it was smart and we
are all smart we&#39;re all smart in
different ways so that lots of examples
are on this everyone knows this maybe
you&#39;ve seen this here are a the 33
two-year-old Chinese girl playing piano
okay so this is an exceptional person
but we&#39;re all exception the examples
everywhere around this sometimes we have
natural talents like this girl and
sometimes we discover it early in life
and we&#39;re encouraged to do it and we
become better when we can masters it
whatever we are talents but more often
than not we&#39;re discouraged our parents
our teacher our teachers people around
this doubt say it tell us don&#39;t do that
you&#39;re not any good or don&#39;t do that you
won&#39;t make any money from it and so we
could be passing up some very very
important things we have to discover our
skills we have to go out and find what
we&#39;re good at
and what our intelligence our
intelligences are so when I was 10 I got
my first set of paints and it was like
something magic happened I so I still
remember the magic is I still have the
same magic every time so I started
painting and when I went into college
I was 17 and the vocational counselor
told me don&#39;t do that forget studio arts
you never make any money do something
else so I ignored his advice he wasn&#39;t
wrong I didn&#39;t make any money at it so I
ignored his advice and I did what I
wanted to do when I kept painting and so
many years later in fact it didn&#39;t
matter to me if I would make money or
not because I&#39;d already decided I was
never going to get married I was never
gonna have children so didn&#39;t matter if
I made money or not right so things
change in life what happened I fell in
love I got married when I became
pregnant and then at the time I was
spending all my time and all my energy
painting and even sometimes I would you
know I didn&#39;t care about money I I if I
had to find if I needed to color I would
rather spend my money on that tube of
paint than to eat because it was my
passion all of a sudden you know with
this change in my life I had to think
differently
my wife said okay your life artists it&#39;s
finished you have to get a job she&#39;s
right when you have another Mouse to be
yeah
responsibilities your passion has to
take a backseat right so I did that I
got a job and for the next 20 years my
paints went up into the Attic I didn&#39;t
touch a paintbrush for 20 years
except for maybe painting the house so
much later when I did come back to
painting and I found the same thrill
that I had when I was young another
thing happened to me one of my children
one of my first children was diagnosed
with dyslexia and I discovered all the
sudden that was dyslexic in fact I
didn&#39;t know what this like she was and I
found out from the doctor that it was
hereditary and I started reflecting on
my life and I realized that my father
was dyslexic and I was as well I am
dyslexic there&#39;s nothing extraordinary
about that in fact maybe you don&#39;t know
but 10 to 20% of the people in the world
are dyslexic yes that&#39;s right there&#39;s at
least 20% or 10 to 20% of the people in
this room now that are dyslexic many of
us don&#39;t know many of us don&#39;t know what
dyslexia is okay so look at all these
people who were dyslexic and this is
just a small sample dyslexia is a gift
it&#39;s a god-given gift and without all
these people having dyslexia the world
would not be the same I see it to give
it because yes it is like everything
every part of us that we have is gift so
Einstein well going back to Einstein
Einstein was dyslexic of course so is
Edison Edison his school teacher said
that he was a complete idiot
it was mentally
target and Einsteins schoolteacher said
that he was an ignorant fool will never
amount to anything so what do we have
right but Einstein said in the middle of
difficulty lies opportunity life is foot
life isn&#39;t always easy and the only way
that we can get it that we can improve
and to find ourselves is to challenge to
go ahead and to make mistakes and to
deal with the difficulties that we have
in every difficulty there&#39;s opportunity
you if without without any difficulties
we don&#39;t we get week we&#39;re blase we have
to have difficulties challenges so that
we can be strong every time we have
difficulties and we face them we make
mistakes we make errors but with this is
a growing experience and we learn and we
grow so 34 years ago Howard Gardner
probably most of you know I wrote a book
called frames of mind and he exposed its
theory of multiple intelligences so I
won&#39;t go into this too much today
because I don&#39;t have time to say very
briefly before this theory people pretty
much thought that intelligence was only
mathematical or logical or literary
linguistic and still many people think
this way now many people think of
intelligence as
like you but according to this theory
everyone has intelligences and many
people we have eight intelligences here
many people have many different
intelligences you don&#39;t live in it
you&#39;re not limited to one you it&#39;s not
because you are artists that you only
have visual intelligence or something
like that everyone has a mix of
smelliest okay so very briefly we have
logical mathematical naturalist bodily
kinesthetic musical rhythmic
interpersonal and social interpersonal
introspective this could be like emails
philosophers psychologists okay it&#39;s
much different from interpersonal and
social and we have visual spatial and
verbal linguistic going on how do we use
these intelligences okay how do we use
these to realize our full potential I
think the secret is in motivation there
are three motivational factors of higher
order amount of motivational factors
which are mastery autonomy and purpose
mastery is being an expert at something
that matters autonomy the need to direct
our lives and purpose doing something
which is makes a difference in the world
so we&#39;re going to look at these three
different motivational factors some
ideas but we have to get beyond this
because we have to if all experts know
that we don&#39;t know very much I went to
this period when I was about 25
whatever one example is find all the
reasons why God didn&#39;t exist okay Oh
many of us go through it some people get
stuck in it hopefully you don&#39;t okay so
next we&#39;ll talk about autonomy okay so
what you think of when you think of for
example artists or if you think about
Chisso means okay with the Down syndrome
do you think these people are autonomous
well I&#39;ve got this is Zuzu okay Zuzu is
an extraordinary person he&#39;s the only
conductor orchestra conductor in the
world who doesn&#39;t know how to read music
okay he doesn&#39;t understand currency
he doesn&#39;t probably is but he is capable
of memorizing all of the melodies in a
piece of music just by listening to it a
few times he knows all when he listens
to to a piece of music he knows all the
instruments this is extraordinary
this man has found he has musical
intelligence and he&#39;s found his his
reason he&#39;s found his his way so he has
some confidence and he has autonomy
complete autonomy we also have no no
idea guy on that okay another a person
with Down syndrome when she was young
she was refused going into nursery
school because she was called a monster
now at 31 years of age she is a nursery
school teacher okay what I&#39;d like to say
is if if these people can go beyond
their difficulties and if these people
can use their gifts to make a difference
in the world and and to help people
around them how can we say that we
aren&#39;t capable so how do we how do we
get beyond this and how do we - how do
we improve and go past our barriers I
think there are two things they&#39;re
essential one&#39;s positive was that - the
other is a growth mindset Carol Dweck is
a motivational scientist motivational
researcher from Stanford and she&#39;s done
many many studies on growth growth
mindset and tricks&#39; mindset this is very
important we all have these two mindsets
it&#39;s not your in one fix a mindset or in
a growth mindset we all have these and
but when you&#39;re operating out of a fixed
mindset you think that your talents and
your skills are innate that you are
either good at something or you&#39;re not
when you&#39;re operating from a growth
mindset your potential is unlimited you
can become better at anything and all of
us capable of becoming better in
anything it&#39;s a question of attitude and
growth mindset or a fixed mindset can be
either consciously or unconsciously
developed in either way so what we have
to do is to try to develop consciously
our growth mindset so how do we do this
once apart that&#39;s a game so developing a
growth mindset it means accepting the
fact that there are the weak will fail
the failure is not failure all of our
lives were taught to believe that
failure is something you do when you&#39;re
a loser
we&#39;re taught that an effort is something
that you have to do when you&#39;re not good
enough okay
and we have a were formatted to believe
that that if you fail or if you if you
make a mistake you&#39;re not good okay
so we have to get beyond this okay about
when I was about 30 years old I ran
across this beast of Native American
wisdom and it changed my whole
perspective so safe that everything on
the earth has a purpose every plant
cures for every herb cures a disease and
every person has a mission it&#39;s made me
reflect a little bit it&#39;s true there are
more than 12,000 plants on the earth and
all of them have been proven by science
are to to cure diseases so if all of
these plants cure diseases that they&#39;re
there for a reason and a purpose every
one of us also is here for a reason a
purpose we have to find
Pervis so one way to find your purpose
if you love it and the world needs it
it&#39;s your mission if the world leaves it
and you&#39;re paid for it
it&#39;s your vocation if you&#39;re paid for it
and you&#39;re great at it it&#39;s your
profession and if you&#39;re great at it
and you love it it&#39;s your passion so
penny for me it was crashing right it
wasn&#39;t a mission because I wasn&#39;t doing
anything to help the world it wasn&#39;t a
vocation or profession because I never
made you money so I had to wait until I
was over 15 to discover my my reason and
purpose in life I found my reason and
purpose in life I&#39;m happy I feel that I
succeeded in life I don&#39;t have money but
I&#39;m happy so Mark Twain said the two
most important days in your life are the
day you were born and the day you find
out why so I would urge you to go out
take chances make mistakes mistakes are
not mistakes they&#39;re part of learning
it&#39;s a learning process find out who you
are discover what your purpose is and
help to change the world
