before I start let me state a few
questions to you so we&#39;re gonna do it in
a show of hands how many of you have
smartphones and how many of them use how
many do you use them every day just
raise your hands if you use your
smartphone every day okay all right how
many of you are an active social network
user right so so many hands how many of
you actually use those things in
learning or teaching English wow that&#39;s
quite a lot quite more than I expected
it to be but it&#39;s okay it&#39;s it&#39;s quite
good because actually I personally
started to learn English when I was just
three years old and neither of those
things existed there was just me and my
elder sister and her motivation for me
was something like Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtle starts in 15 minutes you know
what it is like Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles so you know the tune right so
she said if you want to do your English
quick you&#39;re gonna miss this entrance
sequence with your favorite tune and
well God is my witness I wanted to see
those ninjas so I did my English as
quickly and correctly as possible just
not to miss it and my only two
inspiration and a friend and that was
actually a book maybe some of those
teachers who are just standing recognize
it it&#39;s English for children by
Valentino school tape now times are
different as well as students who study
English smart devices now a part and a
parcel of modern life we use them to
interact to each other to write texts to
take selfies
to do some shopping but why don&#39;t we use
them in teaching our students I know
that some of you might immediately show
me some funny looking apps from your
phones that promise that if you learn 10
words a day in 3 months time you will be
fluent in English I would like to talk
today about a serious problem which
according to recent statistics touches
more than just listen 68 percent of
Ukrainian teachers it&#39;s computer
illiteracy the old generation of
teaching without those demonic machines
and people who are doing this for
centuries so why should we do it now
like everything works fine but at the
same time those teachers give their
students a text with a sentence like
this I would like to tell you about my
friendly and gay family we all know
that&#39;s a pure example of outdated
language but when students starts to
laugh the teacher has no idea why what
about the new generation of teachers
well actually to tell the truth they
simply don&#39;t care because they usually
say that the salaries of educator
teacher or lecturer in Ukraine is so low
that students must be just thankful for
the fact that somebody has decided to
speak other language to them and learn
in this very way and now I actually
think and maybe it&#39;s gonna be a thought
for you to consider our task as teachers
is not just to dive into vocabulary but
to swim in the ocean of language and as
a caring parent bring some brain food to
our students and now I would like to
show you a few things that might blow
your students minds
in a very simple way it might seem
simple but it&#39;s practical and it works
so let&#39;s get started
imagine that you&#39;re standing in front of
your class and saying something like
today we&#39;re gonna work with Twitter and
your students gonna be like what like no
students books no workbooks no writing
and then you will continue saying like
it&#39;s not going to be like a text about a
story of a successful company and their
achievement but instead of that we&#39;re
gonna learn some real-time grammar try
to show them a pretexted post that you
did before which might look like this
was tired had the worst day ever they
were lazy didn&#39;t want to study went back
home and cried myself to sleep
hashtag am I doing this right and all of
you teachers now might identify all
those grammar that is in this small post
I am talking about transitive and
intransitive verbs I&#39;m talking about
different forms of adjectives I&#39;m
talking about pre texting and prewriting
something before had and many more
another example let&#39;s imagine that you
have project assignment for your high
school students it might be an opening
secret for you but when you&#39;re 16 it&#39;s
not that much fun anymore to do a paper
dolls and cut your old photographs and
to put the faces of your family to make
them look true so for that case you can
use something like this to inspire them
to do an Instagram story to make photos
of their family and to write a short
story about each of them for example now
it&#39;s a photo of my family
which was taken a few years ago and I&#39;m
proud to say that I am the only boy in
my family I&#39;ve got so many sisters
nieces cousins sisters unfortunately my
mom is not in on this photo because she
decided to have her coffee than to take
a selfie with us but as I said it here
maybe next time it might be more
creative it might be more interesting
for them to interact with their phones
for studying another topic traveling or
tourism ask your students to find the
most picturesque place in their hometown
and just to make a check-in there from
their Facebook page posting some photos
and telling that this very place is the
most awesome place in my hometown and
you ought to visit it for me as I am the
representative of the capital Ukraine
Kiev I was born and raised there for me
it&#39;s obviously my done as a largeness -
after that after all that you have done
obviously you need to appraise your
students in some way so you can do
something like asking them to make a
meme with your face on it and this meme
they will stick to the board and it&#39;s
gonna be there for a week and pre
answering your questions no it&#39;s not
going to be offensive believe me because
as all kids they will just ask for more
that&#39;s why they will try to be as polite
as possible also I know that most of you
are now after all these sessions
thinking something like but changes are
so hard like I&#39;ve been working with the
same book for 20 years and I had some
good achievements so why should I change
why should I change and how difficult is
is to change something which works even
if we don&#39;t like it
correct me if I&#39;m wrong but a few years
ago we have already changed something
that we didn&#39;t like yes and I want to
have a round of applause for those
people who did it because they deserve
it if they done it why can&#39;t we do our
changes in our classrooms why can&#39;t we
just build this bridge between our
students and us with the help of smart
device and now I would like all of you
to raise your hand and we&#39;ll try to do a
symbolic click that will show that you
are ready to upgrade yourself you are
ready to be the very first century
teacher so please raise your hands and
in encounter three let&#39;s let&#39;s do this
click three two one so my congrats to
all of you now you one step closer to
becoming the teacher of version 2.0
thank you very much
[Applause]
