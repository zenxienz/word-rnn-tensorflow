now I&#39;ve seen many tech talks like many
of you have and it struck me that very
few of them talk about this sort of
interdisciplinary topics that we discuss
like corruption so I want to talk today
about rules games and and corruption and
part of that will be the use of game
theory to analyze corruption as well as
ethics and perhaps the object of that
law so let me start by talking about
rules rules for cooperation there&#39;s much
talk about zero-sum games and non zero
sum games and win-win situations all
that sort of thing so what are these non
zero sum or zero-sum game is a thing
like for example tennis if I score it&#39;s
good for me and it&#39;s bad for you and if
you score is bad for me and it&#39;s good
for you and then there are win-win
situations which you might also call
positive some games which are situations
that are good for both of us and people
kind of relish in in pointing out those
win-win situations is sort of a thing at
the moment usually followed with some
kind of triumphant smirk and then we
must also maybe not forget that less
fashionable lose-lose situations which
are the ones where the outcome is bad
for both you and me so I want to propose
to you that win-win situations are
actually everywhere abundant when you
engage in a trade on eBay for example
then as a buyer of a good you&#39;ve done
that probably of your own volition and
what you&#39;re buying is a good so it&#39;s
good for you so it&#39;s better for you than
the money that you would get in return
on the other hand there is a seller and
the seller is also better of having
engaged in the trade of course because
for him there&#39;s a healthy profit profit
coming from it in otherwise he wouldn&#39;t
have done it
win-win situations like that actually
abundant we can find them anywhere
so whether you go to the pub for a pint
or you go to the supermarket to buy some
toilet paper
all of those are win-win situations I
want to propose to you I want to go a
little bit deeper I want to show to you
why rules are actually important to us
and why it&#39;s not just about win-win
situations now that is the proposal that
rules are in essence what makes us
overcome
uncertainty and makes transactions
between each other cheaper so needless
to say when we think about the
transactions on on ebay for example then
the question is why is it possible that
both of us can trust each other so that
you can why over some money to China and
at the same time trust that the good
will be sent across to you how can we
trust in this situation the answer for
this are rules so let&#39;s start like an
economists will talk about this in that
sort of slightly crude fashion imagine a
world where we don&#39;t have any rules
something like Anarchy for example if
you imagine you are a farmer for example
in this world and you set about I don&#39;t
know growing some crops and storing some
grain then countering is a great deal of
uncertainty it&#39;s not so easy to just
sell the stuff it&#39;s very expensive
because you have to make sure not just
to be protected against droughts and
storms but also against loot and pillage
so you can&#39;t trust your neighbour that
you just won&#39;t use violence to take the
stuff off of you so it&#39;s best to be
shorter mist and selfish in that
situation why is it that we can in fact
trust as a farmer to grow our crops or
to send the money across the China and
so on and so forth it&#39;s because we have
rules good rules in this case
institutions like in this case eBay and
PayPal that make it possible for us to
have these transactions with one another
you know as a trader on eBay if you&#39;re a
seller that if you send the good across
if you don&#39;t send it
across if you don&#39;t play by the rules
that you will lose out you will be
barred from participation this one means
a loss of trade and a loss of income so
in other words people will keep to these
rules and what we get to is a sort of
flourishing Society this is what we see
all around us institutions good
institutions work for us and make it
possible that society prospers as we
look through the centuries until where
we are today
now I mentioned at the beginning
corruption so I want to definitely get
back to that how do they get to this
when I was a master student I had just
quit my job I was working in the IT
industry for one of the large
multinational corporations and I found
myself in a tricky situation where on
the one hand I was paid double as much
as I&#39;m being paid now which is 10 years
down the line on the other hand I was
grappling with the issue of the doctrine
of profit maximization and so on at the
time it was the financial crisis this
big company one of the biggest companies
in the world had just laid off twenty
five thousand people at the same time
they paid three and a million dollars to
the top five individuals of the company
I thought I need to study this this is a
big conundrum I realized this was hard
to digest truth that actually it&#39;s very
hard to find a corporation that makes a
negative net contribution to society
in fact certainly my employer wasn&#39;t one
of them
the numbers I told you are true but at
the same time they are spending they are
paying in tax money vast amounts much in
excess of the three and a million and
they were employing several hundred
thousand employees across the globe&#39;s
globe so I realized a real issue is not
what corporations do when they&#39;re when
when they&#39;re not doing the right thing
perhaps I was wondering what was wrong
there it was possibly the rules that
were bad but I realized one much more
big problem much bigger problem is
corruption corruption in fact is the
biggest obstacle to one of the biggest
obstacles of the
to human development and here just some
numbers so I&#39;m not gonna read them out
to you but I thought striking is for
example of the World Bank reckons that
50% of its donations across history have
not gone into healthcare where they
should should have gone for example but
in to corrupt hands and there are
millions of facts out there these are
just some up like from the internet a
day ago so we want to think about what
we could do about this so let me go back
to rules and corruption I wanted to
think about how I could study this
problem and initially I was thinking I
was reading different articles in
political science and political economy
and it&#39;s struck me there were lots of
different proposals some countries are
rich in resources others have scarce of
resources some have hot climates or more
moderate climates all of these were
explanations people in the northern
hemisphere in the southern hemisphere
and cultural things in the end I realize
there&#39;s only one thing that really
matters and that was the rules that
govern people&#39;s behavior rules actors
incentives for how we act in the world
and the perfect place to start with this
and the answer really to it was game
theory for me because rules is about
strategic interactions between ourselves
and the question of how the rules lead
us to behave in the way we do behave so
how do we start I started by thinking
about corruption as a transaction you
have a briber who pays a bribe to an
official and these guys are engaging in
this little transaction with each other
which might be a win-win situation for
them but you also have a loser Society
so if you look at it at a bigger scheme
not in that narrow sense and actually
it&#39;s a lose-lose situation because
society certainly is losing out because
whatever there being corrupt about it&#39;s
not going to be good to a society by
definition and at the same time it is
probably in the long run also bad for
the initial perpetrators because if you
just imagine an example like Brazil
you&#39;ll have on the one hand millions of
people that live in favelas on the other
hand you&#39;ve got an a small rich elite
that live in
self-built golden prisons high security
which they can only leave in armored
vehicles just because they have to fear
that the money that they&#39;ve made is
going to be taking off of them by the
people they&#39;re not as well-off you get
where I&#39;m going with that story so let&#39;s
think about how to think of corruption
as a game here are sort of three people
if you like you&#39;ve got a briber and a
public official and you&#39;ve got an
inspector and we can sort of take them
as metaphors for groups of people in the
Society of you like the briber hands a
bribe gets some kind of permit that he
likes it&#39;s good for him but it&#39;s bad for
us because we don&#39;t want that guy to go
about the business that he&#39;s doing any
plot a couple of legal fishing you&#39;ve
got the inspector is watching these guys
going through piles of permits to see
whether there&#39;s corruption in there or
not now what is the condition under
which the briber pays the bribe crudely
speaking it depends on two things on the
one hand he only pays it if the official
is going to reciprocate pays back the
bribe pays pays that gives him back the
permit on the other hand we need the
briber to not fear that he&#39;s going to
get incarcerated so the balance has to
be just right an expectation he meets he
needs to be better off by paying the
bribe same goes for the public official
if he thinks he&#39;s going to go to prison
with a to higher likelihood then he&#39;s
not going to accept the bribe and
reciprocate but instead decline it now
what about the inspector we could think
about his incentives too so this
inspector has a world in which he knows
there is a certain relatively high
punishment for both of the parties and
he&#39;s got a pile of permits if he does
his work in a diligent fashion he&#39;s
going to look through all of the permits
and you realize there&#39;s no corruption in
there because the other guys can
anticipate that they can know that if
punishment is high in every permit is
checked
they wouldn&#39;t engage in the crime
because they&#39;ll find out so that is when
the inspector things well maybe I
shouldn&#39;t check all of them just check
the sporadically and this is where the
chance creeps in that it might just
make sense to pay a bribe or reciprocate
so what ensues is a complicated analysis
which I&#39;m not going to bore you with but
what we can do instead is look at the
results so I want to think about rules
as incentives again how we can make sure
that we undermine the corrupt behavior
that we see there here are two ways of
how we could do that I propose to you
two different punishment regimes one
regime would be what moral philosophers
might call a deontological approach as a
rights-based approach where we say we
want just punishment so if we want just
just punishment we&#39;re looking at these
two perpetrators we&#39;re thinking both of
them are guilty as each other because
they&#39;re both in it together then we
should also punish them equally that
would be one proposal and this is in
fact what many countries do instead we
tried something else and we said what
happens if we punish them differently if
we have an asymmetric punishment regime
regime and the results were surprising
we found that if you punish bribes very
little and you punish officials a lot
then what you do is you undermine the
reciprocal relationship between the two
the probability of reciprocation goes
right down because it never pays off if
you have such a high penalty as an
official and then as a bribe as you know
your bribe will barely ever be
reciprocated you don&#39;t see it much point
in bribing either so with the asymmetric
regime you end up with corruption being
very low with corruption very low very
few people will go to prison if they
ever get caught now if you compare the
two regimes in the first case what
you&#39;ll find is yeah you&#39;ve got a lot of
people that are corrupt and you punish
them justly you&#39;ve got lots of people
that justly punished are in prison with
the second regime
you&#39;ve got very few people little to no
corruption and very few people that end
up in prison albeit punished unjustly
now we could decide for the latter
because that seems relatively intuitive
intuitive to be the better answer to the
problem but the point is
bigger than that what I want to say is
that we can use the tools that were
giving given in philosophy and economics
in this case and game theory to you to
understand problems like corruption and
to analyze the law that we have in this
and in many other cases to decide
whether it&#39;s efficient in trying and
achieving the things that we wanted to
achieve in society and with that I want
to end by just saying what the nature of
good rules is so the final proposal is
that I think the best thing that the
good rules that we have the institutions
that govern our society when they are
good are the best accomplishment of any
society now whether it is above the
totalitarian governments that we
becoming increasingly so when we&#39;re
surrendering our rights and are being
surveilled with every step that we do
all in the name of the fight against
terror or whether it&#39;s about corrupt
regimes that dominate the population and
take from it whatever they can what I
would like you to realize is that good
rules good institutions are the things
that make us maximize our potential for
win-win situations they maximize the
potential there minimize the potential
for lose-lose situation of which we are
equally capable and it&#39;s these good
rules that prevent the types of
situations that start so harmlessly with
charismatic leadership and and so
hopefully in war or tyranny thank you
very much
