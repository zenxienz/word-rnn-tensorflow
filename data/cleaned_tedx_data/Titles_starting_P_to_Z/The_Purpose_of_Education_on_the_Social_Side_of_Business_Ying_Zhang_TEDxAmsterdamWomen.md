this suburb I had a good opportunity to
discuss a topic of happiness and
education with a group of excellent
school principals from China the idea
was actually to identify from different
groups in different regions what matters
in our lives
were the matters in our will in our
education and what is the relationship
between this tool I still remember one
school principal told me something like
this which I couldn&#39;t forget for my life
he said we have to find a ways to help
our students improve academic
performance even though we know that
such tough academic training system will
bring tremendous hardship and stress to
our students parents and schools but we
have no choice because academic output
and the performance so far is one of the
most objective measures to improve and
promote our students that&#39;s why we have
to be very tough
this might sound very extreme to my
academic and education fellows from this
part of the world but the study have
already showed that in the high-income
countries education has not sufficiently
improve students basic academic skills
even though we have a lot of resources
available back in the day we know that
education is mean to bring knowledge and
skills today education has become a
symbol of our social and economic status
and is one of the most important ancient
tickets to the job market but the
reality is we have so many people
educated in the same way
but we don&#39;t have enough jobs especially
we don&#39;t have highly paid jobs for those
highly educated kids in the end there
are more and more people becoming
aggressive and patient and are happy
which creates a lot of a lot of social
economic and environmental strengths so
what are the problem and what are the
sources of these problems one argument
we often heard was inequality usually we
measure inequality and equality from
economics perspective and we humans
knows that we have very much value of
those things measured by economic
returns roses and value those things
beyond economics I give you example
we&#39;ve been talking about gender equality
and equality for a long time and claim
that women should have equal access to
the job market and should have equal pay
to men but we like the capability to
measure those values that only women can
do for example giving birth and
breastfeeding babies and most of the
time housework family administration and
Family Education if we calculated the
economic returns of those work that
women have been doing by considering the
fact that women be taking care of the
next generation for the future society
women should be paid objectively much
higher than those men who work as
bankers lawyers and doctors yes
I give you example in China actually
wife paid by husband for their home work
or for their house work and sometimes
it&#39;s up to 8,000 per month so I remember
when I was a kid and in my generation we
were educated in the childhood to love
to share and to trust but throughout the
education what we learned we learn to
compete to fight and to defend them
we&#39;ve been changing our environment from
an ecosystem to an ecosystem even though
that we claim that we need a ecosystem
and we through years of education to
learn about the outer world
well physics chemistry biology geography
economics and so on we develop the
institutions to replace the people to
people&#39;s trust we developed management
and skills to rule over others and
resources what we in London looks
objective but actually all pointed it to
others rather than oneself in the end we
learned so much about others especially
about other&#39;s problems particularly
about other countries problems but we
find it so difficult to look at ourself
and deal with our own problems so what&#39;s
wrong with this picture and how to deal
with that in order to figure out the
problem
I argue that all the problems coming
from education and the solution can only
come from education to figure out how
early our kids has already started and
developed the idea about the purpose of
Education I conduct a series of
interview with kids from 6 years old
who
just enter into the elementary school to
11 years old who were about to
transition to the secondary school it is
very interesting to see that the Kidman
side actually switched around 11 years
old and by that time the kids already
developed a very clear and direct link
from their current education to their
future education and then to the degree
diploma of their higher education and
then to the job and money
I remember one eleven-year-old boy told
me this a very serious way he said if
you don&#39;t have university degree
you know what you got a huge problem
huge problem because you won&#39;t find any
job meaning that you will become
homeless Wow seriously where does this
idea come from so the kids actually told
me that okay
the better quality of the education
comes from the better ranked education
and the better rented education meaning
that you will have a better degree and a
better degree means that you have a
better job and a better job means that
you will have more money and with money
you will become very happy because money
can bring you a lot of happiness well
okay
I was shocked him so I continued to ask
a kid I said okay so can you please tell
me that let&#39;s suppose something that
some you don&#39;t need to worry about money
in the future and you don&#39;t need to find
jobs for future and you have all the
money in the world to spend what do you
do then the kids side 11 years old kid
say that I would stop going to school
and I will study at home with my parents
some other kids said I will stop project
with my friends and some other kids said
I would create jobs rather than find
jobs for people I said okay so what do
you do
make yourself happy in the future when
you grew up they said I will find
partner I love and who loves me to make
myself happy I will give something back
to my parents to make my parents happy I
will call my friends to meet frequently
and discuss ideas you see the logic of
kids there are actually two tracks of
reasoning in case had one track was
taught by us to be competitive to count
economic returns to be individualism to
be comparative that is all about
inequality and the other track is the
kids heart based reasoning to love to
share to collaborative to eco orientated
that is all about equality in the
transition from inequality to equality I
argue that education plays the most
important role an equation doesn&#39;t only
mean the formal school education but
also means that a larger context of
Education from family and society in
order to offer an eco comprehensive and
qualified education which includes the
knowledge and wisdom towards out world
and in the world we have to be very
conscious that education is mean to how
people identify and develop their
uniqueness by respecting diversification
and inclusiveness and that is a core of
equality knowledge and skills towards
the outer world are very very important
but knowledge and wisdom towards the
inner world counts the quality of our
life
our happiness and the purpose of our
education thank you
