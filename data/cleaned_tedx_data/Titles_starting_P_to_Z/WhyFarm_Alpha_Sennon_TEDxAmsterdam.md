one step beyond

son I killed that soy every day until I
told I would that&#39;s all
[Music]
freedom from what this land of China and
obiagu
has been a symbol of oppression for more
than four centuries that&#39;s over here
generations of my kin I am a people
whose descendant its culture of
Agriculture yet still I just like it we
see that something that takes away
freedom not something that gives I grew
up on a cup on livestock farm but I

hated it I hated waking up 5:00 a.m.
every morning the tired of boots and see
about the chickens
I like feeding the Ducks what we can
absolutely no thank you
the same thing applies when I return
from school when my friends would be
playing video games and looking at
cartoons
I&#39;m busy collecting eggs and shelling
peas I would continuously ask myself on
the farm why why should I found I made
up my mind that I would move furthest
away from agriculture and agriculture
will be nowhere in my future
I went on to university and pursue a
degree in math and physics I was kicked
out required to withdraw the college and
being diplomatic one year later I
reapplied and tried information
technology that immediately didn&#39;t work
out and one day the Dean says to me
alpha why not try agribusiness
agribusiness what is our business Agri
half business
shreya Slater first class honors
valedictorian and I started repping the
Caribbean as the youth in agricultural
voice and I would often hear this hello
good day mr. Shannon you&#39;re a vibrant
young man and we love your vision you&#39;ve
created quite a buzz to tell you the
truth and we love to have you as the
voice of the youth hahaha and then they
gave us a flight and the first a photo
up on the second summit on the truth but
from my voice zip and a bloody word I
started realizing that all these
conferences and these discussions it was
the slip surface they never wanted to
hear what I had to say a turning point
knew was when I had any the first global
thoughtful food summit I was one of five
hundred delegates at the two-day summit
to answer a single equation
how do we feed nine billion people by
the year 2050
how&#39;s that for solving for one of the
world&#39;s greatest dilemmas I finally felt
as though I was part of a solution I
finally felt as though my voice will be
heard I returned to my twin island
Republic of Trinidad and Tobago of just
1833 square miles and 1.3 million people
with a small farming population where
the average age of the farmer is 60
years an increase in engine and tobago
we have one of the most fertile soils in
the world but guess what all food and
pork bill is four billion US dollars I
[Music]
immediately pulled out my calculator and
I started to walk some more equations we
in the year 2017 and the average age of
a farmer is six feet My dear 2015 that
farmer might just be dead maybe like 93
right mm-hmm and a very few young
farmers which we have let&#39;s see about 30
years of age by the year 2050
there would be 63 they will be retired
or hopefully our five and ten year olds
though there would be approximately 45
years of age there would be our young
professionals by that year but the
question is who will feed this nine
billion population by this year what are
our five and ten year olds thinking
about becoming do what are you thinking
about studies have shown that there&#39;s a
drastic decrease in youth engagement
that agriculture how can we then put
agriculture back into them
the consider this as a career we
realized that we must make agriculture
agriculture as a child do I remember
looking at a cartoon all captain planets
mm-hmm I would be so environmentally
aware pick up the paper not waste the
water after this day I still remember
the captain planet song and I saw some
of you remembers well it goes like this
Captain Planet he&#39;s a hero he&#39;s gonna
bring pollution down to zero and I
stopped but something like this is
missing for agriculture
there must be an adventure to encourage
youth in agriculture starting with a
main character who&#39;s branded as the
world&#39;s most powerful food provider
[Music]
[Applause]
see the older than half the planet if
you plant the tree you can eat for free
this will guarantee food security they
feel the film doesn&#39;t let it spike so we
can put an empty road l see all the yep
read through the whole movie country
full of ugly man ladies and gentlemen
[Music]
what is it the food imposter has just
been spotted really a set to interfere
it is coming in to report this blow only
chance
go get him go get him there was active
and safe in the day again so we realize
that every man must nurse not just only
teach the kids about farming he must
persuade enter it&#39;s healthy to eat local
to be responsible yes I said it
rice responsible not waste one grain of
rice to show empathy to other children
around the world who don&#39;t have food and
of course Agra creativity we can&#39;t wait
until university to teach the children
about food security nor can we wait
until we get a PhD to learn about
climate change adaptability we take the
messages of argument through all the
schools in China and tobago using our
artery and you teen men tools spoken
word poetry music
what is important is that the problem is
creating youth engagement the solution
is creatively engaged in youth we don&#39;t
only say that there are innovative ways
to farm we show them using our ponics
cards our selfie boxes kids are given
the opportunity to join the our dream
and fan club after more school visits
teachers would call us and say the kids
are only singing the argument song they
will love to come on the farm and grow
food an argument last year much we
conducted a workshop we asked the kids
to come up with a female version for our
women you guys will never believe what
name they came up with I&#39;ll give you a
photo
sinter sister
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
people all over the world so agreement
to be a solution for youth engagement in
agriculture we were able to launch it
over nine countries one Zambia Nigeria
Haiti in less than one year we were able
to reach so many people over 20,000
people every man have walked over 5000
students I started to think about what
if we can go to the cinema one day and
look at the animation adventures of our
dream on what would that do for Global
nutrition food and security
would that have an impact on our five
and ten year olds what is interesting is
that while preparing this talk I
realized that the story of argument is
my story it&#39;s what I needed as a child
it&#39;s what I missed from an early age for
me to develop that passion I believe
that argument and photos in the system
must play an integral role in the
education of each boy and girl I&#39;m now
finally able to understand and answer
the question I was asking myself when I
was maybe seven years on the farm and
today you guys will help me answer it
the question of why farm my giving me a
simple crap like this
why farm you say if you Claudia
shouldn&#39;t
why farm today if you don&#39;t who would
why found or fled the earth need food
why from Isis about greater good it&#39;s
about freedom it&#39;s about freedom freedom
from what freedom to eat healthy and
safe food freedom to grow your own food
of your own free will
productive become a farmer freedom
wife um ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls
Aquaman and photos in the syste is one
step beyond the beyond
[Applause]
