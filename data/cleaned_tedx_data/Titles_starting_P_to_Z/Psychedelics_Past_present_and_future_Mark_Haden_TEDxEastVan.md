I have been standing in front of
audiences for thirty years talking about
drugs and I often start my presentations
with an apology
specifically I apologize for the lies of
past drug educators including myself and
I acknowledge that we&#39;ve told three lies
we&#39;ve exaggerated the harms of drugs
we&#39;ve never acknowledged the benefits of
drugs and we&#39;ve never talked about the
dominant model for controlling drugs in
our society which is drug prohibition
which has failed us all so badly now for
much of my career I&#39;ve talked about that
last point talked about the failure of
the war on drugs but today I&#39;m going to
talk about the benefits of drugs
specifically I&#39;m going to talk about
psychedelics now psychedelics have been
around in human cultures since before
recorded human history and we can see at
least four communities cultures today
that have woven the psychedelic
experience into the fabric of their
culture does the curanderos use of
psilocybin mushrooms the ayahuasca used
in the Amazon basin there&#39;s the whole
use of peyote and the shamanic use of
Amanita muscaria in Siberia now on the
surface how the container of safety is
created with these cultures with this
psychedelic experience is all different
but if you look at how the experience is
integrated into the culture that it&#39;s
actually quite similar they&#39;re used for
healing
everything from psychological to
physical issues they&#39;re used for
celebration of transitions everything
from seasonal changes to puberty rites
and they&#39;re used for spirituality to
connect the individuals and the culture
to the cosmos as a whole
if I wanted to use one word to describe
that what I would say is the word would
be pro-social psychedelics have always
been used to connect people to their
culture and to the universe so it was
historically unprecedented what happened
in the 1960s when psychedelics got
linked to an antisocial message it had
never happened before Tim Leary said
tune in turn on and drop out and the
subsequent social backlash has caused
immense human suffering and it goes on
today at a bit early there were some
other cultural issues going on at the
time but certainly that disconnects
message was profound and the media
participated in the spinning of a web of
illusions LSD Safed ape rapes TV actress
LSD made me a prostitute girl gives
birth to frog and even the science of
the time was suppressed for 40 years
scientists couldn&#39;t do what they needed
to do which is measure stuff now can I
think of any other time in human history
when science is either being suppressed
or criminalized well it&#39;s a matter of
fact I can in 1616 and then for the hub
subsequent 143 years the science of the
telescope was banned it was illegal for
people to report what they saw through
the lens of the telescope specifically
that the earth was not the center of the
universe LSD is to the study of the mind
what the telescope is to astronomy and
what the microscope is to biology
according to stanislav grof well
psychedelics are back
this is the Canadian Medical Association
Journal the conservative voice of
Canadian medicine with a number of
articles exploring the psychedelic
Renaissance the explosion of research
has happened in recent years that&#39;s
really what I want to talk to you about
but to be really clear what I&#39;m talking
about here is skilled trained competent
professionals using pure substances in
ways that are well supervised I&#39;m not
talking about impure street drugs used
by unsupervised irresponsible
adolescents so how do researchers think
about psychedelics these days because
they break them into three categories
the first are the classics LSD mescaline
dimethyltryptamine and psilocybin and
these offer researchers a variety of
attributes that are worthy of
investigation for example spirituality
now it&#39;s kind of neutral spirituality
because Buddhists find the Buddha
Christian&#39;s find Christ an atheists and
agnostics find the entire universe and
this particular aspect of these
medicines is quite useful for situations
like end-of-life anxiety when we are
dying and we&#39;re anxious about the
experience and we take a dosage of
psilocybin and we meet our maker and
we&#39;re told it&#39;s okay we can relax we&#39;re
just coming home it tends to reduce the
stress of that transition the classical
psychedelics also offer a disorientation
of the ego which can be very helpful in
things like treatment for alcoholism
they also increase the permeability
between the unconscious and the
conscious mind they allow us to have
access
to our unconscious in a way that we
don&#39;t normally if you really think about
the human experience a lot of our lives
are lived unconsciously for example
driving a car our conscious mind is
thinking about the radio and what we&#39;re
gonna have for lunch and the conflict we
had with our spouse or whatever we don&#39;t
think about our feet our unconscious
mind is driving the car we live our
lives with lots of tape loops that just
happen automatically and if something
bad happened to us in childhood and it&#39;s
replaying itself consistently in our
adult life and causing problems for us
it&#39;s very hard to access because it&#39;s
unconscious psychedelics can help with
that psychedelics also offer the classic
psychedelics offer what I call the
portal effect which is the wow that was
incredible effect it&#39;s a bit like
climbing Mount Everest or graduating
high school you have a sense of
accomplishment and transition and that&#39;s
very helpful in many conditions the
second group of psychedelics are the
empathic ins 3 mm C MDA MDMA are
examples and what they do is they bond
people and increase empathy and that&#39;s
really useful to bond a therapist to
somebody who wants some help
that connection is really important it
could be facilitated with these
medicines they also take away fear so if
a soldier who&#39;s been in battle in
Afghanistan comes back to North American
is replaying that trauma again and again
normal therapy can&#39;t access it partly
because it&#39;s unconscious but partly
because if anything it gets close to it
has a huge fear response and MDMA
specifically takes away that fear and
allows the tape to be reworked it
appears that mdma-assisted psychotherapy
may be the best treatment for PTSD
post-traumatic stress disorder that
exists
and then there&#39;s everything else things
like ibogaine which appear to be
incredibly helpful for heroin
withdrawals opiate addiction this 2cb
the salvia and this ketamine that seems
to be helpful for depression now my own
area of academic interest is
articulating post-prohibition models for
the regulation and control of all
currently illegal drugs based on public
health principles you might have noticed
drug prohibition is slowly crumbling
under the weight of its own
ineffectiveness it does not protect our
communities it does not protect our
families and it does not protect our
children so it will end and I ask the
question what are we going to replace it
with peering through the lens of Public
Health so the goal of a public health
approach is to maximize the benefits and
minimize the harms I&#39;ve already talked
about some benefits so I&#39;d like to talk
about harms the harms from all drugs can
be broken into three categories
dependency toxicity and behavior
dependency I worked for the addiction
services for 30 years
nobody ever walked in my office saying I
can&#39;t stop taking LSD it never happened
so the dependency potential for
psychedelics is really low toxicity the
last time you took a prescription drug
if you took six times the dosage you
probably did yourself harm that 1 to 6
ratio is very common for most drugs with
LSD it&#39;s in the thousands in fact Albert
Hofmann who invented LSD said it was one
of the least toxic substances on the
planet so dependency is very low
toxicity is very low so all of the harms
from psychedelics come from one thing
which is the behavior
which is essentially lack of supervision
now indigenous communities have known
this for years they&#39;ve always provided
the experience in a very tight container
of safety where they&#39;re highly
supervised experiences how researchers
are thinking about this today is they
think about the words or they talk about
the words set which is expectations
setting which is the environment dosage
which is what you take in how much and
safety which is the umbrella term so set
setting safety and dosage are carefully
structured by the research community
today so in a post prohibition world if
the goal is to maximize the benefits and
minimize the harms of psychedelics
people would have access to the
psychedelic experience so long as they
were supervised there was a container of
safety built around the experience and
somebody was in charge a trained
competent skilled professional who is
licensed would be allowed to offer the
experiences to others so long as set
setting dosage and safety were managed
and it wouldn&#39;t matter what the
environment was it could be indigenous
healing circles
it could be psychedelic psychotherapy it
could be multi-day dance festivals it
doesn&#39;t matter as long as somebody is in
charge I would like to reflect on the
human predicament today we&#39;re in trouble
as a species global climate change is
affecting all of us there&#39;s a
concentration of wealth at the top of
the pile that is unprecedented in any
society so few people control so much
wealth there&#39;s a huge amount of violence
and religious extremism and we live in
these fairly strange societies were
somehow we&#39;ve equated happiness with
buying stuff
so if I really think about those
problems there problems of disconnection
we are disconnected from the earth we
are disconnected from each other we are
disconnected from a true sense of
meaning and purpose in our lives and
we&#39;re disconnected from healthy
spiritual experiences the good news is
psychedelics are all about connections
these two images are very powerful their
depictions of the human brain based on
neuroscience the one on the left is the
normal human brain the parts of the
outside of the circle are the different
parts of the human brain the visual
cortex for example notice that the
visual cortex talks a lot to the visual
cortex and not a lot to the other parts
of the brain the image on the right is
the human brain under the influence of
psilocybin notice the rich range of new
connections that are formed psychedelics
are all about connections connections
with self we have access to our
unconscious minds in a way we do not
normally have access to
connections with each other that&#39;s the
empathic and research connections with a
sense of meaning and purpose to life
there&#39;s a lot of research done on that
and connections with a sense of true
spirituality indigenous communities have
known that for centuries I
sake Asimov said one of the saddest
aspects of life now is that science
gathers knowledge faster than society
gathers wisdom we as a human species
need to grow up we need to take
advantage of and learn and work with the
knowledge that we already have and
perhaps just perhaps something that
could help us mature as a species and
maybe even insist with our survival is
mature skillful wise use of psychedelic
medicines thank you
you
