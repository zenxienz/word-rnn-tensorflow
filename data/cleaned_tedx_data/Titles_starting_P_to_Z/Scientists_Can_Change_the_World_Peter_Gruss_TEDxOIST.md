welcome everybody and and konnichiwa as
we say here in Japan it&#39;s a great
pleasure to see in particular so many
young and happy faces because it&#39;s you
young people the young students the
young scientists the young postdocs who
were born into an age with an advanced
technology that recited in the
historically highest level of prosperity
but as a consequence you have also
inherited some global challenges such as
climate change such as increasing energy
demand and there&#39;s almost a real inner
relative relationship between the wealth
of a country and the amount of energy
that is being used and in not so distant
future we will have 9 billion people
living on this planet many of them will
be in aging societies with all the
related diseases so mankind relies on
your creativity your intelligence your
integrity and your responsibility to
solve these problems that are ahead of
you and being on the brink of the fourth
Industrial Revolution we will reach very
soon the age of exponential knowledge
that is to say the collective global
knowledge will double every 12 hours
this is a result of women and men
worldwide dedicating their life to
generating knowledge through science and
as one of them I can assure you there is
no profession that allows you such an
intellectual freedom
freedom to put your ideas into effect
and have an impact on the course of
history having spent a life in science
myself I thought I sum up what is
necessary to become young a good
scientist in the essence of what I
learned can be summarized in the five Cs
of success first be curious Albert
Einstein once said I have and we&#39;ve just
seen him we have well on a picture I
have no special talent I&#39;m just
passionately curious so all of you will
know that you are doing the right thing
if you are passionate about it do not
drag on projects or things that you do
not like to do just to please others an
intense curiosity has served many of the
greatest scientists around the globe and
very often they did not find what they
were originally setting out to do there
was roentgens discovery of the x-ray
there was Alexander Fleming discovery of
lysozyme and penicillin and the more
recent example or a manual sharpen Jay
and Geneva dude nos discovery of the
crisp our cusp a system now these two
ladies set out to study a bacterial
defense system a system that protects
the bacteria from certain viruses but
what that finding turned out to be is
the hottest gene editing tool that is
available currently and that has come
out of curiosity driven research and
with the help of this tool in the
not-too-distant future we will be able
to cure genetic diseases and I mean pure
genetic diseases we will be able to
treat certain cancers and that is just
an example of what the value of funding
basic research and as my mentor Nobel
Prize laureate Manfred eigen said
everything that is new has to come from
basic research or else it wouldn&#39;t be
new of course you need to understand the
new that you discover many have seen an
apple fall but only Newton understood
the concept of gravity next important
issue is be creative because creativity
comes from the recognition that there
are alternative ways to see things it is
the power to connect the seemingly
unconnected now there are many examples
for creativity but the one I selected
here was that allows me also to have a
bridge between creativity and
breakthrough innovation because they are
based on very similar principles this
one is from Tim berners-lee and Tim
berners-lee
was a young man only of the age of 25
when he was working in CERN and came up
with a proposal to the to the the chair
of CERN to the director of CERN to
arrange a communication system between
computers that were widespread around
the campus and as you can see the
director of CERN then wrote it&#39;s vague
but exciting and indeed he gave Tim
berners-lee the freedom to continue with
this idea with this concept and we all
know what&#39;s happened the World Wide Web
the internet actually the entire global
communication system has been based on
that particular discovery next one is be
courageous don&#39;t accept a trottin path
courage means you do not accept limits a
friend of mine you
see here Stefan hello we worked at the
same Institute had an interest in light
microscopy now you have to understand
that the resolution power of light
microscopy is half the wavelengths of
light which comes up to about 250
nanometer now Stefan was interested in
increasing the resolution power in
getting more visibility in living
objects and he was actually pretty
criticized by many people around the
globe but he didn&#39;t gave up and so he
developed a tool that he termed
stimulated emission depletion it&#39;s a
system with fluorescence microscopy that
now allows you the resolution to go down
to 20 nanometers so you can literally
see macromolecules in living cells and
while he was criticized and originally
had a say problem finding even jobs he
wouldn&#39;t have this problems today
because in 2014 he received the Nobel
Prize for that finding next is be
critical and seek intellectual input for
your work it is sometimes daunting and
when it&#39;s a little bit afraid of
actively seeking criticism but it is
necessary in order to assure that
quality research is being done the best
is you find mentors and sometimes
mentors can be with you can be partners
for life have a nice anecdote between
two people who I value very highly
friends one is Sydney Brenner and one is
Munford I can boast got the Nobel Prize
in various things and the story goes
like the following Manfred Eicher was
also an accomplished pianist so gay he
gave a piano concert oh and Sydney
Brenner was in the audience sitting next
to a professional piano player in one
Sydney a once month it has was done with
his Mossad performance Sydney asked his
the woman next to him
so what do you think of him she said oh
it&#39;s not bad for a chemist so a day
later
Sidney and Manfred they were strolling
around the Basel it was and Manfred
explained to Sidney his latest theory
about hypercycle in evolutionary biology
so then Manfred our city so Sidney tell
me what do you think of this theory he
said not bad for a pianist so you can
see even at that level you have you need
to understand criticism and you invite
criticism and you will get a lot of
criticisms for your brand applications
for your manuscripts they will be
scrutinized some of them will be
rejected but let that not discourage you
because the peer-review system is not
without flaws publish or perish is very
real and we all know I think it&#39;s not
fair to judge a scientists merit by the
number of publication he is being done
or using matrix of impact factors of
journals but it is a matter of life in
science and we have to live with it in
particular bureaucrats love it because
it&#39;s very easy to just say top medium or
bottom we have to live with it but try
to concentrate on content publications
are necessary for career development why
because they provide a means of
documenting your results and more
importantly they allow others to
reproduce these data and build on them
so innovation and breakthrough
discoveries have only been possible due
to the many experiments that preceded
and publications that preceded them a
Newton once said if I have seen further
it is by standing on the shoulders of
giants
but make sure your work is correct we
hear a lot of fake news or alternate
effects and to me it sometimes appears
that the Enlightenment movement of the
18th century has by has passed by a
great number of people enlightenment as
you know laid the foundation for reason
it&#39;s the primary source of authority and
brought to the world Liberty progress
and formed the basis for democratic
governments there&#39;s nothing like
alternate effects except sometimes when
I step on my scale in the morning I wish
for some alternative facts but for you
guys fake data in science the kiss of
death of a scientific career last point
be concerned be concerned with the
research environment there are
governmental institutions startups this
industry there are philanthropic
organizations they all can provide a
conducive research environment the
research goal of them may be different
but many of these organizations allow
what I like to call high trust funding
and let me explain a little bit high
trust versus low trust funding most
organizations most universities depend
on low trust funding they have to bring
in research funds from grants and
applications peer review however is a
process that depends on ex-ante a priori
predictions regarding the application
consequently it favours mainstream work
not risky projects only half-jokingly
here&#39;s the reason first time you bring
in an application
the referees say it can&#39;t be done you
work on it
submit the second time this application
the argument is well you didn&#39;t do it
right third time you published your
publication you bring in your
application
the argument is well it&#39;s obvious
anyways so it&#39;s very hard to satisfy the
demand of referees a priori and the
general supporting structure does not
support high-risk project that&#39;s why
Stefan Hill Emmanuelle Charpentier or
Tim berners-lee all had high trust
funding for their research in this
research funding is given based on
previous accomplishments believing that
the best scientist will produce the most
important results very simply put front
people not projects that is the essence
of Hydra Stanly of course there is
quality assessment but the quality
assessment is retrospectively and there
are many examples of small pioneering
research organizations that allow for
more creative enterprises as well as
some big companies that actually allow
for basic research being funded
historically there are two very
well-known it&#39;s the Bell Laboratories
and the Institute of immunology in Basel
and there are certain institutional
factors that foster creativity hire the
top scientists and leaders if scientific
independence early on generate small but
interdisciplinary groups with a wide
scientific scope usually the most
efficient group site is eight and give
enough institutional Co funding and
allow external third party income so
what will be your visions what will be
your accomplishments by the time you
reach my age well it&#39;s hard to say of
course and like Peter Sellers the
British comedian once said predicting
the future is a bit like scratching
yourself before being stung but based on
our knowledge today we
to expect progress in sustainable energy
provisions we hope for reduce co2 level
we will have and see intelligence and
autumn autonomous robots which will
result in a lot of labour forces lost in
our productor in our manufacturing
industry we will see a lot of
man-machine interfaces the word is
Internet of Things we will lead longer
and healthier lives some even believe
that the current longest living person
with 120 some is not the absolute limit
that there is no absolute limit but what
is most important does that result in a
happy life well in order to do so of
course you all have to work to take our
society&#39;s along in any case I wish that
with you by the time you retire the
landscape of science will have changed
the world for the better or as the
science philosopher naturalist
politician Francis Bacon several hundred
years ago in other words a more
traditional English has said science
should make the world a better place to
live in and this is my ultimate
invitation to you thank you very much
[Applause]
