well yesterday I was sitting in the
middle of a jungle surrounded by trees
grass plans beautiful flowers all around
me and I noticed one small plant there
which was different from everything else
around it it got my attention and I
wanted to take it back with me but I
also wondered will it still hold that
attractiveness when I remove it from
that environment I realized that to be
beautiful you have to be different from
the rest but it also puts you in the
risk of being plucked out but if you add
to the beauty of the environment by
being that different flower or plant
nobody will pluck you you&#39;ll be
appreciated for who you are well I am
Koyal Rana the 51st woman to win the
title of Femina Miss India the 51st
woman to represent her country at Miss
World a lot of people think that a Miss
India is only successful when she makes
it big in Bollywood I don&#39;t believe that
for me success has a very different
meaning doing what you love making it
big in what you do finding your purpose
and following it living the life that
you&#39;ve dreamt for yourself that&#39;s what
success is for me now all of us want to
be successful in life and we work hard
day and night to be successful we work
the work that we do takes this most of
our time and yet we try to find the
meaning in the work that we do we want
to know where we fit in the big picture
they say do what you love but how often
does it happen then you don&#39;t know what
it is that you love and even if you have
figured it out
life throws so many obstacles at you to
throw you off the track and you&#39;re lost
again trying to find purpose in life
trying to find meaning in life to top it
all you&#39;re getting old the feeling that
the time is running out takes over you
your hair starts to fall out your face
is covered with wrinkles the happy glow
that once radiated from your face has
just disappeared you&#39;re tired now
Saturday nights out have turned into
chillin at home or sleeping in gathering
all the energy that you need to start
the week again well I have for you five
stages where I will want to share with
you the steps in how to find your
purpose how to understand yourself and
use those things to control your energy
stupid to me in the mode of self
transformation stage one is the most
difficult stage of all belief belief in
yourself accepting for whatever you are
right in this moment I wasn&#39;t born
perfect I&#39;ve had my imperfections I&#39;ve
had my weaknesses that I have walked on
on a period of time I always wanted to
be a Miss India and I loved wearing
crowns my weakness was communication for
a major part of my life I could not
speak in English when I changed my
school in nine standard it was the first
interaction that I had with students who
were talking in English with me and I
would just quietly sit in a corner
scared to make a conversation too proud
to admit that I can&#39;t speak
the language of the elite in this
country I&#39;m very grateful to HBO and
Star Movies for introducing subtitles on
TV they were my first teachers before
that I did not understand English movies
and when I finally finally decided to
participate in Miss India I had a tough
time coping with all the girls who were
so good with their English they had such
a strong command over this language and
every day my weakness was pulling me
down but that did not stop me I knew who
I was I believed in myself I believe in
the worst I believed in the hard work
that I put in for myself to make myself
worthy of that title and that belief
radiated through me and one the belief
of the judges and finally that crown but
it doesn&#39;t end here just believing in
yourself once you have to be consistent
with your beliefs you have to keep
loving yourself every day after I won I
was criticized from left right and
center all over the internet people
started telling me what I&#39;m bad at what
I can&#39;t do and I made their words my
reality I stopped believing in who I was
I started hating myself
but
I still went on to Miss World with the
hope that I had that probably there&#39;s
something left in me but there wasn&#39;t
and after Miss World I had no idea how
to pick myself up my life was a complete
blur people who believed in me were now
finding faults in me and I don&#39;t blame
them because if you don&#39;t believe in
yourself nobody else will States to
understanding yourself through
silver-lining when you lost in life and
you have to find your way back in it&#39;s a
very hard task it&#39;s a difficult journey
you have to forget the negativity you
have to see everything that&#39;s happened
in your life with a positive outlook and
when you do that you start understanding
why those things happen they happened to
make to be able to make you stand where
you are today it shaped you into who you
are today
when I spend time with MA with
underprivileged children working for
them I noticed that they had so much
more than I did they were happier than
me they didn&#39;t care about what&#39;s coming
tomorrow or what people think about them
my male presence with them I&#39;m a
interaction with them made them happy
and I didn&#39;t realize it then the power
that I had the power to create happiness
in another person&#39;s life in the whole
negative phase that I was living in I
stopped seeing who I was I forgot who I
was how many of us get a whole speech
dedicated just to us at your college
Farrell how many of us when we go back
to our school are given a grand welcome
how many of us get to inspire thousands
of people around the world how many of
us get to give a TED talk and I can go
on keep on counting my blessings that I
have been
bestow&#39;d because each moment every
moment that I was given in my life be it
bad or good I am grateful for each of
them because that is what shaped me who
I am today listen to the past whenever
something from the past bothers me I
don&#39;t try to shun it away I try to think
analyse why is it coming and coming back
again and again
what is this past memory trying to tell
me what is it trying to teach me and I
always find a lesson and I&#39;m at peace
with myself
and with that memory Stage three is
convinced you have to master the first
two stages and when you do that when you
start believing in yourself and you
understand who you are you come to stage
three controlling your energies the
three steps that will help you do that
step one is the connection of the soul
mind and body let&#39;s start with water
connection is with the mind and the body
a body has taken its own control over
ourselves it wants to do whatever it
feels like doing the mind says let&#39;s get
this proposal done the body says nah I&#39;m
a little tired maybe later the mind
knows that this is what this is an
important task and it needs to be done
right now but it just gives in to the
wishes of the body and it happened in so
many things and so many our daily
activities and because of this the mind
and the body connection the switch is
always on only when this switch turns
off will your mind connect with the soul
now how do you do that and the soul is
waiting back there waiting just so this
disconnection stopped so it can feed all
the information it can help you guide
you and tell you where and how
give you solutions to your mind so to
break this connection you have to
completely give up anything that your
body tells you to do
you can do it right now stay still do
not move any part of your body do not
try to adjust your body do not try to
make yourself comfortable or an itch do
not try to get rid of that it&#39;s just
pure stillness and you&#39;ll feel it when
your body will completely give up you
will stop feeling your body will cease
to exist for you and in this moment your
soul with suddenly connect with the mind
and you&#39;ll realize where you are who you
are where you have to go from here and
what you have to do now this is how you
discipline your mod body in stillness
the other way to disciplining your body
isn&#39;t movement that is done through yoga
which I won&#39;t be covering right now so
when you do these are when you
discipline your body completely the more
it&#39;s disciplined the more the stronger
the connection of the mind and the soul
is where does the soul get its
information or its message now
the earth connecting with the earth the
earth has food to fuel both all three
things the soul the mind and the body
from the food that you eat from the air
that you breathe the land that you walk
on when you pray you bow down because to
be able to connect to the universe you
have to first connect to the earth Lord
Shiva is known to draw his energy and
knowledge from Earth
the closer you are to nature the closer
you will feel to your purpose so travel
eat the more if you eat raw and more
naturally available food your soul will
get its message in the purest form your
body and mind will get its energy to do
whatever work that you need to be done
stage for understanding youth in this
stage you understand what youth is and
why do you want to stay young a young
person is full of life and full of
energy a young person has a healthy body
and a healthy mind a young person is
happy and cheerful and when you have a
purpose in life and you know where
you&#39;re going you will get all the energy
that you need to perform all the tasks
that you need to be need when you eat
healthy diet you will have a healthy
mind and a healthy body and when you
have all of that you will be happy and
cheerful but what if you are not for
you&#39;re not on the right path and you
don&#39;t know what your purpose is and you
stop living that life your energy source
will be cut down the universe will stop
investing in you and will cut down on
the energy that is for you to stay young
now stage 5 is the Cabana Vika vana is
the Sanskrit word which means a constant
state of self transformation when you
master the previous four stages you
reach a state you reach the ability to
be to transform yourself constantly
now this word is derived from certain
words V which in Sanskrit means
different directions there is no limit
to how far you can go to what fields you
can go you can expand as much as you
want you can transform into different
personalities whenever the need arises
Curl Curl in Sanskrit means to perform
you will have all the energy that you
need when you learn to control your
energies and you&#39;ll be able to perform
the tasks at hand vana is a beautiful
word with a beautiful meaning sound the
sound that you will make the music that
your work will make let it resonate let
it be heard let it inspire the people
around you be in worker vana and stay
young for as long as you want
