hi so in 2005 I was working at my dream
job I was a local TV news producer at a
Media Markt station in New England and I
had worked so hard for this job and I
loved it so much that I was willing to
wake up at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning
every day to go to work
I would interview local politicians
community leaders business owners about
important issues like what do you think
of property taxes how is the new highway
gonna impact your business so one day my
boss comes to me and says Ricky go get
this story heated car seats can be
dangerous I am very sure she wanted me
to come back with a story that looked
like this there is a philosophy in news
if it bleeds it leads we wanted to grab
eyeballs because the more eyeballs we
have the more expensive advertising we
can sell I spent the next couple of days
calling ambulance chaser attorneys
asking about exploding car seats all of
them told me that I was reaching a
little too hard for a story that wasn&#39;t
there and still my boss wanted to grab
attention and wallets she wasn&#39;t
particularly concerned with giving
people news that could help them I
believe the news should help us I also
believe that the news used to do a lot
better job of giving us information that
helped us rather than just trying to
make money and I believe that this is a
big reason why we no longer trust the
news media they don&#39;t seem to really
want to help us they want to hold our
attention to sell ads the good news is
that I think that we can fix this in a
broader sense I think that we can fix
the news and restore the implied
contract that it has with the public
a contract is just an agreement between
parties in this case the public and the
news media today I no longer do stories
about exploding car seats
I do pledge breaks I work for in Atlanta
and PR affiliate as an on-air
broadcaster and I hope that when I turn
on the microphone every afternoon people
trust me because they know that I&#39;m
trying to give them stories that add to
their lives
Trust is a contract it&#39;s an unspoken
agreement that a person or an
organization will respect your best
interests we had an unspoken agreement
with the news media it is pretty clear
that that contract of trust is broken
look at these numbers less than a
quarter of Americans say that they trust
the news apply that to this room
everybody from this aisle over would
think that the news media was full of it
now not trusting the news media may not
seem like a big deal in your day-to-day
life but think about all of the
decisions that you make every day based
on information that you consider
trustworthy you pick out clothes to wear
in the morning based on the weather
report that is trust you decide to buy a
food item at the grocery store based on
the information on the package that is
trust when it comes to the news media
that contract of trust helps us decide
how we&#39;re going to vote how we want our
tax dollars spent whether or not our
family members and friends in the
military and the thousands of other
Americans should go to war so when we
make any decision based on outside
information we need to be able to trust
it we saw an example of this with
hurricanes Harvey and Maria and Irma in
the days leading up to the storms
millions of people needed accurate
information that they considered trust
so that they could prepare to keep
themselves and their loved ones safe and
still false news was circulating one
email claimed that rainfall and flooding
amounts were wrong another widely shared
Facebook post claimed that the news
media was downplaying the size of the
storms with lies at stake with our
finances at stake arguably with our
democracy at stake why do so few people
trust the news I believe it&#39;s because
this balance has subtly shifted the news
media doesn&#39;t seem to really want to
help us they seem more interested in
keeping our attention to sell ads the
economics of this mean that the news
media can&#39;t really rely any more on
advertisements and revenue and
subscriptions many outlets are now
largely paid with your attention it&#39;s
actually called the attention economy we
all know what this looks like we have
all heard of clickbait we&#39;ve all clicked
on clickbait these 20 animals net worth
will make you gasp for breath it&#39;s
ridiculous and it works you click on
this and the sponsor makes money I
clicked on it
mainstream TV news is not immune from
this type of luring of eyeballs in
August 2014 during a news broadcast the
anchors at Fox 5 WNYW New York were
cheering as the meteorologist comes out
and proceeds to take off his shirt and
flex his well tone muscles I clicked on
that video but simply giving you
information so that you can understand
the world better no longer keeps the
news media and business we can fix this
we can restore our contract of trust of
the news it&#39;s as simple as supply and
demand we can demand that the news media
help us so how can we do this I have
five ideas for you today
number one distinguish between news and
journalism seek out information sources
that take more time to explain things to
you because when it comes to
understanding the world shorter is not
sweeter in 2012
80% of local TV news stories were less
than a minute how can you understand
anything in 55 seconds journalism takes
time to explain the whole story with
multiple perspectives
news is just new information when we
demand more informative stories we
encourage the news media to supply us
with longer deeper storytelling number
two up for fact over opinion Talking
Heads now dominate home pages and
newscasts as of five years ago
commentary and opinion had crept up to
63% of national cable news opinion
aiders understand the issues well enough
for them to tell you what they think
how can you honestly know what you think
without the facts the context the
reporting when we demand information
over opinion we push the news media to
supply us with journalism over
Talking Heads number three yes get out
of your echo chamber be aware of what
people you disagree with they&#39;re saying
and be genuinely curious why on social
media go ahead and follow thought
leaders politicians activists with whom
you disagree and click on their posts
when we demand to understand opposing
viewpoints we motivate the news media to
supply us with balanced objective
reporting number four go global consider
frequenting international news sources
you will very quickly see that people
elsewhere in the world see thinks so
differently than we do here at home now
ideas from far away may seem irrelevant
but they give you a very good idea of
where we stand in a global conversation
when we demand international
perspectives we embolden the news media
to supply us with a broader scope of
ideas and perspectives and number five
and certainly the simplest yep go out
and buy one of these when was the last
time any of us paid for our news most of
us don&#39;t but if we want the news media
to supply us with information that helps
us we have got to free them from having
to hold our attention with scandal and
sensationalism and downright silly
stories we have got to break the news
out of the attention economy nine out of
ten adults say that they get their news
online subscribe to an online journalism
website donate to a non-profit
television station or go out and buy a
newspaper and here&#39;s a great way to pay
it forward consider giving subscriptions
to family and friends for holiday and
birthday presents or donate to your
child&#39;s school this is our modern day
example of the power of the purse when
we pay for our news
we are demanding that the news media
supply us with journalism over clickbait
analysis over Papa paths now the news
media&#39;s got to do their part too and
that means addressing the elephant in
the room and the donkey which is that
the news media is politically and
socially polarizing right now
I was recently giving a speech about the
state of a news media to a group of
Roman Catholic priests in Charleston
South Carolina I was wrapping up my
remarks and taking questions and a fan
in the back raised his hand and he said
I was just wondering how many
conservatives work in your newsroom I
told him I don&#39;t know the political
leanings of my colleagues but I
understood his point he is among
millions of Americans and many of you
may be among them who don&#39;t feel that
they&#39;re seeing conservative viewpoints
adequately represented in the news media
the people who work in the news media
meant for all Americans need to reflect
all Americans news executives talk all
day long about adding diversity among
staff and contributors in terms of
things like race and gender and sexual
identity all of that is incredibly vital
how well our newsroom is doing
prioritizing diversity of political
thought when you see your political
ideas reflected in the news media you
are more likely to trust the news media
so it&#39;s so easy to be angry even really
frustrated there&#39;s other words for it
about the news media right now this
isn&#39;t the worst that&#39;s ever been who
here has heard of Orson Welles in the
War of the Worlds
the worst that has ever been made
possibly have been October 30th 1938
aliens landed on Grover&#39;s mill New
Jersey and dispatch to take over the
world
mass hysteria ensued people thronged
police stations demanding to be
evacuated those who couldn&#39;t handle the
shock dropped out of a heart attack
others tried suicide at least that&#39;s
what the post and The Times and other
newspapers reported the truth is that
the great American storyteller Orson
Welles had simply aired a very
frightening radio drama after all it was
almost Halloween some people expressed
concern sure but most understood the
disclaimers during War of the Worlds
that it was fictional entertainment and
still the newspapers kept churning out
these stories very likely in an effort
to discredit their new rival in the news
business the very new technology of
radio we also live in an era of
unprecedented technological upheaval
that&#39;s transforming the ways in which we
communicate
of course we&#39;re confused about who to
trust what has not changed is the power
of the free market consumers have
incredible influence over the news media
supply always follows demand we are the
demand and just like those listeners in
1938
who knew that War of the Worlds was just
a good bit of Halloween fun we are so
much smarter than the news media gives
us credit for let&#39;s harness the tried
and true forces of the free market to
demand that the news media stop reducing
the very serious and very complex issues
of our day to mindless clickbait shallow
headlines
in partisan sensationalism we deserve
news that helps us make better sense of
the world around us let&#39;s restore our
contract of trust in the news media by
helping the news media help us let&#39;s
restore our trust in the news thank you

you
