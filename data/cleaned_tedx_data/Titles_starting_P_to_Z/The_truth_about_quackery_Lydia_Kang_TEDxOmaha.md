I brought a friend today this is George
George is a leech to be specific he is a
European medicinal leech it&#39;s been very
interesting living with George lately
it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve had a pet in
our home that looks to us not as the
provider of dinner but dinner itself so
leeches like George have been used for a
millennia for countless treatments under
the Sun if you had a stomach ache for
example you would have leeches applied
to your belly if you had a raging case
of gonorrhea you might have upwards to
50 leeches applied to your testicles
so
anybody have a headache today would you
like George to chew on your temple and
fix that yeah I see a lot of shaking
heads clearly we have come a long way
for example in the 18th century tobacco
was used as a treatment for victims of
drowning in the Thames river in England
specifically tobacco smoke enemas that&#39;s
right they used to think that blowing
smoke up your ass was an actual
legitimate way to save you from being
almost dead and don&#39;t worry I am NOT
going to ask for volunteers for that one
for centuries
Egyptian mummies were stolen from tombs
ground-up mixed with myrrh and spices
and used as a treatment for a ringworm
or the plague and that wasn&#39;t the only
kind of corpse and cannibalistic
medicine out there human fat harvested
from the recently executed was a
treatment for things like aching joints
and symptoms of rabies they called it
man&#39;s grease or hangman&#39;s self and my
favorite poor sinners fat as recently as
the early 20th century radioactive water
was sold as a health tonic and some of
the drinkers became so radioactive that
on their death they were buried and
lead-lined coffins like I said we have
come a long way we know so much more
about the human body now there was a
time when some anatomist actually
thought that air ran through our blood
vessels instead of blood the uterus was
once thought for well over a thousand
years to be this misbehaving organ that
ran around hither and thither inside a
woman&#39;s body cavity wreaking havoc like
a dog without a bleach
and the only way to make it behave was
to lure it into place with some sweet
smelling herbs waved down near her
nether regions we now have so much a
better idea of things like infectious
diseases we understand better how things
like Ebola travel through our bodies and
across continents we know that gold
elixirs will not magically cure us of
alcoholism and that implanted monkey and
goat glands is are not going to revive a
man&#39;s waning libido
I mean surgeons actually wash their
hands before surgery and believe it or
not that was not always the case so if
we have come so far why is it that there
is a multi-billion dollar industry of
unproven often useless and occasionally
dangerous treatments out there so I have
a couple answers for this but first a
story it&#39;s about me and my hair so for a
couple decades now I am the person
responsible in my household for leaving
wads of hair in the shower drain call it
genetics call it telogen effluvium which
is a fancy word for my hair sheds in
cycles so much more than a golden
retriever but what I do know is that
when I flip open my computer these ads
will pop up because the all-knowing
internet knows me better than I know
myself
and it&#39;ll try to sell me these new hair
shampoos and vitamins and laser cannons
that promise to turn me into Chewbacca
if I just click on the click bait and
hand over my credit card now depending
on how much hair I&#39;ve been shutting that
morning I might actually click on some
of them I might even buy some of them so
here&#39;s a little context I am a
practicing physician of internal
medicine I know how to do a medical
literature search and I know how to read
that medical literature better than the
average American it&#39;s part of my job
with my co-author Nate Peterson we
actually wrote an entire book on the
history of quack medicine so in a
nutshell when it comes to hair loss
scheme&#39;s i really should know better so
why is it that all of us can be so
susceptible to these unproven and
occasionally fraudulent quack remedies
out there now
well there&#39;s one there&#39;s one obvious
reason which is that you know we don&#39;t
know everything about the human body as
a result of that we don&#39;t have a cure
for everything that can go wrong in it
and that leaves a lot of room for quacks
to fill the void with their products a
second reason is bias so bias is this
incredibly powerful force that affects
every single one of us let&#39;s say for
instance you really want to lose some
weight and your two trusted friends
swear that swallowing tapeworm eggs will
do the trick so you buy them - that&#39;s
called the bandwagon effect let&#39;s say
you really want to work on your
complexion
so you fork over 50 dollars to pay for
these great arsenic wafers and after you
spent the money you think it was really
expensive but it&#39;s good stuff it must
work right that&#39;s post purchase
rationalization and those are only two
of many many different biases that we
are affected by all the time but here&#39;s
the more complicated answer as to why
quackery is still vividly alive today
it&#39;s hope now don&#39;t get me wrong hope is
incredibly important I mean we can&#39;t
wake up in the morning without hope we
wouldn&#39;t have eradicated smallpox or
saved countless heart attack victims
without it I mean it&#39;s one of the things
that makes us so human isn&#39;t it I mean
George isn&#39;t hoping for good weather
tomorrow or an optimal cholesterol level
but hope can be a little intoxicating
and like certain intoxicants it can
alter your ability to critically
evaluate treatments and cures that are
out there sometimes
I wish the word came with a big warning
label hope can be hazardous to your
health
you see our health is part of our
identity it&#39;s deeply personal
and when we are making decisions about
our healthcare it&#39;s not always a
subjective choosing of this versus that
it is personal and it can be an
emotional process and so when something
in our body goes awry and our immune
system starts attacking us and we now
have a diagnosis of lupus or rheumatoid
arthritis it&#39;s not the body that we felt
we had before and we want so much to get
back to normal or a new normal as soon
as possible I know what it&#39;s like to
give bad news
the biopsy result is cancer it&#39;s time to
talk about dialysis and I know what it&#39;s
like to receive bad news
Lydia there is a spot on your ovary and
it doesn&#39;t look exactly benign aside
from the shock of how can this be
happening to me there&#39;s this
overwhelming desire to find that normal
to find a solution as soon as possible
and so you take this potent mix of
emotions fear feeling lost and you add
hope which is so important but it can be
a little bit like wearing a pair of
rose-colored glasses and suddenly when
you pop open your computer and these ads
are there promising you exactly what you
need exactly the moment you need them
how can you say no so we as physicians
have to understand that making medical
decisions for for our patients might not
be as obvious to us as far as the answer
as we think it might be when they&#39;re
coming from this place of vulnerability
and we as patients have to understand
that hope can change us in ways that we
don&#39;t expect it can make us both are
both our best advocates for ourselves
and our worst enemy so going back to
George here I know that the subject of
today&#39;s talks are everything changes and
in so many cases it really has I mean
we&#39;re no longer snacking on corpses or
performing lobotomies but until there
are safe and free and easy treatments
for every medical problem then quackery
is always going to be there and as long
as we have hope then snake oil salesmen
are going to feed voraciously on its
optimism
I&#39;m not saying that you shouldn&#39;t have
hope I&#39;m just saying that your emotional
state of mind might make George here a
little bit more attractive than he
should be
thank you very much
[Applause]
