I see a lot of my students kiss young
[Music]
[Music]
yeah I need a desktop maybe this is what
you machinee the spirit who skip are
very courageous I pushed should be
[Music]
[Applause]
yes very good
I know Lincoln I can give it up
wallpaper cannot discover stupid it&#39;s a
winner we want somewhere in the body
what exactly is the difference I mean
one is a machine
the other is machine as well the
difference is parts this is more than a
machine this is a part of my personality
this is an extension of my personality
or jitney the engineering design
mechanic is at the end that is revolving
around parts rather than agility I see a
lot of Engineers in this film and sure
they would appreciate this
are you done yet what is that reason
any ideas
or how would a scientists define art I
see a lot of engineers who are artists
and it helps for community said I&#39;m
Cinnabon everyone be ready what select
together get your innocence
above it or it&#39;s a very special kind of
work that&#39;s not actually what that game
special special because it has a nice
peak or it uses it to hunt pickup fish
and bring it to its chicks
so the skate scientist Nick and Emily
explain me what it is not a tiny package
design this was actual research and they
throw it to the bucket seats the coffee
chicks got excited
grating babies because this is the
patentee associated with food from from
this is the pattern look you would keep
branding branding state whose if I can
go wouldn&#39;t equate the diver or
paychecks go the time and this is really
great insight get back to these inmates
asleep and get back from the perspective
of the chicks
this is fun this is design what triggers
your emotions all humans as humans will
be watered
illogical can I shook here the money too
friendly movie speed and we can stinky
who spoke our commitment and when you
should look at those paintings you will
get excited because when you see over
there food money ticket or true in some
reticle together are
money needs my psychology vodka this
Afghan cave of they&#39;re speeding it up in
it
I&#39;m gonna take art city or self camera
system but it&#39;s all over Linda generic
in fact it is what dictates you see an
emotion you see an aversion to this car
number one car degree to which color you
buy one probably okay because it&#39;s a
smiling face number two probably not
because it&#39;s an aggressive pace and that
decision comes from your inner instinct
liking is finding Facebook and I think
of a face that might not be true for our
cases ligand Giannini engineering
mechanical engineering could be a
evolutionary biology sitting through
linking it with that way you&#39;re able to
stop very very stark forces most why do
we do you know who designed it for
anything
pregnant horse designed it on Hitler in
a way when it came to Hitler little in
the skate circle with sausage instantly
and Hitler I&#39;d say was an artist
observer because everything about you
was perfectly designed from the box
final push Chabad so emblem Kiba juice
caboose - tea or juice SOT that was all
a part of a greater design of a great
artist equality very famous
many better stuff you know what makes a
business by either psychology meant when
it catches in teen get gapped these
people do money instinct oh that&#39;s
better
what the presiding deity is a preclude a
design team Volkswagen biomega
meaning design we the media sites
what&#39;s that like about 90 okay it was
only after a lot of time of research
they found oh it&#39;s a mini head those
people OSHA&#39;s toward a superstar because
with us anything but not yet and then a
be this repair is what I suppose are not
working
interesting in fact research on TV on
how engineering courts are connected to
technology and how engineering works are
completed by now and scientists have
figured out who is serviced at IKEA you
know do you know Coco babyface huarache
Coco baby this without cake are you
aggressive monarchy being pinaki and
they found out okay again
construction construction destroyed you
the 80 people just like you who paid 100
engineering assignment and they found
out they had to survey the random match
I myself and can you realize what the
other is Omar c6
and not only that
Jozef on so that you see some kind of an
emotional responsiveness all these
products here Escobar this is what I try
to go just about the substrate
effectively we started studying or piece
of art the back sonic travel it&#39;s a
marvel of it it&#39;s a mother of art in
itself
mauve it&#39;s ready to see a tear of
evolution is on a wall or it s a
completely original Eden it&#39;ll just
blacken in the pocket
I mean exactly what it started out this
simply talked of a great foot traffic
coming your dream or something that that
can best be true and I&#39;ll tell you why
because it&#39;s more consistency it started
out as an easier than 9,600 okay you
Casey
for a fast escape a book who came to
sweep it needs at the qualifications
okay if this is how it ended up what we
see today all jumbled Misco as part of
our search yet steady commercial here in
camo participate yellow practically
factors take Yahoo you did in fact
escape oh gosh human instilled to
produce great clarity is kalispera Brian
vanilla is immediately radiant easy
coach meeting was all it was all piece
of human psychology we went out there
we started asking people questions yet
this male pajamas are back in our area
numata is made multiple subunits so
little to go to ability to score
division when we started doing our
surveys Hassan Yousef is getting it and
this is where we conquer a huge net
trust by Sangha whoa it bought it was
you know what you Katie primarily
designed like Sandman high quality high
quality
stable job region 1980s name evolve oq
school pajamas a karate match a lotta
stupid eat less than green or pill
revolutionary
who&#39;s gay bar I stop I start with design
evolution keep it up like yeah ok cool
who here loosen each okay ap pocket it&#39;s
all gasp usefulness of these a release
it over towers banana sugar and we go a
please psychological leaves of power in
respect of the product it is very
exciting people who are doing is scale
just the work you do get e-commerce I
kept Ignacio credit is simply evolution
differently with job revolution
differently Horace Kaiba just a
liquidity Baja peoples are even
and it was the human form of themselves
which they were doing in drag and why do
I have to tell you this because
engineering is driven by data and theory
of evolution me you see there are three
food technology believe it was that you
see we I started my degree started
making bicycles and I thought is you
know fit three bicycles milonga this
thing is faster by 70 metres per hour
and we thought we&#39;d wait wait marvel of
engineering we couldn&#39;t sell it miss
Kazue land speed record head on my life
with the world net sleeper record for
such a bike is this is 147 kilometres
per hour
we can we party this would be a great
idea is psy congroo from Iraqi bitch
about it
Hey - I really come here with a great
set we call by tonight we&#39;re a company
out of it whose core base Nico should be
marketed or should be
they BD means are or designs behind
language and what we found out something
very very interesting to you by 1936 in
a design creepy and this is the race in
the nineteen thirties or the first this
entered this white one secondaries it&#39;s
the generated one in service saris then
you record sorry cycling reports for the
evening
and get this
could not make it to the mainstream we
will just wouldn&#39;t buy it and you know
what yes
lack of art revolution lack of biology
escape we recently nested is a big
reason to author search about Sunday we
give human beings the world to walk
upright and by evolution of bicycle
which was done will not work because
people will not prefer line down the
road or food technology will dictate
that that rather than performance itself
shall be strong about the pathology or
just giving Pradhan bit chilled
instilling design that occurs through
Carnegie was probably in the future what
we can do is we can predict our future
and we can predict what kind of
technology will be successful what kind
of marketing plans will be successful
what kind will not be successful just by
bringing arts into engineering itself
and on the like you know this is what my
future looks like
