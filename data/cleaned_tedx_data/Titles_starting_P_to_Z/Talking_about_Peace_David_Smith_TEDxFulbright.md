1969 from Woodstock maybe some folks in
this audience went to food stock I don&#39;t
know but often when we think about peace
images of the 1960s kind of come to the
fore the 1960s were a really seminal
time for Americans we acted on our
passions to make really significant
changes in the areas of social justice
in the areas of advocating for peace
well we think of peace sometimes these
images are what we conjure up we think
about the hippie culture or peaceniks we
think about freedom we think about music
and that&#39;s all appropriate but as our
society has progressed s-- the images of
peace have changed and lately what has
happened is what were images of
peacefulness in thinking about what
peace means sometimes turn to violence
people who engage a non non-violent
civic action are people that work very
hard to make sure that the people that
they have working with them stay the
course but sometimes things go off the
rails sometimes people are not trained
and nonviolent civic action and
sometimes they&#39;re interlopers that show
up and make changes that are unexpected
and be quite frank with you recently
sometimes there&#39;s heavy handedness from
law enforcement this is from Ferguson in
2014 and this was the end of the day
when the day started with peaceful
protests after the election in November
lots of high school students around the
country were upset about the result
there were high school students who were
also pleased with the result I know in
my own County Montgomery County Maryland
students got together and many of them
walked out the day after or two days
after school in school that&#39;s very near
by a 100 students decided to walk out of
school in protest the election there
were also students that walked out in
support of the election results and the
students had planned this had planned
this to be a peaceful protest they had
permission from the principal permission
from the school board but what are not
happening is when the two groups
converged in front of the County
Courthouse there was a fight and it was
the fight that became the news that
evening one student slugged another
student the students and came to me and
some other of my colleagues who work
with our city&#39;s Human Rights Commission
and say look we need training we need to
be able to do this better we need to be
able to avoid this type of violence when
it comes to engaging in non violent
conflict this is really important what
we&#39;re looking at here is we&#39;re thinking
about how to go about make change this
is a photograph of Mahatma Gandhi at the
time he was not Mahatma he was Mohandas
K Gandhi this is from 1909 when he was a
polished London educated barrister still
in South Africa five years later he
would go to India and change the world
he would never look like this again as
you know he would Don the garbs of
Indians and dress very modestly one of
the things that Gandhi said which I want
ways to think about is as the means so
the end what Gandhi was saying to us was
how we go about things reflects our
morality our morality of justice or
reality of honesty or reality of
truthfulness or reality is peacefulness
we can&#39;t always for sure predict the
outcome but if we use the right means
the right means will often get us to the
right ends no one can argue the fact
that we live in a violent society we
live in a society where violence
permeates everything that we do we live
in a society where
it&#39;s hard for us to get away from the
violence that&#39;s all around us it&#39;s hard
for us to get away from the notion that
guns are a way that people make
decisions at times it&#39;s part of our
culture and violence is something that
even today was something that we dealt
with in Washington when member of
Congress was shot people who work for
peace increasingly use the word peace
building to describe the work that they
do peace building is the process and the
effort by which we look at means and we
look at ends to reflect a society where
human rights are respected where a
living wage is ensured or equality
between people who have advantages and
those that don&#39;t have the advantages or
even doubt where social justice values
are encouraged where poverty is
alleviated peacebuilding envisions
universal values of community universal
values of love universal values of
welfare for 30 years I spent my time
working mostly with college and high
school students in promoting peace and
conflict resolution I was very fortunate
in my career when I was at a community
college to go overseas as a youthful
u.s. Fulbright Scholar and went to
Estonia and I was fortunate because very
few Community College faculty have an
opportunity to engage and participate in
the Fulbright Program in my case I took
my whole family along I think many of
you might have gone on your own but the
advantages of taking your family along
probably faint are fantastic in our case
my wife and I took our three-year-old
daughter and our nine-year-old son
overseas and I changed not only us but
it changed our children in very very
pronounced ways I came back from that
experience and then I left my Community
College and started working in
Washington DC for the United States
Institute of Peace at the u.s. Institute
of Peace I spent most of my time
traveling around the United
dates working with college students and
college faculty to promote the teaching
of peace and conflict resolution with
them often I would be in a session with
college students and we would talk about
peace and we talked about social justice
and we would engage in activities and
very interactive and lots of fun and so
forth and then we&#39;d have questions and
answers and the questions were always
how do I get a job working for a piece
sometimes they&#39;d raise their hand and
say how can I get your job and it wasn&#39;t
always an easy question to answer
because rent with you it isn&#39;t easily
identify I&#39;ve spent the last couple of
years writing a book to try to answer
some of those questions but one of the
things that I remind students is the way
you go about doing things is the ability
and is important to your ability to
making peace around the world the means
as the means so the ends it&#39;s really
hard today to be a college student
college students have stress stress
stress right it&#39;s the stress of peers is
the stress of leaving home sometimes
that stressful and parents too leaving
home I know I have a high school
daughter who&#39;s going on to college and
my wife and I are grappling with her
leaving home and she&#39;s been on high
stress since the first day of high
school but making decisions about sexual
mores and avoiding drug use and the
pressures from peers and choosing the
right major oh my gosh is one thing
after another I&#39;m just I&#39;m waiting for
her to deal with all of this and often
maybe frequently hanging over a
student&#39;s head is this cloud this cloud
of when I graduate what will I do and
how am I going to pay off that average
forty thousand dollar debt some students
is two hundred thousand dollars and it&#39;s
due six months after you graduate so for
anybody here who just graduated just to
remind you December&#39;s your first payment
college is also a time of expiration
it&#39;s a time when students start to find
out about themselves about their vow
about what&#39;s important to them they get
that space to think into dream they get
that that space to be inspired by
speakers and by each other they get that
space to kind of paint the perfect world
the world that they want to do and that
is really important also today one third
of American workers are millenials and
by 2025 75% will be in Millennials so
it&#39;s really important for us to know
what are the values of millenials how do
they see the world how do they operate
in the world recently the intelligence
group did a study and found that 88% of
Millennials would rather engage in
collaboration than competition to get
things done they&#39;d rather collaborate
than compete it&#39;s very interesting
because we seem to think we live in a
society where competition is the be-all
and end-all and 64% of Millennials say I
want to make positive change in the
world I want to make a difference in the
world that&#39;s really important it&#39;s
important when you think that after the
election in November surveys came out
and the one that I remember particular
was the Pew Research survey that said 86
percent of Americans think we are more
divided than ever more than divided than
ever it&#39;s a significant division in our
country Robert Putnam in his 2000 book
Bowling Alone talked about the fact that
civic spaces in the United States have
shrunk and shrunk and shrunk that going
to PTA meetings or going to civic
associations are not things that people
do anymore and as a result the
opportunities to discourse and to
converse and to talk with people is not
as present as they once were
before dialogue is not complicated but
often we think about conversing with
someone is a matter of beating them over
the head with our point of view into
submission so that they agree with us
that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about it&#39;s about
conversing with people to reach
understanding
to open our hearts to what they&#39;re
saying so that we ourselves can learn
about what they&#39;re saying this is what
dialogue is all about in 2014
August of 2014 I was invited to st.
Louis Community College and I was
invited to the campus that&#39;s in Ferguson
Missouri there&#39;s only one college in
Ferguson and it&#39;s a community college
and the community college is
predominately african-american like the
city and I was invited to come to spend
time with faculty and students to work
with them and to think about a plan
moving forward of what the college could
do and so I spent two days meeting with
students and faculty and I remember the
first day I had a meeting with a group
of students I only remember what
happened the meeting that eyed students
from that campus and then we brought
students and from another campus that
was a predominantly white campus to join
them st. Louis has pretty racially
divided so kind of north from part of
st. Louis african-american and southern
part of st. Louis&#39;s mostly white I
remember after the meeting I was talking
to college and I was peering out of the
corner of my eye and watching another
conversation going on and there were two
young women probably about 18 years old
african-american young lady white young
later they&#39;re having a conversation and
the African young woman is explaining to
her fellow student what&#39;s been going on
in Ferguson very intently telling her
what&#39;s been going on and the white
student is asking questions very simple
I will bet that they will not soon
forget that conversation but we don&#39;t
have conversations like that we don&#39;t
have conversations that get into
somebody else&#39;s space and learn about
their sufferings and their traumas and
their tribulations and what they&#39;re
doing people live in isolation even
going on college campuses the next day I
met with a group of african-american men
who are part of a group called the
african-american male initiative these
were african-american men who&#39;d come
back to college and were in college
order to work in order to make change in
their community and I remember having
one conversation in particular with one
young man who is 18 years old in this 18
year-old man told me about an experience
he had had previously the week before
when he and his wife girlfriend had been
traveling another part of st. Louis and
then pulled over by police officer and
the police officer said to those white
girlfriend why are you dating him you
should be dating me talk about
humiliation what was important to me was
not just the conversation itself but
what was important to me is having the
conversation because as you can see I&#39;m
a white man of a certain age and police
brutality is not something that I&#39;ve
experienced and what I hear about it as
I hear about on the Washington Post or
listen to it on the NewsHour so having
this conversation with somebody who&#39;s
had this experience was very valuable to
me
I still talk about negotiation with
students this is also important to think
about that we negotiate all day long and
the things that we do in everything that
we do and I remind students that
negotiation is something that&#39;s really
valuable on how they go about their day
so I say the students say you and your
girlfriend or boyfriend want to go to
the movies tomorrow night and you want
to go see frozen you know for the
umpteenth time that song you know let it
go let it go you just can&#39;t let it go
those of you have kids know what I&#39;m
talking about and your partner wants
that go see the Texas Chainsaw Massacre
or anybody ever seen that okay it&#39;s a
cult movie in college so you&#39;re thinking
oh you could say that&#39;s the end of our
relationship right that&#39;s it it&#39;s not
probably what&#39;s gonna happen you&#39;re
gonna try to negotiate with each other
to figure out the relationship so what
are you gonna do maybe we&#39;ll find a
movie that&#39;s a little bit like both of
those two movies hmm maybe or maybe what
we&#39;ll do is we won&#39;t go out tonight you
go out with your friends and see that
crazy Tech Texas movie and I&#39;ll go out
and see frozen again right or maybe what
you say is we&#39;ll see your movie this
weekend my movie next week in that case
I suggest seen the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre first and then frozen whatever
you&#39;re doing you&#39;re negotiating you&#39;re
working with somebody to make change
this photograph here is a photograph
that is
from collin college which is north of
dallas a group of students here college
students some of other internationals
and some of their domestic and they&#39;re
involved in something called the welcome
to america flow where they welcome
students to the united states and try to
make them feel comfortable and coming to
the united states during aging and
creating the sense of community so the
final means I want to talk about briefly
is the idea of non-violent civic action
I talked about that previously engaging
with people of differences in a mass way
to make change we are seeing more and
more of that going on today and it
doesn&#39;t have to be it&#39;s obviously
partisan but regardless of what the
partisan divide is you can learn to do
this I recommend gene sharps work to
people were thinking about doing this
this is actually a photograph of my
daughter who&#39;s dealing with a lot of
stress all the time at the Women&#39;s March
in January Martin Luther King in 1963
was arrested in Birmingham Alabama some
of you may remember that and when he was
in the Birmingham jail he wrote a famous
letter letter from Birmingham jail and
he was writing the letter to the local
Protestant clergy in Birmingham and one
of the things he said a letter was
nonviolent direct action seeks to create
such a crisis and foster such attention
that a community that has been
constantly refusing to negotiate is
forced to deal with the issue as the
means so the ends so getting people to
think about engagement by means to
create ends are very important last
photograph Millennials so we&#39;ve been
talking about Millennials this is my
millennial son and we&#39;ve been talking
about what they can do Millennials bring
a lot to the table and they can offer a
lot through their desire to collaborate
and their desire to do the right thing
and we can learn from them and the means
to the ends my son is in Namibia right
now and in another program that&#39;s
important to what we do in some of a
program that many of you probably
familiar with and that&#39;s the Peace Corps
right in trying to do good work
hopefully in our family
created a generation of peace builders
that do tech for work so thank you very
much
[Applause]
