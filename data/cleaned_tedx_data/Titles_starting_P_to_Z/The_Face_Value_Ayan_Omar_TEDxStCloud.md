this is my mother cadra Ali Heather my
mother&#39;s face humbles me it&#39;s also my
reset button her story and her face
reminds me how small I am in times of
trouble as a result I still run to my
mother at almost thirty years old and I
still managed to surprise her with my
foolishness she looks at me and says
really there&#39;s a story in every face
that is often lost and forgotten in
technology I will attempt to remind you
of the value of a person&#39;s face by
sharing with you and call you to
practice more interpersonal
communication interpersonal
communication validates our
interpretation of the world the greatest
Roman order
Marcus Tullis Cicero says the face is a
picture of the mind with the eyes as its
interpreter the focus of for the next 10
to 15 minutes is to energize revamp and
reset your perception on interpersonal
communication I will try to do this by
reminding you of the oldest and purest
form of communication now the tragedy of
our times is that we are given a false
sense of human interaction we all have
facebook maybe we use FaceTime we chat
or snapchat in the advancements of the
technology and the times that we that
we&#39;re currently in
we&#39;re losing the good old tea and
conversation or as I would say it in my
Somali language chef and shekel the
social conformity
is depriving us of human relationships
the simple concept of unfolding and
constructing and building human
relationships or a pure form nonverbal
communication is account for 90% of our
communication but yet we spent so much
time building and using verbal
communication we judge others
non-verbally we look at their the way
they&#39;re dressed the religion that they
practice the color of their skin we
don&#39;t give them a chance to explain or
introduce themselves we use second and
third person narratives when we are
inquiring about our neighbors both
literally and figuratively so the goal
for interpersonal communication is
taking you to ask listen share and
respond I want to explain two ideas that
currently deter our face-to-face
communications the very first one is
technology a 2014 study showed looking
at a hundred friendly individuals
participating in a 10-minute
conversation when their phone was
present they were distracted they
continued to fiddle with their phone but
in the absence of technology their phone
the conversation resulted in greater
empathy that should be a public
announcement conversation resulted in
greater empathy we need empathy so that
we are able to reach out and see human
another study showed when we share a
smile or laugh with someone face to face
we are more compassionate we are more
empathetic
and we also improve our health our
gestures start to mirror one another and
we are able to adopt a new concept of
who we all are so the question becomes a
white what&#39;s in it for me like why is
this important to you well I&#39;m a Muslim
Somali refugee migrated to the United
States November 1993 in the process of
climbing Abraham Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of
needs there&#39;s that level three called
love and belonging and in order for
people like me and my mother to climb
our hierarchy of needs in pursuit of
happiness we need empathy compassion and
understanding now that&#39;s impossible
to adopt that without empathy and
empathy is the product the result of
face-to-face interaction so in order to
achieve to feel love and belonging it is
important that we start to talk to one
another not at one another this brings
me to the next concept then the second
deterrent to face-to-face communication
is a makeup industry in 2016 the makeup
industry reached 17 billion dollars in
sales
it grew 6% now majority of the products
were highlighting contours as well as
other makeup primers we&#39;ve become a mask
Society masked in emotions we are afraid
to sit in front of one another
if you&#39;ve ever said oh I don&#39;t feel like
getting ready you and I have something
in common
however also the makeup industry has
become so normalized they&#39;ve given us
this idea this concept of what beauty
looks like what it means to be fit for
face-to-face communication and it&#39;s no
longer the cover girls are no longer
paid celebrities in an article that was
recently published Digital Surgeons
showed that makeup tutorials on YouTube
and Instagram makeup tutorials account
for 700 million views per month people
are learning how to look beautiful
rather than being beautiful so gone are
the days of Kodak moments I grew up in
the 90s so I have an idea of what that
was all about the corner corners
now the purpose behind behind
understanding that technology and makeup
impact the way we interact with one
another or the lack of interacting with
one another reminds me of my mother my
mother when I was young I vividly
remember her saying libera jeewa haddem
which means to be two-faced as sinful I
took that literally where by taking it
literally and talking to more people
communicating with others face to face
I&#39;ve discovered a new superpower a
superpower that allows me to change
minds and hearts as a result and and
that that superpower is in all of us
the human face allows us to navigate and
manipulate how we are perceived
I no longer we live in a society where a
society of implications everything is
implied nothing is expressed when it
comes to my identity and who I am I
don&#39;t want you to infer I want you to
ask the desire for face to face
interaction is built in every human
being and with that I&#39;ll talk about the
vagus nerve I&#39;m not a scientists or a
psychologist than just a language arts
teacher
but the vagus nerve is connects the mind
to the heart and it wanders throughout
the body it&#39;s also called the love
nerves the more you stimulate your love
nerve the more compassionate you are the
more understanding you are the more love
you are given but the vagus nerve is
important because it projects our
humanity to our face and it also
projects in our voice it is good to
stimulate your vagus nerve because when
you do you are decreasing your chances
of cardiovascular disease you have a
health healthier immune system you have
it you are reducing your level of stress
so not only is chef and shackle
conversation and tea valuable to you and
your health but it is also important to
the entire community
dr. Daschle Keltner from UC Berkeley
said communities that have the most
sympathetic members will flourish and
raise the greatest number of offspring
but how do we stay true to that right
we&#39;ve become fictitious we&#39;ve become
animated everything is superficial we
invest so much in emojis supposedly
these yellow caricatures are supposed to
imply my human emotions
now the smiley face with the
heart-shaped eyes has does no justice to
my face
just doesn&#39;t so it&#39;s very important when
we are using emojis to connote or imply
human emotions that we remember our face
is much more valuable also using emojis
and technology we&#39;ve become so
desensitized there is no digital
technology creative enough to capture
the subtle unspoken words of the human
face the contextual background that I
get from looking at my mother in the in
the face when I&#39;m talking to her or
talking to my friends in person the
contextual background gives me an
appreciation and allows me to built on
my relationship with others but it also
allows me to understand their human
emotions
technology is unequipped and unqualified
to tell the narratives hidden in faces
and what we do is we hide behind a
screen and hiding behind a screen
somehow gives us a permission to be
callous or to avoid I wrote an article
last November for Washington Post on
explaining my faith and I made the
mistake of reading the comments the cut
we live in a world where we&#39;re supposed
to just get over it because it&#39;s just
words but in the absence of a person&#39;s
face or human interaction words can kill
can harm a society it can create
disconnect but it can also create pain
for the individual but also according to
Vinita Mahato she&#39;s a licensed clinical
psychologist she says that there are
three telltale signs that we wear on our
face we wear a grass
sexual orientation and personality as a
result personality is very important as
a young Somali Muslim refugee my
personality is worth getting to know
much rather I offer you my time and you
get to know me than risking the fact
that you may learn it elsewhere but also
the tragedy becomes the tragedy of not
participating in face-to-face
conversation is that we get a single
story and we all know that the dangers
of a single story is often more popular
than the actual so what what now right
I&#39;m standing you&#39;re talking to all of
you and you&#39;re listening to me you are
actually better than my high school
students thank you very much I am
calling you to reset your perspective on
interpersonal communication reevaluate
your belief system listen and validate
when I was young my mother personified
everything she personified the chair the
chair had feelings the table had
feelings the door had feelings my
sisters had feelings everything had fear
but in her personification I learned
that that there&#39;s more to life that not
only people but also our environment is
very valuable wouldn&#39;t it be nice if we
were governed by our mother&#39;s spirit
would would we not see every child as
our own and just as we embarrass
humanity would we not get the look that
would slap the foolishness right out of
us every so often I&#39;ll visit my mother
to indulge in a story her story my
mother once shared a story with me of
how she had to cross the Juba river to
escape the war the civil war in Somalia
she crossed the Juba river with my
brothers anxiously crying on her back
while she led a group of families to
survivor she&#39;ll watch the news and
she&#39;ll say I wish the president would
come over for dinner I&#39;d like to give
him chef and shekel and I&#39;m a little
biased but my mother shat handshake was
better than golfing may we all remember
our mothers our mother in everyday
conversation but lastly it has been
proven that when we communicate
face-to-face we build a language of
community compassion unity understanding
and trust and if you take anything away
from this talk I would like you to
remember people like my mother and I we
don&#39;t want to eat the whole pie we want
to bring Shakti in hopes that we can
engage in a shekel conversation and
somewhere down the road get a taste of
the pie thank you
