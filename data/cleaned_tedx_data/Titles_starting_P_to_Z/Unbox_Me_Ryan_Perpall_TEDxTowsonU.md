there are big questions in life some are
bigger than others that all need to be
asked if you want to live a full and
enlightened life the biggest in my
opinion comes from the writer and
lecturer Joseph Campbell he says the big
question is whether you are going to be
able to say a hearty yes to your
adventure merriam-webster dictionary
defines adventure as a unusual and
exciting typically hazardous experience
or activity it sounds intriguing right
why do we as humans take pause at that
question why do we stray from the yes I
think it&#39;s because we live life in boxes
we self organize and wall ourselves off
by class race gender sexuality
nationality intelligence and 100 other
categories we as humans fear complexity
we fear dynamic identities we fear the
divergent and most of all we fear the
change maker saying rest of your
adventure means taking a full commitment
to unbox yourself the first you have to
ask what is a box and what does it mean
to be boxed I think a box is a physical
and mental way of existence being box is
a consistent agreement - here - are
unwritten and are unexamined rules of a
mediocre engagement with the world and
its people the box looks like the server
at your local diner putting on a wide
fake get out sort of grin it looks like
your 19 year old college student working
in a retail clothing store quietly
cursing out their manager and they&#39;re
ordered to straighten and restock the
store for almost two hours after closing
it looks like the men working in junk
removal who has laughed at in belittled
when he brings up too many esoteric
intellectual questions at a
where your human task is to pick things
up and put them down for 12 hours a day
it feels like your shoulders your chest
and your plane are being weighed down by
the weight of unexplained unequal and
unexamined societal structure this
system of boxes this system boxes every
generation from birth to death but
there&#39;s alternative the opposite of
being box is being unbox unboxing takes
courage and takes a healthy disregard
for the impossible
when a person exercises that humanity to
the fullest extent there&#39;s a natural
compulsion to create cultivate and
connect with extraordinary people and
platforms create we need to bring
something into existence the following
people I&#39;m not to mention they unbox
themselves and dared to create while
facing formidable odds during their time
on earth Garrett Morgan and mented the
traffic light and the industrial gas

created the Super Soaker in his spare
time reaching over 200 million dollars
in sales unboxed 1991 cultivate to
improve by labor and or study these
young people up here have exemplified
the extraordinary results that you can
achieve when a person cultivates the raw
talent and the quiet ambitions that lie
within Yara Shahidi

old actor rapper green entrepreneur and
social activist he also ambassador for

Bel Air I wear blue nail polish rock

Louboutin womenswear unbox me
unboxing does this creativity explodes
having a healthy disregard for the
impossible opens up the possibility for
creation you can do anything in such a
manner to empathy and understanding
explodes when you decide to unbox
yourself to so yes that adventure you
can empathize with almost anyone at
anything Toni Morrison a famous author
is quoted saying one must view the world
through the eye in one&#39;s heart rather
than just trust the eyes and one&#39;s head
when you unbox what is real and what is
true is clarified Maya Angelou a poet
and an author said human beings are more
like than unalike and what is true
anywhere is true everywhere so how does
this work how can i unbox I believe
there are two steps step one find out
what scares you find out what you don&#39;t
understand what frustrates you what
intrigues you and chase it step two is
repeat step one I&#39;ve committed to
unboxing for the rest of my life just
two years into this mindset and I have
started a movement to unbox the glass
industry and the practices surrounding
environmental sustainability
I have doubled down and committed to
building the infrastructure of tomorrow
sustainable society I believe unboxing
reveals and releases the game the game
changers and I believe the true game
changers not only have the power to
think outside the bar outside the box
but also the power to break the box and
turn clear in the space to cultivate the
synergy of talent and hard work I am one
of those true game changers
my name is Ryan Thomas RuPaul and I&#39;m
the founder and the master facilitator I
break box us a wave box
as well glass recycling needs
recreational destruction we&#39;re a glass
recycling partner company that utilizes
a recreational destruction business
model to produce a consistent abundance
of high quality color sorted or covered
container glass that can be used by
glass manufacturers to make new glass
products our mission is to lessen the
factors that contribute to climate
change we do this by recycling glass
containers more regularly and
efficiently according to the EPA and
independent studies 24% of all
greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 that
were released into the atmosphere can be
attributed to industrial manufacturing
this manufacturing sector is
traditionally one of the hardest areas
to make eco-friendly and reduce the
output of greenhouse gas emissions all
the one sub sect of the manufacturing
industry cannot lessen the output of
greenhouse gas emissions without
lowering the quality of their product
that is glass container manufacturing in
other words glass manufacturing is the
only sector of the manufacturing
industry where the output of greenhouse
gas emissions can be reduced while
without lessening the quality of the
glass products being produced this is
done by putting more broken and
recovered glass containers into the
manufacturing process glasses are
infinite material meaning that you can
break it down and melt it and reshape it
and reform it infinite amount of times
we can directly lessen the factors that
contribute to the greenhouse effect and
with severe weather patterns known as
climate change by simply recycling more
glass bottles at break box cooler smash
bottles and save our world and lures to

launching our summer tour at the end of

Park DC and Towson all summer and effort
to better the break box business model
and to achieve our sustainability and
break experience goals we&#39;re starting
out with a mobile unit that some would
describe as a mobile smash shop our goal

cities all over the country in the fall
we&#39;ll bring this break box mobile unit
back to Towson until our storefront
location it will be open for more
information and to stay up to date our
website is www.pevs.com I&#39;ve been
working on break box about a year and a
half now we&#39;re just about at the launch
phase there&#39;s a team about 15 people
working on break blocks every single day
here on campus a lot of people ask me
questions how does Howard Ennis how do
you manage school had a man into life
the main question is who are you to dare
so boldly to build and I think about
this poem that I wrote in my career the
writing class in high school and he goes
like this mirror mirror on the wall who
is the dopest of them all I wake this
beast of this ego I pretend not to keep
I spit in the faces of our apologies
why go whining and son this is just me
know your lines know your spot school a
man all I can be is me every time I need
my eyes I revert these verses smile on
the reflection listening looking at that
beautiful phallic canvas masterpiece
that stood before me gazing at this king
with no sense of Kingdom no sight of the
throne
but nevertheless he was in fact king
nevertheless he was in fact me and the
depth of your being you can hear this
king or queen as they whisper to you
trying to help you find the key to open
the door that traps them there whispers
loudly and frequently so that sooner
rather than later
you two can finally meet this leader you
who has a royalty loyalty and ambition
flowing in our DNA
consistently whispers unbox me unbox me
Warren Bennis put it like this the point
is not to become a leader or King the
point is to become yourself to use
yourself completely all of your skills
gifts and energies in order to make your
vision manifest you must withhold
nothing you mustn&#39;t some become the
person you&#39;ve started out to be and to
endure the process of becoming I think
you can&#39;t teach ambition I think it is
felt and then expressed I encourage
everyone to feel for it find it and
start painting the canvas of your life
so that one day soon you too can share
your masterpiece with the world next
time you hear unbox me from that little
king or queen inside listen act and
thrive thank you
