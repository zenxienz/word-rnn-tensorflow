what is the word privacy mean to you it
turns out the concept of privacy is
actually only a hundred and fifty years
old while the foundations were laid as
early as 1200 AD what you and I think of
as privacy is actually a child of the
Industrial Revolution we don&#39;t think
about our privacy every day nor do we
think about how our own actions affect
our privacy
we might shred our bank statements
before we throw them out or cover the
key powders before we type in our PIN
despite that most of us would
acknowledge that privacy is a
fundamental human right while we might
have privacy in our own home the right
to be alone in many countries privacy is
not explicitly protected by law
especially when it comes to the Internet
and there we&#39;ve seen an aggressive
erosion of our privacy because privacy
is not actually about keeping things
private it&#39;s not about secrets it&#39;s
about choice the choice about what we
tell other people about ourselves and
there is only one business model on the
Internet and that&#39;s advertising
consumers have persistently refused to
pay for software services and content on
the web and that means behind everything
we do on the Internet
online is advertising and behind that is
the data that makes it possible think
for a moment how your life might be
different if google charged a monthly
subscription fee or worse yet perhaps
took a micro payment based approach and
charged you on a search by search basis
our series almost accidental decisions
and circumstances have led us to a place
where the content on the Internet
appears to be free it&#39;s not we pay for
it in different ways our data and our
attain
you know what we used to pay Google for
our searches and Facebook for keeping in
touch with our friends more than a few
years ago now
Mark Zuckerberg famously stated that he
no longer considered privacy to be a
social norm
I think Zuckerberg was right at least at
the time but I also think there&#39;s a
serious privacy backlash coming the era
where privacy can no longer be assumed
where is not a social norm will not long
survive the coming of the Internet of
Things because our devices are already
becoming smarter they&#39;re becoming
Network connected our computing is
diffusing out into our environment
whether we know it or not we leave a
trail of data behind us as we move
through the world data exhaust shreds of
our digital identity if you will and in
10 years time our world will be full of
sensors and they&#39;ll be embedded in
everyday objects things that today might
surprise us but for now for today those
sensors are embedded in our cell phones
in our smartwatches in our fitness
trackers and they don&#39;t just talk to us
they talk to the internet and the data
from these objects almost invariably
ends up in the cloud where it&#39;s
aggregated packaged and then almost
certainly sold that model is forced on
manufacturers because we trained by the
other internet refused to pay for the
services that make these devices smart
we might be willing to pay for an object
a physical thing that we can hold in our
hands but the services that lay behind
them well not so much and that&#39;s
unfortunate because that makes us the
product rather than the customer because
there&#39;s no such thing as the cloud all
there is is other people&#39;s computers
there are a long way away and if we
won&#39;t pay for them then someone else has
to which is a problem because it&#39;s not
just our email or photographs of our
care
it&#39;s our heart rate our respiration rate
our location not just how we slept last
night but with whom suddenly the data
were trading for our free services has
become a lot more personal a few years
ago now I robots the manufacturer of the
adorable robotic vacuum cleaner the
Roomba gave it&#39;s the ability to make a
map of your home and figure out where it
was within it a couple of months ago
they turned around and said that they&#39;re
now going to share those maps with their
commercial partners and yes you did give
them permission to do that you read the
Terms of Service before you collect I
agree right no nor did I it turns out
this sort of data is a bit more
sensitive people aren&#39;t quite as happy
to trade this for free services
especially when those free services come
wrapped up inside Smart Objects that we
paid for with actual money and it&#39;s not
just the data from these objects there&#39;s
a problem metadata the web traffic
between the objects in your home and the
cloud services that are behind them both
can say a lot about your lifestyle and
habits looking at the traffic flow
patterns emerge whether you&#39;re at home
whether you&#39;re asleep the footprints
your objects leave behind them on the
internet tell a story it really comes
down to a matter of ownership we might
have purchased a thing but the software
and services that make that thing smart
remain with the manufacturer the end of
last year John Deere for instance turned
around and told farmers that they didn&#39;t
actually own their own tractors all the
done was purchase a license to the
software that made them go which is a
bit of a problem if you&#39;re trying to fix
a tractor in the middle of a muddy field
or if you want to take it to a
third-party repair shop you have to use
the dealer network which really changes
the
concept of ownership in the run-up to
hurricane
Irma as it bore down in Florida recently
Tesla the electric car company rolled
out an over-the-air software update for
its cheaper models in Florida giving
drivers 30 to 40 miles extra range
helping them to escape the hurricane
normally that extra range range is
locked down in software if you want to
make use of it you have to pay extra
which sort of makes me wonder when is
the first death buy smart thing going to
happen because there are a lot much
smaller emergencies much less publicized
much less notified where an extra 30
miles of range can be the difference
between life and death
I think the first death by smart thing
whether it&#39;s corporate manslaughter or
perhaps personal malice will be prosaic
it&#39;ll be an electrical socket a smart
thermostat a water heater it may well
have already happens because in the rush
to put our things online we&#39;ve been left
with purse security and privacy models
and a business model that almost forces
the manufacturers to abandon the things
before we as customers are done with
them the business model before behind
most smart things in your home is pretty
much the same you&#39;ve made a one-time
purchase of a thing but no actual
commitment to pay a subscription to
support the services that make it smart
unfortunately the fabric of our homes is
far more static than most manufacturers
used to operating on internet time have
come to assume we might be willing to
replace our smart phones every year or
two but not our thermostats or our light
switches which sort of makes this
business model a bit unsustainable which
makes me think that perhaps both us and
the manufacturers will eventually have
to take subscriptions as the way to pay
for smart devices this might be fine for
those devices that require consumables
the razorblade business model where
by subsidized razors and then we pay
through the nose for the razor blades
forever more is well-established but for
those objects where there are no ongoing
costs
traditionally except eventual
replacements this is a bit more sticky
both the manufacturers and ourselves
might have to accept smart devices that
degrade in functionality a smart light
switch for instance that slowly becomes
dumber as we stop paying for it and
eventually becomes just a switch in the
wall where you can turn the light on or
off rather than a smart Internet
connected device after all it&#39;s taken us
30 years to have a constructive debate
around privacy on the internet and it&#39;s
won quite frankly I think we&#39;ve pretty
much lost the Internet of Things however
is still in its infancy and here I still
have some hope because the debate around
privacy there is already well underway
and the problems I&#39;ve talked about have
become public relations nightmares for
the companies involved which is not
something you see with the other
internet very often uber for instance
recently rolled back changes to its app
where it continued to track its riders
even after they&#39;d finished their trip
it&#39;s reversed these changes stating that
the hand properly communicated the added
value of letting them trackers all the
time even when we weren&#39;t using their
app and legislators both here and in the
United States are looking at what are
called so-called right to repair bills
this returns some measure of ownership
to us the consumers the European
Parliament for instance recently called
and manufacturers to try and reduce the
amount of built-in obsolescence in their
products and to make spare parts more
available and more affordable the thing
that makes me give the most hope however
is something called the GDP are the
general data protection regulations this
comes into effect in May next year
throughout the European Union and
despite brexit here in the United
Kingdom
it will fundamentally affect the way we
build smart objects and the business
models behind it it introduces new
rights for our consent
we must consent for our personal
information to be used and our consent
cannot just be assumed also we&#39;re not
allowed to consent if we have no choice
or if we can&#39;t withdraw our consent
later objects also have to be designed
for privacy by default and manufacturers
have to look at the implications of the
data that they do want to collect
so no more shrink-wrap licensees around
our data at least in theory there are
also rights around their ability to be
forgotten the right to be forgotten and
our ability to move our data and
services between devices which is
something that&#39;s been almost impossible
on the other internet those of us
involved in building the Internet of
Things are also staking a trusting to
take notice of the sort of privacy
concerns that all of us including those
of us building it really have personally
I&#39;m involved in a community led effort
to build a consumer facing trust mark
for smart devices so like the wall mark
or the fair trade symbol it&#39;s there to
provide reassurance about the things
you&#39;re buying it&#39;s an effort to go to
Europe beyond the gdpr and look at the
whole lifecycle of a smart device from
design to manufacture to eventual
disposal it&#39;s an effort to make more
ethical design choices because now and
certainly in the future our privacy will
rely on the design choices that people
building these smart devices will make
however community-led efforts like that
and to certain lesser extents the
legislation like the gdpr rely on public
pressure that relies on privacy scandals
becoming public relations nightmares for
those companies and very much we we have
to look at these devices we have to look
at how they&#39;re built the way we approach
them
we&#39;ll determine whether it&#39;s us or the
manufacturers that own them whether it&#39;s
us or the manufacturers that get to use
the data they generate whether we have
any choices about what we tell other
people about ourselves whether there&#39;s
any privacy at all thank you
