well whenever I have any family
gatherings my grandma greets us with the
same greeting my cousins and I she says
me Paula which if you&#39;re Chinese means
you&#39;ve gotten fatter
she makes other observations like your
jackets too tight I don&#39;t really tell
her that the new trend is to have
tighter jackets or that my head is
shaped a little funny and I don&#39;t tell
her that my head shape is actually part
of her genetics but I also make
observations about my grandma&#39;s well she
loves to save money which I do as well
but you know here are some examples my
my grandma she reused his saran wrap
over and over again I&#39;m supposed to be
used once thrown away she also uses
paper towels as actual kitchen towels so
she&#39;ll she&#39;ll dry them out and reuse
them again and most creative of all is
that well actually she actually also has
all her Tupperware is Chinese takeout
that shiri uses in washes but most
creative of all that I&#39;ve seen her do is
she has whenever she runs out a
toothpaste in her toothpaste tube she
cuts open the back of the the two things
I just saw this the last time I was at
home and she scrapes out the rest of the
toothpaste with her with her toothbrush
so she&#39;s really really thrifty and we
all make observations in in one form of
another or another some subconscious
observations and some unconscious
observations I grew up in a non
traditional Chinese family my my father
was a musician and my mom was a
journalist my mom came to America
originally with this dream to be a
journalist and like her father was a
journalist and and she started in the
mail room and eventually she started to
she ended up leading a thousand person
news organization and like most journal
my mom was really really good at making
observations my talk today is on the
power of observation I believe that if
we make more frequent observations and
we observe the right things the role
will be a place with more ideas more
empathy and more joy I have a three part
framework to making observations look
for problems look for beauty and look
for lessons and I&#39;ll just go through
each one so just starting with looking
for problems over the last four years
I&#39;ve worked with over a hundred 50
digital products for different startups
and brands here are some of them and one
of the the attributes that I find most
common among both product owners and
founders is their ability to quickly
identify problems in my own life I keep
notebooks of different problems that
interest me and you you all may have
different problems that interest you all
but my notebook is called business ideas
I&#39;m a business person so I love just
finding problems and then thinking about
how they relate with business idea so
this is actually just an example of one
of my notebooks it&#39;s a this is actual
screenshot from my notebook so it&#39;s just
ideas from you know the end of 2016
until more recent but you can just see
some of the problems that I deal with on
a daily basis one of them being whenever
I got on a flight there&#39;s always a baby
that&#39;s screaming on the flight so I
wrote down create a instrument that
allows baby&#39;s ears to be dealing with
the pressure because that&#39;s part of the
reason why they&#39;re yelling or get rid of
pigeons and outdoor restaurants if you
know you all have probably had
experience where your outdoor enjoying a
nice meal and a pigeon gets dangerously
close to your foot so it&#39;s like outdoor
restaurants need to have some instrument
for dealing with these pigeons and
there&#39;s other more serious things like
how to revolutionize a credit score
which you know is a painful process but
if you all have issues finding problems
I start with this framework I start with
everyday items like something like a
toothbrush and I&#39;ll say toothbrushes
they are there they&#39;re hugely wasteful
of resources you have to constantly
throw them away
and reuse them they you have to floss
and tooth brush your teeth everybody&#39;s
mouth is a little bit different and yet
we all use the similar similar
toothbrush it&#39;s also hard to know when
you&#39;re done brushing your teeth you know
you might brush your teeth for 30
seconds some people brush their teeth
for two minutes but when are you really
done you know toyless is another example
I could go on and on about toilets they
they I mean all of you probably have
experienced something clogging right
everybody&#39;s clogged the toilet before
and had an embarrassing situation maybe
you&#39;re at a neighbor&#39;s house and you
know you had to ask for a plumber they
waste tons and tons of water toilets
haven&#39;t been innovative for a long time
they&#39;re dirty if you&#39;re in a public
toilet you have to touch the the kind of
handle to bring it up and down and there
are sorts of issues that can be solved
but these are just kind of silly
examples I next think about more complex
problems that need to be solved these
are issues that may be a little bit more
nuanced that may not have a direct
answer this could be a question like
what were American voters thinking when
they voted for Trump for example or why
are why does racism still exist today or
why does some neighborhoods or schools
thrive while others don&#39;t so really
thinking through those problems and then
finally I think through the deepest
human problems and that&#39;s you know
problems that we as humans have
struggled with since the beginning of
time what what is the purpose of our
lives
where do we come from what gives us true
happiness and joy many of you probably
heard of William Wilberforce who was one
of the main legislative forces behind
the abolishment of slavery in the UK but
most people probably haven&#39;t heard of
Hannah Moore she was a friend of
Williams and she was a poet a playwright
she was an early advocate for women&#39;s
education and she was abolitionist as
well she she wrote a poem called slavery
which ended up being one of the key
pieces behind legislation and key pieces
that really turned the public tide
towards the opposition of slavery and
one of the questions that
I always ask myself well you even before
that the the slave trade during the time
was kind of one of the most heinous
trades if you think about UK slave
owners would go and and other slave
owners would go to Africa they would
kidnap people that were very healthy
they would put them on these boats and
these boats that would travel from
Africa to the UK about half of the
people would die on those boats so
that&#39;s how about a bad the poor how poor
the conditions were on the boat and then
secondly there were slave owners that
would throw their slaves overboard in an
effort to collect on an insurance claim
so they were treated like property so
this was something that was very clearly
wrong but so few people spoke out
against it so you know my question to
ask is why did she speak up whereas so
others so many others kept silence so
the first thing that I mentioned was
look for problems but it&#39;s not enough to
just look for problems we need to find
something that clashes with our value so
Hanna&#39;s value was that every person is
made in the image of God and therefore
valuable and then she did something
about it and doing something about it is
often the hardest thing because when you
do something that is against public
opinion you often face criticism you
face guilt and shame and sometimes
physical harm as well so you have to be
willing to to do those things so looking
for problems is number one looking for
Beauty number two
we live in this generation and culture
that loves doing easy things I
admittedly after work would love to just
go home sit on the couch and watch
Netflix like you know maybe many of you
it&#39;s it&#39;s always easier to sort of
disconnect if you look at some of the
biggest companies today Google Facebook
Apple and Amazon they deliver things
quickly which is why they&#39;re so valuable
and there&#39;s nothing wrong with
efficiency and productivity and doing
things fast but sometimes it creates an
association that everything should be
fast and easy to get and often the most
beautiful things are complex and they
take time to appreciate an
intentionality working the technology
under industry I see on-demand companies
all the time some of you are familiar
with uber and Airbnb some of the
just on-demand companies but there are
hundreds of on-demand companies I hear
the most random ideas that you wouldn&#39;t
believe that people are coming up with
you know there&#39;s on-demand dog walking
on demand babysitting
on-demand you name it there they have it
so in this generation it&#39;s even more
difficult to take the time to say
complex things are not necessarily
complex but things that are rich and
sometimes take time to process some of
those things are the most beautiful
things an article in the Atlantic came
out more recently that showed that post
iPhone high schoolers are having getting
their licenses later and later and
they&#39;re hanging out with their friends
less and less in person and really
showing that people are using social
media to interact with each other but
they&#39;re not necessarily talking with
each other face-to-face anymore
one of the quotes that I find sums this
up very well is a quote by one of my
favorite pastors and he says raking is
easy but all you get is leaves digging
is hard but you might find gold
beautiful things take effort and time
and I urge you all to kind of look for
watch a critically acclaimed movie even
though if it&#39;s hard to understand watch
it over and over and ask yourself why is
it why is this critically acclaimed read
a long-form book or article that has
stood the test of time I find that some
of the things that have lasted
throughout time those things have
competed against millions of other
things and therefore you know they stood
the test of time and are you know
extremely beautiful or go to a park and
listen to the sounds something as simple
as photosynthesis which many of you know
a plant takes in water and carbon
dioxide and then sunlight and then
produces glucose which is food for
itself and then oxygen which we breathe
in it&#39;s a miracle that&#39;s happening all
around us and we kind of take these
things for granted because because we
just see it all the time and we don&#39;t
think much about it so take the time to
process these things when I was a kid
yeah this to me when I was a kid my dad
used to force me to listen to classical
music he would take us to classical
concerts he would play classical music
in the car and at home and my brother
and I we loved
we love Coldplay and u2 and Radiohead
and some of these you know rock artists
and we hated when my my dad would take
us to these classical concerts but now
growing up I&#39;ve realized that there&#39;s so
much richness in classical masterpieces
you can listen to them over and over
again and they don&#39;t get old whereas a
pop song maybe cliche and you listen to
it 10 times in a day and it gets boring
try listening to a piece of Chopin or
Beethoven turn off the lights and think
about a problem that you&#39;re dealing with
and see how music classical music can
speak to that look for problems look for
beauty and finally look for lessons
lessons you can find anywhere even the
things that people view there to be no
lessons in at all make learning lessons
a game after every class you&#39;re in
figure out what the takeaway is if you
fail at something figure out why you
failed at it and how you can do better
the next time if you see like a business
failing or something like that that&#39;s
why the business failed and try to
figure out the solution yourself when I
was in in high school I really had two
interests sports or basketball and
playing computer games there are so many
lessons I feel like that could be
learned from these two things but most
people at the time it told me stop doing
these things because they take away time
from more valuable activities like doing
your schoolwork or whatever it is but
just to give you an example of some of
the different things I&#39;ve learned this
is me in middle school playing computers
so for computer games obviously I&#39;m a
technologist today there&#39;s no
coincidence that I&#39;m pretty good with
computers and a lot of that has to do
with me playing games frankly I also
managed a team at a very young age and
our team became one of the top five
worketh teams in the United States and I
learned how to be strategic and come up
with counter strategies and then finally
I found shortcuts to things in gaming if
you&#39;re two or three seconds behind
someone then that could cost you a win
or a loss and there have been more
profound lessons that I learned in in
basketball this is me at the Staples
Center which with my Wizards Jersey on
and some of the some of the best lessons
I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve been in basketball so
for example I come from DC and
all the wizards if you&#39;re NBA fan you
know that the Wizards are horrible over
the last 30 years we were this we have
the second worst record cumulatively in
that period of time and so I grew up
really needing to learn the lessons of
faithfulness and patience my pastor said
at my my wedding that he knew that it
would be a faithful husband because I
was a Wizards fan it&#39;s it was painful
growing up it was always a lost over
time a missed call something always went
wrong but it taught me that some of the
my greatest joys came from following
this painful team and learned in having
association with friends secondly
encouragement home court advantage is
one of the most valuable statistics that
our that is used nowadays home court
advantage the same team that plays at
home has a much better chance than the
team that plays away and the main
difference is someone cheering for them
my parents growing up always told me
that I could do anything but I really
set my heart to and worked hard at and
that allowed me to go from really a high
school student that wasn&#39;t really good
at getting good grades to a gamer to a
hedge fund manager to running a
non-profit to now having a technology
company a foundation and a real estate
company Oscar finally one more thing on
sports the it also tells me the value of
adoration is one of those things where
if you&#39;ve gone to sports game the
excitement of scoring a goal or a basket
you see strangers hugging each other and
giving each other high-fives there&#39;s
people from different socioeconomic
classes different races all together
being part of this greater picture and
eyen ran the novelist once said
adoration is one of the greatest human
desires we&#39;d like to be part of this
bigger picture and it&#39;s the same thing
in music when you go to a concert you&#39;re
you&#39;re you&#39;re euphoric because you&#39;re
part of this bigger picture and unified
with other people Oscar Wilde had a
quote that said the public have the
insatiable curiosity to know everything
except for what is worth knowing it
turns out in the information age there&#39;s
lots and lots of information but we
don&#39;t always observe the right things
it&#39;s not always about knowing everything
if you want to make a difference in the
world it&#39;s about knowing the valuable
things and being willing to live and die
for those things my wife and I in 2014
we moved to South Central Los Angeles
which many people know as the home of
the Crips and bloods or to the most
famous gangs in the US and we moved
there because as Christians Jesus spent
time with those that faced in Justices
and that have been marginalized by
society that was a problem that we were
extremely passionate about and we moved
in order to do that a lot of people when
we first moved told us that we were
crazy there was too dangerous that the
people there had came from too big of a
background difference than us but but we
found the opposite to be true we learned
about the problems of systemic racism in
America we learned about the joy and
beauty of long-term community and we
learn lessons from people with a
different perspective than us it&#39;s
estimated today that there are over 30
million slaves and this is a huge
problem there are so many problems today
that need light to be shed on and I&#39;m
just gonna read a poem off the screen
that if you guys can follow it along
that that I mentioned previously that
Hannah had wrote called slavery to close
out by followers only have a face to
shame inscribed by slavery on the
Christian name shall Britain where the
soul of freedom reigns Ford&#39;s changed
for others she herself disdains
forbidded heaven I&#39;ll let the nations
know the Liberty she taste she will
bestow not to herself the glorious gift
confined she spreads the blessing wide
as humankind and scorning narrow views
of time and place bids all be free and
Earth&#39;s extended space what page of
human annals can record a deed so bright
as human rights restored Oh may that
godlike deed that shining page redeem
our fame and consecrate our age use
observation as a tool to shed light on
in darkness find a problem that you&#39;re
passionate about find beauty that can
inspire you to action and learn a lesson
to every circumstance thank you
