let&#39;s take a quick poll who here
regularly checks the news because they
want to be an informed global citizen by
show of hands okay so most people most
of us want to be globally informed
citizens being informed makes you sound
more interesting at dinner parties it
can be seen as a sign of intelligence or
status and frankly who doesn&#39;t want to
connect with their fellow human beings
around the world however how informed
are we really who here feels informed
enough about say Trump&#39;s travel ban to
at least mention it passing lean
conversation okay how about the recent
political turmoil in Gambia the ethnic
cleansing Myanmar the drug war in the
Philippines barely anyone&#39; so obviously
we&#39;re not informed as we think we are
but it&#39;s not our fault the media hasn&#39;t
made it easy for anyone to access
quality international news but how come
in the modern age when the sharing of
information is supposed to be at its
height getting quality news is harder to
do than it was in the 1950s according to
Professor Jeffrey Cohen in the 1950s
there were three main channels one got
their news from ABC CBS and NBC each of
these channels delivered the same news
every night so whether you liked it or
not you were watching the news at that
time this set up though certainly not a
utopia was mostly beneficial for all and
developments in the cold and Korean Wars
were able to stay fresh and everyone&#39;s
mind however with the 1980s came the
rise of cable television meaning that
one could watch many things other than
news during primetime
this changes news outlets because now
they have to compete for your attention
how do they do this they provide less
hard news and more filler less
large-scale events and more clickbait in
the 1990s instead of covering
developments in the Belfast agreement or
the collapse of Yugoslavia the news
media found itself preoccupied with
clickbait stories such as the Monica
winds
a scandal and the OJ Simpson trials and
modern day instead of covering an Iraqi
Army&#39;s attack on the isis-held city of
Mosul the news finds itself preoccupied
with the Kardashian&#39;s wedding the graph
above shows data and a paper by
Professor Cohen showing the average
percentage of news deemed hard news over
time as you can see ABC used to have
nearly 72% hard news in its reporting&#39;s
the average has fallen to 48 percent to
less than half NBC has fallen to under
40 percent so what is being covered
instead personal health celebrity crime
crime sports and entertainment also
please keep in mind that little hard
news is outlets are providing most
likely aren&#39;t the most important
headlines but the headline is designed
to make you click for example on a given
half-hour news show wouldn&#39;t receive a
barrage of stories about the latest
superfood a weather forecast a sports
update and for the Outlands little hard
news a story on Donald Trump&#39;s Twitter
feed the outlet may completely neglect a
pertinent story as what happened in
December of last year I don&#39;t know if
men even realized but Gambia&#39;s president
of 22 years refused to step down from
public office after he lost his first
presidential election last December it
was looking like it would escalate into
a West African military conflict we
weren&#39;t hearing about this because the
news is instead reporting on a theory
that Russia had hacked to the u.s.
presidential election and whether or not
that story is true that&#39;s a pretty click
baby story the rise of the Internet also
means that anyone can become a
journalist meaning that many as people
you get your news from haven&#39;t taken a
single course in journalistic ethics
this can lead to the rise of fake news
and some questionable news stories
coming out of seemingly no respected
outlets such as what many people will
know is the BuzzFeed dossier
when BuzzFeed news of relatively
respected news outlet among young people
such as myself published a completely
unverified dossier alleging that Trump
had certain inappropriate ties to Russia
algorithms used by Facebook and will
only work to spread these stories around
further
keep the real news hidden under lines of
code so I always went into this crazy
world with internet and cable television
but as I got into high school I decided
I really wanted to know what was going
on in the world around me you have to
understand I made this commitment in the
thick of the 2016 presidential election
the media was more preocupen to the fact
that Eric Trump foot lemonade in a water
cup than the siege of Aleppo but I felt
that if I tried hard and if I could do
it so the first thing I did was I turned
on NPR I thought that this has to work
if I listen to him often enough but I
found that I was hearing only one side
of every story if I heard every story at
all which leads me to my first point in
order to be a globally informed citizen
you have to read from a wide variety of
news outlets that&#39;s right
you have to read a half-hour news show
likely is not going to provide you with
sufficient information if you want to
hear about international news most
outlets have it it&#39;s just not in their
home page there are many jumping-off
points for which you can get your news
many us-based ones such as seen in an
APC also international ones such as BBC
and al-jazeera
so if we tried this strategy of reading
from many news outlets together right
now for example I&#39;m on NPR&#39;s website but
I won&#39;t be listening like I used to I&#39;m
going to be browsing so I&#39;m going to go
to this news icon world and we&#39;re gonna
see what&#39;s going on in Asia recently ok
so obviously this is a controversial
priest I&#39;m not sure exactly why they&#39;re
calling him a bigot it doesn&#39;t really
say but I&#39;m going to look on CNN right
now so it looks like according to this
this priest has been elected to run
India&#39;s province and he has a Hindu
nationalist
and just stepping back nationalism has
been rising in Europe and North America
and it looks like it has now been rising
in Asia
additionally so that took about 30
seconds now it&#39;s probably more satiating
than an average half hour news show and
this is honestly what reading the news
should be it shouldn&#39;t be listening to
someone else tell you what&#39;s going on
like a zombie it should be searching for
the correct information over many
sources it&#39;s just as if you&#39;re trying to
eat a healthier diet one thing on
survive off of kale alone the same way
one could not survive off of Fox News
alone one couldn&#39;t survive off of CNN
alone the same way one cannot survive
off of peanut butter alone I realized
that
this is hard to do as many news outlets
try to convince you that certain types
of people use certain news sources and
they never look at both however this is
simply a ploy to increase customer
loyalty regardless and healthy diet it
is always important to treat yourself
political satire is actually a great way
to become informed on the news as it is
a great jumping-off point to see what
the big headlines are and yeah tends to
make fun of both ends of the political
spectrum meaning that you can remain
skeptical of both political extremes in
addition if you google any inside jokes
that you don&#39;t get it only makes you
more informed regardless and a healthy
diet there are some things that you
should never ever ever ever eat such as
trans fats and rat poison Facebook news
feeds and fake news so we&#39;ve all heard
about the rise of fake news and the
cause is seemingly related so humans are
not choosing what goes in your Facebook
newsfeed algorithms are and those
algorithms are not looking for stories
that are particularly valid but those
are the most likes comments and shares
so essentially it&#39;s a breeding ground
for clickbait now even if you never
looked at Facebook news again you&#39;d
still probably run into some fake news
stories so you can use some strategies
such as if it uses sensational language
excessive all caps excessive punctuation
you can check the source to see if it&#39;s
well known or not so if you try this
together again so we&#39;re gonna have some
baby steps and so obviously shocking is
in all caps that&#39;s pretty kind of trying
to really when it&#39;s published by etf
news a quick google search reveals the
first four websites are about that site
being fake news team thang news so yes
we need a healthy diet of news we also
need to make sure that this news is on
both ends of the political spectrum now
not saying that we all run over to
Drudge Report or BuzzFeed and have those
be our two sources of news because that
would be a really sad world
however just be conscious regardless of
your political spectrum if you&#39;re just
in the car listening to NPR for an hour
maybe it&#39;s safe to turn on Fox if you
were just listening to Fox the past
three days maybe you can
switch back to NBC this is especially
pertinent to do if there&#39;s a news story
out there that makes you feel mad or
scared and now my men are scared I don&#39;t
mean sad for suffering people
that&#39;s human empathy and frankly that&#39;s
an amazing outcome of watching the news
however if you feel so mad that you want
to punch a politician or so scared that
you think the world is gonna end
then you&#39;re most likely doing a more
extreme news outlet and maybe switching
to a less extreme one will help maybe
the wording much they report the event
will calm you down one example of this I
punched into two very different news
sites Westminster attacker and these are
the two main headlines regarding this
attacker and so depending on your
education how you were raised in your
background one of these headlines may
alarm you a lot more than the other
another good example of this would be if
you&#39;re watching Fox News during Obama&#39;s
inauguration in 2008 Obama was a
Democrat Fox News has a conservatives
hilt so naturally they&#39;d be listing all
these awful things on Obama&#39;s agenda
however if you switch to say NBC for a
while you might feel less angry about
all these awful things in Obamas agenda
and more happy that our country had made
such tremendous progress in electing its
first african-american president if you
must look at commentary then so be it
but I highly recommend it being
bipartisan one of the sights I like to
get my commentary from is another form
of political satire in the form of
editorial cartoons and this site the
Association of American editorial
cartoonists published every cartoon made
that day regardless of its political
spectrum and it&#39;s really interesting
because you&#39;ll see recent stories such
as the recent allegations that Obama
wiretapped Trump&#39;s phone and you&#39;re
gonna see views from the left saying
that Trump is crazy and view sin right
saying that Obama is guilty as charged
and it&#39;s really interesting to look at
because I started my journey to become
one from from the news trying to connect
people internationally but I had
neglected to connect with people on my
own block who had different views than
me and it was an extremely
whirring experience because just because
someone has a different political view
than you it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not
human some of my favorite stories to ask
my elders are where they were when
certain big historical events happened
and they know the big-ticket events well
I&#39;m always surprised by how much more
international events they know for
example my grandma a nose in the
paperboy told her that Hitler had
invaded Poland in 1939 my neighbor
remembers nearly every battle of the
Vietnam War when I asked my grandpa what
people thought about Ronald Reagan he
remembers what people both liked and
didn&#39;t like about him and so I&#39;d like to
leave you with a final request when your
grandchildren asked you where you were
when the Syrian civil war came to a
close know the answer when your children
ask you where you were when the British
left the European Union know people both
liked and didn&#39;t like about brexit and
most importantly when people ask you how
you&#39;re able to remember so many events
remember how you did it thank you
