I was born totally cross-eyed I like to
think that being born with this
condition which is called strabismus
made me a particularly introspective
person always kind of looking inward at
myself this picture is from after the
corrective surgery I had as a baby that
as you can see is only half corrective
as a kid I was pretty sensitive about my
strabismus the kids in my class couldn&#39;t
always tell exactly where I was looking
in the room which in retrospect I should
have just embraced as a cool like
superhero type power stir business girl
you never know where she&#39;s looking I
grew up in the analog era many years pre
Facebook and Instagram and Twitter and
I&#39;m really glad for that because my
parents didn&#39;t have an opportunity to
post this picture of me online
eleven-year-old me let me tell you would
not have been happy about that but times
have changed
today many kids don&#39;t really have a say
in the creation of their own online
identities they have the adults in their
lives creating those identities for them
often from the very day they&#39;re born
those identities are shaped and formed
by others which makes me pause to wonder
are they okay with that are we okay with
that my guess is that most people in
this room have at some point in time
posted a picture or content about a
child
online without necessarily asking
permission maybe we didn&#39;t even think to
ask didn&#39;t even cross our minds maybe in
hindsight we regret that we did it maybe
the kids in our lives really wish that
we hadn&#39;t but this really just brings up
a bigger question about how we engage
young people in meaning
always in decision-making that affects
their lives so I spent almost 10 years
living 230 miles above the Arctic Circle
in Norway while I was there I fell in
love with a treaty this particular
treaty is the world&#39;s most ratified
treaty it&#39;s called the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the child or
the UN CRC for short or the CRC for even
shorter and I fell in love with the UN
CRC while I was working as Regional
Director with Save the Children one of
the world&#39;s leading children&#39;s rights
organizations I was fortunate during my
eight years with this organization to
witness the incredible impact this
document has on children all over the
world the UN CRC was adopted by the
United Nations in November of 1989 it&#39;s
made up of 54 articles that outline the
rights that children have regardless of
where they live in the world their
ethnicity and race their gender their
religion their language their abilities
or any other status and it also
identifies how governments should be
held responsible to make sure that these
rights are upheld of these 54 articles
there&#39;s one in particular that has
guided me in my work as a child advocate
article 12 states the children have the
right to voice their opinions and be
heard in all matters concerning them and
for adults to take those opinions
seriously
so in Norway you can see article 12 at
work in myriad ways there is a daily
children&#39;s news program nationally
syndicated that shares the news of the
world in a child-friendly manner there
are question and answer sessions for
young people and politicians where young
people can ask politicians the questions
that they feel they have a burning need
to have answered and more importantly so
the politicians can listen to what&#39;s
important to those kids
in 1981 Norway founded a children&#39;s
Ombudsperson position a public official
whose sole duty is to make sure that the
laws and rights affecting children&#39;s
interests are upheld and that Norwegian
authorities follow the obligations
outlined in the UN CRC some years ago I
was at a conference for children&#39;s
rights advocates and a city planner
presented a really interesting project
that she&#39;d worked on together with
architects they were working on a
building project in a part of town and
they decided that they wanted input from
the local kids so they invited the
children and to do a mapping project
they gave them pens and paper and they
said show us what this area is for you
and at the end of it what they found out
was really interesting these young
people identified places on the map that
were not on any official map whatsoever
but were on the map that they created
there was a trail from an apartment
complex kind of through a wooded area to
the school it was a shortcut there was a
hill that although not on any official
map was there and the kids used it as a
sledding hill and then there was a sort
of open area adjacent to the school that
was used after school and in the summer
for soccer practice and so the city
planners and the architects decided to
adjust their building plans ever so
slightly so as to keep those areas
intact to put this in context article 42
in the UN CRC says that children have
the right to know their rights so you
can walk in to pretty much any classroom
in mmm Elementary School in Norway third
grade for example and you can say tell
me about your rights and the hands will
go in the air and they will say we have
the right to education we have the right
to health care if we get sick we have
the right to shelter we have the right
to a name and an identity and then as
always happens someone will say we have
the right to candy and then everybody
will laugh so Norway has not only
ratified the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Child but they&#39;ve
taken it a step further and they&#39;ve
incorporated into Norwegian law which is
something very few countries have done
having this particular children&#39;s rights
lens gives Norwegian children unique
insights on empathy responsibility and
global solidarity as mentioned this is
the world&#39;s most ratified treaty all
United Nations member states have
ratified it except for one the u.s. I
visited the ninth grade classroom of a
friend of mine at the high school that I
attended in Duluth Minnesota she invited
me in to talk to her very welcoming and
bright ninth graders and I just stood in
from the classroom and asked what do you
know about children&#39;s rights the UN CRC
blank stares
no hands in the air and then something
happened that often happens when you
talk to kids about children&#39;s rights the
room it&#39;s electrified with energy let&#39;s
harness that energy because the u.s. is
not just our government it&#39;s all of us
and we don&#39;t have to wait for the UN CRC
to get ratified on a national level we
can do our part locally we could do it
in our towns and cities we can do it in
our schools we can do it in our
businesses and our organizations because
we still have this tendency to think of
young people in terms of their future
value we should invest in them today
because they will be the leaders of
tomorrow we hear that a lot but they&#39;re
leading right now there&#39;s leading today
the question is are we listening they
are for example doing leading name
change school name change campaigns in
the city of Minneapolis
they are designing TEDx youth events in
Brookings they&#39;re spending school nights
every week of the academic year learning
about community leadership in st. Paul
they&#39;re doing all of this together with
young people I want to start a movement
to ratify article 12 in our local
communities we start small we start
locally as I&#39;ve grown older I decided
just to embrace my strabismus
it&#39;s really
just Who I am in the same exact way that
Norway has embraced this children&#39;s
rights framework we need to follow suit
here in the United States we need to
move from this just being an idea to
embracing this church help children&#39;s
rights framework and mindset as who we
are here in the United States thank you
