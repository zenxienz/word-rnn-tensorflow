let&#39;s have a real conversation about
fake it&#39;s possibly the most popular word
in the world right now and fake is
something that we use as a label when we
question somethings authenticity we say
is this real or is this true or is this
genuine what we&#39;re actually asking is
does something have value now I am a
professor of art and design and in my
world I know fakes
because in art and in particular images
there&#39;s a long history of fake like
digitally manipulated images that we are
all all too familiar with these days or
older images like this one of us Civil
War General Ulysses Grant which is a
photo they&#39;ve actually made by hand of
several different images in the 19th
century now these fakes sometimes also
are overtly about political control like
when Stalin erased
Nicola Yaga from history after he
accused him of treason and had him
killed
now Vienna is also an excellent place to
talk about fakes because just down the
road there is a Museum of Art fakes
which looks at the history of
counterfeits and forgeries when we talk
about fake in this context it&#39;s about
deception right the fakir is passing
something along to someone and there&#39;s a
value imbalance and that is bad but fake
has utility there actually is a positive
side to fakes especially in the creative
fields for 600 years artists have made
simulations like perspective and depth
illusions these illusions use math and
geometry and optics
to create simulated realities or
approximating vision and this is more
sophisticated these days thanks to
virtual reality and computation
mastering fakery has been a defining
feature for centuries for the creative
arts whether it&#39;s you&#39;re making images
or objects or telling stories so I make
a distinction between good fake and bad
fake good fakes are okay because in part
we are consenting to this inauthentic
experience
it&#39;s like a magic trick you say show me
the trick trick me and suppose we&#39;re all
consenting we actually kind of enjoy
this deception so it&#39;s a good fake but
fake has changed a lot since the 1990s
the Information Age has brought us new
challenges and to the edge of something
else when we call something fake and I
call this hashtag fake it&#39;s a basically
a shorthand for fake in the post
Internet age and it denotes how complex
fakes have become since we become a
global and interconnected sharing
community
fueled by digital tools an hashtag fake
like fake can be bad when the president
of the United States uses hashtag fake
he is weaponizing the word because what
he does is he directs people towards his
truth hashtag fake for him is anything
he doesn&#39;t like or makes him look bad he
is basically dismissing something as
unauthorized and hashtag fake is also
fabrications lies that confirm bias or
rally support or cause confusion and
hashtag fake is also conspiracy theories
as in this case in which a very real
person used very real bullets and a very
real gun and shot up a real restaurant
because he believed in the hashtag pizza
gate conspiracy saying that Hillary
Clinton was keeping child sex slaves in
the basement of this restaurant and it
became very complicated after that
because people said well this is a
conspiracy theory because he&#39;s a crisis
actor someone who is hired to stage this
event so a real event inspired by
hashtag fake news was dismissed as
hashtag fake news by other conspiracy
theorists and so it seems the hashtag
fake is more dangerous than fake but
instead of because instead of deception
it&#39;s about manipulation and control but
like fake there is utility to mastering
an understanding hashtag fake there&#39;s a
positive side to hashtag fake and for
more on that let me show you my nice
watch right but it&#39;s not an Apple watch
even though it looks just like one it&#39;s
a fully functioning Smart Watch but it&#39;s
not made by Apple it&#39;s one of the many
things that I have gone
I&#39;ve purchased in my trips to Shenzhen
China now
Shenzhen a village of 20,000 fishermen
in 1979 is now in my opinion the most
important city in the world over 12
million people live where 90% of the
electronics in the world are made if you
own a TV or a smartphone or a computer
or anything that has batteries or plugs
into a wall
you are part of Shenzhen it also happens
to be an excellent place to talk about
the new fake I buy a lot of headphones
when I go to Shenzhen and it&#39;s crazy
because none of these are apple
headphones some of them are made by the
same factories but don&#39;t pass quality
control and are sold out the back door
as kind of discounted knockoffs
some of them are other companies trying
to make things with lower quality parts
to make it seem like Apple headphones
and some of them are just kind of
designed to be like them even though
when you look closely you realize
they&#39;re slightly different I also buy
fake iPhones and it&#39;s hard to tell by
this image but they&#39;re actually of
different build qualities and when you
go to a merchant that will tell you this
is an a-level fake a b-level sake a
c-level fake and have different prices
accordingly and some of them don&#39;t even
try that hard because while these phones
use Android butts are skinned to look
like Apple iOS I have this phone and
this is the scale where they don&#39;t even
try to hide the OS problem and they said
well we have all these screens sitting
around so let&#39;s just make the Apple
iPhone fit our screen size even though
it doesn&#39;t really match a screen size
that that a real Apple iPhone would have
that&#39;s fine but this can yield some
curious results when things aren&#39;t quite
high fidelity so my Apple watch this
nice one here cost me 15 euros and it
has all the functionality of a regular
Apple watch but I also have one that
cost me half as much and that&#39;s this one
here
for for eight euros you can tell they&#39;re
not trying very hard to make it look
like an Apple watch however it actually
has better functionality because it has
a camera it also has a microphone and a
SIM card which means I don&#39;t have to
pair this 8 year a while
but I can still make live video calls
because it has its own phone number or
this phone which I got the what does it
call the mediacom phone
pad 550 okay it has all the features you
expect from a smart phone and it&#39;s it&#39;s
large it&#39;s about the size of an iPhone 7
plus but it also has features you don&#39;t
have to SIM card slots which means you
can put in two different phone numbers
from when you&#39;re traveling
internationally useful here in the EU it
also has the micro SD slot so you can
expand the available storage of your
phone and you can replace the battery
which you cannot do in an iPhone
essentially Shenzhen&#39;s fakes create a
massive open source project people are
sharing the innovations that companies
are making to this large group of tech
people who are then improving upon the
original idea Western companies don&#39;t
operate under this procedure because
there&#39;s too much money involved in
protecting intellectual property in
creeping copyrights but the people who
are taking these things apart and making
new versions are the next step of
innovation they&#39;re making things faster
cheaper and better and this is the
utility of hashtag fake
it&#39;s a contextualization of something
that we call fake you can call my phone
a bad fake because you don&#39;t understand
the context under which this fake has
value you&#39;re just missing it as
something out that&#39;s valueless even
though the value of this copied
technology leads to better authentic
products that you eventually will own so
good hashtag fake is context awareness
bad hashtag fake is manipulation so
let&#39;s look at more about Shenzhen in
China Jen there&#39;s a neighborhood called
the dolphin oil painting village one of
my favorite places in all the world in
his community of 3,500 artists who
produce by hand oil paintings they work
in small studio spaces set up in the
alleyways of Dauphin and they are making
oil paints to order so you can go to one
of the galleries there and buy in bulk
original oil painted
paintings on canvas and you stretch them
frame them and you&#39;ve got yourself
paintings it&#39;s it&#39;s quite a nice little
place to shop but the Western media
would call this fakes this is a factory
of fakes but of course no one assumes
that these are authentic van Gogh&#39;s they
are made to order you say hey I&#39;d like a
van Gogh painted by someone ok we&#39;ll
we&#39;ll paint you one and send it to you
there&#39;s no deception here so what are
they
it&#39;s easy to dismiss all of this as kind
of industrialized bad fakes
that&#39;s inauthentic and ballast all these
artists are just kind of copying art
that has to be bad but isn&#39;t that what
we do when we&#39;re artists I know that
many of my students copy and work off of
work by other masters to kind of learn
the technique and how is that really
different in Shenzhen but I would argue
it&#39;s even better because while my
students go into debt learning how to
make their art Dafa and painters are
monetizing their practice they are being
paid to make copies which works on their
practice of their of their work however
this is not a romantic
I&#39;m not romanticizing Duffin and the
workers there defend themselves say that
because this is the Dauphin Art Museum
where they only show work by defend
painters and that work has to be
original work so just like western
studio painters they are looking at the
world around them and using their skills
that they&#39;ve monetized through
practicing and making copies into making
original art and all around Duffin you
will find galleries that they call
non-formula art this is their code to
say this is original artwork by dolphin
artists these aren&#39;t copies or
systematized work you can almost imagine
oh well this is actually less like a
factory and more like the Parisian
experience of an impressionist painter
thinking about how to make original work
in the world which by the way if you&#39;re
in Shenzhen you can also go to Paris if
you&#39;d like
or New York how about Egypt so this is
on the other side of Schengen window of
the world which is a theme park with
replicas of World sites and in the
middle of it is this one-third scale
Eiffel Tower and it looms over
everything so you can kind of see it
from everywhere which can create some
very strange neighbors so if you happen
to be in
Shenzhen&#39;s window of the world you can
basically do all of Europe in a day or
if you&#39;re like me you may be lucky
enough to do the fake Europe&#39;s and the
real Europe&#39;s all at once so this seems
bizarre
where you have all these things
colliding together but imagine a region
in southern China unfamiliar with world
cultures according to them they actually
state that the window of the world aims
at achieving I&#39;m documenting the
achievements of human civilization and
the promotion of world culture
Windell the world was open in 1993 at a
time when a lot of Chinese nationals
especially in this part of China were
not exposed to global culture this was a
way to open up the world and to signify
that Shenzhen is a future global city
and if you think this is bad I will
point you to Las Vegas which will give
you another Eiffel Tower as a way to
convince you to lose all your money to
casinos so we diminished theme parks and
art enterprises and technological
innovation because fake as fake because
we see them through our eyes
none of these so-called bad fakes are
deceptive and yet they require an
understanding of a culture that is not
our own to realize their utility they
are positive when you reappraise your
own value system to understand where
they&#39;re coming from are you confused yet
I can imagine you are and that&#39;s okay
because the confusion here in this case
is good the last decade of instant
global sharing has made for a sudden
collision of world cultures and it&#39;s
okay we&#39;re adjusting because it&#39;s it&#39;s
understandable that you would look at
something that you don&#39;t understand and
just dismiss it as fake so I want to
show you my favorite piece of art that I
own sit right here
this is a hand-painted handcrafted
porcelain sunflower seed made in
jingdezhen which is the porcelain
capital of China
it comes from artist Ai Weiwei&#39;s
sunflower seeds which is a 2010
installation in the Tate Modern in
London where he commissioned the
jingdezhen porcelain makers to make 100
million sunflower seeds and lay them
along the the base of the turbine Hall
but I never saw this show I did not take
these from Iowa Way show I bought mine
on eBay and you&#39;re saying wait wait so
it&#39;s a bad fake because you think you&#39;re
buying AI weiwei art but you&#39;re
that&#39;s a no none of these say that they
were in the show and they&#39;re priced
inexpensively because what you&#39;re doing
is you&#39;re subs are supporting this this
entire industry that grew up out of Iowa
way show essentially I&#39;m seeing value in
this beautiful object and it is actually
really beautiful and it&#39;s handmade
and it&#39;s from a place that has
authenticity as a place of original
porcelain work made in China it&#39;s good
hashtag fake I essentially am assigning
it a value because I understand its rich
context so how do we navigate good fake
and bad fake the good hashtag fake and
the bad hashtag fake so here are three
guidelines first when confronted with a
fake do you give consent if the answer
is yes then that&#39;s wonderful enjoy it
it&#39;s a magic trick or a virtual reality
experience or reading satire you&#39;re
consenting it to it so you&#39;re not being
cheated you are in on it so that&#39;s good
second beware the weaponized fake it&#39;s
someone telling you hey that&#39;s fake if
they&#39;re manipulating you then it might
be because you&#39;re talking to the
President of the United States
but seriously beware the minute the use
of fakes as manipulation the bad hashtag
fake and assume there&#39;s a context for
every fake many times there is
authenticity in the thing you were
calling fake just maybe not from where
you&#39;re sitting if you if you call
something a bad fake that you&#39;re
devaluing it&#39;s revealing an ignorance
and a limited way of thinking so finding
contextual value may give you an insight
into authenticity that you didn&#39;t know
about now I have a lot of faith that we
will all eventually adjust to the new
world of hashtag fake this new frontier
we can defuse the manipulative weapon of
bad hashtag fake with empathy and
willingness to contextualize our
experiences and this is the only way
that we&#39;re going to inoculate us to mass
manipulation now it&#39;s tough these days I
get it but soon enough I feel we will
all have enough understanding enough
global exposure
to destroy once and for all the very
worst of hashtag fake thank you
[Applause]
you
