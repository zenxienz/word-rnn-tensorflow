you
hi let me ask you a couple of questions
who loves the Internet show some hands
technology is fantastic who has ever
played a digital game or maybe on your
iPad or something like that and who has
ever experienced virtual reality now
still a couple of hands that are still
there isn&#39;t technology amazing looking
at technology let&#39;s take a look at cos
so this is how car look like in the 50s
some people probably loved the old-timer
in it and this is how a car looks like
today they can drive autonomously they
can see accidents before they even
happen and they move to cleaner energy
sources when they come I have always
been fascinated by technology and by the
possibilities of it in all the years I
have worked with emerging technologies
I&#39;ve seen it move faster and become more
affordable all the time I love
technology I love the possibilities of
it and I love to see how we can improve
a world using technology but for me it
feels strange to see that in some areas
technology is adopted very fast but in
other areas this does not happen at all
take a look at this classroom the
classroom somewhere about the 50s and
this is how a classroom looks like today
it&#39;s almost identical than 50 60 years
ago and of course we have
small BOTS and we have digital books and
we track student progress digitally but
still it&#39;s almost the same way of
teaching like decades ago so why do we
use technology to improve our cars but
why don&#39;t we fully utilize the
technological capabilities to actually
improve our teaching and yes there is a
difference between cars and humans don&#39;t
misunderstand cars can be programmed to
be safe and smart and efficient humans
learn by experience this is an old
wisdom a very old wisdom we learn by
experience by doing it ourselves just
like a child learns how to ride a
bicycle it falls off and then get back
up put down on the bike again for
another try but there is a drawback to
learning by experience who is ever used
to hammer and nails to build something
show some hands almost everyone did it
hurt when you hit your finger for the
first time yes it did and you might
still remember that event thinking of it
and me talking about it now you might
still recall the feeling so I guess that
using a hammer and nails was an
efficient learning strategy offer a few
hurtful moments but what if you&#39;re
working and training environment looks
like this in my daily life I work with
large companies in which complex tasks
need to be trained all the time would
you be training something like this
so sorry today would be the first to try
in real life or maybe this bump into
stuff learning by experience is the only
effective way but we cannot let our
staff step into an explosion or bump
into stuff or experience other danger
when it comes to the most important
tasks for which we really need to be
prepared we are forced to fall back to
less effective ways of learning we have
manuals and instructions and we have
long safety procedures but still we
cannot always practice it for real in
fact 230,000 workers get injured every
year at the workplace in the Netherlands
actually 80 of them die during this
event
so there&#39;s no way we can teach our
workers to be prepared for the
worst-case scenarios by letting them
experience it and me standing here I&#39;m
actually wondering is that so why don&#39;t
we use technology to optimize our
learning the world out there today is
full of new innovative technology such
as virtual reality or augmented reality
which we have seen in your booklet or
maybe even mixed reality as they call it
so it&#39;s available technology right now
in fact this is what I do for a living
I applied techniques that come from
commercial games to involve the learner
we build games sometimes with VR that
actually let people learn by experience
and most recently we have taken this to
the max for some people their work
environment looks like this we are
currently building a VR environment for
training astronauts how to operate this
device and actually how to be safe
learning by doing but without the risk
and without in need of having a mentor
or instructor or master on your site
it&#39;s cost efficient and safe using VR
and you might think does it really work
is it realistic enough in various tests
it has been proven that the use of
especially virtual reality can be
extremely effective when it comes to
learning by experience let&#39;s take a look
at this video
she is now standing over a Ledge about a
hundred and fifty meters above the
ground watch her boss here to jump off
the ledge so we fast forwarded the video
because I took her really a while before
she actually took the leap for her doing
this it&#39;s so realistic that you can see
at her posture how she reacts within
these glasses and eventually feature
so why are we so enthusiastic about
technology when it comes to the internet
or playing games or me maybe even your
own car but why are we so held back and
don&#39;t trust technology when it comes to
teaching and improving our learning even
when games are more effective cost
efficient and safe to all trainers
instructors teachers everyone involved
in learning I would say stop looking at
what we cannot train in real life but
start using the latest innovations
let&#39;s take training and education to the
21st century
let&#39;s get unreal and learn by experience
using VR and serious games thank you
[Applause]
