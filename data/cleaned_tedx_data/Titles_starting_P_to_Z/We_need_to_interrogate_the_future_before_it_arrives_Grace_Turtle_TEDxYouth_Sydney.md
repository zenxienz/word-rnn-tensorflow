okay so the future exciting
what will your future look like have you
thought about it recently my future is
gonna be filled with papaya and coconuts
like what&#39;s up in here you have a moral
obligation to question and interrogate
the futures that have been served to you
and to challenge yourself to think about
alternatives for example imagine it&#39;s
2030 drones a reforesting the Amazon
back to its original state universal
basic income has been set in place and
young girls previously deprived of an
education are in school 2050 NiO tribes
are gathering across the world to have
the United vote on a blockchain to agree
on global resilient strategies the
world&#39;s climate is in recovery power and
wealth has been meaningfully distributed
and the inequity gap is closing
now these futures are obviously
speculative the reality is we don&#39;t know
what&#39;s going to happen in the future
but what we do know is we&#39;re likely to
see more change in the next 15 years
than the past hundred think about that
no wonder we&#39;re anxious about the future
it&#39;s dark but that&#39;s a good thing
because in the darkness lies
possibilities and you have a choice to
idly stand by and watch less ideal to
stop
futures come into play or you can act
and you can play in the darkness now I&#39;m
a design futurist but I don&#39;t believe in
predicting futures I believe in using
experimentation to design alternative
futures that might steer us away from
blindly stumbling towards our ultimate
demise raise your hand if you created
imaginary worlds as a child bingo we&#39;re
all futurists who you believed that
hoverboards would be an actual thing by
now so disappointing I honestly believed
that I would go to Space Camp in space
by the time I left school sad so sad
didn&#39;t happen one of my earliest
memories is wandering into the shed
discovering balsa wood for the first
time rummaging through a blue toolbox
pulling out some random objects which I
took over to my cubby house the original
makerspace to build a contraption with
the hope with the intention that it
would allow me to speak with aliens I
reflect on this memory a lot and I think
it&#39;s because there is a strong
connection between this action and what
I do today is a design futurist not
necessarily speaking with aliens but
using design futuring
and experimentation to help my clients
like government think critically about
the future with the intention to create
better alternatives than our present day
realities so a few years back when I was
an aspiring tattoo artist living in
Bogota I was introduced to an urban
experiment by antenna smokers who during
his time
hired 420 minds like these guys to
re-educate road users about safety by
ridiculing jaywalkers these minds were
able to affect behaviour change that&#39;s
amazing right
recently I used virtual reality to
immerse citizens into a fictional future
of reimagine transport systems we used
VR and AR prototypes and tabletop games
as tools to test concepts around green
corridors safe cycleways electric bikes
autonomous buses and drones citizens
engaged in the experiment were able to
tell us things we otherwise wouldn&#39;t
know like how to prioritize funding to
these concepts based on their unique
needs and smaller details like how they
felt morally towards uber and how they
simply didn&#39;t like the idea of
carpooling with strangers I was
interested to understand what it would
take to get someone out of their car
adopt public transport and feel safe in
a driverless bus because this future
isn&#39;t too far away by 2040 autonomous
vehicles could make up 75% of our road
vehicles and by 2050 it is likely that
70% of us humans will be living in
cities radical urbanization threatens to
increase the structural inequities of
our cities if we don&#39;t redesign public
infrastructure in the right way this
experiment raised the question about
reversing urbanization to create more
equitable cities and if we&#39;re to create
more equitable cities we need to
re-engage the social fabric of our
cities on a cultural level and we need
to decentralize cultural and economic
activity because if we don&#39;t we might
find ourselves in a future with a
privilege travel freely in the sky in
drones while the rest of us plebs around
the ground stuck in traffic where will
you be
up there or down here mobility is a
right and public transport must work for
everyone so today the scale and purpose
of my experimentation is somewhat
different to that of when I was
attempting to contact aliens but the
intention to test an experiment with
futures before they arrived is
essentially the same we live in a time
were generally speaking we&#39;re
disillusioned with the state of the
world capitalism and are failing
democracies we&#39;re threatened by
technological disruptions and most
importantly each other and for that
reason the need for childlike wonder
experimentation and play to reimagine
future worlds is more important than
ever the fifth element and the matrix
were my favorite films growing up big
surprise I believed that one day I would
go to space and fall in love with a
Supreme Being
after being unplugged from a fake
reality where Humanity sleeps oblivious
to the fact that they&#39;re plugged into a
system to power robots this is the
perfect example of a future that we want
to avoid
maybe not the supreme beings
I&#39;m all for supreme beings now don&#39;t get
me wrong I love the future so much
actually have a tattooed on my arm in
future oh I&#39;ve also made it my life&#39;s
goal to facilitate experimentation of
possible futures so that we might avoid
dystopic futures
imagine a future where humanity is no
longer the dominant intelligence in the
world and your choices are dictated by a
set of external algorithms I recently
created a game the humanity trade-off
challenge for a future of work lab
designed to help workers interrogate the
role a I would play in their future the
challenge for participants was to
relinquish aspects of their humanity to
AI in order to renew their own human
intention I put the question to them
what aspects of your humanity like
curiosity and logic should be enhanced
or replaced by AI the first time they
played they&#39;re reluctant to relinquish
much but after interrogating AI they
felt confident in releasing aspects of
their humanity if it gave way for them
to explore new human qualities gained by
doing so like creativity like curiosity
by 2030 a third of human jobs will be
replaced by AI and experiments like the
humanity trade-off challenge allow us to
interrogate a new human logic based on
our difference an intrinsic value as
living social and connected beans in a
world where we exist side by side AI we
need to redefine what it means to be
human because if we don&#39;t we risk
rendering ourselves obsolete all
collectively plugging into power robots
before we are able to read or write we
tink it and we learn through play and
like play experimentation is a universal
language everyone understands and in our
increasingly more complex world
experimentation and play present
themselves as the best tools to
challenge emerging complex futures
authoring the future can&#39;t be top-down
or bottom-up alone it must be a dance
between
both powered by people that transcend
silos and foster a culture of social
production urban activists Jane Jacobs
once said it&#39;s wicked to be a victim and
nobody wants to be a victim of the
future so don&#39;t stand by and let the
future be dictated to you rewrite future
narratives intervene create experiment
play because the future doesn&#39;t have to
be this topic explore the darkness and
take the plunge to steer spaceship earth
away from its impending doom thank you
