all right so a few weeks ago after
eating Chinese delivery I opened my
fortune cookie it said you will live a
very long life my gut reaction was oh Sh
I was diagnosed with bipolar or manic
depression 12 years ago without asking
for my consent my brain enters an into
unbearably long episode of devastating
lifelessness or weeks of extreme
euphoria not only are the episodes
unbearably long for me but both extremes
are confusing and scary for the people
who love me and the people who work with
me I&#39;m very aware that while it might be
my diagnosis the effects of the
condition have an enormous impact on
those around me I&#39;m not the only one who
feels helpless the simplest definition I
can give for both extremes is that
depression means I cannot start and
mania means I cannot stop most people
live their lives somewhere in the middle
or what I refer to as the - and
ultimately the goal of anyone living
with my condition is to exist somewhere
in the middle to live in the - the space
between the two extremes Who am I when I
live in the - at my core I&#39;m a connector
and a creative and I have really big
ideas I have a great sense of humor I
love children and I love dogs I&#39;m a
great writer and communicator I&#39;m a deep
thinker I love to make things with my
hands I am one of those teachers you
want your children to have and I&#39;m
obviously very humble - for close to
three decades I lived the majority of my
life in the - and not in the extremes
Who am I in depression do you remember
those old fashioned jell-o molds where
pieces of fruit
cocktail grapes are trapped in the
gelatin when I&#39;m depressed my brain is
literally stuck in gelatin I cannot
access any part of my creative mind I
cannot connect with people I&#39;m a mobile
brain and body I sleep and I watch hours
and hours of TV
I&#39;ll go days shut in my house with my
shutters drawn and the only thing that
gives me any pleasure is unhealthy food
I can go weeks without showering and
days without brushing my teeth I can go
months without going to a grocery store
I understand wanting to die in a very
profound way depression is humiliating
it&#39;s isolating and it&#39;s lonely about
once or twice a year I visit my manacle
Kingdom something will pop the grape out
of the gelatin with so much force it
will bring me back to life again it&#39;s
like that brilliant Robin Williams movie
awakening when comatose people pop into
life and everything is possible
mania is an explosion of magical ideas
and experiences coming so fast they flow
out of my brain like it&#39;s been trapped
for months because it has been trapped
for months I&#39;m so stoked when it&#39;s
coming I&#39;ll go for three or four days
without sleeping because I feel
invincible
and finally alive I start doing art I&#39;ll
clean and I&#39;ll organize and create I&#39;ll
take walks I&#39;ll write and record all my
magic on a recent magnet on a recent
manic-trip I realized that just because
my brain is moving again doesn&#39;t mean
that people understand what&#39;s coming out
of it in the - world I seem crazy but in
my world it&#39;s anything but it can be
very scary and confusing for the people
who care about me to see me in a manic
episode the most frustrating aspect of
mania for me is knowing that it&#39;s going
to end and instinctively knowing that I
have to be the one to stop it
the ratio of my depression to my mania
is ridiculously unfair probably 12 to 1
for every 12
the depression I get one stunning round
of mania they have something in common
though living in both extremes is lonely
humiliating and exhausting so why am I
actually coming out to all of you after
all sharing my private moments is
humiliating not to mention how hard it
was for me to find something to wear
after seven years of takeout because
it&#39;s real you live with it you might
live with it just like me where you have
a son or a daughter a brother or a
sister relative employee or colleague
who lives with it too and they&#39;re living
with it and so are you and you know and
I know you feel helpless while there is
no magic pill to take it away and I have
tried most there is something powerful
you can do to help yourself and your
loved ones identify your Sherpas Sherpas
are angels on earth that help us climb
up from depression and down from mania
my Sherpas help me do life when I can&#39;t
manage on my own we need help with the
basics of living groceries laundry
errands mail
there&#39;s my Sherpa Cheryl Cheryl is the
type of person who loves walking into a
mess and transforming it she is usually
the first personal text when I feel
myself coming out of a depression my
house is a disaster and I know she will
walk in and help me put it back together
without one morsel of judgment as a way
to maintain my house I have three more
little Sherpas Patti Esther and Vivian
they come every Thursday if my place
looks like an adult lives there it helps
me keep more functional
then there&#39;s my Sherpa Sarah she&#39;s a
yoga therapist who comes to my house
once a week I&#39;m uncomfortable exercising
in front of people right now so doing
yoga and meditation in a private place
is transformative
she will like that next there&#39;s Katie
she&#39;s my hair Sherpa every two weeks I
go to Katy and she washes my hair and
blow the drive this might sound like an
extravagance but it&#39;s one of the things
that helps me feel put together I also
have plenty of Sherpas I don&#39;t pay for I
want to acknowledge my newest Sherpas
the TEDTalk Sherpas Daphna Michael and
Christi so when I applied to become a
TEDx speaker I was either in the - or in
a manic episode but I definitely wasn&#39;t
in a depression but when I found out
that I was going to be a TEDx speaker I
was and I&#39;ve been in a depression in the
past couple months I finally finished
this a couple nights ago and they gave
me permission to bring it on stage so
thank you
sometimes we need to make accommodations
for people it&#39;s really important so some
of my other Sherpas my preschool work
Sherpas holding a job is very
complicated
I offer so much but depending on my
condition I can&#39;t always show up I&#39;ve
been let go from jobs because of because
of manic depression so I&#39;ve learned to
be upfront with employers and co-workers
I&#39;m so grateful to be in a place that
values my gifts enough to work through
my absences and it&#39;s filled with magical
magical children the best medicine for
me my closest friends sisters-in-law
siblings and and cousins are Sherpas -
they&#39;re the ones that keep me connected
they keep calling and texting even if I
don&#39;t answer their perseverance keeps me
tethered they don&#39;t make me wrong for
not answering and they embrace me when
I&#39;m ready to connect
I&#39;ve had many psychiatrist Sherpas many
and it&#39;s okay when they&#39;re not with you
for the entire climb because I know my
psychiatrists are learning a lot more
about the condition bipolar through me
than through any book and I&#39;m currently
in the market for a new psychiatrist so
and lastly are my parents the Sherpas
with the largest load I don&#39;t think any
parents wants to watch their grown child
struggle as I have my parents are
everything to me
and they&#39;ve been saddled with not only
the financial implications of my
diagnosis but the emotional turmoil of
my just watching me deteriorate and I&#39;m
a Sherpa in my own way too because of my
first-hand experience I help others
understand what the condition is we have
to be open about it we must come
of our closets and be the force that
pushes mental health over the tipping
point
thank you
[Music]
Sherpas don&#39;t give up they don&#39;t judge
if you need a Sherpa reach out and get
one or two or five invest your resources
and then I received a powerful quote the
other day from one of my Sherpas I don&#39;t
know who wrote it but I need to share it
as I close when I is replaced by we even
illness becomes wellness thank
[Applause]
you
