take this job and shove it
hump day thank God it&#39;s Friday Sunday
night blues so I&#39;m sure you all have
heard these popular terms about jobs but
did you know that most heart attacks
happen Monday morning and a lot of them
are related to job stress so the
question I ask do we all really hate our
jobs as much
well 2/3 of us do according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics 51% of the
American workforce are disengaged at
work so basically you just don&#39;t want to
be there another 16% are actively
disengaged so what does this mean they
go around the workplace they mow they
complain about everything and bring the
morale of the workforce down how many
people work with somebody about like
that ok so another rinse is interesting
fact the length of time you stay in your
job is not determined by whether you
like it or whether you don&#39;t like it so
for those 1/3 of people who actually
like their jobs and I think you guys
have a secret you leave your jobs at the
same rate so if you&#39;re 45 years and
older like me you will stay in your jobs
an average of 7 to 10 years if you&#39;re
under 45 you guys will stand your jobs
an average of 5 years but if you&#39;re
millennial you&#39;ll stay in your does
about 2 years maybe they have something
figured out but we&#39;re not going to go
into that today so if you sum it up you
got all these people 2/3 of the American
workforce and they&#39;d hate their jobs but
they could potentially be in their jobs
up to a decade hating it
is that what I&#39;m hearing from some of my
job transition clients the number one
reason people don&#39;t leave a job they
hate is fear they&#39;re afraid that if they
make that job job the next job might be
worse another thing that I&#39;m hearing is
they don&#39;t believe their skills are
transferable so that I really don&#39;t get
because if you work for Pepsi you can
work for coca-cola right the last reason
and this is the saddest reason of all
some of my clients believe they are too
old for a company to want them so my
message today is of hope that you can
change your job and actually transform
your life I know I was one of these
people I was in a job for 15 years that
I didn&#39;t love and I would still be there
today had not a series of events in my
life happened the first of which is a
divorce
my ex left and took two thirds over a
household income with him when he left
and if that wasn&#39;t bad enough one month
he said to me I don&#39;t have child support
this month for our three daughters under
five years old I didn&#39;t know what to do
I mean it was so tough I had to make
decisions like gee do I pay electric
this month or do we have heat this month
because I was one of those people who
did not believe I could get a job making
enough money to take care of my kids so
I did the only thing I knew how to do I
went back to school at night for 13 very
very very long years after which I
earned my bachelor&#39;s and my master&#39;s and
during this time I changed jobs within
my company to be in alignment with what
I was taken in school I had a really
supportive manager she was excited about
my education as well and we were both
looking forward to that day when I
graduated and I would
get that salary bump so I remember the
day I walked into her office and the
first thing she said to me is I&#39;m sorry
and she goes this company doesn&#39;t give
salary bumps just because you got a
degree at this point I felt like my life
from the marriage and from the low
salary for so long was like a sad
country song so I finally got the
courage to leave poverty corporation so
in my next job I doubled my income so
all of a sudden I didn&#39;t need to rely on
child support to take care of my family
it was amazing for about two years and
then my nine-to-five became 15 hours a
day 7 days a week so that family that I
now could afford to take care of I
couldn&#39;t even see them I was up against
another really tough decision so at this
point I said I have to change I have to
leave because I have no work-life
balance and I had to just quit and find
another job so I quit no family Time Inc
but here are some signs that your
overworked in your job and here you go
are you exhausted when you first wake up
in the morning are you no longer doing
those things in your life that you love
to do like going to dinner with friends
or going to concerts or anything that
you like to do in your downtime do you
lose your patience over the littlest
things this was me so that&#39;s why I had
to go so in the next job it was a little
bit better I worked some long hours but
I had my weekends off now I could see my
family I could see my friends and start
to build their life and everything was
great job was great my co-workers were
awesome manager was awesome I even
helped my manager make partner but
that didn&#39;t translate into any kind of
promotion for me for all the work I had
done I was at another crossroads do I
stay or do I leave here&#39;s another
interesting fact for every 100 females
who advance from an entry-level position
into management 130 men advance so I had
to make a decision do I stay with this
company and I chose to leave because the
writing was on the wall and when I left
my goal was to get my promotion and now
I wanted me really clear I&#39;m not
promoting job jumping I&#39;m promoting
being loyal to a company I&#39;m promoting
loving what you do because I know that
there are amazing corporations out there
they give you flexibility they give you
promotion opportunities I haven&#39;t have
one client who started in a new job and
they cater breakfast and lunches how
cool is that you give them food they&#39;ll
stay but companies are now raising the
bar to recruit the brightest and the
best
because actually from that perspective
it&#39;s hard to get good people so I left
my next job I got the promotion I got
the office I got a large team life was
wonderful until I was being asked to do
some of the most unethical things that I
just could not do so here I am at
another crossroads it was so stressful
that I eventually ended up taking a
leave of absence which was the best
thing I could have done at this time
because after all this hard work I
needed a moment to think and when I look
back over my transitions what I realized
is I changed my job to fix the problem I
changed my job to stop a pain point so
there&#39;s two things that you should do
for any relationship first no one to get
out now I have mastered that one but you
need to know before you get into a
relationship what is it that you
want the bigger picture don&#39;t just fix a
pain point so I realized what I needed
was a job that loved me respected me and
valued me but first I had to learn how
to love respect and value myself so that
was a really good lesson so on my next
job we&#39;ll just call this job home I
found a job where I could be myself I
could be comfortable and I could create
my work family I regained my life so
when I look back over the six years of
job transitions I realized some pretty
amazing things in a six year period I
quintupled my income I moved my
daughters to a better school district I
also supported my daughters all three of
them in getting their college education
I bought my dream house and I love to
host family holiday dinners and I have a
big family and we all love to get
together so life was good so I would
like to share three things with you they
may help you move forward and have a
successful job change number one face
your fear it&#39;s very difficult changing a
job and when you first start a job you
go through that probation period I
really think they need to rebrand that
and call it rock star in training also
fear in my book means false evidence
appearing real so half the things you&#39;re
worried about in that job change don&#39;t
even exist number two know your words
searching for a job is very scary
because you have all these people trying
to get that position that you want okay
the job process is all about judgment
they judge your resume they judge your
answers to those tricky interview
questions they even judge the way you
look
so my advice is remember who you are
because it really is all about mindset
be your authentic self so there&#39;s a
quote that I want to share it&#39;s by Steve
Jobs and it&#39;s about jobs ironically in
order to do great work
you must love what you do if you haven&#39;t
found it yet keep looking
just keep looking don&#39;t settle so my
wish for you is that you find a place a
job that you can call home because I
know you can change your job and
transform your life thank you
we&#39;ll take questions now
