I&#39;m coach with me for a moment
it&#39;s Wednesday 6 p.m. at Brian Coyle
community center instead of Riverside
Community a team of girls many dressed
in long dresses traditional beautiful
head scarves and wearing their tennis
shoes join me in the court to run jump
and play girl like samira it&#39;s part of
the team she comes to this dedicated
sport time because she does not feel
comfortable during her almost old boys
rec time samara girls like her are
trying to fit a school where they trust
differently than everyone else see their
brothers playing sports are inspired
also to do but they don&#39;t know or see
any girl like them playing come back
with me to the gym more girls are
arriving there shooting hoops and are
excited we do our traditional rounds we
do 10 laps around the gym and then meet
in the center of the gym to do our
stretches then we divide ourselves into
small groups to do fun drills
elimination pressure 21 horse and three
men weights but in our gym we call the
three woman weight also we do side games
one on one three on three four on four
after an hour we notice the scarves
falling off girls not focusing on the
game girls feeling very warm but
thankfully this is the two hours girls
only gym that they can feel comfortable
taking off their scarf and continue to
retain their modesty community respect
and traditions muslim women and girls
cover up for religious
reasons if you ask a Muslim woman why
she dresses the way she dresses
you&#39;ll get fright to have answers from
self-respect
it&#39;s a choice I made they want to be
treated like everyone else they want
people to be judged them for who they
are
their characters their values and not
how they look or dress in Islamic faith
modesty is humble inside and out however
there&#39;s a bigger issue off when the
girls are not in this space that they
feel comfortable plane running and
jumping they&#39;re not competing in their
school teams they&#39;re not participating
in their PE classes they&#39;re not
registering for their community teams
largely due to the uniform being
provided imagine for a moment if you ask
a football team to go into the field
without their helmet or a cross-country
Runner to go running without their shoes
I quickly learned that when apples girls
from Cedar Riverside are not alone in
fact the number of Muslim girls
participating sports is half of that of
their peers in a time where females are
participating in sports in record
numbers
some might say Muslim girls are not
participating sports because of their
religious reasons but in our religion
and the Quran both men and women are
encouraged to be physically active to
take care of their body to live in a
healthy life a recent study found that
94% of women in the senior business
played sports when they were young
compared to the 18% of Muslim female who
are participating sports today when I
learned about this was a bigger issue
than my minneapolis community I&#39;ve
decided to make sure that all girls can
start playing sports as early as
possible
a recent research has found that was
done on Muslim East African girls in the
twin cities that the first barriers to
play is access it&#39;s a physical activity
but I know that that&#39;s just one of the
problems if you remember when you and I
were in the gym together and we saw
girls scarves falling off some feeling
that their scarves were getting hot in
sight and now focusing on the game
because they were worrying about their
hey job as a coach that really got me
into saying this is not fair we have to
find a solution for this and make these
girls play freely and be proud of who
they are so with the help of girl like
Samara and girls in the program
and community members we decided to
solve the problem and decided to create
our own activewear that would enable
physical activity while upholding both
religious and cultural beliefs so what
we did we brainstorm the girls were the
center of this they helped with the
design process they helped test over 80
different fabrics they helped draw they
helped design and try on but for this to
be successful we needed our community
our elders support the parents and the
girls who were not playing so we had a
community meeting and got all their
inputs one theme that came back for both
the parents and the elders were we want
to make sure that the girls what they&#39;re
creating is something that is culture
appropriate religious appropriate that
they do not forget about their culture
that they&#39;re proud of who they are that
when they&#39;re playing they&#39;re not
worrying about anything else and for the
girls who we&#39;re not playing we asked him
how come what is one thing that will
make you play and they say well we want
something as comfortable and they&#39;re
safe so with all the idea
together what we did was we came back
and decide together to design three
different of sporty jobs that will meet
each girl which ever level of modesty
she&#39;s at so we create and again create
it and again created the prototype we
ran jump and play but even though girls
were having access to space to be
physically active and created their own
activewear that they can be physically
active and it enabled them we knew there
was still one problem role models bears
are being broken at the highest levels
international organizations are lifting
bans on head wear Muslim women can
compete wearing their jobs and scarves
this was a big deal rumors are emerging
we had our first Muslim female who
competed for the Olympic and we&#39;re
hoping to see more we want to see girls
compete in their schools in all
professional levels and see more girls
in the Olympics and we know that the
time is right now because we believe all
girls deserve to play so we got the
community involved we got the girls
exciting we say what can we call this
movement so one day we came together at
the gym that it all started and had a
conversation with the girls and say what
is something a name that means something
to you that you&#39;re proud of each girl
wrote a name we asked what it meant
there&#39;s one name coming back again and
again and women who was known for being
courageous and standing against
interests
a woman all girls when they were young
look up to and wanted to be and women
that was their hero
her name was hacia so we decided to call
our movement hacia we believe sports
that girls up for success from
establishing healthy lifestyle to
economic performance we believe all
girls should be equipped and developed
self-confidence and leadership skills if
you believe channel your inner coach and
let&#39;s create help us lift barriers so
girl like Samara can play sports proudly
and play not worrying about culturally
not worrying about her clothes so
Sameera and many girls can become
tomorrow&#39;s role models thank you
[Applause]
