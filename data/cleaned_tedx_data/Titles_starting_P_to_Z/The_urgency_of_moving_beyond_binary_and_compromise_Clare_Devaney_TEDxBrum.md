I Birmingham I&#39;ve never been called a
Bastian before I wondered where that was
go and then I&#39;m quite glad that&#39;s where
it&#39;s an end you look great
you look amazing so I&#39;m not one of our
performance acts I&#39;m actually gonna
speak about some of this stuff but um
now that I&#39;ve got this on I feel like
I&#39;m the Donna rice when we came on stage
this morning I was like the lights I
started to do jazz hands
just couldn&#39;t help myself so so I&#39;m
actually good I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing
this because this is like one of those
dreams where you think oh we had no
clothes all right I&#39;m gonna start with a
little sing-along so please join in with
me okay so phase like let&#39;s clap our
hands right clap three
it&#39;s the magic number come on you all
married three
it&#39;s the magic number one more time
three it&#39;s the magic number okay oh yeah
I was an awkward record shops at
Christmas right four is the magic number
from beginning middle and end it&#39;s a
left right and center to upper middle
and the stores the cheap seats the three
degrees the three musketeers the Three
Little Pigs stuff crackle and pop
scoring a hat-trick for Everton that&#39;s
one of my dreams our experience an to
some extent our precondition its prime
toward the three the Trinity the
triptych the third way well here&#39;s the
news we are heading into economy four
point naught and on the cusp of the
fourth Industrial Revolution it&#39;s time
for the Fourth Way but what does that
mean
okay well currently we are stuck in this
binary system of thinking it&#39;s the
thinking that governs the yes-no in out
left right of our current political
system
the key binary underpinning this thinkin
is this one the separation of economic
and social where economic is almost
exclusively defined as fiscal
financialized money cha-ching and the
social inclusion stuff on the other side
is this fluffy little nice thing that
people do in their spare time and then
we have the feared way the third way
thinking this is like the middle ground
the fence sitters let&#39;s call this the
Lib Dem space it&#39;s first of all there&#39;s
a lot of people making a lot of money in
this space a mediating the message
between one to another but also it&#39;s
full of these terms like place making
Community Development regeneration
engagement cetera let&#39;s step back and
think about what these things mean in
engagement don&#39;t two positions have to
be at distance don&#39;t you actually have
to have separation to engage in
placemaking who or what is doing the
making in Community Development is the
community doing the developing or is it
being passively developed innovation
districts creative causes because you&#39;re
only innovative or creative when you&#39;re
in that space an inclusive growth
the current darling of the policy world
much like and I think that&#39;s branded
easy and I think usually isn&#39;t easy
in my experience inclusive growth is
anything but inclusive so when we step
back and think about what these Timbs
actually mean in fact they are upholding
this binary so people might say well
what are the words matter but they must
have very much because when you think
about it that is the money on that side
and no money on this side this is
inequality in action so what I like to
think about now is this is oh that&#39;s not
the right size well oh there it is
they&#39;re in the wrong order is this
fourth way thinking so what for swing
thinking does is step back from this
binary dismiss this kind of
census of the middle ground and create a
human space a whole space which has no
part in this easy distinction stuff and
no part in this passive-aggressive
neutrality of the Third Way book creates
this room for multifaceted
pluralism and human growth now I don&#39;t
know which slide is gonna come back here
we go okay so before I said we were on
the cusp of the fourth Industrial
Revolution now if you&#39;re anything like
me you does not add say so yes that
comment and thought must Google what two
and three where well here they are so
like the steam electric and automation
that powered the three revolutions
before it this revolution is powered by
innovation what people usually think of
when they think of innovation is IT
digital tech AI all of that and that is
tech tastic that&#39;s great right but like
all of the other three it is powered by
people and to back that up here&#39;s the
World Economic Forum&#39;s top 10 skills for
2020 these are the skills are gonna
power reverend revolution for point
north complex problem solving critical
thinking creativity the top three
innately human skills and four scenes
were talking about for people management
it&#39;s not all about coding and yet we are
still stuck in the in the paradigm of
the first Industrial Revolution this is
the realm of productivity of preparation
for life in a faceless labor market of
the northern powerhouse what is that
northerners power in someone&#39;s house in
the Maldives probably now a lot of my
work has been about unpacking some of
this binary think in a binary language
this is something that I wrote on
inclusive growth a couple years ago
inclusive growth more challenging bring
them with a problematic and inherent
paradox Congress exists if it is
anything but inclusive what I have
diplomatically and I think eloquently
tried to say in 70 odd words I can say
in four you won&#39;t be surprised to know
bits for
I&#39;m going to swear now but I&#39;ve cleared
it with my mother this morning on the
phone so it&#39;s done before words are
inclusive growth is bollocks
right it&#39;s bollocks and we need to call
it out we need to call out alongside
placemaking Community Development tell
you that and I&#39;m very sad that your
mayor could instead with us to hear this
bit today right because it&#39;s okay to
tell me about your GDP and your
productivity in your startups and what a
successful economy you are but
homelessness malnutrition child poverty
not low productivity this is the sign of
a failing economy if you cannot house
and feed your citizens you are a failing
economy not a successful one
[Applause]
now this might not look very interesting
to you but believe me it&#39;s the Golden
Nugget in this this is the Nobel Prize
please what we need to do is to rethink
where we are heading in terms of growth
we cannot use the team growth without
think and what actually means because
what it means at the moment is
accumulation of wealth for some people
an accumulation of debt for other people
thank you thank you this is like the
virtual reality experience of economics
right because what it does is put you
inside economics this is a new value
system where the destination is not this
accumulation of wealth growth is not
that it&#39;s sustainability because
sustainability of our planet is not
something we do in our spare time this
is a new model which allows for
contribution so instead of extractive
economies this is about a contributory
model where people can give to place and
please can give to people now I&#39;ve
opened the door to the fourth way now
right so you&#39;re gonna start to see force
everywhere everywhere everywhere this is
just one corner from my house in
Manchester bus where it wasn&#39;t me going
out with us very colorful so there&#39;s no
three magic wishes to end this talk but
there&#39;s four things that I want you to
do although they&#39;re all called one here
playing with me slides there&#39;s four of
them
number one recognize the binary bollocks
right when you see this it&#39;s very easy
to do because what they do is take one
from a con economic and one from social
so you get good work community wealth
building this kind of thing you can see
it you can see what it is call it out
whenever you hear a civic leader talking
about an inclusive growth strategy
community please make an exercise call
out and ask them directly what do you
mean
join us in our new Twitter campaign
taken the forth and hashtag a hashtag BB
hashtag Mary bollocks hashtag what do
you mean when you are faced with a
binary choice oh yes now when they now
Sonos them step back recognize it for
what it is
recognize the sad way and choose the
fourth way because for point naught is
just around the corner and for it&#39;s the
magic number
thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
Oh
