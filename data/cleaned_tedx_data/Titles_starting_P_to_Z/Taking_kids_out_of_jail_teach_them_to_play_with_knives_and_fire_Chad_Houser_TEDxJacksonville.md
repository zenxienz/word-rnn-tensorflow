anybody here in the audience have
parents that told him that college was
not optional as mandatory that when they
graduated high school they had to go to
college pretty good number of you I did
to that plan backfired on my parents
when I went to college and told him I
was majoring in English literature I did
tell him that I loved cooking and when I
graduated college got my mandatory
degree I was going to try cooking my dad
of all people and if you knew my dad you
would know how improbable it was that he
told me that I should follow my passion
and I should cook and so I went to
culinary school and I graduated and it
was about 10 years later that I
confronted him and I said dad you
weren&#39;t really pushing me to follow my
passion you were thinking the hell&#39;s he
gonna do with the degree in English
literature
and my dad just looked at me and smiled
and patted me on the back and said but
you love what you do so to shade that I
went to culinary school and graduated I
had one goal in mind I was gonna be an
executive chef and I was going to own my
own restaurant and in 2007 I did it I
sold my house I took out a loan I bought
into a restaurant the economy crashed
but still in that first year of
ownership I grew the business 38% and I
was nominated for best up-and-coming
chef in Dallas that first year I went
out to a Dallas County juvenile
detention facility and taught eight
young men to make ice cream for an ice
cream competition at the Dallas farmers
market the moment I met those eight
young men I realized immediately that I
had stereotyped them before I ever met
him the way they walk the way they talk
thug hood gangster I knew I was wrong
because all eight of them looked me in
the eyes and all eight of them called me
sir now I&#39;ve cooked for 20 years now
and I&#39;ve been called a lot of names and
a lot of languages and a lot of kitchens
no language was it ever sir if I was
lucky it was chef without an adjective
in front of it if these kids were so
enthusiastic to learn they were so
energetic about doing something that
they could be proud of and for all eight
of them you could tell as a first-time
feeling never mention the fact that to
them raspberry was a flavor of candy
they had never seen or tasted a fresh
raspberry so you can imagine what
happened when I tried to make him eat
fresh tarragon they thought I was making
him eat grass we made ice cream in two
days later the county bust them down to
the farmers market and these kids stood
so proud alongside College culinary
students and at the end of the
competition one of the young men
actually won the whole thing beat the
college students and everybody and when
he won first thing he did was he came
running up to me bend his knees cocked
his arms and in my face screaming at the
top of his lungs
sir I just love to cook and I did the
only thing that I could possibly think
to do in that moment I bet my knees
cocking arms and got right in his face
and scream and he said when he got out
of jail he was gonna get a job in a
restaurant well then he asked my
professional opinion sir do you think I
should work at Wendy&#39;s or Chili&#39;s and of
course I professionally told him
wherever hires you first and then
whoever pays you the most money second
and I drove home that day realizing two
things number one is I was never gonna
see him again
he was a child under custody of the
Juvenile Department they were not gonna
give a stranger his private information
his personal information number two I
realized that at the end of the day when
he got out he was gonna go right back to
the same house the same street the same
neighborhood the same school the same
gangs the same poverty the same crime
the same drugs every single thing that
had pushed him directly on a path to
jail and I thought it&#39;s not fair it&#39;s
not right I didn&#39;t do anything to earn
my opportunity in life and he didn&#39;t do
anything to earn his path either and I
blamed every one of you and then I
realized I can blame everybody all day
long but unless I want to step up and do
something that I&#39;m just a hypocrite and
I didn&#39;t want to do that so I said I&#39;m
gonna do something I had no idea what it
was about a year had passed I was on the
phone talking to my business partner
closing down the restaurant and I was
just complaining it&#39;s been a year I&#39;ve
done nothing
I am the hypocrite I promised him I&#39;d
help him I&#39;ve done absolutely nothing
and she snapped at me and said then what
do you want to do full disclosure I had
been drinking bourbon
some good ideas happen and I said I just
want to open a restaurant let these kids
run it she&#39;s like that&#39;s not a bad idea
I was like I know and that&#39;s the idea
for cafe momentum was born it&#39;s one of
the top restaurants in Dallas it&#39;s a non
profit restaurant
it&#39;s a 12-month paid post release
internship for young men and young women
exiting Dallas County juvenile detention
facilities over the course of 12 months
we haven&#39;t even gotten to the good stuff
yet
over the course of 12 months the interns
work their way through all the stations
in a restaurant from dishwasher to prep
cook line cook bus or server host
hostess and while they&#39;re working their
way through those stations they&#39;re not
just learning employment skills they&#39;re
learning life skills and social skills
things like looking someone in the eye
when you speak to them things like
disagreeing appropriately we have a case
management team that works to build an
ecosystem of support around our interns
holistically addressing urgent needs
like housing 62% of the kids that have
work in our program are homeless health
care getting a government-issued ID all
the way to more intermediate things like
getting him a bank account getting him
back into school getting them on pace in
school teaching them parenting classes
to long term objectives like they get
ready to graduate our program they write
a resume they interview for a job with
one of our employment partners and then
they begin an externship working with
them and with us now all of this I think
sounds pretty awesome but I went around
telling people I&#39;m gonna open a
non-profit restaurant working with
juvenile offenders and the first thing
people would say is aren&#39;t all
restaurants nonprofit let&#39;s say yes at
least you know I&#39;m honest then they
would say things like so you&#39;re gonna
take kids out of jail and teach them to
play with knives in fire and you think
I&#39;m gonna give you a dollar and I would
say things like no I asked for 250,000 I
was very specific and then they would
say things like what are you gonna do
when those kids stab each other in the
kitchen those kids don&#39;t want to work
they just want to check those kids don&#39;t
know good food they can&#39;t cook in your
restaurant and I realized that I had to
break through some even bigger more
horrific Stu
types so in June 2011 we launched our
very first pop-up dinner and the idea
behind the pop-up dinners was very
simple go into one of the top
restaurants in Dallas on a Sunday night
when they&#39;re closed have the chef write
a four-course menu sell tickets to the
private dinner and then his or her staff
to not only execute the food in the
kitchen but serve it to the level and
quality of service of that restaurant
we&#39;re eight young men that we would bus
in from one of the Dallas County
juvenile detention facilities first
dinner we wanted to get 50 people to pay
50 bucks
I had no confidence that anybody would
show up I had devised a masterful plan
to call my mom and have her guilt the
ladies in her Bible study class and to
buying at least half the tickets before
we could shut down PayPal after we
announced the dinner 24 hours later we
had sold 68 seats in June of 2011 68
people showed up at a dinner and before
they left they either shook my hand or
they gave me a hug and said you know
this could be my son by December of 2011
we doubled the price from 50 to $100 and
it sold out in 15 minutes and by spring
of 2012 our dinners were selling out in
15 seconds in the summer of 2012 that
voice I wasn&#39;t drinking bourbon this
time but the voice did go off in my head
and I said you know it&#39;s one thing to
tell the kids you believe in them but
it&#39;s another thing to walk the talk and
I decided that if I wanted to prove to
the kids that I truly did believe in
them then I would bet my career on them
and so I did in September 1st 2012 I
became the first executive director and
executive chef of cafe momentum a
restaurant that was an idea and didn&#39;t
even exist the restaurant itself opened
on January 29th 2015 and in March Dallas
Morning News food critic Leslie Brunner
visited us to review us now for those of
you that aren&#39;t foodies god bless you
but those that are you may have heard of
Leslie because Leslie has a reputation
not just in Dallas but across the United
States and her reputation is that she
hates every restaurant that she goes to
review in her review of cafe momentum
she wrote that on any given night we can
go toe to toe with the best restaurants
in the city and in the fall of 2015
Dallas Observer named us best new
restaurant eater Dallas named us
restaurant of the year and those are all
accolades that we&#39;re very proud of we&#39;re
chefs we got egos but most importantly
we&#39;re proud because it proves a very
important lesson that these young men
and these young women can and will rise
to whatever level of expectation you set
for them you just have to give them the
tools the resources the love the
guidance and the support to get there
now at Cafe momentum our program extends
beyond the four walls of the restaurant
and we do research data study data
accumulate data we have one very
important statistic that we watch all
the time and that&#39;s recidivism in the
state of Texas forty eight point three
percent of the young people that go to
jail once we&#39;ll go back within twelve
months half the kids that go to jail
once we&#39;ll go back within twelve months
and in Texas it cost us as taxpayers a
hundred and twenty seven thousand
dollars to incarcerate a child with a
50/50 shot that they&#39;ll be back within
twelve months and if they go back it&#39;s
pretty much guaranteed they&#39;re gonna
spend the rest of their life going in
and out in and out in and out
at Caffe a momentum of the nearly five
hundred kids that we worked with only
fifteen point two percent have ever gone
back to jail which means that Dallas
Mayor Mike Rawlings owes me a check for
nineteen point eight million dollars
because that&#39;s how much money we&#39;ve
saved taxpayers but the mission of cafe
momentum is not to keep kids out of jail
our mission statement clearly states to
help them achieve their full potential
which is a far cry from incarceration so
I&#39;m gonna quickly tell you a story about
one of our graduates a young man named
Abbas ie Abba cyi is the son of Mexican
immigrants his parents came across the
border got jobs at immigrants kid got
murdered a family and they ended up
getting divorced and when they divorced
that meant abuse I went from from living
in poverty living in higher poverty it
meant he went from living in a bad
neighborhood to living in a really bad
neighborhood it meant that he didn&#39;t
want to ask his mom for things that she
might complain that his dad this should
provide he didn&#39;t ask his dad for things
that he would complain that his mom
should provide so he turned to the
streets to survive he turned to the
streets to figure out how to accumulate
resources to get food to get clothes
basic necessities he ended up in jail
and he went through our program he
graduated August of last year
and upon graduating went to work for one
of our employment partners large hotel
just outside downtown Dallas and within
three months at 17 years old he was
promoted from busboy to bar back and
made between 700 and $1,000 a week with
full health benefits paid vacation in a
401k
[Music]
now what that tells us is the story is
no longer about Albus ie stories about
his kids it&#39;s about his grandkids it&#39;s
about them not growing up in a household
where high school is optional because in
January I got to watch a bus I walk
across the stage as the first ever high
school graduate of his family it&#39;s about
it&#39;s about them growing up in a
household where college is not optional
because in August I got a phone call
from Abba cyi after he finished his
first day of college classes where he
plans on majoring in mechanical
engineering it&#39;s about them becoming
productive contributing leaders in their
own community and that excites us so
much because it completely changes the
narrative of they can&#39;t - they can that
we did a study and looked at if we work
with a hundred kids a year
what is the generational effect if Caffe
momentum works with a hundred kids a
year the effect across five generations
is over 2,500 lives every year
if caffee momentum works with a hundred
kids a year and you take the money you
save by keeping five generations from
repeating a cycle of incarceration and
you add the money that they contribute
back into their own communities the ones
that need it the most
the total is 389 million dollars now I
never I never did get that degree in
English literature but I&#39;m pretty sure
if you looked it up in the dictionary
that would be the definition of momentum
thank you
you
