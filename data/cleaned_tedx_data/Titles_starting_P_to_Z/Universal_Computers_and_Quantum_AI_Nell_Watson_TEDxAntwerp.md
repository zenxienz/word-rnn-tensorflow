Computers today are really sophisticated
aren&#39;t they it seems as if that every
single day there&#39;s some incredible new
capability that&#39;s being talked about in
the news for about 60 or 70 years
computers we&#39;re built upon an
architecture of one central processing
unit a CPU doing tasks sequentially one
after another and yet in the past couple
of years we&#39;ve seen vast new powerful
parallel computational techniques the
ability to execute lots of instructions
all at once and it&#39;s these capabilities
that enable amazing new graphical
whiz-bang capabilities and very
sophisticated AI and also the ability to
do complex parallel computations for
things like blockchain these new forms
of complex parallel computations and
they blow things as well mapping complex
systems well for the first time I began
to look at different models of how to
simulate different complex natural
interactions for example different gases
diffusing into each other and I began to
have a very strange thought there were
complex mathematical instructions being
executed in order to simulate this
process but what if there was the
inverse what if in actual fact whenever
these kinds of physical processes happen
there is a computational process
happening and I sat with this thought
for a long time and I really boggled on
it and I decided to do some research and
I discovered that a few years ago some
scientists decided to take a bucket of
water and agitate it using voices like
saying a word like zero or one and by
observing the input and the output they
could turn this into a form of neural
net
work basically a perceptron
pattern-recognition in a bucket weird
huh
I mean we think of computation as
requiring silicon chips and yet
computation can happen in physical media
as well what a strange idea I began to
look at this physical computing idea a
little bit further and I discovered some
other research using things such as this
hot iced sodium acetate and as these
crystals expand in fact they are doing
computations so they are finding the
optimal way to split up into little
cells all of these different crystals in
a sense this is like a geometric
computer but built from purely natural
forms there is a technique evolving at
the moment called reservoir computing
and it means that you can turn physical
different physical properties of
materials into complex computation here
these are little silver nano wires and
I&#39;m sure whenever you were younger your
grandmother maybe told you not to put a
silver spoon near an egg right because
it would form a black mass and that&#39;s
called silver sulfide and in these
silver wires these little bits of silver
sulfide can form and in fact it means
that they turn into little sine apses so
some of the connections are stronger
than others and by passing a small
amount of electrical current through
these something very akin to natural
human or animal neural networks begins
to arise basically it&#39;s like an abiotic
or an a biological form of computation a
form of neural network that arises just
from physical media in the natural world
there are some hypotheses that creatures
like spiders use their webs to create a
kind of a natural
computer the same way that a market
trader might use an abacus to help us
doing computations it&#39;s a sort of
extended cognition doing calculations
using something in the environment take
a look at the slime mold it&#39;s a very
simple creature looks a little bit like
dog vomit to me and yet this simple and
not terribly aesthetically pleasing
creature is capable of some amazing
computational feats it&#39;s a single-celled
organism and we think of it as just a
big blob but if we look at it on a scale
of time that is a little bit different
from our own we noticed that it is in
fact probing its environment and making
decisions about whether to explore or to
exploit in essence this little
single-celled organism has agency it&#39;s
able to choose things that it prefers
one or the other and in fact you can do
experiments where you can put a slime
mold in between different multiple
sources of food and it turns out that
they like protein they prefer when they
have about 30 percent protein in their
food and they will choose the food that
they prefer a single-celled organism is
capable of agency and they&#39;re also
capable of it when they all come
together biofilms can form when lots of
different little single-celled organisms
like bacteria get together and they live
in little cities and they exchange
resources with each other because the
ones on the outside they take the brunt
of damage but they protect the ones on
the inside and there&#39;s a kind of an
exchange so the ones on the outside get
more of the resources because they&#39;re
doing more of the work and in fact it
turns out that bacteria can recruit
others even bacteria of other species
they kind of send like little wet
messages to each other you know like
Yolo or what&#39;s up or come and join the
party
and they do this through electrical
means in a sense it&#39;s electronic in the
membranes of cells there are ion
exchange channels and these enable forms
of electronic communication between
bacteria and they can also function a
little bit like a neural network in a
sense weird huh
what&#39;s I find really weird is that cells
like this make up all of our bodies
trillions of them and all of these
little cells are like little nano
machines and so in many ways we are the
emergent construction of trillions of
different nano machines all operating
together and that&#39;s an order of
magnitude less than the number of
microbes that we have in our bodies and
we can&#39;t live without those those are an
essential part of our bodies doing their
thing trillions and trillions of little
cells all working together we think of
our brains as being the epitome of
intelligence and they are very
sophisticated of course but there&#39;s only
86 billion neurons or so in the average
human brain and yet there are trillions
and trillions of cells and perhaps
there&#39;s hundreds or even thousands of
times more computation within our cells
operating together than in our brains
per se and all of these cells have their
own little agencies they&#39;re all choosing
and optimizing for different things even
these neurons this is a cultured neurons
cell and look observe and behold as it
explores its environment and it&#39;s
looking for the optimal connections with
other neurons in a sense these little
neurons are forming alliances with each
other and from those alliances we get
the emergent property of consciousness
one definition of intelligence is the
ability to triangulate information from
multi
different viewpoints and it seems as if
these little tiny intelligences are
searching for different potential
options in the future choosing the best
one reaching forward and bringing it
back into the present there&#39;s an aspect
of biology called quantum biology and it
looks at how quantum processes influence
how biological organisms function things
like olfaction smelling things
navigation photosynthesis all of these
processes use quantum mechanical
processes to operate and bacteria do the
same evidence suggests that bacteria use
a machine learning technique known as a
random walk but they do it in a quantum
fashion a quantum random walk which is
orders of magnitude more sophisticated
than our finest computational algorithms
perhaps we can harness some of these
capabilities that bacteria have we
currently do not in our technology to
amplify and create new forms of
artificial intelligence that we can
scarcely imagine today there are other
methods by which the universe is
optimized and decisions are made our
entire universe is winding down a
pattern called entropy and eventually
that&#39;s going to lead to the heat death
of the universe as everything gradually
gets colder and colder and little bits
of gas and heat diffuse until there&#39;s
one big empty negation of matter and
energy basically everything just
distributes until everything&#39;s so thin
you can&#39;t do anything and yet life is
something that can avoid this process
through something called negative
entropy
basically life itself is an orderly
decay of energy States and we all
require new information and new energy
in order to combust and survive and life
is a semi stable organization which
means that we take in lots more energy
we combust it and in so doing we avoid
coming to an end of entropy ourselves or
at least we can offset it for a
generation or so through this process
all life has evolved and all life is
trying to maximize its entropy maximize
the amount of energy that it can combust
and it seems as if there have been many
different phase shifts throughout the
history of the universe as this process
of negative entropy has gotten more
sophisticated a hydrogen atom might
wander the universe and for billions of
years hardly enter a star or enter a
planet or do anything interesting in its
complexity and then it suddenly finds
itself inside simple organism like a
bacteria and the amount of complexity in
the amount of energy that is passing
through that process is vastly increased
and then it might move into plants and
insects more complex structures and from
there from prokaryotic into eukaryotic
cells ever more sophisticated levels of
complexity and negative entropy and from
there we get consciousness and
consciousness has enabled another level
of energy combustion thanks to human
beings ever more complex forms of
combustion and the most complex we&#39;ve
discovered so far our computational
abilities themselves
it seems as if our universe has gone
through many different stages in its
history the age of radiation and then
cooling into matter and thanks to the
properties of entropy in the universe
life beginning to form and in
particularly complex forms of life that
began to emerge consciousness and
consciousness like you and me
created a new form of life called
technology and technology is now
enabling vastly new layers of complex
computation and negative entropy that
have never been seen before to me this
is perhaps how we begin to unite the
spiritual with the scientific the
numerical with the numinous I cannot
help but behold in awe and joy the
majesty of our computational universe
and I invite you to celebrate this with
me thank you
you
