I&#39;m live and I am the editor-in-chief of
garden and I&#39;m Charlie and I&#39;m the print
editor academ and Gavin started in end
of the summer of 2015 and it was really
just an online magazine in which we were
trying to support the journalistic
talents of women of color because our
voices are rarely heard in mainstream
media but as we&#39;ve kind of grown in our
careers and with Geron we realized that
they were like lots of different gaps of
things that we could tap into
so we&#39;ve ventured into various other
things so now we kind of call ourselves
a creative collective we put on politics
panels and comedy nights and we also
make a print magazine each year as you
may have guessed from the title of our
talk we&#39;re both very busy women and so
we&#39;re here today to talk to you about
what it&#39;s like to be rushing all of the
time planning this talk has been
actually a bit of a nightmare because
like Liv is always busy I&#39;m was busy and
we don&#39;t really seem to melt our
schedules very well we have we have a
very intense that very loving friendship
me and Charlie
so since 2015 when Garnon started we&#39;ve
essentially communicated in a bit of a
crazy rush of text messages and I think
to a lot of people this kind of
communication would appear stressful
quite disorganized and an overall pain
to us it&#39;s just become normality and our
conversations know no bounds so we send
each other emails at all hours of the
night and I frequently wake up to
Charlie Brooker scoffs Charlie bring
come on Charlie pretty girls go and I
know it&#39;s the same for her texts and
emails are definitely not confined to
office hours and me and Charlie will try
reply to each other within 20 or 30
minutes for receiving a text yeah I mean
it&#39;s not a rule but like I think it&#39;s
generally more like about 10 seconds
after receiving a text so I&#39;m live
things that I&#39;m romantic when she is but
she&#39;s actually definitely more romantic
than I am as I think this text
conversation sort illustrates she&#39;s like
standard ask yeah so this was sort of at
the I think it was maybe a few days
before our print lon
I live with stressing a lot as he
couldn&#39;t she decided that she was gonna
go and chant like do something this
chance to try and chill out a little bit
but yeah the print magazine was kind of
one of the most stressful times of my
life so far it was 300 pages when it&#39;s
only supposed to be 266 40 pages over we
had more than like 60 like written
contributions and I think like maybe at
least 40 illustrators and it six
examples you put it together a lot but
that&#39;s not all that we talked about no
we talked about everything we talked
about I love flies to talk about our
family lives our personal lives but one
thing that consumes us quite a lot is
the racism and microaggressions that we
face as work at work as women of color
and the fact that sometimes people can
be the worse so this can be anything
from people putting their hands into
Charlie&#39;s hair it can be people being
overtly racist or it could be people
coming up to you and using slang words
because you&#39;re the only like black or
brown person in the office and they
think that obviously you know what
everything even though I&#39;m from Scotland
I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know any of this urban
slang so yeah I feel like the list of
things that we could talk about laughing
in media know no bounds and there was
some text conversations that we wanted
to include where we kind of reference
where they&#39;re working and we just
thought we don&#39;t get fired yeah but we
also talked about sort of you know more
personal and sort of I guess upsetting
things as well and I think both of us
find it really hard to switch off
sometimes so this example here was when
I can attend
sadly the funeral of one of live family
members because essentially we had to
gather than print prices and so yeah
that was that&#39;s why so yeah so for me on
a personal level I suffer from like
chronic stress induced migraines and
when I was in my funding of University
and garden had just started and I was
doing my dissertation I was working a
full-time job my headaches got so bad
this is when I did have a bit of her
that on the most tense parts of my head
like my hair was starting to thin and
like fall out and then Charlie on the
other hand she gets a twitch when she&#39;s
really stressed and nervous and is
literally walking around like this she
also gets RSI repetitive strain injury
because she&#39;s just furiously typing all
of the
and I think it was at this point that we
realized that actually moving its full
speed for 80% of the day might not be
the healthiest way you know about things
know even though it&#39;s seen as the cool
thing to be doing to you forever own it
it&#39;s like a glamorize trip right thing
it feels a bit to sort of like be doing
anything worthwhile if someone is asking
you a question about like how are you
you&#39;d have to be like I&#39;m busy I&#39;m
stressed and or else it&#39;s like not a
legitimate doing yeah yeah you&#39;re not
doing anything as well but like the idea
but just because we&#39;re young and we have
energy that we should sort of be able to
like balance like a great like sex life
and have like really good friendships
and I also like retain a sense of humor
it&#39;s kind of like it&#39;s unachievable and
like it&#39;s kind of wild so yeah this is
where the kind of rushing woman of color
syndrome comes in so historically the
experiences of us as women of color are
written into research history books
political debates like we&#39;re not seen
and I think often when you do see when
you do see these issues written about
you get B AMA as one distinct category
and then you get women as another
distinct category but you rarely see the
two fused and obviously as women of
color being surrounded by lots of
different women who have like a similar
shared experience we know that there&#39;s
this kind of commonality which ties us
together but we we lack this kind of
framework or reference point and kind of
like language through which to clearly
articulate our experiences and the
struggles that we face so I stumbled
across this theory called Russian woman
syndrome which was developed by dr.
Libby Weaver
some time ago and she was focusing on
the kind of emotional impacts of being a
mother with children and working and
taking on like the domestic and also the
emotional and me and the employment kind
of burdens but I was like kind of like
looking at my relationship by having
myself in the relationship that I had
with other women around me and we
thought it could be quite useful for us
to take her theory and create like a
semi satirical one which could which
took the basic premise of what she was
talking about but situated it in like
2017 and the current kind of
socio-economic cultural and political
climate in order to look at the ways in
which rushing young particularly young
women of color operate and like the
reasons for that and yeah the reason why
this was interesting for me was because
I guess I&#39;d sort of tried to do some
thing about a year ago when I wrote an
article about women of color who suffer
from imposter syndrome so imposter
syndrome is when you don&#39;t feel worthy
of any of the achievements that you like
have like literally made for yourself
and a lot of women of color seem to
suffer from that as well
disproportionately so this like idea
really really fascinated me I mean it to
be clear neither of these are like
clinically recognized and it made it up
we made it up but we think it is like we
think it&#39;s super relevant and useful
yeah yeah I think in terms of like
having an actual term which can
encapsulate just how tough it can be to
be a busy young woman like the highs and
the lows that come with that is really
is really a useful one for us and you
know we&#39;re surrounded by women that move
at 100 miles an hour who are doing
really brilliant things and they&#39;re
taking up space but actually they&#39;re
kind of a lot of the time really taking
the time to breathe and check in on
themselves on their physical and their
mental well-being yeah and like don&#39;t
starting they are like thriving because
of it like I don&#39;t know I think Nicole&#39;s
what we told you about this already but
last week she put on the amazing black
girl festival would pull that pant and
hundreds of young black women came down
this girl has like a million on one side
Olivia and then we have other people
that we work with often like babes who
are doing the most for LGBTQ POC in
London and also Nia who put on who
created this like set of to them yeah
literally like New Sun has so many
emotes what&#39;s important to mention is
that even when we love what we do
because of the intersections that we
sort of embody between like race class
gender it&#39;s hard it&#39;s really hard for us
yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s hard for us to sort
of to put ourselves above all our white
counterparts so I think in terms of if
you look at the current political
socio-economic climate in the UK it&#39;s
clearly not one which is stacked in the
favor of women of color and that&#39;s
pretty much across the board at all
levels of society and in all aspects of
society so this can be whether it&#39;s you
know dealing with microaggressions in
the workplace for example being told
that you&#39;re not smiling enough that&#39;s a
common one being used as the replacement
for urban dictionary I&#39;ve been asked to
define like what pea and peg and stuff
means so frequently by people in my
workplace or what it could be something
like wondering whether the length of
your name is preventing you from getting
job interviews it could be having people
in the office judging you because you&#39;re
part of a
positive action scheme or assuming that
the only reason that you were there is
because you got there through one of
those so I would say that the day to day
hurdles which we as a man of color face
in the workplace can be rife and I
realized that I may sound like an angry
black woman but I feel like you&#39;d be
angry too if you knew that last year it
was found that under Tory measures of
austerity women of color were the
hardest hit across the board and that
would be feeling those effects until
2020 and this is despite the fact that
we weren&#39;t frequently featured in these
debates about the cuts and our
experiences are clearly very real or
he&#39;d be annoyed about he&#39;d be angry
about the fact that last year again it
was found that low-income vme women were
to lose double the amount of money due
to the government&#39;s cuts to public
services and that of white men and then
when you look at things like our mental
and our physical well-being just last
month it was found how 4,800 and every
100,000 black British adults were in
contact with the NHS for secondary
mental health services and that is
things like depression suicidal thoughts
and that&#39;s in comparison with 3,600 and
every 100,000 adults overall or the fact
that black Caribbean are lots are the
most likely to be detained on the Mental
Health Act and these statistics and
figures can go on and go on and on and
on even though as you said it&#39;s really
hard to find one specifically about
women of color they do go on so situated
journalistic context which is obviously
where I come from as you can see on the
screen 94 percent of journalists are
white and 55 percent of them are male
which is totally disproportionate and
that totally reflects my experiences of
like newsrooms as well like I&#39;ll go in
I&#39;m just like hi I&#39;m the only brown face
here yeah and I think it&#39;s um it&#39;s
important to note as well that there are
now 20 percent more female journalists
coming into the industry than there are
male so hopefully that will change at
some point in the future but it&#39;s so
like senior management in journalism is
often I think the same in TV as well
yeah you look at commissioner level
things yeah but I just wanted to point
out this example from today this
headline I don&#39;t know if any of you guys
have seen this but basically this this
got through the editorial team at the
Daily Mail like obviously it&#39;s our Daily
Mail but I like to think that this like
awful headline what will women gain from
all the skulking about sex pass and
niqab which obviously references a sort
of like me to era that we&#39;re moving into
at the moment I don&#39;t think this
headline would have got passed if a
woman of color had been it would be the
editor of The Daily Mail or in any
senior positions at the Daily Mail I
really do
we would hope not yeah but anyway
despite how bleak all of this may sound
we&#39;re clearly working hard to see
ourselves represented because we haven&#39;t
been visible like in these prominent
positions up until this point and we&#39;re
very much surrounded by women who
channeled their frustrations and their
anger into projects and startups and
initiatives which are designed to fill a
gap because what would these be in us as
women of color begging for inclusion
from people who have repeatedly
disregarded the validity of our
experiences yeah so I guess we have to
think about like how do we stop rushing
and do we even want to because we&#39;re
aware of how important the work we&#39;re
doing is and like even though we don&#39;t
really like encourage anyone to live as
like as manically as we do and like find
a friend that they can text like all
hours of the night because it&#39;s might be
a bit much there is obviously like a
side to us at relishes in the fact that
we&#39;re always so creating and
communicating with each other and
actually hopefully changing things in
our in small way so I think asks me
Charlie and the rest of the garden team
are going to continue to work and pour
every spare second and bit of out like
passion and things that we can into this
project to like make sure that it grows
it continues to grow but I think one
thing that&#39;s also really important for
us and for me and Charlie in particular
is the fact that we&#39;re working on
building self care as an ongoing
practice so rather than it being like
something that we do on the one-off it
being something that we do on the daily
or in the weekly on the monthly on the
yearly to ensure that actually our
mental and physical well-being is number
one on the list of things to do in like
excelling is number two on the list of
things to do yeah and I think it&#39;s
important to mention that Liv has
actually been in bed ill this past week
but the strange thing is that although
she has been working from bed like I
think maybe the live of like a year ago
would have just like gone into work with
the flu so she is getting like a
slightly slightly better yeah Charlie
how RSI hasn&#39;t flared up for two months
so that&#39;s like an impressive achievement
on her part
and I haven&#39;t seen the twitch for a
while yes good at times often we feel
overworked and we feel that we&#39;re
largely underrepresented and I
definitely thrive of being constant
I would say that me and Charlie Connor
don&#39;t have an off switch
and although I&#39;m working hard to
cultivate one I think being surrounded
by an abundance of women with a similar
shared experience in gal dam has given
me the confidence to and both of us the
confidence to take up space and know
that our voices are valued and should be
counted
