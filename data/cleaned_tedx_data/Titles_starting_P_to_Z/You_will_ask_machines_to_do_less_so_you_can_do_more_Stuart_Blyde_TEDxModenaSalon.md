my name&#39;s Jo blight and I&#39;m here to talk
about how robots are gonna save your
relationships now when I practice this
at the weekend with my boy he&#39;s six
years old and I thought I need to make
sure that he can understand what we&#39;re
going to talk about so when we sat down
I said son I&#39;m going to moderner
I&#39;m going to speak about robots to a
city full of cars and innovation he&#39;s
robots robots fantastic can I have a
robot I said
Seve that&#39;s the name of my boy Seve why
do you want to robot tell me why you
want to robot he says I want to robot
because all my Lego is all smashed up
and I need the robot to put the Lego
back together and so I said to him son
you don&#39;t need a robot for that I can do
it and he said daddy you too busy you&#39;re
only a laptop you&#39;re on your mobile
phone you haven&#39;t got time you need a
robot I need a robot to build the Lego
now you&#39;ll see why this is important in
a moment because I&#39;m I&#39;m in digital
that&#39;s my work
but actually I&#39;m going to advocate a
world of stopping the usage of the phone
and embracing robots so we can get back
to enjoying our relationships okay what
I&#39;d like to do I&#39;ve shared a little bit
of my story I&#39;d like to get you guys
involved now so if you could just get
your mobile phone out and just hold it
in your hand I&#39;m going to ask a question
and then when I ask it I want you to put
your phone up if you think it&#39;s true so
the first question I have for you
is one which is around second screening
now second screening just for the
definition it&#39;s where you&#39;re using your
mobile phone and you&#39;re watching
television so good example I&#39;m at home X
Factor&#39;s on can&#39;t stand X Factor I&#39;m on
the phone okay watching the American
football now I want to find out a few
guys second screen so if you second
screen put your hand up I want to see
roughly what the audience is here so it
looks like quite a large percentage
probably the majority second screen now
bear in mind what my son told me about
time I think there&#39;s a bit of a
challenge there on society so my next
question I&#39;m going to follow up that I
want you guys to also interact with is
one which is around your your the top
five people in your life the five people
that are the most important to your life
not the friends that you went to school
with twenty years ago that you get an
update and like because they&#39;ve got a
new cat the five people that really mean
something to you now do you think the
mobile phone has improved your
relationships with the top five people
in your life that&#39;s a tricky one that I
need to put your phone up if you think
the mobile phone has improved now there
are a lot of people that is yes because
of connectivity so I just want to have a
quick look around so let&#39;s have a look
has the mobile phone improved your
relationships there&#39;s a few but there&#39;s
not many of you and that&#39;s kind of the
nub of the issue that I want to talk
about now I can use another data point
so the next data point is there&#39;s a
recent study that says that we spend
eight hours a day on our mobile phone
now that&#39;s more time than that most
people sleep yeah just think of that
eight hours on your phones and your
laptops and that&#39;s more time than than
you sleep now if you work that out in
your life this is where it gets really
worrying let&#39;s just take an average life
expectancy now we&#39;re in Italy you guys
live a long time more than the Brits are
eat fish and chips but if we just look
at the I&#39;m British so I can say that if
you actually look at an average life
expectancy simplify it 80 years first
ten years of your life you&#39;re not on the
phone now I know that&#39;s not true because
my daughter&#39;s always on Netflix okay
the last ten years of your life you&#39;re
not on your phone now my dad lovely man
73 he&#39;s on his phone a lot so I know
that&#39;s not true as well 60 years in
between the two a third of 60 years
because we know it&#39;s eight hours a day
that&#39;s 20 years of your life on screens
just ever think about that I know I
would prefer it spending time building
my son smashed up Lego or going to the
zoo or going to the park and playing
frisbee now when you look at that that&#39;s
a 20-year stretch of your life on
screens but there is hope coming around
the corner in the form of a robot okay
now I think we need this help because
the screen abuse is everywhere it&#39;s not
just in our living rooms you can&#39;t even
go to a concert can you don&#39;t watch
Britney Spears or whoever it is you&#39;ve
got an iPhone in your face it&#39;s
everywhere we&#39;ve got to get rid of the
mobile phone phenomenon now the robotic
help is around the corner now just want
to do this is nearly the end of the
sampling I just want to find out who in
the audience has already got a robot at
home
so if you got robust at home I want you
to put your hand in there anyone got a
robot can&#39;t see many people can&#39;t see
hardly anyone with a robot
now you have got a robot it&#39;s just how
we define the word robot because
actually this is a robot and when you
look at Google for example it knows 8
o&#39;clock 9 o&#39;clock every morning I go to
London
5 o&#39;clock 6 o&#39;clock get on the train
come back and going home so it knows
where I live and it knows where I work
it knows what train I&#39;ll get and it
tells me information about Ito&#39;s quickly
because the train in London&#39;s late again
you need to get going
so serving us information is a way of
robotics that&#39;s a really simple one you
guys all know that most of you do that
already now that&#39;s got to be a lot
better to be consuming that type of
information than to be in the world
where it&#39;s tap tap tap tap tap tap tap
in putting all this data over 20 years
and getting how much return of
investment on all that effort that we
put into the screen now if you look at
the algorithms in the world that we&#39;re
getting to what you find is it&#39;s not
just the kind of google examples but
here we are in wonderful modern ER and
actually the autonomous car as we&#39;ve
talked about and we&#39;ve heard from others
is another form of robotics that&#39;s going
to solve this 20 years on screens so
currently today if you take 15 minutes
to get in your car and fill it up and
then you come back home and then in the
afternoon you go to the shops you spend
45 minutes going to get all your
shopping in the autonomous world again
most people in this audience certainly
know this but the car can drive itself
and pick up the energy that you need and
it can open the boot and someone can put
in the fresh food that you need so when
it turns up at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning
we&#39;ve got the smell of fresh bread that
turns up with your car now that&#39;s one
hour of that eight hours that we&#39;ve got
to eat in the-- we need to start making
movements into allowing robots to start
getting back to the fact that we can
start living like a society and not
second screening because I think that&#39;s
a better world that we can start to live
in now who are the types of companies
that are going to be there we already
know that there are some now but I think
we&#39;re going to start to see this shift
and it&#39;s happening right now we&#39;re
starting to see the shift where you move
out of a Stone Age and into the Bronze
Age so this is for us moving out of the
screen and moving in to allowing the
robot to start giving us the information
it&#39;s not going to be about apps anymore
it&#39;s not going to be who&#39;s got the best
app it&#39;s actually gonna be who&#39;s
actually serving you the right
information that you need
that&#39;s contextual that stops you
spending eight hours of your life
tapping away eight hours your day sorry
tapping away putting information in got
to get that twenty years back I don&#39;t
want anyone in this room to have to do a
20-year stretch that&#39;s like a prison
sentence we&#39;ve got to start embracing
robots because I think that robots if we
embrace them then robots will embrace us
when we have to have robots in our life
and with our families and I think that&#39;s
a better world to live in and I think
for me robots improving relationships
that is an idea worth spreading thank
you very much
