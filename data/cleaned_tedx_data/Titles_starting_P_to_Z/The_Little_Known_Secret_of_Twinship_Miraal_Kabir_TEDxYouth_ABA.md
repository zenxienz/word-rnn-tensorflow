I am a fraternal team and I think that
most wins will be able to relate when I
say that there are two to three
questions we get asked as soon as people
find out that we are twins the first
question is the one that is probably
running through your mind right now is
whether me and my twin brother can read
each other&#39;s minds I hate to disappoint
you right at the beginning of my speech
but no we cannot read each other&#39;s minds
and I can assure you we have spent
countless hours trying this headache
question is often a physical one like
that you don&#39;t look the same or are wise
his hair brown in yours black almost as
though we forget to type mistake that
morning the question that I personally
get is why did you steal all of these
Heights but that&#39;s my cue to begin by
one with her speech about who I&#39;m
enjoying my glory why like that because
he&#39;ll likely end up think much taller
and then there&#39;s a third question and
that&#39;s the question people ask us once
if they&#39;re equal to look beyond our
physical differences and relate to us
and more personal level this question is
not one of curiosity or pointing out
etiquette differences the one of utter
surprise sometimes even as though their
belief is that we profound as he
shattered to the core some of the along
the lines of how on earth are you so
different and that&#39;s the question I&#39;d
like to address with you today
somebody begin by then they win on the
little known secret of twinship thus
paternal twins are no more like
siblings me and my brother share 50% of
genetic data only as much as you and
Jessica Lee but we do end up being polar
opposites for one simple reason and that
is you let me explain you see a skill
that we humans have perfected perhaps
better than most other skills is that of
classification for ages we have to
classify people and things into groups
based on their attributes this helps us
make sense of them so then we know how
we&#39;re going to relate to them we won&#39;t
get too close with somebody we consider
it to be a stranger
just as we won&#39;t use a pencil to pet a
cucumber although I have seen some
unnamed friends try that one dozen
occasions helped us work there&#39;s a
billions of bits of data coming at us in
every moment
it&#39;s comprehensible parts so that we can
go about our day to day lives without
having to understand everything we
encounter from the very beginning as a
twin I&#39;ve experienced this way too often
people usually ask this question
starting with so which one did he was
followed by a general adjective in one
of these questions are near aids
to help them classify us as two separate
entities the automatic imply that only
one twin can have certain character
traits and the other by consequence must
be lacking it if people find my body to
be vivacious they automatically
I see the fire early if he&#39;s good at
none I must be the writer if he is
having a down day I made up to be the
perfectional optimist and while of these
arbitrary classifications had nothing to
do with who we really are
the irony is that we take it upon
ourselves to maintain them why because
when you&#39;re at life aren&#39;t being one of
two peas in a pod you have to figure out
a way to stand down we have to cling on
to the parts of yourself that make you
different you have to make yourself seen
at all cost you can call it a survival
mechanism growing up I remember going
out as a family and my period
introducing a sport children in this
exact manner
this is maja the eldest Iman the
youngest and those are the twins the
twins that lose it no name no identity
and so from a very young age it was up
to me to create one but that&#39;s where it
got a little messy because as it would
all know much too well given you our
molecules one&#39;s the best in childhood is
always a little messy we exaggerate what
we remember we leave out the bits that
we don&#39;t want and we forget to smooth
out the edges now that I&#39;m older I can
appreciate that the world is not only
black or white that opposites work in
harmony to enhance each other but the
darkness makes it light seemed brighter
and that any color can bring its
complementary color alive as an art
student I&#39;ve experimented with this and
here&#39;s what I&#39;ve found
most people see this as a yellow sheet
of paper and unless you have Bayan
I&#39;m sure that you&#39;d agree in reality
though it is a beautiful painting except
that it is painted with yellow on yellow
with no contrast to give its shape what
you see is nothing
now watch what happens as I slowly start
bringing out the purple in the painting
and see how the more conscious there are
the more the painting stands out this
taught me something about human nature
that I missed out when I was little in
my grudge to send out for my brother as
so we forgot the parts of myself that
made me different to him I believe a
yellow or olive blue or red or pink or
black not realizing that it was my inner
celeritas my white and my dreams and my
purples that truly helped me to stand
out I think that the artists of the
Renaissance understood this wealth as a
painted canvas it&#39;s who earned us at the
border and angels in the sky humans were
in the center indicated that we all have
our animalistic and divine tendencies
within us we have the good and the bad
the love and the hate the optimist and
the pessimist
the introvert and extrovert the artist
the mathematician and every color and as
polar opposite within us and it is these
very opposites that work together to
make this bowl and genie I&#39;m learning to
understand
but although me and my brother may have
looked at the yin and yang in the utrom
even the year because the
within it as the gang has begin and
beginning to think but the age Bowl
there Gervais nature debate and
wondering about the type of person that
would have become an external forces not
box me into a certain image of who I am
and the chance appreciate that opposites
were determining that the darkness side
on fragments there are weaknesses
highlight our strengths and that our
struggles bring up the true heroes
within us without my inner polar
opposites and only an impoverished
version of who I can be us for you which
is please remember that us twins are not
an either/or that there is no one where
an answer to which one of you is love
and then we don&#39;t become the fighting
type because we practicode otherwise
going because we decided to study for a
test
we&#39;re both and just like the rest of you
and we need our inner polarities that
makes us so unjustly human this reminds
me of the old Cherokee legend my mother
tell us when we were younger and
sometimes she still does especially on
the days when we get into our usual
sibling fights but you know how things
go so I&#39;ll spare you the lecture and
give you the short version a grandfather
is talking to his grandson about when we
all have two roles within us who are
always at war with each other one is the
Google who represents things like
happiness love and bravery the other
wolf is the battle who represents things
like anger hatred and fear
depends on thinks about this for a
moment before
third color which will ruin the
grandmother simply requires the one who
feed thank you
