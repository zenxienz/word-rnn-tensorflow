did anyone ever tell you at any point in
your career just do what you love I hate
that advice when I was a little girl my
parents told me I could be anything I
wanted to be the world was my oyster you
can do anything you set your mind to
Jody I was given all of the right
messaging and words of support from
someone coming from a family with means
and access and education but there was
another story I was privy to I&#39;ll never
forget my dad talking about his older
brother in a way of longing and envy on
some level about the fact that he loved
what he did they grew up in Brooklyn
in the 1950s playing stickball and
burying the detention book so they
wouldn&#39;t get kicked out of school and my
uncle Murray was kind of an anomaly and
that he loved riding horses and playing
polo which was totally outside of the
norm of the kids they paled around with
back then but he ultimately grew up to
study medicine become a veterinarian and
raised his family on a farm in
Pennsylvania doing what he loved for the
entirety of his career and my dad used
to say this he&#39;d say what a gift Jody
what a gift to know what you love and to
do what you love and so when I started
out in my early twenties in my career I
went looking for love in all the wrong
places
of course right first I chased adventure
as a Peace Corps volunteer in Latin
America then I chased impact I did
policy in government and nonprofit from
there I got my MBA and finally I chased
money I became an investment banker and
after a decade of searching
at 32 years old I was no closer to
finding work that I loved then I had
been when I started out and I was
totally crushed I was devastated
what was wrong with me I didn&#39;t love
anything well it turns out I was not
alone in my misery I was not an outlier
my uncle Murray was only 32 percent of
employees in the United States are
engaged at work only 32 percent gala
which is the world&#39;s leading
organization that looks at workforce
trends studies employee engagement and
they define engagement as this engaged
employees are those who are involved in
enthusiastic about and committed to
their work and their workplace which is
a noble cause for sure but says nothing
about purpose or meaning dare I say love
which leads us to where we are today as
a society we are collectively barking up
the wrong tree instead of spending our
lives looking for work we love which is
so elusive depressing and unattainable
for so many of us we need to make a
shift in our mindset the real goal the
real focus should be this make people
love you in a totally professional
putana quirk appropriate no one is
getting sued kind of way for real right
totally
right but if you make people love you
you will be successful you will be
challenged you will engage you will be
have impact and influence if I love you
I will pay you well I will promote you I
will mentor you I will sponsor you
purpose meaning opportunity and
sment they will find you as the CEO of a
leadership development firm I spend my
life shelling out career advice and my
job today is to build the bench of next
generation talent in this country and
instead of telling young people go find
work you love we teach them how to be
loved and this is what we know to be
true what we see across industries
across sectors across roles from the
highest level CEO to the newest hire
whether you are working the checkout
line at Target or you are doing data
analysis for Deloitte the way you make
me love you is by embodying four key
themes generosity initiative Ford
momentum and transparency they are a
gift not the gift of knowing what you
love and doing what you love but the
gift of making people love you
generosity it&#39;s not about being
philanthropic or charitable generosity
is walking in every day and sharing your
time your energy your talent your
network make introductions among people
it&#39;s about sharing credit giving props
to your team generosity at its core is
walking in every day and asking yourself
this one question how can I make my
team&#39;s life better or easier how can I
make my boss&#39;s life better or easier
think of someone right now at work who
makes your life better or easier what
would you do for that person
anything and everything initiative let
me tell you the story of an intern named
Josh who showed up for an interview on
Wall Street in sweatpants
poor guy for real airline lost his
luggage right and he got the job you
have some mad skills to get hired in
sweatpants in Wall Street so Josh goes
through his summer and he does a great
job and he&#39;s a really good guy and
everyone likes him and he&#39;s a good
cultural fit and at the end of the
summer as the team is going around
figuring out who&#39;s getting offers the
first VP speaks up and says Josh is a
really good guy I like him I think he
worked hard but you know what I didn&#39;t
have anything challenging for him I
don&#39;t know if he can cut it next VP
speaks up like Josh good guy it was all
client service it wasn&#39;t anything
technical it wasn&#39;t financial I don&#39;t
know if he can do the job and one by one
by one everyone went around the room
with the same analysis Josh didn&#39;t get
the job he didn&#39;t know he was supposed
to raise his hand take initiative and
ask for the work he wanted and needed
not just take the work that was given to
him Ford momentum it&#39;s all about moving
the ball forward always wins less time
you walked into the office you finished
some big initiative or a project you
worked really hard and you gave it to
your boss and your boss said thank you
so much why don&#39;t you take the rest of
the day off right
never never that has never happened your
boss said thank you so much what&#39;s next
that&#39;s why she&#39;s the boss because she&#39;s
always thinking two steps ahead which is
where you need to be always and finally
transparency as Murphy said if anything
can go wrong it will you will drop the
ball you will screw up you will miss a
deadline what matters is that you own up
to it you learn from that mistake you
are transparent when you see a problem
coming down the pipeline Sara Blakely
founder and CEO of Spanx youngest
self-made billionaire in this country
female she talks about the early lessons
from her father
about the fact that he called the
learnings in her
stakes and her failures hidden gifts and
she cultivates a culture of transparency
at Spanx today by encouraging her team
to bring their failures to the forefront
they call them the oops moments of
spanks generosity initiative for
momentum transparency that is how you
make people love you at work and the
best news is its 100% in your control to
do that I&#39;ll leave you with this one
last final thought I always get a little
bit uncomfortable when I hear grown-ups
ask little children what they want to be
when they grow up and you hear astronaut
or ballerina or Supreme Court justice
and I don&#39;t know about you but I do not
know any astronauts or ballerinas or
Supreme Court justices and by the same
token I have never met a six-year-old
who says I want to be a recruiting
manager when I grow up so what if we
change the conversation what if instead
of telling our children to go find work
they love we taught them how to make
people love them thank you
