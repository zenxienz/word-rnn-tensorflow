we&#39;ve all heard the story the story of
the Emperor and his new clothes started
off simple enough he just wanted to get
himself a fine new outfit he liked
clothes and it was gonna be so great he
would hire the best tailor and he was
gonna look so good he&#39;d throw a parade
so everybody could come and see there&#39;s
nothing wrong with any of that but as we
well know there was a problem and that
problem came with his deep-seated ego
attachment to that idea it put blinders
on him so it was the only thing he could
see that left him right for exploitation
which is exactly what happened because
Along Came the tailor and he managed to
tap into that ego attachment and he sold
him a very expensive invisible outfit
but again the emperor was blind to what
was the obvious so he put that outfit on
and he went on the parade so he&#39;s going
along gone along on that parade and it
wasn&#39;t until the moment that someone in
the audience in this case it was a child
a child who didn&#39;t have any preconceived
ideas so therefore he wasn&#39;t wearing any
blinders he was able to see the obvious
and he said so he pointed out to
everyone guys he&#39;s not wearing anything
and bam
then the blinders came off how
embarrassing
but of course he did a lot worse than
just embarrass himself because remember
that was an expensive invisible outfit
he taxed his people in excess to pay for
it he didn&#39;t set out to do harm he
didn&#39;t mean to harm anyone but he did
indeed do harm simply because he wasn&#39;t
open to new ideas we come to events like
this specifically because we want new
ideas we know we could encounter
something here today that could change
our lives forever
for the better and that is extraordinary
but how ready are we any one of us at
any moment in our day-to-day lives
because there is a built-in problem
we have to rely on our ideas we have a
pretty good idea how to do our job or
drive our car we have a pretty good idea
how to grocery shop if we questioned
every single little nuance of every
single idea we wouldn&#39;t be able to
function but there&#39;s something more
insidious than that and that is when
we&#39;re attached to our ideas we get a
nice little reward we get to feel safe
and we get to feel right that&#39;s kind of
nice well a new understanding of this
came home to me
not too long ago in a way I never would
have anticipated you see my husband and
I have been married a long time we
actually get along we&#39;re BFFs well we&#39;re
doing the happily ever after thing we&#39;re
cruising along in life mind in our own
beeswax and then he got a diagnosis of
stage four cancer we had ideas about
cancer before the diagnosis wait really
healthy we were reasonably active pretty
low stress he didn&#39;t have any really bad
habits that would raise any red flags in
the pantheon of things to worry about
cancer wasn&#39;t real high on our list and
we had ideas after the diagnosis as well
more ideas about nutrition and health
and ideas about treatment and now we had
to figure out what to do because what
they say is true cancer sucks
and it is scary it is so scary and it&#39;s
not just scary for the person it&#39;s
happening to because they don&#39;t live in
a bubble it&#39;s scary for everyone who
loves them everyone who cares about them
everyone in their family everyone of
their friends everyone who works with
them everyone who&#39;s mortal so you
remember how I said that our ideas our
attachment to our ideas can make us feel
safe well hold on to that because there
was a little something I learned a
little something I did not know it turns
out there are a fair number of people
who know the cure to cancer usually was
one simple household ingredient you know
how they know
yeah they saw it on the internet now I&#39;m
not actually talking about whether they
were right or whether they were wrong
whether they had any valid points or not
what I am talking about is where the
problem comes in it&#39;s the same with that
Emperor
it&#39;s that deep-seated ego attachment to
that idea because they were scared and
they wanted to feel safe and in order to
feel safe they had to believe in these
ideas they had to be right and you know
what when you have to be right there&#39;s a
reasonably good chance someone else has
to be wrong yeah yeah they let us know
it he had cancer because of something he
didn&#39;t eat enough of or something he ate
too much of or something he did in his
past or something he didn&#39;t do enough of
the point is it was a little bit on him
and they didn&#39;t have cancer because they
were too savvy to get it now you can see
first of all that&#39;s dangerous thinking
but that&#39;s Emperor thinking I am talking
about people who intended to be helpful
their intention was to help us but
instead because of that ego attachment
to that idea what it had what happened
was they tried to micromanage us in
order for them to feel a little bit
safer and again this is people who
intended to help us but fear not because
we know a lot of people and we know a
lot more people who are far more like
the child and you know how it is you
know when you are down there are so many
people that will help you and I could
stand up here all day and talk about
amazing people that really made a
difference in our lives
but they won&#39;t let me have the stage all
day so I&#39;m gonna give you one brief
shining example of some of my friends
who weren&#39;t like the Emperor they were
much more like the child they didn&#39;t
think they already knew everything and
therefore they weren&#39;t wearing blinders
and they were able to make a difference
so the example I&#39;m thinking of it
happened when we were heading into the
worst part of the treatments and again
cancer sucks and the treatments
and my husband had gone from living his
day-to-day life to at that point pretty
much living in his recliner and then
recurrently recliner broke I didn&#39;t need
somebody to tell me what to do
I knew the solution of this problem but
I did need a friend because I was upset
I wanted to complain so that&#39;s what I
did
I complained to my friends they knew
that&#39;s what I wanted they listened to me
but they also because they weren&#39;t
wearing blinders were able to see a very
obvious problem and that is that
something that normally would be a minor
inconvenience at any other time at this
stage of the game was kind of a big deal
so you know what they did so they went
out and found a new recliner
they didn&#39;t even presume at this point
they asked as if this was okay and it
was okay they bought the recliner they
brought it to our house they set it up
in the living room they took away the
old recliner they solved the problem for
us when we were at a moment in our lives
where we were in a sea of problems they
just took one of those problems away and
then you know what they said they said
it was no big deal
it was a big deal because they weren&#39;t
wearing blinders they were able to see
the obvious and make a difference at
this point I do want to digress for a
minute because I can tell that you are
lovely people and you&#39;re gonna care it
has been a year and a half since my
husband&#39;s last treatment and he has
recovered from those treatments he&#39;s
back to work he&#39;s feeling good and
here&#39;s the cherry on top there&#39;s no sign
of the tumor that caused that diagnosis
yes thank you thank you that is how I
feel and the obvious takeaway from all
of this it&#39;s his health he gets to be
better and we get more happily ever
after
life has a way of giving you a little
lessons along the journey whether you
feel like it or not so here&#39;s my
secondary takeaway this is what I want
to know when am I being more like the
Emperor and why am I being more like the
child it turns out it&#39;s fairly easy to
know we do need some introspection and
we do need to be honest with ourselves
but we can simply ask am i hearing am i
listening and paying attention more than
I&#39;m telling because new ideas and new
understanding tend to come better this
way then this way and what if more of us
were open to the idea that we need new
ideas we can&#39;t solve our problems by
doing the exact same things that got us
into them in the first place we need new
ideas and when we&#39;re doing this more
than this we&#39;re able to start to
understand each other we can understand
people of different cultures different
religions different backgrounds
different ideas and belief systems
different politics we need new ideas
because it is never ever us and then it
is always only ever just us so I propose
this then instead of holding on so
tightly to our own Emperor&#39;s garments
which we know are nothing more than our
imagination anyway what if we open up to
the idea that we need new ideas and this
is the question I believe we should be
asking and this is the question that I
will endeavour to ask from here on out
what are you saying
that I&#39;m not hearing because when our
friends are talking they just want to be
heard when protesters are demonstrating
they want to be heard politicians want
to be heard we don&#39;t have to agree we
don&#39;t have to
but what if we understood each other
because then we could really be open to
new ideas we could be ready to take off
those blinders and see the ideas that
might be right in front of us at this
very moment so imagine this imagine a
new kind of Emperor one who isn&#39;t stuck
in his ideas but he&#39;s open to new ideas
this is a man who could look out into
his kingdom and see what his people
really need is their suffering is their
hunger as they&#39;re want he could see it
and he might not have all of the perfect
ideas but he certainly would be in a
better position to come up with them and
he&#39;d be in a better position to hear
those people around him and who knows
where that ripple effect might end
because when he was stuck in his ego
ideas it was all about him but when he
opened up to new ideas this is a man who
could change the world and when we open
up to new ideas we can remove our
blinders and we could change the world
too so what do you say my friends let&#39;s
go change the world
