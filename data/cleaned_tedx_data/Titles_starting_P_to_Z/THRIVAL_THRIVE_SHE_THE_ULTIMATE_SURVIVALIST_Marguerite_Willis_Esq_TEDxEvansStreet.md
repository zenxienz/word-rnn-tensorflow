good afternoon the word for today is
thrival in life
you&#39;re either a survivor or you&#39;re
thriver there&#39;s survival and then
there&#39;s thrival and my idea worth
spreading is thrival ladies and
gentlemen the world as we know it may be
coming to an end
don&#39;t worry not today and maybe not
tomorrow but as we speak thousands of
Americans are prepping for disasters
ranging from nuclear war to invasions by
Martians now that all these folks
anymore are little old men wearing tin
hats some of these survivalists are coal
miners in Kentucky who are digging
bunkers in their backyards and their
tech billionaires in Silicon Valley who
are buying condominiums in bomb-proof
silos in Kansas but rich or poor they
all have one objective they&#39;re going to
survive with their families unless when
the day of doom arrives they have some
rules for this and some of their rules
of survival or prepping are these one
carry cash because on the day that the S
hits the fan as they like to say they&#39;ll
be no banks number to put up food and
other provisions because on that day
there will be no grocery stores and
number three hide your identity why
because on the day of destruction your
enemies will come looking for you and
your cash and your food okay I get it
the world is a dangerous place terrorism
cyber threats identity theft
I understand I think we all understand
the natural urge the natural desire to
protect ourselves in our pain
emily&#39;s this is an example of what is
called an EDC and everyday carry the
survivalist carry these with them at all
times and they contain some water and
some food and a first-aid kit not a bad
idea I&#39;d say I think I&#39;m going to put
this one in the back of my car but long
before the current Preppers we&#39;re
getting ready for the day of doom
there were other survivalists in this
country there were people who hid money
in their pockets and buried coins in
their yards they found food and they put
it up for hard times and they kept
themselves small and quiet bless someone
stronger put them in their place either
emotionally or worse physically and who
were those brave Preppers those original
survivors ladies and gentlemen
they were the women
we have done more as it were any other
folks in this country we have done more
with less statistics tell us that will
will live 10 years longer on average
than our husbands and our brothers but
we will make 20% less for the same work
and it took us a hundred and fifty years
almost to convince this country that we
love to give us the vote how about that
talk about being a survivalist right and
oh by the way remember mom&#39;s pocketbook
this EDC is just an amped-up version of
what everyone saw on their mother&#39;s arm
which always had a juice box a band-aid
and a bag of Cheerios what the Preppers
are learning though and what women have
known all along is that survival is
tough business every day you have to get
up and provide for your family and every
night you have to sleep with one eye
open thinking about what terror may
befall you the next day and if there is
a face of survival in this country it&#39;s
the face of a single mother with
school-aged children who cannot afford
day care to that woman the loss of the
power grid that the prepper is fear so
greatly is not nearly as scary as the
fact that next month she may not be able
to pay her electrical bill an identity
theft or to that single mom it almost
might be a relief a new identity might
be a better life for her so I think it&#39;s
fair to say that the women of America a
lot of them are simply tired of merely
surviving they are anxious to get to
what I call thrival so
what we&#39;re going to do today is we&#39;re
going to take three rules of survival
and turn them into three rules of
thrival here we go all right
first rule carry cash ladies if you hear
nothing else from me today hear this
money all things considered is power you
need your own money your own separate
money my grandmother inherited money and
she used to call it her independence I
never really understood that until I
made my own money and having my own
separate money allowed me to escape an
abusive relationship and on two
occasions it allowed me to tell a boss
listen buddy if you don&#39;t change your
ways you can take this job and shove it
you know what he knew that I was serious
and why because I had my own money I
could leave I had some independence so
whether you work outside of the home or
not
remember this you need your own separate
funds number to put up provisions for
the future ladies we got this one
covered three words double coupon day
every woman knows that when the peanut
butter is on sale you stock up enough
said number three this third rule of
survival is to hide your identity ladies
for too long we have been too small we
need to open ourselves up we&#39;ve got to
stand up we&#39;ve got to speak up and we&#39;ve
got to vote up I said earlier that we
make less money than men over our
lifetime you know much it is on average
is almost a half a million dollars that
we don&#39;t earn for the same job why is
that
studies show in part it&#39;s because women
don&#39;t advocate for their value in the
workplace well we got to stop that we
have to speak up and when we speak up we
have to find others who will speak up to
as our advocates we have to look for
politicians for political candidates who
will support the three pillars of
tribalism for women equal rights equal
pay and reproductive freedom now what I
mean by that is simply this we should
have the right to decide when we have
children and how many because if we
don&#39;t have that right if we don&#39;t have
that independence we can never really be
economically independent in the last
presidential election almost 46% of the
qualified voters in this country did not
vote think about that what if all the
women got together and decided they were
going to champion candidates that could
move them from survival into thrival
ladies there&#39;s only one place in America
today where you&#39;re absolutely equal to a
man and that is in the voting booth your
vote no matter how poor you are counts
just as much as the vote of Bill Gates
the wealthiest man in America so you
need to vote up now folks are going to
say to you when you stand up and you
speak up in your boat up what are you
doing
how dare you and what you say is this I
don&#39;t want what you have I&#39;m not looking
to take anything away from you I just
want what I deserve
ladies and gentlemen there&#39;s only one
thing wrong with what I&#39;ve said today I
fear that the women who could get the
most from this message will not hear it
they&#39;re simply too busy surviving to
take time to listen to a podcast or to
watch a youtube video but you know what
you and I are here together today and
maybe just maybe this message is meant
for one of you so for those of you who
are in a position where you&#39;re thriving
I ask you to consider this think about
looking back over your shoulder and
reaching out your hand for someone who
is struggling to survive and if you are
someone
who hasn&#39;t reached thrival yet if you&#39;re
struggling I ask you to look for that
hand and grab it when it comes along you
see thrival isn&#39;t just a word I made up
it&#39;s actually something I believe in as
a way of life thrival that&#39;s my idea
worth sharing thank you
[Applause]
