over the last decade junk food has taken
a real beating in the public eye
McDonald&#39;s has shut down hundreds of its
stores organic food shops are popping up
everywhere we&#39;ve awoken to the fact that
junk food hurts us it&#39;s time for a
similar revolution in our news
consumption because junk news hurts this
too and I don&#39;t mean fake news fake news
is intentionally fake junk news is true
or at least attempts to be we all
instinctively know what I&#39;m talking
about right but it turns out that the
term junk food news was actually coined
in the 1980s by this guy a
communications professor in California
and dr. Carl Jensen defined junk news as
the nonsense that distracts us from the
more important issues the gossip the sex
and celebrity news the latest fads but
I&#39;d like to venture that junk news and
its spectrum is actually wider than that
it also includes sloppy journalism about
actual important news journalism that&#39;s
opinionated superficial one-sided that
isn&#39;t an outright lie the way fake news
is but that doesn&#39;t help us understand
very much and is poor quality
so if classical junk news is your greasy
double bacon cheeseburger junk coverage
of important news is the low-fat
blueberry muffin that looks healthy but
it&#39;s actually loaded with calories
the thing is junk news is actually more
dangerous than fake news because it&#39;s
more insidious and here&#39;s how the world
today is a complex mess hit by an
outbreak of the Ebola virus by the
militant group Isis by the conflict in
Syria another war in Libya Afghanistan
South Sudan Congo revolutions disasters
wars the list goes on and on
direct hits by an asteroid we are
bombarded by bad news every day and a
lot of what we hear about the threats
that face us is somewhere on that junk
new spectrum I&#39;ve been a journalist
covering humanitarian crises for the
last 10 years crises that threaten
people&#39;s lives their safety their access
to basic services and I now run a news
organization called Aaron that
specializes in covering some of the
biggest challenges of our time migration
climate change wars and epidemics from
hotspots around the world our
journalists try to dig deeper to go
beyond the headlines
to explore in depth the implications the
causes and the responses to crises and
to try to encourage more effective
international policymaking from that
vantage point I can tell you that a lot
of the news that we hear today about
these crises doesn&#39;t even begin to
scratch the surface so let me give you a
couple examples in 2007 I arrived in
Sudan just as the chief prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court was
seeking an arrest warrant for the
Sudanese president he alleged that the
President had committed war crimes in
Sudan&#39;s Western Darfur province
now I&#39;d heard a lot about Darfur in my
home country of Canada in the West we
were told that a brutal genocide was
underway that the Arabs were trying to
wipe out certain African tribes because
of their ethnicity ethnic cleansing and
tribal fighting dominated headlines and
gave birth to a movement to try to stop
a genocide George Clooney and Bono among
others took up the mantle and all this
sounds positive but the problem is that
they repeated these simplistic ethnic
driven narratives over and over when I
went to Sudan to find out for myself
these narratives began to disentangle
the ethnic distinctions weren&#39;t so clear
one of the people I met in a small
village in the north of the country was
Adam abbess Ibrahim and I remember
asking him are you Arab or African and
he seemed a bit puzzled by the question
and eventually he said both so I guess
he came from the four tribe one of the
main tribes in Darfur but also had Arab
blood he&#39;d married an Arab boy
and together they had three mix children
and I learned that the two groups had
intermingled in Darfur for decades you
see the conflict in Darfur was a
complicated mix of factors first you had
a struggle for power federally between
the elite in the capital and those on
the periphery who wanted political
reform in Darfur you had a split between
the nomads and the farmers who had
historically shared land and water but
because of a drought were increasingly
competing over resources and then you
had a government that capitalized on
these divisions for its own interests
now I&#39;ve only just given you the tip of
the iceberg but the point is it&#39;s
complicated more complicated than the
words ethnic cleansing alone can reflect
simplistic narratives in Sudan led to
policies that the people on the ground
didn&#39;t really need it also made it
nearly impossible to have a constructive
conversation with the Sudanese
government and that hampered prospects
for peace let me give you another
example in Syria in the early days of
the war the narrative was simple Syrian
President Bashar al-assad was bad and
the rebels trying to oust him from power
were good many Western leaders were
pushing for these rebels to be armed so
that they could fight this evil dictator
but over time the complexity became
apparent the rebels were a vast mix of
groups including some extremist groups
who weren&#39;t so innocent in the capital
Damascus in 2012 I met a young man named
Khalid let&#39;s call him offended in a
middle-class home where he and his
mother were busy preparing lists of
people in aid in need of aid and
deliveries and he&#39;d been presented to me
as a local volunteer helping the relief
effort but it wasn&#39;t long before he
admitted to me that when there wasn&#39;t
enough money to fund his relief work he
picked up his gun went back to his
hometown of Homs and hijacked aid
convoys at gunpoint to redistribute the
aid to those he felt were most in need
Khalid was just one of the many complex
characters that I met in Syria but he
encapsulate the challenge when you&#39;re
trying to resolve the Syrian conflict
who are the good guys
who are the bad guys
with salad a freedom fighter an aid
worker or a dangerous militant it just
isn&#39;t black and white like Sudan in the
case of Syria simplistic narratives
about who to blame have completely
warped our view of the conflict have
affected military realities on the
ground and have led to stagnation in the
peace negotiations Sudan and Syria are
just two in a long list of crises that
defy simplistic narratives and yet much
of what we consume about them today is
exactly that so you might say so what I
don&#39;t need to know the intricacies of
some crisis on the other side of the
world here&#39;s why that thinking is flawed
first we live in an interconnected world
crises somewhere else will land on our
doorstep sooner or later the conflict in
Syria has caused a global refugee exodus
it has fueled the rise of right-wing
politicians in many countries and it has
threatened the entire concept of the
European Union next door in Iraq the
invasion of 2003 by the u.s. spawned the
birth of Isis which has gone on to
terrorize the entire world these crises
cannot be contained and building a wall
as some simplistic narratives might
suggest will not protect us the second
reason we need to understand these
crises is this every year the United
Nations spends billions of dollars
responding to crises that money mostly
comes from governments which means it
comes from us as taxpayers don&#39;t we want
to know how it&#39;s spent whether it&#39;s used
effectively whether it&#39;s actually
achieved anything and third and most
importantly we share a common humanity
we live at a time of rising suffering
more and more communities are being
pushed to the edge as a result of
climate change
urbanization sectarianism the list goes
on ten years ago the UN was targeting 26
million people with emergency
life-saving aid in crisis zones today
that number has nearly quadrupled to 98
million people that&#39;s well over the
population of France
can you imagine every single person in
this country struggling for the very
basics of life food
water shelter safety we&#39;re talking about
people who go to bed at night wondering
if their children will be kidnapped by
militias the next morning women in
refugee camps who worry about going to
the bathroom for fear of being raped
along the way parents who have to decide
whether to give the only lifejacket to
their son or their daughter as they
board a shaky boat to cross the
Mediterranean that could be me and that
could be you it has never been more
important to understand our ever complex
world because we cannot prevent respond
to or resolve these crises if we do not
properly understand them but there&#39;s
another angle to this my grandmother
used to say that no right is lost so
long as someone is fighting for it and I
think that&#39;s part of the reason I became
a journalist part of fighting for those
rights is having a free independent
press that can amplify the voices of the
most marginalized in society that can
ask the tough questions that can hold
the powerful to account so this isn&#39;t
just about a failure to understand the
world around us junk news erodes our
democracies because it fails to give us
the information we need to be
responsible active citizens and to make
informed decisions about our own lives
so no matter how you slice it the stakes
are really high biased information
superficial reporting TV hosts who are
spouting off their opinions without any
evidence this leads to dangerous public
perceptions and bad international
policies think of the debates around
climate change migration brexit the u.s.
elections on these key issues of our
time simplistic populist messages are
winning on top of that we live in a
social media age where nuance and reason
don&#39;t always go viral it is getting
harder and harder for responsible
informed journalism to break through all
the noise out there as far as I&#39;m
concerned this is the challenge of our
time it&#39;s a real dilemma for news
organizations like ours because we&#39;re
out there producing this quality
in-depth journalism about life-and-death
issues and we struggle sometimes to get
it to resonate until we simplify it and
dress it up until it risks losing its
value like
hiring a healthy salad and then
smothering it with ranch dressing so why
is there so much junk news out there
well for the same reason there&#39;s a lot
of junk food what&#39;s in the public
interest is not always what the public
is interested in nonsense is cheaper and
easier to produce and it sells better
CNN&#39;s senior international correspondent
is busy reporting about Kim Kardashian
while in places like Sudan Western
correspondents are becoming rarer and
rarer six correspondents to communicate
what&#39;s happening in Sudan to the entire
Western world Western media coverage of
international affairs has been declining
steadily for decades and yet at last
count there were 3.2 million articles
about the fact that Donald Trump
invented a word confetti however you
pronounce it 3.2 million so that&#39;s on us
in the media industry but part of this
is on all of us as consumers it&#39;s an
overwhelming world out there I get that
okay but simplistic narratives
perpetuate in part because we allow them
to because we buy into them we&#39;ve gotten
used to being entertained rather than
informed now a cat video here a mummy
there you know we all need a dose of
distraction from time to time but we
don&#39;t eat junk food every day so my
appeal to you is this let&#39;s push back
against the received wisdoms the lazy
assumptions the cliches
let&#39;s stop eating junk news it&#39;s making
us sick and miserable and it&#39;s not doing
much good for the world either there is
a better healthier menu out there of
rich mouth-watering stuff you know when
you go to the restaurant and the chef
has taken his time to carefully plate
every course and every bite is perfectly
seasoned that my friends is the tricky
messy more elusive stuff of truth in all
of its nuance and complexity despite the
challenges that the media industry faces
today the fake news the social media
digital transformation there are some of
us out there fighting the good fight
solid reliable journalism does exist you
just have to seek it out and consume it
and where possible support the
journalists producing it
as we have to pay more for nutritious
food we should be prepared to pay for
quality news and just as you check the
label at the back for the calorie
content let&#39;s start asking ourselves
whether the news we consume is good for
our minds so consider this an invitation
to start looking after ourselves a
little bit better and in so doing to
help look after the world just like the
junk food revolution we were likely to
land on the right side of history as the
American scholar Edward Wilson put it we
are drowning in information while
starving for wisdom the world will be
run by people able to put together the
right information at the right time
think critically about it and make
important choices wisely as global
citizens if we are informed we can be
part of shaping the decisions that shape
our world we can put pressure on our
governments to act and we can mobilize
only when we properly understand our
complex world can we begin to change it
for the better and I promise you when
you&#39;ve eaten at the Michelin star
restaurant the junk food just doesn&#39;t
taste as good anymore thank you
[Applause]
you
