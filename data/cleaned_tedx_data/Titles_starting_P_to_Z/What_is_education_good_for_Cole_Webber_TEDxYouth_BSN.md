I&#39;ve been studying education for the
past six years from a rather unique
perspective I&#39;m 18 and I still go to
school and when I was 12 my friends and
I became very disengaged we just thought
that there must be more we could learn
we&#39;re spurred us on to enter a big
international competition with 700
entries and over 3,000 participants from
a few continents to design a school of
the future now the guidelines of this
competition mostly focused on a school
building so questions like how can we
design more energy-efficient classrooms
and you could design your school for any
type of a future that you wanted so it
could look like something out of science
fiction movie set 50 years from now but
we wanted to examine how we were
learning today we wanted to come up with
an actual solution and so we chose a
future that was a lot closer to home we
set the opening date of our school to be
five years from when we started with a
realistic budget and before we designed
the building we started by designing the
learning process itself then we ended up
winning the entire competition but was
really interesting to us was the
feedback we were getting from our jury
members they said that what they found
unique about our project was that we had
focused on learning processes that could
take place anywhere not just in the
school built out of carbon nanotubes and
equipped with holodecks if they got the
if we got the right people they told us
maybe we could actually do it so we
thought how can we get the right people
we contacted the government of our
province of Alberta not really thinking
that we would hear anything back but to
our surprise we met with everyone we
would need to make our vision a reality
the premier minister of education
infrastructure intergovernmental affairs
all came to meet with in
twelve-year-olds and since then I&#39;ve had
the opportunity to go around Canada and
work with other governments and school
boards I&#39;ve also had the incredible
opportunities to help design 23 actual
schools and to work with international
organisations and businesses in North
America and Europe I&#39;d like to use some
of that experience to talk to you about
your education so why do you go to
school I think it&#39;ll be apparent to
everyone that we go to school to get
knowledge the teachers give us
information people formulas dates we
learn them then we get tested on them at
the end of this process your head is
just crammed full of all of this
knowledge but is it really
the problem is that knowledge is not
necessarily cumulative how many of you
could score the same amount test that
you took five years ago over some of the
adults in the room fifteen years ago I
have a little test of my own for you I
tried to pick something that everybody
should have gone over at one point in
their schooling so what is the atomic
mass of nitrogen I&#39;ll give you a big
hint it&#39;s one of the numbers on that
symbol okay it&#39;s this one now I gave
this to some adults before I came and
even some the ones that got it right
said they weren&#39;t sure so if you did get
it right why don&#39;t you tell me where all
the other numbers mean no I&#39;m just
kidding you can still pass so the point
is that you may have known this at some
time but you may have forgotten but it&#39;s
mattering less and less if you can
remember these specific details because
we&#39;re currently living in a world where
we&#39;re surrounded by knowledge we&#39;re
living through the largest change in the
way that people deal with information
since the advent of written language
five thousand years ago in all of that
time if you wanted to look up a piece of
information use them you were limited to
what information was kept where you
should only carry books of a certain
size around with you and so if you
wanted to use a piece of information
instantaneously out with you wherever
you were in the world it was better to
at least try to memorize it even though
you could forget it but now if you know
that a piece of information exists but
you can&#39;t quite recall what it was
you can instantaneously find it from
almost any location mobile devices can
expand the amount of information that
you can use beyond what you have
memorized in other words it&#39;s okay that
you&#39;ve forgotten rather than build up a
static knowledge trying to cram all
these facts into our heads it&#39;s much
more important now that we have an
adaptive knowledge and what I mean by
that is we just need to know we&#39;re going
to use when we&#39;re going to use it
because in a world with information
everywhere the demand isn&#39;t for people
who can cram a bunch in their head is
for people who can take the information
that&#39;s all around them and do something
with it and we don&#39;t have a tremendous
capacity to do just this I mentioned
that our school of the future project
required us to come up with energy
efficiency solutions the site that we
selected for our school was very close
to an ice hockey arena and our course of
researching we found out that the
refrigeration equipment for these arenas
produces a huge amount of waste heat
that it&#39;s actually quite common to use
this heat to warm other buildings in the
wintertime but we were wondering what if
we could use the waste from this
facility
to cool our building in the summer as
well I used to live across from one of
these arenas and when they cleaned off
the ice surface they would scrape the
excess ice into a big pile there was so
much ice that it would still be melting
well into the spring months so we said
what if he was scraped instead into an
insulated trench with pipes running
through it that were connected to your
school&#39;s air conditioning system we
showed her idea to a sustainability
expert who said that she was knowledge
it had never been attempted before
but he did some research and came back
and told us that it would work if we
used a specific chemical in the pipes
now at the age of 12 we were coming up
with solutions to real-world problems
just using the information around us and
this is becoming really important in a
recent poll 90% of businesses described
innovation as essential to their
operation in a survey last year of over
76 million job postings - quite a
comprehensive survey found the two most
in-demand attributes in the world are
number one oral in written communication
and number two problem-solving so this
would seem great we may not remember as
well as we think we do but we just need
to take some of the information that&#39;s
now all around us and integrated to do
something the problem is that we&#39;re not
getting people who can do this in a
recent survey seventy-five percent of
businesses said that graduates were
specifically ill-prepared in critical
thinking analytical reasoning written
and oral communication complex
problem-solving innovation creativity
and applying their knowledge and skills
to real-world settings so how do we go
about using information to do things and
how can we shape education to deal with
these new realities well when we were
going through the school of the future
project we noticed some interesting
things the first thing was about
ourselves now we had started that
project because we were disengaged and
bored and why was that it was because
all we were doing was practice we get a
worksheet we work on it it would go in
the recycling we get another one and
then start to forget about was on the
first one we were like a sports team
they kept practicing but never played a
single game but we were now seeing
firsthand that we could be applying this
information to do something solve actual
problems in the world now we talked with
that sustainability expert but he wasn&#39;t
the only one we talked to
we also talked with architects business
people people from the government
people from environmental protection
agencies of all the people who requested
a meeting with we never had a single
person decline no matter how expert or
busy they were and so we became really
interested by this and myself and some
other students side mat from across the
United States and Canada sort a
nonprofit organization which we called
the spark foundation to see if we could
connect these two things we thought what
if we could make projects that weren&#39;t
just practice they were solving actual
problems and students would work on
these in their classrooms and they would
be helped along the way their ideas
could be vetted by actual experts and it
didn&#39;t go exactly as we thought but we
learned some interesting things first of
all we had a tremendous response from
outside of the system better than we
expected in our first five months of
recruiting we got fifty four mentors
from five countries which included
architects businesspeople furniture
manufacturers we had a Canadian Member
of Parliament a seismologist
and one of the heads of were the largest
radio telescopes in the world when we
tried to get these actual problems into
classrooms we hit a wall
we found that quite often school boards
and teachers were hesitant to and state
what they saw as an add-on if they
didn&#39;t receive an extra qualification or
incentive for doing so so can the system
because can the government provide an
incentive well maybe it won&#39;t come fast
enough a few years ago I was invited to
help write educational policy in my
province of Alberta and when it became a
part of this committee the government
sent a package of materials to my house
for me to review and the first time I
went through it my jaw just about hit
the floor because the latest draft that
they had sent me which I confirmed was
the latest draft in existence was 19
years old which was three years older
than me at the time now in those 19
years we&#39;ve gone from the corded phone
to the smart phone we&#39;re experiencing a
fundamental change in the way that
people deal with information that
probably should have affected education
so it&#39;s not necessarily that there are
not people within the system who will
provide support or that there aren&#39;t
people trying from within the system but
I think by the time we see meaningful
change with that massive scale you&#39;re
going to be long graduated now we
noticed something else really
interesting through the spark foundation
which wasn&#39;t as obvious at the time
and that was just a simple observation
that we had the capacity the time to do
all of us I spent an enormous amount of
time working on these extra projects
when I was in high school I once missed
a continuous month of school going away
speaking and trying to get mentors and
to allow myself to do this I moved
around my education I took classes
online ahead of time I challenged exams
so I didn&#39;t have to be in a classroom
for as long when I graduated had credit
from three different schools in two
different divisions we had seen that
well the whole system is big and slow
and seemingly a moveable that the
individual inside of that big maze
actually has tremendous capacity to
modify it to suit their needs and so
that&#39;s why I&#39;m not talking to the
government or the school boards anymore
I&#39;m here talking directly to you because
maybe we don&#39;t have to change the whole
system to make an impact right now we
all have access to a profound amount of
information and also a means of creation
and distribution which means more so
than ever before you can build your own
education so how do we build an
education what are the important
building blocks
well the Sparx foundation we failed to
get our projects into classrooms like we
wanted to because we didn&#39;t recognize as
clearly as we needed to that there are
two pieces to education the first one is
the one that everybody thinks of
learning but the second one is just as
important you need something that shows
that process that demonstrates what you
can do as a result and that&#39;s a
qualification that we usually think of
qualifications as things like the
diplomas or the degrees that you get at
the end of your schooling but
increasingly these conventional
qualifications may not show people what
they want to know they may not indicate
that you can integrate the information
around you to create value now degrees
or qualifications but are all
qualifications degrees well let&#39;s think
about if we&#39;re going to invent something
if you&#39;re going to make an invention you
do research you&#39;d make some prototypes
you gather all this information together
into an application you file and if you
were successful you&#39;d get a patent which
shows the process it shows what you can
do and I would call that like an
irrefutable degree in inventing now this
is just one example of many things that
I think you&#39;ll find you have the
capability to get started on right now
you could make a product write a book
start an organisation
make an app make a film make a website
and these things aren&#39;t just practice
they matter they can affect the lives
around you and I think that if you
choose a problem that matters to you to
try to solve it&#39;s going to change the
way that you think about your life and
it might even reveal capacities that you
didn&#39;t even know you had a few years ago
Saskatchewan which is a province NL in
Canada was facing a large school
shortage and their solution was to
design a whole bunch of schools in one
sitting in a week-long process with all
the stakeholders involved and so I was
brought in to help facilitate student
engagement now on the first day of the
week all the students that were at the
event got together there were 12 of us
and we stood around in a circle just
going around and introducing ourselves
and as we went around the circle we came
to one girl when it was her turn she
just shook her head she wouldn&#39;t speak
now fast forward to the end of the week
we&#39;re in an enormous room we have our
preliminary models and sketches posted
up there&#39;s all the hundreds of people
that were at the event that are still
there but now there&#39;s also the Minister
of Education all of the higher-ups from
the government and there&#39;s also
reporters and television cameras lining
the back wall and who do you think is in
front of the entire scene sharing what
we came up with that week it was the
same girl at the beginning of the week
she couldn&#39;t talk to 11 other students
at the end she was literally sharing her
ideas with the world how was that amount
of growth possible in just a few days we
asked her in her exit interview and she
said that it was because it mattered
what she said wasn&#39;t just going to be
thrown in the recycling it was literally
going to affect the lives of tens of
thousands of students and these actual
outcomes they increasingly matter to
other people as well in a recent poll 71
percent of businesses said that they
would consider hiring someone without a
degree
/ someone with one but the really
important thing is that ninety-one
percent said that a demonstrated
capacity to think critically to
communicate clearly and to solve complex
problems is more important than a
candidate&#39;s undergraduate major people
are growing more receptive to these
actual outcomes as qualifications
because what better proof that you can
do something than if you&#39;ve already done
it so I challenge you to move around
your education to
find a problem that matters to you to
dive in and start trying to come up with
an actual solution right now now this
raises an important question what if you
fail what if you spend all this time and
you don&#39;t produce what you originally
wanted to well maybe you don&#39;t have to
in order to bring value all of the
things that I&#39;ve done have opened new
doors and if you&#39;ve been listening
carefully you&#39;ll see many of them failed
to achieve what we originally hoped they
would many times we decided to pivot
because as we work with a big
complicated messy actual problem you&#39;re
going to learn new things build up your
adaptive knowledge have new ideas and
insights and you&#39;re going to want to act
on those in the conventional idea of
Education we have an end point people
graduate we stay they&#39;re educated right
now we&#39;re all supposed to be in this
first part just practicing waiting for
the real stuff but I&#39;ve seen firsthand
that we&#39;re all capable of being out
there of actually affecting the world
around us and that in fact the best way
to affect the world around you is to
constantly be revising your solutions to
be using what you&#39;ve learned to make
your ideas better so we started by
wanting to build a school and then we
decided that policy could probably
affect more people so we decided to work
with the government in making policy and
then that wasn&#39;t working out so well so
we decided let&#39;s work outside the
government with the SPARC foundation to
try to get projects into classrooms and
then that didn&#39;t work out how we thought
it would but we saw the tremendous power
of the individual to change their own
education and now I&#39;m on a stage which
is literally 7,000 kilometers away from
where I started talking to you and my
point is even a failure to produce what
you originally thought you would can
still bring a large amount of value and
still produce a very valid qualification
because as long as you make something
that shows your learning process it will
also show your willingness to tackle new
problems and to have new ideas it will
show your growth and afterall is growth
not the goal of Education you can change
your education by doing things that
matter and I challenge you to start
coming up with actual solutions as part
of a continual process that lasts for
the rest of your life thank you
[Applause]
