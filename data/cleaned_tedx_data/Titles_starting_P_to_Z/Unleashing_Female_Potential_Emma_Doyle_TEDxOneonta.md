welcome to my world the world of sport
the world of tennis now sport has a
wonderful way of bringing people
together it can transcend boundaries of
race and religion in a way like no other
event on the planet most of the world
stops in breathless anticipation for
finals in major sporting events the
soccer world cup the Masters in golf
Wimbledon the Olympic Games the list
goes on it is arguably the great unifier
in the hearts and minds of millions of
people it allows us to play have fun yet
in a serious way now this is why I find
the great sport of tennis so fascinating
it&#39;s a problem-solving game and the ball
never bounces in the same way twice just
as in life no two decisions are ever the
same and when you&#39;re in a singles match
that you care deeply about and it&#39;s 5-4
in that final set it&#39;s often not the
player with the prettier technique that
wins but the person with the stronger
character the biggest heart
you are alone your character is exposed
and ultimately you are defined by the
results of your decisions and your
actions it is theater on a grand scale
in the words of William Shakespeare all
the world&#39;s a stage and all the men and
women are merely players well on this
world stage statistics tell us that
females make up forty nine point six
percent of the population yet in reality
there are far fewer females contributing
despite major advances in equal prize
money in tennis for both males and
females and the enormous efforts of
Billie Jean King defeating Bobby Riggs
in the battle of the sexes in 1973 the
simple facts are
here in the United States ESPN
SportsCenter devotes only 5% of its
coverage to women athletes in the United
Kingdom women account for just 10% of
sports journalists and in Australia
there are only 19% of qualified female
tennis coaches and would you believe
there are more CEOs named John than
there are female CEOs the scales of
justice are clearly out of balance in
relation to contributions of both males
and females and interestingly in junior
tennis 80% of unforced errors occur when
you are off balance and the other
revealing statistic in my home state is
that one in every two Victorian female
tennis players and no longer playing
tennis by the time they reach the late
teens the argument is clear we cannot
reach our potential as individuals as
societies unless we make use of the
talents of all the fact that we are not
making use of female energy is a massive
loss in sport and a huge loss for women
as leaders beyond tennis this energy is
being repressed it is being imprisoned
so what can we do about it
well when I returned home from playing
us college tennis with my degree in hand
I wanted to become the best tennis coach
that I could possibly be so what did I
do
I volunteered to coach at a Women&#39;s
youth detention center now you might be
thinking that&#39;s a little extreme okay
but I grew up in a household that really
encouraged stretching your comfort zone
so on that morning I arrived early
little bit nervous excited minor problem
as I was walking through security right
the guard found that I had one of these
our footwork ladders in the bottom of my
basket and you know despite
I&#39;m showing him all the benefits you
know that you could do to be like quick
on your toes and we&#39;ll be fair to say
probably not the best piece of equipment
to be taking into a woman&#39;s prison right
so anyway what I did is um you know I
proceeded to meticulously set up my
indoor tennis court as per my lesson
plan
suddenly a dozen high-energy females
walked into the room they picked up the
racquets and they began smashing the
balls in any and every direction it was
complete chaos there were balls flying
everywhere all of my senses were alert I
had to listen with my eyes I had no
choice and trust my instincts as I said
what everybody pick up a racket which of
course they already had and then I said
I want you to hit the ball as hard as
you can in any in every direction which
of course they were already doing and
then I just spent my time like trying to
spread them out to avoid a major
catastrophe or any injuries and then
after about five minutes I said okay
bring it in and to my amazement they did
they were now ready to accept me because
I had allowed them to express himself in
the only way that they knew how this
story is a great metaphor for the
imprisoned female energy and its urgent
need to express itself now I didn&#39;t
realize at the time just how valuable
this lesson was as a young coach and in
my quest for knowledge and growth I
continued to put myself in unfamiliar
situations asking myself the same
question over and over again so what
does make a great coach to me this is
the Holy Grail question of coaching at
the US Open a couple of years ago I put
this question to one of the best players
in the world
Roger Federer
he said someone who listens
then I asked one of the best tennis
coaches in the world in Judy Murray she
said someone who listens and then
earlier this year I asked Serena
Williams&#39;s coach Patrick Mouratoglou he
said someone who listens correct and
then he delved deeper and said you have
to be able to hear what the player is
thinking now this really validated my
own thoughts feelings and experiences
because when we listen really listen we
start to engage we begin to understand
the players map of the world the energy
PS that is guiding them and this is
particularly important when we&#39;re
dealing with female players because if
you can chin into their wavelength or
perhaps their Spotify playlist then you
have hope of building authentic trusting
relationships in fact listening is the
tipping point
so having tapped into this enormous
reserve of energy we have a
responsibility to harness its potential
how do we do this
what did great cultures do they use
empowering language because language
matters the words we choose the comments
we make whether consciously or
subconsciously impact the strength of
the player&#39;s private inner voice
especially under pressure and it&#39;s not
surprising that in the teenage years we
know from neuroscience that the brain is
undergoing intense and inevitable change
consequently the teenage years are
turbulent hypersensitive and emotionally
demanding and in my experience as the
Australian junior fed cup captain I
would often ask my young female players
who tell me what
your strengths they would go straight to
their perceived weaknesses struggled
with articulated air strength or look to
mom or dad or coach for the magic answer
and unfortunately all too often I hear
coaches focus on the past
after a negative match or an experience
and this serves only to reinforce
habitual patterns of negative thoughts
and I was guilty of this too when I was
a young coach instead girls want praise
where praise is due they want feedback
where feedback is due and great coaches
do this by observing the past focusing
on asking a future based question
returning to the present to deliver
execute and repeat let me let me share a
classic coaching example of this so
where rattling in cross court and all of
a sudden there&#39;s an error as I try to
change direction of the ball down the
line now if you ask a past base question
what happened there why&#39;d you miss that
ball she will give you a highly accurate
list of everything that went wrong oh
yeah well I made my decision later I
shifted my head I was off balance and
the list goes on however if you ask a
future based question next time you had
that same ball what are you going to do
differently what other options are
possible through repetition this will
empower her private inner voice and
really strengthen her with comments such
as next time I&#39;ll turn my shoulders next
time I&#39;ll be more on balance this serves
to strengthen the private inner voice
builds self-esteem allows for
accountability and enables the student
to find the strengths that live within
you see the words we choose impact and
mold the brains neuroplasticity they are
critical in building new brain Maps
especially in these teenage years and
let me share a story to illustrate this
so a student of the game comes to me and
she says can you look at my serve I said
sure it looks something like this okay
I&#39;ll show you that again
and she goes I know I know coach I know
what you&#39;re going to say you&#39;re going to
tell me that I&#39;ve got a hitch on my
serve
like I get stuck here right you&#39;re gonna
tell me that yeah many coaches have told
me this before well first of all I
thought well is that interesting years
of that negative reinforcement and I
just simply said what if you were to
spread your wings what if you just let
gravity do the work for you
just like gravity do the work for you
now little did I realize she had felt
stuck in a number of areas of her life
not necessarily related to tennis but it
was only on her terms through repetition
that she felt ready to let go all the
coaching experience did was provide an
environment to listen to engage through
using empowering language that enabled
the student to find the answers that
live within herself we have a golden
opportunity to begin to restore the
balance it is time to remove the
blindfold from Lady Justice so that we
all might hear and see clearly a way
forward I am in tennis I am a coach I
might discover the next world champion
or I might not but here&#39;s what I do know
if we can all play our part in creating
opportunities to engage in empower women
and young females then they will have
the self belief that they can make a
wonderful contribution on and off the
court
so I will leave you with this thought
next time when dealing with young
females in your life
how would you unleash their imprisoned
energy and harness their potential
because the ball is in your court
