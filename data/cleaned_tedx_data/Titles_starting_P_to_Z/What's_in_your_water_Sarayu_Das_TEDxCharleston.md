everybody loves water whether we&#39;re
talking about the h2o we drink or the
big pools we love to splash around in we
can&#39;t honestly live without it but we
aren&#39;t so aware of what exactly we put
in our water let me ask you a question
how do you dispose of your unused
pharmaceuticals do you place them in the
trash or do you flush them down the
toilet or are you one of those people
who pours them down the drain think
about it for a minute
according to University of Chicago
researchers every year there&#39;s over 2.3
billion dollars worth of unused
pharmaceuticals that end up in our
waters I am here today to make you think
twice about your actions ever since I
was a kid I loved to be around water
I hadn&#39;t lake in my backyard and growing
up it had always been such a huge part
of me whenever it&#39;d be sunny the lake
would shine like a million crystals when
it&#39;d be stormy the dark waters would
crash up against the shore bringing with
it this dark beauty but my backyard Lake
isn&#39;t one of the only places I love the
Congaree National Park in South Carolina
is one of my favorite places to go with
my friends and family if you&#39;re not
familiar with it
the park is this twenty four thousand
acre park located in central South
Carolina it&#39;s actually the National Park
of the state there&#39;s this one time I
remember so vividly from the park I was
about eight years old and I was biking
with my dad on a hot summer day as we
zoomed on by I noticed this flash of
green out of the corner of my eye and I
went to investigate it turns out it was
the small green turtle crawling on the
biking path since it was a hot summer
day I knew that this little guy was in
desperate search of water so I decided
to help him out I found the nearest lake
and I said
down at the water&#39;s edge and sure enough
he scrambled into the cool waters after
this happened my dad kept joking that I
was basically this turtle in spirit
always scrambling to the water&#39;s edge
with this in mind when something bad
happens to a place you hold so close to
your heart
it almost shocks you and that&#39;s exactly
what happened to me two years ago when I
was in tenth grade I was scrolling
through the news when I came across an
article about the park it was found that
there was a high mutation rate among the
fish populations here scientists s&#39;s the
waters and determined high levels of
pharmaceuticals found within the rows
and streams of this park as you can see
here in this picture this fish is not
supposed to be silver and purple it&#39;s
the sign of a mutation this shocked me
and led me to do more online research on
this topic I found out that there are
over 100 different types of
pharmaceuticals found within the rivers
and streams of the world sounds
surprising right
the most common way the pharmaceuticals
are disposed of is by placing them in
the trash and flushing them down the
toilet
even though filtration systems are
effective and removing waste from the
water system 93% of pharmaceuticals are
not detected by any sort of filtration
device which is why they end up in our
aquatic environment all these facts
moving to do scientific research on this
topic and that&#39;s what I did in my 10th
grade I tested the effects of two of the
most common drugs found at the park tri
spring tech which is birth control and
metformin which treats type 2 diabetes
on three prevalent aquatic species
snails plants and crustaceans
I completed experimentation by placing
these organisms and separate habitats
and gradually adding three different
doses of pharmaceuticals to their
environments over a period of time I
complete the experimentation by testing
for the mortality and reproduction of
all the organisms as well as a heart
rate the results I received back were
alarming
even within minut quantity of
pharmaceuticals used which was into 1 to
5 parts per trillion level both the
mortality and heart rate went up
drastically and brought down the heart
rate in my 11th grade I decided to
continue my research and come up with a
plant-based filtration device that can
filter out the eggs already existing
amount of pharmaceuticals in our waters
right now this filtration device has
five parts a settling tank a
pretreatment tank an aeration tank a
coagulation tank and a receiving tank
the settling tank is where the water
initially comes in and then goes into
the pretreatment tank which consists of
fine sand coarse sand and sawdust and
initially filters out the larger
particles from the water the water then
goes into the aeration tank where the
water is aerated which expels the
dissolved gases from the water the water
then goes into the coagulation tank were
there to plant based seeds there and it
acts as an absorbent and it sucks out
the pharmaceuticals from the water
the final purified water then goes into
the receiving tank I tested my filter on
some of the most prevalent classes of
pharmaceuticals found within the rivers
and streams of North America some of
which are antibiotics antidepressants
birth control drugs among others results
revealed that my filter was able to
remove up to 80% of all the contaminants
I tested but even though
even though a solution to filter our
water is critical I think priority
should be given on preventing these
contaminants from entering our water in
the first place
so what can we do as consumers of
pharmaceuticals and scientists of her
era the only way this problem can be
stopped is through community awareness
and proper information regarding this
issue think about a nine year old
healthy girl she could be your daughter
your granddaughter or even your
neighbor&#39;s kid drinking this
contaminated water for a few years could
you imagine what kind of abnormalities
she could develop not even knowing the
source from where these problems are
coming from so let me ask you again what
do we do with the unused drugs that pile
up in her shelves some of the pharmacy
chains have recently started to have
drug take-back kiosks where they will
take back your unused drugs some of the
counties around your state have also
started to have collection days where
they will come around and pick up your
unused drugs similar to the trash and
recycling service you have in your area
contacting your local law enforcement
agency it&#39;s the best way to find out
whether you&#39;re counting sponsors these
collection days contacting your city or
governments trash and recycling service
it&#39;s the best way to learn about the
medical disposal guidelines and options
in your area there are also drug
disposal bags where you can place your
crushed unused drugs into these bags and
the ingredients will neutralize it so
when you do throw away your drugs it
won&#39;t affect our environment everyone
really enjoys the beauty that nature has
to offer and by disposing a few drugs
properly you&#39;re helping to preserve this
beauty for many generations to come I&#39;m
doing my part by bringing awareness now
it&#39;s your turn to do your part by not
putting these drugs in our water in the
first place I started a community
outreach program in my 10th grade
to make people aware of the impacts of
improperly disposing of their drugs and
whenever I&#39;m out
supporting this cause I always like to
take the time to think about the little
turtle that I saved with his cute little
fins and big beady eyes but now I wonder
that turtle that I saved was it
desperately searching for water or was
it actually running from it thank you
