have you ever had the city
something&#39;s been really upsetting you or
you&#39;re bothered about something or
you&#39;re really worried and you can&#39;t
shake it off and somebody says to you
just let it go
and you think yes I&#39;ve been trying to
let it go for ages how do I let go well
that&#39;s what I want to talk to you about
I want to show you how to let go
but I don&#39;t want to just limit out the
situations that you&#39;ve been hanging on
to I want to show you how to let go so
that you can overcome the obstacles in
your life and open up to all of the
opportunities and I&#39;m going to explain
how to let go in a really unique way I
come from the horse world and there&#39;s a
secret and I&#39;ve learned this secret
about how to let go and it works it
works every time and you&#39;re all going to
get the chance to try it right now
because get ready we&#39;re all going to
smile with all four cheeks so if you&#39;d
like to join me just simply smile now
Susan check to make sure your neighbors
are smiling as well because I want
everybody to do this and I fry tighten
those cheeks up that&#39;s it a nice smile
again you see that is within your
control
but I did say four cheeks and that&#39;s
only two cheeks so now we&#39;re going to
look at the other two cheeks and yes I
do mean these cheeks the ones you&#39;re
sitting on so you can stay in your seats
but if you don&#39;t like to join me fry
with these cheeks
so tighten them up really squash them up
tighten them hold it for a second or two
longer and now I think about smiling
with them and soften them you all do it
which is to make sure we&#39;re gonna do it
again and I know if you&#39;re doing it
because your heads will rise up in the
seats so I want to see a whole sea of
heads the Volvo in the room so once
again everybody flying with these cheeks
lets it tighten them up really squash
them crack some walnuts
and I think about smiling with them and
soften them and go a nice smile with
these cheeks that&#39;s smiling with all
four cheeks and I think you&#39;ll agree
you&#39;re in control of that you can&#39;t
actually change your state if you choose
to and jostle notice how lovely that
feels throughout your body the softness
from the top of your head down to the
bottom of your toes have you any idea
how many really wealthy chiropractors
there are in the world because people
walk around uptight and they never
actually learn how to let go so you see
this is a really useful skill they&#39;re
smiling with all four cheeks to let go
and you can use it to overcome any
obstacle in your life but we all know
the biggest obstacle that most of us
face is ourselves so you can smile with
all four cheeks to let go to get out of
your own way and then that opens up all
sorts of opportunities this is me on my
horse Vinnie jumping a big solid fence
an obstacle to be bridged and I&#39;m going
to talk you through getting over it the
takeoff the flying part
and the landing and I want all of you to
come with me now you may or may not have
ridden a horse before but I&#39;m pretty
sure you&#39;ve all been on the plane before
so when I&#39;m talking about flying over
the jump I want you to think about
taking a flight on the plane so just
imagine I&#39;m beside you on the runway
you&#39;re here on the plane I&#39;m here on
vinay I&#39;m gonna fly you&#39;re gonna fly
ready for takeoff everybody
fasten your seatbelts cause you&#39;re
already rolling down the runway and as
you look out the window you can see me
galloping along beside you on vinay
don&#39;t Awards those big white telegraph
poles in the distance and you can feel
the power of the engines beneath you and
you can hear the engines that was very
good that&#39;s the engines of the pin and
I&#39;m galloping along beside you in Vinnie
and I can feel his power the power
that&#39;s going to carry me over my
obstacle and the connection we have is
everything I&#39;ve got to be able to fade
everything that Vinnie does beneath me
he&#39;s got to be able to feel each and
every shift that I make and to make sure
that he can I smile with all four cheeks
and it&#39;s the same thing on the plane
we&#39;re holding on to the seat as if
gripping hold of the armrest is actually
going to help the plane to tick off but
just let go instead let go and soften
and how do you do that you smile with
all four cheeks but you&#39;re lucky though
because the plan will still take off
even if you tighten Vinnie won&#39;t that&#39;s
why this is a secret from the horse
world
Vinnie tells me if you let go I will
carry you over every obstacle if you
cling on we&#39;ll crash and burn so I&#39;ve
had to learn that if I tighten I blow it
five of my friends have died doing this
so this is very real but I don&#39;t let go
so that I don&#39;t die I let go so that I
can fly fly over my obstacles and my
opportunities and as we&#39;re getting ready
to take off there&#39;s a surge of power on
the plane it&#39;s the roar of the engines
on Vinnie there&#39;s an explosion of power
as his big strong shoulders power up to
meet mine and I lean forward to soften
towards him
on a massive horse in midair and it&#39;s
like my heart stops and on the plane
it&#39;s when the tires leave the runway
and there&#39;s no sign but you know you&#39;re
flying I&#39;m flying
Vinnie Airlines but there&#39;s still that
tendency to want to grab hold of the
reins and kick back the control again
and can you imagine what that would look
like if I go and Vinnie&#39;s going it&#39;s a
very different picture to that one it
would be a little bit like you know if
you&#39;re dancing with somebody and they&#39;re
soft they&#39;re moving with you and it
feels great compared to dancing with
somebody who&#39;s all uptight and against
you and it&#39;s just all really
uncomfortable so what do I do I smile
with all four cheeks I let go
i soften and I connect with that power
that&#39;s carrying me over my obstacle and
enabling me to fly but get ready because
here comes the landing so fasten your
seat belts again and on the plane do you
know the way everybody goes as a plane
set Stein that&#39;s smiling with all four
cheeks imagine doing that before the
plane lands but I&#39;m on Vinick how am I
going to learn this Ivan a massive horse
I can&#39;t just fasten my seat belt I have
to breathe my sigh of relief before I
land so I prepare to land by smiling
with all four cheeks cause it&#39;s too late
if I don&#39;t do it in the air I let go i
soften and I connect with the power
that&#39;s carrying me and land in a fashion
that sets me up for my next adventure
even if the worst happens and we fall it
is always better at falling
when these cheeks are soft because then
you don&#39;t fall and break your ass and
think about it if anybody&#39;s ever been
skiing and they&#39;ve had a couple of
glasses of wine at lunch time and then
they fall in the afternoon it doesn&#39;t
hurt at all does it because these cheeks
are soft I rest my case
so that&#39;s it that&#39;s all there is to it
it&#39;s a very simple but a very very
powerful secret I want you to connect
with the power that carries you to let
go and soften and connect with that
power whatever it is for you because we
all have something or we wouldn&#39;t have
got over the obstacles in our past don&#39;t
go through life restricting it zipped up
tight ass can you think of anybody or do
you know anybody who goes around with
those lower cheeks frowning all the time
I can think of a few people who normally
grace these corridors there might be
smiling up there but there&#39;s nothing
going on beneath the waistband and they
will give you a litany of excuses to
justify that krumping in their buttocks
and why they get TMJ and they will blame
their situation and they will blame
other people but the truth is they never
take responsibility to open up under
soften the difference between going
through life like this and like this is
a smile but it&#39;s got to be four cheeks
not just two so humor me again please
prime with all four cheeks a nice smile
see you can do that so back to the photo
it&#39;s just a jump one of many on a course
an obstacle to be bridged in life but
there&#39;s letting go
there&#39;s softening there&#39;s connecting and
there&#39;s love but there&#39;s also power and
drive under termination and commitment
all evident in that photograph that&#39;s
just one moment in my life
but I got it right and they flew you can
fly too
remember smile with all or cheeks thank
you
[Applause]
