babies laugh babies laugh a lot they
laugh at mummies they laugh at daddies
they laugh at siblings they laugh at
grannies they laugh at cats they laugh
at dogs they laugh even while sleeping
in their cots they laugh at songs and
peekaboo babies laugh more than me or
you they laugh while playing on the
swings babies laugh at all the things
but don&#39;t ever wonder why it&#39;s certainly
something that should intrigued me I&#39;m a
developmental psychologist for the past
12 years I&#39;ve been trying to figure out
all the things that babies are learning
how they learn the very beginning of
life and more recently in the last two
or three years I&#39;ve been wondering why
they seem to have such a wonderful time
doing it and this is a bit surprising
because actually being a baby is
confusing and unrelenting imagine the
scene you&#39;ve just arrived on a
completely alien planet you know nothing
about these people or their language its
customs or its culture its animals or
its architecture even the very physics
is alien to you
that&#39;s the boil during start of being a
baby but for a baby it&#39;s even worse than
that let&#39;s think back to your 0th
birthday you&#39;ve arrived cold wet and
helpless into a world you know nothing
about your memory is blank your limbs
are not yours to command you can&#39;t even
lift your own head and have no control
of your bodily functions you don&#39;t even
have a language of your own to think in
and this is the terrifying situation
that babies find themselves in but there
are three cheerful miracles that help
them survive
first babies come equipped with the most
powerful computer in the known universe
babies brains learn more efficiently
than anything else we know in two short
years of being a baby
you probably learn more profound truths
than in the rest of your life
second babies arrived in an extremely
benign environment we can&#39;t help loving
these little invaders into our lives
human parents do more for their
offspring than any any other species
there is third we can communicate from
day one
amazingly from the very beginning of
life we and the baby can make an
emotional connection and as babies start
to succeed we start to hear their
laughter for Aristotle the first time
the baby laughed is the moment that its
soul entered its body so the Navajo
people that first time a baby laugh make
marks its transition from the spirit
realm into the human world Navajo
culture it&#39;s a great honor to be the
person that makes that baby laugh
jointly with the baby you host a
laughter party where you and the baby
provide gifts and give them out to
friends and relatives to teach the baby
about generosity and welcome it into
fully into the community today I want to
explain to you why laughter matters
right from the very start of life and
what we as adults can learn from these
little giggles it comes down to four
simple truths the babies know and we as
adults have often forgotten the first
truth is love the laughter is loudest
the happiness greatest when we with our
friends and loved ones in our survey of
the things that made babies laugh and
made them happy claw of course mummy and
daddy were the funniest before they can
talk
mummy and daddy are babies most
important connections to the world
and the bonding is the purest form of
love that there is the reason that
babies find mommy and daddy so funny is
because this is the best friendship that
there is love bonding is all about
acceptance we do
chide a little baby that starts to cry
or is having difficulties we we rushed
to meet her knees and it&#39;s very easy
because that baby loves his back we are
her world in grown-up world it&#39;s harder
to find love that pure but accepting
people as they are is a good first step
and everyone could improve their
happiness by improving their
relationships the second truth is that
we&#39;re all the same there&#39;s something
Universal about laughter just as we can
share a laugh with someone on the other
side of the world so we can share a
laugh with a baby who does not speak a
single word in fact that&#39;s the job of
laughter it&#39;s a social signal from one
person to another in one experiment we
did with preschoolers we found that
while watching a cartoon on their own or
in a group of just two children they
laughed seven times as much with just
one other child present that shows that
what we&#39;re laughing at is not the things
in front of us but we&#39;re laughing with
the people next to us as the comedian
Victor Borge says laughter is the
shortest distance between two people it
can connect you to anyone anywhere if
you let it
babies do babies give everyone a chance
a city dwellers we will all have been
there you&#39;re on a bus with a man who
just seemed so grumpy and unhappy that
it makes you frown and feel slightly
grumpy yourself but then a baby gets on
board
it starts peering at him over his her
mother&#39;s shoulder and soon he&#39;s smiling
and pulling funny faces about baby
accepted him and that was all it took
and it can work the other way around too
recently I helped Sara Arjun and the
Paul Cayard Children&#39;s Theatre to
develop a play about baby science for an
audience of babies
[Music]
I&#39;ll be bringing a seafood stock
unlike wanna be stone
look at you
[Music]
mazie the actress in the show worked
very hard to be down on their level
being condescending doesn&#39;t work on
babies
so it&#39;s not gonna work on anybody larger
as dr. zhu said a person&#39;s a person no
matter how small and it&#39;s no coincidence
that the best way to make a baby laugh
is to play peek-a-boo it&#39;s all about
social connection it&#39;s all about making
a direct intentional connection with
somebody else
you cannot play peek-a-boo while playing
on your iPhone and babies need this more
than anyone else you start off with a
connection it&#39;s lost its found it soft
it&#39;s found its lost well what do you
know the game babies love it and the
reason they love it is because this is
the very first conversation where
they&#39;re an equal partner this is the
first time where the tooing and froing
is on a level that they can understand
and begin to learn the basics of what it
means to be involved in a relationship a
conversation with somebody else
incidentally this is also why the best
way to make a baby laugh is to take them
seriously don&#39;t start waving little
objects in their faces
pulling silly faces start by doing
nothing listen to the baby tune into
what it is interested in look to see
what it&#39;s looking at when you do this
the baby realizes that it&#39;s got adults
attention adults attention is gold dust
to little babies and laughter is their
payment in kind instantly this works on
adults too no seriously it&#39;s that simple
stop listen to someone really try and
pay attention to what they&#39;re telling
you sometimes we need to learn things
from little children that we
might have already forgotten the third
truth is truth itself knowledge and
learning for their own sake babies have
so much to learn but everyday babies
experience the joy of new discoveries
and this drives them forward like
Archimedes in their bath babies might
leap out shouting Eureka if we weren&#39;t
having so much fun splashing around
playing with their ducks and if they yet
had the words to say express their joys
discovering new things requires a step
into the unknown this is why Eleanor
Roosevelt the wife of the former US
president says you should do one thing
every day that scares you babies may
scream like little scaredy kittens but
they&#39;re driven by an incredible
curiosity they&#39;re always moving to find
new things pushing the boundary of what
they&#39;re comfortable with now this might
be my bias as a baby scientist but I
like to think the babies are little
scientists they&#39;re experimenting and
trying out things on the world to
discover the laws of the world around
them in fact this was why I started
researching baby laughter in the first
place
I was already doing experiments to
understand what babies knew and thought
that laughter might be a different way
into the same information you don&#39;t
laugh if you don&#39;t get the joke neither
does a baby
mummy is gonna come back yes I was right
a dog does not go meow that&#39;s ridiculous
men don&#39;t have blue hair adults as
adults finding new challenges can be
more challenging but Aristotle said that
pleasure comes from achieving mastery
over the world and he was not wrong the
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
investigated the happiest people all
over the world have found that this was
their secret you may know that he
described a state of flow where he gets
so absorbed in doing something really
well
that you lose a sense of everything else
and the the happiest people are the
people who can achieve this state the
most often what you might not know is a
the reason that these people get there
is that they&#39;re constantly challenging
themselves to get better and better or
whatever they&#39;re doing so if you want to
be happy and succeed you too will have
to push your boundaries take whatever
you&#39;re doing now and do it better and
better and better the fourth and final
truth is hiding in plain sight babies
don&#39;t chase happiness they are happy
they live in the moment I see this in
lots of places babies wake up happy I
don&#39;t know why but in the summer of 2015
I went to Brazil to work with Pampers we
wanted to discover what it means to
sleep like a baby we surveyed parents
all over South Paulo and discovered that
almost all babies wake up in a good mood
every morning as I say I don&#39;t know why
but I have tried to do it myself it&#39;s a
little harder for me but it definitely
seems to help
and then babies take pleasure in the
simple things there&#39;s no more clear and
obvious picture of pure pleasure than a
milk drunk newborn woozy and snoozy
after a wonderful big feed as huge smile
spreading across their face or imagine
that baby splashing in the bath or
transfixed by a flower all are absorbed
in the moment reveling in sensations as
an adult
you might try meditation as its heart
meditation is all about stopping to pay
attention to the sensations around you
and the scientific evidence is that this
will make you happy I&#39;ve been meditating
the every day for the past four years
and I can personally recommend it or you
could try music last summer my colleague
Loren Stewart and
I worked with the musician Imogen Heap
to scientifically create a song that&#39;s
designed to make babies happy with
nearly 5 million views on YouTube we
think we&#39;ve succeeded but if you want to
go and find a baby and play them the
happy song and let us know whether they
agree because I can tell you this if you
ever become that grumpy old man there
are two things which will make you smile
one of course is babies but the other is
the emotional connection you have to the
music of your youth laughter makes life
worth living
it is the soundtrack of our triumphs
makes the impossible possible it elates
us it consoles us it connects us it&#39;s
contagious which is the course of our
shared delights and deepens our joys and
our loves babies laugh more than us
because there&#39;s constantly stopping to
look around their little Zen masters
they&#39;re present they&#39;re never in such a
rush to get to somewhere else that they
need Smith the magic of magic of right
now when you are happy make the most of
it slow down and enjoy life you will be
glad you did and if you&#39;re not sure
quite how just ask a baby
