to forget stuff over the school holiday
75% of children go backwards in their
reading and writing Ella that&#39;s my
sister I was asked by her school to keep
a door over the summer holiday to
prevent learning loss I rather eat green
vegetables thing like direful day
but I had an idea of how to make it
better
mom and dad trying to be good parents
ask me what I would look like and how
will work
I believed had to be a cool fun online
app and kids had to want to use it
I explained my dear then we sat around
the kitchen table and drew out my ideas
I thought I was going to be one of those
things when we talk to up but never
turned into reality my family made it
happen
once we found a good app developer we
plotted how the app would work made it
even better testing the loads battling
bugs and got onto the App Store&#39;s I&#39;ve
learned a lot of things along the way
I&#39;ve learned that tech builds bridges I
can draw right get creative add stickers
and photos to my diary and then I can
zap off to my friends I can also zap off
to my family
granny loves hearing about my gang I
love him what she thinks about my day
one more kid it&#39;s easy when your ideas
will be ignored but I want to keep going
I&#39;m Noah I&#39;m ten and Diaries up is on
the App Store&#39;s now so that kids won&#39;t
go backwards in their losing writing
ever again
