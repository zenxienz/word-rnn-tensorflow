there will be 1 million unfilled tech
jobs in the United States in the coming
years 1 million it&#39;s a lot of jobs you
have already heard it referenced here
today pundits are calling this projected
and supply and demand gap the tech
talent crunch and it&#39;s already gotten
started
according to Glassdoor research there
are currently more than 250,000 unfilled
tech jobs costing the economy more than
20 billion dollars annually those
numbers may help to explain why one
third of the HR budgets are dedicated to
recruiting and retaining tech talent and
why ninety percent of executives list
just that as one of their top challenges
two years ago I founded a school that
helps people from non-traditional
backgrounds start careers in technology
to help fill that gap and I&#39;ve come to
believe that the tech talent crunch may
be exactly the crisis the industry needs
to reboot itself for the road ahead
our world is being fundamentally changed
by software tech giants like Google and
Facebook have obvious impacts but there
are countless other less flashy changes
happening in virtually every part of our
daily lives most of you in the audience
probably use online banking I&#39;m guessing
the majority of you have probably called
an uber from your smartphone and the
really brave early adopters amongst you
might sidle into the self checkout lanes
at the grocery stores every once in a
while the point is technology has become
central to company operations across the
board and that&#39;s changing not just how
we as consumers are interacting with
these organizations but it&#39;s also
changing about how they think about
building the teams that they need to run
their businesses in getting ready for
today&#39;s talk I pulled up some job
listings locally in Minneapolis for
JavaScript which is one of the
foundational technologies of the web and
something we focus on at my school and I
found companies hiring full-time
software engineers in the following
industries accounting data security
education government home furnishings
hospitality insurance logistics
manufacturing marketing media medical
and dental care software sports research
restaurants and retail so that&#39;s at
least two breaths worth of industries
and that is in the first four out of six
three pages of results so over
two-thirds of computing jobs are now
outside what most of us would think of
as tech companies the tools that you&#39;ll
all use in the future to shop to access
health care to connect with your family
to get your news to travel and to put
food on your table both figuratively and
literally are being created right now by
designers and engineers in all of these
different industries I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
hyperbole to say that the future of
everything is being written in code if
those are the stakes who&#39;s behind those
keyboards this is what the typical
programmer looks like according to an
annual survey done by a company called
Stack Overflow
they are 89 percent male they&#39;re 88
percent white and Asian and the average
age is 28 75 percent of these people
studied computer science in college
before starting their careers so these
numbers paint a portrait of Technology
generally that looks a lot like Silicon
Valley
both the place and the cast of the HBO
TV show demographically developers
represent only a fraction of our
population but beyond that the majority
have spent their entire careers in
software the people that are creating
software to revolutionize all of these
industries are routinely working with
very little if any personal context of
the sectors they&#39;re seeking to disrupt
and none of this is new but as we
scramble to address those 1 million
unfilled tech jobs I believe that we all
need to agree that the future of
everything is too important to put in
the hands of a small group of people
just because they know how to code
I think the future demands more than
that I believe that organizations need
to build teams inclusive of the
audience&#39;s they aim to serve studies
have shown that organizations with
diverse management teams are 35 percent
more likely to financial returns above
their industry mean and are more likely
to develop new products and innovations
and I absolutely believe that this
principle transfers whole cloth into
software development I think it comes
down to a topic that we&#39;ve heard about
today already which is empathy and my
school one of our core beliefs is that
empathy beats engineering simply put a
well engineered solution to a problem
you don&#39;t understand very well is not
like
to be a success by building a team that
can establish meaningful active empathy
with their users companies can better
understand and serve their needs I&#39;ve
seen what can happen what can be
accomplished by developers and designers
who understand their audience I&#39;ve seen
language apps created by developers who
spent years teaching English abroad I&#39;ve
seen store inventory systems developed
by engineers who started their careers
in retail I&#39;ve seen mental health tools
created by people whose lives have been
touched by mental illness in each of
these cases the life experience and the
user empathy led to a better product
developed more quickly and for lower
cost and while it would be great if that
argument alone sparked a revolution in
the industry to embrace a more inclusive
hiring strategy we might not have to
wait for enlightenment to spark the
change at the end of the day there
aren&#39;t enough programmers to go around
so luckily companies have to think of
different ways to approach things
the explosion of demand and Technology
colliding with a wholly inadequate
talent pipeline is exactly the crisis we
need to shock a complacent industry into
changing their entrenched ideas and
practices around hiring whether to
intentionally build a more inclusive
team or simply to keep up with the
demands of an increasingly digital world
companies are having to re-examine their
processes in order to tap a broader pool
of talent right now while the demand is
so high in the supply so low we have a
unique window to retrain the industry to
embrace talent that can help them build
teams that can develop empathy with
their users that opportunity has helped
to fuel a new breed of immersive
accelerated learning programs that are
helping to bring on under and unhappily
employed people from diverse backgrounds
and demographics into the tech sector
tech boot camps as they&#39;re sometimes
called first appeared about five years
ago but this year more than a hundred
programs will graduate 23,000 people
into the industry that&#39;s about a fifth
of people coming from traditional
sources so it&#39;s starting to really make
an impact in these programs students are
typically spending about five months
studying most of its 60 to 80 hours a
week building skills and software
engineering user experience design and
other in-demand areas it might sound a
little crazy you quit your job and you
dedicate base
every waking moment to learning but it&#39;s
working nearly 90% of the grads from my
school start careers intact within six
months and other programs across the
country have similar success rates so
how do these candidates look relative to
the average developer they&#39;re 57% male
they&#39;re 79% white or Asian and the
average age is 30 so demographically
boot camp grads are more inclusive than
the industry but the biggest difference
is the diversity of backgrounds and the
fact that the vast majority these people
are coming from outside of technology
students hail from a wide variety of
industries but some of the most strongly
represented our retail education finance
and healthcare all of which are
industries that are being actively
disrupted by software and where insights
from the field could be terrifically
relevant if the tech industry wants to
rise to the challenge of reinventing our
world accelerated learning must be part
of the solution alongside other efforts
to diversify the stem talent pipeline
graduates of these programs can help
organizations to diversify their
demographics and backgrounds of their
teams immediately while bringing
valuable context from a variety of
different industries that can help
ground innovative digital solutions with
real-world experience the challenge of
filling those 1 million jobs is an
opportunity for technology to reinvent
itself we can choose to elevate empathy
for users and bring the human side of
software development to the forefront
all that&#39;s required is for organizations
to think critically about who belongs on
the teams that will build the future for
their companies and for their users they
need to embrace non-traditional
candidates who may bring the context and
empathy to the table that can help I
know firsthand that there&#39;s an army of
untapped smart capable people out there
waiting to help change the world with
software we just need to give them a
chance thank you
