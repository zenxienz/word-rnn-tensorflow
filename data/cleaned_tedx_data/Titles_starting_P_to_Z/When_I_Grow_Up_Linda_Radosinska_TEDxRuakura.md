I think most people would consider New
Zealand to be a really safe country to
live in we haven&#39;t got any snakes or
spiders to worry about like our friends
in Australia we can all go to the doctor
if we need to and we&#39;re not involved in
any sorts of Wars or conflicts but as a
country to work in it&#39;s a completely
different story if you work in New
Zealand you are three to four times more
likely to have an accident at work than
your colleagues in the UK and I&#39;m not
talking about minor stuff here either
I&#39;m talking about serious accidents and
fatalities every single day we&#39;re
putting our lives at risk working in
some of the most dangerous workplaces in
the OECD without even realizing it and
in an average week in New Zealand one
person is dying at work and 15 people
are dying from work-related illnesses
and diseases so these are people who
have become sick from their jobs and
eventually it&#39;s gone on to take your
life
that&#39;s almost 1,000 New Zealanders dying
prematurely every single year and these
aren&#39;t just numbers
these are mums and dads sons and
daughters and friends and spouses and
each one of them live behind a loving
family many of whom never even got the
chance to say goodbye and I know that
there are a lot of things happen in life
that are completely out of our control
you know things like bad where they&#39;re
earthquakes or the sorts of genes we
hear from our parents but this this is
not one of those things because every
single workplace death an accident is
preventable and so the real tragedy here
is not only that we lost these people
but that we didn&#39;t have to now we all
know that no talk on workplace health
and safety is complete without at least
one graph so here&#39;s mine and what this
is showing us is that this actually
group of people out there who are having
more accidents at work than the rest of
us
and that&#39;s our young people those in
that 15 to 24 year age group and this is
not something that&#39;s unique to New
Zealand international a young people are
over represented in these sorts of
statistics and have some of the highest
rates of accidents and workplaces all
over the world and as you can imagine
there are a number of reasons for why
this is happening
sorry first of all young people just
haven&#39;t got the skills and experience to
be able to make good decisions that will
keep them safe at work and normally
education should be enough to compensate
for that but in New Zealand that&#39;s
pretty much left up to the individual
employers to provide and there&#39;s no
guarantee it&#39;s going to be delivered any
kind of standard then you&#39;ve got the
issue of the teenagers themselves
because this may actually be the worst
possible time and someone&#39;s life to try
and convince some of the merits of
wearing high vers and safety goggles I
mean they&#39;re not exactly the most
enthusiastic or engaged Bunch at the
best of times but they&#39;re even less so
when it comes to this kind of thing and
really who can blame them I mean most
adults don&#39;t even care about this kind
of thing and we actually understand the
risk now I want you to be completely
honest with me here how many of you died
a little on the inside when you realize
that my talk today was about workplace
health and safety now put yourself in
the shoes of a 17 year old and try to
answer that question again because the
reality is that teenagers stop thinking
about this kind of thing a long time ago
and now they&#39;re thinking about different
things you know they&#39;re at a stage in
their lives where they&#39;re buying a car
or moving out of home maybe traveling
overseas they&#39;re becoming independent
young adults and the health and safety
ship has well and truly sailed for these
people so how do we fix this well it&#39;s
complicated
because there&#39;s something else going on
here too behind the scenes and it&#39;s not
something that&#39;s just suddenly cropped
up out of nowhere
historically we&#39;ve never been great with
Health and Safety you know it&#39;s one
aspect of New Zealand life that
continues to be an issue for us and the
general consensus is that our culture
plays a big part in that so what is our
culture
exactly well we&#39;re resilient and
hard-working we&#39;re creative and
resourceful and we&#39;re more than happy to
have a go at things and it&#39;s that spirit
that has led us to so much innovation
and success in the arts and business and
science and technology in sport but
there are also parts of our culture that
can create real problems for us when it
comes to workplace health and safety
things like our willingness to take
risks to try our luck to make do or to
tough it out all these things can create
the sorts of conditions where accidents
happen and people get hurt now nobody is
suggesting that we need to wrap everyone
up in cotton wool and wear helmets
inside for the rest of our lives but we
do need to realize that there is a big
difference between being tough and being
reckless because when we don&#39;t recognize
that difference the consequences can be
absolutely heartbreaking
in 2010 29 people including a 17 year
old working on his very first shift lost
their lives in New Zealand&#39;s worst
mining disaster since 1914 and in the
months that followed it really felt like
the Pike River mining disaster had
finally put workplace health and safety
on the radar of the average New
Zealander and this tragedy became a real
opportunity for us to draw a line in the
sand and save countless lives in the
future and we have made some progress
since WorkSafe was established in 2013
then we got a new law a couple of years
later unfortunately though
we continue to hear stories in the news
or every other day of another farmer
dying in a quad bike accident or someone
losing a hand at the meat works or being
crushed to death by a machine that were
operating and seven years after Pike New
Zealanders are still being maimed and
killed in the workplace at horrifying
rates now good laws and regulations are
an essential part of dealing with this
there&#39;s no doubt about that but you
can&#39;t just legislate a problem like this
way because at the end of the day the
people who are actually doing the work
are the ones who need to know how to
keep themselves safe while they do it
and the law doesn&#39;t teach us how to do
that how can people be expected to
participate effectively in something
they don&#39;t understand and so if
education is the key but teenagers don&#39;t
care then we have to ask ourselves if
some better alternatives might exist
what if their education started long
before they got anywhere near a
workplace and not on their very first
day on the job a couple of years ago I
asked myself that very same question and
it led me to creating a project that I&#39;d
like to share with you all today so the
project is called when I grow up and
it&#39;s designed to teach 4 to 9 year olds
about very basic workplace health and
safety and the project was all funded by
myself personally so the team consisted
of a grand total of two people an
illustrator from Wellington who I hired
to draw the characters for the project
and myself who created all the content
and the website which launched in theory
of last year so on the website anyone
can go through and learn about 16
different occupations and 33 different
items of PPE or health and safety
concepts as well as finding activities
and worksheets that relates each of the
jobs that have featured on the site and
when I was thinking about what jobs to
include in this project I was thinking
about things like how easy it was going
to be to explain the different health
and safety elements and a little that a
4 to 9 year old could understand
but I was also thinking about what sorts
of jobs these kids would naturally be
really interested in at their age so
there&#39;s no I&#39;m telemarketer or huge fund
trader character I&#39;ve had to glaze over
some of the realities of modern work
just a little bit and the interests of
keeping the little ones excited and
engaged and as you can see girls and
boys are equally represented and there&#39;s
a mix of ethnicities as well so there&#39;s
something for everyone on the side so
how does it work okay well if we have a
look at the pilot character as an
example it shows us how we can talk
about some of the less obvious elements
of workplace health and safety without
getting too deep and technical so we&#39;ve
got sleep and risk to help her cope with
the changing time zones and shift work
compression stockings to help prevent
DVT and water to help keep her hydrated
so that she can concentrate and stay lit
and next if we move across to the Sailor
character it shows us some of the
elements of workplace health and safety
that are more visible to us we see
someone doing their job and these are
the sorts of things that will typically
come to mind when people start thinking
or talking about workplace health and
safety in general so we&#39;ve got a hard
hat to protect him from falling objects
a life jacket in case he falls overboard
and Havers overalls to help his
colleagues see him clearly and one of
the great things about engaging with
kids at this age is that we&#39;re actually
building on all of the other health and
safety education that they&#39;re already
receiving because these kids are having
almost daily conversations with the
appearance and teaches about health and
safety in general so they&#39;re talking
about road safety and fire safety and
water safety so they&#39;re already in that
space so it&#39;s not such a stretch for us
to add on just a tiny little bit of
extra education in the context of the
workplace and actually it complements
what&#39;s going on already and finally
gives them a more complete picture of
what health and safety really means and
considering the fact that a person will
spend an average of 1/3 of their life at
work it seems absolutely crazy to me
that we spend almost zero time educating
people on how to stay safe in the
environments
particularly given the situation that we
have here in New Zealand and of course
one of the other great things about
engaging with the kids at this age is
that unlike the rest of us they&#39;re
actually super excited about the idea of
being in adults and having a job and I&#39;m
sure you can all remember a time in your
own lives when you were really excited
about something and how much more
enjoyable the learning process was for
you because when we&#39;re excited and when
we&#39;re enthusiastic we&#39;re more engaged we
pay attention we listen we learn and
most importantly we remember so this
project can help us to address the issue
of limited health and safety education
the difficulty of engaging with
teenagers and the cultural challenges
that we face as a country when it comes
to workplace health and safety and over
the last year and a half the feedback
that we&#39;ve gotten has been really
amazing and the project will continue to
grow and evolve over time as we figure
out what works best and how we can reach
as many people as possible with the
project the reality is though that this
is not a silver bullet but it is a step
in the right direction and it&#39;s a step
that we all need to take together so if
you have children or other young people
in your life then please take the time
to talk to them about the future use the
site in the characters to help them
understand that the workplace can be a
high-risk environment with its own
hazards just like the kitchen just like
the road and just like the sea and when
you ask them what they want to be when
they grow up I know that each of them
will have a different answer for you and
that answer will probably change over
time but no matter what they do end up
doing in the future I hope that we can
send them off on their first day knowing
that what they will be when they grow up
is safe at work thank you
you
