yep it&#39;s Australian eats out three and a
half times a month and by his takeaway
food four times that&#39;s certainly once a
week I expected more really especially
here in Melbourne with a lot of
fantastic cafes and restaurants show of
hands how many of you a town hall had
take away this past week majority of
your meet mr. and mrs. Lee it&#39;s the
weekends and the routes at st. to the
beach with the kids Lee and Mikey after
a fun day of Sun and surf at sunset the
family decides to get takeaway from the
nearby shopping strip it&#39;s nothing fancy
but it is a treat nonetheless the meals
get served in polypropylene containers
like this look familiar
pretty standard stuff everybody finishes
their meal except for little boy Mikey
so it&#39;s half eaten dinner container and
all get sucked in the bin while the
other empties potatoes go to landfill
and with that the Lee family head home
after a great day out on the other side
of town we have young couple melon Josh
it&#39;s a Friday night and they&#39;re out at a
music festival
the pups chocolate with people and there
are food shots and sights plenty of
excitement all the rounds for melon Josh
it&#39;s a no-brainer
to get food from the trucks it would be
convenient and they&#39;d be able to enjoy
the music whilst waiting in line their
meals conserved in PLA containers like
this melon gesture told that the
containers are biodegradable which
impresses them they finished their meals
and took the containers away into a
nearby bin which is overflowing the
containers get swept up and lined in the
era however melon just don&#39;t think twice
they feel good they use something
biodegradable which containers you think
it&#39;s vessel PLA or polypropylene my name
is Ruby I&#39;m a luster designer and
innovator grew up in Melbourne and like
most Aziz
to do my bit for the moments I&#39;m going
to take you on a journey of what happens
to both these containers back to the Lee
family little Mikey&#39;s half-eaten
takeaway ends up in landfill and just
sits there the food begins to rot and
produces methane a greenhouse gas more
potent than carbon dioxide
but the container but it just sits that
in art doesn&#39;t watch anything so apart
from it being crushed by a compactor
every now and then it remains unchanged
for multiple lifetimes that probably
came as no surprise but how about the
other empty containers that were
thoughtfully put to recycling presumably
they get recycled and designate a
facility Victoria remains Australia&#39;s
leading plastic recycling state it&#39;s
becoming Universal excuse to say yet
thank you this bed of plastic I&#39;ll just
chuck in a recycle bin afterwards or
good some a bit but remember that
recycling something doesn&#39;t mean wiping
away its environmental impacts we become
every Alliance on a recycling system
that is inefficient and incapable of
coping did you know according to a study
published by the journal Science
advances this year up until 2015
we humans have reduced over 6 billion
metric tons of plastic waste globally
and only 9 percent was recycled 12
percent was incinerated and most of this
happened in third-world countries
79% ended up in landfill or the natural
environments 79 percent many first world
countries Australia included an
exporting part of their plastics for
processing where it ends up being
incinerated and you know what happened
so in plastic is burned it releases
noxious gases so much for recycling
we need to do that saw what about MO and
Russia&#39;s POA containers available well
in order for a PLA container to
effectively biodegrade
he needs to be subject to temperatures
of around 60 degrees centigrade for one
month non-stop
Yosi need the right moisture levels and
a whole bunch of other parameters that
coexist only in a man-made environments
so it&#39;s a big problem that melon Josh&#39;s
containers ended up in the Yarra can we
do better
yes and I&#39;m here to show you the better
way forward let me tell you a bit more
Matt myself I&#39;ve always liked making
things especially with old bits and bobs
here&#39;s some stuff I made over the years
this is the clock I made the mold coffee
cup shows a jewelry shoulder piece using
parts from a broken Prince R and finally
a cinema Bob
I dreamed up in primary school dubbed
the cappuccino firm are quite the
budding in Mensa naturally I ended up
studying industrial design it was that
Alliance about up cycling well in a
nutshell you take something old
discarded
Cheeta as a raw material and turn it
something new and useful something about
you bleed racer value similar to
valorisation it&#39;s about appreciating the
resources you have to create new
products from waste products and
furthermore make sure that the product
decomposes back into the earth as a
hundred percent compostable system and
these systems or it exists in Seoul
South Korea
you can&#39;t truck food waste to landfill
server Siddhant take it to collection
points the food is then put through an
organic waste processing machine called
a dehydrator and they are incredibly
efficient within a matter of hours large
amounts of food waste is turned into a
fertilizer of sorts in Australia
naturally have these machines that is
not very common yet collection of
organic waste is not the hard alive are
next time you go to the supermarket or
green grocers have a look around and
you&#39;ll see organic waste bins like this
in Glasgow Scotland
councils provide households with these
waste bins for their food scraps
in Australia we have these resources we
need to embrace these resources by
making more efficient use of them in
India there&#39;s a tradition of street food
vendors certainly customers and little
clay pots single-use ask the customers
on eating the clay pots and purposely
smashed rehydrated and we work to make
new ones let&#39;s not make people change
the habits we love the convenience of
takeaway let&#39;s just do a better job
using the waste system we have and
substitute the containers be currently
used for something that&#39;s better
we need an industry that produces
readily compostable containers some
thinking chuck in the hole in the
backyard and not has to worry about in
2016 I began by creating a compostable
by a panama-based material from scratch
in other words I needed to use waste
products to create some material that
would mold like plastic be strong and
durable like plastic yeah break down
necessary for similar use I seem like a
takeaway container
it&#39;s the perfect package a balance
between the functionality and
appropriate durability as the project
could rust
I created containers for takeaway food
using the material I created from
scratch my product won the 2017 green
innovators award at the National
sustainable living bus tour and it&#39;s
currently patent pending I admit it&#39;s
pretty exciting I use existing thank you
I use existing unappreciated resources
like corn husk the outer green layers
surround the cob so much gets thrown out
in fact corn is one of the most commonly
grown crops in the world the USA alone
produced over three and a half million
bushels during a 2015-16 harvest season
and unlike plantations for wood products
you&#39;re not using any extra natural
resources my product breaks down within
months even if just buried in the soil
much like kitchen scraps and compost
no harmful residue and the broken-down
components are bioavailable to the
environments that&#39;s unlike regular
plastics which is simply break sound
it&#39;s ever smaller pieces of plastic
serum a tally family little Mikey and is
half eat and take away dump to landfill
because you don&#39;t put food and recycling
well just imagine if they can possible
by a panama-based container was used
instead after the meals all the
containers food scraps and all will be
collected in an organic waste bin and
the contents put through an organic
dehydrating machine the resulting
fertilizer will be used to enrich parks
and gardens and their surrounding
neighborhoods let&#39;s catch up with the
beanies mell and Josh they still eat at
food trucks but now they ought to use a
compostable by panama-based container
instead the container still ends up in
the Al&#39;ar but this time there are no
harmful components this is not a dream
this can be reality now the product
exists the bins exist the technology
exists I have my product tested in a
dehydrator machine by tier in Melbourne
the same ones being used in Korea I was
able to successfully demonstrate that my
product readily breaks down but you see
the regular plastic in the red bucket it
still remains you don&#39;t have to give up
easy to take away you don&#39;t have to feel
guilty about boxing homeroom finished
dinner
by simply choosing in make impossible by
panama-based container in situations
where regular plastics are used and by
embracing efficient waste systems with
waste dehydration technologies we have
the potential to save lives the birth
marine and land animals was reducing the
amount of regular plastic that lingers
around now ecosystem together we create
a better future thank you
