thank you for having me it&#39;s great to be
here at Lake Forest College so at five
years old today
I run one of the fastest growing public
relations firms in New York City and I
started that company and began my
journey as an entrepreneur at 15 years
old so I&#39;ve had an interesting and
unconventional 10 years in business and
today I&#39;m gonna talk a little bit about
how I did it and how I think other
people can do it as well thanks to
technology the the playing field has
never been more level for young people
who want to start a business the
Internet it&#39;s created access its created
cost-effectiveness and it&#39;s created an
opportunity for people all over the
world and from every background to be
able to compete no matter what kind of
background would come from how much
money you might have or what kind of
education war relationships you might
have and that was something that I was
able to take advantage of and now it&#39;s
something that I&#39;ve devoted my energy to
helping other people and showing other
people how to take advantage of it as
well so first I&#39;ll tell you a little bit
about how I did it and how I started my
company because that&#39;s what usually
people here that I started the company
at 15 years old and they&#39;re like okay
how did you do that so I was a normal
kid growing up I was a little bit of a
computer nerd but like most 15 year olds
I wanted to find a way to make more
money and it started out as simply as
that I wanted to find a way to make
money and I wanted to start my own
business so I started thinking about
what kind of business I could start
given that I was I was 15 years old and
I looked at the tools and resources that
I had at my disposal and what I might be
able to do with them I I had a computer
and I had an internet connect
and I realized that I needed to find
some way to use that to make money
product of my generation technology is
what I turn to so I started learning
about everything that I could about the
internet and about technology and how to
build a business I started going to the
library every week at 15 years old and
checking out every book that I could
find about advertising marketing
building a business entrepreneurship
which was a totally new term to me to
begin with and I started teaching myself
like things things like how to code
things like how to build a website how
to market and sell products online I
learned about this new concept called
search engine optimization to drive
traffic to your website using search
engines and I started teaching myself
all these things and I started building
small websites I started kind of getting
my feet wet in driving traffic to
websites and building small online
businesses and while I was doing that I
realized that the skill that I was
developing was something that other
businesses might need as well especially
local businesses in my neighborhood keep
in mind that this was 10 years ago
so internet marketing was still
something that was very new most small
businesses weren&#39;t marketing themselves
online at this point and even most major
corporations weren&#39;t really paying
attention to digital and online
marketing at the time so in in one way I
might have haven&#39;t had an advantage in
that way that it was something new and
and there weren&#39;t a lot of people
selling it but at the same time it was
something so new that most businesses
didn&#39;t even see the value in it they
didn&#39;t see the opportunity in being able
to sell their products online yet so I
started out very small I started
marketing myself as a web designer and
as an internet marketer and keep in mind
this was priests most social media it
was pre Facebook it was pre LinkedIn and
getting clients on the internet back
then was something that most businesses
were not doing it was very difficult
especially for somebody who had no
experience in business whatsoever no
sales experience so it was difficult but
I started marketing myself as a
marketing company
as a web design agency and I used
websites like Craigslist and classified
s online forums where business owners
were exchanging ideas and networking and
I was marketing myself and I had a
little bit of success in the beginning I
started very small like I said selling
my services to build a website for about
$250 or $500 and I I started to see a
little bit of success every once in a
while
I would find a client who might buy a
website from me or who might buy some
kind of a marketing services from me but
it started out very small about about
six months into it
I was on an online forum for
entrepreneurs to to network and share
ideas and I ended up seeing a post from
somebody who ran a consulting firm in
Washington DC and he was looking for a
company to help him with search engine
optimization now
six months ago I had no idea what it was
but being the expert that I now
considered myself to be I reached out to
him through the forum and let him know
that he had found a search engine option
expert and I was going to help him grow
his business long story short he decided
to give me a shot he was a very small
shot I think he gave me something like
$250 to help him drive more traffic to
his website and market his web site over
about a month&#39;s time it went well
we helped his website to rank on Google
for a couple key terms for his business
and it drove more traffic to his
business that increased his sales and we
had proven ourselves I had proven myself
I was I was going around talking about
how I had this agency but it was just me
obviously doing all the work and doing
all the sales but we had proven
ourselves and he liked the results that
we got him and he gave me another order
and after getting results on on that
order he gave me another one and over
the course of about six or seven months
what was a $250 client ended up scaling
up to a six-figure contract to do search
engine optimization for his company and
keep in mind that I was still you know I
was about 16 years old at the time so
this was huge for me this was this was
you know this completely changed my
perspective on you know what was
possible for building a business and and
you know the fact that I could even make
this a business this was like the first
real result that I saw this was my first
real client having him as my first
client gave me the platform and cashflow
that I needed to reinvest into my
business reinvest into my marketing
reinvest into my own website and
actually start to build a real company
and that&#39;s when we started to market
ourselves better I started to hire some
freelance contractors to help me with
the workload
I started getting a better website
getting better advertising and I started
getting referrals from that first client
who was referring his other friends who
were in companies to come work with us
and to grow their own online marketing
and that&#39;s what started at all and from
there we grew organically over the year
largely through referrals through
word-of-mouth marketing through you know
networking through speaking it at
conferences but you know at 15 years old
I was running this business completely
through a computer in my parents home
and not a single client knew that I was
15 years old and in fact that client we
met in person for the first time when I
was 20 and so he was visiting New York
on business and we met for the first
time he wanted to meet up and have a
face-to-face meeting and kind of put you
know a face to the name and we met at
this restaurant in a hotel in New York
City and he was like do you want to have
a drink and I was 20 years old at the
time so I was like no you know I&#39;ll pass
them I&#39;m not gonna have a drink and we
started talking and talking about his
business and talking about my company
and about a couple you know 15 20
minutes in he was like so so how old are
you and I was like that&#39;s a good
question I am 20 going on 21
in a few months and he was and obviously
he was extremely surprised he was I
would have had no idea because you sound
like an old man the way do you conduct
business through the internet so I was
like thank you
but none of my clients up until that
point had ever met me face to face I&#39;ve
never had to actually face any of them
in person to in the business but yet
still at that point in time where the
time I was 20 years old I was running a
multi six-figure business completely on
a laptop at home in my parents house and
it completely changed you know my
perspective number one on on on business
and it also changed the whole trajectory
of my life so that that kind of led to
where we are today we since then we&#39;ve
we&#39;ve grown organically and we&#39;ve
bootstrapped
to now where we&#39;ve become a million
dollar company that works with
companies from startups to Fortune 500
companies political institutions
politicians government clients to this
to where we are now where we have
offices in Rockefeller Plaza in New York
City so it&#39;s it&#39;s been a pretty amazing
journey and I realized a couple years
ago that there&#39;s so much potential out
there and there are so many young people
who want to do something where they&#39;re
starting their own business and they&#39;re
starting to see the potential of the
Internet has but they still don&#39;t really
know how to do it and that&#39;s when I
started deciding that you know I wanted
to reach out to more young people who
want to do it and kind of show them the
path that I took and how they might be
able to do it as well I started speaking
at schools I started speaking at high
schools and colleges and and talking
about how I did it and and talking about
just my experiences and I was surprised
how many young people wanted to do it as
well but thought it was out of reach for
them because they didn&#39;t have the
education maybe or they didn&#39;t have the
money or they didn&#39;t come from the
background it&#39;s interesting that now
that that&#39;s that&#39;s starting to change a
little bit because now I speak at high
schools and I have kids telling me about
how they want to be become a YouTube
star when they grow up or they want to
become an Instagram influencer when they
grow up
so with so it&#39;s changing and the
question that I started to ask was what
what would it take to be able to create
more young entrepreneurs more young
people who want to create a product or a
service and build a business it&#39;s
amazing if you look at most of the
devices that we spend most of our time
on every single day a lot of those
products were created by young
entrepreneurs were created by people
sometimes in college if you look at
Facebook or if you look at snapchat and
Instagram or even if you look at the
products there too now Microsoft and
Apple both started when they were in
college so I started asking myself what
are the what are the factors we know
what are the things we need to do to be
able to create more of these young
entrepreneurs and the answer that I came
up with was there were three things one
of them is technology which helped me
the second is culture
and the third is education the first one
obviously technology like I was saying
the Internet has leveled the playing
field for so many people and the more
places in the world that the internet
spreads to the better off the world is
it&#39;s created access to markets for
people anywhere in the world that&#39;s why
we&#39;re seeing startups from 16 year old
entrepreneurs that are competing with
fortune 500 companies it&#39;s created that
access to a market where literally
somebody at 15 years old in their
parents house can use a laptop to
compete with a major company for for a
client or for business and never have to
leave their home and actually have an
opportunity to win that business it
becomes based on merit and based on
being able to get results versus be you
know how much money you might have or or
how much marketing you may be able to
afford it it&#39;s created an opportunity to
reach people nowadays you can use
Twitter and you can reach millions of
people with your message virtually for
free whereas 10 years ago or 20 years
ago that would have cost millions of
dollars to buy television advertising to
buy radio advertising and it&#39;s it&#39;s also
created productivity higher higher
efficiency it&#39;s it&#39;s now easier than
ever to be able to go online and start a
business and you use tools that enable
you to keep up and create a product and
create a service by yourself at home on
a limited budget it costs less than $100
to build a professional website now and
then reach your customers for free on
social media those tools have created
access they&#39;ve created cost efficiency
and they&#39;ve also created productivity
efficiency so technology is important
making sure that we educate people on
the power of technology and making sure
that we do what we can to get technology
out to the world and to the people who
need it and can use it to better
themselves better their community and
better their market the second is
culture I started finding that when I
was speaking at schools and and even
just visiting other countries and
meeting with entrepreneurs in other
countries whether it was at schools
whether it was at store
incubators there&#39;s a huge stigma around
failure kids are taught not to fail
you&#39;re taught in school not to fail
you&#39;re taught not to do poorly on tests
you&#39;re taught not to know the answer to
not not know the answer to a question
when a teacher calls on you and failure
gets stigmatized it gets stigmatized as
a negative thing and that translates
through when you become an adult and you
want to start a business and your first
thought is well this doesn&#39;t work out
I&#39;m gonna hear about it at Thanksgiving
or you know I&#39;m gonna it&#39;s gonna look
bad on Facebook it&#39;s gonna look bad if I
have to go back to my old job and that
kind of negative stigma associated with
it is holding so many people back
especially young people in school who
you haven&#39;t even gone out into the world
yet and they&#39;re already afraid of
failing and they&#39;re already thinking
about well what would be the safest path
what would be you know the more
conventional path that I can take so
bringing more acceptance and embracing
that risk of failure and knowing that
you need to fail before you can succeed
and helping ingrain that into the
culture and and build a better
acceptance for it is going to be key to
making sure that the young people who
are in school now who are in college now
feel like they can go out there and they
can try something different that they
can try to break the mold that they can
curve the straight line that they can do
something that you know maybe their
parents didn&#39;t do or in previous
generations it wasn&#39;t really something
that you did if you didn&#39;t come from a
certain background so we need to find a
way to change that culture we need we
need to talk about it we need to open up
that conversation and number three
education obviously education has
advanced greatly over the past couple of
generations and obviously there there
are more colleges now who offer
entrepreneurship classes and
entrepreneurship centers than ever
before and that&#39;s great but there&#39;s
still a ways to go there&#39;s still
technology changes very quickly the
economic landscape changes very quickly
especially now we&#39;re seeing innovation
happen over five-year periods now that
would have taken 40 years just a
generation or two ago and it&#39;s been
difficult for education to keep up with
that it&#39;s been difficult for there to be
education for people about how to market
their business using social media or how
to take advantage of opportunities
online that frankly are popping up new
opportunities are coming up every day
now you can be a YouTube influencer and
Instagram influencer and that didn&#39;t
even exist you know five years ago so we
need we need to encourage not only just
creating better education and more
access to education but also self
education remember that when I started
my company I learned 90% of what I
learned building my business from going
to the library from checking out books
now we have Google now we have a tool on
the internet that the greatest knowledge
tool ever created you have more
information at your fingertips right now
then we&#39;ve ever had in history you have
more information at your fingertips now
then the President of the United States
had 40 or 50 years ago but we use it to
look at cat videos on YouTube we use it
to look at what our friends are eating
on Instagram and there needs to be more
awareness around the value that that&#39;s
in that tool and how you can use it to
change lives change communities change
economies and how we can help young
people become more aware of that
opportunity how we can encourage them
more and how we can help enable them
with the tools to be able to go out and
innovate and create the next generation
of products that are going to advance us
forward and keep advancing our society
and our communities and our families so
that that&#39;s what I want to do I hope
I&#39;ve done with this talk is just open
your eyes to the opportunities that are
out there the opportunities that are
there for anybody no matter what your
background is to go out there and learn
about it figure out what your passion is
create a plan most likely thanks to
technology you can figure out a way to
build a life or a business or a career
around that passion and I hope that
you&#39;ll find that
thank you
