I&#39;m going to take you on a journey it
was midnight and I was standing on a
Mediterranean rooftop the waves were
crashing loudly on the beach in front of
me in the distance a storm cloud was
lighting up the sky above me shooting
stars were darting across the night and
since then silhouetted behind me the
volcano was erupting now I was
surrounded by inspiring entrepreneurs
who were talking about their ideas their
businesses the future they were sharing
moments and friendships and I thought to
myself how on earth did I get here
this scene I&#39;ve just described to you
happened only three months ago on the
beautiful volcanic island of Stromboli
in Italy I&#39;d visited Stromboli over the
years for Pfister del Falco
the international fire dancing festival
and this time
with the help of the Pfister team I&#39;d
brought together a bunch of
entrepreneurs for something a bit
different
15 entrepreneurs had come to the island
for the inaugural entrepreneurs volcano
retreat the entrepreneurs are a mixture
of digital nomads solopreneurs and
changemakers and running this was
blurring the lines of work and play
which to me is the ultimate definition
of success now over the last 10 years
I&#39;ve been on an adventure that led me to
this volcano
I started off studying biotechnology at
the University of Otago as I was
passionate about the real-world
applications of science I had amazing
hobbies and still walking in fire
performance and I had jobs and Events
Management
I loved bringing people together to
share moments
an inspiration whether it was
volunteering or festivals or retreats or
business performing or ideas and towards
the end of my science degree I wanted to
learn more about business and I noticed
that the the people I found really
interesting around university they were
these entrepreneurs and at that stage I
didn&#39;t even know what entrepreneurship
was but I also found out there was this
master&#39;s of entrepreneurship at the
University so I went and studied it for
two years and it was a whirlwind of
ideas to change the world of meeting
interesting people of overdosing on
adrenaline and caffeine it was epic and
my journey into this crazy world of
entrepreneurship had just begun during
my Master&#39;s I co-founded highly flamable
entertainment which essentially was a
combination of my passions and events
management business and for bringing
people together to challenge themselves
and challenge the world we live in to
break norms through providing crazy
creative entertainment highly flamable
entertainment is now 7 years old and we
have a team of a hundred amazing people
New Zealand wired our crazy characters
include fire dancers stilt walkers glow
performers jugglers pyrotechnics and of
course the incredible Mara man human
disco ball so a few years ago about
three years ago things took a turn I was
getting bored
we had taken highly flammable New
Zealand Wyatt and I was ready for a new
challenge so I did some travel and
initially I thought about launching
highly flammable overseas but then I
came across this world of digital nomads
now digital nomads are people they can
work remotely often just using their
left
some of them have really flexible jobs
whereas others have their own online
businesses so I started learning about
this new way of working and living I was
learning about lifestyle
entrepreneurship and remote working
I read the 4-hour workweek which is an
amazing book for these ideals read four
hour workweek really inspired the next
part of my journey so I started to
manage highly flamable more remotely I
started to create some online courses
and I expanded on my entrepreneurship
teaching work and of course I was
getting to travel all over the world and
it was amazing
papa was in Iceland Burning Man festival
Nevada getting to meet Richard Branson I
even got to go hiking in the mountains
of Kyrgyzstan then two years ago I got
to do a piece on sixty minutes with
calculon we got to paint this world of
the digital nomads we got to have our
cake and eat it too
travel the world while running our
businesses remotely skipping the 9 to 5
grind people online and friends and
family they were so Wow
congratulations Logan you&#39;re so
successful you&#39;re doing all these
amazing things I mean imagine if you&#39;re
in my shoes right you would have been
having a great time too but it sort of
reached a point where I was hitting this
wall I mean it was fun but we was the
future in it where was the passion in
the purpose and the meaning in the past
where I was blurring those lines of work
and play now was kind of just working
and then playing it all started to seem
a little bit self-centered and
hedonistic and I started to feel
isolated
I was also disconnected from their
amazing highly flamable team and
community that I&#39;d built I was lacking
those epic conversations that I used to
have I met some cool people on my
adventures but most of them
didn&#39;t seem they&#39;re interested in their
businesses they wanted to talk about the
latest surf trip to Bali but the
business was some boring blog or some
internet marketing thing that kind of
sounded like a scam so I started some
self-reflection I started to really
think about what it is I want to do and
for the world and I started searching
for other like-minded passionate people
and communities and I found that these
communities do exist communities like D
in X a digital nomad community based out
of Berlin I also started attending
retreats like fellow Kiwi nationally
Sissons freedom retreat and Bali then of
course I started running my own retreats
to the volcano retreats the other thing
I did was I reconnected with my highly
flamable team and community and I saw
more of the purpose and the passion
behind highly flamable as well see it&#39;s
not just about the flesh he mirrored
suits the flames or the stilts it&#39;s
about this amazing community of people
that challenge themselves build personal
confidence and professional development
in a supportive environment and I saw
that to really blur those lines of work
and play there were three key things
that I needed to refocus on passion and
fun for what I was doing meaningful work
that really matters and that amazing
supportive community around me so let&#39;s
think about this a little bit more
deeply business is hard right like it&#39;s
really really hard it&#39;s those things
that those online Entre Nous memes often
forget the late nights the lack of
direction the painful lessons the
challenging employees the tough clients
sometimes getting burned sometimes
literally maybe some of those things are
the reasons why you haven&#39;t started a
business
it or maybe you see this world of
entrepreneurship as a little bit
self-centered then there&#39;s all of this
kind of marketing a dreamy
scammy sounding stuff is it even real
would you leave your stable reliable
full-time job for that see the thing is
when you build a business based on
passion and meaning with that surround
surrounded by that amazing community it
actually builds more robust business it
builds a business that you&#39;re gonna
stick around for a business that you&#39;ll
leave your day job for and when those
challenges come you&#39;re gonna break right
through them so this journey I&#39;ve been
on I took the long road and I want to
help you to skip the hard parts because
it&#39;s so much harder to bolt the stuff on
later so I&#39;m going to get into some
house so firstly you don&#39;t want to be
working at some desk doing something you
don&#39;t care about building someone else&#39;s
dream entrepreneurship is about solving
problems that you care about or as I
like to say solving real pains Richard
Branson once said if you aren&#39;t making a
difference in other people&#39;s lives then
you shouldn&#39;t be in business so what are
some problems that you care about what
are some things about the world that
really annoy you secondly what are your
passions write out a list what are some
things that get you really excited what
are some of your hobbies how do you
spend your spare time if you never had
to work again
what would you do then build that
supportive community around you from the
start even before you come up with that
idea surround yourself with inspiring
entrepreneurs
start a mastermind were you bring
together people to talk about challenges
and wins attend conferences and retreats
not because you want to make sales but
because you want to really connect and
build that supportive community around
you we are the average of the five
people we hang out with the most and
that is so true then lastly sometimes we
get so wound up in the business of
living that we really forget to take
time to think so reflect on the past
journal meditate practice mindfulness
try yoga every year I go on a three-day
personal retreat to mount cook and I
reflect on the past and I plan the
future and out of everything it makes
most difference so I&#39;ve gone through
this list and some of you are probably
going yeah cool story Logan that&#39;s great
but I&#39;m not an entrepreneur I don&#39;t want
to start a business I&#39;ve got a stable
reliable full-time job actually
however opportunities and advances in
technology mean then it&#39;s easier for
more and more people to get involved in
this world of entrepreneurship we&#39;re the
world of jobs is getting less secure
entrepreneurship is getting easier less
risky and cheaper you&#39;ll find now that
the entrepreneurship journey is getting
easier by the day because of all of
these changes now the other thing about
entrepreneurship is it&#39;s your best way
to give impact and value to the world
and also to reach your own full
potential so this journey I&#39;ve been on
I&#39;m gonna keep going I&#39;m gonna keep
blurring those lines of work and play
I&#39;m going to keep growing those
communities and connecting with those
communities through my businesses in my
treats I feel like my journey into that
crazy world of entrepreneurship it&#39;s
just starting all over again and for you
your volcano is waiting so come join us
[Applause]
