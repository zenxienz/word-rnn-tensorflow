yesterday on my way to this event I went
to a multinational coffee shop and it
was not the answer time kind of coffee
shop knowing I was in Germany I asked
the barista after receiving my coffee
could I pay by card and she responded
with a very bold not to release I didn&#39;t
think it was all that natural being in
Germany that you could pay by card but
hey there we go
she got the card machine ready and I
pulled my debit card I tapped boom big
eyes staring at me I didn&#39;t know you
could do that what had just happened
well I had taken a closer look at the
card machine and I realized he could pay
contactless sometimes known as NFC Near
Field Communication and I have pulled my
contactless enabled debit card and just
tapped the barista and I were sharing a
mutual moment of flabbergast
she saw something incredible knew that
she had never seen before and I had
experienced the digital backwardness of
German society
this goes to show and this is exactly
what this talk is about digital
transformation is not easy it is hard
and what I want to identify in this talk
and what I want to talk about are some
of the major roadblocks some of the
negative things some of the things that
you have to overcome to transform
digitally and then identify the
potential of innovation and how can we
make digital transformation happen in
our everyday lives and across society
one more hint before I start digital is
not about the internet the first thing
that comes to your mind when you think
about digital is the internet but it&#39;s
not at the beginning nor at the end of
digital digital is about human needs and
I will explore three areas exactly to
show you this number one transportation
well transportation is a fun topic to
talk about in Germany because German the
German economy much depends on car
makers prestigious car makers that
historically have relied on well you
could say outdated engine
and these days the car makers in Germany
are shining with emission scandals
rather than innovation now the first
example I&#39;m going to show you is a
negative example of how digital
transformation and transportation don&#39;t
go along in Germany the second example
will be a success story so bear with the
negative example first
in 2009 Ober was founded Hoover had as a
unique selling point using the location
services of your smartphone and internet
connection yes the Internet was
important and it could match you with
the driver in real time you could get a
driver in almost no time and even more
you could pay without cash you didn&#39;t
have to have any cash on you no cards
nothing just your phone and internet
connection GPS that says now as you may
know German courts didn&#39;t really like
the idea of over and in many other
places in the world courts didn&#39;t like
Oran neither do politicians and love ye
ISM organisations so this is a failure
of digital transformation in Germany why
sent well first let&#39;s explore the
threats to German society well yes you
have a set of selected drivers and
that&#39;s it they hold the monopoly then
think about the pricing model the
pricing model of traditional taxis is
fixed there is no supply demand
balancing here uber tried to break this
they wanted to match demand and supply
in real time which is groundbreaking
it&#39;s a unique selling point now
German courts did they make a mistake
maybe they acted on existing law they
made decisions based on laws that exist
in Germany so they did what was the best
in their opinion they did their best
judgment but politicians weren&#39;t able to
adapt to innovation fast enough did or
make a mistake and that&#39;s the bigger
question and there&#39;s a very clear answer
to this they did they didn&#39;t talk to
lawmakers they didn&#39;t talk to lawyers
they didn&#39;t prepare their market entry
they just bulldozed into the German
market and expected
everyone to scream and get get happy
about uber no but they didn&#39;t that goes
to show laws are incredibly important
sometimes societies and cultures are not
ready but most importantly laws have to
be changed to make things happen that&#39;s
a negative example let&#39;s move on to a
positive example in 2009 the same year
that Auburn was founded a company called
Google started developing self-driving
cars
now this is alphabet not Google anymore
and actually self-driving cars the idea
was developed in the early 20th century
so who will just reignite it a fire and
by now you&#39;ve heard of all of them Tesla
uber Apple all of them seem or publicly
not so publicly to be developing
autonomous driving self-driving cars
even the car makers themselves are
involved self-driving cars are not about
the internet think about it what&#39;s the
primary motivation for self-driving cars
safety safety first imagine a world
where there would be no accidents
because all cars could communicate with
each other that&#39;s amazing so safety
first there was no internet number to
better traffic flow imagine a world
without congestion without traffic jams
anymore amazing less fuel consumption
sooner or later we&#39;re not gonna have
petroleum anymore we don&#39;t need oil but
for now we have it and reducing it is a
major goal of self-driving cars because
less traffic jams less fuel consumption
less time spent in the car because
everything is automated now how is this
a success story self-driving cars in
Germany you might wonder two months ago
both houses of the German legislature
that wonder Scott and the Bundestag
passed a law that allows fully and
highly automated cars on public roads
when they&#39;re launched that&#39;s crazy right
there is no self-driving car and
launched yet yes the German government
has already allowed them onto the public
road isn&#39;t that a stark contrast to the
uber example now how did this happen
how did this success come about you
wonder while politicians are quite
interested in cars in Germany there&#39;s
massive car makers and high-ranking
politicians are quite involved in the
car making industry they know that a
politician success depends on the car
maker success khalid lobbyism call it
protectionism this is a success story
this is great Germany is one of the
first countries in the entire world to
pass legislation on self-driving cars
amazing there are a few conditions to it
for example you need to have a human
that is able to drive there have to be
pedals and the steering wheel that&#39;s why
it&#39;s not autonomous driving it&#39;s highly
and fully automated driving but imagine
nothing happens during the ride and the
human doesn&#39;t have to intervene then
that&#39;s a fully autonomous drive
it&#39;s just safety message measures and
even the insurance question has been
answered insurance in Germany is always
a big deal right whenever you want to
make something happen think about
insurance fire-safe with oh my goodness
Berlin Airport shall I say more they
answered that question in no time they
passed the law crazy that&#39;s amazing
let&#39;s move on to the second area that I
want to explore very exciting finance
well that doesn&#39;t sound right does it my
opening was the first example pain
contactless pain cashless I&#39;m gonna
bring up another example in just a
second but first let&#39;s think about
cashless societies have you heard of
Denmark and Sweden their legislation
does not require merchants or points of
sale to have coins and notes available
they can basically force the consumer to
pay with card that&#39;s that&#39;s as
progressive as it gets
Germany is quite different but I want to
talk about a different example I want to
talk about m26 some of you might have
heard of m26
they&#39;re operating across almost all
eurozone countries now and they&#39;re
they&#39;re a thin tech startup as you call
it financial technology right what is
their unique selling point their unique
selling point is push notifications onto
your phone in a real time when it&#39;s
section is incoming or outgoing super
cool second of all and that is much more
impactful in a very tangible way they
don&#39;t have physical branches you want to
open a bank account do it online you
want to get a credit card you do it
online you want to get a loan you do it
online everything is done online they
don&#39;t even have ATMs they have nothing
and that is groundbreaking but what is
even more groundbreaking and more
surprising it&#39;s a German company what so
there we see the potential of digital
transformation in Germany and how to
make it happen they even got a banking
license now they&#39;re a full-fledged bank
basically one of the challenges that
remains and that was what I was
referring to in my opening is Android
pay Apple pay paying with your phone
amazing I live in Ireland I can pay with
my phone
I don&#39;t need my wallet anymore I just
have my phone and I can do everything
with my phone here in Germany banks and
regulators are not yet cooperating as
much but there&#39;s rumors that Apple and
Google are gonna make their way into the
Germany market sooner or later right so
let&#39;s hope for the best the last area is
one that concerns all of us and it&#39;s one
that is changing human behavior in
impactful ways in many different ways
let me ask you a question who here has
used a dating app raise your hands come
on interesting split between the left
side of the office
that would be nice to study in a social
psychologist now imagine a world without
dating apps and for those who haven&#39;t
used the dating app let&#39;s do something
different
imagine a world without social media no
Facebook no whatsapp no Instagram no
snapchats and even those of you who
don&#39;t like social media there&#39;s many
different ways you connect now that you
haven&#39;t connected beforehand well this
last example is a bittersweet example
the examples before I try to show how
digital transformation can help you mean
everyone around us people that we don&#39;t
even know social media is interesting
dating apps are interesting now let&#39;s
talk about tinder you know tinder this
app where you swipe dozens of humans in
a matter of seconds without reading
their profiles because you don&#39;t care
you just look at the first fiction
that&#39;s it yeah that&#39;s tinder tinder is
not the first big app that connects
people for dates networking chats etc
based on your smartphone&#39;s location
services some of you might have heard of
an app called Grindr it&#39;s for gay means
they would develop this app years before
tinder was developed this app had the
same principle you use your location
services
you see people listed by distance some
people don&#39;t show their distance so it&#39;s
privacy safe whatever the point is you
were able to connect with other people
that have similar interests and talk to
them you didn&#39;t have to come out of the
closet to talk to them it&#39;s great it&#39;s
awesome now how is this negative you
would think because it&#39;s great it helped
youth it helped older people that helped
everyone that was identified as a gay
male or transgender gay bars and gay
clubs started shutting down when Grindr
became big interesting right you would
think why is that Grindr became the new
safe space you know if you talk to gay
males in their 30s 40s 50s maybe they
would tell you back in the day they had
to meet physically in actual you know
actual locations actual
use to get to know people with similar
interests to meet up even just for chats
for for whatever they want is they had
to meet physically they were safe spaces
gay bars and gay clubs were the safe
spaces they didn&#39;t have a justification
to exist anymore after Grindr came up
because people can meet one-to-one
online without having to go out so gay
places started shutting down people lost
their jobs and actually nightlife wise
many cities became a little more boring
because there were less gay places
around this goes to show that whenever
you think about digital transformation
you have to anticipate consequences even
if they&#39;re negative you have to think
about this keep this in mind if you want
to do innovation do something that&#39;s
good for everyone and if there are risks
associated with digital transformation
try to mitigate the risks now let me
come to an end to slowly what I try to
show is that in order to make digital
transformation happen from all these
examples shown before is that lawmakers
need to care who are the lawmakers
they&#39;re politicians we need to make
politicians care who else is involved in
the lawmaking process lawyers lobbyism
organizations etc we need to make these
people care only if they care about
digital transformation laws will happen
and how can we make these people care by
carrying ourselves if we use digital
products if we use apps if we use all
these tools that are at our disposal we
can make a difference we have to provide
feedback those people who develop
digital tools need feedback they rely on
feedback and even if it&#39;s like a drop on
a very hot stone this feedback does make
a difference because many drops add up
to a barrel full of water right so let
me get simplify this in three easy
points derive from the above examples
number one laws you have to establish a
legal framework to make digital
transformation happen think about the
most successful digital tools in the
world they&#39;re all social media why
because no law needed to be created
changed or abolished to make social
media available and to bring it into the
market well you could argue now there&#39;s
anti hate speech regulation especially
in Europe and in Germany but this is the
first time legislators and social media
developers are actually clashing a
little bit think back to Auburn they
bulldozed into into the German and
French markets nobody liked them their
model is not working at least not as
good as they imagined it to you so this
is number one establish a legal
framework number two think beyond the
internet think back to the self-driving
car example it is not about the internet
always the human needs don&#39;t revolve
around the internet just yet
what we need is wealth what we need is
happiness what we need is safety health
joy so many things love if you think
about dealing in us so identify these
human needs when you want to make
digital transformation happen before
thinking about the Internet the Internet
can help you scale the Internet can help
you reach masses in no time
but only when you&#39;ve identified a human
need and found a solution to this need
then you can think about how to scale it
and how to spread the word and last but
not least and this is where I&#39;m gonna
end my talk let&#39;s get the eff started
only if we walk out here we think about
all these points we think about negative
and positive examples about success
stories about failures we have this
knowledge at our hands only if we get
started if we take action right now we
care ourselves we make other people care
we can actually make digital
transformation happen in no time thank
you very much
you
