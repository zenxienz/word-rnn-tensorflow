coming out thanks for yeah I got a loud
voice mister sound man
thanks for everybody who sponsored it&#39;s
a tremendous and beautiful day table of
contents this is about how I as Steven
said learn to hear myself a little
louder and went from serving as an
individual to serving through
partnerships and eventually from the
private sector side that doesn&#39;t mean I
think I evolved from something to
something better it&#39;s just I just
learned as Steven said to hear myself a
little louder
and now disclaimer I am holding a
digital device laughter please look at
him all laughing back there and as
you&#39;ll see in the presentation that in
and of itself is pretty funny if you
were a pop music fan in the mid 90s I&#39;m
looking around maybe some of you were
yes there is you would have heard a song
called Angeline it was a big hit had a
big TV star in the video it was a great
great thing and it was very exciting and
if you were to listen on a set of
headphones maybe at home in the evening
you would hear my lawnmower interesting
story that record was made just up the
block as so many wonderful records were
at that time for a little studio just a
few blocks up from here I was fortunate
enough to be in with a with a great
bunch of partners we made simple rock
and roll Sol country R&amp;B records and we
were having a great a great run so I had
these guys in the studio who did this
record and it had been raining for eight
ten days and it finds the rain finally
led up and I said hey guys we got to air
this place out back then we smoked in
studios terrible terrible I know we
gotta air it out and I gotta mow my
grass so they said all right to mow your
grass so I&#39;m mowing my grass I come back
in and they&#39;re doing a listen through
and they continue to cut while I went
out to mow and they were doing the harp
solos the harp solo the hard part from
Angeline was was cut then and we were
listening back and they heard the
lawnmower and they just thought it was
hilarious so they left it in so that&#39;s
that story and we made records every day
of the week seven days a week 12 15
hours a day and long about this time of
day or maybe on toward evening a little
bit more
get tired of hearing whatever it was no
matter how good it was and I&#39;d go for a
run I love to run on the river so one
day I went out for a run and there was
construction out there they were mowing
construction can&#39;t remember exactly what
but I said to myself alright I&#39;ll just
take off that way now I hadn&#39;t been
uptown that long I&#39;d certainly driven
around but I haven&#39;t really walked
around the neighborhood right so here I
am chugging through I&#39;m burning through
that 9-minute mile 2nd Street 3rd Street
4th Street I&#39;m going and the
neighborhood&#39;s changing and I&#39;m still
I&#39;m turning this way I&#39;m going that way
I&#39;m like hmm cool haven&#39;t been here and
I see a group of kids in front of me a
teenage teenage boys and I just spoke a
and I hopped down off the curb and I run
diagonally across I hop up on the other
curb and I just and I&#39;m trotting along
I&#39;m going wow why did I do that why did
I do that um you know did I give up on
me too I give up on them why did I avoid
and right then when I was you know
taking mindil drawing my little bath of
white guilt I hit rabid by what only one
guy in the world calls me Robert Bob
Robert Bob Phil R&amp;B singer
extraordinaire I had just done a record
on him carpenter by day think man if you
go back you think Joe Frazier you think
Mike Tyson this is a mountain of a man
he comes walking off a jobsite and he&#39;s
like what are you doing here Robert Bob
he was doing he was rehabbing a house up
here up about 15 blocks and I said man
I&#39;m just just taking a run he said man
it&#39;s kind of almost dark and woody maybe
not a great idea you know I know this
neighborhood is it anyway how you doing
I&#39;m doing good telling about the studio
and I got into talking to him I said you
know we&#39;ve been here a while we&#39;re
having great success we&#39;re very
fortunate and a group of us who want to
get involved in some community service
some activities maybe some youth
services anyone what what okay
he said just just don&#39;t fall by here and
think it&#39;s gonna be all fun make
yourself feel real good and and do a
little something like that if you&#39;re in
it get in it we knew each other well we
could speak to each other like this and
he said if
want to do community service let me show
you something so we were still within
about a hundred yards of those kids and
he hailed him over those same kids and
he brought him over and they obviously
were responding to Phil Phil was running
the neighborhood and he and he got him
close and he pulled a $20 bill out of
his pocket he ripped it in half and he
handed half of the tough kid up front
and he pulled out his tape measure and
pulled it out like that and he said fine
16 and 7/8 inches get the other half of
the 20 everything changed everything
changed for me too they couldn&#39;t do it
so he slapped a tape measure back in
fetched that twenty back out stuffed in
his pocket he said go home and study and
he looked at me and he said okay if you
want to get if you want to do this let&#39;s
get real and he helped me he introduced
me to people so I put this picture up as
a representation of what was in my mind
at the time these are kids from programs
that we eventually developed they&#39;re not
the kids from that day and and and this
is this pictures mired probably in my
own idea of the deficit that surrounded
and the distance I was from these people
and so you&#39;ll see this picture a couple
times and maybe we&#39;ll all evolve as as I
did meanwhile back at the ranch things
were changing the market said analog
recording was no longer the the the
right thing to do and we had to move to
digital since the binary code and that
of course is me I was scared to death
now here is a guy I was so proud of
myself I could do Paul I could do
something called a window at it that&#39;s
where you take a two-inch tape and you
roll it over on the record head if
there&#39;s one bad note you can identify it
you can physically cut that note out you
can lay it to the side you can go out to
the end of the tape and fetch the right
note back tape it in and nobody knows
seamless editing right I could do it I
understood tape bias
I understood the physics of sound I knew
what a bass trap was right so I could do
all this stuff meanwhile they brought in
a trainee and he goes click copy click
paste
dunh dunh I get my razor blade out and
so you know I got the guys on the line
the engineers are learning this stuff
they&#39;re getting starting to get a coach
we get all kinds of gear right we get
turtlebeach we get Pro Tools we get it
all and they had this piece of gear
called an o2 R from Yamaha which was
meant for old guys like me had an
analogue control surface right and then
had a digital screen and depending what
was on a digital screen the analog
control surface did something different
might be bass might be treble might be
volume might be compression might be
never gonna figure that out was what I
might be right but so they brought in a
special guy to train me and right then
for whatever reason I had the idea it
seemed like the less folks knew about
the old stuff the quicker they got the
new stuff and I just thought to myself
let me go back these people that Phil
had introduced me to and and see if we
could get some the kids from the
neighborhood in you know so the other
thing I felt was devalued at the time
right that my knowledge was devalued I
was mr. poopy pants about that but in
any way at any rate we began to get kids
in from the neighborhood and we started
working with right alongside our
engineers and they were learning just as
fast as the skilled folks who were
trying to forget as much as they were
trying to learn it was really really
exciting it was very fulfilling and the
kids were doing great work but I noticed
that some kids from some neighborhoods
couldn&#39;t come they wouldn&#39;t come I
didn&#39;t know why I was new at this and I
reached out to find out why why aren&#39;t
some kids coming so we engaged a group
of artists and we went to six
neighborhoods around town and we put up
questions and we had artists right and
that facilitated a a dialogue but we had
chalk we had canvas and the kids could
just respond to the questions six
different neighborhoods all the same
questions and we were out there with
with police you know you know in a good
way
neighborhood policing putting up
perimeters if it had been a hot zone so
there was this incredible moment where
this police officer was standing next to
a young person had done this piece and
he&#39;s looking at this drawing of this
place in the city and he&#39;s seen these
lines of demarcation and he said wait a
minute there&#39;s three
these are three neighborhoods here and
the kids said no no it&#39;s for their four
neighborhoods and he took the cop around
back to an alley and he showed him some
new crew symbols and and in that moment
I felt like Here I am that my guys are
all throwing in for a case of diapers
cuz I am mr. poopy pants about my
devalued knowledge but really what we
have here is the police learning from
the kids in the neighborhood that this
sub structure the sub political
structure had changed the control
surface had changed in the neighborhoods
to in a big way and and the knowledge
laid with the kids and it was those kids
so now my opinion like who are these
people you know they&#39;re resilient and
and brilliant and it was it was exciting
for me to evolve through that so here we
go the dancing peas we start with
partnerships the public-private
partnership right and I have written
many of the green peas however they fall
in in the in the mix as an individual a
group gets together loose aggregation of
people till you hit a bump then you form
a formal partnership maybe a nonprofit
agency and you partner up that&#39;s all
good but then sustainability comes in
and we know like right now we don&#39;t have
a budget right there have been times
when it&#39;s been a year without a budget
and you get you get the trust built in
the community and then the bottom falls
out and it&#39;s a real challenge to build
that trust and to abide and stay and as
my friend Phil said don&#39;t fall by here
and get all happy for a minute and then
disappear like everybody else does
all right so I need adentro quo ponics
it changed the game for me I took it
from a private sector I met these
wonderful people sitting in the back of
the room here as you heard it&#39;s it&#39;s a
aquaculture fish hydroponics growing
plants without soil put it together but
there&#39;s a million things people can
learn in these systems building them
conceiving of them drawing them the
engineering the mass plumbing
electricity certainly culinary certainly
agriculture busy
this it&#39;s the future a kid can see her
future in here it&#39;s fantastic and the
data is edible that&#39;s not bad so now we
see the kids again and I&#39;m thinking this
isn&#39;t me doing for two this is with and
the the students had their own idea
their own creativity they brought their
own challenges to the scientists and to
the business people and what we began to
do is do a piece of our own R&amp;D a piece
of our own research a piece of our
product development across an actual
problem in a community what&#39;s the
problem food desert what&#39;s the problem
lack of an lack of knowledge about look
there&#39;s 7,200 plumbing jobs open in the
region and nobody&#39;s trained for plumbing
you see what I&#39;m saying
so you do your R&amp;D you do if we get new
filtration system if the scientist says
we need to change the water temperature
whatever it is you bake that into the
education day with excellent educators
like you can find right there in the
back of the room and things begin to
sing that Rd that testing done over
across the real community problem really
works the company gets what they need
you bring along that nonprofit technique
of grants you bring along sponsorship so
you bring the modalities of the
nonprofit service model right into the
private sector and it really does start
to work oops so here comes 2.0 here you
see CEOs CEOs of companies with new
technologies that are gonna come in and
and take this mantle and work in their
communities do their R&amp;D do their
planning as a piece of of what they need
to do as a company but as a piece of
community service and involve young
people as they go I think is David here
is he still here anyway one of our
sponsors is one of the people so I want
to thank him
[Applause]
so what would you ask a kid what would
you say to a kid like that you say hey
what would look at this technology I
have how can it solve a problem that you
face every day and can you teach me can
you teach me the business person how to
integrate what I&#39;m doing so here they
are again and cross the street kids
right when I met them I crossed the
street I had to come to terms with that
was not proud of myself I had to pick my
own ego up off the mat and learn from
the students learn from the young people
in the towns up and down the river here
when I first saw my cross the street but
now people cross street they cross
towns they go from this state to that
state they cross oceans now people from
12 nations have come to see what these
kids know how to do I&#39;d like you to meet
them I&#39;m not sure I can start the video
Atika in Thai hello my name is Atacama
thank you for supporting to school to
table program and giving me the
opportunity to work with such an amazing
system and working with all these fellow
students as a future scientist this
program would definitely help improve my
communication and critical thinking
skills that I will bring to the
laboratory in the future thank you my
name is ty rich McClendon and thank you
for supporting a great house my favorite
thing this summer was taking care of the
fish and the plants and absorb them now
and seeing how to take care of things
like pests and what happens when they
have deficiencies in iron deficiency and
what I can take away from this is how to
talk to people so that helped me come on
Michelle
[Applause]
thank you
you
