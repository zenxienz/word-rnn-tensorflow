before I fact I&#39;m very particular about
memories memories are very important to
me
I notices and to also ease the tension I
want to take a picture so
[Laughter]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay so I am here to talk about that
won&#39;t we
reaches building grief and not words you
know when the topic came to me I had
several things in my head
Who am I talking to and what am I
talking about how do I get this message
across to everyone sitting here and not
be stereotyped in you know this is what
you have to do this is what I think most
of the people here have heard it all but
I there is one particular thing I would
like to talk about switches your mind
says a lot of people don&#39;t talk about
the mindset and the mindset is extremely
important it is the first drive most
times and whenever I have two people
whenever I have speaks people I always
like to use life references so for
instance I am also a power biker I ride
my bike and if you are right in and
you&#39;re looking at a certain direction
the moment you get distracted or
wherever you&#39;re looking at that is where
your bike is moving to so even if you
have the mindset to write or you have it
in your mind to write streets the moment
you get distracted and you look at that
direction that is where your bike will
tilt to and that is why even when you go
through your writing classes they will
tell you that you need to concentrate
you need to stay focused and when you
wake up in the morning to get yourself
together to think of what you have to do
what are you thinking about it is very
very important your mindset is your
drive is the direction at which you&#39;re
looking at so no matter how much you put
yourself together gather all these
things and you don&#39;t have the right
mindset everything we have learnt here
today is voyage I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m
making sense at all so secondly we need
to discover the problem
you need to ask yourself the questions
don&#39;t you use y4y what pose am i doing
this thing it is very very important
that you ask yourself questions because
I believe that in every society in every
community there is a problem and I
believe that we are problem solvers I
believe that we can discover the
problems within ourselves and we can put
ourselves together I know a lot of
people when we do things we think about
ourselves but I tell you that there is
no business that stands on its own if
you do not and one of the points I
jotted down was being true to yourself
as much as we have the right mindset or
we want to have the right mindset and we
want to dream big we need to be
realistic in our dreams you cannot sit
down and dream of having I don&#39;t even
know the right illustrations you use but
you need to have the right dreams you as
much as we want to achieve so much in
life and as much as we want to we want
to be great leaders we want to have a
better community we need to be realistic
with what we are aspiring to do and we
need to work towards that and am I
making sense at all to anybody here I
would like to have an interactive class
with people whenever I have to start to
speak to people I like to ask you know
if I&#39;m ministering to you if I&#39;m talking
to you even passing on a message we are
not just here to speak I&#39;m here to
inspire and to make sure that and hope
that whatever you have learned from what
I have said here you know it&#39;s goes to
the next level now another thing we need
as a business enterpreneur a lot of
people are here and a lot of people
don&#39;t have business plan and then you
aspire you bringing your people together
you strategize because you need to plan
yourself that from here in the next five
years what are my experiments be where
do I want to be where is this business
going to go let us be realistic with
what we are doing so in 3-4 years if
nothing has happened I&#39;ve been an
entrepreneur for about 10 years so if
this and this hasn&#39;t happened in the
next you need to failures into my plan
when there is something wrong and there
is nothing wrong with starting all over
again a lot of times people tell us
Jimmy do this do that but they never
tell us the truth on how on ezg journey
will be and for every time we want to
give up you need to remember that you
have to give yourself another try
you need to make sure that you give
yourself another try and most times this
is not all about yourself
it&#39;s about you your community
it goes beyond yourself I have ADD let
me try as much as I can to keep myself
out of the picture but most companies
today yes good companies today most
strong companies most lasting companies
today have their chain of production so
you can&#39;t do it all by yourself it is
okay if you have an idea and it is also
okay for you to bring in more people to
walk this thing together it doesn&#39;t just
have to be about you
how are you helping the next person have
you said to yourself that you&#39;re going
to create unemployment yeah a lot of
ladies out there on the streets who
don&#39;t have work to do they come by you
buy your cars and you beg some calm they
wash your windscreen there are
opportunities for these girls you can
teach them how to be beat us you can
teach them how to sue and these people
can work as intense under you so when
you produce a sheds ad
it helps you to produce three shirts a
day and at the end of the day you are
not just helping the next person who is
looking up to you
we are also been you are also extending
labor around you I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m
making sense at all here you also have
talked about time frame when I talked
about the business mind by raising
yourself knowing what she wants to know
ask yourself if you&#39;ve done he was it
was you have plan from now so the next
time you achieve your assertively
setting go from what I talked about that
in each time frame you need
you cancel you are not working because
they just want to feed if it&#39;s by
feeding I will be here today and if it&#39;s
by feeding we can always get food
anywhere if I come to you and I asked
you to give me a plate of food that&#39;s
easy but you need to be invest for every
penny you make you need to understand
that from that daily you can make a
multitude from it is not for you to buy
the next which issue is not for you to
buy the next car yes we want to live a
lottery life but then again investment
is key because you need to understand
that at some point by the time you take
your oranges and you throw the seed away
what happens tomorrow is another day and
a lot of people do not think about
tomorrow they think about the noun and
that also applies to housewives who are
here to be more depending on their
husband I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s about it but
at the same time I&#39;ve always known that
nothing lasts forever and there are
trends where things are very difficult
things get so hard what do you do you
have to be supported to your mind it&#39;s
not the 20,000 area that he gives you
that you put into all the food you need
to also find a way to make sure that you
regenerates that money and be it
supports even in your home so your wing
itself apart from your community is also
a community and it also helps you teach
your children who will become greater
communities in the future don&#39;t be in a
rush it takes time and that is why I
said earlier that nobody told us how
difficult it will be so as much as you
aspire for greatness and aspire to build
bridges and you&#39;ve brought in some
people always remember
proteins that are not everyone so you
need to have that mindset again to
remember that at some points these
people will not be here for you forever
so by the time you are building your
training people always make sure that
you don&#39;t depend on them you also need
to raise more people so that when the
first batch goes are one because
sometimes even in your community you
will spot a bad egg and you need to
uproot that bad egg also you don&#39;t need
to make them feel indispensable because
the moment that person feels
indispensable they feel that they can
just leave at any point so that is very
very key it is extremely key for you to
make sure that you extend hands putting
all do not lose the sauce as much as I
am willing to give it to you to give you
all the knowledge I have there are some
certain things I have to hold back
because I don&#39;t want to a situation
where it&#39;s almost like a competition I&#39;m
not saying that yes you should think
about oh yes I&#39;m a competition and I
want to be the president but at the same
time there should be a little bit of
selfishness and I&#39;m going to be very
honest with you until you&#39;re ready to
retire in that field of what you are
doing
lastly we need to try as much as we can
so big week for ourselves and the people
around us you cannot depend on one
particular theme so I have a clients for
instance who brings the best or the
biggest money to me and because of that
particular clients at that particular
time I have forgotten all the clients he
goes a long way he goes beyond just that
one person that you have met sometimes
you also need to use people to get to
your destination two-way ones will ask
questions they surpass me they asked
with a question of the visual so it is
very very key for you to have your
mentors that you follow and you ask
questions you also do researches I was
given 18 minutes to speak and I guess
enough spoken more than 18 minutes
already I just wrote down points and I&#39;m
believing that these few points that
have we have said or spoken about would
go a long way to building bridges thank
you very much
