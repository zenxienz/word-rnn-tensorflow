very much today 12 speakers will take
this stage each is fighting an epic
battle it&#39;s the battle against fear the
fear of standing here now this is an old
instinct it&#39;s the same one that your
ancestors had when they ran into this
guy the saber-toothed tiger let&#39;s give
this guy a name who&#39;s got a good name
for this saber-tooth Tiger just yell it
out sorry what&#39;s that mr. t miss that is
an excellent name that&#39;s a very creative
name you know when something is about to
rip the meat off your bones it&#39;s nice to
know its name for future reference
so what are my options when I stand out
here well they&#39;re the same ones that
your ancestors had when they ran in to
mr. t I can freeze which is going to
make this a very spooky TED talk or I
can take a flight flight I can run away
or I can fight I can fight but that&#39;s
going to take a lot of courage but if
you have something important to share
with the world and that&#39;s what you have
to do in fact you have to go from stage
fright to stage fight I&#39;ve worked in
communications for many years I&#39;ve
written hundreds of presentations and
speeches for hundreds of speakers and I
can share a few observations about this
stage fight I&#39;d like to share three with
you to start with whoops
to start with when people get on stage
I&#39;m gonna just go back one when people
get on stage they tend to stand wrong
they lock up their knees and that
freezes everything up you don&#39;t want to
lock up your knees you want to bend the
knees
you want to be ready for the ready for
the fight second with the adrenaline
kicking in the breathing gets affected
people breathe high in the lungs they
start breathing fast and that breathing
too shallow you don&#39;t want to do that
you want to breathe deep in your stomach
deep in your stomach like a martial
artist ready for the fight you want to
breathe right for the fight and third
with the knees locking up with breathing
going ballistic that people tend to to
tighten up the shoulders tense the
shoulders that&#39;s no way to give a TED
talk because you want to relax the
shoulders so I&#39;ve come up with a tool
for this and I want to share that tool
with you and it&#39;s called unfreeze the
knees do you like it sketchy huh okay
here&#39;s how it works when I walk out on
stage and I feel everything going
ballistic I just say unfreeze the knees
I feel much better but this works on
stage but it also works off stage for
instance I&#39;m from the states I go back
to the states quite often I go to family
gatherings my Uncle Tom is there you
know and he sees where he&#39;s there and
he&#39;s telling everybody how we&#39;re gonna
make America great again and I&#39;m think
I&#39;ll not that again unfreeze the knees
and I can then I can even deal with
Uncle Tom it&#39;s that powerful so you know
I want to share this with you and this
is a fantastic opportunity we have like
700 people here and I want the best way
to learn something we heard that from
rude earlier today from root is to
experience it so I&#39;d like to ask you all
to stand up would you do that
and you&#39;re gonna I want you to
experience the power of this because
what you&#39;re going to experience is how
to start with how easy it is unfreeze
the knees do it yeah you feel it you
feel that and and to really feel that
you got to get a little bounce going
okay cuz bouncing is fine right yeah and
you can bounce to your rights bounced
you&#39;re right a little bit bounce to the
right to the right and bounce to the
left to the sir careful not what&#39;s
safety first okay thank you okay
but just bounce a little bit now hold
that position okay hold that position
you&#39;re standing right you&#39;re breathing
right your shoulders are relaxed that&#39;s
the unfreeze the knees position we&#39;re
going to simulate two situations first
situation on stage you are standing be
imagine this you are standing behind
that curtain imagine it I was just there
it&#39;s scary it&#39;s very scary but so think
about that you&#39;re back there it&#39;s lonely
it&#39;s scary but all of a sudden you hear
high so Martina announce your name
you walk out imagine that you&#39;re walking
out you come out here you stand here you
look at five six seven hundred mr. T&#39;s
can you feel it yeah so do it when these
freeze up the knees freeze up through
the breathing freeze up the shoulders
would just say unfreeze the knees feel
it it&#39;s good and I promise you take it
with you but now we&#39;re gonna do it
offstage and I need to set this up
offstage because here it is I love the
touch I I really loved the Dutch I think
you guys are great but there&#39;s something
you&#39;re really bad at you are really bad
at standing in line it you are it&#39;s it
doesn&#39;t work for you it&#39;s something
really it&#39;s very stressful for you so so
we&#39;re going to simulate standing in line
okay and to do that of course I want
everybody to turn to their left okay
turn to your left you get to get the
feeling huh so yeah imagine this you&#39;re
at the growth the grocery store you got
your Kino or your yogurt or whatever it
is you know and you&#39;re feeling good you
come around the corner and oMG it&#39;s the
biggest line you&#39;ve ever seen do you
feel that feel the test tighten up the
knees tighten up the breathing does it
and now say it out loud unfreeze the
knees yeah now you feel that feel the
power do it next time for doing
something slightly silly but potentially
valuable give yourself a round of
applause please
yeah
have a seat by the way have a seat um
geez can&#39;t stand like that forever yeah
these are what I call Ted tools for life
Ted tools for life you had it on stage
and off tools for success now I that
took a while but I have three more I
want to share it&#39;ll go much faster three
more I want to share and then I want to
end with a big idea okay so here is the
is that clear
three more big idea okay tool number one
manage audience expectations you know
where we&#39;re going right now right we got
this tool to to go Howard&#39;s off next
speaker thank goodness right so that&#39;s
great but man here&#39;s the power about
managing expectations and and you should
man it when you&#39;re in meetings when
you&#39;re in meetings with colleagues or
customers or client classmates manage
expectations when you&#39;re talking about
your projects because what&#39;s the power
of that it means you&#39;re taking the lead
you&#39;re looking very carefully yet you&#39;re
focusing on how do I manage this how do
I take the next steps how do I share my
ideas sell my ideas how do i generate
enthusiasm for what I&#39;m trying to
generate enthusiasm for and build
something good together manage
expectations audiences love it and you
will get better results now the second
top the second tool just take a little
drink here the second tool before I do
it I need to say this
I think you guys are great I do you know
you could be anywhere today but but you
want to be here because you know
something good is happening here you
know people are doing good things about
dealing with the the the situations of
refugees looking at how to make
drinkable rivers how to get more women
in science you choose to be here because
you know good things are happening I
mean you&#39;re obviously smart creative
forward-thinking I think you guys are
cool so I just want to say that Ted tool
number two always complement the
audience always complimentary right and
how did it feel when I said that how&#39;d
it feel felt good right yeah and I mean
it felt good because I meant it but it
felt but it&#39;s true and compliments
connect when you give people a
compliment and commit to a compliment
you connect with them and people are
connecting build things better together
and you know even more powerful I think
is when you commit to a compliment you
have an assignment for yourself you&#39;ve
given yourself the assignment to look
for the positive in things so powerful
you know we are so good at looking
what&#39;s wrong and wanting to fix that and
focusing on that but when you commit to
a compliment you&#39;re focusing on what&#39;s
good and how to build on that energy so
in that meeting with the colleague the
classmate when you&#39;re getting feedback
back and maybe you don&#39;t even maybe it&#39;s
not the nicest feedback but commit to
that compliment what&#39;s good in that and
and compliment that colleague for giving
you that and then focus on how you can
get value out of that and build things
together so number two number three now
by the way it complements really work
they I use them all the time they work
my colleagues know that and they&#39;re all
they&#39;re all looking kind of funny right
now it means I don&#39;t blame them tool
number three it&#39;s easy you do it all the
time smile okay just just bringing the
word up I see people smiling yeah it&#39;s
great when you smile you actually
activate chemicals in your brain that
relax you and that&#39;s important for
connecting with people when you smile
you are
Seve as being more relaxed more reliable
more attractive studies prove this smile
is so easy and so powerful and smiles
are contagious when you smile people
around you smile so we&#39;re going to do
something actually quite we&#39;re gonna do
something unique here so amazing we are
going to have the biggest collective
smile in Venlo today and it&#39;s going to
happen here at TEDx Venlo it&#39;s it&#39;s
gonna be great you know so um and
actually we&#39;re it&#39;s gonna be so good
that we are going to get Patrick the
photographer he&#39;s gonna capture this
where&#39;s Patrick give Patrick round of
applause yeah one of one of the best
photographers at TEDx Venlo okay so he
is say so okay when I say smile it&#39;s
gonna feel a little bit like a picnic
and picture but when I say smile you
smile biggest collective of smiling
ready smile smile
yeah it&#39;s good I feel relaxed okay yeah
you got it yeah let&#39;s let&#39;s make a
selfie out of it pet can we make a
selfie out of that okay smile
yeah now you know one more little extras
Thank You Patrick
all right just to make it a little more
intense make it a little more intense
look at someone left or right doesn&#39;t
matter do both maybe look him right in
the eye and smile smile it&#39;s nice huh
yeah see how attractive they are CEO
good sir don&#39;t let sir do not look at
her like that that is a little spooky
okay but it&#39;s a little creepy actually
but there it is smile some that&#39;s the
three although I see I see a few of you
I see a few of you you&#39;re thinking I see
it you&#39;re thinking yeah there&#39;s nothing
worse than a fake smile and I see it
yours but you&#39;re you&#39;re right you&#39;re
such a smart audience it&#39;s amazing so um
and that brings me to this the big idea
this is a Lisa
hey Lisa I was a speaker at TEDx Venlo
last year she was a Syrian refugee
she came on stage to tell about her
journey to Venlo
here you see her she looks poised
confident she&#39;s fantastic but like many
speakers like many speakers a Lisa was
terrified she was terrified of being on
this stage but she did not let that fear
stop her because she was on a mission
she was on a mission to do something
good to tell a story she felt had to be
told a mission to do something good and
to me that is the big idea I&#39;d like to
end with focus on the good that&#39;s the
most powerful tool on stage and off than
you can have now here&#39;s my personal
philosophy be strong do good you know I
I can tell you it&#39;s pretty scary behind
that that stage back there behind that
curtain but I&#39;m pretty sure that by
doing this I&#39;ll be a better coach for
the Ted speakers down the road and those
speakers as you know are focused on
doing something good and that gives you
strength I&#39;ve I&#39;ve worked with hundreds
of speakers many of them say how do I
manage the fright a stage fright and the
answer is do not focus on the fright
focus on the fight the fight to do
something good that&#39;s where you will
find strength fear will always feel real
but when you focus on the good you get
the courage to get unreal and when you
focus on the good your smile will be
authentic your compliment will be
genuine it will I promise
so those are the Ted tools for life that
I wanted to share the next time you run
into all those mr. T&#39;s out there whether
it&#39;s a one or a thousand doesn&#39;t matter
unfreeze the knees manage expectations
smile you know how to do it we did it
right smile I want to thank you for
being a smart creative fantastic amazing
TEDx van Lowe audience be strong and
you&#39;re good
[Applause]
