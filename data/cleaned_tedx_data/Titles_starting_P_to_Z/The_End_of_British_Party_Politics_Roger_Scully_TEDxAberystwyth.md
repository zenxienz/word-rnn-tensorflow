it was the last election broadcast
before the 2017 general election it&#39;s
one of the final chances for the party
predicts cases for voters unsurprisingly
the party made prominent use its leader
confounding many expectations he had
proven an effective campaigner over the
past few weeks Paulson showed his
popularity rising consistently since
Teresa may have caught the snap election
the leader had defied his critics he&#39;d
been front and center of the campaign
and the rising improving poll ratings
his party suggested that his leadership
worked indeed when the final result a
few days later turned out even better
for his party than the polls have
suggested this was seen as very much a
personal victory and he emerged a
greatly strengthened vigor those both
inside and outside the party who
previously criticized his leadership
either fell silent were publicly voiced
praise loyalty now I&#39;m talking of course
about the leader of the Labor Party
I&#39;m not talking about Remy Corbett I&#39;m
actually referring to the somewhat less
well-known figure certainly outside
Wales look how Windows First Minister
and leader of Welsh Labour now there&#39;s
one small example from the final party
election broadcast by the Labour Party
in Wales
this here is one illustration of a much
broader point elections are about
choices in representative democracy
people get to choose who governs now of
course there&#39;s more to it than that in a
represent of democracy elections have to
be free and fair you can argue about
whom the people are actually defined to
be so who gets to vote
they&#39;re different political systems so
in parliamentary democracies we vote for
members of a legislature which in turn
produces a government in a presidential
system we vote directly for the head of
government there are different electoral
systems which shape how we vote and how
those like to aggregate together into an
election result and of course some very
important and powerful official
positions like membership of
constitutional courts or the leadership
of central banks are not normally
elected but the basic principle remains
in a representative democracy we the
people choose guns
of course we do not as Karl Marx might
have put it make our choices just as we
please choose in election for the menu
and its political parties that provide
the options on that menu democracy in
the UK and pretty much everywhere else
remains a party democracy that is
organized political movements which we
call parties provide the overwhelming
majority of candidates in major
elections and an even greater share of
those who actually win election now of
course we don&#39;t always get the menu of
options that we would like many people
are happy with available choices in many
elections there&#39;s been a big decline in
faith in political parties in over the
last few decades in the UK and in many
other established democracies despite
recent surgeries for the SNP and Labour
Party membership numbers have generally
been falling of recent times and in the
wider electorate we see a similar
picture there were far fewer people have
a deep and abiding loyalty to any
specific political party than used to be
the case then of course unhappiness with
available choices is one reason why many
people simply refuse to vote
yet even when the available choices are
unsatisfactory to many of us this menu
of electoral options that still matters
but the nature of those electoral menus
has changed in a fundamental way the
choices before us in the general
election were once largely common across
Britain but voters in the UK&#39;s Four
Nations are increasingly being presented
with fundamentally different and largely
disconnected sets of political options
we continue to elect one Parliament one
half of Commons when we do so from four
distinct electoral contests a genuinely
British democratic politics is being
hollowed out now why does this matter
well think about what unites a country
we might imagine a common language a
shared religion perhaps a shared sense
of ethnic identity people of Boston also
become more United through facing it
from an enemy but in an important sense
in a democracy people can also be united
by their differences
I thought democracy does not seek to
abolish differences within a society it
merely provides for their peaceful
airing and their resolution via
elections and representative politics we
don&#39;t always get the government or the
policies that we want but we all get the
chance to take part in the process and
that at least may help us accept when we
don&#39;t get what we want to work democracy
ultimately depends on losers
that is the ability of the defeated to
accept both the outcome and the
legitimacy of the process by which it
has been reached but this uniting
through our differences can only occur
if we have some sort of common political
debate and common set of options now we
don&#39;t have that election become
essentially a disconnected set of nearly
coinciding events in different parts of
the country in the worst case scenario
political debates may have so little in
common that the interest of different
parts of the country can see completely
unrelated to each other now this doesn&#39;t
mean of course that we can have no local
differences rural areas will have
different concerns from urban ones rich
areas we tend to worry about different
things from poor places but the health
of a political system does require some
unity political debate of the options
presented to people and the electoral
choices that they make and in the UK
this is under increasing pressure the UK
is becoming an electronic dis United
Kingdom the literal choices have become
increasingly different between the
nations of Britain over the last half
century see the long slow decline slot
of conservatism the rise the SNP and to
a lesser extent like Hungary this
electoral disunity was shown vividly in
2017 for only the second time ever but
also the second time in a row the
general election saw four different
parties come first in the UK&#39;s four
nations prior to 2015 that have never
happened
thought and less widely noticed this
year
what other developments the pushed party
politics in the UK further apart
Northern Ireland of course has long had
a very different politics from the rest
of the UK electorally Ulster has always
been a place of heart yeah 2017 saw
their moderate forces with the closest
links to the main UK party&#39;s lose their
last remaining members of parliament in
Scotland the SNP again won the election
although much less decisively than they
had two years previously but the
unionist parties achieved their house
will come back by essentially fighting
on the SMPS turf albeit with some
success the defining electoral issue in
Scotland with independence and whether
or not there should be a second
independence referendum even those
parties that strongly believe in the
United Kingdom remaining together
thought election campaign had almost no
connection at all there happening in the
rest of the UK Wales offers more subtle
picture than the antha than the other
non-english nations of the UK Wales has
long been very closely tied to its much
larger neighbor to the east but Labour&#39;s
ultimately successful 2017 campaign in
Wales
focus almost entirely on the Welsh
Labour Grant Jeremy Corbyn was almost
invisible in the labour campaign in
Wales excluded in favour of coward votes
and after their disappointing result
many prominent Welsh conservatives
called urgently for greater autonomy for
their party for an identifiable Welsh
leader in other words putting their
party much on the model of Welsh Labour
or indeed the Scottish Conservatives and
the lower-cost England and Britain are
often conflated by the UK&#39;s majority
nation
both the 2015 and the 2017 elections
have reflected the rise in recent years
of a more prominent and more politicized
English identity after the introduction
of English votes for English laws in the
House of Commons in 2015 all parties
this year felt the need to respond to
Englishness as a political phenomenon in
their electoral manifestos the Labour
Party even proposed the introduction of
a minister for England
so 2017 saw politics across the UK&#39;s
four Nations move further apart
something was not just a one-off the
continuation of rather longer-term
trends if you came federal actions
continue on their Tod path as British
fundamental problems for the long-term
unity of the UK clitoral unions are
flat-file things this at least is
something the citizens of the only
member state ever to vote to leave the
European Union to be able to grasp the
existence of the British state is a
contingent fact the British state&#39;s
existence is neither necessary nor
inevitable deed that states history has
been much more turbulent than many
people realize those who emphasize what
Churchill termed the long continuity of
our institutions tend to underplay or
maybe even be unaware of the major
convulsions that have transformed the
fundamental shape of politics in these
islands roughly once a century since the
time of Henry in the eighth
so Henry&#39;s formal incorporation of Wales
into the kingdom of England early in the
sixteenth century was followed the
beginning of the 17th century by the
Union English trans by the formal
parliamentary union Scotland in England
in 1707 an assembly union between
Ireland and Britain in 1800 then of
course in 1922
we saw the independence of 26 of
Ireland&#39;s 32 counties as the Irish Free
State it&#39;s often forgotten that only 95
years ago the UK lost a greater
proportion of its core territory
throughout independence the Germany had
just a few years previously through the
Treaty of Versailles and just three
years ago UK does what was not so much
another bullet as a large piece of
artillery munition when very close to
half of those voting in Scotland opted
for independence the petition history of
what is now the United Kingdom is not
remotely the story of stability
tranquility that many would like to
think the UK may continue to stay
together fragmentation is not inevitable
absence genuinely British party politics
to help tie things together
certainly pushes things is it direction
we could end up not nearly as a
naturally dis United Kingdom the end of
British party politics could well mean
the end
