hello so many years ago before I wanted
to be a writer and director I
desperately wanted to be an actor and I
spent a year auditioning for all of the
London top drama schools and there was a
drama school called Drama Centre which
was my first choice and the morning came
for my audition and I woke up I got
ready I was really nervous really
anxious and excited and I suddenly
realized just before I began to make the
journey that there was a tube strike so
in a sudden panic I called a taxi and
the taxi arrived I got in and as we
pulled out onto a busy High Street I
realized that I didn&#39;t have any cash on
me to pay him so I asked him to stop and
I got out of the taxi stepped into the
road turned my head and saw a van
hurtling towards me at full speed and in
a moment of sheer instinct I threw
myself underneath the van between the
wheels and sort of skidded along the
floor remaining relatively unscathed
compared to what could have happened and
the poor van driver helped me out from
under his van and he was very shaken and
he asked me if I was all right and I you
know my main priority was I have to get
to this audition this is the the
number-one thing on my mind so in that
very British way I thanked him and
profusely apologized saying I&#39;m sorry
I&#39;m a complete idiot
and went to the cash machine got my cash
got back in the cab and we we drove as
fast as he could drive and pulled up
outside the audition and I ran down the
corridor and made it just in time and
then I went in and I did my audition
which was two monologues and that went
fine and then afterwards I sat down to
have an interview with the head of
acting and he said this to me why do you
want to act why do you want to make
theatre and I was completely paralyzed
I was completely flummoxed I had
absolutely no idea what to say I mean I
knew I wanted it so much that I&#39;d risked
my life 30 minutes before but I&#39;d never
really formulated in my mind why I&#39;d
never really asked myself that question
I just did so I kind of mumbled
something lamely about escapism and
entertainment and as I said it it felt
crap
and clearly he wasn&#39;t very impressed
because he just frowned at me through
his glasses and said right and that was
that and this was about ten years ago
and to this day I still ask myself that
question all the time why do I make
theater and I guess the real question is
why is theater important and one of the
answers is clear right now in what we&#39;re
doing I mean I just told you a little
story which is in itself a piece of
theater and when I told it I looked at
you I engaged with you you you may not
have said anything during my story but
your presence here and your
personalities in some way shape the way
I told that story and I could tell it
again at another time another place in
front of another audience and it would
never be as it is today there is
something about live performance that is
unique and I guess we could say that
television and film reach people in
their millions but I think there&#39;s
something passive about watching a
screen and when we&#39;re present at a live
event as an audience we&#39;re active and
engaged and now I guess now that I
understand the value of this amazing
platform theater what do I want to make
theater about I mean what are the
burning things that I feel I need to
share with an audience and here I&#39;m
going to get into some more specifics
about Who I am and what I do as a
theatre maker because with me and this
is what I do the personal is very
political and this for me this
realization was a Eureka moment for me
in my work a realization that my little
stories my subjective take on the world
could in some way serve the bigger
picture and that&#39;s what storytelling is
right
it&#39;s the microcosm the little story
which reflects the macrocosm the bigger
story
so my microcosm I am a transgender man
which for I don&#39;t know some of you may
not know what that means it means I was
born biologically female and I
transitioned three years ago to become a
man and over the last few years in the
last couple of years I made a show in
collaboration with another theatre
company called rum and clay called
testosterone and I use my own
autobiographical experiences in the show
and it&#39;s set in my first moment the
first time that I ever enter a male
changing room and it&#39;s a quest for
masculine identity it&#39;s me trying to
navigate my way through the world of men
and understand where I fit in and the
show poses questions such as when did I
become a man I mean did I become a man
when I first decided I wanted to be one
or was it when I had my first hormone
injection or was it when I was perceived
as a man I mean what is a man I when did
you become a man or a woman I mean that
might seem a really silly question but
actually I think there&#39;s there&#39;s
something very interesting in it did you
become a man or a woman before you were
born or was it when you knew what the
difference between a boy and a girl was
or was it later than that when people
started to treat you in certain ways I
think these are really really important
questions to ask ourselves and the next
question I asked myself when I&#39;m making
a piece of work is why now why why is it
important to tell this story now how do
i contextualize it and the answer with
this piece of work was that we are now
having a conversation about gender and
identity more than ever I&#39;m sure lots of
you read about the recent Harvey
Weinstein allegations and how that&#39;s led
to story after story coming out
about male domination about men abusing
their power they&#39;re placed in a very
patriarchal system and sort of reigning
over other people and you know this this
subject seemed to me ripe to make a
piece of work about and so I asked
myself what does my little story what
how does it serve this this larger issue
of identity and the answer was that I
guess I&#39;m in a unique position
I have lived as both a man and a woman
and I&#39;ve experienced firsthand the
differences between them and I guess I
can say with some authority that I don&#39;t
know as a man I feel safer when I walk
down a street at night I also feel that
when I&#39;m talking to someone on the phone
in a kind of formal capacity that I&#39;m
taken more seriously I mean that&#39;s
ridiculous that shouldn&#39;t be the case
but in my experience it is and I also
noticed negative things so for example I
was coming back from from a holiday a
couple of years ago and I&#39;d lived as a
man for about a year at that point and I
had a fight with a flight attendant
during the flight and for some reason I
must have been feeling very vulnerable
or something I don&#39;t know I burst out
crying after we had this argument and it
was very embarrassing and we were all
disembarking the plane and I was kind of
I&#39;m sure you know you may at some point
in your lives have cried in this way
where you&#39;re kind of uncontrollably
sobbing like a child and I was just
going and the other passengers of course
noticed me uncontrollably sobbing and
nobody did anything
nobody said are you okay or offered me a
tissue and I realized then in that
moment that it&#39;s beamed unnatural and
inappropriate for men to cry and things
like hugging I&#39;ve had to sort of adapt
the way that I now hug my male friends
there&#39;s a sort of unspoken rule that we
kind of hold each other at arm&#39;s
length and we have this very kind of you
know mechanical pat on the back and then
we disengage from each other you know
which is all very strange and then I
started looking into statistics and
found out that two-thirds of the world&#39;s
suicides are done by men and surely men
are not born biologically predisposed to
be more suicidal than women clearly it&#39;s
a cultural thing right and you know of
course in my work and in my transition I
explored and experienced many you know
incredibly positive things about
masculinity and you know very touching
things like the arenas in which a man
can be emotional and can be tactile like
sport for instance but I felt that if I
could use my little stories to somehow I
don&#39;t know shed some light on this
bigger issue of identity then I was
doing something right now I guess I
bring myself back to the question I
asked myself at the beginning why do I
make theater and I guess I make it
because I want to honor to celebrate to
defy to challenge and all manner of
other verbs but if I have to bring it
down to one it&#39;s most importantly to
question and theater is my medium to do
this and of course it may not be yours
but if I can leave you with one thing
today I would urge you through whatever
means whether it&#39;s science geography
history politics music whatever ask
questions ask questions of yourself and
of the world around you because
questions open us up to a discourse they
allow us to you know to to admit that we
might not know all the answers and they
take us sometimes somewhere really
interesting and questions allow us to
look at ourselves our little stories our
identities and kind of understand how
they impact the greater world
so thank you very much
[Applause]
