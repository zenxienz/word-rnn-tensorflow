so before we get into this thing called
self-sustaining training we all snooze
to spend a few moments give you a little
idea of what I&#39;d like to share with you
today
see I don&#39;t know whether you are
subpoena by training with you at
entering sessions lessons lectures
briefings conferences but pretty much
most of us at some point during our
professional lives or personal lives
have to share ideas what&#39;s all of that
we have to learn from people be able to
teach people and what I want to do is to
share some ways to be to delay that
uncle in self-sustaining training that I
think will make it better and better
more effective already more useful
something I&#39;m really excited about
something I&#39;m really passionate again a
little rebellion little revolution if
you like
so today whether this is life for you or
with you watching this on video I get to
invite you to join the revolution that&#39;s
the plan now fully get started do you
know everybody else here that&#39;s the
interactive session thank you for that
yeah good okay so we&#39;ll do a very quick
round of introductions this shouldn&#39;t
take us too long what I&#39;m thinking is
just once the time if you stand up say
who you are way from the next up as a
person you married boyfriends
girlfriends shut the photos on your
device the best helps a person your best
for like the worst are they three things
about you that&#39;s true and one that&#39;s
false
go directly so wraps a neck lights
moment down plus if you&#39;ve ever bill I
need that kind of training session they
often start with something like that
don&#39;t they know I did when you start out
start talking about yourself which will
be fascinating and listening with you
cos you sir
interesting life to share but no one&#39;s
listening no no reflection because all
anybody&#39;s thinking is what do I say
about myself how long do I talk for and
it moves ever closer to you like
creeping death what&#39;s the back there the
corner Tom yeah what&#39;s 22 Tom went by
now fond on cares because again that
launched to share but we don&#39;t think it
why I planned this it&#39;s just an awful if
you&#39;ve ever been invited ever worked to
action to do that exercise find
something you don&#39;t know tell them
something about you that nobody else
knows if nobody knows it there&#39;s a very
good reason
keep it to yourself is the only
interesting things that I&#39;ve you
delivering training for about 20 years
and I&#39;ve never really found anybody but
all three people that like that
activities stand up introduce yourself
and it starts the session in quite
distressing way it&#39;s not a good living
way in fact it&#39;s a bit like if I think
of all the places I&#39;ve worked I want to
learn the UK Europe well two leads to
West Coast America different countries
in Africa I&#39;ve worked in Far East and
pretty much is much writing pretty much
delegates are training courses or
conferences can be divided into three
types now I&#39;m not saying for example in
the world I&#39;d be ridiculous
but anything like three types of people
when it comes to conference in the mixed
labels I mean say this kind of make
sense to you
so the first third person you find at
the conference is what I&#39;d like to call
the enthusiast you know the enthusiastic
kind of quite that let me go there&#39;s one
make it quite rare often but you know
using assets they don&#39;t necessarily
agree with everything that&#39;s being said
but they like to fully engage they like
to challenge the ideas like to see how
it&#39;s going now in conference situations
and work situations you don&#39;t
it&#39;s the second time it&#39;s what I like to
call the holidaymaker a holiday makers
are far more common in the workplace
these are people who think it&#39;s chance
together the time away from work they
might need cup of coffee the misc is
involved and it&#39;s not maturity to sit
next to something you find physically
attractive the problem of course
sometimes with prisoner calling lateness
is that God okay was okay but then when
asked to do something you don&#39;t wanna do
to the work you don&#39;t switch off a
little bit or maybe instead it&#39;s a lot
of Fairweather deafness and then there&#39;s
a third type of Delegates potentially my
favorite actually what I like to call
the prisoner now we&#39;ve all seen your
prisoner arrive at a conference session
or a track session this is the person
who arrives slightly late on purpose and
just to let you know that they&#39;re not
really that interested there&#39;s somebody
who sits there with their arms folded by
the way your oxen it&#39;s just comfortable
okay but you know now they can&#39;t declare
at you with a special kind of
malevolence mister let you know that not
only you saying stuff they don&#39;t agree
with but they don&#39;t prove with you as a
person most of us have seen this kind of
birds that live in Dear John now
statistically every organization in the
world has been proven out sometime again
corporates public bodies blood companies
small companies every team every
department every sector has at least one
super prisoner now super rich there is
somebody who adopts this method of
learning all the time highly skeptical
highly negative they put out of line the
face like a slapped back sighs you know
the type of person and by the way it&#39;s
lost out there right now think again
I&#39;ll tell Graham we don&#39;t have any
it&#39;s you an interesting thing a lot of
trainers that I&#39;ve worked with over over
the last 40 years since but all their
attention folks of whites working on
working on those learners on those
audience members and don&#39;t be wrong but
I think they caught things as a two way
process subtle hints but lots of web
trends I think they&#39;re wrong as they
tend to focus too much on that different
main audience you probably go to
trailers go yes a really great session
the audience was up for it or it&#39;s a
really tough session of a bunch of
Chris&#39;s in there and I think that&#39;s the
wrong focus see I think training needs
to be three key things by training them
in theories conferences lessons
briefings anytime you to share some
ideas I think all training sessions
should be absolutely compelling
I think should want a cue around the
block to get involved and it doesn&#39;t
matter what the topic is people make
excuses works health and safety I don&#39;t
know interesting character says who
oh it&#39;s a job the basics for managers
okay I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good enough
excuse I think we should find ways to
make training and learning compelling
for everybody unwise won&#39;t think about
they Valentimes come along secondly the
training must be useful so it has to
absolutely be useful because otherwise
what I think they&#39;ll do then trainers
have this habits all the time of
thinking of showing you a useful theory
and you kind of get it by osmosis
no you won&#39;t because you don&#39;t care
because it&#39;s not your key thing it&#39;s not
your topic
the third thing all training has got to
have some absolute value I believe to
the business to the organization
somebody has to pay for
have to come from somewhere so these
three key things are three key
fundamentals main tenets of training
learning briefing conferences that I&#39;ve
always tried to apply until recently
I&#39;ve pretty much always thought about it
right but a few months ago see several
months ago
I love those kind of moments that
challenge that I think that that&#39;s in a
moment because that forms the basis of
self-sustaining training because this is
what most people do when they start to
think about a training session so that&#39;s
something else to come along and teach
in coaching
so this is what most people tend to do
you only coach the prayer together
what is all the stuff I know about
coaching so you&#39;ll come up with a bunch
of topics like Elenita coaching model
grow that&#39;s always good as if you don&#39;t
grow see some of you do some see the
horror in your eyes the thousand-yard
stare and we need some kind of thing
like to do with the emotions as people
get emotional women in coach thought
what else we&#39;re going to teach them all
open questions that&#39;s going to end so it
goes on and what you do what you topics
you then create a list of slides and you
PowerPoint people to death
you probably experiences occasions
people get driven by the PowerPoint let
you stand there going you know anything
short of time I&#39;ll just show you a bunch
of slides and oh you won&#39;t have time to
read these and I&#39;ll go just quickly told
that some of it sticks and the problem
is most of us know this doesn&#39;t work
it&#39;s pretty clear doesn&#39;t work but a lot
of people still persist in trying to
teach a room from people by showing them
lots of slides and making the ring slide
after slide after slide and there&#39;s an
issue with this it&#39;s never really worked
but I think it&#39;s absolutely not worked
even more in the last five years this is
like epiphany moments I have and I&#39;ll
tell you exactly what happens I&#39;m
speaking to event about 500 people in
Birmingham and there was a really good
atmosphere there&#39;s a lot of people
interested but on that road of somebody
who&#39;s constantly using
our firm there are slightly throw boats
because I have to tell you a very
compelling speaker does it case you
haven&#39;t noticed and I&#39;m not used to
happening but I&#39;m a little bit thrown
anyway if you think end it and certainly
okay Michael says the nice things on one
of them was this person this phone as
I&#39;m going to ask you what what was the
deal with the phone I stole yeah quite a
few of my colleagues couldn&#39;t make it so
what we were doing was sending your key
messages so how to follow us we were
taking photos in your slides and sharing
them we&#39;re filming this bits of what you
were doing and passing on to other
people and I had one of those on my
nervous moments the only way that they
smoke being that those devices that most
of us have got these days can access the
world of information it doesn&#39;t matter
what battle of Lumia videos or
animations or theories or forums or
discussion points or anything it&#39;s all
there available now I&#39;m not by the way
arguing that we want people to get
anything online but we should
I&#39;m also to argue that you get rid of
life speaking because we should have
more life speaking my argument is we
have to stop having more of everything
all of the time in learning and we have
to completely fundamentally events
simply redesign the way we do training
coaching and briefing that&#39;s what I want
to share with you right now that&#39;s the
process that I want to show you that
absolutely makes the massive massive
difference so the first thing in any
point when you&#39;re going to plan any
sharing information you have to ask
yourself why am I going to do this now
this seems like a very simple question
you know so training needs analysis is
NIC right don&#39;t go that and I get that
but unfortunately a lot of why isn&#39;t as
clear as it should be so while he goes
throughout this session I have quite a
little time you say well we&#39;ve always
done it I&#39;ve always done what I&#39;ve
clients go well my boss has told me we
need to get more of a coaching
so we go to teach coaching or it&#39;s just
that what is latest thing so we actually
need to start with I suggest a really
useful question which is this what as a
result of this training do you work of
telling us thinking saying and doing and
this is a better version of why do you
want to do it and think say and do I&#39;ve
consistently found gives you a better
reason and better planning for the
century that the situation the session
if you&#39;re planning because I think the
countries on we had earlier so you want
to do coaching some wine what you want
the delegates thinking as you&#39;re
actually talking well it&#39;s think malice
you want to agree that this is working
you want to agree that management just
by 10 P versus chronic might be you want
to start to think all this could work
better what you want to plead what you
wanted to say how you remove this from
just thinking it started talking places
and then crucially how do you move them
thinking this and saying it to doing
something with it 24 to 48 hours after
most training sessions 90% plus of what
you versus be forgotten because there&#39;s
not enough plan from doing it thinking
it&#39;s saying it to actually then take it
back to the workplace we have to start
fundamentally redesigning wine we really
need to a big room sitting down telling
stuff so I want you fundamentally to
consider using is if you have to do any
kind of Theory any discussion any
briefing even training Andy teaching are
we to answer this is a model because I&#39;m
extensively protesting this and it
absolutely works I want to stop
considering what is the return on
investments but you&#39;re looking to get
from this session that you&#39;re going to
run people will often say you can&#39;t
predict own investments on soft skills
so why are you doing this I own these
big lessons many years ago at Isis
that&#39;s made why are we hiring you in for
this session I said are these really
good useful great sponsor feedback -
yeah I mean all of that pertain to the
pub so I&#39;m gonna chamber are the great
thing that I want to know what I&#39;m you
to gain from
situation the second question is what
there are actually two watts so the
first water looks a lot like the country
mr. watt so what is it you&#39;re going to
show them the catchy acronym for example
the other questions the rapport all
those sorts of areas that&#39;s what you&#39;re
going to tell them but then there&#39;s a
second what and this is the so what so
what do you want to do with all of that
so often I see trainers and I see people
brief in a roomful of people saying this
is that you process and hoping that you
make the link you&#39;ve got to do the new
process and not working out but there
will be some problems with the new
process but should be in the so walks
sighs so some website for coaching
market a bit like that in other words
I&#39;m going to teach you how to do the
grown country model what does the own
stamp when they broke up some of those
of you look at that being that you use
it reformers option two days now the
problems you have you teach people
coaching as you say what your options
are then the I know it&#39;s got no idea
your religion you tell me so yeah I&#39;ll
tell you there and now we&#39;re not
coaching anymore
now instead what we do is tell you what
to do so one of the so wants questions
is what you do when we do that we might
think about emotion being something that
happens in coaching so therefore what do
we do if somebody bursts into tears and
you can see on you
between so was and why we&#39;re getting
really close link why are you doing this
coaching program what&#39;s your cell
investment measures so what are you
going to show them and what do they do
with it there&#39;s a massively tight link
between those two items there and then
and only then gonna get to the third
part the third part is that how we
actually going to do this now anybody
multi training gets a bit excited by the
how a bit because of how this is the
shiny sexy bits I don&#39;t if I&#39;m gonna
have to say sexy in a textbook I&#39;ve
never said it twice
oh there we go so that how is the
Scheinman that everybody gets really
excited about so what&#39;s the new thing
like a trade show
people who buy trailers come up to me so
what&#39;s new what could hear it was new
what&#39;s the greatest newest pretty
fatness psychrometric do we have things
people speaking and doing it videos is
it streamable under my arms but it&#39;s the
wrong way around we need to start with
why what so what and then we get to have
like I said to you I think any of these
howls are absolutely possible so I think
we should have life speaking and I think
we should get things being involved I
think the shooting use video we should
have animation and theories models but
we need to move away from this idea that
too many trailers still haven&#39;t as I
have all of the secrets in my training
mangle hair due to certain age selling
but don&#39;t read ahead even though you can
flip open your device and get all the
answers and better answers from more
qualified people in a split seconds
we&#39;ve got these devices we should use
them why don&#39;t we start sending theories
to people before they come onto the
course why don&#39;t we make this all about
using those theories the why the what
perhap so how now starts to become a far
clearer shape so he starts to realize
we&#39;ve got a really simple diagram here
and what I can tell you from having
wrote s at this particular theory
specifically I&#39;m teaching how to teach
for years but been using this several
months now that we&#39;re at the variety of
groups like insists that got great
results so with very very new trainers I
have been saying it&#39;s great it&#39;s a
really really simple process start with
why why are you going to do this what
are you going to tell them what do they
do with it make sure those to line up
and then we want to have how eager to
bring all of that to life and what I&#39;ve
noticed is that that how now you get far
less frivolous nonsense that sometimes
happens in training if there are
thoughts of necessary spending time on
these bits because you&#39;re making sure
that the how probably works with what
and the why so I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve been new
trainers I try to do experience training
JD&#39;s and fascinating you able to take
you know all this things like that let&#39;s
clear out the room and introduce
ourselves we&#39;ve revised us a pretty
certain purpose anymore what gets rid of
it I also tried this with very senior
board members I&#39;d only ever been to a
board meeting very accurately titled but
I&#39;ve worked with people who have sets
made you know we do this thing we get
everybody together every quarter 500
members of staff we do that&#39;s how all we
tell them all this stuff and actually
now it works rap a little we have no
idea why we&#39;re doing it it costs a huge
amount of time they ignored that amount
of money that seems to achieve very
little this give us a chance to rethink
that so as we start to bring this to an
end that model there that theory I&#39;m
going to urge you to consider give years
ago it absolutely works and it makes any
kind of briefing or training or less
total teaching a considerably better and
more powerful that more effective
process for now I really hope you
enjoyed the session more importantly
I&#39;ve got something useful from a session
I&#39;ll urge you to join the training
rebellion I look for to be to be the
future and hearing more about your
training and learning successes thank
you
