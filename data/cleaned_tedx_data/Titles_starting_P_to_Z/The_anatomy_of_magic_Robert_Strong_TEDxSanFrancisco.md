hello I didn&#39;t see you there
I&#39;m magician Robert strong and I&#39;m going
to share with you the anatomy of a magic
trick now all magic tricks have five
parts first the assumption I understand
the assumptions you&#39;ll make about an art
pad that it is flat has many pages and
weighs about two pounds next I know the
assumptions you&#39;ll make about in magic
marker it has a cap ink and has a strong
smell together I know the assumptions
you&#39;d expect that a marker would do to
an art pad it would leave a few marks
maybe even a circle now the third part
is the conceal I hide the secret in
plain sight the fourth part is the
reinforce I strengthen the incorrect
story that you create in your mind the
fifth and final part is the magic that
is the moment when your brain struggles
with the wrong assumptions and the new
reality that is revealed
[Music]
that was awesome when that bowling ball
hit the ground you jumped out of your
seat just a little now for those of you
who are paying very close attention I
only listed four the five parts I left
out the very top secret misdirect which
I&#39;ll get to in precisely 60 seconds so
the first slide we&#39;re going to talk
about our assumptions your brain is very
powerful and it&#39;s constantly making
assumptions about the world around you
it does that through millions of years
of evolution your instincts are very
strong you don&#39;t have to test every step
you take before you take the step to
confirm that the grounds gonna hold your
weight and don&#39;t reach out to people and
grab them and touch their body parts and
make sure that all I don&#39;t know real
body parts not fake body parts that be
awkward I&#39;m so magicians exploit these
assumptions these instincts to create
illusions tricks
now speaking of assumptions you probably
all have already made a few assumptions
today for example these glasses are real
and that they have lenses in them but
they don&#39;t
you probably assumed that that watch
that I referred to 60 seconds ago was
not blue painters tape you probably
assumed that this microphone is real and
not be shabari 3000
[Applause]
it&#39;s a spot massager now you can get
overnighted from Amazon for 38 dollars
and 37 cents you probably also assume
that my body parts are real and not fake
body parts made of plastic now the brain
works in mysterious ways now I&#39;ve
scrambled the letters and because the
brain is a program to make sense out of
nonsense to make connections that are
not always necessarily there to kind of
live in the future and predict what
comes next it&#39;s very easy because the
context of TEDx San Francisco you know
that was supposed to say there - no
speaking of predictions you saw in the
front row guy who jumped it what is your
name Patrick I have a prediction a jumbo
plane card over there would you name my
playing card out loud six of diamonds
that&#39;s interesting because on the other
side of this jumbo playing card Patrick
I have the six of diamonds right about
there
now that is an anti-magic trick the
context of seeing a magician you kind of
expected that the six of diamonds would
be the only card on the other side that
wasn&#39;t an amazing magic trick but this
bowling ball that was awesome that was
amazing that trick will get that out of
the way now the next slide we&#39;re going
to talk about is the third part of a
magic trick which is the misdirection
please raise your hand if you can read
the words on this card that&#39;s just about
most of you
now speaking of attention please bring
your attention to the six of diamonds it
is the only one that&#39;s drawn on there
because the other cards are actually
stuck on there let me help
ladies and gentlemen Theron is a great
speaker a great magician and today a
great misdirect Thank You Theron and now
ladies and gentlemen the conceal I won&#39;t
spend a lot of time on this because
magicians hate when you talk about the
conceal in concept it&#39;s the secret of
the magic trick that&#39;s hidden in plain
sight you don&#39;t know to look for it
because you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re
looking for there&#39;s actually a real dog
in the middle of those stuffed animals
and once you see it it&#39;s difficult to
unsee just like when a magician watches
another magicians magic show if he knows
the method it&#39;s really difficult for him
to unsee it and now ladies and gentlemen
the reinforce the reinforce this is
interesting it&#39;s the psychology of magic
it&#39;s when you give what&#39;s called time
misdirection that&#39;s more time and space
from the secret and you also give extra
information that guides you away from
the truth and moves you towards that
that false story that was creating the
brain like when I wrote the words
bowling ball on the artpad that kind of
read it it reinforced that it was a real
art pad in a real magic marker so that I
can make a real bowling ball up here
which brings me to the last part the
magic moment the magic moment ladies and
gentlemen that moment where your brain
struggles with a false reality that was
creating your mind and the truth has
revealed I will end with a quote from a
magician who lived about two generations
before I got into magic Geri Andrews and
he was known to say I can fool you
because you&#39;re a human you have a
wonderful human mind that&#39;s no different
from my human mind usually when the mind
is fooled it didn&#39;t make a mistake it
came to the wrong conclusion for the
right reasons
