over the past eight years I visited 300
ghost towns across British Columbia and
the entire west coast you might be
asking why I do to you sometimes in that
time the 300 different towns that I
visited have brought me a lot of stories
and enlightenment treasures that I share
not physical treasures I don&#39;t steal
from the ghost town there&#39;s not a lot of
amenities and when I was talking to my
sister about why we go to these ghost
towns and what we do I asked her why she
thought that I did and she cackled dand
said because you&#39;re in too deep and she
was right because when you get too deep
into something it becomes an interest
and then a passion and then a lifestyle
and it&#39;s a lifestyle worth living for me
going to ghost towns has offered me the
ability to see different patterns
between those 300 places and I&#39;d also
like to tell you that the biggest
pattern have noticed is the historical
erasure is real and it&#39;s prevalent I&#39;ve
seen it and I&#39;ve touched it
and whenever I see and touch historical
erasure in those towns it&#39;s hard not to
unsee it in my own City
but those patterns are a bit more fun
than that so I&#39;ll tell you a bit about
that first a few years ago I was driving
through rural Idaho and I looked to my
right and I thought damn that font looks
familiar
on that town sign and so I veered off
the highway my friends didn&#39;t like that
part and then spending a few hours in
the town that we drove into they also
didn&#39;t love that part because you know
rural Idaho
but I likes that part and I liked that
part for a few different reasons but
specifically because that fought brought
me into a town that I had seen before I
had seen it in British Columbia in the
middle of the Kootenays I&#39;d seen the
same buildings and I had seen them
washed away and I had seen them falling
over and I had seen them and it seen the
same landmarks but in this town there
were people living I don&#39;t know if
you&#39;ve ever seen someone come from the
pec from the dead which probably haven&#39;t
right
but I saw a living town that I had
already seen dead somewhere else and I
see that a lot these are the ghost towns
I visited in British Columbia and I
should probably tell you what it ghost
town is I&#39;m not a paranormal researcher
despite talking about everything I just
did but I am an anthropologist I study
culture ghost towns are places that are
either abandoned or very close to
abandoned I&#39;m gonna let you in on a
secret that I like the places that are
close to abandoned a little bit more
only because the people are super
interesting ghost towns in British
Columbia can be a lot of different
things they can be mills or company
towns some of them are entire cities or
villages their indigenous settlements
they&#39;re everything but for me also one
of my favorite types is going into a
town where there&#39;s absolutely nothing
left and just seeing an open field and
walking a little bit up a hill and you
can see the perfect outline of the
houses you get a little bit closer and
you start looking between the rows and
you can see their gardens poison ivy
sometimes English ivy also sometimes you
start looking for different types of
gardens you can find Chinese vegetable
gardens you can find Japanese vegetable
gardens if you go close enough to the
ocean you can find different oyster
shells for people who have sat there on
the beach shucking them
I visited one of those company towns
earlier this summer company towns again
are places where an industry moves in
and then builds up and the people who
move there their lives in a lot of ways
are controlled by that company their
money their income their fun their
families everything is brought in to
that isolated place I visited the town
of Ocean Falls Ocean Falls was built up
in 1906 and it&#39;s an unseeded health sect
territory it&#39;s in the Mid Coast and it&#39;s
huge at one point it had about 3500
people living there now has about 8
somewhere they told me that it gets
bigger in population but someone went to
me and said 15 when you go to places
like this you start having to ask the
same questions over and over again
especially after doing it 300 times the
first question that I like to ask is
what&#39;s left when I look around what was
here and what&#39;s left so in Ocean Falls
there&#39;s apartment buildings
there&#39;s an entire hotel there&#39;s also a
new fish hatchery an entire town called
Marten Valley it&#39;s like a suburb suburbs
like in ocean folks
all company temps of suburbs because you
weren&#39;t allowed to keep living in them
if after you retired from the company so
people still live there we started out
our time in the town by visiting
everyone on Canada Day because we
thought that it would be a good way to
meet everyone because they&#39;d all be in
one place and they were there at the
ferry terminal there are lighting
fireworks and drinking and everyone was
kind of scattered around this one kind
of odd bench I later on found out that
the bench was from the bowling alley
they just hold it outside it looks like
a bowling bench if you really think
about it the other thing I started
thinking about though in these towns was
with the people who were there how do
you keep in contact with them how did
they keep in contact with each other and
I asked and they said Oh our postal code
I was like what&#39;s that and they&#39;re like
very odd town one pub only vo t 1p oh
and there is one pub that&#39;s how people
keep in contact on Monday Wednesday and

Friday it&#39;s open from 4:00 till 7:00 the
people that I met in Ocean Falls are
some of the best people I&#39;ve ever met
when I start thinking about places like
Ocean Falls it goes from thinking about
what&#39;s there and who&#39;s there and why
they&#39;re sometimes but then it drifts
into another part I&#39;m just a lot harder
to understand and that&#39;s who&#39;s missing I
can tell you what buildings are missing
because I have them on maps but who&#39;s
missing is much harder and in the
research leading up to Ocean Falls you
know I started realizing how many people
were included in the research but only
in sort of off sites you could see that
there was a huge Japanese town at one
point I knew there was a Chinatown at
one point I knew that there was a
red-light district at one point but
until actually going there there&#39;s no
way to find those things the places I go
are ungoogleable that&#39;s the erasure bit
the ungoogleable bed because erasure is
a human thing we push out difference
if you think about every war ever fought
they didn&#39;t just kill people they took
down entire towns they were actually
archives they wrecked the museums they
wrecked all the culture and when we
destroy our culture there&#39;s nothing to
go back to erasure in ghost towns is
places like Ocean Falls that when you
walk up the hill on the narrow wooden
stilts
they don&#39;t go anywhere because the
Japanese town was destroyed during the
Second World War because everyone was
scared and they pushed out difference
keep in mind Japanese internment in
British Columbia went from 1941 till
1949 that&#39;s five years after the war
ended and they stayed in the Kootenays
in other ghost towns oddly that I go to
is where the internment camps were so in
knowing this about ghost towns and in
knowing this about in Falls again it&#39;s
really hard not to see those same
patterns in our own cities when I look
at Ocean Falls I see a completely gone
Japan town and I see the stilts where
Chinatown used to be but I also see
Hogan&#39;s Alley in Vancouver which was
underneath the Georgia Street Viaduct it
was taken out and people were displaced
to build a road and I see the
gentrification in Chinatown and let me
tell you the gentrification of a part of
a city is much scarier when you&#39;ve seen
it already in a hundred different places
I will let you know too that there&#39;s not
a lot to do in Ocean Falls so we did
drink a little one night which part took
with one of the locals a lot of the
locals it&#39;s like when you drink with
four people you&#39;re drinking with half
the town
so by the end of the night we&#39;re
drinking with one-eighth of the town one
person and he convinced us to go into
the abandoned hotel the Martin hotel and
we had gone into the other buildings
that were some reason this hotel was
much scarier and it&#39;s because the floor
was sunken in that&#39;s the scary part so

we went in it was 1:30 in the morning
and he started telling us all of his
stories there and we went through the
secret entrance which is in the bakery
and we walked through the bowling alley
we walked through the three different
bars in the hotel we walked all the way
up to the maybe eighth floor and just
looked out at the ocean together but the
thing that took me the most was this one
sign which I&#39;ll read are chibi Martin an
able executive who&#39;s sturdy character
and sympathetic understanding of people
created the community spirit at Ocean
Falls which is a monument to his memory
that&#39;s a weird sign do you guys have
that over your fireplace at home if you
look closely at the top of this picture
you can see that presumably the photo of
our chibi Martin has been taken down one
of the locals runs a museum where he
takes everything from the town and puts
it in one place I&#39;m assuming it was him
I also found other people who care very
deeply about the history of ocean Falls
one door in Martin Valley says over 250
pounds of ocean Falls history and you
think for a second
does that mean that someone who loves
history and is 250 pounds will charge a
me right now they won&#39;t she has
scrapbooks and they&#39;re full of ocean
Falls history and we spend an entire
afternoon together flipping through all
the pages and that was the ungoogleable
part everything she had there doesn&#39;t
exist anywhere else just in her heart
and in her mind in her scrapbooks but
she didn&#39;t just collect white history
notion follows because she grew up with
everybody she knew about the Japan
she knew about the Chinatown she knew
about the red-light district she knew
about everything and sitting with her I
got to sit with ocean Falls and by not
going to these places I don&#39;t get to
learn the patterns from her I don&#39;t get
to learn about the erasure either I&#39;m in
too deep
on that same trip we walked through
another town Bella Bella which is health
sick nations town it&#39;s not health sick
territory it&#39;s unseeded we found this
sign in the local grocery store
keeping in mind this is right around
Canada Day Canada 150 years health sick
14 thousand years well you can&#39;t see
very easily is the most important part
of this sign it&#39;s a little plus sign
that&#39;s drawn right after the zeros it&#39;s
hand drawn because the hell took no a
lot more than 14 thousand years so that
14 thousand is reflecting something else
that&#39;s happening in that area an
archaeological dig that&#39;s unearthed
he&#39;ll take everything let me read this
with you discovery of 14 thousand year
old settlement in Canada could rewrite
North American history how do you
rewrite and already rewritten history
IFL science when you start going a
little bit further into the province you
find similar stories again again and
again same patterns same erasure this is
quenelle forks was a gold rush town
established about 1858 in the middle of
one of the houses in the town it&#39;s
called a tonk house and in this town the
entire town is a Chinatown I didn&#39;t read
that anywhere before going nowhere did
it mention in going to quenelle forks
I learned the story of shorty Lahaie who
was the last town member he left the
town to about 1955 when the second to
last member he found him on the way to
work
on the trail 17 kilometers real to bully
Pitts mine and that&#39;s where short Eli
found his friend shorty llaha is history
isn&#39;t written anywhere but a single
hand-painted sign in downtown quenelle
forks downtown is an overstatement tonk
houses aren&#39;t just your average house
they&#39;re associated with Chinese
Benevolent Association societies those
places in Chinatown that are starting
just try and stop the gentrification
that&#39;s happening there they hold all the
records they hold all the Chinese
records for this area and every other
ghost town every other Chinatown that
exists in British Columbia it&#39;s all the
social records and everyone there as
white people we have access to that
through the community archives don&#39;t
forget that when I go back to my own
city here in Vancouver I can&#39;t help but
thinking of ghost towns as you can maybe
tell but specifically my city is New
Westminster which is nearby I can tell
you about every single house on this
hill I can tell you the years that they
were built who built them why kind of
and when I look at them I know them
because I&#39;ve read their water records
I&#39;ve read everything about them who I
can&#39;t tell you about is in the deeper
picture my City newest Minster is built
on the unceded territory of the kite
nation I don&#39;t know who that man is and
I never will so how do we combat
historical erasure in the fact that we
don&#39;t actually get to know the stories
of places that we&#39;ve never been to
especially when they&#39;re not online and
building a map it&#39;s gonna be great
yeah my map is called populace map my
idea is that if you have a historic
timeline how do we counter out the
history that we already know so if you
know about white pioneers and settlers
during the gold rush why not choose a
filter that suggests otherwise to know
more about the eight hundred black
pioneers or the Chinese pioneers or the
Sikh mills or Sikh pioneers who came up
here know about more people to know
about the indigenous displacement to
know about all those internment camps to
know about places like Ocean Falls we
have to think of more than one timeline
and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to offer
populist map is a collaboration between
me and a local design group called rx VP
and I&#39;ve loved being able to turn my
ideas into something beautiful and
usable and it&#39;s not ready yet but when
it is I&#39;ll be ready - it took me a
hundred ghost towns to look past that
hill it took me 200 ghost towns to work
my way into the sandbar and want to know
more it took me three hundred ghost
towns to realize that I&#39;ll never know it
all so I ask you today who&#39;s missing
thank you
[Applause]
you
