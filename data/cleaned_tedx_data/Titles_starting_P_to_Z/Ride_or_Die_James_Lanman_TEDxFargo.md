everyone my name is James Landman I&#39;m a
singer-songwriter and a full-time
touring musician this wasn&#39;t always the
case as recently as last October I was
actually freelancing doing graphic
design and UX design and the more I took
on that kind of worked the less I
started picking up my guitar and
everything kind of reached a fever pitch
when last October I got offered two
full-time jobs from tech companies in
San Francisco to move to the west coast
and suddenly that Plan B that everyone
always told me to have as a musician was
right in front of me you know that that
safe full job with money I&#39;d never seen
before benefits I&#39;d never seen before
and I sat there and I had to think about
it right then and there whether I would
take that Plan B or whether I&#39;d go for
music and I chose music and once I did
that it was thank you yeah I appreciate
it don&#39;t clap don&#39;t clap yet&#39; wait till
you hear what I do okay so I you know I
I thought how am I gonna do how am I
gonna do music full-time right so I&#39;m
not famous nobody knows who I am I&#39;m
just a guy with a dream on a TEDx stage
and I decided to move into a van and
start touring around the country as Greg
said doing a hundred shows in 2017 this
is the 73rd performance of the year so
I&#39;m making my way around just going on
the ground trying to find the people who
are into what I do so when I was asked
to do this performance an organizer who
is yet to be named said I really like
your repertoire but it&#39;s all romantic
heartbreak songs you have anything
that&#39;s more in line with the theme of
the evening and I stupidly said you know
I do have this one song called ride or
die but it&#39;s unfinished and he goes that
sounds great
that was four days ago so so I&#39;m sitting
here and I&#39;m freaking out a little bit
because I&#39;m playing for you know a
billion people and and I&#39;m like god I&#39;m
gonna play a song I never played before
but then I thought you know what that&#39;s
kind of the theme of this year and I
thought about the theme of the event and
I guess I&#39;m for risk so this is Ryder
die I&#39;ve never played before
be gentle thank you
[Music]
I was one before now that something
isn&#39;t it
at least that&#39;s finally something I can
in me
I played the same old games
I just couldn&#39;t win and spawn that Fred
I knew that I forever be I&#39;m taking I&#39;m
gonna go heart gonna chase it down to
the Sun
it&#39;s all I ever wanted and deep down
somehow I know it&#39;s gonna work out all
right
and this is it baby this is it I lay it
on the line
I&#39;m tired of talking about it it&#39;s not
enough anymore so here I go now ride or
die

I was so young back then trying so hard
to pretend that I traveled the distance
that I was someone but the truth of it
is people only give a shit about where
you&#39;re coming back where you&#39;re coming
from
I&#39;m gonna go out gonna chase it down to
the Sun
right it&#39;s everything I wanted and
somehow I know it&#39;s all gonna
work out all right
and this is it baby but this is it all
ate up I&#39;m tired of talking about it

I see ride or die
