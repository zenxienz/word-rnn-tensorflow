picture this

it&#39;s 6:40 4:00 a.m. and you&#39;re just
starting to rouse and then as the clock
ticks over to the designated hour the
music playing on the radio is you&#39;re in
this chair like you&#39;re washing your hair
and you&#39;re singing along and you&#39;re
thinking to yourself oh my goodness
music is magic I&#39;m gonna set my alarm
clock to that song every single day but
let&#39;s just run that fan again and this
time with a couple of small changes it&#39;s

still 6:44 a.m. joy you&#39;re starting to
rouse but as the clock ticks over this
time the music playing on the radio is
in our sunshine when he&#39;s coming and
he&#39;s always but anytime you know all of
a sudden you remember the relationship
breakup that just happened and you
become plagued with questions like will
I ever find love again will anybody ever
love me again am i destined to be alone
and instead of being out and in the
shower you reach over and you turn off
the alarm clock and you send a quick
text to work saying that you&#39;re feeling
very sick and you pull the cover back
over your head as the song goes around
and around Wow that&#39;s two very different
morning experiences isn&#39;t it from two
classic sunshine hits what does that
tell us about the power of music and how
it works while most people assume it
explains how music has an effect on us
and makes us feel and do certain things
but actually in my work as a music
therapist and a researcher I have seen
the same music have very different
effects on people so if you&#39;re not going
through a relationship break up and in
our Sun shower where he is gone comes on
you might just go oh I remember that guy
that was beautiful or you might get
caught up in the poignant melody and how
stunning it is and no matter how good
that drum beat from Katrina and the
waves is it&#39;s not going to get you out
of bed if you&#39;ve just had like a major
car accident or something like that
music is definitely not magic so what is
it that&#39;s counterintuitive to our
assumptions about how music works it&#39;s
not that music has the power to do
something to you it&#39;s you who has the
power to use the almighty affordances of
music
any way that you choose and because you
have the power and responsibility you
can do that to make yourself feel
fabulous you can use it to relax you can
use it to pump yourself up you can use
it to connect with people but you can
also use it to make yourself feel worse
and music has been used for some pretty
dark purposes over time like isolation
an exclusion Hitler is an excellent
example of somebody who clearly
understood how to use the power of music
he combined pomp and ceremony and
marching together in time to promote
group bonding which is very effective
for both between him and his troops and
he paired that with widespread community
group singing of Nazi propaganda songs
putting this enormous sense of community
and of people who were in the in-group
which as we know he then manipulated and
turned against those outside of the
group and those in the group were able
to tolerate unthinkable cruelty and
violence it happens all the time today
online in schools if you think about
what it feels like when you go to a
concept and that invincible feeling like
everybody is just bopping along to the
music and singing and you feel connected
and you transcend the moment and you&#39;re
so combined with everybody around you
and how that actually could be turned
and manipulated in any moment so that
those outside the group are excluded the
power of music can be used in any
direction so exclusion is one and
intensifying emotions is another if we
go back to that scene from the beginning
the relationship breakup scene and fast
forward a couple of days you make it to
work you tolerate the day and you&#39;re
driving home glad to have made it
through and then all of a sudden
somebody breaks suddenly in front of you
and somebody else cuts across in front
of you and you start to get frustrated
so you go into the supermarket
and the person at the checkout counter
is unbelievably rude to you for no
reason at all so that by the time you
get home you&#39;re feeling extremely
intense and you choose not to put on air
no such because you&#39;re not feeling sad
you&#39;re feeling mad so the question is
what rage anthem will you go for
Tchaikovsky very good Lincoln Park could
work
how about Nirvana Morissette
[Music]
every spring is trying to sublimate your
rage through the music and out the other
side so that you feel better
but unfortunately you don&#39;t feel better
you just feel more rage and even more
unfortunately so do the neighbors who
have heard it all before and who raced
down to your door the minute the volume
goes throw the rope and start knocking
but you don&#39;t need them because you
scream
fun fact the police received more calls
to intervene in violent situations
between neighbors when music has been
the trigger then you would expect so the
most common use I&#39;ve seen of using music
is for rumination we all do it it&#39;s very
normal to use music to match our moods
and music has this incredible power to
bear witness to the intensity of our
darkest feelings and we can listen to it
over and over and we can listen to it
over
[Music]
and
you know it can be the classic breakup
song or it could be your nobody
understands me song or your rage song
it&#39;s perfectly normal to use music in
that way as the Sun Goes Down and the
hours go by and we truly believe in hope
and often it occurs that we get some
sense of release through that
opportunity to stay with our feelings in
the moment but because we&#39;re the ones
who choose how to use music it
definitely does not always work that way
you can use music to make yourself feel
better but you can use music to stay
intensely connected to dark feelings so
when I say that I&#39;m a music therapist
what that means is that I use active
music making and music listening with
people who are currently living with the
dark side perhaps it&#39;s due to illness or
injury or a range of life circumstances
and my particular work the people I like
most to work with their young and
lessons and they often are struggling
with depression and other issues and
they really don&#39;t need any help
connecting to their darkest feelings
they feel them inside they feel them
above them they&#39;re surrounded by their
darkest feelings it&#39;s tough but they do
believe in the power of music and they
often rely on music to help them to feel
better they&#39;re some of the greatest
users but because they misunderstand the
mechanism of how music works and that it
relies on their own agency to use it in
particular ways the results of their
music listening can sometimes be
extremely bewildering to them and as I
often hear from people to the caring
adults who are watching over them so I
once worked with a young man who had
been using drumming very successfully
for a number of years to ventilate his
feelings his rage and he was doing it in
a way it doesn&#39;t hurt anybody when you
play the drums you have to be pretty bit
but it doesn&#39;t hurt anybody it was very
successful strategy him for him but as
the years went by and as his psychosis
worsened he began to associate practice
we&#39;re building up towards cutting in
self-harm and so something which had
been really helpful for him changed and
became extremely unhelpful same action
same intention he really just wanted to
feel better but a very different outcome
so we worked together in music therapy
to establish a connection with a
healthier musical identity looking at
different ways of using music in his
life and establishing a sense of agency
about doing that and we gradually
reintroduce strumming and over time he
was able to keep drumming again without
triggering the desire to self-harm but
it took time and it took commitment this
therapy usually does there was another
young woman that I worked with and she
classically liked to listen to music as
a way of escaping from the very
dysfunctional life circumstances that
she found herself in and so instead she
would focus on lyrics about love and
hope and other things that we all like
to think about but as she escaped she
also disconnected from some pretty
important life functions like eating and
then she began to compare her own body
unfavorably to the pop idols who she
worships even though she&#39;d managed an
astonishing and very unhealthy loss of
weight during that period of time so
then we worked together using song
writing in that case to write a new
narrative for her life that began by
acknowledging the complexity and the
darkness that she was living with at
that time but stepped gradually towards
something more hopeful again as a part
of long-term treatment so neither of
these two young people were at the
effect of music making them feel worse
but both of them used music as a way of
supporting their journey into the
darkness
and in both cases they used it very
successfully despite not intentionally
meaning to do it that way so the next
time you&#39;re listening to music it&#39;s
still a great thing to do it&#39;s a wonder
way to match the mood for all I ask is
that you notice whether or not your
intentions are being actualized through
your music use because it doesn&#39;t happen
by magic so if you want to use music to
feel better
great did it work if it didn&#39;t work
straight away and you&#39;re happy to wait a
little bit and spend more time there did
it work eventually and if you want to
use music to make you feel worse which
we often do then notice when you&#39;ve had
enough time there how you might use
music to step away again when I&#39;m
working with young people we often kind
of actualize that process by creating
playlists together so we start with
songs that mirror and validate the
intensity of the darkest feelings and
then we choose more songs from their
favorite preferred repertoire and we
step them gradually away towards
something that&#39;s more hopeful so that
they have a pathway out of their dark
feelings in case they get stuck there I
remember overly worked with one young
man who decided he would reprogram his
favorite music use once he realized that
he was using it in an unhealthy way and
then actually his favorite songs had
become associated with trauma in his
life and when he listened to the songs
he felt retraumatization is expand have
positive thoughts and then if he had a
good time if it all worked out well and
he had a good time when he drive home
again he would play those songs again
and he effectively reprogrammed his own
music use because he really wanted to
keep listening to those songs so I
encourage you when you&#39;re using music to
keep it up
it&#39;s a great access accessible resource
in our world more freely available to us
now than it has ever been so it&#39;s a
wonderful opportunity in a great time
but just to be conscious of the fact
that you were the one who is responsible
for how you use music and that if you
choose to use music to take yourself
into the dark side just remember to use
it
bring you back again hmm thank you
[Applause]
