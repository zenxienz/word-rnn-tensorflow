hello I am a cognitive scientist and I
like to do research I love it but there
is one thing I have to admit when you do
research in cognitive science you never
know what you will get every study is a
leap into the unknown into the future
that is uncertain as well they are on
put it quite nicely in one of his talks
you enter a cloud where you don&#39;t know
where you will end it is this experience
of uncertainty that unsettles young
researchers and it&#39;s still unsettled
myself sometimes and I think it is also
this uncertainty that unsettled us when
we think of the future this can be
frightening and paralyzing at times so
this is why we struggle when we want to
embrace the future but there&#39;s one thing
that helps me and this is
improvisational theater short improv so
what I want to show you today is how I
think that improv can help everyone to
embrace the future so what is improv
actually improv is theater without any
script the audience provides an idea and
the players get on stage immediately
afterwards and start to develop the
story and the characters live onstage
for the audience
this provides an enjoyable and inspiring
evening but for the players improv can
be much more it is a mind-blowing
experience it teaches us to boldly go
into the unknown as no one on stage
knows what happens next
I&#39;ve played improv for 20 years and for
10 years here in Racine with my group
vehicle tour improv has changed me and
in my trainings I have seen how it
changed many different people students
prisoners cancer patients work teams
and even teachers so how does improv do
this at this point I think it&#39;s a good
idea that you try improve yourself so
please I want to invite you to play a
little game of word by word which is a
seemingly simple improv game so before
you start now please don&#39;t make any
arrangements beforehand okay
the only arrangement you can make now
please is to find a partner to play with
so please ask one of your neighbors if
he wants to play with you Yoshi who
can&#39;t resist there right okay since most
of you have a neighbor I hope you are
now ready to play so what you will do in
the following you will tell the
beginning of a fairy tale please don&#39;t
speak about which fairy tale you want to
tell okay so you will do that and you
will do that vert by vert so you will
say a word then your neighbor will say a
word and you will say a word again you
build the sentences together to make
things easier for you you might start
with once upon a time you know that
right or in german is VAR n mal okay but
simply experience the uncertainty and
remember that you simply speak word by
word are you ready
kind of okay so go ahead and start with
your fairy tale
okay thank you
thank you very much
yes yep you get on the pole great
[Applause]
so thank you very much for engaging into
this so who have you had fun simply say
yes that&#39;s great that&#39;s what it is about
mostly yes okay so what you experienced
when you did this is what most players
of impress experienced when they do this
the first and they have a lot of fun but
there are other things they learn by the
way so what is it that we learn that
helps us to embrace the future I think
that improv helps us to face three
paradoxes that are typical when we face
uncertainty in these three paradoxes are
those ones the first one is the so
called preserving paradox well I call it
this way so the preserving paradox means
that on the one hand you want to
preserve what&#39;s good what&#39;s proven but
on the other hand we all want to change
things we want to improve things so an
improv when you start to play improv you
don&#39;t want to change anything most
players are frightened of driving the
story forward and they are frightened to
give strong impulses they say things
like I don&#39;t want to destroy what we
already have I don&#39;t want to make
mistakes I don&#39;t want to break the rules
so when we play improv for a longer time
we learn that yes roots are important
and we have to keep things together but
we also learn that if something strange
happens it doesn&#39;t destroy the play as
long as we accept it as long as we make
it big and exploit its full potential
even more the cool things can only
happen if you make mistakes and break
the rules sometimes so when you tell the
fairy tale of Red Riding Hood and have
accidentally the girl swallowing the
wolf that&#39;s the point where your story
might get interesting so this is what
Keith Johnstone termed the oh yes
attitude and it is this attitude that
helps us to accept whatever comes and
use it and make something great out of
it in the future
the second paradox is what I call the
planning paradox so on the one hand we
want to plan to take matters in our
hands but on the other hand we actually
can&#39;t plan we don&#39;t know what will come
it doesn&#39;t make sense we can only react
so in the beginning of playing improv
you can see the players being totally
absorbed by the plans they are sitting
along the side the stage and they think
stuff like I go on the stage I will be
the alien and I will shoot this
astronaut with my laser pistol and so on
and so on
well sadly the story develops in this
time and it might take a turn and when
the alien gets on stage it doesn&#39;t find
itself on planets walk anymore facing
the astronaut but it finds itself in the
kitchen of mr. Miller so if the player
sticks to his plan now he&#39;s lost so when
we play him for for a longer time we
learn that we have to accept our plans
there are good things expectations or
something we all have we all build them
up automatically and they can also guide
our action quite well but we also learn
to stay in the present observe what&#39;s
happening and the moment the plans don&#39;t
fit the reality anymore we let them go
easily as William Faulkner put it quite
nicely you have to kill your darlings if
they don&#39;t support your story anymore it
is this ability to plan and to let plans
go easily that makes us spontaneous when
we face the future and want to act in it
the third paradox is the initiative
paradox so on the one hand we want to
shape the future according to our ideas
and ideals but on the other hand we need
to consider the needs and the ideas of
other ones and give them space to thrive
to you if you want to be successful so
in the beginning of playing improv you
find two types of players there&#39;s the
one type that loves to go on stage fire
one idea after the other one and basking
in
they feel quite great on stage then
there are the other ones they are quite
careful they react to what happens on
stage let others go first they seem
quite on spectacular and often they feel
miserable on stage when we play improv
for longer we learn that they have to
embrace both sides as players so yes we
need to drive the story forward we need
to give strong impulses we need to make
things big but even more need to observe
the others to accept their impulses to
give space and time for emotions to grow
and to make each other good time on
stage so it&#39;s the balance between action
and observation that lets us tell a good
story together the best question you can
ask when you leave the stage is how did
you my dear co actor enjoy playing with
me and it is this attitude that helps us
to act together and create cool things
when we face the future so with us in
mind we can now develop an image how
improv helps us to embrace the future we
have two players on stage and they have
nothing in their hands and then one
player starts with a little idea he
simply says good morning my dear servant
so this is this idea and the other
player he accepts this idea and might
say something like oh yes good morning
my lord
and then he develops his own idea and
says well did you prepare well for the
duel and he gives this idea to the other
play and the other one accepts and says
oh yes I&#39;m well prepared we will show
Lord monthly how to win and then he
enters his own idea and says something
like well my servant did you prepare the
bow and the other player accepts this
idea and says oh yes the bow is well
prepared and then he had this idea and
says I think you will blame the violin
much better than Lord MA
play and the other player accepts this
and so on and so on so it&#39;s the oh yes
attitude it&#39;s the spontaneous II and the
ability to permanently switch between
action and observation that allows our
players to end an amplification feedback
loop here and in this loop the story
develops a nun self-organized manner
with no control by any single player at
a certain point the story seems to take
over and to drive the action of the
players even further this story on the
stage is in real life the story of our
future so as citizens who want to
embrace the future we are improvisers on
the stage of life yes we could get
caught by the paradoxes of uncertainty
but improv shows us a way how we can go
further into the unknown by saying oh
yes by enjoying to plan but even
enjoying it more to let plans go and by
acting together because we can only
create cool things if we act together
it is this optimism and spontaneous T
that offers that impro offers to me
as a scientist doing my research and as
a citizen who wants to embrace the
future in a thing
this experience is offered by improv to
everyone thank you very much
[Applause]
