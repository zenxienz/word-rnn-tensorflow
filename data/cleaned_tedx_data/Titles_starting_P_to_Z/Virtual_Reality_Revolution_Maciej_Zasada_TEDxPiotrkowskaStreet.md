virtual-reality it became popular in
2012 mainly thanks to oculus rift I
guess some of you may actually remember
their Kickstarter campaign it was a
massive success and also what&#39;s really
interesting is they managed to
successfully fulfill all you know they
delivered the actual working devices to
all the backers who gave enough money
and this is actually when the first that
was the first time when most people
managed to experience virtual reality
and due to the success and the
incredible popularity of VR there were
lots of you know cheap alternatives
introduced and one of the first ones was
Google and as the name says it was
actually a piece of cardboard that she
just pulled according to a manual and
then you put your phone inside and
you&#39;ve got your headset so that was
really amazing and also people found
ways to create quite cheap content so we
had those portable mobile 360 cameras so
you could just shoot a 360 video and
that would be experienced in VR and also
there were lots of small simple
experiences like a really popular but
all there coaster ride that was really
fun but true really engaging virtual
reality an immersive one it requires
much more than this it&#39;s hardware which
is expensive and also producing content
this kind of content is you know much
more costly than it is to shoot a simple
360 video so due to the fact not many
people actually managed to experience
true virtual reality we know the simple
ones we know just a bit of it but we
don&#39;t see the full potential and also
because of the fact there&#39;s lots of
misconceptions about virtual reality
first one is we think
this is something new right and uh no
sorry in 1838 there was a demonstration
of a device which essentially just um
was you know displaying two different
images one for your left eye one for
your right eye and what was interesting
is that essentially you know the brain
was able to reconstruct a
three-dimensional representation of the
image from just two separate flat images
and that was you know the birth of
stereoscopy and a bit later in 1961 we
had a fully working prototype of what we
would call today a virtual reality
headset so that was a device with like
proper displace it could display two
different images again one for your left
eye one for your right eye and also what
is nowadays required for a virtual
reality it also attracted the motion of
your head so it was no longer just you
know staring straight forward it was
also being able to look around that was
pretty cool and a few years later there
was actually a full virtual reality kit
available which didn&#39;t only consist of a
virtual reality headset but also of
gloves like VR gloves so you could use
them to interact with the environment so
it was no longer a passive experience
instead you could actually become part
of it and you could interact with it
another thing when we think about
virtual reality at all a lot of us say
well people will get addicted to this
like I&#39;m absolutely sure and well this
is maybe not necessarily a misconception
because that may need to be the case but
just think about like what you can get
addicted to like sugar for example is
one of the most addictive substances
worldwide there&#39;s so many people
addicted to sugar like you don&#39;t even
believe and everything essentially just
lies in education if you&#39;re a kid like
this is your parents responsibility they
should tell you what&#39;s good for you and
what&#39;s not if used responsibly like TV
is not harmful to you like food is not
harmful to you we all need to eat it&#39;s
just that the X
dreams are not good for you and if
you&#39;re an adult you probably already
have this you know intuition which use
every day so you know what&#39;s good for
you and you shouldn&#39;t be worried about
virtual reality but what&#39;s really most
interesting to me and hopefully to you
as well is like what really is virtual
reality and when most people hear the
word VR they instantaneously just see
the goggles and well that&#39;s true like at
least for now
you do need the goggles to experience
virtual reality but it&#39;s not just about
the device what we should see when we
hear the word virtual reality is
actually all the potential all the
applications that it brings it&#39;s not
just how we experience it but what we
can do with it
and actually let me just bring you back
a couple years ago maybe a few more than
a couple years ago so the same thing was
like there was radio one day and
suddenly television was invented so what
did we do with it what was the first
type of content that appeared on TV well
so what we saw back then was mostly
musicals it was news so this is the kind
of content which works perfectly well on
a radio you pretty much don&#39;t need
anything else and it&#39;s all those just
like you know people saw okay we can put
you know vision there is so yeah let&#39;s
put a camera in a radio station and
that&#39;s it so we you know this is the
natural consequence like we&#39;re trying to
adapt thanks to the new medium instead
of three invent things and think outside
of the box and who would think back then
like how can you experience TV what are
the true possibilities like would anyone
think back then that you can have
television on-demand like we have
nowadays or for example how you watch TV
like does it have to be just sitting on
a sofa no it&#39;s gonna be for example
watching it on a fridge well I&#39;m not
sure how practical practical it is but
it is possible and like no one would
think about this bike back then and
about the content again most of us
thought yes we need the camera we need
to shoot the content
well actually you can also have content
produced by computers you can have
animations and that&#39;s equally fine for a
TV but it really took many years until
people saw all the true potential of
television and this is exactly where we
are now with virtual reality we need to
see its full potential and what we do
instead quite often unfortunately is we
try to adopt so film for virtual reality
it&#39;s still being shot with cameras which
are just slightly modified on top of the
cameras that are used for a normal
cinema and they are displayed you know
if you&#39;re lucky they will be
stereoscopic so you can see you know
proper 3d but it can&#39;t really feel part
of the movie it&#39;s not like you&#39;re in it
you can&#39;t really walk around it it&#39;s
like it really feels like someone just
stuck a really good you know 360 TV
around your head so it&#39;s still not
amazing and then what do we do with
games sometimes we experience them again
just it&#39;s slightly improved way on top
of what we could do with a regular
gaming console so we have the goggles
but we still use the controllers which
you know from you know all the gaming
consoles out there so it&#39;s adapting the
content instead of inventing new ones
you know best poke for virtual reality
so the re it&#39;s not about the goggles
forget the goggles like they are needed
but you need to see much more beyond
that and what I want you to take from
this talk is essentially just open your
eyes for all the possibilities that are
out there and they are really just
within a reach it&#39;s a matter of maximum
a few years when the equipment becomes
like truly available to everyone so it&#39;s
going to be truly awesome and let me
show you why but first of all you may
ask what is this virtual reality really
like you know we so it&#39;s not the goggle
as to what it is and well you know so
there&#39;s no one true fixed definition of
virtual reality but what I like to say
that VR is is it&#39;s all the mean
of almost teleporting the person to a
different reality different than the one
they are actually part of but what is
this other reality is actually
completely up to us and up to the
content creator and this is the beauty
of virtual reality so it can be an
actual place which you know resembles a
physical place somewhere out there just
you know in a different spot on the
globe and and that&#39;s extremely useful
for so-called VR tourism but no one
fixes you to what&#39;s real virtual reality
can be completely abstract and this is a
pretty cool example of a marketing
campaign which was advertising one of
the chewing gums and essentially instead
of showing you a chewing gum in VR like
well maybe that would be interesting
because like you&#39;ve got the goggles on
but actually it&#39;s just a chewing gum
right it&#39;s not that exciting but what
they did instead is they completely
broke the rules of physics and they
downscaled you as a user to like
microscopic size and they have put you
like inside of the experience of chewing
a chewing gum so you as a user would fly
from a completely abstract world of
tastes of smells you could see the
smells with your eyes and this is
incredible about VR it&#39;s like there are
no limits it&#39;s all up to you
and then VR is not only about
experiencing it&#39;s also about creating so
for example if you wanted to try
sculpting in a real world you would have
to buy all the tools like get the
material like you know it is you know
quite cumbersome but with VR actually
what you can do is like you can do this
all virtually you can have a
three-dimensional sculpture around you
you can walk around it and you don&#39;t
even need the tools you can have as many
tools as you want and you just switch
them virtually and this is incredible
about VR again there are no limits and
there&#39;s also like some of you may say
all right so we&#39;ve got all the tools
we&#39;ve got the headset but like the
we&#39;ll probably isolate people right like
we&#39;ve got people worrying you know the
piece of plastic on their head and most
likely they won&#39;t be able to communicate
with anyone anyone real at least so well
oh that&#39;s also not very true there are
examples and like one of them is a
project by unit 9 where you know there&#39;s
this a real problem not sure how many
parents we actually have here in the
room but when you have a kid it becomes
really really a magical moment to the
kid
when you read them a bedtime story but
also most parents actually have to work
so they travel and they can&#39;t be with
their kids all the time so what the
project did is it allowed the parent kid
to put the VR goggles on and the kid
could actually see the the story the
tale with their own eyes they could feel
part of it but what&#39;s most important is
the mother&#39;s voice even though she was
like really far away potentially in a
different country was transmitted like
similar way to Skype for examples of
using voice over IP to the kid so the
mother would read the bedtime story from
a different place what kid can actually
see all the tale with their eyes so
that&#39;s bringing people together with
virtual reality not bringing them apart
and what also fascinates me personally
about virtual reality is its potential
in education so I guess you may remember
what it was back in like primary school
when you would learn about the universe
or at least about our solar system so
you know the teacher would come they
would give you two books and they would
tell you you know that the universe or a
destroyer system is so big it&#39;s just
like enormous and you would see what see
it on a piece of paper and you would
think like actually it&#39;s not that big
but with VR you can do much more than
this you can become part of that reality
you can travel between planets even
faster than its speed of light I get how
many of you heard that a speed of light
is like non
breakable well in VR it is you don&#39;t
have any physics like that you have to
apply so you can travel between planets
but also what could be fun for kids is
you can again break any laws and you can
for example throw planets around and you
can see how they explode together you
can actually understand and feel part of
everything that you&#39;re being taught
about so teaching and learning doesn&#39;t
have to be just mentioning facts it can
be experiencing things and also virtual
reality reality can solve many issues
with data analysis so you&#39;ve got for
example the stock market there are
people who analyze lots of data it&#39;s
usually bar charts it&#39;s you know staring
at graphs and with virtual reality I
mean well the thing which is probably
obvious to you right now is that you can
show this in 3d which is already quite
cool it&#39;s an extension but you can do
again much more than this and let me
show you something interesting so I&#39;m
not sure how many of you already knew
this but humans brain is actually
extremely plastic what it means is that
it&#39;s greatly built of a unit for a
matter and it&#39;s true they&#39;re like parts
of the brain which specialized in say
you know seeing or hearing or taste but
you can reprogram the brain you can do
almost whatever you want with it
and there are examples and it actually
works blind people can see with their
tongues the way it works is that they
have a camera mounted on their head and
the image which is well it is quite low
resolution but it is converted to
electrical current like a really subtle
one which is applied to their tongues
so essentially you can imagine like
where you would have a white pixel like
you know kind of projected onto your
tongue like the impulse is a bit
stronger and like where is black like
there&#39;s no impulse at all and actually
people are able to learn to see with
their tongues within as little as twenty
minutes and this really inspires me as a
person who actually creates things for
virtual reality
to push the boundaries further and what
about making people part of the data
what if the data is all around them if
we present them in a completely
different way which is not possible on a
paper what if we don&#39;t even explain to
people what this data means in the very
beginning but they just intuitively
learn it and their brain actually has
really high chances of learning the new
format even though no one told them how
to do it this is exactly the same thing
as seen with your tongue and because
that brought us to a bit you know more
free dimensional context let me just
bring you back for a moment to video so
I mentioned we still use the same
cameras as we do for regular I feel more
or less and it&#39;s not amazingly
interesting but actually you can also
innovate those things see like one of
you know pretty well-known companies
they created a camera which does
something completely different what it
does is it actually captures a light
field of the environment so it will
analyze the rays of light coming into
the room how they bounce of surfaces how
they travel and by knowing this they can
actually understand the exact shape of
the three-dimensional environment around
them as a video and like what&#39;s behind
objects as well and this technique has
been demonstrated at one of the
conference recently where essentially
you could see an experience they
actually did a live demo on the stage
you could become part of a film that
film was not just stereoscopic so it was
not about feeling the depth you could
actually walk slightly around things you
could see how the parallax changes you
could see what&#39;s behind the barrel for
example and this is true virtual reality
this completely you know makes you feel
like you&#39;re part of it I can tell you
it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s unbelievable and if
you can make people believe that they
are part of something else
this also can have other applications
for example there&#39;s lots of people who
are as scared of heights and I guess if
you told them to walk outside of the
window on a wooden plank and look down
they would probably just die of heart
attack before they even go out but with
virtual reality you can try to convince
them it&#39;s still scary but it is possible
they know they are in a controlled
environment they are in a room actually
the plank is there but like they come
free fall far further than like couple
centimeters so they are much more likely
to try it but you know what they feel
when they are part of this virtual world
is actually truly believable so they are
much more likely to fight their phobia
with VR than if they did it normally in
real life and there&#39;s lots of social
experiments going on with virtual
reality some of them are really
mind-bending like a small introduction
to this would be an experiment which was
called gender swap so you&#39;ve got two
people sitting backs to Bucks women and
Anna man
they were virtual reality headsets with
cameras like head mounted cameras but
their video feed is swapped so the male
sees what the girl sees the girl sees
what the menses and also just to improve
the feeling a bit they were instructed
to follow the same choreography and they
really feel like they are like inside of
the body of the different person and
actually like it&#39;s got really
far-fetched consequences I&#39;ll tell you
about one in a sec but before that let
me even tell you about an extension to
this project and this is a pretty crazy
stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s from my friend if a
child who&#39;s an innovation architect and
a creative director and he
conceptualized and did a prototype of a
project which was called Pretender and
it essentially requires two people one
is called the controller one is called
the avatar and you do the same thing
with like swapping the video well
actually the avatar is the poor guy who
doesn&#39;t see anything so it&#39;s just about
the controller is seeing what the
Persis but then there&#39;s something else
going on the avatar puts on a suit with
electrodes plugged to the muscles so
when the controller actually moves when
they raise their hands for example the
avatar can&#39;t resist his hands are being
lifted because a small electrical alec
electrical current is applied to your
muscles you know contracting them
so essentially you can force the person
to move the same way you do
and it can be really scary but
essentially what it does is you can
truly jump into the body of a different
person and not only see what they see
but also control their body so like you
know the border between actually you
know being dark person is really thin
then and again it might seem really
really scary but there is something
called in psychology as virtual empathy
and this happens when you spend a little
time impersonating someone else in a
virtual environment this was previously
known from computer games and this
actually applies even you know
significantly better and much more to
virtual reality what it means is that if
you become another person in a virtual
life for some time
you are quite likely to start
introducing their character traits in in
real life in your real life so for
example scientists have started
wondering what would it be if for
example we put an obese person in The
Pretenders suit to jump into the body of
a slim girl and potentially what would
happen is after spending lots of time in
the body of a slim pretty girl the
overweight person would start adapting
healthy behavior in a real life that&#39;s
incredible
so you can cure things which are really
difficult to solve with virtual reality
and so my goal is for you to understand
things actually first of all it&#39;s like
don&#39;t be scared about virtual reality is
awesome and it can be applied in lots of
different places from education to
business to data analysis like pretty
much every everything that you think
about but there&#39;s one more important
thing that I would like you to take from
this talk it&#39;s regardless what you do in
your life if you&#39;re a scientist if
you&#39;re a dentist if you&#39;re a mother try
to innovate don&#39;t adapt the things we
already know because times change we&#39;ve
got new technologies we&#39;ve got new
conditions and it&#39;s not about following
the same patterns we already know it&#39;s
about inventing new things which can
actually push the society forward thank
you
