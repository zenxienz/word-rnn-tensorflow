you
when I was a little girl I lived on a
magical Greek island and I loved the
night skies they were simply stunning
I would gaze up at the blanket of stars
and I was convinced but the man in the
moon he was my great friend and his sole
purpose in life was to guide me and to
protect me we lived on the side of a
hill and one night we were stumbling our
way home in the dark and I my little
legs they just couldn&#39;t quite keep up
because this hill it was like a mountain
to me so I thought I&#39;d glad something my
friend in the sky get some light some
moral support and I was genuinely
horrified to see the man in the moon he
was only half there and he just did not
look like himself at all it was like
half of his face had just fallen off and
I started to get really upset I started
to cry I started to stop my feet at this
terrible injustice to me my mom my older
sister they did try to calm me to soothe
me but this catastrophe it was just too
much to bear until I had an idea and
then just suddenly I knew everything
would be all right
daddy will fix this I said quite
confidently cuz I see my dad he was he
is brilliant at fixing everything from
watch straps to motorbikes my very own
superhero would you believe me if I said
that each one of us here has a
superpower but most of us don&#39;t use it&#39;s
a little bit like Clark Kent never
realizing he is Superman
this power our power is the subconscious
mind and you can use it for your greater
good and the good of the world or if it
is the
it can destroy your sense of self and
create a world of fear the subconscious
mind is a power that can achieve
whatever it desires when it feels loved
and safe just like a child with a loving
parent each will flourish tap into your
imagination for a moment and just think
of your conscious mind as the parent to
your subconscious mind the child a child
like any other is highly suggestible
very vulnerable and takes everything
that you say literally it depends on you
to make sense of the world and it looks
up to you for guidance and life no
pressure
with this in mind just consider for a
moment what can a parent do you want to
be to yourself one that is loving kind
and compassionate or one that is
negligent judgmental and doesn&#39;t take
the time to get to know you
when I recover it from the
disappointment that my dad he couldn&#39;t
fix the moon and it&#39;s alright dad I do
forgive you
I was once again saved by the power of
my imagination and magic girl was born
magic girl was and in fact she still is
my imaginary friends she&#39;s here with me
tonight
isn&#39;t she great magic girl is literally
amazing she always supports me she
encourages me if I doubt myself
she soothes me if I&#39;m upset I love magic
girl she is my guiding light there was a
time however that I lost much a girl it
was a little bit like the man in the
moon she didn&#39;t seem to be all there she
got lost and that I forgot totally about
her
as a result I suffered with chronic
anxiety I lived in the dark
I lost that essential scales to parent
myself with love my subconscious it felt
like a child who was afraid of the dark
and can&#39;t find the light switch I wore a
mask to the world but inside I was
cloaked with fear I canceled
appointments I turned away the people I
loved at an impending sense of doom
would twist my muscles into tight knots
so that my body constantly ached in pain
my heart it felt like it had literally
been clamped and the worst thing about
anxiety is most the time you don&#39;t even
know what it is that you&#39;re so afraid of
the fear of the fear I felt alone but I
wasn&#39;t because according to the World
Health Organization one in four people
globally will suffer with some form of
mental health issue that is one quarter
of this audience right now who could be
living in the dark thankfully I can now
say with my hand on my heart but I do
live in a world full of light and in the
words of the great Roman Emperor Marcus
Aurelius I genuinely feel that when I
rise in the morning I think of what a
precious privilege it is to be alive to
breathe to think to enjoy to love I am
living my life purpose every day
professionally I am a neuroplasticity
known as a clinical hypnotherapist and I
have helped thousands of people to
rewire their brains
become kinder to themselves and how do I
do this all with the power of our
imagination the link to be subconscious
so my hope for you this evening
is that you will take away from here the
power that you already have to love the
more vulnerable parts of yourselves to
shower yourself with kindness to believe
in the magic of life and above all to be
a loving parent to yourself and just
like the Sun the moon and the stars even
though we can&#39;t always see them your
subconscious power it&#39;s always there
it&#39;s always present seize this
opportunity to let it shine so for me
I&#39;m magic girl thank you
