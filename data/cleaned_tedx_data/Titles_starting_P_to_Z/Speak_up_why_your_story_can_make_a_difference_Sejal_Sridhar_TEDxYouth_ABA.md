three summers ago I moved to the desert
state of Oman and after weeks of
house-hunting through the capital of
Muscat my parents finally settled on a
villa sitting right in front of the
Persian Gulf as you can imagine at the
mirror age of 13 a soul thought of blue
coastline bordering Arabian desert was
all it took to make me shiver with
excitement
after all what teenager doesn&#39;t love the
prospect of another adventure opening
the doors of our new home I raced up to
the hardly staircase in peruse every
room I can find eventually and greeted
by a two-story window and it was like a
portal to another world I could see
everything from maritime air holes to
fish have been hauling their dolls onto
the golden scent my eyes begin to travel
downward as I hear further along this
window and soon I noticed the
dark-skinned men wiping it downwards the
cotton for turns then on every morning
as the clock struck eight I would see
the same man we think his bicycle
through our doors and repeating the
monotonous cycle of cleaning the same
window a few weeks later as my father
and I sit down at the dining table of
devouring crisp waffles I pull on his
sleeve and I ask him but what who is
that man to which he responds his name
is below he came here all the way from
Dhaka and he is also new just like us
just like us conventionally a phrase
with inclusivity and welcoming yet in
that moment whose unapologetically sworn
how did anyone
from the slums of Bangladesh be anything
like me and how could I be anything like
him the language barrier our upbringing
the cultural disparity
it was almost are too tangible for that
to ever happen there was no way we could
ever relate right two years later under
the torrid heat of the July Sun I
finally give in to the endless cascade
of questions I was going to speak
typical as I approached him my eyes
twinkled in anticipation and my knees
tremble in excitement I quietly take a
seat next to him as he mechanically
clean and every crevice of that window
and I ask why can&#39;t L mine now what
follows is easily the longest period of
silence I&#39;ve ever experienced and for a
second there I thought I have salted him
but then his blank stare lifts off the
floor he picks his chin up and he he
says to me that he came here because of
his feather it turns out that Dalal
emigrated to Oman and promising his
family that he would pull him out of
coffee the family of 12 lived in a home
no more than half this stage constructed
from paper palm leaves and plastic
materials that they deemed to be
luxuries so 498 hours a week 365 days a
year
he juggles three jobs as a grocery
Packer a warehouse shelf stocker and a
window I remember being an absolute off
of the extraordinary story that I
substandard together we laughed and we
cried and at the end of the day I
thought there wasn&#39;t right he was just
like us he had his own fair share of the
passions the hardships the joys and
degrees of the idiom secrecy&#39;s in the
course of everything that makes you an
eyes human and had he never told me his
story I would have never known but
hasn&#39;t always been this easy to rid
ourselves with prejudices to found in
the worlds in which there is no black
white young old rich or well the short
answer is no it truly has at the age of
nine I was bullied for the color of my
skin because in an ocean of white faces
in the Western culture it could only be
dirty and impure I would desperately try
to dodge crowded corridor his avoid
certain people but it was never rare to
hear the derogatory cow worshipper or
taxi driver I mean of course what
nine-year-old doesn&#39;t Drive although
jokes aside to myself the pigmentation
of my skin the amount of melanin in my
Duras has never seemed to shatter the
validity of my dreams and my aspirations
but to the other students I ruined the
status quo my narrative was being
written for me before I got the chance
to pick up a pen and it was the fact
that I didn&#39;t belong yet alone to had
words lace but then why isn&#39;t the case
that the law was that different what
made my perception change what maybe
spoke dehumanizes start connecting now I
may not be the Faulkner of poetry or the
Curie of chemistry but I do have a
theory one that I think will patiently
change our world as a society we often
are still the bitumen scrutiny of the
people and the things we don&#39;t even know
making these sort of face value
assessments with every stereotype and
every cliche in the book nowadays it
seems like it&#39;s impossible to look past
these preconceived labels see an actual
person well what if I told you that all
it took was the moments of courage to
ask the question and the willingness to
listen to the story
dating back all the way to the times
that Egyptian hieroglyphics and the
words of Socrates himself and the Lucian
has wired our brains to both listen and
to tell stories they&#39;ve been vessels for
cultural heritage they&#39;ve taught us the
morals and the values of those that know
or PDF it ever encompass the power of a
story is unquestionable and the common
thread in the fabric that is our society
is that you and I we are human so what
if we apply that same concept to our own
individual stories to the stigma of the
standard narrative
well maybe the assumptions we make of
one another that stemmed from the
statements maybe will disappear maybe we
won&#39;t see political agendas that one of
filled walls but build bridges maybe
will spread hope rather than fear we
will create the binary for our hilarious
whether it&#39;s Jamie&#39;s Thrones Leo Tolstoy
or CNN stories were made to bring us
together they were made to impart on the
lesson a message an emotion that not
only adds to our knowledge of the world
to our tolerance the one another so
speak to the overworked accountant of
the deaths the stress businessmen on the
plane
the fatigue taxi driver at the airport
terminal all it takes is a moment
courage the courage to ask and the
courage to listen because if we do this
one day the Laos dacha will thrive
instead of be repealed by an executive
order maybe instead of using missiles
and grenades to solve our wars we will
use stories to unify us because at the
end of the day it&#39;s the world that use
the
as differences tea at night that is
always going to be stronger than the one
that chooses to
