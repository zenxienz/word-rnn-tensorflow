today I need you to be afraid let me
tell you why and how we are changing the
world in wonderful ways with technology
but we are ignoring how much we are
changing ourselves to human
consciousness within a few generations
may be unrecognizable to us and that&#39;s
OK in itself it&#39;s happened before but we
need to build our new world with a
courage that comes from a special kind
of fear first let&#39;s consider the
magnitude of some of the ways we&#39;re
changing the world we&#39;ve entered an age
of supercharged information everywhere
as billions of smartphones and small
computers and sensors seek constant
two-way communication with giant global
computing systems just one of the
average sized data centers at my
employer Google cloud for whom I do not
speak today has in it enough computers
to build a tower 5,000 feet taller than
Mount Everest now we may be the biggest
one in the world but there are several
such facilities by several companies and
even more giant data centers going up
and this is wonderful artificial
intelligence in the cloud parses data
seeking new patterns and new
relationships modeling and automating
what had once been a painstaking search
for knowledge and new tools in the cloud
will enable people to build things
faster and better and that will speed
and democratize the ability to find new
knowledge if all art and Commerce and
science is based on pattern finding then
we may be on the verge of a new boom in
human understanding and perhaps the
greatest ever but that&#39;s just a small
part of how we&#39;re building the world in
new ways languages which subdivide
humanity can now be translated in a
single pair of earbuds genetic
information
life itself is a code that we manipulate
we make models and shapes and new
materials that could not exist in the
natural world and software that in
substantial series of if this then that
propositions doesn&#39;t just eat the world
it recapitulates it to model things in
new ways furthering our understanding
among today&#39;s speakers you will hear
visions of drones that deliver
essentials to any point of need on the
planet of revolutions in mapping our
brains and our oceans of the prospect of
living for centuries well that sounds
pretty good so how do I need you to be
afraid when you change the world that
much you change people too and we
already see it in small ways I know a
few of you right now are feeling a
little nervous because you haven&#39;t
checked your phones in a few minutes
getting word the latest urgency ten
years ago that anxiety would have been
unrecognizable to you or to anyone else
and if you checked your heart rate on
your phone have you livestream with
someone on the other side of the globe
has the world talked back to you through
augmented reality you would not even
have known ten years ago what to make of
such expectations nor would you have
understood a daily assault in your
personal media of the latest shocking
horror which we all in a desperate
gesture to cause it to end pass along to
our friends these examples are just
intimations of what we might become and
they could be tenuous
and they could lead us in entirely other
directions but it&#39;s a good bet that
within a generation or two will become
something entirely new and how we see
the world is that scary
not really it&#39;s happened before tech has
changed consciousness but usually by
chance the printing press came around
just content Constantinople fell
flooding Europe with new texts and these
were translated from Greek and Arabic
and
vernacular tongues not long after the
Venetian printers developed something
like the modern book just as fresh
wonders from the new world created more
hunger for knowledge an intellectual
piracy and printing boomed
so did translation 30 years later Martin
Luther became the world&#39;s first
best-selling author by translating the
Bible into vernacular languages he these
were on printed books that were created
faster than they could be burned and by
translating God&#39;s Word into their
tongues he translated the consciousness
of millions changing it forever a few
centuries later the French Revolutions
strange worship of Reason created a
passion for precise measurement and
precise kilograms and precise meters
merged with the vectors of the machine
age to create something else entirely
new identical factories capable of
creating identical products by the
thousand from this we got repeatable
goods that we consumed and repeatable
experiences of consuming the goods and
that led to brands and advertising and a
new world filled with desires and
factories changed the economy of how we
eat and sleep centuries of unruly
slumber became eight hours of precise
left breast the blank third of a
supposedly rational life so it&#39;s
happened before but this time we know
we&#39;re doing it and knowing it is new
Gutenberg didn&#39;t think I&#39;m gonna change
man&#39;s relationship to God and the French
Revolution didn&#39;t see themselves causing
a birth of brands but this time we know
we&#39;re changing consciousness we know the
pattern and knowing that we&#39;re doing it
that is new but the really strange thing
about that is it doesn&#39;t seem to slow us
down at all I once asked a well-known
tech billionaire do you and your
powerful friends ever think about where
all this is going do you wonder about
what the vectors of technology and
history might merge together and create
how consciousness might change what
could an age a perfect awareness mean
for the
consciousness of our grandchildren and
he looked at me and he said we can&#39;t
we&#39;re too busy building it of course he
couldn&#39;t he was a man firmly atop the
engines of his age he was loading up on
the latest tech and rushing to
out-compete his friends now a word on
the engines of an age it&#39;s interesting
but they&#39;re always run on invisible
forces and beliefs these might be
beliefs in a deity or in the course of
an empire or in the fate of a nation
ours invisible forces are the free
market and the scientific method through
them we we ask perpetual questions what
is the right price now what does the
customer want next what is the data
saying to us here what is the best
theory to explain that what can we do
that&#39;s new materially our invisible
forces have done more than Zeus or
Marduk or the fate of Rome ever did for
their people we have conquered disease
we travel continents by air
we have lifted billions from poverty who
could doubt that the endless questioning
of the scientific method or the Restless
hand of the free market the invisible
hand of the free market could be
anything else but something else unique
about the engines of our age and it&#39;s
not just that they&#39;re real everyone
always thought their invisible forces
were real our success is because we
dictate no final end we mandate no
heaven there will never be a final price
and there will never be a final product
and no one theory will encompass all the
data more data will always show up where
others had ends we inhabit that eternal
middle eternally improving and this has
given us material miracles by suspending
the final purpose by setting eternity
aside but it came at a cost
we have abundance
and but no one is likely to die for an
eternal middle the way they might die
for a flag or a deity and if there is
nothing to die for it&#39;s so much harder
to know what to live for and yet we&#39;re
still creatures of narrative we yearn
for a conclusion a judgement that weighs
our efforts and perhaps that&#39;s why so
many of us are sad or why we develop
ideas that artificial intelligence will
grow a mind so it will regard us and
judge us and kill us or why we feast on
catastrophe in our social media and then
pass it along in social Terror
with this horror we seem to say perhaps
surely the end is at hand but this kind
of fear is corrosive the fear I need can
be transformative fear is an awareness
that the world is changing that things
are happening that you may not
understand it starts in the primal fear
the sound in the grassland the shape in
the night the late call in this kind of
fear of the unknown we cling tight to
what we know now and we desperately wish
that nothing would change and we fight
to keep things the same but our
ceaseless world has become impressed by
this fear it&#39;s been abused too bad ends
in politics it&#39;s used to create urgency
at all times chasing out subtle thought
and deeper understanding in media it&#39;s
the thing that keeps you riveted and
powerless
many interests play on these fears
irrational hope that nothing will change
but it&#39;s bad for us and it&#39;s bad for
democracy which at its best means living
bravely with the unknown and our world
is changing
it&#39;s changing fast in ways that even if
they are abundant and good we simply do
not always understand but rather than
shrink in fear and hope nothing change
we need to embrace fear fear is also a
natural response that keeps a sharp and
it identifies to us what really matters
it prepares us for what lies ahead
even if we are unsure of what we may be
at the end of the experience reaching
into ourselves in fears the timeless
wellspring of real courage its
recapitulated throughout our lives we
find it perpetually you were afraid as a
child as you grew new emotions and you
connected with others and left your old
self behind an adult love is a kind of
fearful madness as you change your life
for someone change your fate not knowing
what Maya what may lie ahead for the two
of you when women give birth they
changed their bodies and fate for
someone unknown parents may throw
everything over that made tearily own
for their child there&#39;s always fear
there but it&#39;s overcome by a human
connection as yet unknown and there&#39;s
fear and a creative frenzy when you
yearn to touch a deep eternal truth
that&#39;s the knowing fear at the heart of
life everything may change it says come
with me almost nothing worthwhile or
lasting in our lives can be done without
this fear I&#39;ve known this fear many
times that the most important parts of
my life my father was a brilliant man
who developed Alzheimer&#39;s disease and I
was scared when I had to tell him that
his mind was going and he needed to move
into care towards his final death in an
exhilaration of fear I asked a woman I
had known only a few days to marry me
that was 30 years ago we were fearful
together at the difficult birth of our
first son and then a few years later
when he was diagnosed with an autistic
spectrum disorder that fearful awareness
and that desire to move forward is now
part of his story as he pursues his
Graduate Studies you nod we&#39;ve all felt
this kind of fear people say we learn
from our setbacks more than we learned
from our victories but I say we live
more richly when we allow for that
timeless fear to enter our lives and we
know that maybe there is no delivery
and maybe there&#39;s only change but we are
called upon to be brave the gods of the
ancient Greeks were like capricious
unruly children laying waste mortals for
no reason they could explain they were
slaves to urges even though they were
deities their world was one of chance
and chaos no matter what sacrifice or
caution or plan people made and thus
they lived like people at a storm at sea
and they were brave for each other on
the raft and in our pattern rich world
of abundance and wonders we all still
know and travel on such waters and what
will we do there we have to accept fear
and find compassion for others on the
raft and that is why I need you to be
afraid even the billionaire of the
eternal middles
must know fearful compassion as he loads
up on his technology we all must
everything will change and much unknown
lies ahead but we are always always
brave for each other and then even if
our grandchildren&#39;s mind and sight are
unrecognizable to us and ours to them
something timeless will remain between
us - thank you
you
