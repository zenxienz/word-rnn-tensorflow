can you remember what being bored felt
like I&#39;m talking about actual true
boredom nothing to watch nothing to
listen to nothing to tweet with it&#39;s
pretty much gone isn&#39;t it some people
pay to be bored nowadays they go to a
hut in Switzerland the Wi-Fi nor
reception then they milk some goats or
something but 30 years ago boredom was
completely free you could be bored
anywhere in any time because you didn&#39;t
have access to information like you have
today you don&#39;t have a smartphone or the
Internet this is our normal conversation
went down 30 years ago someone would ask
you something and you were like I don&#39;t
know and that was it
this is how most conversations ended in
the 90s we had to live with not knowing
things we couldn&#39;t just google them but
now it&#39;s exactly the opposite because
now we&#39;re flooded with endless amounts
of information all the time we now know
everything but we care for nothing and
this imbalance between the things we
know and the things were able to process
has created the biggest competition of
our generation I call it the race for
attention now there was always a
competition for people&#39;s attention but
the one thing that changed is the number
of competitors because back then it was
easy if you had something to say he just
took a bunch of money and you booked
airtime on TV and you could reach a
whole country but now it&#39;s a totally
different game because now you&#39;re
competing with anyone who owns a
computer there are kids on YouTube
who have a larger audience than most TV
channels so now anybody can enter the
race but only a few can reach the finish
line which in this case stands for going
viral but how do you go viral in the
last two years I&#39;ve managed to reach
about 250 million people using the
Internet I didn&#39;t make any money off of
it which is a shame but I did it all
from my home in my underwear and
theoretically you could - I&#39;m not saying
you will I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s not
impossible now the first time I managed
to catch the Internet&#39;s attention was
with a parody it was a parody of an
online music platform called boiler-room
now in case you&#39;re not familiar with
boiler-room what they do is they
organize parties all over the world and
then they stream those parties online
it&#39;s kind of like Ted but for DJs now
I&#39;m not sure why but there are millions
of people watching this this is very
popular so most of the times the DJ&#39;s
would play underground techno which I&#39;m
personally fine with but I couldn&#39;t help
but wonder how amazing those videos
would get if I were to replace the
original music with nineties trash hits
so I did I called it 90s boiler room let
me show you
[Music]
with freedom
[Music]
yeah yeah
this was a lot of fun but when I started
I didn&#39;t have any followers on Twitter
or Facebook that would spread my work I
did get lucky though because a
journalist from Vienna who was writing
for Vice found out about the project and
then they wrote this article here
yeah so after that that just started
spreading and you know people all
millions of people were watching those
stupid videos I made now remember how
this talk is called the secret of going
viral yeah that&#39;s totally a lie there&#39;s
no there&#39;s no secret to going viral come
on if I knew it do you think I would
tell you hell no but but I do believe
that there&#39;s a pattern behind many
things that do go viral
I think the success of an idea depends
on two things mainly an insight and a
mechanic now an insight is a word
douchey advertising people use to
describe a certain observation something
you would say that would make people go
like hmm you&#39;re right
I never noticed that but obviously
having some kind of observation is not
enough your observation has to be clever
or funny or original actually that&#39;s to
be all of the above let me give you an
example if I say something like the
story of Harry Potter is unrealistic
because he learns magic at school it is
an observation it is an insight it&#39;s not
a very good one because we all know that
I&#39;m not telling you anything new it&#39;s
not very surprising but if I were to say
let&#39;s say the story of Harry Potter is
unrealistic because he can actually use
what he learned at school in real life
you see this is a whole different
approach this is a whole new way to see
Harry Potter in your story and that what
that is what makes it funny to you this
is what makes it clever and original and
this is what makes it a good insight
every game-changing product every ad
campaign every good joke are based on an
insight and then there&#39;s the mechanic
which is simply the method you use to
communicate your insight which medium
will you pick what&#39;s your tonality
imagine the insight as a problem and the
mechanic as how you tell people
about your problem most people think
this is about solving problems it&#39;s not
art does not solve problems art exposes
problems art gets things started and
that is completely enough it&#39;s fine
because only after you&#39;ve found and
understood the problem you can try and
solve it so last year I noticed the
problem I saw people who were taking
selfies doing yoga
jumping juggling in the middle of
berlin&#39;s holocaust memorial those people
weren&#39;t doing it because they didn&#39;t
know where they were they know exactly
where they were they just didn&#39;t care
all they wanted was a pretty picture for
their Facebook profile and that was my
insight we are so obsessed with social
media we would literally dance on
someone else&#39;s grave or memorial without
even realizing now I didn&#39;t want to tell
people what to do I merely wanted to
show them what it was that they were
doing so I looked through thousands of
selfies that people were uploading
publicly to social media and I picked 12
of the most tasteless ones and then I
combined them with actual footage of
Nazi death camps and that was my
mechanic I had to come up with a name so
I took the word Yolo you only live once
which stands for this new kind of
ignorance you can see on social media
and the word Holocaust which stands for
dollar cost I called it Yolo cost then I
bought the website and on this website I
showcased the project but I also
included a message to the people whose
selfies are used if you want me to
remove your selfie no problem just write
an email to undo Shmi at yo loca study
I ended up reaching about a hundred
million people with this project and
after less than a week all 12 people who
selfies I used contacted me and asked me
to remove them so after one week I was
able to successfully and my project and
I thought it was nice to have a project
that actually ends in this very endless
Internet another good way of coming up
with ideas is having an opponent your
opponent can be anything it could be a
certain type of behavior it could be a
company it could be a regime and in my
next project I took up on a very big
opponent Twitter so a few months back I
got this really nasty tweet I mean I get
lots of those but this one was extra
juicy so I decided to report it I never
reported anything before on Twitter but
I was curious to see what would happen
and about a week later Twitter replied
they send me an email saying that they
couldn&#39;t find any violation of their
guidelines
in that tweet this is when I started to
question Twitter&#39;s approach towards hate
speech and that was my insight so I
conducted an experiment I reported over
300 racist homophobic anti-semitic in
Islamophobic tweets we&#39;re not talking
about insults we&#39;re talking about things
that are mostly illegal in Germany after
six months of reporting I think yet one
single email saying a tweet was deleted
and the vast majority of hate speech
just stayed online so I figured if
Twitter things I should see those tweets
maybe they should see them as well so I
showed them
I picked 30 of the 300 tweets and I
turned them into stencils then I drove
to Hamburg and I sprayed them right in
front of Twitter&#39;s German headquarters
[Applause]
Jesus you&#39;re too generous this is me now
some of you might ask why the warning
vest I noticed that if you wear one of
these you can get away with anything
people think you work for the city and
they will let you do anything you want
but relax it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
actual spray this is chalk spray so it
goes away very easily with water it was
gone after a day Twitter obviously has
not responded to my project but they did
inspire others to take action two weeks
later someone use projections to protest
against Twitter Twitter&#39;s policies at
their headquarters in San Francisco and
about a month later the entrance to
Twitter&#39;s office in Tokyo was full of
hateful tweets but sometimes it&#39;s not
even about the amount of time or effort
you put in because even the smallest
ideas can have lots of impact I&#39;ll give
you an example few months ago Donald
Donald Trump my favorite president went
on the first overseas trip of his
presidency and he kept uploading
pictures of all of his adventures to
social media which made the internet a
very fun place at that time we had lots
of fun it was it was humanness ok it was
great
he made the Internet great again yeah we
had lots of fun
so edits stopped in Saudi Arabia he
uploaded this picture now this picture
was already amazing the way it was don&#39;t
get me wrong I did feel like there was
something missing though so I fixed it I
uploaded this image to Twitter and with
only five minutes of work I was able to
reach almost 22 million people and even
this work is based on an insight I wrote
it right above the image you can add a
fictional villain to this image and it&#39;s
not even weird look I hope what I&#39;m
saying is helping you realize the
amazing potential of the times we live
in going viral is more than just a
marketing trick or a manual for cat
content this is about making your voice
heard if you have something to say
now&#39;s your chance there has never been a
better time and it doesn&#39;t matter if
you&#39;re going up against a multi-billion
dollar company or you just want to make
people laugh because you no longer have
to stand and watch from the sidelines
you can now if you have the right idea
you can use the internet to reach the
whole world from your home in your
underwear theoretically thank you
you
