first of all I was alerted to the fact
that not everybody may be familiar with
what is a zombie apocalypse so I thought
I&#39;d start with a primer what happens the
basic scenario is a large part of the
population dies and then comes back to
life for whatever reason walking rather
slowly and held within strange desire to
eat your brains or whatever else is
exposed what happens afterwards is a
complete collapse of the society lack of
food the electricity in turn outs and
then things go progressively worse as
described in this documentary that one
any fans in the room yay
I&#39;m on season seven so please no
spoilers if you haven&#39;t seen Shaun of
the Dead that gives us slightly lighter
take on the subject I see not too many
fans well do you have a good weekend
ahead of you
fine Shaun of the Dead so I&#39;m not here
to talk about the physiological aspects
of zombie-ism I&#39;m here to talk more
about what it feels like right
the usually zombie apocalypse sort of
happens pretty overnight um and the
world just changes from one day to the
next everything you knew just sort of
disappears it&#39;s all gone it&#39;s kind of
kind of really horrible and of course
you&#39;re completely unprepared and and the
best part is everybody is out to get you
they want to kill you and eat you or in
worst case scenario keep your life for
quite a while while eating you the
reason however why I want to talk to you
about it&#39;s because I find the zombie
apocalypse to be a very apt metaphor for
something that I think is coming and
coming quicker than we all think
technology driven disruption if you have
been in the States recently you will
have gone into shopping mall you would
have seen what Amazon has done to it and
if you&#39;re in the newspapers it really is
quite bad so frankly I wouldn&#39;t want to
be an interpreter a lawyer a taxi driver
for obvious reasons and so on and so
forth right when you compound the whole
thing with climate change also driven by
technology etc etc the scenarios become
really truly nightmarish right which is
why I&#39;m here to bring a message of hope
and the reason why I&#39;m I feel that I
have the moral authority and also some
experience to give you that message of
hope is because I&#39;ve lived through two
zombie apocalypses and yes that is the
correct way to spell the plural of the
world apocalypse
I&#39;ve checked let me first take you back
to 1984 give or take first of May Red
Square Moscow I&#39;m somewhere in that
crowd carrying a big pink fluffy paper
towel paper flower on a very long green
wooden stick I remember it like it was
today beautiful sunny day and as I was
walking down there with my grandfather
mr. Brezhnev that guy he waved right at
me and I waved at him and all was well
with the world and then fast forward a
few years forward then you end up in
1989 which is when the uses are as you
may have read in history books has sort
of ceased to exist it wasn&#39;t quite the
overnight change because they did take a
couple of years four years it&#39;s hard to
actually stop and for something else to
start technically speaking 1991 right
but fundamentally it was just like a
zombie apocalypse because for millions
and millions and millions of people who
lived in a country the country they
lived in just disappeared it used to be
called USSR and then it was called
russia tajikistan Azerbaijan Armenia
whatever gone deep the biggest and the
baddest evil empire in the planet
quite a few people were proud of that um
so you can imagine there was a bit of a
downer for them um worse than that their
jobs their pensions their future their
prospects the food and the store where
they used to go and get food all of that
just disappeared right and it&#39;s not just
that it&#39;s the lost it consequences of
that because now we&#39;re what twenty five
years down the road and there are still
millions upon millions of people who are
now in their 50s 60s 70s and 80s who
still haven&#39;t quite figured out what the
hell had happened and how on earth do
they keep on living in this strange
place that has none of the things that
were used to for the beginning of their
life right for me that one was pretty
easy I was 15 I just shrugged it off and
to give a bit of context was 15 my plan
in life was to go to university get a
PhD in some sort of a social discipline
be that I know psychology or perhaps
economics teach morons at some
University until I meet my untimely
demise
in a snow bank in Moscow with a empty
bottle of vodka in my hand at the ripe
old age of about 42 considering I&#39;m 43
today I did pretty good
so I referred for apocalypse um the
second apocalypse was not quite as
cheerful because at some point about a
decade ago I realized that I did not
want to be working for the man anymore
and I had to stop right there and then
and start doing something else and
become whatever it is I do today
entrepreneur and consultant and that was
exactly like a zombie apocalypse as well
except again no shambling dead nobody
trying to eat me but everybody out to
get me the tax man the accountant
everybody so it was quite hard it was
very hard on me it was also hard on
people around me again I&#39;m not here to
scare you
I&#39;m here to give you hope as I had
promised so let me talk about those
three essentials that you will need to
have in place to survive the zombie
apocalypse and actually the three
essentials you might want to start
working on already today so the first
one you will need is the new skills as I
stopped being a marketing guy and became
an entrepreneur I had to also become a
public speaker I&#39;m actually an introvert
and a pretty solid one and I&#39;m very shy
and I don&#39;t like hanging out with people
very much
you can imagine for me to be able to get
up on a stage at you know half-past
eleven in the morning without any
champagne whatsoever
it took quite some serious changes that
I had to make to my own personality it&#39;s
something you can do it&#39;s something that
takes effort it&#39;s something that takes
time and it takes dedication at least
now you know you&#39;ll have to retool
yourself in case of zombie apocalypse
well it would be useful to have a skill
for shooting people in the face really
fast running really fast and if you&#39;re a
fan of The Walking Dead also hot-wiring
cars really really fast think about what
your personal apocalypse is going to be
like and start getting ready for some
new skills
the next thing you&#39;ll need is a new
network because I think in the room
there is exactly one person who knows me
from my old life everybody else
everybody else who is who now I work
with with whom I spend my days and
cheerfully so I had to meet from scratch
so I had to do something called the
Startup Weekend Brussels that&#39;s the
first one that we did back in 2011 on
this photo there&#39;s quite a few people
with whom I&#39;ve done work since then and
quite a few of them who become very
close and personal friends so yes you
can do it that particular thing took
about six months of preparation and hard
work so if you know what kind of network
you may need when the apocalypse happens
to you when your job goes away start
working on that right now all right the
third one is is probably the hardest to
describe and the hardest to find it&#39;s
what gets you out of bed in the morning
all right it&#39;s something that used to be
being a professional market here that&#39;s
what my purpose was before now it&#39;s well
hacking Belgium together with the team
of really fantastic people and it took
me quite a while I think it took about
six or seven years of doing all kinds of
things some of which I&#39;m not to be proud
of I kept my pants on the worries
nothing illegal to find it is find what
it is that actually motivates me and and
I discovered that that is helping other
people find their way towards survival
after they&#39;ve lost their after they&#39;ve
gotten into the apocalypse in the first
place
thank you
[Applause]
