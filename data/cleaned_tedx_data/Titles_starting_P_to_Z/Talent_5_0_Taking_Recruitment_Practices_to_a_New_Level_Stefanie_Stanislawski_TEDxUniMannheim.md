anyway let&#39;s start this talk with a cup
of questions um do you think you could
ever find a job that was customized for
you for your needs for your skills for
your personality a job that would
actually satisfy all of your
expectations do you think companies
could get to know their employees so
well that they knew when they were not
happy and how to gratify them the answer
today is probably no we just settle for
what&#39;s out there but facts speak for
themselves only 13% of global employees
are truly committed to their jobs do you
imagine that 13% churn rate reaches up
to 25% in several industries and yearly
associated cost in the US only reaches
exceeds 500 million dollars through this
companies still use outdated practices
old processes and no tools nor relevant
data to respond to today&#39;s demanding
talent market today&#39;s time practices are
executed by people like you and I who
take high-stakes decisions based on
their own assumptions what is called an
unconscious bias and most of the time
reacting rather than proactively and
strategically answering to talent needs
which leads to rushed decisions and to
one third of new hires quitting their
jobs after only six months after study
the data of thousands of candidates I
started to develop an algorithm capable
of simplifying and quantifying elements
that companies believe were impossible
to handle or were only for
mathematicians to know let me show you a
graph the first line the orange one
shows someone&#39;s level of authority
challenge this is the personality trait
linked to someone&#39;s readiness through
challenged Authority and traditional
values as you may see the line started
quite low but raised as time passed the
blue line shows someone&#39;s level of
consensus Ness which is the personality
trait linked
success and according to several studies
it is the most important factor when it
comes to employment retention what can
we read from both well they show the
anal data of an employee before he flew
away as you may see he became more
challenging more aggressive as he became
careless now where does this data come
from from test apply to these people
know people can cheat on tests and you
probably know that so I figured out that
the way we express ourselves usually
show who we are in our state of mind we
use language in different ways and those
differences reflect our personality
studies have shown that even though our
choices are unconscious and spontaneous
they do reflect who we are there is a
direct association between keywords and
phrases and major aspects of personality
for example extroverts use lots of fun
related words like music and party
people with lower emotional intelligence
use negative words like angry and
stressed and narcissists love to talk
about themselves and use lots of I me
and myself but it is not only words that
I take into consideration the way we
communicate also plays a major role for
example a poor grammar shows lower
academic education absence of typos show
perfectionism and emoticons can be
assigned of friendliness if the document
is informal or immaturity if it&#39;s formal
long emails reflect energy chaotic
emails are a sign of creativity instance
responses show impulsivity and no
responses show a lack of interest so I
took what most of us use most of the day
work-related emails and chants and I
used the algorithm to help me identify
key words and trends behind employees
disengagement was it possible to predict
when someone was becoming detached and
if so how would it impact a company&#39;s
retention and recruitment strategy and
ultimately how could we help the
employees so far the algorithm uses data
coming from the candidates individual
answering trends so how long is he
taking to response compared to before is
he or she working late as she used to is
he working over the weekends like last
year it also takes information from the
market so how is the marketplace
impacting that particular role and
ultimately it uses text mining to
identify keywords and phrases to then
link them to a personality model that
uses common language descriptors like
the ones I showed you before
now when you mix all of this together
and over a period of time the algorithm
learns how that person behaved and it&#39;s
able to predict we&#39;re very high accuracy
when someone is becoming disengaged
based on their behavior and personality
now
all sounds really cool but my true
purpose has been to one help and help
companies develop their internal
business and their external talent
attraction and to to make the
recruitment process candidate friendly
by adapting it to each individual
personality evolving to a data and
predictive approach well facilitate
retention and recruitment and will allow
anyone involved in talent acquisition
which honestly should be everyone in the
company not only HR to know who&#39;s going
to be the best performer in the short
and long run and to customize the whole
process to each individual role and to
each individual candidate now all of
these sounds logic and barry of lifting
at least to me but all of these raises
questions about accuracy and privacy
nevertheless applying artificial
intelligence to the recruitment process
could insure more diverse and
static and dynamic workforces and
according to studies an algorithm could
increase the accuracy of selecting job
candidates by more than 50%
unlike how things are done nowadays
elements like your professional
background your social background your
cultural background your skills
assessments will be analyzed to know
you&#39;re the best candidate for the world
today because you will be able to
address the challenges associated to the
job but also the best candidate for the
company in the future making sure that
the career path also matches your
history and aspirations and it is not
only that algorithms are able to
probably address things better according
to studies and that people who dedicate
their lives to eat usually have lots of
information and probably more than any
bill the ones we can contain an
algorithm but the problem is that people
are usually distracted by things that
are only marginally relevant could apply
unconscious biases and usually don&#39;t
have the systems needed to analyze all
of the information in order to predict
what could work today but also in five
years time by getting to know people
better companies will also be able to
address retention since now they will be
able to tell who&#39;s becoming disengaged
before they leave they will have the
opportunity to react before it&#39;s too
late
either to retain that person or to find
a replacement on time let me give you an
example let&#39;s say Bob has been working
for X company for the past three years
but now he&#39;s getting bored because he&#39;s
millennial and he wants to make a change
but he doesn&#39;t have such a good
relationship with his boss so he doesn&#39;t
feel like talking about it and honestly
he doesn&#39;t see lots of opportunities
within the company so what happens now
Bob feels trapped and he starts to
change his response times is faster and
shorter
he changes his LinkedIn profile start
connecting with recruiters starts to
actively look for job applications he&#39;s
just different
when he finally decides to walk away he
just tells his boss who panics and runs
to HR and notifies about the urgent
vacancy HR starts to look for a
replacement after Bob&#39;s gone it takes
them about four to six months to find
one another two months to train the new
guy in the new meantime Bob&#39;s team are
asked to take more responsibilities and
workload so they get pissed and they
also get disengaged but once again no
one notices and this continues oh no
none I know it sounds crazy but I see
such things happening on a daily basis
in all sort of companies with this
solution the algorithm would be able to
identify the change in Bob&#39;s behavior
would send a notification to the boss
suggesting how to proceed based on who
Bob is and what he wants scary brilliant
you will decide but through this using
an algorithm in HR related processes
could allow the possibility of creating
predictive tile and pipelines since now
companies would be able to tell when
someone is ready to leave before they do
it
yeah the system could potentially inform
the recruitment team about skills that
they need to start hiring for and even
suggest a list of global candidates
analyzed based on success job factors
rather than traditional job descriptions
and static resumes
in a very short future things like
gender ethnicity or H will no longer
matter if you have what the job requires
then there should be no unconscious bias
in your way it won&#39;t matter if your boss
doesn&#39;t like you if you&#39;re a mother of
two or if you believe in the Mayan gods
if you have what it takes then the job
should be yours so with all of these
technology you might be thinking why
would a company need an HR team after
all trust me they will because this is
all about human connections after all
we&#39;re talking about our future here so
we&#39;ll want to know who the people behind
it recruitment nevertheless as we know
it will disappear it will evolve into
something that no algorithm will be able
to change and - yeah - take it will
become a strategic guy for the company
and a human element for the employees so
this means that using a statistical
model will replace hunches with data
presumptions with models first and
intuition with success reaches but the
final decision will be taking but a
human and not they leave it to an
algorithm this way in a very close
future companies will be able to retain
their talent longer will be able to
identify the best candidates faster and
at the same time us as candidates will
be able to identify and work in jobs
that we really want and that are really
aligned with who we are and that way the
question that I first asked you do you
think we could ever find a job that was
customized for us we&#39;ll turn in - yes
thank you
you
