for you and for you I&#39;ve got three
numbers nine-point eight seventy and
eighty let me explain United Nations
calculated that by 2050 this planet will
be inhabited with more than nine point
eight billion people seventy percent of
those people will be living in large
urban areas bringing huge distribution
challenges along but more scary
in 2012 eighty percent of the land
suitable for agriculture was already in
use if we look at our lives today we can
get whatever we want whenever we want it
we can buy sweet strawberries year-round
beautiful tropical plants to decorate
our living rooms or medicine which have
been made using plant material but what
we don&#39;t think of is the long distance
those plants have traveled they&#39;ve often
crossed multiple continents by boats or
by plane sometimes the transport need to
be refrigerated
all of this comes at a cost the cost of
losses during transports the impact on
the environment and the impacts on
plants quality if you look ahead towards
the future all nine point eight billion
of us living here in large cities where
will we find space to grow these plants
how will we distribute everything and
how will we feed all those future mouths
this actually made me ask why why
aren&#39;t you trying to find solutions for
this why aren&#39;t we optimizing this why
aren&#39;t we growing our plants more local
is because we cannot or climate isn&#39;t
suited for that particular plant or we
don&#39;t have enough arable land but just
deserts and snow but if we really think
it through we can use technology to make
this happen imagine being able to grow
any plants independent of the climate
imagine being able to do this using
ninety five percent less fresh water and
no pesticides no herbicides imagine not
needing to ship all these plants around
the globe anymore well I am here today
to tell you we can add urban crop
solutions we&#39;ve developed a modular
system which replicates any climates and
allows us to grow any plants and we&#39;ve
engineered the system based on the
plants needs and we&#39;ve developed and
combined several technologies to make
this happen
imagine crisp white warehouses and
plants being grown using LED lights LED
lights because they&#39;re more efficient
than traditional lighting they consume
less energy energy which can even be
obtained from renewable sources LED
lights are also cooler than traditional
lights allowing us to place light closer
to the plant
and cranes opportunity to grow multiple
layers above each other bringing farming
from a 2d to a 3d model I trained the
opportunity to transform any building
room or basement into a plant production
hub LEDs allow us also to control the
spectrum and their intensity and to
steer the way a plant looks its flavor
its vitamins or minerals or executive
compounds and don&#39;t get me wrong this is
not a genetic manipulation this is
actually creating an optimal plant
environment environment for the plant to
thrive like it&#39;s a sunny day without a
cloud in the sky of course when you look
in nature a plant needs light to grow
but also water and nutrients which it
absorbs from the soil soil which also
contains other organisms forcing farmers
to use pesticides and herbicides if they
want to guarantee their yields well
we&#39;ve removed soil from the equation and
statue grower plants and water and we
add nutrients needs to this water and
recirculated constantly so the plants
has his optimal levels as it grows it
absorbs these nutrients and water and
evaporates it this evaporated water we
capture from the air and you insert back
into the irrigation system reducing the
need for fresh water to a mere 5 percent
in comparison to traditional agriculture
besides water and light a lot of other
parameters need to be controlled as well
temperature humidity co2 air flow and so
on and during the last several years our
team of biologists have been
investigating these parameters for a
wide range of plants and what they
noticed is a plant as specific needs at
specific moments of its growth all these
needs and these parameters can actually
be placed inside an algorithm an
algorithm which allows anyone to grow
any plants by the touch of a button
we&#39;re actually translating the knowledge
which right now in farmers minds to a
smart software solution and these
algorithms also allow us to predict
yields and to grow just in time imagine
pharmaceutical companies
able to adjust a growth speed of their
plants when epidemic is rising the
potential here is big and the impacts
can be even bigger if all parameters
stay controlled this means also all the
risks should be managed and the biggest
risks these systems face are actually
external influences imagine you just ate
that sweet strawberry perhaps it
contains the bacteria you touch one of
these plants and the bacteria can spread
very quickly making us lose or harvest
of today tomorrow next weekend perhaps
two weeks after the week after deaths
and to manage this risk cost-effectively
we actually closed these rooms we over
pressurize them and we make sure as
little people as possible
can interfere with the plans environment
by introducing robotics in February 2016
urban crop solutions opened its first
automated vertical farm proving the
economic profitability of these systems
and as you can see a tower lifts that
move the trace around the system and
each tray here has also provided with an
RFID tag allowing us to track and trace
the plants from seeds to harvest
offering full transparency these
technological platforms allow us not
only to get whatever he wants whenever
he wants but from now on also wherever
he wants whether it&#39;s here in Antwerp in
Mumbai
or in Moscow there is a large automated
plant factories our small local growing
containers that&#39;s all of us optimize
supply chains let&#39;s minimize the impact
of transports and let&#39;s maximize plants
quality the technology is here
and now it&#39;s up to you thank you
