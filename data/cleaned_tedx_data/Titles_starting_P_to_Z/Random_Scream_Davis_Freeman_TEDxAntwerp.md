good afternoon the world is right now
quite a strange place especially if you
just think about the kind of violence
that we&#39;ve been surrounded by in the
past few years a person using a ak-47
just like this one in Charlie Abdul in
Paris and killing over 12 people dead
the explosion that happened in the
airport in Brussels people using cars to
go up on sidewalks and hit people and
Barcelona and London again somebody
using an ak-47 just like this and
killing 90 people inside the club in
Paris I mean the ongoing wars in Syria
and Afghanistan and what&#39;s happening
right now in the United States is a bit
surreal so it might be strange but what
I&#39;m going to do right now is to give you
a short tutorial about how to use these
guns because of this world of violence
that were surrounded by this world of
terrorism that we live in one of these
guns might happen to fall at your feet
and your life or the life of your
friends and family depend on it that you
know how to use it I hate guns but what
I teach you right now could possibly
save your life okay so this is the ak-47
it was made by Mikhail Kalashnikov in
1949 it&#39;s very reliable because it can
be covered in sand it can be covered in
the oil it can be completely covered in
blood and still you can always pull it
back and it will fire now in this small
tutorial I&#39;m just gonna share with you
two ways to be able to shoot the gun now
this lever right here if you push it up
that means it&#39;s in the semi-automatic
position meaning that when you pull the
trigger only one bullet comes out at a
time now if you put it down here
that&#39;s the fully automatic position
meaning if you pull the trigger all the
bolts will come out one by one by one
until you release your finger or the
cartridge is empty now if you were in
that horrible circumstance I would
recommend putting it in the fully
automatic position
and then hold it at a 90-degree angle
keep your hand on the wood part because
you don&#39;t want it to get burned and as
you&#39;re pulling the trigger and the
bullets are coming out one by one kind
of do a swaying motion of like a figure
eight so that then you can make your
escape to get out of there some way it&#39;s
very short I know now this is the
sawed-off shotgun now it&#39;s a bit
different than the the ak-47 as the
bullets that it shoots are shotgun
shells that are full of small metal
balls so when you shoot it it goes into
a very wide spray which could be useful
because if you have a large group of
women and children coming to get you
you can shoot into them and hit many of
them at the same time so again that you
can make your escape and get out of
there
this gun is actually an exact replica of
the gun that they used in the Columbine
shootings and the story came up that
they found one of the shoot one of the
students dead with this gun but he
wasn&#39;t one of the shooters and he was
like this now the story came up that the
shooters came in with all these guns
they would use them and then kind of
drop them and use them and go around the
corner and use them again but there was
this one brave student that saw that
they dropped this gun and he was under a
desk and he came over and grabbed it and
he tried to shoot them as they came back
but the safety was on so he got shot and
he died but now I can show you guys
where the safety is it&#39;s right next to
the pistol grip it&#39;s a small little
metal button that you push in and out
and if he had known that he could have
shot them and then prevented them from
killing seven other people but then he
didn&#39;t but now you know and the last gun
that I want to share with you is the UM
the pistol okay I stopped there now um
strategy number one the looks on your
faces right now are quite similar to the
looks of other audiences when I perform
this piece called what you need to know
it&#39;s mixed between shock and fascination
now understand while I&#39;m performing this
piece I have three
the answers behind me doing a
contemporary choreography and then I
offer the audience themselves the
opportunity to come up on stage and
shoot the gun yourself you know just so
that if you&#39;re in that horrible
circumstance that you could practice and
well you know so that then you have
something to aim at you can always shoot
one of the dancers you know you know cuz
it&#39;s good to have something moving so I
loaded up with theater blanks and then I
give them these shooters that always
come and I say okay so which of the
dancers would you like to shoot first
and what do you think they always say
it&#39;s the white woman every single time
you know some kind of political
correctness takes over their brain and
then in this circumstance they think
that maybe it&#39;s better to be a little
bit more sexist than actually racist you
know now I give you the experience of
this performance and share this fragment
because I just wanted to show you one of
the strategies that I use my
performances I am always trying to find
a way to project an audience into an
emotional situation that they wouldn&#39;t
normally find themselves in and maybe
it&#39;s a situation that you wouldn&#39;t even
want to be in or it makes you feel
uncomfortable but that&#39;s what I think
that art should do it should make you
feel uncomfortable you should challenge
your beliefs it&#39;s a challenge your
morals to make you discover where do you
stand I mean what do you believe in
would you come up on stage and shoot
that gun or not I mean I could even tell
you that whole story about the Columbine
thing it&#39;s not even true I just use it
as a tool for you to engage yourselves
so this is really like an anti-gun
performance that uses guns deviously to
give you that experience strategy number
two ladies and gentlemen the world
population is reached a staggering seven
point six billion people in the world
and every single day 350,000 people are
born but only
150,000 people died which is actually
too bad because that means every single
day 200 thousand hungry consumers are
added to this planet and we just cannot
sustain them all so what are we gonna do
how are we gonna make a more ecological
planet and support this growing
population especially as we have climate
change deniers that are in positions of
power well ladies and gentlemen we&#39;re
gonna do it by changing our behavior and
we&#39;re gonna change our behavior late
Nate now ladies and gentlemen not
because we&#39;re inspired by some great TED
talk we&#39;re not gonna do it because we&#39;re
inspired by some great work of art no
ladies and gentlemen we&#39;re gonna do it
because we are inspired by vodka yes
ladies and gentlemen I have no promise
to bribe you to make a more ecological
planet so what I&#39;m gonna do is propose
to you seven promises and for every
promise that you believe in you come up
here and you receive a button that says
I&#39;ve made a promise and you will receive
a free shot of vodka but maybe it&#39;s a
bit too early to be drinking vodka right
now but I just wanted to share this
other strategy that actually bribery
really does work so we throw out these
seven promises and people start to
reflect about their lives go to the
farmers market and cut down on food
miles cut down by carbon emissions by
not taking a plane for one year just
imagine I promise not to have children
for the rest of my life this also
creates some arguments between young
couples in the audience but I mean it
doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have children you
can adopt I mean they&#39;re all over and
one girl came up to me one girl came up
to me and said I made that promise a
while ago and now I haven&#39;t eaten meat
and I&#39;m a vegan for three years so just
by creating that opportunity you&#39;re able
to make people take action we&#39;ve done
this on the streets of Ganson people
signed up we do it to start parties we
do it for corporate gigs we even did it
once for international security
conference with ambassadors and
diplomats after a meal of champagne and
caviar which is a bit surreal but even
these guys were assigning up you know
making promises and taking these shots
so even bribery and maybe a little bit
of humor and a bit of healthy peer
pressure within the room make it
possible for people to change their
beliefs change their behavior and in
turn help change the world
though I must admit that sometimes
people get so drunk that they completely
forget their promises and then it
doesn&#39;t work all the time so it&#39;s not a
perfect system now strategy number three
my last one now if everybody would humor
me for just one moment very quickly
introduce yourself to somebody that&#39;s a
stranger right next to you okay just do
it right now introduce say hello but
your name mark my name is Davis nice to
meet you okay
all right so now I&#39;ve been invited here
because of a performance that I made
that one of the Ted people saw called a
better place and what I was doing I was
trying to contextualize a way that we
can let our ideas travel because you
know we are in a box right now inside
this this theater so I thought of this
idea that instead of asking everybody to
turn their phones off instead everybody
turn their phones on and then you open
up your contacts and you look for
somebody that&#39;s available in that moment
and then you pass your phone off to a
stranger and then suddenly you receive
this phone and then you you have to make
this phone call and say hello no no I&#39;m
this isn&#39;t kya this is erik and i&#39;m in a
performance and i&#39;m just here to ask you
how do you make the world a better place
and it&#39;s a very simple and naive
question but something beautiful happens
because then 155 people are spreading
around the theater in the bar having
these humorous engaged conversations
with people that they don&#39;t even know
you know
and finally we gather everybody back in
the theater and then we kind of think
about the ideas that people have raised
micro-financing seed bombing cities oh I
like the the universal make love our
that everybody had to make love at the
exact same hour I also like the one that
came up in in Tromso which was like
everybody in the theater the next day
had to buy all their fish from torva
which he was just like some kind of
local fisherman and you had to buy from
him instead of like the supermarket so
it definitely made his day better we
tried to always apply the ideas
ourselves and so in Antwerp we made a
vegetarian meal which then turned into
actually eating food for the future so
they were eating these insects and
mealworms and everything so by just
creating the opportunity these strangers
couldn&#39;t could connect either live or on
the phone to help realize an idea that
might have just been of
big thought before now just think about
that person that you just introduced
yourself with have a conversation with
them I mean who knows maybe that
conversation turns into some creation
that we&#39;re all embracing for the future
or maybe you just find somebody to do
your taxes I don&#39;t know now as an artist
I just I&#39;m more interested in raising
questions than actually giving answers
but I hope that you could be more open
to be subversive and devious and to look
at your ideas or projects upside down or
inside out or broken to a thousand
pieces use bribery whenever you can as
long as you don&#39;t get caught because you
can see that it works and think outside
of the box because it&#39;s just important
to connect to people outside of your own
zone out of your own first circle as I
hope I could share that even an artistic
performance can be much more than just
passive entertainment but a way to
inspire people to take a stand
challenge their beliefs and hopefully
contribute to make the world a better
place
now I&#39;m if anybody during this day would
like to make a promise and have a shot
of vodka with me well then let me know
thank you
you
