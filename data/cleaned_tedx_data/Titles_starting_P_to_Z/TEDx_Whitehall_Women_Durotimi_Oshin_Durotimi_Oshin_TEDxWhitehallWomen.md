Cinderella The Chronicles of Narnia
divergent ruby-red for what do these
things have in common they&#39;re all books
and I&#39;m going to explain how I believe
life is a book we determine what happens
in their lives the same way and author
determines what happens in the book we
create our own paths just as and all the
creates their own tales
therefore we create our own stories so
why do so many people go through so much
in life to change their story did you
know that 74 percent of goals for like
founder pressure to please everyone
or that 92 percent of teenage girls feel
like they want to change something about
themselves with body rate ranking the
highest so let me ask you this doesn&#39;t
author change that book because someone
doesn&#39;t like it no they don&#39;t so why do
you want to go changing your life
because someone doesn&#39;t like you you&#39;re
the only one who can determine your
story not your mother your father or
your neighbor living off the road from
you you and only you had the power to
write your own story never change your
story or yourself just because someone
doesn&#39;t like you it&#39;s the that&#39;s is what
makes you unique and that&#39;s the
fantastic Joe reading because every book
is different it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s
in the same series or is written by the
same author every book is different just
how every human being is different so is
there life look Nathan W Morris once
said life&#39;s too short to live someone
else&#39;s or how I like to put it life&#39;s
too short to tell someone else&#39;s story
you only have one chance at life one
chance at telling your story before I go
I&#39;d like to leave you with the words of
a favorite childhood hero if ever there
is a tomorrow when we&#39;re not together
there is something you must always
remember you&#39;re braver than you believe
stronger than you seem and smarter than
you think
