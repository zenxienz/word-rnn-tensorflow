today approximately one in every three
adults is overweight or obese already
one in every six children is suffering
from overweight overweight or obesity
and that means that these people are at
risk for getting diabetes cardiovascular
diseases are even dying at a younger age
making healthy food choices is key to
reduce this obesity crisis so let me
start by asking you a question and I
would like to see hands who if you likes
to eat healthy
lots of hands are raised okay
very clear but then why do we still have
this obesity and overweight problem okay
that that might not be completely fair
to ask let me ask you a different
question who of you believe sets vitamin
C is healthy I would like to see hands
again lots of people believe vitamin C
is healthy and if you now would have to
choose between the orange juice or the
orange to make the healthy decision who
if you would go for the orange juice
not too many enthusiasts who he would go
for the orange lots of hands for urines
that&#39;s very clear but if I were telling
you that&#39;s on the label on the container
of the orange juice it says that it
contains vitamin C we just established
that fundament C was healthy right is
anyone inclined to switch no not really
not really this is fascinating to me and
as a food scientist this decision is
actually what wonders me each and every
day but I&#39;m increasing the difficulty
you just had to select between an orange
and orange juice what if you would have
to still
the healthiest option between
blueberries and goji berries who if you
would go for the blueberries lots of
hands for the blueberries okay what
about the goji berries then and if I
tell you that these are superfoods are
there than more hands for the goji
berries still not really the blueberries
wins okay I&#39;m increasing the difficulty
one more time if you would have to
select the healthiest option between a
lights Coco drink and dark chocolates
who few would go for the light Coco
drink I see a few very very fanatic
supporters of Coco drink but for the
rest is it dark chocolate um can I see
hands for dark tell we are talking about
the healthiest option right not the
tastiest okay but still a lot of people
would go for the dark chocolates it is
hard to make a healthy decision you saw
that we already didn&#39;t completely agree
here making this healthy decision each
and every time you&#39;re in the supermarket
with all these labels shouting your name
telling them telling you how tasty and
how healthy they are that&#39;s difficult so
maybe this obesity crisis isn&#39;t that
surprising after all as a food scientist
I already told you that I&#39;m fascinated
by this every day I&#39;ve been studying
food law and food sciences for the last
five years and I wonder always about
when can you actually say that a product
is healthy that is good for you why
would a product be allowed to tell you
that so let&#39;s go back to the orange
juice the orange juice has on its label
that it contains vitamin C that&#39;s that
it&#39;s a source of vitamin C and that&#39;s
actually based on food law and food law
make sure that this is based on solid
scientific evidence so this remark about
this healthy ingredients which we agreed
upon it is
healthy also science agrees upon that
and that&#39;s why food law would allow such
a product to bear this claim you can
read on the label that it contains
vitamin C so this base of solid
scientific evidence makes sure that it&#39;s
true so curly fries would never be
allowed to tell you that you would get
curly hair from that believe me I&#39;ve
tried and this is purely from the
hairdressers so it doesn&#39;t work like
that
so I love food law for that because it
makes you it allows you to make a
healthy and informed choice but it only
tells you something about the vitamin C
content and is this the complete picture
well I doubt that it is only one slide
off the container one part of the
container and you have to turn the
container around to see that it doesn&#39;t
only contain vitamin C of course it
doesn&#39;t
it contains way more nutrients so you&#39;re
also consuming different other nutrients
along with that and in your glass of
orange juice you&#39;re actually drinking
four sugar cubes as well in one single
glass so it&#39;s not the full picture
you&#39;re getting from the claim you have
to turn the package around to see the
full story and this is almost like where
we would test medicines only on their
health effects but we would completely
leave out the potential negative effects
we only focus on one elements and that&#39;s
not completely fair I believe because if
you consider this orange which also has
vitamin C which also would offer you
fight him and see but it is not on the
label you would only consume to shoot
cubes of sugar so it might be the
healthier option so how do you then do
this well there are some suggestions
made in food laws already to only allow
completely
healthy products to bear such claims
that if you&#39;re in the supermarkets and
you&#39;re looking for these labels and you
see these statements that they would be
only allowed on products that are
healthy already anyways but that&#39;s quite
difficult still because it&#39;s not only
about that single products to see
whether it&#39;s overall healthy based on
it&#39;s sugar content or its fat content
and the salt content combined but you
don&#39;t just drink one glass of orange
juice of course maybe you take it with
breakfast you probably eat a sandwich
with it but you eat multiple meals a day
so it&#39;s not that easy to label one
products to be overall healthy or to be
overall unhealthy so we&#39;re not there yet
in my research I try to find different
ways to deal with this to keep on
improving food law so for today we just
analyze the healthiest option I would
advise you to go for the blueberries
food science would also advise you to go
for light products but if you would go
for dark chocolate I&#39;m very sorry to
have to reduce the pile to approximately
20 grams a day to get only the health
benefits from dark chocolates so for
today these healthy options for tomorrow
you know where to find the information
now you can turn this container around
to get the complete picture and for the
future I will contribute to make food
law work for you thank you
