I match this you are surfing and a
turtle comes up to you and starts surf
with you
well that has happened to me and it like
I was special because when I got to the
sand what everyone was looking at me it
ran away because it was afraid that
everyone was gonna hurt it this made me
think about the dangers that sea turtles
are facing according to the website
Treehugger 4,600 sea turtles are killed
by fishing each year now you might think
that&#39;s not much but what about in 20
years that&#39;s 90 mm sea turtles kill so
we must stop this before it gets out of
control
also according to the website Science
Daily the Kemp&#39;s ridley is the most
endangered sea turtle and there are only
1000 missing females left according to
the website nice mellow calm sea turtles
are afraid of fire and anything out
there that habitat so maybe I could
teach people that we need to keep away
from this stuff I want to make a website
that will show everyone what I&#39;m talking
about
I mean like pictures of how the world
will be when sea turtles are gone trust
me once you see how sea turtles affect
your lives you will want to help them
like I do according to the website
Science Daily the leatherback sea turtle
will be extinct in 20 years if this
condition keeps up there will not be any
sea turtles of any kind sea turtles are
important to me and the world sea turtle
help people see you guys healthy see you
guys helps keep fish healthy and we fish
so in a way sea turtles are helping us
so we should help them although many
Fisher&#39;s in the u.s. are trying to
reduces problem by making la Seine you
are not allowed to fish in some places
where sea turtles might be and by making
special nets that allows turtles to
escape on their tracks but what about
the other fishers in the world
just a few is still not enough to save
turtle so I&#39;m going to
I hope that one day all Fisher&#39;s around
the world will be able to use these nuts
and make these roles to help turtles
from going extinct one kid can make a
difference but a small one if you all
helped me it can make a big and maybe
even huge difference so will you make
the right choice to save the turtles
habitat use these nuts and make these
roles
