the reason I kept doing research on
social media and what I thought was
there&#39;s a lot of like notice was is that
people keep goofing off you know they
keep messing up I do as well it&#39;s
struggling that you know there&#39;s we have
the noise of giant car we have to take a
test but we can just go buy these phones
and we&#39;re off we make all these errors
some of them were aware of because we
find out the following day we might lose
our jobs or various people might respond
differently to the things we do but
there&#39;s lots of other things that we
might not see and I&#39;ve seen all these
things
I&#39;m studying social media so if we go
back to the good old days and the good
old days I&#39;ve got these communities here
I didn&#39;t actually have to hear if
someone was being rude or horrible
because they were doing in their house
I&#39;d be walking past their house I
wouldn&#39;t have to see them I hear about
it on social media the other thing is is
we used to always be editing top-down
news there were virtually channels and
we all went to work or went to school
and we discussed the same kind of
programs that we have on the wall today
I&#39;m going to say in the group today&#39;s is
we can go off with little wormholes and
we don&#39;t connect possibly as much when
we arrive at school or worried about the
workplace because we don&#39;t have
different interests and we&#39;d focus on
those interests and we don&#39;t rely so
much on the top-down media now it&#39;s not
all grim what we found in our research
was that I mean I&#39;ve been studying this
go to the pen
there was a wonderful post online where
we could find out about government
publications we could find out what
different sides were thinking and he
found out things that you might not have
come before you could see what academics
are up to about their latest researches
and some actually is an advocate an
educational tool and resource it&#39;s been
absolutely fantastic if you know where
to look
we also our research found that you know
it&#39;s a minority activity less than 5% of
a post out there tend to have some of
the bad features that I remember talking
about today but what we do know is that
government and schools and political
parties are increasingly interested in
what can we do about this there are
several Commission&#39;s Pretty&#39;s involved
in investigating these things right now
that I&#39;ve been involved with local
Spanish Palmer
next week to talk about this too and so
I did is I came up with kind of X to
avoid 5s to avoid and then try us to be
aware of it and I&#39;d like to take you
through those today so it&#39;s good maybe
another f-type this afternoon I&#39;m going
to start with a quick recap of the 5s to
avoid the first one is the famil
probably the one we all don&#39;t like
getting if someone is swearing tweeting
back and being nasty the sow also
includes this is a recap because you&#39;re
giving a greatest hits 10 my total one
cover these five points but I&#39;d like to
talk about all of the greatest hits of
things that I&#39;ve ever talked about today
including another 5 on s to think about
so the foul talks about bad language but
it was
we&#39;re talking Whittle controls were
talking bullying we&#39;re talking in fact
behavior online which none of us want to
be in receipt of flaming is when we go
over the top we often use lots of
uppercase language we use exclamation
marks multiple exclamation marks
multiple question marks
lots of uppercase slaving language we
can all probably think of a leader in
false and fake we need to think about
false just because one gem if you find
one gem that does an action or one curse
of a gym that you take as an action it
doesn&#39;t mean that all of that gender
drive like that or like that the same is
true with just because you spot one
English person who is really horrible
it does not mean that all English people
are horrible
so we need to avoid kind of these
fallacious hopes where we find one thing
that we don&#39;t like and then we
aggregated up to that group and then
also this connects with the whole idea
of folk use is actually what we&#39;re what
we&#39;re doing or spreading if you cared
about come back to this idea for a
moment we talked about fasting a little
bit more detail the floppy one of my
friends this week got it
she said I was told I had sick hair
online I don&#39;t know what this means and
some of the younger generation practice
that actually that means you&#39;ve got
really cool haircut it&#39;s what it&#39;s sick
is the way of saying so but that doesn&#39;t
if you&#39;ll save to something they&#39;ve got
sit hair there might be people online
generations reading damage it&#39;s just a
really cool haircut slow thinking about
you meet with your violets okay with
your little rooster to communicate with
set language if you want to step one on
stand each other I mean I make up words
do you know what family leaflet means
know what it means to me is it&#39;s 50
percent fabulous and fifty percent
delinquent so it&#39;s fabulous with a touch
of naughty and I quite like that word
and I use it all the time with my
friends but I am NOT post something on
social media totally our talking about
how fabulous I am
my god yes whatever you&#39;ll see this
manner and so be careful with Bobby when
you&#39;re communicating with people flower
right now is when you just go on and on
and on at the same point and what we
noticed was that people do not like it
when people make the same point over and
over and over
particularly one person who would never
serve said okay I&#39;m at this point 21
times I will not make it again and then
five minutes later they came in and made
it again so that can really annoy people
if you if you go on and on and on
actually there&#39;s probably leaders in the
world who do all these things all the
lives today I&#39;d like to focus on the
apps to be aware of so this come as the
first part like to look at its followers
and followers in the United Kingdom for
example we have 53 million people living
in England and 5.3 they of living in
Scotland so it can look if you&#39;re on
that website like the BBC and you&#39;re
having a discussion in you&#39;re posting
comments on the hackers safe thread on
the BBC it can look if you&#39;re living in
Scotland like you are completely out of
it tend to work and that is just if
there is a proportional response now if
there are a ratio of 5 to 2 it can still
look like a scholarship account number
by the English well actually there could
be a disproportionate in terms of
population response from Scottish
population versus the English population
so we need to think about population
numbers we need to think about all the
different types of followers that are
out there so when
attaching a comment to a hashtag who are
the people who make up that hashtag so a
hashtag indira hashtag EU read all of
these mixtures of 50 50 groups of people
or I&#39;ll explain or ten to one what is
the ratio of farmers that are taking
place this also happens with our
Facebook accounts we probably order and
most of us but what we have Facebook
accounts which are imbalanced
politically we there&#39;s probably very few
of us in here who have you know half my
friends on the left and then half of my
friends are on the right we probably
have imbalances and if we don&#39;t have
imbalances we make imbalances by the
choices and the things that we click on
where we might serve the articles which
can be that these algorithms take us
down to these imbalances so even if
we&#39;ve got our balance set of friends we
don&#39;t have about set of new stories
that&#39;s coming our way because the things
we get to see other things that we think
that the media companies think that we
might like so we might end up even
though we try to balance we might end up
with imbalance of our followers the
second one is facts and what was really
interesting about the special pence
referendum was that the two groups that
were interviewed the big books and focus
groups tone as well and two of the
groups though the activists yes
campaigners the actors no campaigns
there would be general no voting this
general yes vote of support of the
groups but what they all wanted were
facts and they all found these facts in
different places some people found facts
on websites that they were approved of
and other people disliked other news
organizations because they didn&#39;t like
facts proceedings so different people
found facts in different places but
everybody thought that they could find
that and I think we need to be really
careful here and if you think about the
ERF we you know in the UK we have the
big promises
you know we&#39;re spending 350 billion
pounds on Europe every week but the
cancer what we need to do is that the
counter-argument and work out well do we
get any of that 350 back in the form of
structural funds grants and so on and we
need to be doing this constant fact
checking and cross-checking maybe
reading a left-wing paper reading a
right-wing paper looking at what people
on different sides are saying about
these particular issues to try and work
out what is the fact of what is no
effect and even though we think we&#39;ve
got a fact we might also want to think
about long term arrangement facts we
might know what the auto prices today we
might be making a voting choice based on
the oil price of today but let the oil
prices over the last 10 years or over
the last 20 years what could happen
tomorrow might not be situation to
develop and do the political parties
tell us what these worst-case scenario
versus best-case scenarios are when
we&#39;re making our particular choices
about the ballot box so think really
critically about facts that you&#39;re
receiving the next one fashion and this
is the idea that just because loads of
people online are loving everything you
do liking what you are doing it doesn&#39;t
mean that they are representative of the
population and you might actually just
be attracting a small bubble unclean
people they may not be representative of
the other groups that are in society so
the group they&#39;re up to might actually
be in a majority when it comes to public
opinion but when it comes to online the
fashion was suggested online that group
is larger so in my research we looked at
the top two lines there and came to
Facebook data across a lot in campaign
especially independence referendum and
you can see the top line there is for
Facebook Likes
for the yes side yes to an opponent the
second line there that I&#39;m going to
focus on the bottom two likes to do with
Twitter and there was similar kind of
ratio shoot the top two lines but the
top two lines that showed that the yes
side was ahead of line and it searched
the head online during the campaign
period and another independent side did
not do very well online but actually the
result was 55 no two independents and 45
years through the pattern so the result
did not mirror the fashion of what was
taking place online so we need to be
careful about the difference between
online public&#39;s and offline public&#39;s
because they may not be the CERN the
next one let&#39;s talk about us filtering
and this can be search filtering so
there might be certain groups in society
who feel vulnerable and they do not wish
to partake online in social media
because they do not feel that they&#39;re in
a safe space so some people might feel
more safe to comment than others and we
need to look at ways we can try and make
spaces safe so that different groups
can&#39;t get involved this might be
different nationalities who fear that
their states will persecute them if they
return
partaking online and talking about
things of interest to them that might
not cause us grief in the West it might
also be that we are constrained we are
filtered by and what I&#39;ve searched
showed when we were looking at lumbus
forum spaces where people could talk
they were able to talk about the issues
when you&#39;re confined to 140 characters
this can have a filtering effect that
means you cannot do more that talk about
whether you agree with somebody or
disagree with somebody and you can&#39;t go
into the issues in the kind of depth
that you want to go into and unless
you&#39;re kind of wrong with those twins so
we need to think about what kind of
platforms we&#39;re engaging with what are
the rules of engagement that they tell
us we will be included or excluded
what&#39;s the space we could talk in and
also our lyrics out there that are we
hearing from because they don&#39;t feel
that they can get involved so that whole
area kind of spiral of silence maybe
some groups aren&#39;t getting engaged
the final one I&#39;ll talk about is fall
hour and let&#39;s fall out here for the
person making the nasty comments or are
getting engaged they might lose their
jobs they might lose respect that might
lose their families whatever else if
they really mess up online but it&#39;s also
the people that they are doing this to
would we bother we need to think we&#39;ve
heard a lot about empathy severe I think
empathy and kind of also heard about
kindness these are important things to
think about and when we are engaging
online we need to think about how we can
be empathetic how we can be kind so that
none of us want to be in a position
where we are crying why do we want to
make other people feel bad or in that
particular position and then there&#39;s
also the fallout in terms of are the
lectures of our policies and the
mentions of the parliaments that
represent us I&#39;d look like us to have
Parliament&#39;s that represent us according
to all the different groups that are in
society it&#39;s some medicines
some members
are increasingly not wanting to stand as
political candidates if women are
perceiving that they get more attacks
online than them and I research showed
that they did get more negativity the
men as well it&#39;s not just the perception
it&#39;s a reality then we might be in the
situation where fewer women are standing
for probable I don&#39;t want to be an
opponent I don&#39;t want to be represented
by a parliamentarian who are just who
only include the hard-nosed people who
do not mind if they get these online so
we need to seriously think about what we
are doing to our societies and to our
policies very very finally I&#39;d like to
talk about if you&#39;re facing a crisis or
you&#39;re in a drama
we all know that you probably shouldn&#39;t
drink and drive drink and drive you
probably shouldn&#39;t drink and dial a
famous film and I&#39;m just going to add to
that if you&#39;re doing dramatic digit if
you&#39;re doing you might have digit as you
do drugs
this is interesting pictorial format so
if you&#39;re flipped a slightly losing it
you&#39;re getting it at meri if you&#39;re
fried you&#39;re away with the fairies or if
you&#39;re furious or we can have tipsy t32
in ten tweeting totally lost it tweeting
you might want to engage with another
activity indeed I think we probably all
need a digital detox I get involved
I do voluntary work in the local garden
this is my car and it is nice to do
something other than just social media
and this makes me happy as well gives me
a bit of balance the ion irony of this
is though that my god never
if I didn&#39;t have a social media platform
to share it out because I&#39;ve got people
to like my god
so the irony is I&#39;m engaged in the good
old days but it&#39;s all connected to the
good two days with a good two days can
be today
