two years ago I decided to deactivate my
Facebook account
because I thought I needed a break from
social media but recently I discovered
that the break was way too long I felt I
was missing out it was only a matter of
days after write reactivated my account
that I received a very special friend
request it was from a very handsome and
I should add photogenic French guy I
didn&#39;t need to think much about whether
I wanted this handsome fellow on my list
few minutes later I got a message from
him think bozo sever and I replied
Bonjour savage WA sever Jemma pan
jean-pierre heading to the English
version now I&#39;m a French medical student
living in Europe what about you
my name is nour no cute name what does
it mean it means light in Arabic
interesting so you mean like you light
up people&#39;s life
he laughed no seriously what do you do
in your life miss light as much as I was
happy because the guy had a sense of
humor I found myself confused because
for the first time in my life I didn&#39;t
know how to answer on such an easy
question like seriously
Who am I am I the designer the student
nor the sketcher the painter or even the
musician and instead of telling a long
description about myself I decided to
choose one single world which I truly
believe represents me well artist and I
replied I am an artist
to be honest I was expecting a very
witty and a funny reply but this time
jean-pierre decided to surprise me and
he replied with so you mean like you
scratch some irregular lines on a blank
paper and I thought to myself scratch
some lines on a blank paper like
seriously I had many replies in my mind
some of which I probably inappropriate
to utter at the moment but I kept my
cool you know artists are known by their
very sharp answers and we call it in
French lock demo so I decided to live up
to that and I said yes that&#39;s true
that&#39;s exactly what I did when I was 6
years old a regular lines as my Nissan
and plenty of failed atoms of vases and
footballs but I&#39;m 24 now so let me fill
you in on what has happened since mr.
jean-pierre my name is north the girl
who grew up to become an interior
designer and current architecture
student as sketcher and a painter who
want several international competitions
including ones from your country my name
appears as a volunteer artist in many
therapy programs
a musician who knows how to play the
flute piano and violin and cello student
a music teacher in several Institute&#39;s a
women rights advocate and speaker my
irregular lines and I have moved so far
in life unlike yours who seems to be
stuck in time refusing to evolve
sounds mean right while I was waiting
for such a mean and a harsh supplier
from Playa suddenly his beautiful
profile picture was gone and the fancy
name of Jean Pierre turned into a
Facebook user and at this moment I
realized that I was totally blocked by
this person but believe me or not
he was so satisfied because for the
first time in the life of someone like
Chantal he was finally confronted with
what the term artist truly means you see
I grew up with art everything in my life
has involved around art it has been
included and almost everything it has
been a part of my education my designs
my sketches my paintings my music and
even as a part of a therapy I provided
some people you know you don&#39;t need to
be an artist in order to evaluate art in
the right way instead all you need is to
have an artistic mindset where you can
reach the point and ask yourself one
easy question how would my life turn out
without art simply and I remember once I
got an exam question that I had to
answer and instead of writing a very
longest day I decided to give the paper
and as a way to show that my life with
no word will be totally blank
like this paper so I wrote down my name
with my ID number and gave it to my
professor
but unfortunately my professor didn&#39;t
get the art behind the blank paper and I
ended up getting a zero and I remember
that day when I came back home to tell
my father about what happened and
believe me or not
he was so happy because for the first
time in his daughter&#39;s life
she actually translated her ideas into
art and he told me a secret that I will
be very happy and proud to share it with
you but it&#39;s a secret so don&#39;t tell
anyone and he said the moment you start
appreciating art is the moment you can
start to live your life in the right way
is it that possible
well absolutely I seem to obsessed with
art and extent that I wrestle with many
what-if questions have you ever thought
about what if the art of Romeo and
Juliet has never existed what would have
happened to many lovers who took Romeo
and Juliet at the role models how would
many love stories another pieces of art
including stories and movies have ever
ended what if the voice of Phaedrus was
never present as in Lebanese and Arab
cadaver morning coffees to taste the
same
can you imagine traveling to Paris
without admiring the beautiful Eiffel
Tower and what if Dixon deserts whereas
just as boring as a mixture put into the
oven and served just as they come out no
I think no kind of red resin on the top
not even a proper presentation of the
plate food is an art one that I&#39;m
particularly fond of and what if fashion
and our sense of style were almost
identical to that of everyone else how
will you express yourself how would you
reflect your unique individuality
without that black pearl necklace those
bald rates led to shoes or even that
Monsieur bond yes I am an artist but I
do not need to be mysterious or have
those wild colored hair or to have
piercing and tattoos all over my face
and body for you to see that I am an
artist I am an artist because of the way
I choose to lead my life
view my surroundings expressing my ideas
and my visions you do not get to label
and stereotyped me based on what you
conceive artists so how will you figure
out who an artist is or who knoweth all
you need to do is ask and if I like you
enough maybe I will answer you or even
give you a glimpse of the aesthetic
world I live in I doubt I&#39;ll get to chat
with young players again but should
another jump desk come across my profile
I make sure to ask him to take a look of
what status I write and what photographs
I post so that he wouldn&#39;t even need to
ask what do you do thank you
