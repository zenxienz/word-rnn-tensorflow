i I always think you know a photo is
worth a thousand a thousand thoughts I
mean it just and in a video must be
worth a million so I stand here today as
a mother a wife an athlete a cancer
thriver
and a storyteller so I&#39;m gonna you saw
what I did right and I&#39;m gonna tell you
kind of how I did it I&#39;m hoping to be
able to tell you how I did it in 2002
one of my nieces came to me and she said
she was gonna go run the Chicago
Marathon and I thought I am the athlete
in the family and if she&#39;s gonna go run
that marathon I&#39;m gonna go with her and
I&#39;m gonna run it faster and so she and I
take off to Chicago and rerun the
marathon and I hate to tell you that I
did take her down bad there you go so I
went on to run a few more marathons and
I qualified for Boston and in 2006 I&#39;m
on the treadmill I&#39;m trained for boss
and it&#39;s a Sunday afternoon and the
Ironman program world championship comes
on the television now this show features
the professional athletes the elite age
groupers and then it&#39;ll take maybe four
or five inspirational stories from
around the world and they&#39;ll tell those
those athletes stories in this
particular year the story that just it&#39;s
stuck with me was about a gentleman
named John blaze and this man was in his
early 30s and he had ALS or Lou Gehrig&#39;s
disease and he had left-sided weakness
but it was his let&#39;s say make-a-wish his
dream his goal was to do that World
Championship and he said no matter what
even if he had literally crawled to the
finish line or roll across the finish
line he would do that and so that day 16
hours into the race he&#39;s coming down the
finishing chute and he comes up to the
finish line and he literally gets down
any log rolls across you know his
parents came and they laid down there
with
and the tears just came down my eyes and
did this day there are pro athletes and
age groupers that will log-roll in his
honor
he left this legacy he passed away a
year later it&#39;s amazing but I saw that
and I thought to myself I want to do an
Ironman so I quickly went upstairs told
my family I&#39;m gonna do an Ironman and
they looked at me I know what they were
thinking she&#39;s crazy
right I thought you know what I&#39;ve
always been a little crazy so this is no
different and that&#39;s what I did
2008 I went to Louisville Kentucky and
did my first Ironman in case you don&#39;t
know an Ironman is a triathlon a
triathlon is three sports swim bike run
there&#39;s four distances an Iron Man&#39;s the
longest 2.4 mile open water swim 112
mile bike and then you run a marathon
26.2 mile run and people will ask me you
mean you do one of those in a day right
like three days like no no no all in one
day so I go to Louisville and I do my
first Ironman and I end up coming up
fifth in my age group and the fourth
place woman qualified for Kona for that
world championship so I thought hmm I&#39;m
having that little competitive spirit
that I mentioned earlier you know maybe
I could do this maybe I can be better
maybe I could qualify and that became my
dream or my goal I took that year and I
really focused on my training something
wasn&#39;t right
I just didn&#39;t feel I don&#39;t know I just
didn&#39;t feel up to see I thought well
maybe I&#39;m a year older
maybe I&#39;ve over trained I had a foot
injury that wouldn&#39;t heal and then I
started having some bleeding when I went
to the bathroom now if any of you have
seen a road bike or a tri bike the seat
that we sit on is literally about that
big right so I see out there and I
thought well you know I&#39;m riding 100
miles at a time anybody that&#39;s sitting
on that little seed not probably other
people are having issues too so I kind
of chalked it off but I did say after I
finished the race if I&#39;m not feeling
better I&#39;ll go see a doctor and that&#39;s
what I did September 18 2009 two weeks
after I finished that second Ironman I
woke up from the colonoscopy and in the
snap of a finger my life whole life
changed I knew I had cancer in my
calling they sent me off to have some
cat scans done I went home after that I
went on the Internet wrong thing to do
right if you want good news man you do
not go on the internet googled the
American Cancer Society colon cancer
stage one two three
Stage four had a five-year survival rate
at that time of six percent I closed
down the computer and I said you know
what that&#39;s not me there&#39;s no way that&#39;s
me that night I got the phone call and
it was the doctor and he said Terry it&#39;s
gone from your your colon to your liver
to golf ball-sized tumors right away I
thought oh this is it I&#39;m dead I mean
maybe months I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m lucky
maybe more than that and right then I
had this vision of my daughter who you
saw in the video and it was her wedding
day and there she was standing in this
room and there was this full-length
mirror in front of her and my two
sisters were standing there next to her
and they looked at Katie and they said
Katie if your mother was here today she
would tell you how proud she is of you
she would tell you that you&#39;re beautiful
inside and out she would tell you that
one day you are gonna be a fantastic mom
two days later I thought you know what
we better go to church I&#39;m gonna get
everything in order here right so my
husband and I and the rest of the family
we go to church my daughter and my son
and that day they told the message
actually was a story they told a story
and it was about two individuals a woman
named Maria and a marine and they were
gonna go run an ultramarathon an
ultramarathon can be different distances
this particular one a hundred and thirty
five miles they have 45 hours to
complete it so you can have a team of
people that are there to support you
during this race they drive a van they
do your nutrition you can jump in and
rest maybe a massage therapist or PT or
you know physical therapy whatever you
need to finish this race well the day of
the race comes Maria had one person one
individual to help her the marine he had
all the Marines in his troop in his unit
they said you know what man we will
train with you we will drive your van we
will do everything we can to get you
from the start to the finish they take
off the Marine gets to like mile 56 he&#39;s
done he needs IV fluids he&#39;s
disqualified
here comes our girl power right Maria
now she&#39;s at like mile 80 and those
Marines they hear that she just has one
one person there to help her so they go
up they get in their van and they catch
up with her she has blisters all over
the bottom of her feet she has no
toenails left she&#39;s wearing Tevas and
literally two Marines on each side of
her bend down they lift her up they
stand her up they formed this half
circle around her and somehow some way
without physically advancing her she
gets to the finish line breaks the tape
first thing she did was look at those
Marines and she said you know what I
couldn&#39;t have done it without each of
you I couldn&#39;t have done it without all
of you
that night 72 hours into this diagnosis
I woke up well I don&#39;t even know if I
ever got to sleep but I just remember I
felt was so full of fear and my insides
just it was like a snow globe on
steroids and all of a sudden I had this
kind of Epiphany I thought what if I
built an army what if I asked for help
you know I thought I was really pretty
much a bad ass right up to this point so
that&#39;s what I did I put out the call to
action I asked that next morning I put
out this call in who wants to join my
army my best friend said she&#39;d be a
sniper she&#39;d go out there she take any
bullet for me seriously
lots of sniper snipers are good foot
soldiers mess hall people prayer
warriors fact I was reminded the other
day those prayer warriors are still
working really hard on overtime how
blessed am I so that&#39;s what I did I
formed this army I never gave up that
dream of going to Hawaii of doing that
Ironman and so in the middle of the
night in 2011 this was after I went
through two years of heavy chemo and
surgeries and radiation and all this
been placed on maintenance chemo I
decided to sit down and write this email
to Ironman and ask hey maybe I couldn&#39;t
maybe I could get one of those spots
maybe I could be a featured athlete type
up this email you know dear Ironman and
I got to tell you I played the cancer
card right how many do we have 52 cancer
cards right it&#39;s how I played one right
there I said look I have stage 4 colon
cancer five-year survival rate of 6
percent I have three things on my bucket
list I challenge all of you if you
hadn&#39;t thought about your bucket list
please do amazing number one I said I
want to live long enough to celebrate 25
years of marriage I think we&#39;re on 30
[Laughter]
I said I want to live long enough to see
my son and my daughter get married my
dream nutters and I&#39;d love to
participate in the 2000 World
Championship Ironman so I turned 50 next
month we make my dreams come true you
know I got an email back the next
morning I always say it was better than
winning the lottery my husband said you
wish you would have had the money so
three months later I take off to Kona 35
members of my army
Terry&#39;s troops my friends my family my
doctors went with me and what you
witnessed was a dream coming true
crossing that finish line and hopefully
what you felt was the accomplishment of
truly a big dream a big bold dream
coming true
hope h ope hope the acronym that I use
is how ordinary people endure a lot of
people will say what I did was
extraordinary or though tell me Terry
you are extraordinary what you&#39;re doing
is extraordinary and let me tell you
I&#39;ve been called a lot of things in my
life hadn&#39;t usually not very kind things
but extraordinary was never one of them
so I decided to look up what
extraordinary meant and it&#39;s actually
ordinary with the word extra in front of
it and so I thought you know what I can
be ordinary with the extra in front of
it in fact everyone in this room can be
extraordinary
as I was in the middle of treatment I
would do other races and I decided to
run a half marathon in st. Louis and I
would when I had the heavy chemo I would
come home at the time
now the pumps are much smaller but at
the time I had a huge pop I would come
home with this chemo running in me for
48 hours I have a port right here and
one of the things I felt comfortable
doing was
going to the grocery store so I got to
know the store manager there and he was
a guy in I don&#39;t know probably is his
early 40s he also was trained for the
same half-ironman as me I was in st. Joe
st. Louis in April and this particular
year it was pretty warm the weekend of
the event so two weeks after the the
race I&#39;m in the frozen food section and
there comes the manager and he&#39;s like
hey how&#39;d your race go Terry and I&#39;m
like you know what it was fantastic I
mean I I try and live in this attitude
of gratitude so when I get to this
finish line it&#39;s a it&#39;s 90% and when I
run the race I&#39;m I&#39;m just thrilled to be
there and when I finish whoa that&#39;s a
bonus right so I look at him and I say
well how did you race go oh it was so
hot that day like yeah I know it was hot
cuz no no it was really hot I&#39;m thinking
yeah whatever because I had this time I
wanted to make and that my nutrition was
off and so I got to mile nine and I quit
and I go you quit so now he felt about
this big right so he goes on his way and
I go on mine and I&#39;m in the checkout
lane and I feel this tap on my shoulder
and I turn around in there he is he&#39;s
offering me a gooey butter cake
hahaha which I take cuz I just love
sweets and I think it was his penance
you know he&#39;s asking for forgiveness or
whatever cuz he didn&#39;t finish the race
but he looked at me and he said um I
want to tell you one thing I am never
ever gonna quit again I&#39;m never gonna
quit again
and as I left I thought to myself we all
have a mile nine in her life or maybe
many my own Ines and it&#39;s what are you
gonna do when you hit your mile nine
what&#39;s your game plan what do you have
in place or your friends gonna be there
your family your faith there was a woman
named Diana Nyad anybody familiar with
her the endurance
Swimmer yeah another girl power so she
wanted to swim from Cuba to Key West 110
miles it took her 70 hours she attempted
the first time in her early 20s never
gave up that dream and her 60s she
attempted it I think four or five more
times the last attempt she succeeded can
you imagine she coming up out of that
water on the beach can you imagine I
mean what her legs must have felt like
people were trying to help her support
her she pushed him away pushed him away
pushed him away she wanted the world to
know three things she held up three
fingers remember how swollen her face
was from the jellyfish yeah three things
she said number one you&#39;re never too old
and I like to say you&#39;re never too young
to accomplish your dreams number two
never alone you can&#39;t do it alone
she had a whole team working for her I
had my army I had my faith and number
three never ever ever give up never give
up I really believe that in order to
keep something you have to give it away
so today I want to give you my hope the
Ironman motto is anything is possible
the Terry Greek mantra is powered by
hope so if you leave here with one
message today from me it would be
anything is possible
powered by hope thank you
