good morning everybody today I&#39;d like to
start with a simple exercise for a
second there
imagine yourself five years into the
future it&#39;s a pleasant November morning
it&#39;s a Saturday but it&#39;s 2022
what does 2022 look like for you where
do you stay
what work do you do would you stab it
you know when I ask others this question
then the answers I get are mostly very
inspiring I hear things like I would be
study in one of the best universities in
the world at that time I would have
definitely written a book by then I
would like to start up my own company by
then you see how all these answers all
these statements talk about a future
that&#39;s an improvement from the present
it&#39;s a step change it&#39;s for a better
future right nobody really says in five
years I&#39;m gonna be penniless and broke
right so here&#39;s the catch when asked
when we are able to dream of a future
that is so much bigger and better and
brighter than a present why is it that
we are so scared to make that future a
goal and work towards it my name is
Kaushik Mukherjee I&#39;m an entrepreneur a
triathlete but before all of that I&#39;m a
pretty typical product of an average
middle-class family and today here on
the TEDx platform I have a confession to
make gold scare the hell out of me and
there&#39;s a reason for that
what if I fail I used to ask this
question to myself for many many years
till one day it just stopped making
sense I asked myself look you born in a
country where you&#39;re by default
competing with a billion other people
for everything from traffic on the
streets to even a seat in an auditorium
like this so when exactly did fear of
failure creep in this is not something
which we are born with this is called
social conditioning we&#39;ve learnt to be
fearful of failure and because we have
learned to be fearful of failure we are
always trying to set goals that we are
easily most likely to achieve and that
got me thinking the first time I
realized that was when I
25 I was working I had a pretty
predictable trajectory in my career
schooling followed by engineering
followed by any guesses management no
that was far away an IT job so so I was
pretty much a very very predictable and
then one day if you were to ask me how
did a typical day at office look like it
was very simple this this was my first
job playing a lot of table tennis having
a lot of free coffee and basically being
the king of my comfort zone I was
killing it at my first job and then one
day during a presentation with the
senior management so we were just
setting up the projector and I was there
my manager was there my managers
managers was there her director was
there and suddenly in one view I could
just see my entire life in front of me I
could see who I would be when I&#39;d be 30
35 45 and it was a very very sobering
thought that&#39;s when I decided that
something had to change
I&#39;d have to do something to bring about
a quantum leap in my life I decided to
set a goal that would terrify me so I
started by saying okay let me first look
back and see what are the goals I&#39;ve
actually set in my life in the past and
in typical geek nerdy fashion
I tried plotting them on a graph I said
okay let&#39;s divide goals and take simple
goals
let&#39;s take difficult goals let tech
goals let&#39;s take goals where I&#39;m likely
to succeed and goals where I&#39;m most
likely to fail and the thing that
shocked me the most from this exercise
was that almost all my goals that had
set till date were in one quadrant the
safe quadrant I mean that was that was
quite a turning point in my life I asked
myself how am I ever gonna grow do
amazing things in life if I continue
year after year after year to set goals
in my safe space and I said okay this
will not do
I needed a goal that&#39;s gonna be bigger
than anything I&#39;ve done before this was
about 12 years back when MBA degrees
were being peddled as the fastest ticket
to a super fabulous life and I decided
okay I&#39;m gonna get I&#39;m gonna earn an
admission into one of the best business
schools in the country I&#39;m gonna appear
for the
CIT exam and I wanted a seat at IMM at
the bar there was only one problem with
that
two and a half lakh applicants 250 seats
0.1% I could not get about that number
and of course the fact that I finished
in the bottom half of my class and
engineering didn&#39;t help but then I
thought look I have nothing to lose
nobody expects me to get in anyway so
let&#39;s fight like I have nothing to lose
and I started preparing I started taking
tests I started taking practice tests
attending classes and as the day&#39;s kept
you know get kept getting closer to the
date of the exam I I knew that there
were a lot of people I was competing
with who was smarter than me who were
much more intelligent than me but I
thought okay let me work harder than
them and try to level the playing field
so I started psyching myself as the date
of the exam started coming closer I used
to do some pretty crazy things I used to
while taking practice tests I used to
change the time on my watch to 10 o
clock because I wanted to get
acclimatized to how my watch would look
during the actual time of the exam
because ten o clock was when the exam
started I took an exam in the same dress
I would wear on the final day I took an
exam with TV blaring in the next room
just in case there was a wedding
reception next to the on the day of the
exam while while commuting from my home
to office I used to bike that time and I
developed this habit of seeing the car
in front of me I used to take the number
plate the four digits in the number
plate split them down the middle and try
to multiply the left two numbers by the
right two numbers just to get better at
mental math you know now that I think
about it this is like some serious crazy
thing but in 2006 when the results came
out and I got a call from every single
one of the top business schools in the
country I knew that something inside me
had changed I was not scared to set
goals beyond the bottom left quadrant
anymore set a goal where you are likely
to fail because nobody anyways expects
you to achieve it and without the burden
or expectations you have no idea how
much you can achieve idn&#39;t 2008 there&#39;s
a bit of daredevil D that creeps in in
the final year of every education course
right
the finally or you stop attending
classes you start hanging out more with
friends you plan to conquer the world
and I did that I was four months away
from graduating from I am Emma the BOD
with one of the highest paying jobs in
campus it was an investment banking job
in New York my batch mate who actually
took up the offer went on to net one
crore in salary it still pinches and and
and I was taking part in a few B plan
contests and case studies and I suddenly
thought that you know what I can do this
I should start a company of my own and I
was torn there was a part of me which
said you know the typical things people
say get some experience get some money
you know better place see if and there
was a part of me said no you know now is
the time and I should do it so here&#39;s
the thing at 26 single without
liabilities I was just too young to
trade comfort for passion so I decided
to start up something about I started I
started a an online e-commerce site I
know I look very funny that I know so
yeah but that&#39;s me so we started an
online e-commerce portal and when we
started it was interesting there was a
lot of press coverage people said
congratulations although I really don&#39;t
know what they were congratulating me
for because I had built nothing but
anyways as time passed after six months
the press coverage reduced the the I
mean we got down to work and then we
realize that things weren&#39;t working out
and no investor would even touch our
business model with the 10-foot Pole so
I changed the business model I said okay
instead of an e-commerce portal let&#39;s
make it a bargaining portal did not work
okay let&#39;s make a bargaining algorithm
and give it to other people did not work
okay let&#39;s try recommending price
let&#39;s try tweaking the engine so it
could recommend insurance premiums what
does the any guesses what happened you
know the answer to this of course it did
not work so at the end of it I realize
that you know it&#39;s not working out let
me just go back and get back to a job
and in those two years I realized
something that you know there never is a
best time there&#39;s only now and there&#39;s
later
and the choice is yours when you want to
start because if somebody told me today
that look for the first two years given
my skills given everything I am for the
first two years you are going to be
doing things that you&#39;re going to be
failing at you are going to be doing
things which will not work out
I would plate exactly the same way I
would rather have make my mistakes
learned from my failures when I was 26
then later and that&#39;s what I did
I knew that my first shot at shaping the
now didn&#39;t work out but I also knew that
next time I would start I would start
from a much stronger place and well that
place came pretty soon this was 2012 and
I had finished I was I&#39;d finished two
years in my organization at that time
and it&#39;s interesting how we read a lot
about how you&#39;re supposed to focus on
the goal in hand but what&#39;s also
interesting is that nobody really tells
us what not to focus on I&#39;m gonna ask
you to humor me a bit so does anybody
have a doesn&#39;t have a pen or pencil in
their pockets anything anything at all
okay if you do if you do let me see if I
have one yeah I have one
okay so just just hold it up right here
right now when you hold up something
like this right imagine this and if you
don&#39;t have a pen a pen a pencil you can
just use your fingers well now imagine
the tip the tip of the pencil as your
goal right you have now defined the goal
and now start slowly moving towards the
pencil start moving towards your goal
you see what&#39;s happening here you know
what&#39;s happening here right now you are
blurring in the background I can&#39;t see
you anymore because I&#39;m focused on the
goal why are you blurring because
compared to my goal you are not
important compared to the goal the
background is not important if you
change your focus from the goal to the
background you&#39;re not focusing on the
goal anymore you know what the
background is Bajorans people telling
you that you know this is not a good
time why don&#39;t you get some excess why
don&#39;t you get some experience and do
that later there&#39;s another thing that&#39;s
happening what&#39;s happening I look
ridiculous so sometimes when you are
chasing goals you end up looking
ridiculous you end up doing really funny
things people laugh let them laugh it&#39;s
not their goal anyways it&#39;s your goal
and it&#39;s up to you to maintain focus on
the goal
and let some fires burn in the
background when I decided to start up
for the second time my well wishers gave
me a really hard time there were things
like you just got married why don&#39;t you
start a family look at what everybody
else is doing there were others who said
your batch mates not just the batch mate
who made a lot of money every batch mate
they were buying houses they were buying
fancy cars and they&#39;re like look at them
don&#39;t you feel like you should also do
the same thing what happens if you fail
again your career record recovered from
one but yo Korea is not gonna recover
for the from a second debacle but my
heart was set and I said okay I owe it
to myself to try again and I did
fast-forward five years and luckily the
well-wishes aren&#39;t so upset with me
anymore in spite of a journey of ups and
downs I&#39;m grateful to share that today I
run a five-year-old venture-backed
company with multi-million dollar
revenues and last year for the first
time we turned profitable so it&#39;s
sometimes you got to listen to the voice
inside you it says let&#39;s just ignore all
the voice in the background for a while
and just focus on the tip of the pencil
you may look ridiculous but it&#39;s your
best shot of getting there now this is
the story that&#39;s closest to my heart
it&#39;s also what&#39;s most recent in 2011 I
married the love of my life in 2011 my
wife married the second love of her life
because her first love was is and will
always be running she she runs his half
marathon ultramarathon insane and for
many many years I I cured her from the
stands actually mostly the couch I but I
chaired and in 2015 we were blessed with
a little baby and that&#39;s when it was
wonderful life was beautiful exciting
and beyond all the social media pictures
we were drowning we were drowning in a
sea of expectations responsibilities and
diapers a lot of diapers you don&#39;t know
I&#39;m not going there so and given the
kind of individuals we were we started
asking ourselves is this it has life
changed are we are we done we&#39;re not
gonna set goals
anymore and in one of those moments of
introspection I remember asking my wife
at that time hey do you want to sign up
for a run sometime you know it
de-stresses you he said yeah that&#39;s not
a good idea I should do that he said
okay and there&#39;s a full marathon coming
up the Mumbai marathon do you want to
sign up for that as well like yeah why
thank you
sounds great why didn&#39;t you sign up for
an ironman instead have you lost it I&#39;ll
explain the Ironman Triathlon is largely
known as the toughest single day
endurance event in the world Alex Flinn
the event comprises of a 3.8 kilometer
swim for that is not a typo I thought it
was the type of the first time I saw
that hunt followed by a 180 kilometres
bike ride followed by a full marathon of
42 kilometers and you have to complete
this all together back to back within a
span of 17 hours and the whole idea
seems so out of the box so we didn&#39;t
talk about it for a long while but we
also couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it
and one day in 2015 I created a folder
on my on the e Drive of my laptop I said
Ironman 2017 and I did some research and
I listed all the races between that time
2015 till 2017 and made folders of it
and slowly slowly we started signing up
for these races we started really small
and did a triathlon which was quarter
the distance of a full Ironman we just
wanted to see if we could swim we could
cycle we could run and not end up in the
nearest hospital so on the final day of
the race we we by the end of it we were
dehydrated we were burnt
we were we were given pain but we were
also very very stoked really okay we did
this and we really wanted to see how far
we could push it because this seemed
like a ticket and escape from where we
were at that moment so we started
planning and we were the usual suspects
any triathlon in India we would just
show up there we just showed up there
and slowly the distances started
increasing from quarter to half ironman
distances from half ironman distances to
3/4 ironman distances and we faced
everything you could imagine there was a
ohh
Waters Lake swimwear in I felt dizzy and
I was out of breath so I had to hold on
to one of the rescue kayaks there was a
race where there was an SUV coming from
the other side and it collided with my
wife&#39;s bike and shared a fall there was
so many run when there was lactic acid
buildup in my muscles and I was just too
cramped to run so I had to walk more
than 25 kilometers just to reach the
finish line but on July 2nd 2017 earlier
this year when we were at the start line
of the race at Austria with thousands of
other athletes we were nervous but we
weren&#39;t scared if we had done everything
in our power to get to that point and
when the race cannon fired and we drove
headfirst into the water we knew what we
were set for we fought the hardest we
have ever physically fought in our lives
we fought against complacency we fought
against people telling us that your life
has changed but we had to reach the
finish line and after 16 hours of
extreme pain and fatigue when we finally
reached the finish line it was glorious
this thank you it this was not an
endeavour for our title of being called
an Ironman triathlete or a medal
although it&#39;s a pretty good looking
medal but this was more to tell
ourselves that if we plan and just take
small wins at a time how far could we go
just just a couple of big stars I there
was a friend of mine who was visiting
and he said okay you know I&#39;ve seen the
middle can I have a look at the middle
and I&#39;m gonna move off the light for a
bit and then I said okay here here is
what the medal looks like and and my
friend said wow this man looks really
awesome and that&#39;s when it that is
struck me and I told him you know what
this man might look awesome but this
medal didn&#39;t make me you want to see
what make me you want to see what makes
made me who I am and made this medal
possible then you want to look at the
fold over there and then you have to
look at all that the folder got me this
because the world might look at this but
I know that without this this would have
never happened so in closing I&#39;d just
like to say that in life whatever we go
through is typically what we what we
grow through I was I was a person who
used to be very used to get a panic
attack whenever I had to come on stage
to speak and about three months back I
set a terrifying goal for myself
to come and ask all of you to start
setting terrifying goals see how life
changes
I&#39;m sure five five months or six months
back when PSID decided that okay you
know what we should have a TEDx talk
that was a goal right
a terrifying will and look at what&#39;s
happening right now we are here I am
speaking and this is happening it&#39;s
getting recorded tomorrow millions of
people are gonna watch it it&#39;s amazing
right so I just like to end I say that
there&#39;s no point in thinking about what
happens if you fail nothing is
irreversible except death no chance is
the last chance until you decide to
fatigue fall down seven stand up eight
our goals are for us to chase thank you
very much psi T this has been very
special thank you thank you
[Applause]
you
