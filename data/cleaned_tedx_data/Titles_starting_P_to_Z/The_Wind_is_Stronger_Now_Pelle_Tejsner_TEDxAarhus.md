the wind is stronger now our ice is
thinner the weather is getting warmer
we&#39;ve all seen the images associated
with climate change the melting glaciers
the statistical tipping points the
floods the surges so how come we&#39;re not
compelled or pushed move to do more to
tackle that one single perhaps greatest
challenge of our time
as an anthropologist I would suggest
it&#39;s because we are missing the human
face of climate change you see all the
all the technology all our satellite
imagery the high-resolution telemetry
images all this is so recent when it
comes to our history on this planet you
see for the better part of humanity&#39;s
story of adapting to our world we have
passed on our experiences by actually
telling each other stories so let me
tell you a couple of stories about the
human face of climate change our story
is set in the Arctic and the reason for
that is of course because we know that
the Arctic is considered the canary in
humanity&#39;s coal mine the changes that
are coming and are happening will be
first and foremost felt in the Arctic
and so this is a story about a very
unique group of people that I had the
extreme privilege of working alongside
for the better part of a year and it&#39;s a
story about their relationship to the
environment so I lived in this place
called covetous Rock it basically means
the Big Island all right
so it&#39;s on the west coast of Greenland
and you see like everything else in the
Arctic it&#39;s big
in fact Greenland is so big that if you
were to stand in chula and had to travel
far far to the southern part of
Greenland it&#39;s a distance somewhere
between Rome and Johannesburg massive
you see for millennia the Inuit have
perfected or mastered the art of safely
navigating in one of our planet&#39;s most
hostile inhospitable rapidly changing
environments in fact they have geared
their entire way of life and their
culture to this place so I suspect they
might have a story and a lesson for us
to learn when it comes to dealing with
climate change the Inuit have a name for
the ice they call it sicko in fact it
has more than a name because they
believed it to be endowed with a kind of
spirit an entity that has intention and
they call that
Saku ánewá and they are always quick
to make the association with another
great entity that they call sila it&#39;s
the sky spirit the weather personified
in the wind so the Inuit know that
there&#39;s always a connection between the
condition of the ice and the moods of
and they can make that connection they
learn that very very early on in life
how different wind conditions are
associated to the ice they can travel
the ice and read it reading the weather
this is the Alpha and Omega to finding
the food and thereby the life creating a
life in the Arctic environment one of
the one of the earliest stories that I
heard when I was traveling out one day
with a good friend of mine is one that
he told me that you know the wind is
stronger now and this of course affects
the conditions of the ice because when
the ice tries to form we need quiet
winds but when winds are blowing
stronger and stronger and fiercer and
fiercer it continues to break our rise
the wind is stronger now there is
another story that I would like to tell
you not so much the wind being stronger
but while out traveling one day with a
hunting friend you know he tells me the
ice back in the day used to be so much
thicker we used to have to cut stairs in
that ice to get to the water where the
life and the animals are our food
nowadays we just poke it once or twice
and we&#39;re at the water so if we listen
to the stories of the old hunters they
tell us that you know back in the good
old days they always talk about the old
days see you know the sea ice would
would come in late December and stay
around until summer maybe five or six
months nowadays
it might only last a couple of months
one or two months maybe a couple of
weeks one or two days but you know
despite this loss of that natural
phenomenon upon which they have built
their entire existence the internet
whether with a kind of usual pragmatic
optimism will always tell me that we&#39;ve
always lived here and will continue to
live here late at night when you&#39;ve been
listening to those many stories about
traveling out in the ice
you always often hear them end on the
saying that Selah is our master
in other words nature carries on
regardless all we can do is to try and
keep up and it is in in that trying to
keep up that the Inuit are simply doing
what they have always done which is to
maintain you could say this is the
crudeness of English language but a
dialogue with our surroundings with our
environment understanding the conditions
the connection between the weather and
the ice to finally find out where those
animals are early one morning in the
depth of the Arctic winter I&#39;m out
crossing the ice trying to keep up with
a good friend of mine as we&#39;re walking
out and see ku is dead calm and sila is
smiling from a sky above
when suddenly my hunting companions
turns around to me and says you know
when I hear that sound of my own
footsteps
as I walk across the ice it truly
reminds me of Who I am
what&#39;s the moral of these stories I
think when it comes to adaptation on the
planet our own survival it&#39;s about
taking a view not off the world like
that big satellite out in space looking
down but within it part and parcel to
begin with through our experiences
dialogue and the stories that we pass on
my last story tonight is it&#39;s actually
not from the Arctic but it does have to
do with ice and it comes from a
colleague of mine works in the Andes and
he&#39;s telling me a story about how
there&#39;s an indigenous group of people in
the Andes now who are mourning the loss
of their God
you see they believe their God a nearby
glacier to be their God but that now
because of global warming this God is
dying melting away very very quickly but
you know instead of mourning these
people have started to take ice from
nearby glaciers new ones to carry them
on these mountain roads to their dying
God placing them at the foot of it to
read rekindle his life so what&#39;s left
well maybe you can tell me
did you hear the stories listen yeah do
you have a dialogue with your
environment and finally how much ice
would you be willing to carry thank you
[Applause]
