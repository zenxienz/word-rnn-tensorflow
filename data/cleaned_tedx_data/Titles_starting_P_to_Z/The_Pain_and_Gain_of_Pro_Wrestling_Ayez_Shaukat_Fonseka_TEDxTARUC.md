hello ladies and gentlemen what I would
think that how you see for fighting
before you started to be all right so
first of all allow me to introduce
myself to you for those of you who do
not know me my name is Aisha Fonseca
like a copy is and I am the founder of
militia wrestling and one of the
pioneers of professional wrestling and
Southeast Asia the microphone don&#39;t
stick the lightning is very severe
buzzes all right so I&#39;m just going to do
a little bit of short pants here how
many of you here have watched from a
national fight a lot I suppose those of
you who did not reach em why not why not
because I&#39;m going to bring two of my
residents here today it&#39;s all about so
without whether you allow me to
introduce
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and introducing from getting Islands Bob
way minutes uh by PNC problem by BW
extreme vision champion
[Applause]
[Applause]
all right so these guys are gonna beat
each other up
do you guys can share you guys can move
for whatever it is you guys seem to
enjoy this match but before we start a
match needs a referee so our line
can I have around me up here please
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
leave this microphone to the gas company
there you guys ready
let&#39;s think this thing hello everyone
good afternoon my name is Z and I feel
your poverty the for this afternoon
those who&#39;s hitting the fan good luck on
your left is double K and on my right is
be very very intimidating Gotham who is
no.1 smash ah he is no one&#39;s green tea
Oh Oh ed not traditionally head-knocking
thrown wrestling oh I&#39;m a la M Ella very
traditional as well
we start things off with a bit
generously to see who has the more
dominant wrestling and abilities okay so
start with what is honestly you guys
professionalizing is a unique art form
yes it&#39;s an art form which combines
athletics and performance and the edges
alright so that is generally what we do
with professional wrestling is we want
to take you on an emotional
rollercoaster ride so when you watch
this match even if you&#39;re a fan of
professional wrestling or not I don&#39;t
listen each and every single one of you
were smiling you were cheering for
wherever you wanted to be in your
viewing the bad guy and this
this shows that within them they are
fight there was a story inside and
that&#39;s all he helps to bring you in on
an emotional rollercoaster ride
so that is what professional wrestling
is about all right so sorry I&#39;m a bit
old school I like to use my coupon
I saw people might ask me why
professional wrestling I&#39;ve seen why not
growing up I&#39;ve always wanted to become
a professional wrestler I&#39;m not kidding
you I&#39;m not kidding you ever since in
primary school a chick will use ass is
United Yahoo a philosophic juice I have
a caddy protester the whole class laugh
at me take him but I know why don&#39;t you
want to be a bore a Smith because I see
the guys on TV fighting very cool and
then armored event is for opening up
same thing one by one you gotta be she
needs a doctor jiggle you can final
spectacles you take you can put the
metal jingles you
[Applause]
[Applause]
I&#39;ve always been laughed at so being
loved them being ridiculed is my main
fuel to try something new I mean there&#39;s
no platform in Malaysia there&#39;s nobody
doing it so why can I start it let me
create a platform because if you don&#39;t
start something it&#39;s not gonna happen
we&#39;re gonna whip or something it&#39;s
nothing happens you just have to go for
it and just hopefully it goes for the
best and it proves to be the best now
because I have a lot of media stations
now fighting over the rights of my VW I
have 13 different countries when
contacted me wanting rights to show my
VW in the country so they are not
showing that if you dare to do something
different it might just work out very
well for you all right so I want you
guys to keep that in mind if they ever
take you fishing please do so okay so
that&#39;s some popularizing again and after
the one division that works out so
professional actually when I mentioned
and plantings and practice in
professional wrestling what do I mean
these guys you see the one fighting
yourself they train like actual athletes
they can do a lot of physical stuff that
image so for example can I have a wife
or three girl outside here please
but this guy is one of the most agile
person a very big this big he is about
110 kilos you can jump this high thank
you I&#39;m gonna do push-ups without the
teasing 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25
alright I have the neighbors are just
taking my time
[Applause]
and easily without the guy to charge and
the average guy with average fitness and
relays and temperature so that speaks a
lot about a level of athleticism ability
that these wrestlers have see that
training is crazy a very trained five
times a week
these wrestlers are trained five times a
week to be superior athletes they need
to be agile they need to be fast and to
be strong and above all that they must
be able to have the charisma the
showmanship to keep you guys interested
in dimensions like what there&#39;s a
benefit so now we are going to do
theatrics aspect off professional like I
mentioned earlier professionally the
matches are an emotional rollercoaster
for you guys first we chill but it could
die and they were the bad guys start
beating up on a good guy you just feel
sorry but if you can and it&#39;s not going
the bad guys then suddenly like Superman
the good guys have this power back in
such difficulty I even enjoyed it we got
to get all excited self and then I start
rolling for recording you know what will
come up so please it takes an eye a lot
deeper the professionally but they are
not professional wrestling has is for
psychology it&#39;s called ring psychology
then check there is a non professional
in psychology is this thing
restless need to know how to evoke
emotion is out of the audience when we
do make improve for them waiting to
maybe cheer for them how to make you sad
how to make you happy
after many fields are suspenseful we
need to learn all of this aspect in
order to be a good performer
it&#39;s very so the advice I&#39;ve spoken
about the basics of professional
wrestling
I want it be the secrets of pro
wrestling this is the most
secrets of currently okay so the most
common question that people want to pass
by there are free class all right all
right so what I can say this to call
wrestling a professional is fake is
unfair we can fake pain yes on camera
but when it&#39;s a light performance you
try to think be in the audience and tell
that you&#39;re not gonna be the guy for you
and if you don&#39;t believe what is going
on at the states what is happening you
guys and not get connected to the match
which is amazing why when you saw the
matching bottom and double key they were
both hitting each other with full horse
you can hear the sound like yes
depends these professionals are trained
to absorb as much damage as possible
they are trained to be immune to pain
decision while you can throw their body
on down there or here they can get sled
and kick in here and everything that is
our training we train our body to block
out the pain and absorb it and Z is yes
he&#39;s just returning with us most
expensive very new and it&#39;s very good
that it was obvious so actually guys are
visual proof you cannot big thing
all right so the next question I usually
get is that this wrestling photograph to
be honest no it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
photographic everything you see in a
match happens spontaneously
these two wrestlers are talking to each
other as they are wrestling without you
guys missing he&#39;s telling him what to do
next
he said him what&#39;s his point is going to
be dance well you guys did not catch
that thank you
right and it&#39;s not pornographic we can
ask our organizers here there are colors
for yourselves right one is cheap money
and stop that it&#39;s just that being a
professional sorry I used to talk
spontaneously we are used to do things
continiously inspected every because -
rehearsal it senses that you might screw
up so everything is spontaneously it is
an amazing at home this guy needs to
live how to receive and give technique
this game is 11 receive and give pending
so they don&#39;t leave it on HTTP each
other but it&#39;s very very very convincing
when you guys believe that they are you
think so next question
they&#39;re usually get is how do you decide
the winner
if wrestling is fake alright so
wrestling is not big once again it&#39;s
very disrespectful Percy you say darling
speak because number one it says per
year
I&#39;m a full-time photographer - Hong Kong
Singapore Indonesia I&#39;ve been offered
[Applause]
but one can take spoken wrestling is
predetermined
yes the witness I decided like for
example double K and bathroom I told
that he doesn&#39;t have a Mexican offer
that next time you see they asked me so
it&#39;s gonna be good let it set upon
yourself then you spoke about myself
hey you winner so everything that
anything was pertinent it&#39;s where the
winner is
we need the mean why is because question
I think once again it&#39;s a mix of
athletics and performing arts it is
exactly like a ballet recital but with
lots and lots of violence
it is exactly like an official lots and
lots of high things this is that so we
do not even market ourselves as real
fighters going on to real files
everybody now knows Africa translates
pretty demeaning but what we do is we
suspend your belief we suspending the
globally if we make you believe for a
second that what we&#39;re doing here is
real the exact same thing that Hollywood
movies why I&#39;m a visa militia bottom
double whatever move the movies are
doing it suspend your belief I mean for
a second when you watch spider-man
homecoming how can you believe there&#39;s
this guy and climb walls and start
slinging on webs and everything because
it&#39;s especially that&#39;s the exact same
thing that professionals you do suspend
your belief our game is not will not
produce the profession are saying there
is no ego whatever knowing or our main
aim is to entertain you and to make new
church to make you who even the worst
thing of the carbon operational is when
you top top there when people are
talking is from what I&#39;m doing on when
you&#39;re Esther and Esther and Esther then
nobody that&#39;s the reaction nobody pays
attention that&#39;s the worst thing that
can happen to us well so what you need
to do is resonates you need to end up in
the crowd you can make that change to
make them who the good guy you want to
cheer for you but a bad guy you want
them to do for you
so then is what potentially it&#39;s all
about all right just to close up on this
note because I&#39;m but I believe that our
profession residence
information rising that&#39;s not get the
respect of Betty deserves love people
think that is big so if you want to call
this thing then what would you call
those action stars in movies where I
should use stunt doubles and camera
tricks to bake their action look more
convincing on screen whereas we were
interested as we perform in life in
front of our eyes we put our body online
for our life online there&#39;s trust me
there&#39;s been thousands of profession
who have died of got paralyzed during a
swing so we put our body on line we put
our necks on the line and for me but
father speak is very very said we are
take when all the action started you see
on stage instead of say that an equality
opens up your mind and also hope that in
a way I despite you guys be able to
pursue your dreams and never ever ever
be afraid to do things
thank you so much
[Applause]
