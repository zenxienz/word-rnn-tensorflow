[Music]
thank you so very much for letting me
share this time your precious time and
be here with you I want to start by
asking you a question
and that question is this have you ever
seriously thought about how precious
little time we have on earth but
everybody in this room has right put a
sobering question right I mean think
about it if if we&#39;re lucky we only have
several decades of life on a planet
that&#39;s been here for billions of years
life for millions of years and if you&#39;re
like me over half of my sand is passed
through the neck abag hourglass
that&#39;s just so profound if you stop and
carefully consider that and yet the
curious thing is that people they don&#39;t
live their life that way they live as
though they have forever they&#39;re caught
up in the past in the future they&#39;re
never really in the neck of the
hourglass all that much I find that just
absolutely curious and so I&#39;m hoping for
the time that we have together we&#39;re
really gonna be focused with one another
for just a short period of time so I&#39;m
going to tell you about a time in my
life when I was 20 years old and I had
just come back from seeing my father he
was a park ranger out in California and
I had shipped my motorcycle back to
Texas I picked it up I topped it off
with gas I met up with my girlfriend and
we were gonna go see young guns to I
don&#39;t know if you ever saw
young guns to our young guns maybe with
emilio estevez oh oh my god great
western if you like westerns i never did
make it to young guns too but i was
sitting there and we were about to go
and i had this this incredible
overwhelming sensation that I only had
once in my life I&#39;ve never had it again
but it was this awful sick feeling like
you should not get on this motorcycle I
cannot describe it in words but I
ignored it see I had no data you know I
had no information right to suggest
otherwise so we got on the bike and we
got out on Skillman we were almost to
the theater and over in the right in a
parking lot there was a guy in a car and
he was either gonna go back the opposite
direction of us and where he was gonna
get out on the same street that we were
riding on and I was riding you know we
were doing the speed limit at 45 miles
an hour and so I counted one second two
second three second he&#39;s still right and
I&#39;d gotten off the throttle so I&#39;d
probably got no no maybe forty miles an
hour right so he sees me back on the
throttle right as I get back on the
throttle he moves he hasn&#39;t seen me and
you want to talk about the neck of an
hourglass what one grain of sand means
he pulls out at the most you might argue
the most inopportune time and I got one
second to react one second now those
that know me well will know that I can&#39;t
even chew gum at the same time I&#39;m
actually doing something but I would
later in the hospital I would look at
and write a list I mean you know what
are you gonna do to keep your mind off
the pain and everything I just write a
list of all the conscious thoughts that
went through my mind in that brief
second it was incredible all this stuff
am I gonna die am I gonna kill the
girlfriend on the back how am I gonna
get to my next semester I&#39;m supposed to
be there in two days am I ever gonna see
my father again how am I gonna pay for
this are they gonna think it&#39;s my fault
I&#39;m not speeding he pulled out in front
of me
but there was one thought that I can
remember distinctly that just came out
in my mind more than any other you know
what it was oh shit
but the most hilarious part about it I
remember thinking how funny this was you
think of funny in just a brief second
but literally I remember thinking how
funny was that I&#39;m thinking oh shit
while my girlfriend is looking over my
shoulder yelling oh shit loud enough for
me to hear it you know when I was at
elements on that is just extraordinary
right and then in the most incredible
fashion BAM we hit the front quarter
panel of this car and oh my god at 45
miles an hour coming to a dead stop and
metal hitting metal like that is
excruciating it&#39;s haunting and at four
for over 1/2 mile I can still feel it
today but it&#39;s very subdued but at the
time for years that awful crunch would
haunt me and and and what was amazing
though what was miraculous
was my girlfriend would be thrown clear
conscious no broken bones but she would
have a nasty gash in the top of her head
that would require stitches I would fly
over the front quarter panel of the scar
and I&#39;d be up I&#39;m conscious no broken
bones 45 miles an hour we hit this car
however when I&#39;m up I&#39;m on fire I&#39;m like
on fire and I&#39;m telling you it does not
look like you look at a cartoon or
you&#39;re you know a fire pit or a
fireplace it&#39;s not like that when you&#39;re
actually on fire I&#39;m guessing maybe not
everybody here has had that happen it&#39;s
kind of extraordinary commend it but
here here I am right and there is one
thought that goes through my mind what
do you think it was stop drop and roll
yes right the fire department are you
freaking kidding me I never paid
attention the fire department as a child
apparently I did and thank goodness
because that&#39;s exactly what I did and I
started rolling it rolling I rolled for
what seemed like forever but what they
should be saying is stop drop and roll
roll roll baby and keep on rolling
because when you got gasoline on 40% of
your body it doesn&#39;t go out when you
roll so easily
my girlfriend would come over and put
her arm down
on my right leg that was burned even
worse than this to put the fire out I&#39;m
sitting in the ambulance going to the
hospital right and we&#39;re about to leave
and the paramedics there and I don&#39;t
know I just
this is where my head was I said with my
luck I&#39;ll die on the way to the hospital
and the paramedic without missing a beat
says with this guy driving you&#39;re
probably right and we just laughed
we laughed guys and we laughed while the
pain that I was enduring at this moment
was excruciating I remember thinking to
myself oh my god I&#39;d never felt pain
like this and they never had since and I
remember thinking oh my gosh if I can
just get the drugs it&#39;ll be better and I
tell you it didn&#39;t even it paled in
comparison to the pain of those
scrubbies as they would debrie you know
and keep the infection down three skin
graft operations 30 days in the hospital
pain like I&#39;ve never endured in my life
six months of physical rehabilitation
but you know the worst pain of all was I
became so bitter and angry at this
individual that had pulled out in front
of me I I looked at life and I say how
did this happen to me I was struggling
to to make it in life right that had the
best opportunities and life here I was
trying to make and all of a sudden this
shit happens are you freaking kidding me
see I&#39;d become a victim I think guys you
could you could sum up all of human
history in two words challenge choice
from the dawn of man to this point in
time from this point in time all the way
into the future for every single one of
his challenge choice moment after moment
after moment grain of sand after grain
of sand that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about and
he really only got two choices there&#39;s
no in-between you&#39;re either leading in
life or you&#39;re a victim and I was
squarely in victim space I plan to kill
this guy it had pulled out as an
accident he pulls out in front of me
it&#39;s an accident he&#39;s a foreign national
he doesn&#39;t even belong in our country he
doesn&#39;t have any insurance he doesn&#39;t
have a driver&#39;s license how did he even
cut a car I don&#39;t know never came to the
hospital and I plan to my
murder this guy and just so you know
that obviously did not happen never had
the horrible misfortune have to do that
but that&#39;s where I was if you think
about life guys life is like a vast
ocean that we all must cross as the
captain of our ship we are either at the
helm or we&#39;re not at that point in time
I was not at the helm of my ship and how
often are we not at the helm of our ship
not consciously present of the precious
sand that&#39;s going to the neck of our
hourglass that&#39;s where I was in this
vast ocean that we must cross has
countless dangers perils difficulties if
you&#39;ve not faced them yet I know
everyone in this room has but if you
haven&#39;t just hold on it&#39;s coming and
more important than the actual challenge
is going to be the choice of how you
respond to it and whether or not you&#39;re
at the helm of your ship and what I&#39;ve
observed in my life and the life of
those around me is that there are seven
behaviors that literally come from our
ego that that just occupy and keep us
out of the neck of the hourglass they
they lead to our worst self and the
craziest thing of all is they begin with
the letter C how stupid is that will you
tell me let me talk to you about them
competing we learn very early to compete
in life to win at all cost in everything
to include relationships are you getting
me second place is first loser
everything is about competition isn&#39;t it
true everything in our life we&#39;ve taught
that comparisons we learn to stack up
our value and our sense of Worth against
other people am I good enough do I make
enough am i smart enough and that
becomes the lens through which we
evaluate our importance or not and then
there&#39;s chasing what are we chasing we
have you ever found yourself saying
something like I&#39;ll be happy when X
whatever X is X happens X occurs it&#39;s
like you&#39;re striving but never arriving
you&#39;re constantly looking for something
else as opposed to realizing that all we
have is the present moment none of us
knows how much sand we have left none of
us and then there&#39;s controlling
controlling oh my god the mother of all
sees maybe it comes from here I don&#39;t
know but it&#39;s incredible right what do
we try to control who do we try to
control we try to control all of life
and all the people in our lives
meanwhile life&#39;s gonna do it life does
we have no control people are gonna do
what people are gonna do it&#39;s their life
we don&#39;t even have control of ourselves
I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;m gonna make the
time live it or not I&#39;m hoping and then
there&#39;s complaining and criticizing
complaining oh my god can you find one
human being on the planet that can spend
a whole day I can&#39;t do it i tried it
forever I can&#39;t do it where I&#39;m not
complaining about why life is not
treating me fair for some stupid reason
work criticizing oh my god criticizing
it&#39;s like you know we we sit there as
human beings and we&#39;re constantly
judging and evaluating and and in
passing verdict on everyone else around
us are you freaking kidding me
and on ourselves no us and then finally
clinging clinging what are we clinging
to we&#39;re clinging to the past
we&#39;re clinging to knowledge to our
worldview our paradigms the way we see
it
we&#39;re clinging to others we&#39;re clinging
to our notion about what it means to
live and to be happy we&#39;ve got to find a
way now that we have this important
knowledge of the seas and we&#39;re gonna
see them in our lives we have to be able
to have something that&#39;s going to allow
us to take hold of the helm of the ship
because when we&#39;re caught up in the seas
we aren&#39;t at the helm of our ship and I
told you about stop drop and roll now I
want to tell you about
stop dropping me a simple phrase that
you can remind yourself and become habit
with when you see the cease operating in
your life just remember that stop
dropping me stop drop your anchor and
just being be present you can focus on
the breath but get curious ask yourself
the question why why are these seas
showing up in my life and you will
create space for yourself you will
create space to choose differently well
what am I going to choose well that&#39;s up
to you it&#39;s your life you&#39;re the captain
of your ship but I&#39;m gonna throw some
things at you right now that I think are
absolutely worthy of consideration
careful consideration instead of
competing why not be flexible and
generous flexible like the palm tree in
the hurricane Ben don&#39;t be like the oak
that gets ripped up generous it&#39;s
incredible to me how much we have to
give to others that cost us nothing why
would you not give it to them one guy
said to me son when time said well press
on they&#39;re not asking for it who cares
give it to them anyway
if it costs you something give it away
you&#39;re not taking it with you be
grateful and content instead of
comparing yourself to others assume the
attitude of gratitude in all things
right a gratitude list pull it out when
you&#39;re feeling down I swear to you in
two minutes your life I mean everything
will change we have so much to be
grateful for more than kings and queens
most of us 100 years ago it&#39;s
unbelievable if you stop and you you
take that perspective and instead of
chasing why not simplify what does that
mean simplify simplify your life focus
on only that which is most important to
you just live your life your precious
sand there and instead of controlling
why not be accepting the accepting of
life I spent over six months God years
with futile resistance not accepting
that I&#39;ve been burn up in a motorcycle
accident can you think I mean I wasted
my sand and when you talk about
accepting be accepting of other people
all our differences accept it celebrate
it
accept yourself accept yourself love
yourself and then instead of complaining
be positive be be what positive
psychology has shown us is the way to be
in life for ourselves and for everyone
around us to be happy be playful matter
of fact I want to introduce you to
somebody
dr. Tyson would you come up here sir
please thank you very much thank you
very much dr. Tyson yes dr. Tyson I love
this guy
right I love dr. Tyson because he
reminds me life is too short and too
precious not to just stop and touch stop
taking it so seriously stop stop taking
everyone and everything in yourself so
darn seriously to be kind to be
compassionate instead of criticizing
everyone around us be kind be
compassionate think of a most difficult
individual you&#39;ve ever had to be around
if you really knew their whole life
story everything that had brought them
to that point in time wouldn&#39;t she be
gentler kinder more compassionate
towards them I&#39;ve rarely found someone
that disagrees with that and one guy
said to me then he said well that&#39;s
ridiculous I can&#39;t possibly know
everyone&#39;s story around me
I said that&#39;s true but you just raised
your hand and said you&#39;d be gentler
anyway if you did so why not start there
as a default position it makes logical
sense to me treat everyone with kindness
and compassion and instead of clinging
why not just let go let go of it all let
go of everything let go of the Seas
choose the behaviors that are born of
love here it is this is what it&#39;s all
about guys born of love guys are in the
room thinking he just told me the love
word yeah that&#39;s exactly it it&#39;s
brotherly sisterly love if we are not
here to make life easier for one another
what in the hell are we here for
seriously right you want to make every
grain of sand count
please do make sail the seven seas your
bridge between past and future your
bridge to the neck of the hourglass to
the present moment to every grain of
sand mattering make it the bridge to
your best self your authentic self your
most effective make it your bridge to
Nelson or leadership be a leader in life
don&#39;t be a victim anymore you don&#39;t have
to be
it&#39;s your choice a moment to moment I
want to tell you full circle a little
bit more about the story when I was in
the hospital my dad quit his job he came
out to see his son and a couple days in
gave me this key Jay I&#39;ve been carrying
that keychain in my pocket for over half
my life and this is what it said on
things will turn out all right
I can&#39;t see it anymore there&#39;s a couple
little indentations there but imagine a
boy&#39;s father comes to see his son I&#39;ll
burn up in the burn unit I mean he loves
him to death
and his his boy loves him too and he
can&#39;t do anything to make it better and
he goes in that keychain
make you freakin kidding me I&#39;d love to
be able to sit there to tell you that I
looked at that I said dad oh my god that
wisdom will carry me through the pain
the pain of life the ups and downs and
everything it&#39;ll be awesome
but I said something more along the
lines are you effing kidding me that&#39;s
what you got for me right now get me
some more frickin pain medicine but
isn&#39;t it true guys isn&#39;t it true that in
fact life that is how it works in time
things will turn out alright it always
does it always does
how do I know that here&#39;s here&#39;s why I
know that I would have never had this
beautiful family my gorgeous wonderful
soulmate my wife Kim who is every bit
part of this my three boys who I can&#39;t
stop clinging to the news flash I&#39;m okay
if I don&#39;t see you guys I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
want that but if I never saw you again
it would be okay but I can&#39;t stop
clinging to that but I&#39;m so grateful to
have had this time with you I really
mean that from the bottom my heart and I
would love to get to know you on a
deeper level I really really mean that
sincerely I&#39;m so grateful to have been
burn up in a motorcycle accident I was
burned alive guys that was part of the
life my sand did not stop there I don&#39;t
know when it&#39;s gonna stop but I
encourage you to live every single
moment to its fullest and I want to say
thank you than the bottom of my heart
[Applause]
