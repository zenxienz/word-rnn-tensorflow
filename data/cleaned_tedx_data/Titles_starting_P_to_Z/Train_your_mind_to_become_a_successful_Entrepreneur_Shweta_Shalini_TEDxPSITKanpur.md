so hello and a very good afternoon to
all of you let me first start by
thanking psi T and Ted for giving me an
opportunity to stand in front of the
future leaders of India and the future
of tomorrow and give my ideas on a
wonderful topic like ideas in you but
today because there are so many
youngsters here I want to talk about my
own story and this is the story where I
am the hero yes in every story and in
every one story one is the hero but I
come from Mumbai and you will find these
phenomenal artists in Mumbai in a place
called Bollywood where these artists
could be script writers producers
directors and even music directors of
their own films I pretty much very early
in my life realized that I am the author
of my own life and that&#39;s what I wanted
it to be but I also realized that I&#39;m
not only the author of my own life I&#39;m
the master of my own fate I am the
captain of my own soul and I&#39;m the king
of my own dreams and that is when I set
out towards my journey to be where I am
the best thing about you being the
author of your own life is
that you can draw out the character of
your own hero how you want the hero to
be what should be the character
what is the role that you want the hero
to play and as I stand in front of you
it is an immense pleasure to tell you
that today I&#39;m a mother of two young
boys a successful wife of an even more
successful husband a loving daughter of
two sets of parents an entrepreneur a
social activist a politician and now a
TED speaker but how do you think I
achieved all of this today&#39;s group
Europe and I think I am going to give
out the guru mantra of my life on this
platform in fact for all of those who
follow me on social media I give out
these mantras for the young youth of
tomorrow under the hashtag of sweet
Nitti because when I follow these
strategies I was successful and I can
guarantee you that if you follow this
strategy you are going to be successful
as well because life is as simple as it
gets you saw and you read so when I
started out what is it that I thought in
my head it was very simple in my head
your life is like a car and your mind is
the driver and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard all
this before it&#39;s all in the mind
and you need to motivate yourself and
all other sorts of bullshit but let me
tell you motivation is nothing
it&#39;s like bathing you need to get up
every single day and motivate yourself
to do better than what you did yesterday
and so I thought my driver of my own car
needs to be trained and like every good
driver who handles a car knows that the
best driver is somebody who manages the
car with the accelerator and trust me if
your tree if you train your mind well if
you have a trained driver you do not and
you will never break in your life but
what&#39;s crucial is how do you train the
mind if it was so easy everyone would
have done it but there are tricks and
more importantly there are threats how
do you think somebody becomes extremely
successful and why do some people fail
they all have similar minds but the key
lies not on the accelerator not on the
brake but it is the clutch because the
gears in your life shift when you learn
how to operate the clutch of your life
and for operating the clutch of your
life one you need to push it second you
need to release it
and you need to relieve it like that
very simple theory but my own theory
your mind is trained to save you from
risks so every time when you drive and
you see that the road is empty and now I
want to accelerate and from the third
gear I want to push on to the fourth
gear and from the fourth gear I want to
push on to the fifth something in your
mind works and says no no no no no hold
on you know you can topple down probably
this is not the right time wait you
could you could have a turn you could
have a fast wake from in front that is
habit it&#39;s habitual for your mind to be
trained to stop you from getting hurt
it&#39;s habitual
for your mind to save you from any kind
of risk but you need to trick your mind
and how do you trick your mind five four
three two one and snap you take the
decision yes I will put the gear so it
is the clutch which is extremely
extremely important and this is what the
young should understand and for that you
need to push your limits for that you
need to release everything all your mind
blocks and give it your best eye when
the entire world was trying to get into
the dot-com wave I set out to do
mechanical engineering there were hardly
girls in my class but I wanted to do
mechanical engineering because that is
what my script said when everyone passed
out of engineering like most of you all
will
and opted for high-paying IT jobs during
that time I decided to go back to an
engineering company a Swedish
multinational because that&#39;s what I
thought that I had studied for and
that&#39;s where my engineering degree and
my marketing MBA degree could be used
but yes I had to apply the clutch and
change the gears because this
multinational Swedish company had never
ever taken a woman in their marketing
and sales roles and I pushed my limits I
gave the interview five times but got
through and what&#39;s crucial and what&#39;s
important is after giving my eight years
to this organization today when I stand
here I know that there are four hundred
young women who work for that
organization so when you pay for
something not done before it&#39;s gonna be
difficult for you and you are going to
be challenged but remember you will be
followed and you will lead by example
and that is the crucial idea that can
change your life so what exactly how do
you train your mind or how do you trick
your mind very simple and I followed a
very very simple methodology every time
that I wanted to take a decision every
time that I was tapping out beyond my
limits I thought to myself am i
different
am I being different am i thinking
different and most importantly am i
making a difference to somebody if not
to the country if not to the society am
I making a difference to myself my
family my own people and that&#39;s what I
tried all my life I was an outlier but
when you are outlier you can be
outstanding and that&#39;s what life has
proved to me and that&#39;s what I tell
young people like you don&#39;t be scared to
take risks your mind is going to stop
you
habits are going to stop you your people
around you I&#39;m going to save you from
the risk your mum is going to ask you so
I was working in this fantastic Swedish
multinational company and very soon in
about six years time with a multiple
promotion earning much more than what my
counterparts were earning in the IT
companies that they had joined and one
fine day I quit I quit and when my dad
asked me what is it that you quit for I
said I want to be an entrepreneur he
said what the hell is that I said I want
to do something on my own he turn around
and said don&#39;t business kruky my father
was also director of an engineering
college like that till about a couple of
months ago
and they opened a small entrepreneur
ship development cell and they called me
as the chief guest and while on stage as
I was sitting with my father he walked
up to the mic first because I was the
chief guest and he said this is the girl
who has taught me the meaning of
entrepreneurship
everyone will come back to you if you
believe in yourself and if you are able
to trick and train your own mind and so
what started off as a journey with a few
thousand rupees is today multiple
business lines and a few hundred crore
business and why I could do it I could
do it
because when I realized that my mind is
getting comfortable in my job getting
promotions getting a salary back home
having a car that&#39;s when I tricked my
mind
I tried four three two one and I quit
today we have few thousand people around
the globe offices across different
nations and what we do is we teach
people something called as design
thinking which means we teach people how
to be different with each corporates how
they need to make products which are
products made differentiated from what
is available in the market today and
that is when they can be innovative
and they can lead the change we teach
young people like you how innovation and
research is crucial to be employable and
while everyone else would have enjoyed
being successful earning the profits
after so much of hard work I realized I
had tricked my mind once again into
walking over to other youth other women
and hand-holding them so that they could
set up enterprises of their own so that
they could do a start-up of their own I
traveled across nation across my own
state and helped talked supported and
hand held other people to ensure that
they built an ecosystem to grow as
entrepreneurs and one in this process I
realized that there are so many people
like me who wanted to contribute to
their societies to other people they
wanted to give up and that&#39;s when I knew
that I needed a platform where people
could come together and volunteer for
their Nations for their societies for
other people selflessly like they needed
nothing out of it because I needed
nothing out of it
and so from an engineer to an employee
to an entrepreneur all of a sudden I was
a social activist I built a platform
which is called mocumentary mythril in
which if you want to volunteer for your
nation you can just pump up and spend
ten hours of your week
by giving your skillset by giving your
time and giving your effort for your own
nation for your own people and I was all
I was doing was thinking different I
realized I had traveled the world in UK
people give 25% of your of our own time
to the society I had traveled to the US
where it is mandatory for volunteerism
to be a part of your curriculum and in
India
philanthropy only meant check
philanthropy and that&#39;s when I decided
there have to be people like me who want
to walk over the bridge and tell to
others I want to help you and I need
nothing from you all they needed was
somebody to connect them somebody to
think a little beyond think different
and that&#39;s what I did
I created a platform while I was
creating this platform and of course on
the side I had a wonderful opportunity
to work with then Chief Minister and now
the current Prime Minister and very soon
from being a social activist
today I represent the world&#39;s largest
political party called party a Giunta
party one of the most vibrant state the
state of Maharashtra and I work an
advice one of the most dynamic young
chief ministers that India has mr.
Devine referred novice
part of my script that I had written for
myself all because I believed that I am
the hero and I am the author of my own
life all because I was thinking
different today
as a politician it is important that we
move towards a society which is educated
and understands collaborative Nassif
Nassif of the youth India is the only
country which has 35 percent population
lesser than 35 years of age Maharashtra
the state that I come from has 50%
people less than 35 years of age but how
long are we going to have this advantage
exactly 15 more years so in 15 long
years we have to do together dream
together and work together to take India
to where we want it to be and that&#39;s how
I thought different so when I started
working with the Honorable Chief
Minister we worked on a plan and under
his chairmanship we came up with this
fantastic plan of collaborative
convergence mechanism and methodology
where we have adopted about thousand odd
villages in thousand or villages we are
going to create model villages out of
each one of them
and you&#39;ll be delighted that with one
thought of the Honorable Chief Minister
corporates have lined up to come and
collaborate and partner with this
initiative so we have all the big names
all the corporates with us in this
initiative but that&#39;s not what I don&#39;t
want to talk about what I want to talk
about is in this initiative I came up
with this advertisement which said
because we want to change Thousand
Villages
we need thousand twenty to twenty five
year-olds to leave their jobs come and
stay with us for two years in the
villages between the villagers in their
houses and work for them and we will not
give you a salary we will only give you
a stipend can you imagine how many
people applied more than five thousand
people applied and we selected just
about two hundred and fifty out of them
and these 250 boys and girls mind you
twenty percent girls go down to the
villages stay in the houses eat with the
villagers in their homes and they have
taken up on themselves to change the
face of the village and today I must
admit that I see a Shwetha shalini in
all of them and so can I see a different
person a different mind a well trained
driver in each one of you sitting here
all I have to say is we have one life
one song unites us all if I play one
song the national anthem all of you are
going to stand up and unite for the
pride of the nation
it&#39;s got to be pitch dark but I light
one candle and there&#39;s going to be light
huge ships lose their way but when they
want to come back on their own path they
look at just one star which is called
the pole star I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the
Honorable Prime Minister saying this
every boat comes one vote counts and
that&#39;s your water in a very similar
manner one life we have one decision we
need to take and the decision is to be
different is to make a difference
remember with everything you do make a
difference to your society to your
country and to yourself my story will
continue because I&#39;ve just about started
my plot is fixed but what&#39;s important is
for the next 15 years India needs you
thank you so much
[Applause]
you
