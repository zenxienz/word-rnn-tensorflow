people talk about thinking outside the
box I&#39;d like to start with thinking
outside the galaxy alien invasion yeah
that&#39;s what I said
alien invasion I&#39;m a big sci-fi fan and
one of the scariest books I ever read
was a sci-fi novel where an alien race
came across the galaxy to take over our
planet they found a way to surround the
entire globe with clouds and from these
clouds it started to rain and we just
thought oh there&#39;s some weather and it
rained for days and in that rain there
were seeds and these from the seeds grew
plants exotic vines and flowers began to
bloom everywhere and these plants took
in our oxygen and emitted their
environments can you picture it without
a single shot fired they&#39;d terraformed
our planet and adapted our environment
so they could thrive now the thing that
made it so scary was how logical it was
forget all the other scenarios forget
every sci-fi movie I&#39;ve ever seen I&#39;m
pretty sure that&#39;s how it would be done
if it ever happened so my idea for you
is why can&#39;t we take over the planet why
can&#39;t we adapt our environment so we can
thrive I&#39;m talking about a
no-holds-barred no rules no preconceived
notions on how things are supposed to be
done all-out takeover and why not start
with our offices our homes in our city
and adapt our environment so we can fit
the future now adapting our environment
isn&#39;t a new idea it
just a hard one to conceptualize when
you&#39;re standing in its predecessor I&#39;m
talking about challenging our
imaginations to look at the norm and
expand its potential an example I&#39;d like
to put to you is the formal living room
now how many of you remember the formal
living room oh I do I remember it
because we weren&#39;t allowed to go in
there and we certainly weren&#39;t allowed
to sit on anything especially at my
grandmother&#39;s house you know my brother
and I thought her oriental rug was a
perfect racetrack for our Matchbox cars
but historically the formal living room
was a large space located in the front
of the house used for formal gatherings
most especially funerals and wakes now
somewhere along the line somebody
decided that giving all that prime real
estate in the house to a room that
nobody goes into with furniture nobody
sits on was a really a bad idea
and like why it&#39;s that tiny enclosed
kitchen in the back of the house where
it was originally meant for a hired cook
or just to be on the outskirts in case
of fire shouldn&#39;t be the room that mom
gets banished to to make dinner all by
herself and there you have it the great
room was born
it only took 75 years for us to break
with what we were used to and open up
that room so that young and old male and
female could hang out in one place and
go about the business of life humans are
social animals for all of you addicted
to your phones I&#39;m sure you would agree
but today you&#39;ve got mom and making
dinner kids doing homework dad checking
its email all in one great room a great
example of adapting our environment so
we can thrive which leads me to an
important part of any
invasion the aliens now the Oxford
Dictionary definition of alien is
unfamiliar and disturbing
now the tone of that sounds a bit
negative doesn&#39;t it well is it really
I like unfamiliar and disturbing to who
I thrive on &#39;i&#39;m familiar i seek it out
wherever i go
it&#39;s new and different and disturbing
well disturbing implies making waves and
disrupting the norm I like that too most
artists do you know who you are
I might just love these new aliens how
many of you have heard somebody say they
young people today have no attention
span or work ethic have you heard them
say that they have the attention span of
a YouTube video I have I&#39;d like to
introduce you to the possibility that
you are proposing sending them into the
formal living room of the future and
they&#39;re just not interested they might
be unfamiliar and disturbing but young
people today are brought up with more
knowledge entertainment and news at
their fingertips than you or I could
ever have imagined
at their age they&#39;re sponges in this
media driven world we&#39;ve created they
have been exposed to a tremendous amount
of input so much so that maybe it
doesn&#39;t fit right in a cubicle or an
assembly line we might just need to
adapt our work environment for the new
workforce ahead for the new aliens and
the new alien invasion veneers back I
remember visiting Boston and spending
time with my niece Madison I asked her
if she was cited about being in her
final year of elementary school she said
what do you mean I&#39;m in my first year of
middle school
I was like wow that&#39;s crazy we finished
in the 6th grade with a diploma and a
ceremony and everything why did they
change it and she stood up faced me
their hands on her hips and said they
can&#39;t keep us for the little kids we
know too much very unfamiliar and
disturbing but true they they have grown
up in a global social atmosphere where
everyone has an all-access pass many
times we send young people into a work
environment that might as well be a
scene from a black-and-white movie but
it&#39;s time to rethink our perception of
normal it&#39;s time to adapt our
environment so we can all thrive we need
to evolve to inspire we can&#39;t expect new
people to fit in an old mold I propose
stepping outside of our preconceived
world and rethinking the architecture
and design of the workplace to inspire
creativity productivity and happiness I
hate to quote dirty dancing but nobody
puts Baby in a corner
it&#39;s irrelevant poised have you ever
been asked to sit at a desk facing a
wall I have it&#39;s awful during one office
redesign when I was in New York a
carpenter built desk surrounding the
entire perimeter of the room I couldn&#39;t
take it I can&#39;t create facing a wall
nobody could the first thing we did was
figure out a way to build Peninsula
desks jutting off the sides so we could
all face each other and generate a
better energy in the room
the results were phenomenal companies
like Google and Southwest have figured
this out
they&#39;ve broken boundaries in design
they&#39;ve created treehouse conference
rooms and treadmill think tanks and
prove that the F word fun does have its
place in the workplace if we could
terraform our city with fun what would
it look like would people travel from
near and far to see it if we built it
would they come would it bring back the
days of the great American road trip
where people couldn&#39;t wait to get off
the highway and see what a town had to
offer would we take a picture at a
thirty-foot pair of cowboy boots eat
breakfast at the giant donut or spend
our day in a climbing wall in Central
Park I&#39;m in the process of mounting a
spinning cowboy on the roof of our
building there&#39;s a serious link between
fun happiness and productivity and I
have to agree fun is an amazing
motivational tool it&#39;s what gets me out
of bed the morning suddenly an office
isn&#39;t just an office and a job isn&#39;t
just a job and my team aren&#39;t just
employees for many years I ran the
design department at a large fashion
house in New York and I always had at
least five young interns at a time now
on the other side of the office the
sales department had the same amount of
interns but they never stayed more than
two weeks they constantly asked me how
do you get your interns to stay all
summer now what I wanted to say was I&#39;m
not boring them to tears and I don&#39;t
treat them like mindless drones created
to do my bidding but in all honesty it
was the simple method of making them
part of the entire process letting them
know what essential part they were
playing in the big picture and why
whether they were xeroxing learning to
draw specs creating a repeat for a
textile design all jobs that could be
really tedious they were involved and
invested magically when you show them
what essential part they play in the big
picture and let them participate in the
finish the light bulb goes on and you
see the pride in their faces my happy
aliens being an essential part of the
process changes the importance of the
job once I overheard one of my interns
on the phone to her folks saying I&#39;m not
just an intern I&#39;m involved in what
happens here and they were participating
in the finish is the icing on the cake
for them it was the fashion show if you
are enjoying yourself you will work
harder longer and be a more fulfilled
person it&#39;s the whole story and it
satisfies that all-access pass their
minds have grown to expect I still hear
from some of the interns I worked with
in New York when I took my family to
visit my old office in New York the
current design team asked me to
autograph my desk they&#39;d heard so many
stories about the girl who changed the
design room invented the party closet
and hung the giant disco ball yeah I&#39;ve
always been that&#39;s one of my favorite
things that I truly believe is your vibe
attracts your tribe and I found mine
I make cowboy boots for a living I am
working in an industry that is
traditionally set in its ways but not in
my shop with an Orthodox interior design
and organization we continuously adapt
our environment like myself most of the
young people I work with were asked at
some point in their education to give up
their art and get a real job or switch
to a more mainstream major
understandable
today there are more opportunities for
artists than ever before game product
web virtual textile advertising fashion
cinematic you name it there are tons of
opportunities and their unique talents
make them a commodity not a liability
I&#39;m lucky to work with these brilliant
young minds our alien crew doesn&#39;t
really fit the typical mold well you&#39;ve
got a sculptor a costume designer a
graffiti artist an architect a
mechanical engineer and now a linguist
we&#39;re kind of the Power Rangers of boot
making but what does this menagerie
prove this cross culture of talent
proves that artists just want to create
and we&#39;ve all adapted to thrive
we&#39;ve tried something new and we&#39;ve made
it work and as long as we&#39;re creating
we&#39;re happy crossing the boundaries of
your own education can be an
uncomfortable necessity for your own
success and happiness breaking out of
that educational living room I know that
my stepdaughter the anthropologist
coffee roaster would agree but her new
life is satisfying her passion it&#39;s okay
mashups are cool and trendy and they
make you sound like a superhero I&#39;m a
fine artist Bootmaker married to a
biologist photographer
what are you or what should you be these
new aliens are the movers shakers and
makers of our future I appeal to
everyone to step outside the
preconceived notions of success and
design because work and workplace go
hand in hand
I appeal to everyone to embrace change
in their environment and have fun join
with young minds to explore the
possibilities of the future I encourage
cities to fight the homogenized sameness
to champion the local and the unique we
can evolve to inspire and terraform our
world that&#39;s all we need for my alien
invasion thank you
[Applause]
