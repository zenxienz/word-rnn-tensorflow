for about 30 years I&#39;ve been working
with women and men with psychiatric
eating disorders and I&#39;m still baffled
by these disorders and I&#39;m moved and
affected by the suffering of my patients
eating disorders such as anorexia
nervosa bulimia nervosa and binge eating
disorders are serious mental disorders
which lasts on average for six years
anorexia nervosa is by far the most
visible eating disorder women with
anorexia nervosa have a 6 times higher
chance of dying than women in the
general population and one in every two
people with bulimia nervosa or binge
eating disorder become obese people with
eating disorders feel fat and want to be
thin consequently eating disorders
mostly start with dieting and while
losing body weight
strangely enough instead of starting
feeling thinner they start feeling
fatter an obsession with body weight and
shape develops some become dangerously
thin others develop uncontrollable binge
eating and self induced vomiting as a
ways of losing body weight seemingly
super control on the one hand and being
totally out of control as two sides of
the same coin what starts as a wish to
become thin becomes an obsession with
body weight and shape and turns into a
prison of involuntary dieting binging
vomiting and suffering now we like the
idea of being in control don&#39;t we we
cherish the freedom to make our own
choices we think and we feel that we can
choose what we become professionally
whom we marry and what we eat in our
Western world we&#39;ve become more and more
obsessed with health and through
thousands of food bloggers mostly with
no education in nutrition with their
cookbooks have become a multi-million
euro industry superfoods juicing
antioxidant supplements cleansing have
become a part of daily life for many
avocados outsell oranges
currently it&#39;s very fashionable to eat
gluten-free now if you have celiac
disease that&#39;s the smart thing to do
just supplement your vitamins or you&#39;ll
get a shortage but others like me have a
choice pivotal in food blogs is the link
between food and health food bloggers
often make outrageous health claims such
as coconut oil kills viruses and
bacteria or dairy can actually cause
calcium loss to your bones and some
recommendations are outright harmful
most if not all food regiments and their
promised health benefits are based on
pseudo science as healthy eating become
an obsession for many flexitarian ISM
vegetarianism veganism are hot health
food from a hype to a trend to common
culture with so-called clean eating the
latest health craze a popular belief
turned into a new religion we warship
our bodies thin and muscular is the
ideal advertisements social media and
bloggers feed our hunger for ideal
images for healthy recipes and for
direction in life it provides an
implicit promise if I eat healthy I will
never get ill if I never get ill I might
live forever
now orthorexia nervosa refers to
individuals with an obsession for
healthy food they adhere to strict
dietary rules in order to become more
healthy not too
crease their body weight and shaped like
people with eating disorders orthorexia
sounds like a medical diagnosis but it&#39;s
not in the course of the past two
decades orthorexia nervosa has become a
media favorite and it&#39;s often presented
like it&#39;s a disorder for many following
dietary rules is a choice for some it&#39;s
an obsession and when an obsession
causes suffering or harm to oneself it
may become a disorder obsessions are
often reversed by well-informed choices
how do we make our choices I really like
wine especially red wine and I know that
heavy drinking causes cardiovascular
illness in the long run but what about
moderate drinking is that good for my
health I would love to drink a glass of
wine every day do I set a good example
for my children I really enjoy reading
scientific articles and newspaper
articles which explain the virtues of
red wine for my health love it
I cherish any evidence that fits my
beliefs yes the glass of red wine is
great for me every day but as a
scientist I also delve into the
scientific literature and there are at
least eight large - very large studies
on this topic and you know what the
conclusion is there is no consensus
about the health benefits of moderate
alcohol consumption so science cannot
help me much here and this leaves the
door wide open for me to act upon my
beliefs and drink my wine and truthfully
even if there were 50 great studies on
red wine and health I would stop a
probably still stick to my own beliefs
and this is called confirmation bias
this is a very strong bias that affects
us all and what it does it causes us to
underestimate the facts that were
presented with and overestimate any
evidence that fits our beliefs let me
tell you the story of the blonde vegan
New York based food blogger Jordan
younger
and by the way what&#39;s in a name who
doesn&#39;t want to be younger a beautiful
name
younger was a gluten-free legume free
grain free oil free raw plant-based
vegan difficult in 2014 she had more
than 70,000 followers on social media
she sold more than 40,000 copies of her
cleanse program younger adhere to a very
strict and restrictive vegan diet
younger became ill her period stopped
she lost her hair
and her skin turned orange because of
the large quantities of carrots and
sweet potatoes that she consumed she
sought help and was advised to add fish
to her diet younger chose to leave her
strict veganism then she took the
courageous step to inform her followers
of this choice she did that in a blog
post and her followers responded by
leaving her by the thousands she even
received death threats her story is a
story of choices and through choice she
became well again and the blonde vegan
became the balanced blonde so choices
determine our behavior so it&#39;s all about
making well informed choices and
sometimes even courageous choices often
it seems like we have to choose between
science and religion between rationality
and pseudo scientific beliefs between
fast food and immortality between habits
and obsession now we all want to do the
right thing don&#39;t we make the right
choice but how do we make our choices
science usually disproves specific food
health claims simply because most food
health claims have never been researched
and science is long and hard work
everyone knows that it&#39;s a good thing to
eat less saturated fat sugar red meat
and more vegetables and fruit health
food became a hype a trend a lifestyle
for many and a
session like orthorexia nervosa and for
some a disorder a continuum from freedom
of choice to involuntary behavior now
there&#39;s a thin line between an obsession
and a disorder and we all potentially
walk that line sometime in our life
sometimes courageous choices are needed
to become well my patients are faced
with these tough choices every day and I
since I can&#39;t rely on science not
completely or on food religion I choose
to eat what makes me happy and to that
that&#39;s I wish to all and to that I toast
