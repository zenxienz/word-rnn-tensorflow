I&#39;d like you to raise your hand if you
have ever gotten to the end of the year
and told yourself now what I need to do
next year is just try harder yeah yeah
and then maybe next year rolls around
and you say no no no I didn&#39;t count them
count
do-over I&#39;m really good that&#39;s right I&#39;m
really gonna apply myself this year and
then three years go by and you think
wait a minute I&#39;ve been telling myself I
just need to try harder every year and
it&#39;s like the harder I try the more
things stay the same what&#39;s going on now
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve experienced that
but if you think back to your to-do list
thing you were looking at yesterday now
I want you to raise your hand if you
have ever looked down at your to-do list
and there was more things on there than
you had time to get done and like the
worst part of it is it was all in your
handwriting and it&#39;s frustrating there&#39;s
not physically enough time to get it all
done and maybe you&#39;ve tried working
harder and faster and it seems like the
faster to go the PATA her you get what
do you do now you&#39;ve you&#39;ve done all
that you know to do today we&#39;re gonna
look at why trying harder won&#39;t get you
there now I want to show you how
checking things off your to-do list is a
dangerous distraction I want to show you
what highly effective people are doing
differently and we look at how you can
actually employ that in your life today
now since we&#39;re gonna be talking about
this for the next few minutes would it
be okay if I shared a little bit about
myself my name is Jared Hanning and I am
a classical musician by trade currently
the principal view list with the South
Carolina Philharmonic and that has
prepared me very well for my work as a
performance coach where I train leaders
in the thinking patterns of success some
people don&#39;t know this but when you are
engaged in making music whether it&#39;s
clapping your hands along to the beat or
maybe sing into the radio as you&#39;re
driving down in a car in that moment
that you are creating music you are
using more of your brain than any other
time of your life this is well
documented with MRI studies
now this is why that matters I want you
to think about that thing in your life
that you feel like you keep running up
against the I don&#39;t have enough time I
keep running up against not having
enough money and it gets frustrating
there&#39;s two truths I want you to notice
about that number one you are currently
doing all that you know to do like
really you know pat yourself on the back
you&#39;re not a slacker you&#39;re doing all
you know to do you really are number two
everything you&#39;re doing makes sense
well of course it makes sense I mean
didn&#39;t make sense you want to be doing
it right what that means is a
breakthrough in your situation will at
first not make sense it made sense you&#39;d
ought to be doing it and this is what
Einstein was referring to when he said
you can&#39;t solve a problem with the same
level of thinking that created it as a
matter of fact Einstein himself was a
musician and credits his involvement
with music for some of his bigger
discoveries and this kind of hits that
the importance of being able to access
different parts of your brain and learn
how to think from different perspectives
because that&#39;s where your next
breakthrough will come from now you
might have heard people say what you
need to do is leverage your strengths
and delegate your weaknesses
I&#39;ve heard that too or maybe they&#39;ve
said what you need to do is build up
those weaknesses I&#39;ve heard that too
in my work as a performance coach what I
found is that more often than not it&#39;s
avoid your blind spots blind spots in
our thinking are like blind spots in our
car now the only reason you&#39;d ever hit
something was because it was in your
blind spot there was something about it
your brain just hadn&#39;t seen yet and if
you can&#39;t see it you can&#39;t avoid it so I
ask that you let yourself off the hook
if you keep running up against not
having enough time or not having enough
money there&#39;s a good chance that there&#39;s
just something about that situation your
brain hasn&#39;t seen yet so I want to show
you what thinking patterns look like on
paper by printing up a graph
of somebody&#39;s thinking pattern we&#39;re
able to pinpoint right away where the
blind spot is that&#39;s been tripping them
up I&#39;m gonna show you what some common
patterns are what we can learn from them
and how to apply that to her life so
what am I going to show you is created
it&#39;s a visual representation of the work
of this guy here Robert Hartman and his
Nobel nominated value profile that he
built in the 60s and we&#39;re gonna look at
some visual representations of that what
we&#39;re looking at here is different size
circles now the larger the circle the
greater the clarity the smaller the
circle the fuzzier the thinking is in
that area it&#39;s difficult for them to
understand life from that perspective to
navigate from that perspective this big
blue guy here that would be like eagle
eye vision just amazing but having a
strength is different from using it I
don&#39;t know if maybe you took 10 years of
piano lessons as a kid or 10 years of
dance lessons or karate yeah but now
that we grow up we don&#39;t use that
strength we have a skill that we&#39;re not
using and that&#39;s where we see the
vertical axis see this green guy over
here down low showing that there is
excellent understanding but a tendency
to disregard the importance of it now
we&#39;re measuring these things across
three main areas how you relate to
emotions how you relate to taking action
and how you relate to structure let&#39;s
say these three people were lost in the
woods the person with the high value on
emotion would say well how do you guys
feel about this the person with the high
value on doing on action would say we&#39;re
lost we need to start going this way now
and the person with a high value on
planning would say hold on hold on let&#39;s
at least be sure we&#39;re going in the
right direction or we could make this
worse so we need to think about this for
a little bit which annoys the action
person to no end we don&#39;t have time for
that but burn to daylight hustle up
let&#39;s go as I flip through some of these
notice that they are very unique the way
people look at the world and understand
and value what they understand it&#39;s
almost like a fingerprint as unique as
they are
now right here we&#39;re gonna focus on the
top part of this graph when we talk to
somebody and say are there ever more
things on your to-do list than you have
time to do they say oh yes okay have you
tried working harder and faster oh my
gosh boy I&#39;ve totally tried that and
what happened at the end of the day well
man I got to tell you at the end of the
day I returned 200 emails and had 27
phone calls I went to three meetings I
even skipped lunch okay what&#39;d you get
done oh look what I did was I had 100
emails and 27 phone calls okay what&#39;d
you get done well it&#39;s this feeling that
no matter how busy they were they didn&#39;t
move the ball forward and tomorrow
they&#39;re just gonna have to do it again
notice a couple things about this
thinking pattern there is a high
priority on action get things done right
now hustle up for this person when they
look at their to-do list they start
checking off those two okay it&#39;s got to
take 30 seconds I&#39;m gonna start with
that and then I&#39;m do this one here it
takes two minutes that&#39;s only take ten
minutes I&#39;m gonna start there they start
checking off those small things because
it gives that immediate hit that feeling
of I&#39;m getting things done but as you
know that&#39;s an illusion it&#39;s a
distraction because no many of those
small things that you get done at the
end of the day it doesn&#39;t give you the
feeling that you made a difference for
this person as you look over on the left
they have a tendency to disregard the
importance of how people feel when
they&#39;re talking to somebody because it&#39;s
so clear to them what&#39;s going to make a
difference there&#39;s this voice in the
back of their head that goes look I
understand how you feel I just don&#39;t
care
gray because for them moving the ball
down the field is all that matter and on
the right side they have a tendency to
devalue the importance of planning you
talk to this person you say what&#39;s been
your experience with delegating they say
good golly by the time I teach them how
to do it I could have just done it
myself by the time they do it I&#39;ve got
to redo it
it&#39;s a total waste of time well what&#39;s
been your experience with planning in
this system that we&#39;ve laid out for you
to run on ok this is a total waste of
time by the time I feel like this
paperwork I could actually gotten
something done drop some nuts and you
can start to think why we call this
shape the chevron of stress because it&#39;s
like trying to solve a bad strategy with
stubbornness I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever
found yourself driving to a new location
and after a while you feel old good
golly maybe I&#39;m on the wrong road I
should be there by now and you get that
feeling oh it could be lost what this
person does is drive faster but you
can&#39;t fix being on the wrong road by
going faster it just makes the problem
worse
so let&#39;s look at a couple things you can
do that will make a difference what I&#39;d
like for you to do is to think of
somebody in your own life that you
respect you admire you look up to this
person they are unbelievably successful
in so many areas they&#39;re successful at
work they&#39;re successful at home they&#39;re
successful in their community they&#39;ve
just got it together and it doesn&#39;t
matter how much money they make or how
many projects they&#39;re invested in they
still have time for you you could
interrupt them in the middle of the day
and there would be a comma peace they&#39;re
not struggling to catch up they&#39;re not
hustling they&#39;re not sweating they&#39;d
have a few minutes to share with you the
kind of person that&#39;s been a mentor to
you in the past and as you think of this
person and who it&#39;s been in your life
and as you notice that it&#39;s like their
hair isn&#39;t messed up when they wake up
in the morning
I mean their kids take out the trash
without being asked to it yeah okay you
got you I&#39;m talking about here when we
talk to that kind of person this is what
they&#39;re thinking pattern looks like
notice that they have a tendency to
value people and value planning notice
that there is a low emphasis on taking
action now we call this shape the
leadership V and here&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t
mean that action doesn&#39;t matter it
doesn&#39;t mean that results don&#39;t matter
for the effective leader what it comes
down to is who needs to be doing it
because you see as long as you are doing
the work that means that your business
is falling behind as a matter of fact
the more you personally are doing them
work the more you personally are going
to be doing the work tomorrow because as
long as you&#39;re doing the work that means
systems aren&#39;t being built to support
you that means people aren&#39;t being
invested in to come alongside and
support you so when the effective leader
goes to work they&#39;re choosing between
building systems and handing those
systems off to people they have invested
in notice I said invest it in it&#39;s not
about delegating you delegate something
to someone who doesn&#39;t want to do it you
just created another problem you&#39;re
gonna have to go solve for the leader
it&#39;s about what does this person want
and how can I speak to them and it&#39;s
such a way to raw out that feeling to
bring it out to the surface so they can
see how their mission aligns with our
vision how do I speak to them in a way
that emotionally they want to say yes if
I need to deliver correction how do I
say that in a way that they don&#39;t feel
under attack but they feel safe and
they&#39;re like thanks for telling me that
I&#39;ll get on that next time and we don&#39;t
have to deal with any kind of
defensiveness the leader is concerned
with building emotional bank deposits in
people speaking in such a way that it
builds high value relationships because
when you do that those people start to
come to you hey do you have anything
working on is there anything I can help
you with can we work together on
something but when those emotional bank
deposits get low the Li you have to
chase them hey would you help with this
please could you turn that in please
it feels like pushing a ball up the hill
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in your
life whether it&#39;s that book you keep
trying to find time to write whether
it&#39;s the project in the community that
you want to get launched but if you look
down at your to-do list and you find
more things on there then you have time
to get done I&#39;d like to tell you about
the first rule of hold again put down
the shovel so what I want you to do
tonight when you go home I want you to
ask yourself two questions did I plan
today even if it was five minutes and
did I build relationship your power will
be found in planning and people and if
you will do those two things you will
soon find your road to success
feeling like you&#39;re after a Sunday Drive
