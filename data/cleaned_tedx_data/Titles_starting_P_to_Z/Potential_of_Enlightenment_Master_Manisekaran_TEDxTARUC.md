now I was introduced as master
my name is Aneesa Colin the master was
given to me by my students I don&#39;t have
any titles and the only legacy that I
want to leave behind is love kindness
and compassion the definition of
enlightenment is love kindness and
compassion and you will realize that we
have these feelings if you have
experience love kindness and compassion
but to be defined as enlightenment it
has to extend to the whole world that we
feel kindness compassion and love to the
entire humanity and then extending it to
even the animals the trees the mountains
the rivers the Seas and the air we
breathe if and when we can feel this
from the depth of our heart all the time
of most of the time even at the softest
level then this definition comes to be
fulfilled but even if we feel this
without any discrimination against
anyone on earth even if they don&#39;t look
like us or they don&#39;t speak the same
language or they are not of our culture
when it becomes much more deeper so the
definition of enlightenment being love
kindness and peace extended to the whole
world is only one heart but how about me
I also need to feel this for me to feel
this to the whole world
to extend this love compassion and
kindness I have to experience it within
me I must feel love towards me I must
towards me in compassion towards me this
would constitute the full definition of
enlightenment they are tools to achieve
this I&#39;ve been practicing this art of
enlightenment or to achieve the
potential of enlightenment for 35 years
and I&#39;ve been teaching for 20 years and
I&#39;ve seen remarkable transformation to
all those who have practiced this are
the tools to achieve enlightenment which
is love kindness and compassion
starting from myself the entire humanity
in nature starts with these three tools
one body movements and stillness black
movement stillness my movement and
stillness by practicing these tools we
can attain this state the journey from
here from the tools to the shipment of
enlightenment is accompanied with
happiness and joy I&#39;m going to show you
and share the first tool that is body
movement and stillness the body movement
and stillness from the beginning itself
has to have these three components of
love kindness and compassion the body
movement for example let&#39;s say I go back
stretch
standing back bend I hold my waist and I
stretch to the back as I am stretching
I have inhale so the first is body
movement and then the second is preening
move but I&#39;m breathing in and then as
I&#39;m doing this my mind is also involved
it is focused on what I am doing
physically and in the bracket as I move
then I remember these three love
compassion and kindness if I walk beyond
my capacity and I have this pain or some
form of discomfort then this tree is not
being felt by myself
it becomes aggressive so all those years
which have been practicing I started not
with this I started with so much more
then I realized so many years attaining
greater clarity that I need to live with
this body for many years maybe 30 40 60
hundred years and therefore looking at
that I realized that I just need to move
according to my capacity with my breath
awareness and my mind captivated by
those measurable feelings which I am
enjoying through this movement then the
mind when the mind is being moved in
this way to capture the generating
process of pleasure which is arising in
my movements it becomes silent it
becomes complete silence doesn&#39;t mean
empty silence means it is very aware the
second process is sometimes for example
let me show you a triangle stretch my
legs is a triangle position then I move
as I am moving down at this point I feel
some pleasurable sensations in my
hamstring
my lower back and my breath is now being
exhaled but if I go beyond this and I go
and I stretch and then I make some
sudden movements in order to think that
I need to stretch and bring my point to
the mean I could do it because I&#39;ve been
practicing for 35 years but I see in my
process the facial expression changes
students most of the students because
when they look at everyone else doing
that the importable
forgetting about these three concepts
love kindness and compassion to myself
therefore in the process of attaining
enlightenment this has to take place
that the breath the body and the mind
has to feel compassion kindness and love
all the time so if I can do this I can
be mindful and aware that I am when I
stretch I just go according to my
capacity thinking that I have to use
this body for the next 50 years maybe 30
then I would just stop where I feel
comfortable because I remember that love
compassion kindness is what I am moving
towards after some time of practice I
may feel that I just want to close my
eyes because I have experienced so much
of wonderful sensations in the body
moving according to this love kindness
and compassion I close my eyes and then
I&#39;m able to go deeper inside as I am
exploring my mind into this process
I also exercise love compassion and
I don&#39;t force my mind I just allow it to
settle into a greater depth of silence
so the body the prat and the mind is
lonely in joy and happiness towards
enlightenment when I&#39;m doing this for
many many days for many many months and
then eventually I find that even when I
am NOT doing this practice at other
times my heart my mind my awareness my
emotions are reflecting love kindness
and compassion not only towards myself
and I see that towards myself yes in the
way I do my work approaching in kindness
love and compassion the food which I
take in taking care so that I don&#39;t have
my body and my lifestyle filled with his
love compassion and kindness then
extends to my family members to my
students whom I work every day with a
meant to the entire human just feeling
this even coming here to talk is that
feeling of love compassion and kindness
to share with the whole world because
this is part of the process of
enlightenment
so with this ladies and gentlemen I
would like my I would like to end my
process it&#39;s sharing of enlightenment
with one of the most amazing techniques
of enlightenment right from now all of
that which I&#39;ve explained and shared
with you you can practice and this one
practice I believe has transformed and
changed almost all my students including
all of those workshops which I have done
where I can consider
as my students but as just people were
exposed to one small portion of this
technology and this is done again when
I&#39;m moving into the posture or even when
I walk out of come up from a chair I do
with prevalence of love compassion and
kindness I&#39;m going to show you this
technique this is one of the most
effective techniques towards
enlightenment
what is unlike love compassion and
kindness the tools are the body that in
the mind the journey is joy and
happiness
going into the posture
slowing slowly stretching out the legs
then even when I&#39;m going to and this
must be done with awareness I&#39;m still
aware of the brand body in my mind and
in a while I&#39;m going to be enlightened
like the time that talks for giving this
opportunity and all of you ladies
[Applause]
