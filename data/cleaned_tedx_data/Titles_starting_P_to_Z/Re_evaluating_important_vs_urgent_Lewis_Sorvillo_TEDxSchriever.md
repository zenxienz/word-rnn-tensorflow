so I moved here to Colorado Springs from
Phoenix Arizona three months ago and
while I was unpacking my household goods
I came across a box that I&#39;ve been
hauling around with me for the last 24
years and then this box have a bunch of
keepsakes and mementos that I&#39;ve
accumulated throughout my career in the
Air Force and for whatever reason that
afternoon I decided to take the
proverbial trek down memory lane and as
I was going through all of this stuff
and reminiscing a little bit I came
across a newspaper article specifically
it was a commentary written in 1997 by
Colonel mark moon and in the article
comes Lou who at that time was just
wrapping up a long and distinguished a
career in the army
he reflected back on his career and he
came up with a with a list of things
that he would do differently if he could
go back to the very beginning and do it
all over again and in doing so he
recounted some advice given to him by
one of his mentor&#39;s earlier in his
career and this advice dealt with
something and I suspect each and every
one of us at one time or another has had
to deal with and that is maintaining a
healthy balance between our work life
and our family life and at the heart of
this advice was the notion that if you
can understand and appreciate and apply
the difference between that which is
important and that which is urgent you
will be better able to make healthy
decisions as you get with the competing
priorities in the jewfro from day to day
so while I was reading the article again
it struck a chord with me much like I
did the first time I read it however now
some 20 years later as someone who is
very close to retiring myself I was
inspired in a different way I was
inspired they come up with my own list
of things I would be differently if I
could go back to Jane
1994 and relived my entire career all
over again and unfortunately and despite
having credible UN&#39;s words on my
fingertips for the better part of two
decades I&#39;m a little embarrassed to say
- far too much resembles his for I too
would have tried a lot harder to get
home from work every day at a reasonable
hour so as not to miss as many important
family events as I did baseball games
after school plays parent-teacher
conferences birthday celebrations even
family vacations I had one point or
another in my career I had missed them
all and sometimes I was unavoidable and
I&#39;m certainly not saying everyone should
blow off work at every opportunity but I
will tell you the assurance I&#39;m stating
here more often than not I simply
thought I was doing what was expected of
me I thought I was exhibiting service
before self when the fact is I was
failing time and time again to
understand appreciate and apply the
difference between that which is
important and that which is urgently
around the same time that I rediscovered
this article my family and I created a
memory that I will never forget our
youngest child my daughter started
college not far from here and in the
days leading up to her first day of
school she became increasingly nervous
and that&#39;s understandable this is a big
change in her life and we were all very
excited when we found out she bring two
guests with her to her orientation that
first week my wife and I were
particularly excited to be there to
support her and help her get registered
for classes learning her way around the
campus and kind of get set
into a routine we all had our matching
sweatshirts it was perfect so here&#39;s my
memories from that day I received it via
text message while sitting in a staff
meeting with the caption I love you dad
wish you were here now with that staff
meeting important sure it was it my
presence there change the outcome or
inform any major decision that was made
I&#39;m equally certain that within the case
if I could go back to the beginning to
do things differently I would also on
those days where I did tear myself away
from the office I would have left work
at work I can&#39;t tell you how many times
I allow built up frustrations distract
from our otherwise room which should
have been enjoyable times with my family
if I could do it all over again I would
be more forgiving and understanding of
those closest to me it is equally
incomprehensible and indefensible that I
could so easily and so regularly except
minor mistakes inconveniences
last-minute changes and perceived
slights from those who work for me and
those who work with me the time and time
again failed so miserably to do it when
it applied to those who loved and
supported me the most if I could go back
and do it all over again I would make
better use of the leave afforded me and
take my family back home to visit the
grandparents aunts and uncles and
cousins way more often I&#39;ve been in the
Air Force for 24 years and for 21 of
those years I&#39;ve been in a user loose
status as pertains to lead
from my fourth year to my tenth year I
lost believe almost every single year
and on the right around that time that
the air force started cracking down on
folks losing lead and then from that
point on I would wait until every
September rolls around hastily schedule
leaves often at the most inconvenient
times just to avoid losing it and more
often than not I would come in on those
days to leave anyway or I&#39;d simply burn
the leave on weekends or holidays days
or that would have been off anyway if I
could go back and do it all over again
I wouldn&#39;t have made my wife wait 20
years for me to take her to ballroom
dance lessons quite literally for 20
years she asked me each and every year
to take their ballroom dance lessons and
for 20 years I&#39;ve a tendencies and for
20 years she pretended to understand so
this is the same woman who for a quarter
century has followed me around the world
left jobs that she loved left behind
friends that she&#39;ll likely never see
again and home said she poured her heart
and soul into great for us and all she
wanted to do is go dancing eventually I
relented who knew I would have liked
this so much little gnome be so darn
good at it
nowadays I actually have to drag her out
on weekends to go dancing the last thing
I would do if I could go back if you all
do it all over again is I would ask for
help when I needed it our middle child
my son has been dealing with severe
mental health illness most of his life
from the time he was 12 to this very day
he&#39;s 24 now he&#39;s been in and out of
mental health treatment facilities often
for months if not years at a time
his condition manifested itself in many
ways to include self-harm and mutilation
multiple suicide attempts self
medication with alcohol and even drugs
at its worst what he was going through
jeopardized my marriage our family and
most certainly his life now those are
words said until this very day I&#39;ve
never spoken out loud before never told
a boss never a friend or wingman never a
chaplain or a counselor like others who
are self-absorbed
I made this situation about meaning I
eternal eyes how of me how it would make
me look as a parent or god forbid as an
officer or a commander we talk a lot in
the Air Force about comprehensive airman
fitness about taking care of ourselves
physically mentally spiritually
emotionally if I could go back and do it
all over again I would practice what
I&#39;ve so often preached the sacrifices
had come with military service are many
and they are great and they are shared
equally by all members of the military
family unfortunately for my family they
kind of show they&#39;re much more that
burdened than they otherwise should have
service before self is one of our core
values and it means a great deal to me
it means never allowing personal desires
or wants or conveniences to come before
the needs of the mission or to come
before the needs of those who are under
our charge but it does not mean for
safety our responsibilities as parents
as sons and daughters as brothers and
sisters as friends and as contributing
members of society
Colonel bloom said it should be each and
every one of our goals to run out of
career before we run out of family and
based on where I&#39;m at today
I just might achieve that goal though it
will be despite my best efforts to the
contrary so I will leave you with this
go put in your leave request leave your
work at work surround yourself with
friends and family maybe take a trip
back home or just go dancing whatever
you do don&#39;t wait until September to do
it thank you very much
[Applause]
you
