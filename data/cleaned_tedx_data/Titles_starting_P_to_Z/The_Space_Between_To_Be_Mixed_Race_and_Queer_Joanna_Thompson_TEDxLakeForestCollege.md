I strongly identify as a mixed-race and
queer female my parents raised me to
never choose just one or the other
because I&#39;m multiple identities all day
every day and as passionately as I hold
my mixed race identity and sexual
orientation to be true
I have grappled with the fact that the
world sees my truth as a falsity i jus
ana Lillian Thompson I&#39;m proud to say
that I&#39;m the child of a black man born
and raised on the ghetto streets of
Southwest Washington DC and a Central
American woman from Nicaragua who came
to the United States with nothing but a
dream for a better life hyeju ana
Lillian Thompson and proud to identify
as queer because in my 29 years of life
I have fallen in love with men and women
but ultimately see my happily ever after
with another woman now as a child being
mixed was not complicated I grew up in
the diverse suburb of Rockville Maryland
right outside of the nation&#39;s capitol
their commonalities between my friends
and neighbors were highlighted more so
than our differences however as I&#39;ve
gotten older and moved away from home to
travel both nationally and
internationally to pursue my academic
and career goals I have found myself in
more and more situations where my Miss
mixedness becomes a topic of
interrogation these situations are
fueled by constant reminders of what
makes me different from those who do not
identify as mixed race
unfortunately I&#39;m more than used to the
typical questions of what are you or
what are you mixed with and statements
such as I didn&#39;t even think being mixed
was a thing or you don&#39;t even seem black
and latina like what is that
exactly during my childhood I never
thought about sexuality much sex was
quite taboo in my family I was that
awkward only child who thought pressing
the lips of my Barbie dolls together to
kiss was incredibly scandalous or
getting caught in a closet out of all
places
curiously kissing one of my dolls I mean
seriously can only hildren be any
weirder but I digress hung up in a
heteronormative and religious family
where gay people were described as that
way or being told I will eventually find
the right husband for me made the
concept of sexuality highly binary for
me it was not until attending college at
West Virginia University go Mountaineers
when I started to meet individuals who
identify as LGBTQ and not until
attending graduate school out here in
Illinois when I realized sexuality does
not exist within the binary and it took
me almost almost twenty four years to
truly develop and come into my own
sexuality which I continue to develop
today throughout this I&#39;ve always
believed in a middle ground the gray
area reading between the lines this is
what I like to call the space between
the space that is not quite black and
it&#39;s not quite white the space that&#39;s
not quite gay but not quite straight
it&#39;s a beautiful blend of several
characteristics that in this instance
make me me so to be honest claiming
identities like mixed-race and queer
both of which do not reside on either
end of a binary but rather smack dab in
the middle makes my everyday life a
negotiation of the space between it is
exciting to navigate the space between
but it is not easy
the space between poses daily challenges
for example I struggle with feeling like
am i enough almost daily am i black
enough am i lucky not enough am i queer
enough and those thoughts Domino into
the ultimate question of well what does
it even mean to be enough and can enough
ever really be achieved during this
mental spiral into a hopeless of
I ended up feeling the need to break out
of the space between because I feel it
would just simply make my life easier
it&#39;s like my mind is telling me Joanna
just identify as one thing so that we
don&#39;t have to keep defending you to
everyone all the time but to move out of
the space between into a nice condo in
the binary has become much more of an
option due to a recent increase in
questioning of my racial and ethnic
identity and my queerness these
questions are not just of what I am but
have come to subtly discredit my
identities altogether let us begin with
my mixed race identity my girlfriend and
I first met in November this last
November and when we first met she made
it clear that she identifies as a black
lesbian and is undeniably Pro black in
her personal beliefs and behaviors when
we first started to get to know one
another
she frankly informed me that I was not
ethnic that I have been whitewashed
because when I shared experiences about
myself it sounded like I was sheltered
as if my parents kept all of the black
and Latina kids away from me and that I
was not like any other black or latina
person she knows because I just didn&#39;t
act like other black girls they didn&#39;t
just sound like me her justification for
my apparent display of a lack of
ethnicity was that due to
characteristics I embody such as I&#39;m too
passive I&#39;m too nice I talked properly
all the time I like baseball and hockey
I don&#39;t really listen to a lot of black
people music I&#39;m not
bourbon enough I say phrases like okie
dokie essentially negated my claim as
black and latina now I&#39;m sure some of
you are thinking wow what a girlfriend
but believe me she is amazing and is
very understanding and knows that me
sharing this is not a condemnation of
her words or me bad-mouthing her in any
way but what it does is serve as an
example of of opinions that I&#39;ve been
told throughout my entire life both
directly and indirectly to explain
personal characteristics that I embody
from how I act to how I speak to even
what sports and music I like have
somehow
and unbeknownst to me stripped me away
from my racial and ethnic background as
for my queerness the question comes from
a sense of confusion and honestly many
stereotypes of the LGBTQ community that
continue to divide the community rather
than bring it together prior to
attending graduate school I dated males
all my serious relationships up until
that time were with men I never thought
about dating women or even sometimes
thinking of somebody who identifies as
transgender because those options were
never presented to me where I&#39;m from
however moving to Chicago to pursue my
master&#39;s in PhD it pushed me further
into the space between in graduate
school I realized gender and sexual
orientation was not as one-sided as I
had previously thought and I am proud to
say that since being in graduate school
I&#39;ve not only dated but I have met and
befriended people who identify across
the spectrum as gender non-conforming
transgender gender queer and gender
fluid and seeing the fluidity of gender
identity and gender expression was
something I instantly became attracted
to because I already operated in a sense
of racial fluidity
so this attraction led me to explore
dating people who were the same sex as
me or maybe the same sex as me
biologically but express their identity
differently as freeing as it was for me
to become more open to dating all types
of people it confused many who knew me
friends who I grew up with back home who
only ever saw me with men did not quite
understand the sudden change questions
like so you&#39;re a lesbian now will you
ever date guys again and just because
you&#39;ve had bad relationships with guys
doesn&#39;t mean you have to give them up
for good swirled around me on the other
end the LGBTQ community did not embrace
me fully either with statements such as
you&#39;re just a curious street girl and
you&#39;ll you&#39;ll never last with a woman
because you&#39;ll end up going back to a
man they always do and so there I was
vulnerable in the space between yearning
to feel accepted by both sides while
simultaneously
being condemned by both for sitting on
the fence as I put this talk together
two questions came to my mind as I
reflected on my seemingly now lack of
minority status and confused them using
sexual orientation first of all what
does it really mean to be ethnic and
queer and second what does it mean to be
genuine of any identity I wonder if I
were to give in to stereotypes would
that make me more genuine when it comes
to my identities if I grew up on the
ghetto streets as my dad if I struggled
in the shacks of Nicaragua like my mom
if I would have just continued dating
men and never fallen for those who
identify as LGBTQ if I would simply pick
aside would all of that qualify me as a
bona fide black latina and queer female
personally I cannot deny that I continue
to struggle with questions of am i
enough and will I ever be enough as I
continue to navigate the space between I
have been and most likely will be
reminded that as half-and-half I will
never be fully black or fully latina I
have been and most likely will be
reminded that as someone who has once
dated men
I will never fully be queer enough and
yes I could feel as whole as I wanted I
could shout it from every mountaintop
and be proud of the reality I hold to be
true but the world will always see me as
two parts of a whole never two whole
parts and the saddest part about these
reminders is that they usually come from
my own communities my fellow black
latina Latino LGBTQ folks my own people
who I thought would be the first to have
my back in times when I&#39;m feeling
inadequate are the first to criticize me
and remind me that ultimately I&#39;m flawed
and so what happens now we&#39;re to mix
race and queer individuals like myself
who reside in the space between go from
here do we stop believing in who we are
whether our identities are perceived by
others correctly or not do we continue
to convince our own people the ones who
give us the most pushback for not
being enough that yes we are enough and
we should not be stripped of our
identities simply because we look
different sound different prefer to
engage in different cultural interests
or love people for their lived
experiences and not for their genitalia
do we try and establish definite
connections for what it means to be as
genuine of as a person of color or
genuine as a queer person so that at
least we have some kind of rulebook to
abide by when claiming these identities
or do we just not care let the
sensitivity and emotion all slide and
live proudly and freely in the space
between my money has been on the last
choice I actively chose and continue to
choose to lose the fear of going against
the grain I developed my own voice so
that I&#39;m comfortable in Who I am and no
longer feel a need to compare myself to
an artificial standard because at the
end of the day I know I cannot give in
to negative feelings I&#39;ve experienced
from discontent and questioning by
others who feel I&#39;m in accurately
portraying the racial or ethnic identity
and sexual orientation I was born into
and yes I feel I was born queer but I
know that&#39;s a whole other TED talk I
know I cannot change people&#39;s opinions
especially if those opinions are not
grounded in anything definitive aside
from personal ideals I know that the
pride that I have in the claim as a
queer black and Latina female is my
truth my reality and that will never
falter I&#39;m lucky to be working at center
on halsted the largest LGBTQ community
center in the Midwest down in Chicago
dealing with people every day who are
navigating the space between whether it
is my colleagues or people out in the
community I get the chance to tell
others that going against the grain is
sexy and I&#39;m lucky to be finishing my
PhD with the Department of Criminology
law and justice at the University of
Illinois at Chicago where I&#39;m
researching how racial microaggressions
affect mixed-race college students so
again more sexiness
and through this research I&#39;m once again
able to view the space between as
constructive and not undesirable despite
potentially not fitting into whatever
cookie cutter mold there is for being a
genuine person of color or a genuine
queer lady you better believe no one can
tell me I do not fit into the history of
what it means to be a queer person of
color because in America I do and you
know what I know I do my place in
history as a strong queer person of
color has been written and continues to
be written right between the lines
backed by a soundtrack of pop and hip
hop a wardrobe of sneakers and
sundresses while hooping to the basket
on the court and sliding into third on
the field with an admiration of feminine
men and a passion for masculine women
with a personality that is equally
passive and aggressive yet all
accomplished with a swagger that is
undeniably a lady in the workplace and a
beast in the streets and whether this
does this depiction of Who I am makes
sense to you or not it is clear to me as
I thrive in the places and spaces
between that it makes this world crazy
beautiful and that the space between is
in my being it&#39;s in my blood it&#39;s what
wakes me up every night and put every
night wakes me up every morning and puts
me to sleep every night or vice versa
and you know what that will always be
enough for me thank you
[Applause]
