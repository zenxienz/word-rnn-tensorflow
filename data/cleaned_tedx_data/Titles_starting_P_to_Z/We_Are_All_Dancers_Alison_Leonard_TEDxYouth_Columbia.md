I&#39;m here to tell you that you are all
dancers but some of you might not know
it yet actually I&#39;ve always known I was
a dancer
my mother even jokes that I&#39;ve been
dancing since I was in the womb and I&#39;ve
been taking dance classes since I was
two and a half years old after that I
continued to perform me taking dance
classes
I eventually danced professionally and
taught dates so in my memory I always
was a dancer but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that
way for most people as an educator I do
come across a lot of very young children
who are clearly dancers and you know
they are because they can&#39;t the song
pass without movin to the beat and some
of them continue on dances while others
at some point are told to sit still or
that they notice only moving like that
and they eventually stop dancing
fast forward to college and some of
those young children have now become my
young adult students I teach education
majors I teach future teachers I&#39;m their
arts professor I teach dance drama music
visual arts as ways of thinking inquiry
and expression in schools however many
of my students come to my class thinking
that they are not artistic and they are
most fearful of having to dance in class
and they don&#39;t identify as dancers so
reflecting on this reality that I&#39;m
teaching people who are fearful of dance
and that don&#39;t identify as dancers let&#39;s
clarify what is dance i define dance as
purposeful sequences of movement and
stillness that communicate Nene so for
example dance could be
or it could be
so if dance can be defined as broadly as
the more stereotypical dance sequence
that I just performed and the more
gestural pedestrian one I would argue
that my students could at least perform
the more gestural one and even more but
the reality is is that dance can be
defined even more broadly than that and
we all participate in it we use it we
consume it on a daily basis because
dance is all around us think about the
media music industry movies show
commercials think about the ways that we
move in our social media Facebook video
snapchat Instagram boomerang so if you
actually just think about how we perform
purposeful sequences of movement and
stillness in our daily lives for for
example our morning routines
think of how we actually gesture when we
communicate so let me back up just a
second what is a dancer using my
definition dancers are those who perform
purposeful sequences of movement and
stillness that communicate meaning some
of the characteristics and actions of
dancers are that they they interpret
concepts and use symbols they tell
stories they rehearse they perform and
they always use their bodies
individually or they perform in groups
and again they always use their bodies
and as I was just talking about earlier
with what we do in our daily dances
these are things that I argue all of us
can and do on a daily basis we&#39;re all
capable of these actions they become our
daily dances and they can be as simple
as sitting or standing but why do we
fear identifying as dancers there seems
to be an expectation that one has to be
an expert or trained and dance to
identify as a dancer there also exists
social perceptions and assumptions that
dance is only appropriate on the stage
or on the dance floor and not on the
street in classrooms or in our offices
but why is that
from the dawn of time people have been
dancing for social spiritual and
cultural reasons and yet historically
dance has been seen as dangerous because
you have to move your body in order to
dance and that&#39;s been seen as dirty or
hyper sexualized dance has even been
accused to be too feminine too
racialized
and not intellectual governments and
religions across the globe and
throughout time have actually banned
dances for fear that promiscuity or
social chaos would ensue even today some
people have those fears what do you
think about it it does seem strange that
we fear our capacity as humans to make
art and communicate using our bodies
because it&#39;s our bodies that are our
most accessible means of communicating
our ideas and our feelings furthermore
any purposeful sequences of movement and
stillness that communicate meaning any
kinds of meaning only become dance in
the way we interpret them they become
dance when we pay attention to them when
we look for the beauty in them or the
lack of beauty for the way that they
make us feel or for when we judge them
to have worth or be effective think
about all the ways that we as humans can
can move walking for example
is walking a dance not necessarily
the walking hood become a dance if we
pay attention to its movements as
purposeful artistic and meaningful
beyond its functional purposes so what
if we looked at the things that we do in
life from an artistic lens in order to
help us in life
how might approaching our actions as
dance actually empower us while they
argue that all of us are capable of some
kind of dance whether on our own or an
assisted ways in our everyday lives
think about all the move and Can Dance
that are more metaphorical when we
communicate our point of view when we
stand up for a friend when we help
someone in need when we explore
someplace new when we advocate and fight
for social justice in our communities
all of these literal and metaphorical
dances allow us to do the work of
dancers we interpret concepts and use
symbols we tell stories sometimes they
require rehearsals
and we performed them either
individually or in groups and these all
require us to use our bodies in dress to
be present to engage in tasks to think
so why does this matter as we think of
ourselves as independent individuals as
communicators as collaborators what if
we saw dance as an untapped resource
something that we could actually use and
work on purposely and like to help us
okay will you all do something with me I
hope so we make a dance with me awesome
all right don&#39;t worry we&#39;re only gonna
do two simple gestures um
if possible can you all stand up now if
you are unable to stand up you can make
some sort of up just your with your head
or your hands okay great
sit down please actually we&#39;re gonna
practice that again because we&#39;re gonna
repeat standing and sitting or that
up-down gesture several times so let&#39;s
try that again everyone stand up this
time to make it easier can you sit just
on the top of your seat so you don&#39;t go
all the back down awesome great you
might be a little chaotic at first but
eventually we&#39;ll get into unison so now
not yet but when I tell you I would like
you to stand up or gesture up every time
you hear me say a word that has the
letter E as an elephant in it and then I
want you to gesture down or sit down the
next time you hear me say a word that
has the letter e as an elephant in it
you&#39;ll work on your spelling skills I&#39;m
gonna give you this cue to start and I&#39;m
gonna go like this when I want you to
stop standing in the city okay
I challenge you to work on how you
interpret concepts seek to express ideas
tell stories practice in rehearsals
before you perform for others gain
confidence performing as individuals and
work on being a collaborator in groups
you might then come to the realization
of the huge role you as a moving person
play in your everyday life you then can
be confident and successful in your
dancing you might even be moved to
action by ideas or you might move others
to action by your ideas in this sense I
encourage you all to be dancers and look
you already are thank you
[Applause]
