I&#39;d like to begin by letting it or
sharing with our students and parents
that never before have emerging media
arts and storytelling been so important
to the world why because we live in
challenging times and it&#39;s both scary
and it&#39;s exciting it&#39;s scary because of
what I like to call the three A&#39;s
automation algorithms and artificial
intelligence artificial intelligence and
robotics will automate 47 percent of all
US jobs in the next 20 years
algorithms small pieces of code will
decide if you pass a security check and
if you get a job and a bank loan we&#39;re
fearful because there are no rules there
are no tests there are no standards
there is no code of ethics for any of
these things but at the same time has it
ever been more exciting to be alive do
you know what&#39;s younger than anyone in
this room well younger than anyone in
this high school Facebook snapchat
Instagram Spotify YouTube mindcraft
Twitter and Tesla every single one of
those companies are younger than every
single person in this high school
and they were all created by small teams
in towns with large research
universities towns a lot like this one
and every single one of those companies
found a need that needed to be filled
and every single one of those people had
a growth mindset which means that they
discovered that challenging times and
challenges are opportunities now if you
want innovation and change you&#39;re going
to have to do it so what about if
instead of just walking blindly into the
future you go out and build it you&#39;ve
got the opportunity to imagine better
and to build a future with an
some set of tools you&#39;ve got artificial
intelligence daily driven innovation
you&#39;ve got augmented and virtual
realities to bring a brand-new world
into being and you&#39;ve got the oldest
tool in the toolbox storytelling because
it&#39;s the stories we tell that bring our
future into being so what kind of
stories can we collectively imagine what
kind of jobs can we collectively dream
up what kind of job are you going to
have are you going to be a virtual
reality designer virtual reality is a
digital space where we will spend hours
learning working and playing if these
worlds will be so rich and so
imaginative so interactive social and
immersive they&#39;ll be difficult to
distinguish from reality they&#39;re going
to change industries doctors will be
able to perform complex and medical
procedures inside these worlds before
they take a scalpel to a patient so
they&#39;re going to change lives virtual
reality designers will have the
storytelling skills of a game designer
and the spatial awareness of an
architect what kind of stories will they
tell are you going to be a freelance bio
hacker the internet is not just
democratizing media its democratizing
science the human genome editing tool
Chris Burke has nine is enabling
thousands of scientists from around the
world to collaborate and thousands of
amateurs when we start to edit the human
genome what kind of future are we going
to bring into being is it a safe bet to
say that within 20 years some bio hacker
in her bedroom will take the jeans of an
animal that grows horns and inject them
into the DNA of a horse and a
billionaire will give his daughter a
unicorn for her birthday is that the
kind of stories you want to tell
will you be a rewilding strategist in
response to climate change rewilding
strategists will piece together each
viable ecosystems from all around the
world they&#39;ll bring throughout flora and
fauna to areas where it&#39;s been extinct
for years they&#39;ll rewired our industrial
past - turning out abandoned steel towns
and coal mines and manufacturing plants
into forests filled with plants and
animals they&#39;ll make new stories from
old bones if we&#39;re preparing ourselves
for an unknown future in the new world
we&#39;re going to need a big imagination
and a growth mindset a growth mindset
stems from Carol Dweck&#39;s groundbreaking
work called mindset a new psychology of
success where she asked the fundamental
question why is it in the face of
failure does some people give up and -
some people thrive and guess what it&#39;s
because of the stories we tell ourselves
a growth mindset tells is a great big
rollicking adventure story it tells the
story of how you can persist through
setbacks how you can reframe mistakes as
learning opportunities how you can
believe that through effort you&#39;ll get
stronger a fixed mindset says everything
I&#39;ve got I was born with I can&#39;t get any
better a fixed mindset tells the story
of I can&#39;t instead of the story of I can
so if we&#39;re going to prepare ourselves
for a knowable future in a new world
we&#39;re going to need a growth mindset and
crucially a growth mindset believes that
their study and their work is connected
to a purpose bigger than them be to
their family their community or the
world me
I committed myself to changing things
using emerging media arts and
storytelling I exist between the change
that&#39;s external to me the emerging media
arts
that&#39;s cresting upon us like a tsunami
and that was which I am driven to do to
change things thank you
