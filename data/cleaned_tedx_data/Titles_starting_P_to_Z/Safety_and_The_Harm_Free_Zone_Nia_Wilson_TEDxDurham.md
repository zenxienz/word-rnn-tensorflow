I am the daughter of Ronald and Elmyra
I&#39;m the mother of Heather and Paul I
come from concrete stairs salt water air
crab cakes and Campbell&#39;s pork and beans
I&#39;m a warrior I&#39;m a healer and I&#39;m a
cultural alchemist what I&#39;m not at least
not in the traditional sense of the word
as an expert I&#39;m not academically degree
there are no fancy letters that follow
my name most of the things that I know
have come from the oral tradition of
storytelling some things have come from
books some things have come through
trial and error and a lot of things have
come from what I know inherently and
we&#39;re going to stick with that thing
around inherent knowledge for a little
bit while we talk about safety I&#39;m going
to take you through a little exercise
that I hope you&#39;ll go with me for that
can ground us in our time together today
it&#39;s called imagined safety so what I&#39;d
like you all to do is this little sit a
little bit forward on your chair place
both feet on the floor put your palms on
your thighs your hands on your thighs
with your palms facing up close your
eyes if you feel comfortable and I want
you to take a few deep breaths allowing
the oxygen to just flow through your
body great now I want you to imagine a
time when you felt the most safe I could
be a time in your childhood it could be
a time last year last week or last night
if it doesn&#39;t come to you it&#39;s okay just
take a few deep breaths and let it come
on its own good who&#39;s with you
what are you doing what does the air
feel like smell like and taste like is
your belly full
are you warm now I want you to take
another deep breath and really check in
with what&#39;s happening with you in this
moment how was your mood are you feeling
happy nostalgic you might even be a
little sad with longing all of that is
okay now I&#39;m gonna ask you to take one
last deep breath and hold on to this
moment as you come back into the room
and open your eyes welcome back
how are you feeling so usually at this
point in the exercise we ask a few
people to tell us what they saw and we
hear stories around making pies and
grandma&#39;s kitchen driving for the first
time with that in the passenger seat
being on the beach in the arms of a
loved one but stories of love and family
and creating home are always the places
where safety exists people feel light
they feel full they feel tingly which I
hope is what some of you all are feeling
right now my own image is this one right
here we&#39;re on the porch at my aunt&#39;s
house in Trenton New Jersey and yes I
did say Trenton New Jersey that&#39;s me
with my five oldest brother&#39;s the most
brave people I know I&#39;m sitting with my
oldest brother who is still my favorite
person in the world and there&#39;s my dad
my Superman able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound
he just had hip replacement surgery
about two months ago and I believe that
he still thinks he can do that and I
kind of believe him too this was safety
for me being with people who loved me
and who I knew were going to protect me
and care for me and who cherished me now
what I&#39;d like you all to do is to raise
your hand if the first thing you saw was
an ATT sign bars on windows police
officers security guards surveillance
cameras or weapons
and were those things the things that
made you feel warm and tingly so you can
see kind of where I&#39;m going here we have
been conditioned to believe that we live
in a perpetual state of danger and that
the only things that will keep us safe
are these things right here behind me
but what we know in Heron Li is that
safety is much larger than the absence
of physical danger that&#39;s safety we feel
the safest when we are loved and cared
for and when all of our needs are met
now understand that I don&#39;t live in some
utopian world inside of my head I know
that bad things are happening in the
world collectively we have mourned the
loss of life in Sandy Hook in Charleston
and recently in Orlando but the
promotion of this perpetual state of
danger doesn&#39;t actually increase our
feelings of safety it increases our
feelings of fear and that has also led
to our collective mourning and the loss
of life for Trayvon Martin for Renisha
McBride for Jonathan Pharrell and just
this week Jerry Williams right here in
North Carolina and out in Sterling and
falando Casteel and these feelings of
fear actually disproportionate to what
we actually know to our everyday lives
so I want to talk for a minute about
trauma trial-and-error and
transformation ten years ago Durham
North Carolina found itself in the
middle of an international scandal a
young black woman who was working as a
dancer accused
three Duke lacrosse players of sexual
assault now stories about violence
against women are very difficult for me
because I am a survivor and so when
these stories happen I immediately feel
powerless it&#39;s hard for me to breathe I
freeze and I began to look for places
where I can hide until it&#39;s all over
with this is not uncommon for people who
experience trauma it&#39;s called
post-traumatic stress and for a time
here in Durham students women of color
and survivors were experiencing constant
feelings of powerlessness and fear and
trauma the media was everywhere people
across the country who were getting this
story through 30-second sound bites was
one thing but here we were being
consumed by it
everybody everywhere had opinions that
often fell across race class and gender
lines and for some of us who chose to
speak up we were also receiving death
threats still in the midst of all of
that there was a group of us who were
able to find and create safety we called
ourselves a boom - and we were committed
to ending sexual violence everywhere
Abudu is a Zulu term which means a
person is a person through other
person&#39;s and Archbishop Desmond Tutu
describes it as the essence of being
human it speaks to the fact that my
humanity is caught up and ex trickily
bound with yours now a group of people
who had been used to living individually
because of the messages that we had been
receiving coming together and finding
our collective power was not easy we had
all these negative messages that were
living inside of us that were being
were again being given to us in this
moment messages like black women are
unworthy unbreakable and did not have
the right to be safe and so we had to be
about the business of creating our own
safety and we did this by not by going
to the stores and buying more locks for
our doors or by continuing to hide we
did this by gathering together I&#39;m front
porches and at kitchen tables we cooked
for each other we laughed and cried
together we sang together we wrote each
other love notes and poems and we
created a world where we knew that we
were so inherently valuable that we
could not be discarded or thrown away
this again was not an easy thing for us
we had to combat all of these negative
messages and we had to seed this world
in a way that let all of our beauty and
all of our flaws be apparent because we
understood that this was the only way
that all of our needs could be met and
we did it all unapologetically
out loud and in public so this is our
day of truth-telling
where people of color and survivors let
a march across Durham in all of our
colorful splendor now understand that we
didn&#39;t live in a bubble we knew that the
things that brought us together with our
collective experiences of harm and
violence and again we understood that
creating a world where no one gets
thrown away had to include the very
people who harmed us so think about that
for just a moment we have all been
taught
that people who harm other people must
be removed from our communities through
incarceration but many of us in Ebisu
had been impacted by prisons and jails
and we knew that the retributive system
didn&#39;t heal anything
we knew that it just served to break our
families apart and increase our fears of
losses and so we kept challenging each
other to envision a world without walls
and cages this was not something that
was easy it was very exciting and it was
very challenging for for me but all of
the ways that I had thought about safety
the hiding the shunning from people
rather than embracing conflict began to
fall away and I understood that the way
to safety for me was to actually be more
visible and I also understood that
collectively seeing our own humanity and
our own values created safety for all of
us now this was really hard work it&#39;s
still hard work to put into practice
it requires the cultural shift it
requires a behavioral shift it requires
us letting go of the voices in our head
that would say we&#39;re not safe and the
voices in our head that say that we need
to look at people to measure people by
how dangerous they may be to us as
opposed to seeing them in all of their
humanity and then the other thing that
we had to do as we were doing this work
in community was to combat all the
voices from the outside that said that
our vision for safety which included
love and family was unrealistic and too
big so
took a lot of practice it took a lot of
trial and error it took a lot of good
food and it took a lot of dance parties
so since 2006 my work and community has
been more focused on creating
communities where we can transform harm
through visioning and through
intervention and prevention and repair I
work with folks in my organization and
folks in community often the folks who
are considered to be the problem to
create harm free families schools and
communities and since 2014 we have taken
over 60 durham community members through
harm Freezone process much like what we
did in a blue tube so we used art and
food and more art and community
gatherings and deep historical analysis
and deep reflection to create a
community where all of our needs could
be met where everyone is valued and
where no one is thrown away now this may
seem simple in like an incubation hub
where folks are working together but we
also had opportunities to practice this
outside or outside of our incubation hub
and I&#39;m gonna give you an example of
this two of our participants were
arrested taken into custody I got a
phone call that said that they had been
pulled over and that they were being
taken down to the county jail so I sent
out a few text messages and within an
hour over 50 family members and friends
were in the lobby of the County Jail so
the sheriff&#39;s continued to ask us why we
were there it didn&#39;t make any sense to
them these folks had been pulled over
they were taken into custody why are all
of you people in the lobby
it was also Halloween so we look
fabulous we told them that we were there
hugs and food in hand waiting for our
people to be returned to us so while I
was sitting in the lobby I also had a
conversation with a young man who was
also one of our participants who himself
had had some issues with law enforcement
and actually spent some time in prison
and he talked about what it felt like to
come from out out outside the holding
cell to come into a place when they
handle your possessions and your
shoelaces and your belt all alone and
feeling rejected and he talked about how
good it would feel to come out to a room
full of people who cared about you who
understood that you were more than just
that one moment he talked about what it
could be like for someone who&#39;s
returning home after being in jail or
prison to come home to a community of
people who believed that you deserve
healing and to be safe and he talked
about how much he wanted that for his
peers and from that time we have worked
together to bring his vision into
fruition see we show up for people who
have been harmed we do the work that we
need to do to make sure that people
regain their feelings of safety and get
their power back but we also show up for
people who have caused harm
understanding that the way to safety is
not distancing ourselves or hiding from
conflict but it&#39;s by transforming it and
our experience has been has shown that
by doing this accountability looks much
different now that picture is a picture
of us
getting outside the Durham courthouse
where we&#39;re doing something that we call
court mopping where we show up with
people who are dealing with issues in
the system helping them to work through
whatever those issues are as I conclude
my talk today I want you to go back to
that that feeling that you had that
feeling of safety and understand that we
can get this feeling anywhere even in
prison or jail if we understand the
abouttwo and the fact that our humanity
is inextricably bound to one another
thank you
