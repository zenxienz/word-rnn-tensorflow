so what have I just done
apparently I crumpled this piece of
paper and tried to straighten it again
but if you would ask the people in my
research group they would say you&#39;ve
just changed the properties of this
paper by giving it a structure now here
are you thinking what a nerds but they
are they are so right because if we
compare this to the original piece of
paper it actually bends under its own
weight but you can already see here that
this crumpled piece of paper destructed
paper doesn&#39;t now nature actually plays
the same trick with structure and so in
nature what we friend to see is a
structure that material that&#39;s called
bamboo and this bamboo is made from
cellulose the cellulose is arranged in
fibers and if you look at the
cross-section of bamboo you actually see
a lot of small holes that are have the
thickness of the size of a human hair
and so this structure actually makes the
bamboo light but also very stiff and
that&#39;s why it can grow high into the sky
now in my research group we actually try
to do the same things with materials and
structure but now we try to make
materials that have properties that
don&#39;t exist yet in nature now this is
not an example of such material this is
just a normal piece of rubber and if we
compress this rubber we horizontally
compress it you actually see that the
walls are expanding outside and this is
typical typical typical for most of the
materials we have in nature where we can
play a trick here with structure and we
remove half of the material by just
making simple holes and now when we
compress it something interesting
happens
so at some point you suddenly see a
pattern transformation and you can see
now that the walls are going inward now
we can take this this piece of material
this is very this is this piece of
rubber is still very big but now imagine
that we make this at the same size of
what we see in the bamboo then we really
start to create new materials by
designing their microstructure now an
important question here is how actually
do you design these materials where do
you start what do you want to make and
we&#39;re really trying to explore the space
of possibilities so here we use circular
holes but what if you use triangular or
square holes and what about the pattern
you apply them in and maybe you can even
think about three dimensions so the
question here is where actually do we
start this research and how where do we
start to think about this now actually
origami is a big inspiration for us
because origami artists have played with
structure already for centuries so what
you see here are a few geometries that
were made by taking pieces of paper
ribbon folding it at certain locations
and actually assembling it together they
snap together and this technique is
called the apology in origami but
something happens when you start playing
with them when you start to feel them
and if you look at the orange model you
actually see that this piece is very
stiff but if you look at the blue model
here it&#39;s very flexible and this just
comes out of the fact that we arrange
the paper strips in a slightly different
way now what I mentioned we play with
this and this is actually a essential
part in our research group we actually
want to build things like these origami
models and we want to get a feeling for
them play with them to really understand
how they behave and so when someone&#39;s
coming to my group for an interview for
a position I always find arts and crafts
skills very important so of course we
have these paper models we have these
building blocks and now the next step
for us is to try to understand how they
behave in how we can make them
so here we start actually for
mathematical objects called polyhedra
and we can do a trick there where we
start extruding the faces and so through
this technique we can make these thin
walled structures and so we have now a
few building blocks and a big question
now is how are we going to assemble
these building blocks together how are
we going to use these building blocks to
create a new type of material a new type
of structured material all right so with
a bit of math I&#39;m gonna skip this slide
quickly all right we determine we can
write a computer simulation and we
determine how we can put this protégés
together and we then take the next the
same step as before we pull this
polyhedra apart and we actually extrude
their faces to create a new type of
structure for this material so you can
imagine now that this is one combination
of polyhedra that lead to a structured
material but there are many more
combinations that we can make this way
and our computer simulation
actually does the trick for us now of
course everything is nice when you can
make a computer simulation but we also
again want to experience this play this
is this experiments it&#39;s feeling so do
the materials behave the way they were
supposed to when we actually make them
in experiments and we use simple tricks
here like cardboard and double-sided
tape to actually make the structures and
so here we wanted to make a material
that&#39;s actually flexible like the blue
cube I showed you before and so now we
can actually deform this material and
there&#39;s actually exactly one way we can
change the structure of this of this
material and as I mentioned we now have
a computer simulation so it pops out a
lot of different combinations like this
one which is similar to before it can
fold in one way but actually much more
compact under than the previous one all
right well maybe now actually we can go
to this sample you see over here and I
want to do a small experiment with you a
very intelligent intelligent experiment
and so this structure is interesting
because it can it can exhibit actually
fold in a few different
ways and so I&#39;m gonna walk here upstage
and actually this material can fold
completely flat so we combine a few of
these flexibility so it can fold
completely flat right and reduces in
volume 100 time and I went in it&#39;s flat
set is actually very strong so actually
maybe you already guess what I&#39;m going
to do we can just stand on it right and
now importantly someone worked a student
worked three weeks to make this sample
so all right and now it just pops back
to its original state
right so this structure actually
represents a new type of material that
can fold and go completely flat and
change its volume a hundred of a hundred
times a hundredfold and so maybe already
get some ideas about possible
applications where we can apply these
these materials and I also have a few
ideas and so for example if we take this
material and shape it into a tube this
tube can fold completely flat as we
could maybe use this as a stent which is
already a device used in the medical
device that it can actually be brought
into our arteries and wherever we want
to improve our blood flow we can
actually expand this stent so maybe we
can use this with this material for that
on a slightly larger scale we might be
able to make completely deformable
furniture right so hopefully we can
finally make chairs that no longer break
this foldable chairs but we can even go
bigger we can even think about the
architecture scale so here you see an
exhibit where I collaborated with an
architect Chuck Hoberman to see how big
we can make these structures and these
are actually four meters high and you
can still deform them by hand and maybe
here you see the possibility of starting
to make deployable houses for disaster
relief or maybe having structures that
we can bring into space with us because
they can collapse completely and so I
talked a lot about materials but all you
see here is
basically a prototype of something that
could become eventually a material we
really work on the design aspect we try
to understand how we can design it and
how we can make new materials but one
thing we recently started recently
started is to explore how we can
actually build these samples on a much
smaller scale so here we actually use a
3d printing technique where we at the at
the micro scale where we were able to
create these structures and this is this
result is just a month old and so just
for for an idea about scale on the right
you see the thickness of a human hair so
really by using these 3d printing
techniques you can go much smaller
another thing we&#39;re working on is
actually trying to make these materials
smarter so here you see a structure that
can be controlled not by our hands but
actually by embedding balloons that we
can inflate from a distance and so we
can apply the same technique as before
so we can apply this parametric drive
also to these larger structures so to
let&#39;s say we can apply this to the
structured material and really create
materials that can autonomously adapt to
their environment or at least that&#39;s
what we strive to do and so imagine a
house where the walls will start to open
up on a hot day to let in cool air or
maybe a roof that closes when it starts
to rain or maybe we can even think about
our own muscles and so replace these
sort of smart material so replace our
muscles with these smart materials or
maybe even a complete heart maybe we can
make a completely artificial heart and
so through play and through experiments
my group will continue building the
materials of the future so I invite you
all to keep on playing
