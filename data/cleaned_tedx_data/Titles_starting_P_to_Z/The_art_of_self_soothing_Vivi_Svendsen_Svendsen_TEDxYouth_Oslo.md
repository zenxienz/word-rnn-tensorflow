hello it is one of life&#39;s major
inevitable truths that at some point in
fact many points in life we all come
face-to-face with moments when we are
completely alone with our own thoughts
our own worries our own doubts and fears
we wouldn&#39;t be human if we didn&#39;t Harbor
such feelings
my name is Vivi I&#39;m 18 and I&#39;ve
struggled with my own doubts and worries
for as long as I can remember

in fact I&#39;ve worried until 2:00 a.m.
about things that never happened and
sadly I&#39;m not the only person I know to
feel this way to struggle this way in
fact the majority of the people I know
do I think our condition is exacerbated
by two modern inventions the first one
being social media and the second the
mobile phone you see these modern-day
necessities ensure that we are never
completely alone never completely free
from constant information and constant
updates anytime we experience anything
even remotely unpleasant we know exactly
where to get a quick and impersonal fix
so what if instead of constantly
reaching out for the affirmation we seek
we could reach in
today I want to talk to you about a
concept called self soothing it&#39;s a
concept we teach small children so that
they can sleep on their own at night and
yet a concept we lose the older we get
when we truly need it it was in
preparation for this very talk that I
came face-to-face with a serious needs a
self soothe I was pacing back and forth
in my room I was thinking about
something intelligent enough or
interesting enough to talk about but
everything seemed inadequate you see
talking this way to a room full of
people like this it was a dream of mine
but something that seemed so beyond my
grasp it was late it was too late to
call friends or family to see what I
should talk about what they thought and
so I had to handle it on my own I
started off by asking myself basic
questions the first and most important
one being what is the worst thing that
can happen you see if you can face the
worst-case scenario and have some sort
of grasp on how to handle it you&#39;re
already feeling less fearful and more
empowered so I continue to ask myself
questions could I learn from this
experience would this be my last shot
at anything like this and I decided it
might be but trying and failing is not
the worst thing that can happen and as
this internal conversation went on I
started to feel this inner glow the glow
you feel when you&#39;re passionate about
something and you want to talk about it
and you know exactly how you&#39;re going to
do it that moment
when you strike the exact right chord
you&#39;re calm you&#39;re confident and you&#39;re
ready that&#39;s how I felt and I had done
it all on my own
you see being able to handle your own
worries your own fears your own doubts
it comes from being able to ask yourself
those questions to have that
conversation with yourself to be
faithful to yourself to be your own
friend to be your own confidant and as
sure as cheesy as it sounds to be your
own cheerleader to be there for yourself
it&#39;s the gift you give yourself and as
odd as it may sound it&#39;s the gift you
give others humans are accustomed to
leveling hurt people hurt other people
and when I&#39;m feeling down and I see
other people succeed it doesn&#39;t feel
good
but when I&#39;m successful when I&#39;ve
achieved something and when I&#39;m feeling
good I want other people to feel good
with me I want to bring them up on that
level with me self-soothing is a concept
that everyone can and should use to
their advantage it&#39;s a personal pursuit
but one step towards a society where
people are confident enough in their own
abilities to want to bring other people
up there with them for other people to
want to make other people feel good with
them nobody tells you that in those
important moments in life when you&#39;re
sitting down for your final exam when
you&#39;re sitting down for a job interview
when you&#39;re going to a its head X Oslo
Youth audition nobody tells you that
you&#39;re not gonna have their mother or
your best friend or a psychologist there
to take you through each and every step
on my way to the audition I turned
around five or six different
times I was terrified walking up those
stairs it was terrifying but I had that
conversation with myself and I turned
around and I went back in there and I
did it this feels so good at the end of
the day self-soothing is the reason that
I can stand here in front of you and it
feels so good I want each and every one
of you to feel this way thank you
[Applause]
