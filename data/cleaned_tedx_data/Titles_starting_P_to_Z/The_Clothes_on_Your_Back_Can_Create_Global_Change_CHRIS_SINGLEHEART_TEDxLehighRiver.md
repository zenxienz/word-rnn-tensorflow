time for a show of hands how many of you
got dressed today all of you I hope in
that way alone
you have engaged in the garment industry
funny how so many of us are very
concerned about what we put into our
bodies but if you ever stop to consider
what we put onto our bodies and the
impact that it will have until recently
I was never much concerned as a
parochial school student I wore a
uniform five days a week typically the
same dress each Sunday and play clothes
were minimal I didn&#39;t play too much with
Barbie dolls the little wooden people
were more my speed you didn&#39;t have to
dress them as a teen ripped jeans a
concert shirt and a denim jacket was my
go-to and as a stay-at-home mom having
baby after baby after baby after baby
after baby after baby sweatpants and my
husband&#39;s t-shirt suited me just fine so
whenever he entered the workforce I
shopped for my clothes the way I shopped
for my kids clothes at consignment shops
thrift stores even yard sales I found my
entire career-- wardrobe that way and
I&#39;ve been doing so ever since shopping
secondhand is not only economical it&#39;s
really kind of fun in an adventurous
sort of way almost like a treasure hunt
and I&#39;ve really come to appreciate the
quality construction of those vintage
pieces that I stumble across and as for
delayed gratification I&#39;ve pretty much
mastered that but not only is it
economical and fun did you know resale
shopping is actually one of the most
ethical ways that we can shop think
about it when you buy second-hand you
can contribute to nonprofits and in that
way it gives shoppers an opportunity to
give back into their communities it
doesn&#39;t contribute
to the Thai the problem of textile waste
which is piling up a catastrophic levels
it prevents the need to make a product
again which protects our resources our
natural world has clearly defined limits
which we have overstepped it doesn&#39;t
produce where pollution soil or water
pollution the garment industry by the
way is the second most polluting
industry on earth second only to the oil
industry consider cotton fashion
industries one of the most frequently
used materials it is one of the most
pesticide intensive crops on the planet
it takes one third of a pound of
pesticides for every pound of cotton
grown and it takes a half pound of
cotton to produce just one t-shirt only
one to two percent of all cotton
worldwide is being grown organically and
even then it&#39;s a very thirsty crop
requiring 1,800 gallons of water to
produce just one pair of jeans aside
from its environmental impact
today&#39;s garment industry has an enormous
social justice impact did you know that
one in every six people globally work in
the garment industry many of them child
laborers the way we are buying clothing
is changing so much so fast
this current phenomenon known as fast
fashion is an approach to the design
creation and manufacturing and marketing
of clothing that emphasizes making
fashion trends quickly and cheaply
available to consumers the cutting of
corners has become the norm the shift is
changed it&#39;s it&#39;s moving ruthlessly and
it&#39;s producing a throwaway attitude
which is not sustainable fast fashion
does not look after
health it causes disparity and the only
one who loses in this situation are the
most vulnerable the lowest-paid the
common sweatshop work are making just
two dollars a day fast fashion may not
end soon but our association with it can
if we care about the planet and all of
its inhabitants shouldn&#39;t we be looking
for alternatives because conventional
trade has become so exploitative here&#39;s
how we can change the system we can
consider the ramifications consider our
impact and choose quality over quantity
we can adopt Vivienne Westwood&#39;s maxim
of buy less choose well make it last do
this and others will follow when my
daughter needed a prom gown she found a
beautiful Drent Lee used dressed or or
pre-loved as we like to call it and she
purchased her bridal gown from an
independent designer who uses natural
and recycled materials with any excess
being used for the creation of the next
masterpiece when I reflect on my
clothing shopping habits in my lifetime
I recognize that I&#39;ve grown not in my
waistline but in my consciousness I&#39;ve
grown from being merely a thrifty
consumer into a conscious consumer and
into an advocate I began wearing
secondhand clothing because it&#39;s what I
had to do out of financial hardship I
see now that it was and is the best
thing for me to do with no no moral
injury no human rights being harmed oh I
totally understand the appeal of walking
into a retail shop or browsing online or
in a catalog and saying I&#39;d like that
shirt in that color and
my size and I&#39;d like to be the first to
wear it naturally I get it who wouldn&#39;t
but when that&#39;s the case opted for fair
trade this dress came from a company who
is creating opportunity and empowerment
for everyone in their supply chain the
organic cotton protected the farmers who
grew it the hands that cut knit sewed
and packed it all of whom made fair
living wage and work in healthy work
environments and I bought it secondhand
I promise you it doesn&#39;t hurt it&#39;s not
that scary but to be clear I&#39;m not
suggesting that every item in your
wardrobe should be pre loved that would
be silly but again when shopping for new
items look for fair trade because there
are plenty of social enterprises
bringing up proving that the fair trade
model works and don&#39;t worry you don&#39;t
have to sacrifice your personal sense of
style when rejecting fast fashion you&#39;ll
love this you can download the good on

Banksy said it&#39;s possible to do good and
to feel good and to look good or solo
DeCastro co-founder of fashion
revolution so close are our chosen skin
they are reflection of ourselves and
what we stand for
truly clothing is a form of
communication so let&#39;s let our clothes
communicate our values because every
purchase that we make is a vote for what
we believe in so let&#39;s start with
clothes they&#39;re fundamental to our lives
whether you are a fashionista or a Plain
Jane or somewhere in between you can be
well-informed to make wise and
purposeful buying decisions because what
we wear matters and the clothes on our
back can literally create social change
so let&#39;s be brave everyone as consumers
we can protect our environment and
foster workers rights
so let&#39;s rock the resale and flaunt the
fair trade thank you
