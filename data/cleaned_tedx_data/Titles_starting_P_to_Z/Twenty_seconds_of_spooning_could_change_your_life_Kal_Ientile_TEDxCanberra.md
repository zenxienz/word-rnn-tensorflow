can 20 seconds of spooning change your
life
I think it can I&#39;m gonna show you how
we&#39;ll talk about adaptability bad habits
and one simple thing we can do humans
have a fantastic ability to adapt it&#39;s
made us the dominant species on the
planet and we&#39;ve continued to adapt but
not always for the best for example how
many of us use our phones like this now
we do this don&#39;t we
this is a bad habit it will shape us
over time when your head is forward and
down it&#39;s a heavier load for your neck
muscles to support to cope with this
increased load larger muscles such as
the upper trapezius have to do more work
when repeated many times this
contributes to a type of dysfunction
called trigger points or knots in the
muscle the trigger point is a small
section of the muscle that&#39;s become
contracted and it won&#39;t let go so why
are these a problem they cause local
tenderness and referred pain so trigger
points here which will be sort of
squeezed can also cause tension
headaches in the temple side of the head
and base of the skull so what can we do
to relax this dysfunctional muscle
massage heat and in my experience the
best one this acupuncture don&#39;t worry
there&#39;ll be no needles here today this
is actually where the 20 seconds of
spooning comes in now if you&#39;ve had any
neck injuries or spinal problems please
sit this one out
come over chat to me afterwards and I
can let you know if this is an
appropriate technique for you this spoon
is actually the best value for money
self massage tool for your neck and
shoulders massaging your own neck
especially upper trapezius here it&#39;s
awkward so here&#39;s where the spoon comes
in don&#39;t grab yours out
so you wrap your fingers around the
handle like this and then use the edge
slide back and forwards across the
muscle this massaging moves the blood
and lymphatic fluid which warms the
muscle up the blood brings the
nourishment the lymphatic fluid takes
the waste products away create a good
habit
20 seconds every 20 minutes well you&#39;re
using a computer tablet or smartphone 20
seconds every 20 minutes it&#39;s a small
amount of time and effort that creates a
big difference for you in the long term
we have a fantastic ability to adapt and
while our bad habits can shape us over
time so too can a good habits
