so I&#39;ve been given all of the advantages
in life I was raised by a great family
international upbringing I&#39;ve been
taught multiple languages I even have
the right foreign passport but somehow I
went and messed it all up years ago I
found myself sitting in a jail cell and
I was thinking to myself how the hell
did I get here
and why is it that I can&#39;t do like all
of my other friends who see we stay out
of jail and that&#39;s when I realized that
we all have two narratives we all have
two stories to tell
the first one is filled with all of
those defining moments those awards that
we win and those positive things that we
tell each other and here&#39;s the thing in
that narrative we have a tendency to
leave out all those experiences that we
don&#39;t want others to know we leave those
experiences and the lessons that we
learned in the past and we&#39;re starting
to see this all over social media look
at all the posts comments and how many
of us can say that we are the summation
of our news feeds on Facebook but then
we have a second narrative and it&#39;s a
far more powerful one and it&#39;s the truth
it&#39;s all those experiences both glorious
and shameful that truly define us
and here&#39;s the thing about experience
there&#39;s a place on this planet that has
stored every single one of our
experiences there&#39;s a place here that
knows everything that&#39;s happened to you
and it&#39;s called neuroplasticity
neuroplasticity is a process in the
brain that allows you to create synaptic
connections using experience what that
really means is the more you do
something the more your brain creates
pathways but your neuroplasticity is a
lot more your neuroplasticity is also a
record of your history
it&#39;s that uniqueness about you it&#39;s what
makes you look funny or or dress funny
or be funny neuroplasticity is you and
hearing you have two choices you can
choose with all your experience to
become passive you can choose to drown
yourself in social media or the news or
you can also choose to actually
experience life with diversity and you
will inevitably create neural pathways
and mold your neuroplasticity but why
not choose diversity of experience
diversity of experience allows you to
create better connections in everything
around you you learn faster you will
actually be able to navigate the space
around you better even if you don&#39;t know
it I&#39;d like to tell you four stories
for experiences of my life that taught
me four lessons when I was 11 I was this
this fat kid out in Canada in school and
you wouldn&#39;t have seen me in the
playground you would actually seen me in
the convenience store and when I was
there I was actually not the one buying
candy but I&#39;d be talking to the people
that were there who wanted candy and
what I would be doing is I would give
them a pitch to get closer to what they
wanted now some people may call this
being a loanshark I simply call it being
an enabler and through this I was going
through the iteration of pitching to
them and getting them closer to what
they wanted and years later I ended up
using these same skills in my job being
whether I am pitching a company to
investors or if I&#39;m sitting in a
boardroom trying to convince executives
there I am using the same
neuroplasticity that I&#39;ve trained and
hearing I learned my first lesson you
have to trust the process you see when I
was 11 years old there was no way I was
gonna know that I was gonna be here or
pitching to investors and that&#39;s why
it&#39;s so incredibly important and so I
went from being a lender to a few years
later being a borrower and I was in
university in the UK back then and I had
grown this passion for travel
unfortunately travel cost money and I
didn&#39;t have very much so the first thing
that I did was I went and blew it all
the way but then I had to become a bit
creative so I went to the registrar&#39;s
office and I told him hey
my father he paid for tuition extra you
know he&#39;s paid for the full year
please refund me the balance he&#39;ll pay
for the next semester next time and
there I had it I had a new pot of gold
and I started traveling again now I kept
doing this and something inside me was
telling me that I&#39;m actually doing
something wrong and the neuroplasticity
and my neural pathways were actually
creating this conflict and that&#39;s when I
was thinking this isn&#39;t right and that&#39;s
where I learned the second lesson you
have to get out of your comfort zone if
you don&#39;t get out of your comfort zone
you actually never know the boundary
that you&#39;re creating for yourself and
that&#39;s incredibly important that&#39;s how
we grow so there I was I went from
traveling for pleasure to traveling to
save a friend because years later I get
a phone call from a friend of mine and
here she is telling me that she&#39;s just
been put in jail because she was part of
a play that advocated gay rights and
that was illegal in Ethiopia so she
called me just to talk and just try to
sort things out and I flew out there and
when we were chatting we ended up
talking about what could she do should
she leave she stay and my version my
solution was that she should go what are
you doing here but she thought no no no
no it&#39;s not a big deal I&#39;m just a little
scared it&#39;s gonna be okay
now regardless of the fact whether she
left or not one of the things that I did
learn here was not a judge one of the
things that we have a tendency to do is
always think that we have the right
answer that our solution to the problem
it&#39;s the right one and this is the point
we&#39;re wrong if we think that each one of
us has had a different set of
experiences and we need to be able to
let each other do what we believe is
right and so this is where I went from
helping a friend in jail to being in
jail and this is a short story where I
was driving in Washington DC and I found
myself stopped by a policeman because I
was talking on the cell phone which is
illegal there and he was scanning my
license and he said you know your
license is suspended I have to take you
in of course I would have never thought
that this was actually gonna happen and
there I was sitting in a jail cell and
this is where I learned my fourth lesson
shit happens and that&#39;s a fact of life
but that experience also made me draw a
line in terms of how I wanted to live
life how I wanted to experience life you
see diversity of experience is important
but what is it all amounting to and this
is where I understood that I can also
use my diversity of experience to not
just benefit myself but also those that
are around me now why did I tell you all
these stories you see in a few years
you&#39;re probably gonna forget me you was
probably gonna forget all of my stories
and the lessons that I learned well the
point of me being up here is not for you
to learn from my lessons I could have
written an article on the news or on
some blog telling you that these are the
top five ways of doing this or the best
four ways of doing that but that&#39;s not
what I&#39;m
what you need to do is you have to go
out and experience you have to go out
and learn from your experience Linda
Alice wrote a poem she talks about a
tombstone and a man speaking a eulogy of
his best friend and she describes a
tombstone where on the left hand side
you have the date of birth on the right
hand side you have the date of death but
the most important part of that
tombstone takes the least amount of
space and if the - so how is it that you
want to experience life because as Les
Brown says if you do what is easy your
life will be hard let me repeat that if
you do what is easy your life will be
hard I want to leave you with one last
thought there&#39;s a reason that the book
and a movie are so different and why we
always prefer books each and every one
of us has experienced something
different in life each and every one of
us has a different imagination and a
book is simply a storyline a storyline
that allows us to maximize our
imagination but a movie it simply
dictates to us exactly how you should
picture it and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want
to advocate for you to go out there and
experience simply for the purpose of
neuroplasticity that&#39;s just
there are certain scientific reasons for
you to do it there&#39;s certain non
scientific reasons for you do it there&#39;s
also some proven reasons for you to do
it because there&#39;s also some beautiful
unproven reasons for you to go out there
and experience a diverse life I&#39;ll leave
you with a few words words will design
you but experience will define them so
go and experience life thank you
