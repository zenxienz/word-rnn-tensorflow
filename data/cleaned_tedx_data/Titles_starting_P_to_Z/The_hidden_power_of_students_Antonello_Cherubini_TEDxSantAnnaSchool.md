this is an idea about how we can improve
the way we share information today in
our society thanks to students and
thanks to Wikipedia first of all a few
words about Wikipedia it is the fifth
most popular website today it has 40
million articles and it is the biggest
source of information it is surprisingly
accurate as accurate as Britannica
botanically encyclopedia which is one of
the most renowned encyclopedias
worldwide it is also surprising that it
is written entirely by volunteers for
free and of course Wikipedia is a
nonprofit organization even because it
is hard to persuade people to work for
free for a company let me ask you
imagine if I had come to you 20 years
ago and said I have this brilliant idea
let&#39;s make a website it&#39;s going to be
big it is an encyclopedia it is going to
defeat all the competition out there and
it is going to be written by people for
free and it&#39;s going to be accurate and
surprisingly used what would have you
thought about this idea what would have
you said I would have thought that this
was a bad idea but in fact I would have
been wrong because I believe that
Wikipedia is an amazing example of
beautiful things that mankind can
achieve so we said it is the biggest
source of information today but where is
Wikipedia now how much do we get from
Wikipedia now on a specific topic let me
explain what I mean with another
question to you do you remember when you
wrote your master&#39;s thesis or for those
of you who are students perhaps someone
is writing their master&#39;s thesis
students usually put a big effort in
writing their thesis they spend a lot of
time in doing that and they will start
writing and
traduction to a certain specific topic
that will be used by their readers to
understand to get a proper scenario
about that specific topic in order to
become let&#39;s say an expert on that topic
you needed first to ask to someone else
hey can you please suggest me some books
some materials some papers something
that I can study to become an expert and
it takes a lot of time and effort to
find the good references good material
to read and usually the best shortcut to
these is an expert who suggests you
something so if they introduction that
you wrote on your thesis gives to your
reader 100% just call it 100% on that
specific topic
how much does Wikipedia give to the same
reader on that specific topic or how
much did it give to that top in that
topic at that time well I&#39;ve asked many
people and the answers range between ten
to sixty percent depending on the topic
of course me myself am a PhD mechanical
engineering so in my field this is
especially true but I&#39;m sure that it
works in many other fields too why am I
telling you this because there is a big
improvement that we still can easily
achieve on Wikipedia and the way we
share information today in order to
understand how we can achieve this
improvement and the so-called the
weekend or synthesis I would like to
make first a comparison between a
standard thesis and a weak endorsing
thesis so when a student starts to do
the master&#39;s thesis work for example
there is a first period that usually
lasts anywhere between six to ten months
in my example where the student does
some studying and researching then it
comes the time to actually write the
thesis and the normative content of the
of the work carried out by the student
the thesis is divided into two parts an
introduction that has a content that is
suitable for Wikipedia as you might know
Wikipedia only accepts well-established
information so something that is already
accepted by the scientific community
because being a general-purpose
encyclopedia this is the way it should
be the second part of the thesis is the
innovative part and this has a content
that is not suitable for Wikipedia but
is definitely it could be interesting to
specific readers so in a week endorsing
thesis studying a researching and the
normative part writing are exactly the
same so the student will work as usual
what changes is the introduction writing
that is substituted with improvements on
Wikipedia so instead of spending let&#39;s
say one month writing the introduction
the student will perform the same amount
of time the will spend the same amount
of time improving Wikipedia I will come
back later on how and the introduction
will be substituted by quick links to
Wikipedia articles that the reader
should know to get an understanding of
the topic the articles must be linked at
a specific date and I&#39;ll come back to
this later on - first of all let me tell
you the potential advantages of this
first a standard thesis is hard to find
it might take your readers weeks months
perhaps forever to find your thesis even
though it is a good work while your
contribution whatever it is to Wikipedia
is immediately available to anyone it
takes a few minutes to get to it and it
is usually a very good starting point in
other words if your student your thesis
is read by very few people for those of
you who are students I&#39;m sorry to say
but get ready to this you&#39;re going to
spend a lot of time for a work that is a
good exercise for you will definitely
improve the way you master information
and your topic but it&#39;s not gonna be
useful to many people usually while
anything that is written a Wikipedia of
course is read by many I believe this is
rewarding for the student and also
useful for the society third the last
but not the least a standard pieces is
hard to standardize this is especially
true in my field in engineering field
where we have a lot of math formulas
equations symbols different names for
the same concept different concepts with
the same name and so on if you work on
Wikipedia you are more more likely to
push standardization meaning either by
adopting a standard that is already out
there or by setting a new standard that
you like more or by anyway setting fewer
standards than before is this feasible
now again I&#39;m not a lawyer I&#39;m a
mechanical engineer but I&#39;ve taught to
quite a lot of people and legally
speaking the answer is yes there is no
special requirements there are no
special requirements in many developed
countries as regards the how the thesis
is written this is mainly chosen by the
professor and the students and it&#39;s his
students so if the professor and the
student of course is okay with that yes
now so how does a week endure synthesis
work let&#39;s let&#39;s provide a quick example
that will give you some additional
details to what I just said
usually the student will start with a
proposal as usual thesis proposal they
agree with the professor on a specific
topic then it comes the time where the
students where the student has to do
some studying researching and during
that time the student will most likely
find
some improvements on Wikipedia some
potential work that is useful to other
people to better understand a specific
topic that the student knows much better
than Wikipedia can explain now
this could be anything could be
restyling Wikipedia needs that a lot it
could be better references up-to-date
references it could be translations
it could be multimedia content for
example pictures animations any kind of
multimedia content that is useful to
your reader to understand the topic and
it could be also a revision of others
people work this is also very important
I believe that checking in real time
what other people are writing on
Wikipedia is a good exercise that we
should all do once in a life then it
comes the time to write the thesis as I
said the student will only write we will
not write the introduction but he will
do some improvements on Wikipedia better
if the it is better if the improvements
are done as registered users because it
is easier for people and for the
professor also to check exactly what the
student did the introduction is only
composed by very a very short
introduction with a list of links that
the reader should read that the reader
should read and those links are at a
specific date then there is the
normative part as usual and then it
comes the time for the professor to
revise the work as usual
so the standard paper thesis check plus
the check on Wikipedia content so you
are probably wondering why can this work
I mean a thesis is not something that is
meant to be changed right a thesis is
pieces so it&#39;s something that I write
now it works now with my content so how
can I substitute my work
with a tool that changes over time by
random people or all over the world
without control apparently without
control well the answer is that there is
a very easy feature but mostly unknown
of Wikipedia that is the page history
the view history button here of any
pages that will give you the possibility
to access an article at any specific
date that you wish after any changes
that after any change that was made for
example this is the page of mr. Dante
Alighieri that we loved so much and this
is taken two days ago but as you can see
this is not the article as it is now
this is an old revision of the page as
edited by this guy on 22nd of December
2008 the tide the summary of the change
is called the conform both titles to use
Cenotaph there is a permanent link to
these 2008 version and of course if you
click on DIF here here and there you can
see all kind of differences between the
previous version the next version the
current version this is very useful to
revise the work and this will allow
anyone to access your content that you
used with those conventions with those
information exactly as it was so that
there is no problem in understanding
they not a part of the thesis in order
to make this happen we need students and
professors above all because professors
are those who have the power to make
this happen
students might ask but of course
professors have to do the move so if you
are a professor and you want to do a
week endorsing thesis please feel free
to join the Facebook page of the week
endorsing thesis and let us know the
amazing contribution of your students to
the worldwide knowledge
