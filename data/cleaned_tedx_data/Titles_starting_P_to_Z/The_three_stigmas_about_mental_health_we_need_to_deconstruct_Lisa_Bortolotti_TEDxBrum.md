Lila remembers working on the beach this
morning with her mom she was laughing at
their footprints on the sand her mum was
flashing salty water all over her and
she felt the Sun on her face she was
happy but lillas mom has been dead for
30 years for Jamie everything makes
sense now the loud banging on the walls
the insults he heard late at night the
strange looks he got on the staircase
his neighbors are spies and now that he
found out they want to get rid of him
but nobody believes Jamie they say is
imagining things we all have things that
we think we remember that we believe
with great conviction but for other
people they&#39;re false irrational even mad
these differences in perspective make
communication difficult it is difficult
for us to understand and trust other
people and is difficult for them to
understand and trust us so it&#39;s only
natural that we tend to see these
unusual reports as harmful and
disruptive I am a philosopher interested
in the strength and the limitations of
the human mind and in my current project
which brings together research in
philosophy and psychology I asked
whether unusual reports like the ones by
Lila and Jamie can have any benefits so
today I&#39;m going to give you three
reasons why we should not dismiss
stories like the ones by Leah and Jamie
the first point I want to make is that
with some background information even
unusual reports make sense once we know
more about Lila&#39;s and Jamie&#39;s lie
what the experiences they had and what
future they&#39;re facing we get a glimpse
of what it means to be them take Lela
for instance the walk on the beach
memory contains some false information
the walk did not happen this morning and
her mom is dead
but the same memory contains some true
information it is true that Lila lived
near the beach when she was younger and
it is true that she took frequent walks
on the beach with her parents the issue
is that Lila is a memory impairment and
there are some key events in her life
that she cannot remember including her
mother&#39;s death what she cannot remember
is not reflected in our reports and does
not constrain our memories what about
Jamie why would he come up with the
theory that his neighbors are spies
Jamie hears voices and as other auditory
experiences on top of that it tends to
interpret the behavior of other people
as a hostile even when it is not meant
to be that&#39;s not surprising because
Jamie has been treated badly and
unfairly in his life and this is what he
has come to expect from his social
environment so is a strange theory that
his neighbors are spies
is a way to make sense of the
experiences that he&#39;s having my second
point is that unusual reports can have
an important role to play in our mental
lives we tell stories and stories have
different functions they are a means of
expression their way of communicating
with other people and they are a way of
understanding the world around us not
all the functions of memories are
compromised when memories and other
stories get some details wrong
telling stories that are central to our
identity as Lila does Alfa&#39;s remember
things that are important to us and
telling stories that make sense of our
experiences as jenny does gives us a
sense of competence and purpose we know
what&#39;s going on
so take Lila and the walk on the beach
memory that report contains some
information that she can share with
other people
you too are fading autobiographical
memory the information that she can
share is very limited and when there is
no information to share social
interactions suffer and when we cannot
communicate with other people we cannot
exchange information our well-being is
compromised and also our cognitive
performance we feel better and we do
better when we can exchange information
so that memory gives Lila some
confidence that is something she knows
about her past and supports the level of
communication that is required for
meaningful social interactions you may
consider it a false version of a real
past event and the fact that it is
repeated and shared makes it more likely
that Lila will continue to remember the
information contained in it what about
Jamie surely there are no benefits in
believing that your neighbors are spies
well Jamie is having these puzzling
experiences and at the beginning he
didn&#39;t know why how to interpret them he
heard voices but he didn&#39;t know where
the voices came from they created a
level of uncertainty that was almost
unbearable great anxiety ensued from
that so his theory is implausible but at
least what it does it takes away the
uncertainty now Jamie feels he knows
where the voices come from and he can do
something about
them naturally with the news or thoughts
like the ones we have been talking about
there are costs as well as benefits and
so far I&#39;ve been stressing the benefits
I&#39;ve told you the Leah and Jamie were in
a critical situation for quite some time
and there are news reports where a
response to that situation I also told
you that they were a way for them to
restore contact with their social
environment an imperfect way but away
still but a news reports like Nina&#39;s and
Jamie&#39;s are likely to cause further
misunderstandings with other people and
to generate unfulfilled expectations in
them my aunt had Alzheimer&#39;s disease
analyst Tory is inspired by what my aunt
used to say and she used to be very
distressed when she could not find her
parents around where did they go why did
they leave me here at the young man who
is the basis for Jamie&#39;s story a case
that we have been studying and writing
about was so distressed about the idea
that his neighbors might want to attack
him that he gained entrance to their
flat removed objects from the flat that
could be used as weapons against them
let me get to the final point we are all
like Lila and Jamie not because we will
develop dementia later in life or
because we will experience a destination
sore delusions some of us will and some
of us want but because even without
developing dementia and without
experiencing Alice nations and delusions
we all have heavily reconstructed
memories and beliefs that are not backed
up by the evidence and are not shared by
other people take memory we are all
creative with our past we saw the people
with dementia tend to see themselves as
they were before the unser
of their illness younger more active
more independent and they have become
and that&#39;s because they are imposing
some coherence on the image they&#39;ve got
of themselves but we all do that we all
tend to see ourselves as something that
doesn&#39;t change across time so for
instance it has been shown that we tend
to attribute our current political
beliefs to our younger selves neglecting
the fact that our views have changed
over the years and even when it comes to
evidence we are highly selective we take
on board evidence that seems to support
our existing beliefs but we tend to
dismiss evidence the challenges our
current theories which begins to explain
why prejudiced and superstitious beliefs
are very difficult to get rid of even
when there is evidence against them we
also tend to overestimate our skills and
talents believe it that we are better
than the evidence suggests and here is
an example I think I do above-average
work but in the 70s Cross asked college
professors in the u.s. whether they
thought they were doing above average
work and 94% of them said they did so
much is not on my side the research I&#39;m
doing into the cost and benefits of a
news report is an attempt to challenge
the theoretical foundations of the
stigma that is commonly associated with
mental health issues the three reasons
I&#39;ve given you today not to dismiss the
stories by Lila and Jamie are also
reasons to stop stigmatizing people with
dementia psychosis and other mental
health issues to stop seeing them as
done as opposed to us there is no as I&#39;m
done remember that one
even unusual beliefs can be understood
in context with some background
information to even unusual beliefs have
an important role to play in our mental
lives maybe helping preserve our
identity or make sense of our
experiences and 3 we all take liberties
with our stories constructing the
version of ourselves and the version of
reality the best suits our interest the
stories we tell shape our lives
they&#39;re instrumental it was socializing
learning acting overcoming obstacles and
sometimes to be playing their meaning
making unifying role they need to take
an unusual turn so here is my suggestion
when we hear an unusual report an
unusual story
let&#39;s not widen our eyes let&#39;s not shake
our heads let&#39;s lend an ear and listen
because by striving to understand the
other we can gain a better understanding
of ourselves thank you
