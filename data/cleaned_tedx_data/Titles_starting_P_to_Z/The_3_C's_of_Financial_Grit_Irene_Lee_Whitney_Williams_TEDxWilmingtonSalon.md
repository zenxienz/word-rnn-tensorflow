coaching and coaches there are voice
coaches
soccer coaches even life coaches why not
a financial coach think about the last
time you faced a financial emergency an
unexpected car repair bill a sick child
the loss of a job suddenly just like in
this picture you&#39;re hanging on as hard
as you can to keep from falling into a
financial of this that&#39;s why Whitney and
I are here hold up your hand if you
remember what that feels like I do it&#39;s
pretty scary and stressful perhaps you
had to turn to a family friend or
neighbor to borrow some money
it&#39;d been due your personal savings
account or even take out a loan somehow
you made it work because you had some
financial options but what happens if
you don&#39;t have financial options like
these well that&#39;s why Whitney and I are
here we&#39;re gonna share what&#39;s working
for parents with young children we&#39;re
building their financial grit even in
the face of lots of financial
emergencies who are moving from barely
hanging on to steadily climbing to a
place of financial stability with a
coach a financial coach we all use GPS
right well imagine entering your
directions to your road to success but
then being rerouted down broke Boulevard
setbacks treat depression Drive and
hardship highway and it&#39;s not just you
in the car your three precious babies
are along for the ride would you still
believe that you could arrive at your
destination or would you get frustrated
and turn around instead Walt Disney said
the difference in
and losing is most often not quitting
let me tell you about a remarkable woman
who did not quit miss Diez a single
mother of three young children under the
age of five when we first met her she
was anxious depressed and struggling to
find a job she was on public assistance
she had a very low credit score and
literally no hope of ever buying her own
home but that all changed when she
enrolled in a program that provided her
with a personal financial coach who came
alongside of her and really got to know
her the financial coach came to visit
her in her home and provided her the
support and guidance she needed to turn
those hopes into actionable plans and do
you know what happened I can&#39;t wait to
tell you in just a few moments remember
that concept of financial grit that I
mentioned earlier what&#39;s that all about
think back to what it takes to stick to
a weight-loss plan
learn a new language it&#39;s really grit
that makes a difference and in
particular it&#39;s the three C&#39;s first
capacity to make a plan track your
progress and take action
second confidence to believe in yourself
and know you can do it
and third coaching to train with someone
to build new financial habits it&#39;s that
last seat coaching where the real magic
happens it&#39;s coaching the turns capacity
and confidence into positive financial
action in fact parents with young
children are building their financial
habits and their grit so that they can
build brighter futures for their
children no matter where they live or
what their circumstances as I&#39;ve shared
with Irene I know the importance of
financial grit and the power of coaching
you see at one time in my life I was a
divorced single parent and I put many
miles down on broke Boulevard and
setback Street here I was educated and
employed yet I still struggle
financially for coaching to work
families must make a decision to change
their circumstances change their
situation and that begins with
identifying the why what&#39;s motivating
them to change is it to get out of debt
restore or establish credit purchase a
home establish a budget whatever that
goal is that&#39;s the big motivating factor
but they have to be honest and they must
make the commitment showing up for their
appointments opening the door when their
personal financial coach and home
visitor come to their home and following
through the coaches praise these small
wins every step along the way remember
those three C&#39;s that Irene mentioned
when families participate in the
personal financial coaching program they
then have the capacity to plan and
manage their finances the competence to
know that they can do it and the
coaching support they need to be able to
continue practicing those good financial
habits but how do we really know that
financial coaching is working research
which shows that folks who meet with a
financial coach are it&#39;s both a
promising practice and a powerful
complement to financial literacy
education and counseling in fact a
recent evaluation study which compared
one group of folks who received coaching
to a similar
group who didn&#39;t did find coaching
mattered and made a difference but it
really makes a difference for folks who
met with a coach at least three to four
times even when they make the decision
to participate though it&#39;s still common
for some parents to experience some
speed bumps along the way many families
are very apprehensive about
participating they don&#39;t often want to
confront or expose their personal
financial situation to someone they
don&#39;t know
would you like releasing your personal
information to someone you don&#39;t know
whether or not we asked if you had a
retirement account how much do you have
in your savings what&#39;s your credit score
in order for this coaching model to work
we have to work together and so how do
we overcome that how do we overcome this
relationships relationships
relationships they are the key to
helping families overcome those fears
and to be able to move forward with us
home visitors have an amazing ability to
establish trust to get families to
participate some home visitors have
personal financial coaches themselves so
they can confidently share of the
benefits with their families in addition
to financial coaching there&#39;s another
critical success factor grit in another
TED talk by Angela Duckworth she
described how grit more than IQ was a
more powerful predictor of student
school success that the passion and the
perseverance to achieve your long-term
goals the grit to stick with it
even during the hard times is critical
at the same time we also know that grit
and perseverance aren&#39;t enough that it
takes knowledge support and skills to
turn that grit into action
what about miss Diaz who I first
mentioned talk about grit in less than a
year after working with her personal
financial coach she turned her life
around she got a job she established a
budget and began to save money
her credit score increased tremendously
she then bought a brand new car and was
then pre-approved for a mortgage to buy
a home she made a decision and she was
motivated to do what she needed to do
every time she met with the coach it was
just another reinforcement to continue
to keep her encouraged there&#39;s another
parent we didn&#39;t mention who
demonstrated this financial grid her
name is Miss Van Riper she&#39;s a single
mom of four young children her personal
financial coach educated her on how to
save how to budget and how to clean up
her credit it wasn&#39;t easy but she was
determined and she moved forward with
working on her goals and today her
credit moved from being very poor to
being in very good standing and now
she&#39;s saving to buy her very first car
how else do we know it&#39;s working we
tracked the data and it shows that over
time parents with young children who met
with the coach are increasing their
savings they&#39;re reducing their debt
they&#39;re improving their credit scores
they&#39;re paying their bills on time more
often and they&#39;re building the
confidence to manage their financial
lives that&#39;s how we know it&#39;s working as
I travel the country I look for efforts
that are building brighter futures for
children efforts that are
transformational not just transactional
efforts that change my perspective of
what&#39;s possible I&#39;m inspired not just by
the data in the
search but more importantly by the
stories of the hundreds of parents with
young children parents like Miss Diaz
and miss Van Riper
who are building new financial habits
and the grit to move their families from
the margins to the mainstream so here&#39;s
the big idea we hope you&#39;re inspired to
take up this model of financial coaching
fits into a broader goal to promote
health and wellness in all aspects of
our family&#39;s lives in their finances yes
but also in their emotional and social
well-being we believe that&#39;s what it
takes for them to thrive the programs
that you will hear about today are
positively changing lives and we only
hope that families all across this
country have an opportunity to unlock
their three C&#39;s through financial
coaching and support
you
