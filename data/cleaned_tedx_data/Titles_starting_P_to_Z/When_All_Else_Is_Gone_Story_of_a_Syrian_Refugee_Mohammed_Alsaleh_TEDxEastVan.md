like a sauna the room
was dark
and humid
even the rats
hungry
for
the blood and the human flesh
from all the open wounds
both men
we&#39;re naked
except for their underwear
the old man
had a lot of white
fluffy
a young man
was scared sobbing screaming
pain in his knee was so terrible
we&#39;ll be wincing even as he was crying
the older man leans over and whispered
in Arabic
hang in there son
just going to be a story one day
it was in the story too
we were selling
four years later
the old man
is it
it was tortured and buried
Musgrave
the young man
before you
and this is history
I want you to imagine that where I&#39;m
standing right now is an underground
windowless room
speaker than this carpet
the lights are turned off
everything is
like
as I&#39;m thrown into this room
the prison guard
that is your spot
and slams the door shut
I can&#39;t see my spot
so dark I can&#39;t see anything
rats hissing and chattering men crying
openly some are screaming
others
our breathing heavily
gasping for air
I keep bumping into sweaty human flesh
it is so hot here that even the cement
under my bare foot
is warm
after a while
a tiny crack just the size of a pinhole
opens up in the ceiling
Anna tiny ray of bluish yellow sunshine
crimson
that follow I discover something
incredible
a tiniest ray of light coming into the
darkest room
gradually fold the entire room with life
verse is impossible
darkness can overcome even a speck
of life
come to think of it
that
really is my story
that is
it is
before
take you back to that jail cell in
Damascus Syria
let me first take you through the gates
of the building
words on the gates will forever remain
stuck in my memory
fifteen
squat
those who enter will be missing forever
and those who live
we&#39;ll be reborn again
you already know which of the two things
happened to me
I was reborn I am here
as the light fills the whole room
discover that a space this size was the
jail cell for 30 prisoners and my spot
the place where I shit where I should
sit stand sleep and eat from now on
is smaller than a doormat
there were many days
convinced
missing forever
and my story
we&#39;ll never people
as the wounds of our torturer
open up ugly holes in the naked skin of
the prisoners
we could feel lice and scabies and
bedbugs creep into them
and suck our blood
we had to sleep standing
was no space to lie down
in total
I was arrested and
to prison three times in Syria
altogether I was held in seven different
detention centers in fact on this very
day four years ago I was being
interrogated in one of them
you you you are very lucky
in Canada
there are no terrorists here
for me
yes
that&#39;s what they called me in Syria a
terrorist and that&#39;s why they jailed me
and put me in that jail cell
once somebody calls you a terrorist
you&#39;re in big trouble and in Syria it&#39;s
very very easy to be called a terrorist
all you have to do is oppose the
government and speak out against them
I didn&#39;t even have to speak out
all I did is I took pictures of the
uprising and shared them with the whole
world to see
that
made me a terrorist
I have always been a dreamer
but being a terrorist was not on my
dreams
like many kids
I grew up
dreaming of becoming an astronaut
but when I was in high school I lost the
cousin
when I was in high school I lost
to cancer
I kept asking why couldn&#39;t they cure her
and I kept getting the same answer
cancer
so I
to my dream and made it into a mission
my mission
cancer
that&#39;s how I ended up studying at the
Faculty of Medicine in Homs Syria just
north of Damascus
in 2011
I was a fourth-year medical student
I joined the anti-government protests
cried out for rights change and freedom
the movement swept across the country
and became an uprising
the Assad regime tried to crush the
uprising by chemical weapons gunfire and
genocide I ran away from Assad&#39;s bullets
that day but I didn&#39;t run away from the
uprising in fact the next day I went
back to the streets because I felt now
more than ever that it is my duty to be
part of this revolution
but as you can see
one problem
I&#39;m quite thin and small
I have no weapons or strength to fight
tanks and armies
but I have a brain
and I have a cellphone
and I have determination the photograph
document
expose the atrocities
you
every evening I used to go back to the
University dorms and upload my videos
on social media
so scared and I did that under a fake
name
word
my videos were
in people all across the world
after two years
Fionn animus
the uprising
a final exam for med school suddenly the
bullies stormed into my classroom
they come straight for me
somehow they discover that I
was the one who was leaking those videos
suddenly
I am handcuffed
blindfolded with my own shirt and then
thrown into the back of a military
vehicle
they&#39;re half an hour and many bruises
from the hits that I received in that
vehicle we arrived in a very scary place
ask me
find myself looking at the face of a
scary-looking soldier
of my shirt
biting my hands together and string me
up to a chain coming down from the
ceiling
I was like this hanging like a butcher&#39;s
meat for 72 hours
and then
the real torture started
they wanted me to confess a
close the names of everybody who have
ever helped me to get police videos and
share them with the world
I refuse to obey
started taking out my toenails one by
one
one day
agony
came to an end
it was still
dangers for me to live in Syria
my mother kept telling me that I was
better off away from them than dead
that&#39;s why I had to make
decision
of leaving home and leaving my country
that was in 2013
years ago
also
that was the last time I see my family
since then
my mother and five
refugees themselves
I escaped to Lebanon
and in Lebanon
working in a car wash
there was something about washing cars
that made me think that I was washing
all the wounds and nightmares of Syria
washing cars was
my dream
and so I sought help from the Yuna
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
the UNHCR what else can I do
hope was all I had
hope remained my best friend
a few months later
I received a phone call that changed my
life
brought me here you
a voice on the other end said we heard
your story you might be eligible for
resettlement are you interested
what was I going to say no
and Here I am Here I am in one of the
best countries in the world
my mission has not changed one day I
would still like to become a cancer
specialist and fight and fight and cure
cancer
but first I have work to do
there are many refugees that are
suffering around the world
they have stories to tell too they need
a voice and they need a new home and so
right now I am working full-time in
Vancouver as a refugee counselor right
now my job is to welcome other refugees
to the country and to give them hope
you
we are all humans
with Canadians
our superhumans
you have helped me heal all these deep
wounds that I have my hope right now is
to reunite my family and to bring my
mother and five siblings to Canada here
to safety
right now they are living separately in
harsh conditions across Germany and
Turkey
lucky me I am here
free and with you
whenever
talk to my mom on skype
and I see that she&#39;s starting to give up
hope
be believing that the despair will never
end I remember the old man I met in
prison and tell her
hang in there MA
this is just one chapter of your story
hang in there mom I promise you this is
all going to be a story to tell one day
did the old man believe his own words
I will never know
that was
chapter of his life
but he made me believe
that light
always overcome darkness
they&#39;re in that hellhole a tiny ray of
light gave me hope
and a tiny ray of hope gave me light
that old man&#39;s parting words are my
parting words to you
when all else is gone remember
you still have hope
so never give up hope
especially in humanity hope survives the
worst disease
and remember for every sad Assad rises a
new Gandhi a mother Teresa a Jesus
you
I want to add Muhammad to this list but
you might think that I&#39;m talking about
myself I wasn&#39;t I was just telling you a
story and I hope you found it worth
telling
[Applause]
