every minute of every day of every week
of every month of every year the
equivalent of a garbage truck full of
plastic is entering the ocean and last
year and the year before that and next
year and the year after the continuous
flow of plastic entering the ocean why
should we care
millions of seabirds and sea animals are
dying from the ingestion of plastic we
are experiencing the greatest rate of
extinction in history all occurring in
our lifetime
the irony that I find so relevant is
that out of the history of humanity out
of the history of life on the earth
somewhere around eight point seven
something like that nine million species
existing today we represent only about
0.1% of all of the species that have
ever existed meaning that there&#39;s been
somewhere around 10 billion species that
have existed on the planet and yet we
are the only ones that have the ability
to care for all others just us now it
may not seem like it when you look at
the pictures but we do and that
precisely is the origin of the plastic
bank we are the world&#39;s first
organization to monetize plastic waste
we are a global chain of stores for the
ultra ultra poor where everything in the
store is available to be purchased using
plastic garbage and we offer school
tuition medical insurance communications
power sustainable cooking fuel
high-efficiency stoves sanitation
communication and a whole product range
all available to be purchased using
plastic garbage we&#39;ve created a globally
recognizable and tradable currency that
is waste
now that waste we collect
and we sell to great organizations
around the world ones that want to
exhibit to their customers that they&#39;re
doing everything they can to help not
just clean the earth but to alleviate
poverty inside it a blockchain based
banking application what we&#39;ve really
done is we&#39;ve created candy crush of
recycling an application for the world -
the more that they use it the more they
earn we recognize that one out of every
three children born today will never
have a birth certificate how do you
transcend poverty when you don&#39;t have a
sense of identity and now through the
use of plastic garbage when you increase
your return rate and engage your friends
the more people that you bring into the
system the more they use it the more
that you clean it the better credit
rating we can provide you the more
access to financial tools you can
receive the more reward inside of the
whole system engaging the global north
when our collectors receive certain
levels when they&#39;ve achieved and
collected volumes of material they can
get messages from the north that can be
recognized for their contribution to
society into humanity an ability for the
unseen to be seen a stewardship of all
people in all things
one of the beautiful models that were
just about to execute in Brazil includes
congregations the church where
parishioners are encouraged to not just
bring offering on Sunday but to bring
their recycling with them as well
engaging every community in the service
of creation and the stewardship of the
poor inside of everything what we
instead of everything that we do is a
exponential idea how do we engage the
world how do we share the message and
engage still so much to do and I
recognize that there was so much that we
needed to do this idea this origin that
I had how was I about to engage the
world&#39;s biggest companies how is I going
to engage communities in poverty and
illiteracy and scarcity what would that
look like what would that be
the gift was I embarked I began to take
step by step started to gather the world
around me utilizing technology utilizing
communications utilizing exponential
thought we began and I knew that every
time I took a step every time they
engage someone beside me every time I
moved forward the word would spread the
action would spread
I had a beautiful authentic journey
the gift of becoming the gift of
engaging people the more that I rose the
more that I went forward the more people
would rise beside me our best self
carried forward
this beautiful expression and I learned
that every time I would take a step life
would grow people would rise and I
learned in all of that that the more
that I became the more the world would
change and I recognized in all of it
that I didn&#39;t need to change the world I
just needed to change myself the journey
of the plastic bank thank you
