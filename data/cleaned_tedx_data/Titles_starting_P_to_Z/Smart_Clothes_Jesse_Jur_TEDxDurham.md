I&#39;m very happy to be here today to talk
about smart clothes to start I want to
introduce Jasmine McNeil Jasmine&#39;s over
here on my right and jaslyne made the
dress that she&#39;s wearing and Jasmine&#39;s
actually a recent graduate of the
College of textiles at North Carolina
State University where I&#39;m a research
and I do research on the smart clothes
and one day she came into my office and
she said I want to put my designs into
your with your technology so I want to
put your technology in with my designs
and it was a and the result of that
conversation is the dress that you&#39;re
seeing here today and the dress that you
see here today if you can&#39;t see it in
the back here&#39;s a here&#39;s a quick video
of the dress
it has blinking lights on it and while a
lot of you all have probably seen
dresses with lights or clothes with
lights on it integrated this dress is a
little bit different it&#39;s what we call
smart and this the the reason that we
made this dress is not to necessarily
sell product or try to make a statement
but it was actually to I guess generate
a conversation and this conversation
really starts with a couple of key
questions and those questions are number
one what are the blinking lights and the
blinking lights are actually Jasmine&#39;s
heartbeat so Jazlyn heartbeat is a is is
this these lights are actually
responding to the activation of the
muscles throughout the heart that are
pushing blood throughout an entire body
so you actually if you conglomerate&#39;s
all of the signals from those you
actually get what&#39;s referred to as an
electrocardiogram this is what doctors
use to monitor your heart&#39;s health
the next question is well how do you do
this and we do this through the
integration of sensors that we have in
the shirt that are reading those signals
and then we transport those signals and
we turn on and off LEDs or light
emitting diodes that we have integrated
into the dress
the next question is really the most
important one and this is why I&#39;m an
educator this is though this is the
thing that I&#39;m looking for when I go out
I teach in my classroom or I go out to
public audiences and I talk and that is
well what if you could do this and that
is again the most important question for
me it&#39;s what drives creativity it&#39;s what
sparks innovation and it really is going
to start the conversation about what
we&#39;re gonna have today is if you had
something like this what else could you
do and so let&#39;s first identify a problem
and the problem is heart disease if you
look around the room a lot of y&#39;all are
going to die from heart disease I&#39;m
sorry and in the South we actually have
a really bad problem with this it&#39;s
actually we have we have a higher risk
but yet if I look around the room I
don&#39;t see anyone that&#39;s actually
measuring their heart right now there&#39;s
nobody&#39;s monitoring it the only person
that I can actually tell that&#39;s
monitoring their heart is Jazlyn and
that&#39;s because I can see it but mind you
we don&#39;t want to see everyone&#39;s heart
beat that would be kind of annoying
especially at night so what could we do
to get everyone in here to monitor their
heart in a very effective way in a very
inexpensive way and that&#39;s some of the
questions that we try to ask and answer
within a center that we have at North
Carolina State University called assist
and assist stands for the advanced self
powered systems of integrated sensors
and technologies in really short what
we&#39;re trying to do is we&#39;re trying to
create personal wellness systems so that
you can monitor your own health and be
more interactive with your healthcare
provider and prevent and do preventative
health care so it turns out that
textiles actually plays a very critical
role in this so you can think about
things like you have a Fitbit directly
embedded in within a shirt and the the
shirt actually provides an
interconnected network of devices that
allows you to monitor what everything is
going on inside your body in addition
what happens is is that it&#39;s really it
turns out that it&#39;s really easy to use
in fact it&#39;s as easy as putting on a
shirt I think everyone did that here
today right ok so an example is it is
actually the shirt that I am wearing
today so you can&#39;t see it because it&#39;s
private to me
it&#39;s actually my undershirt of course
are is transporting the data of my heart
health into this tablet this tablet then
sends this data off to SAS data
analytics where they perform analysis on
my heart beat on all the different
muscle activations and they can try to
and they&#39;re trying to decipher all the
different important features of my heart
and they&#39;re trying to relate this back
to me so I can do something to make my
heart healthier and they&#39;re also
relating it back to the health care
provider so that they can inform me when
I when I&#39;m healthy what&#39;s your name
reddits can you hold my heartbeat please
Thanks
ok so it&#39;s really this is really a neat
technology but in almost ability how do
you actually get this into everyone&#39;s
hands and the first thing to do is to
actually go and put yourself into a
doctor&#39;s office scenario typically you
call the doctor and you schedule an
appointment you go the doctor and they
take a very small snapshot of your
health at that moment and then you they
they send you on your way and then you
repeat this process over and over and
over it&#39;s really simple and it&#39;s and
it&#39;s pretty effective but if but it&#39;s is
it really effective enough to really
monitor a health condition that&#39;s so
important such as your heart what we
really want to do is we want to
integrate a wearable technology like the
shirt I&#39;m wearing and we want to give
this to somebody and we will and this
this shirt will actually be made by
somebody what I refer to as a fusion
designer and this somebody that
understands the goals and the challenges
of both the electronics industry the
textiles industry as well as the health
industry somebody like Jasmine and
Jasmine will end up making a shirt for
you that you&#39;ll send you&#39;ll take home it
will transport the data out to the cloud
so somebody like SAS where they do the
data analytics and then they push that
data back
you so you can understand it as well as
to your healthcare provider and they
call you when you need to go and
schedule an appointment this is what we
referred to as a closed-loop health
system and this is really the important
key towards preventive medicine but
that&#39;s that&#39;s how you actually get it
integrated now how do you actually get
it produced and these are the some of
the challenges that I see within the
technology that we study on how we can
improve the ability to put this into
market and the first one the first
challenge is manufacturing and so this
was a recent trip that I took to San
Pedro Sula Honduras where I was I was
able to visit a t-shirt manufacturing
facility in this facility they make four
million t-shirts a month they actually
have it&#39;s it&#39;s really amazing to see the
scale the efficiency and the amount of
volume that is coming out of a facility
like this so as the so in a facility
like this they actually haven&#39;t in the
very last step of the process they they
have a room of 2,500 people where
they&#39;re literally doing their sewing the
individual panels of your shirt together
and then they put a logo or a label on
it and they package it in a box and they
ship it throughout the entire world so
if you want to create a new technology
that can be made into garments you have
to go through a facility like this and
so that&#39;s the technology that we&#39;ve
developed in my lab is is literally
putting the electronics in the logo that
is typically put into a garment so the
logo is made of a material that you&#39;ve
literally iron on and so we are doing
iron-on electronics you can easily
customize this within the within the
garment in a lot of different ways so
for example the shirt I&#39;m wearing but we
can also put other types of devices in
there like this light emitting diode and
we can stretch these garments back and
forth and they&#39;re really durable and we
can and we can wash them just like you
can raw you can regularly wash your
shirt the next big challenge is related
to supply chain and the textile the
textile
a chain and the electronic supply chain
are both global so they&#39;re very similar
in that way but there are volumes their
taxes as you chip from one country to
another country their timelines they&#39;re
all completely different they&#39;re out of
sync and in addition if you want to make
a shirt that&#39;s customizable to you you
don&#39;t want to have to ship it all the
way halfway across the world and then
get it shipped back to you by that time
it&#39;s it&#39;s irrelevant to you so for this
reason it&#39;s really kind of a driving
force for what we refer to as local
manufacturing and this is the this is
something that is coming back to the
United States where you can actually
have all the different components of
your garment made in a close proximity
to where you&#39;re at the next big
challenge is and probably the greatest
challenge is that is the fact that we&#39;re
dealing with two conflicting industries
specifically the in the electronics
industry and the textiles industry the
goals are completely different in fact
the electronics industry they&#39;re just
trying to make the cell phone that&#39;s in
your pocket to be as efficient as
possible and lasts as long as possible
the textiles industry we&#39;ve been around
for a thousands of years trying to make
the shirt that you&#39;re wearing as
comfortable as possible in the in
whatever environment that you want to be
in what the challenge is is is to create
multidisciplinary people that understand
the goals and the challenges of each one
of these communities and its people like
Jazlyn that we&#39;re trying to create and
what what we have around here is a
really kind of a special opportunity we
have places like the College of textiles
we have resources through the
cutting-edge technology that we have in
places like the assist center and that
we have the broad network of people
within the local area around us that can
make the people like Jazlyn that start
the conversation and make us ask what if
you could do this and with that I&#39;d like
to say thank you to Jazlyn and I&#39;d also
like thank you all for coming
