hello everyone I am a you can&#39;t do it
survivor when I was 12 years old I
taught to my English teacher then that I
want to teach English she looked at me
and she said you can&#39;t do it
you have very bad pronunciation long
time after that I was very unsure of
myself and I thought that she was right
it&#39;s amazing how one statement of phrase
done by a person that we respect can
influence our lives luckily I managed to
overcome that insight and pursued my
dream now I teach English and though
that statement said by her was quite
damaging it did some good things as well
now I am self-confident I believe that
what I am doing is my calling so that&#39;s
why I call myself you can&#39;t do it
survivor but not all people managed to
overcome such statements that they heard
in their lives and their true potential
has never been brought out I am a
pedagogists
and if we look at this word pedagogy you
will know that it comes from Greek agro
means I lead by dos means child so if we
join these two words together it means I
lead a child and they love this word
lead in the same sentence children come
to this life with their potential
genetically coded qualities and
abilities which may be developed in
their life and bring potential success
and I believe that educators role is to
help them develop these abilities to
walk down their path we should not
create unnecessary obstacles or share
our judgments with them on the contrary
we should help them we should support
them we should teach them to learn from
their victories and mistakes make them
understand that their hard work
we&#39;ll definitely bring them where they
belong now how can we educators help
them to unlock potential I have three
rules that I use in my work first of all
I become their greatest fan I am the
greatest fan of my students fans are
people who are enthusiastically devoted
to someone or something
they&#39;re called supporters they notice
little details of the object of their
fandom and they support passionately and
care with all their hearts fans presence
at sports arenas enhances sportsmen
performance you know that sports demand
a lot from players both physically and
mentally
they are competing they are competing
not only against their rivals they are
competing against themselves performing
under pressure is usually difficult for
everyone but support of thousands of
fans in the arena makes a big difference
fans have no effect on sportsmen
physical ability but they can build
sportsmen psyche and they can enhance
their concentration what about as
educators how can we become the best
fans of our students there are some
viral videos on youtubes
on YouTube about such teachers too they
illustrate how they build bonds with
their students on one video you can see
a secondary school teacher who greets
their his students every day before they
enter the classroom and he created a
special great greeting for every of the
students on the other video you can see
a special education teacher who invites
in the morning every kid and tells them
how wonderful they are what qualities he
sees in them he appreciates what they do
or achieve in the class
so both these teachers show students
that
they see and appreciate them which in
turn in turn boosts their feeling of
acceptance and self-confidence and later
enhances their learning results I also
try to show my students that I am their
biggest fan I show that I care and if I
notice that my student has let&#39;s say
favorite pet I will remember the name of
this pet and after two three days out of
the blue I will ask how is your dog
breed doing if they play some sports and
they go on copy competition next day for
sure I will ask them how did it go and
if they won I will say well done if they
lost I will say don&#39;t worry you will
make it next time these little questions
and remarks show kids that I care that
things which I important to them are
also important to me and they really are
they feel this care and we establish
special bonds which send the signals to
them that they are appreciated and that
I am accompanying them on their way in
the academic setting I observe on areas
where my students are good at and I
always give them feedback about that and
also I try to see at least three top
three areas of difficulties and then I
try to help them understand where their
problem is and then after some time
let&#39;s say when they write an essay and
don&#39;t make that mistake I will always
comment about that I highlight on their
progress I teach students to see how
they improve and grow I twist an angle
from mistakes being negative to mistakes
being positive and even inspiring
inspiring to progress inspiring to move
forward inspiring to go beyond limits
and like a real fan I am always there
there by their side
number two what I do I see my students
big to illustrate the magic of seeing
something as big I will show you a
little experiment with my dog Mars he&#39;s
really small his body weight is about
2.2 kilograms and if we speak about his
brain I am Not sure but it should be
about 58 60 grams look what happens to
Mars when my husband tells him that he&#39;s
a big dangerous dog you will see their
great boost in his self-confidence and
he really believes that he&#39;s a German
Shepherd look at his posture look at his
eyes
these figures dump all my target only aw
oh good boy good for absorbing all big
bomb - kill the dog German Shepherd
boxer everything your good boy Oh
big dog Mars behaves like this only when
he is encouraged by my husband so my
husband sees him as a German Shepherd
Mars behaves like a German Shepherd he
behaves like this only when he is
encouraged and I believe that this magic
works on humans too
child&#39;s brain by the age 5 is very close
to the size of adult and two-volume as
well and weighs about 1.2 kilograms
which is 20 brains of my dog imagine the
power of any word which we say to kids
in a twenty times bigger brain if you
say to a student you cannot that it&#39;s
not for you what will you do if you fail
that escalates in their brain and does
not make them anything better that makes
them smaller I started sailing last
summer and if you want to go from point
A which is in the West to point B which
is in the East and you have a crosswind
coming from the north
you never head to the point B you had
somewhere above because you will drift
and you will end up at point B if you
head to point B you will end up below
the same works when we look at the man
we should see our students much bigger
as they are or even as they could be if
we take an individual as he is we make
him smaller but if we take the man as he
should be
we make him capable of becoming what he
can be and that was not said by me that
was said by Goethe two centuries ago
by Victor Franco who repeated that fifty
years ago
Franco said that we have to be
idealistic and over estimating and over
rating the man looking at him from high
above and then we promote him to what he
can really be so when we are idealistic
we will end up at being realistic so
this gives a chance to an individual to
unlock the potential in my work I
sometimes get students who have really
low self-esteem and they do not believe
that could they could ever pass any
examination and so on and we work with
them to make them big again let&#39;s say
they have some goal they want to pass
IELTS examination which is English
language testing examination at a
certain score this is the first thing
what we discover is their goal what they
want to have and when they want to have
let&#39;s say they want to have 6.5 score in
five months
great next thing with what we do we
assess the level and let&#39;s say the level
is five point zero five point five so we
then understand what is the gap between
what the student knows and where the
student wants to be and we assess this
gap and let&#39;s say to jump from five
point five to six point five the student
needs to learn about two and a half
thousand words and do at least two three
practice tests per day so I give the
study plan to a student that you have to
learn seventeen eighteen words daily and
in five months you will be there where
you want to be and a student starts to
see that I see them big I see that they
can achieve this result I believe that
they can and they start to believe that
they can this becomes a very strong
motivation they are free there are no
limits they know the goal they they know
how to approach it and
responsibilities in their hands and that
really empowers students they feel in
control of their lives
and many of them achieve everything that
they have planned but the most important
miracle which happens is that they start
to believe that they can and I always
tell students if you believe that you
cannot you&#39;re right if you believe that
you can you&#39;re right too and
understanding of these live truth takes
them beyond their limits and the last
thing that I want to tell you and share
with you is that I try to scare my
students fears off fears we all have
myriad of mental and emotional concerns
that influence our choices in life and
our behavior we do things we&#39;re
comfortable with and avoid doing certain
things just because we are afraid of and
I have seen many brilliant people who do
not do what they meant to do just
because they are afraid I believe that
our greatest personal development lies
in the direction of our biggest fears by
letting go one fear we open doors for
new opportunities which bring us to
places we never thought we might be
because of my fear of water and depth I
learned to swim only five years ago
but already one year ago I became a
certified open water diver so overcoming
one fear opened an amazing underwater
world for me with picturesque sites
colorful plants and fishes one an
important fear of water heed such
beauties from me the majority of
students have fears and you will be
surprised that if you ask them do you
really will answer and I made a small
research a survey and surprisingly many
of them have very typical fears primary
school pupils are afraid to be laughed
at teenagers are afraid to be rejected
and if and
also to fail University students are
afraid of unknown so basically all their
fears fall either to someone&#39;s
disapproval or failure so if I hear from
my student that they are afraid I always
take time to speak about their fears and
tell them that the fears are like little
monsters which exist only in our heads
and they take our energy we think of
these monsters we listen to them we
follow to their advice we change our
life according to their them isn&#39;t that
ridiculous I disagree with that I want
to manage my life myself so take time
with your students to speak about fears
because fears don&#39;t really exist if we
let them go and I really wish you to
unlock your own potentials and
potentials of your students thank you
