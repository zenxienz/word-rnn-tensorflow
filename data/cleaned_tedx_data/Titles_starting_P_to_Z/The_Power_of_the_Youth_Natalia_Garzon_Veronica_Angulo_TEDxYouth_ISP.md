hello everybody hi I&#39;m Veronica and my
name is Nathaniel and today before I
start talking I want to tell you a
little bit about rice rice is a club
that I founded along with one of my
friends two years ago we have a series
of programs in a public school here so
we teach the fourth graders values the
sixth graders English classes the ninth
graders organization and study skills
and we&#39;re currently restoring a public
library in our school we&#39;re also running
a program called Wright&#39;s middle school
where we teach sixth graders the
importance of empowerment and
self-esteem
but to us Rises much more than these
programs that we run because rise did
not start like this
Brice started a little bit more like
this I was on my way to a public school
somewhere in Panama with an educational
curriculum I had to sign with my friends
I was about to pitch him the idea to the
principal of the school and I was
confident that she welcomed my proposal
hello nice to meet you my name is
Veronica we spoke on the phone the other
day about my organization rice yeah here
I brought up okay and out like with all
the courses will willing to offer we can
look over them if you want who would be
teaching these classes we would we have
a club of teacher we are in charge of
the program how old are you we&#39;re all 16
oh yeah well we&#39;ll call you back okay
okay thank you this was sometimes the
reaction we received in multiple public
schools around Panama where we were
ready to launch our program rice kids
sometimes when adults see us and they
know our age they think about all the
things we can&#39;t do 16 years old can vote

can&#39;t drive past 9:00 p.m. and don&#39;t
even have fully developed frontal lobes
with all these preconceived ideas of
what we couldn&#39;t do it was impossible
for adults to see us as potential
part-time teachers our vision was to
launch a program where we could teach
classes to younger kids a values class
and an English class but before we could
turn our vision into a reality
we had to sell it to the public school
principals we were young girls who were
trying to teach even younger boys and
girls but we had the idea and the
determination to start we simply needed
more people to believe that we could
after a lot of rejection from
we finally found someone that believed
in us and we started teaching classes at
instituto nacional de la merced in
interview
becoming full-time students and
part-time teachers at the same time did
not come easy to us
our success story it was not spontaneous
or in mediate in fact our success story
has a series of challenges trailing
behind before we became teachers we had
to learn how to become effective
entrepreneurs and even before that we
had to learn how to become effective
leaders getting to where we are has been
the longest journey of our very short
lives and today we&#39;re here because we
want to share with all of you the three
lessons that we&#39;ve learned on our road
to becoming leaders entrepreneurs and
teachers at the age of 16 the first
lesson we want to share with you tonight
is that abstract ideas can become
concrete every day of the week we face
small challenges technical difficulties
regarding our programs a normal Tuesday
night for us will go a little like this
hello
nutty hello we have a huge problem what
the bus driver virtually you&#39;re just
cancelled and I don&#39;t know what to do
okay okay okay let&#39;s calm down we got
this okay
oh god okay you post on the Facebook
group see if anybody has any bus driver
contact and I&#39;ll try to look for
something too okay okay thank you thank
you I&#39;ll call you back I&#39;m panicking
okay bye
okay okay as you can see our problems
now are much more concrete than they
were before because before our problems
went a little more like this nutty I
can&#39;t stop thinking about the girl
effect video we saw yesterday
hey I&#39;ve been replaying it ever since
you said it&#39;s me okay you know what I
think this might be a little crazy but I
think we should start something here in
Panama what if we start with a club at
school yeah but no one has started
across the school what how did that work
you know what you have an idea and a
million questions come to mind this is
exactly how we felt it was also a
problem because we were facing changes
for the first time like talking to the
out theories of our community leading
meetings or even approaching someone
there was older than us it was also hard
because as human beings were obsessed
with the physicality of the world we
like problem-solving when there when
there are as easy as making a phone call
or sending a ticket
for a fundraiser for this reason when we
are faced with problems that seem bigger
than ourselves we tend to wait we tend
to back away from them
we know how hard it is to face questions
like what are we doing or what&#39;s your
next step be and sometimes we might be
left with that thought that maybe we
shouldn&#39;t do this at all or this is just
too complicated for us but despite the
presence of doubt if you have an idea
and you believe in it there&#39;s only one
important step you have to do start
before everybody starts panicking
we know starting is hard but we also
know how easy it becomes once you do
starting does not necessarily mean you
have your logo three fundraisers and
everything plan know starting can be as
simple as finding an inspiring video and
sharing it with the people around you
starting is basically taking your big
problem and solving a tiny fraction of
it there is a common concept in
entrepreneurship labeled Minimum Viable
products I know this term sounds
complicated but still easy to understand
this basically is an analogy that
compares your project&#39;s final vision to
the construction of a car although you
eventually want to end up constructing a
Ferrari you might as well start small
for example a scooters because no matter
how small or slow or primitive the
scooter is it is still a mode of
transportation and it will still allow
you to get to places as you reach your
ideal of constructing a car on the other
hand if you start with a Ferrari right
away you&#39;re gonna end up with one tire
or one engine only which are items that
need the assistance of other items in
order for them to be useful many times
durability with rice we struggle with
the idea of starting simply because we
wanted to start with our Ferrari we
envision what a rice kit would look like
every day of our lives would be a kid
with his rice backpack his rice shirt
his writes notebook his pencil case and
an undeniable desire to learn the
problem was we didn&#39;t have backpacks we
didn&#39;t have no books we didn&#39;t have
shirts but most importantly we didn&#39;t
have kids to turn into rice kids so what
do we do we decided to start small for
us a minute opening pilot classes in a
public school here in Panama
you it can mean a variety of things
opportunities are never limited and
there&#39;s always someone that is willing
to help but most importantly there&#39;s
always someone that needs help you
should always ask yourself questions
like what do I need to accomplish or why
do I need to accomplish this but you
should never ask yourself questions like
am I the one that needs to get started
because the answer is always yes the
second lesson we want to share with you
is that the team is more important than
the idea because both teams and ideas
change constantly this is the hardest
lesson to keep in mind but it&#39;s also
essential the first fact you need to
know once you become an entrepreneur is
that it is okay to change your idea and
almost always you&#39;ll change your idea at
least once and I know changes are scary
especially when they evolve something
you really care about something you
wanna see succeed as young leaders we
had nothing to fall back on we are no
safety torturers we had a plan B luckily
we had a strong team and we faced
questions and all these times we didn&#39;t
know how to answer the questions we
stick together as a team one leader can
truly start a spark a domino effect but
a group of leaders can truly start a
revolution working together was dosed
with those that share your same passion
is rewarding and you will contribute to
the effectiveness of your project but
this team needs to be as cohesive as
possible and how do you achieve this
cohesiveness with two important
components communication and patience
let&#39;s start with communication
communicating with your team is
important because you need to know your
team in order for it to be effective as
the word indicates the team is composed
of many individuals and we found out
that no two individuals are alike
everybody has a different personality
and thus everybody deserves a different
approach even the tone and the wording
of your directions as the leader needs
to vary and understanding what works
with each member will allow your team to
be effective communicating is important
and it must be done frequently if it
takes weekly to do this via Skype email
Facebook whatever you want do it as long
as you take the time to know your team
your team will take the time to work
through all the changes that your
organization
and now patience we know that sometimes
your group seems to be in absolute chaos
but please never give up on any of the
members they&#39;re there because they truly
care about the organization and any
challenges that you confront you need to
face them right away the patient for
results but stand by your team at all
times because not everybody works at the
same pace and not everybody works the
same way but everybody is working
towards the same goal and that&#39;s what
matters the third and last lesson we
want to share is that passion will keep
you going all the other lessons are
really important but this one is truly
the reason why we&#39;re standing here in
front of you today
Torino the definition of passion would
be wrong because passion is different
for every single one of us here today
and even to us both we&#39;re members of the
same organization passion passion taste
from very different forms to me passion
is Drive passion is feeling overwhelmed
because I have too many ideas in my head
passion is constantly searching best
fundraising activities or look into it
for ways to improve your project all the
time passion is what makes hard work
seemed easy and to me passion is having
a headache after a long day but still
running up the five flights of stairs to
get to room six in and to real passion

is 1:00 a.m. Skype calls trying to get
the lesson plan ready passion is mom I
can&#39;t go out I need to finish my rice
curriculum or I&#39;ll eat lunch later agree
we have to get to this meeting passion
comes in small moments it is not defined
by grandiose moments that are clear
thank yous for everything you do
on the contrary passion comes in moments
that perhaps only lasts a couple of
seconds one day I was in class starting
a lesson
when all of a sudden Alexandra the class
clown jumped out of a chair and started
making jokes when this usually happens
it takes about five minutes for me to
calm them down and continue but this
time it was a little different out of
the corner of my eye I saw Hennessey&#39;s
raise her hand
soon after even a Carlos and all the
others followed in less than a minute
the class was completely quiet and even
Alessandra sat back down I had showed
him this method of bringing it back
during our first
a school and now seeing them applied
without me having to lead it came with a
satisfaction I cannot explain a couple
of weeks ago as I was teaching my sixth
grade English classes we were going over
an activity to review what we had
learned during the week which was
feeling so the activity went something
like this I would say sad they have to
act sad or angry excited and they would
do that but what happens is it that day
they had misbehaved in the moment I
walked into the door they were screaming
they were laughing they were yelling
they were not listening to me and I was
exhausted when I read out the word loved
I expected all my students to smile or
signaled hearts with their hand or
something but instead they all started
to stand up one by one and they ran
towards me and they buried me in a
massive hug if I sit there with 25
children surrounding me and hugging me
it seemed like everything that had
happened that day them screaming
laughing not paying attention to me that
didn&#39;t matter and I realized that I
could never be mad at my students
experiencing moments like this is what
makes us value what we do every day of
our lives as you can see it takes one
kid one smile one hug or head raise
hands to energize it to keep going they
keep fighting for what we want envision
abstractly but to never give up despite
the many struggles that were forced to
face on a daily basis becoming teachers
entrepreneurs and leaders has been our
greatest accomplishment in our 18 years
of life we started out as 16 years old
who were disregarded for being too young
who had no idea what a curriculum looked
like and who thought their ideas were
too big and those too impossible now we
have taught others that age is just a
number we can design curriculums under
two hours and our most successful
project started out as bold and abstract
ideas this process has also helped us
become better human beings because with
every lesson we teach on the value of
respect we learn to respect those around
us and with every lesson we teach on the
importance of education we learn to
appreciate what we have it is important
that you remember that passion can be
found at a young age and despite stigmas
like you are too young to find what you
love or this is just a phase
it&#39;s never too early to start so find
what you love and you will find your
purpose find what others need and use
your passion to assist those who need it
start small and be patient but be
resilient and always remember that what
keeps you going is your passion we don&#39;t
want anybody in this crowd to ever feel
insignificant because of their age
on the contrary assert your own
authority and show others that you
should be valued by your work your ideas
and your will to make them happen not by
the year you were born in or by the
grade you are currently in so start now
and never ever underestimate the power
that we as young emerging leaders have
and if at times those around you start
to doubt your potential to change the
world we want all of you to ask them the
following question how can we the youth
of today and the adults of tomorrow
create an effective future if we don&#39;t
have a voice in the present thank you
[Applause]
