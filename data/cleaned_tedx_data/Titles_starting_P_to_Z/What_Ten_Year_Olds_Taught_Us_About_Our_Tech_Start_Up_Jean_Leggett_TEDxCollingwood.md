your software sucks
this thing&#39;s buggy don&#39;t you have
spellcheck out of the mouths of babes
you know they say there are three things
that will tell you the the truth drunk
people children and yoga pants so I&#39;m a
stand-up comedian and I also have an
English degree which occasionally means
that I spout off romantic snarky haiku
and I&#39;m also known to recite the body
parts of The Canterbury Tales but five
years ago I found myself in an unusual
journey in entrepreneurship you see my
husband had nearly died from a medical
error while we were living in Dallas
Texas and we thought what better time to
return to our hometown where we hadn&#39;t
lived in 20 years and we don&#39;t know
anybody other than mom and dad to start
something to start something risky and
daring and not worry about life sounds
like a really easy journey right a
straight path to success instead it kind
of looks like that a bit of a winding
mountain sometimes their son sometimes
there&#39;s rain so we set off to create
software for writers to take short
stories and novels and create narrative
based video games you know for word
nerds are you a word nerd I&#39;m a word
nerd I like haiku come on so what was
interesting through that journey is we
decided we were gonna work with children
now I have to tell you something I&#39;m 40
no pets no plants no children if it
can&#39;t feed itself I can&#39;t live in my
house
hobbies okay because he&#39;s learned how to
work the microwave and he&#39;s great at
takeout so what were we thinking to take
on kids and teach them we don&#39;t have a
background as teachers he&#39;s a software
engineer and I&#39;m a stand-up comic why
would you trust your children to us
honestly so that very first summer in
2015 we had four children parents who
knew us and trusted us and figured hey
we couldn&#39;t lose their children if they
were in a confined space for a week we
had two boys and two girls now I have to
say the two girls that made me super
happy because there are less than 15% of
women in video game development so hey
we were looking at a 50/50 ratio in our
first week that&#39;s kind of cool
Rachel number one wanted to create a
Minecraft Maze Runner
you know minecraft all the rage with the
kids these days Rachel number two she
wanted to make a murder mystery with
classic Star Trek characters who killed
the Klingon ah that was so awesome
in that first week we saw all of the
bugs with our software did you know that
we hadn&#39;t prepared for more than one
person to play a game one of our kids
was named Spencer tester and boy did he
ever test he tested the software and my
patience but he was really fantastic and
we learned so much in that first week in
that second year we had made all of
these improvements to the software and
we started to teach more children now
the thing is with linear storytelling
we&#39;re all used to reading a book from
page one all the way to the end unless
you&#39;re one of those weird people that
just goes right to the end because you
want to know who done it we were
teaching children how to be diverse
thinkers and creating nonlinear
narratives this is actually a picture of
one of the games created by a child she
was 12 years old and in her name is
Zahra she created a mystery set in a
castle setting now have to say the girls
tended to create games that were
friendlier and the boys more conflict
based which I thought was a very
interesting observation
but in that second year the kids were
able to play all of the games created by
the kids and student in year 1 you see
year 1 their benchmark was an hour long
game that our professional designers had
created so they had no idea that they
thought they could create a 1 hour game
in 20 hours of class but by the second
year they were able to benchmark
themselves against other 11 12 and 13
year old kids I can do that I can do
that better so we were starting to see
really cool things like voice overs and
customization and stories that really
blew our minds now here&#39;s the remarkable
thing there is incredible joy on a
child&#39;s face when they become engaged
with what it is that they&#39;re creating
right now there&#39;s a huge push in the
education system for stem science
technology engineering and math I feel
like we&#39;ve missed a really important
piece of that a for the Arts steam what
we were seeing was that children were so
engaged in the act of storytelling and
printing in that code they actually have
to learn Lua script because all of that
stuff they have to have the logic built
in for that game to work that is the
exact look on the face of a 13 year old
girl named Maddie who coated for the
first time and the tutorial box popped
up and there was us it was amazing and
then all of the other kids came to her
for help with how to code we later would
see that again with an eight-year-old I
know no pets no plants no children what
am I doing with your children earlier
this year we were asked by Microsoft to
come out to Vancouver and teach their
employees children how to make games
except these children were going to be
between the ages of 8 and 12 and in fact
they snuck a seven and a half year old
in there I guess she was tall for her
age that was an interesting experience
so instead of having solo projects for
each child we had to think about what
would the outcome going to be you know
as adults we&#39;ve become very
outcome oriented so my idea was that
these children were coming for one week
and they would have a game and then they
would go home on Friday well this was
gonna be a little bit different we had
two groups of five girls
I took the younger ones Blair took the
older ones his team team shadow created
an inverse world of the Disney stories
where the bad guys won I thought that
was kind of cool they&#39;re all girls but
they wanted like the deep gory stuff and
my adorable children wanted to create
the adventures of Finn and GAC&#39;s they
were going to go on a picnic in the
woods and meet super monkey super kitty
and Julio the big bad wolf and at the
end of the game there was going to be
three swirling portals and you could
choose what happy ending that you were
going to have now in entrepreneurship
you are going to experience highs and
lows and some surprises so imagine my
surprise when my seven and a half year
old in the group says I want to jump
scare in the game a jump scare and she
proceeds to draw what I can only
describe as a disturbing bloody doll
and then the other girls say I want to
have a doll in there too and then the
other and then the other and then the
other so now I have five creepy looking
dolls and they&#39;re like Jean can you pick
the best one
my goodness so we put them all in if you
pick the yellow portal that is where
you&#39;re going to have the creepy dolls
that your children drew I did not
encourage this this is your children
however I may have been strategic in
placing the creepy renditions for added
effects now I will tell you they were
audible gasps when I showed them this
because those children we assume that
girls aren&#39;t into horror but
surprisingly they were really into
horror you know we want to lump them
into unicorns and fairies and princesses
know they these are actually the tamer
ones these are the tamer ones but these
are the surprises that we had not
anticipated as educators that these kids
were gonna be like really into creepy
stuff I thought that was kind of cool it
surprised me how engaged they were their
parents of the eight year old said you
know my kid goes to camp for one day and
she&#39;s bored but you got them engaged for
five days and it&#39;s not a magic of who we
are as educators it&#39;s a magic of that
engagement because now you have that
child who&#39;s really excited to see this
thing come to life it&#39;s their story it&#39;s
their words and it&#39;s their magic you
know at the end of each camp we sit down
each of our kids and we say so what did
you think would you do it again and what
they all say is it was harder than
anything I&#39;d ever done in school and it
kind of was scary looking on the Monday
right just like anything else in life
when you get started it&#39;s scary if you
had asked me four years ago to run a
tech startup and go through months of
lean times would I have done it years of
lean times even I don&#39;t know it&#39;s scary
and it&#39;s the unknown but these kids
prove to us that if you work hard
there&#39;s something really valuable that&#39;s
going to come at the end of it and so
their advice to the incoming students
was it looks scary but it&#39;s not and it&#39;s
really kind of cool we also learned that
there is magic and helping people see
what&#39;s possible when you&#39;re in a
traditional classroom environment and
you have one teacher for twenty eight to
thirty students they don&#39;t get that
connection with you and they want to be
connected the other thing is I as a very
business minded person providing this
service
was completely oblivious to the fact
that they wanted to make friends with
each other I know right they actually
liked each other oh that&#39;s an
interesting thing because it was very
adult very adult I read something online
that says that at five years old we use
80% of our creativity and by the time we
reach 12 it&#39;s 2% and that it stays at 2%
for the rest of our lives now I read
this and I thought that can&#39;t be true
that cannot be true I looked for proof
to refute it something to prove it and I
couldn&#39;t I just found somebody repeating
the same thing over and over again
because you know it&#39;s the Internet but
deep down inside I have to wonder if
it&#39;s true because I don&#39;t see a lot of
adults engaging in creativity and when
we are in creativity we are in joy when
is the last time that you were fully
creative you know we have our knitting
bombers like we&#39;re yeah knit and you
throw it on a tree that&#39;s kind of
creative maybe you&#39;re really into fancy
artisanal cheeses well if you&#39;re making
them that&#39;s creative but from their
day-to-day lives we are so caught up in
our mortgages and our relationships and
our jobs and all of that stress that we
have forgotten to have joy and
creativity and working with those kids
reminded me of how lacking in creativity
that the stand-up comedian was until I
started creating my own games and I see
that in other adult writers they want to
create too because everybody has a story
what I realized was that we weren&#39;t just
building a technology company we were
building a dream we were building a
story machine and we each have stories
to tell
what&#39;s yours
