no matter where they live what school
they go to or what grade they&#39;re in
every student gets into the typical
school routine they go to school go to
their different classes have hour-long
lectures go home do some homework and
then get up the next morning and do it
all over again
now they do this for about two to four
weeks depending on the subject and the
length of the unit and then they take a
test and all the material that&#39;s been
covered let&#39;s say that a hypothetical
kid at one of these hypothetical schools
gets a ninety on their test that&#39;s
pretty good they got an a their parents
are happy their friends are jealous and
the kid is happy for about one day until
the next unit begins and the whole cycle
starts over again but for the few kids
at the top of an arbitrary list that 90
is the beginning of an end that 90 drops
there great enough that they work
themselves to the bone the next unit to
get that elusive 100 to bring their
grade back up this is the world that we
live in this is the vicious cycle that
keeps kids up late into the night
studying hard for a grade that won&#39;t
change much this is the cycle that holds
kids back from doing something that they
love or even taking one regular class
because it&#39;ll drop their GPA and then
they won&#39;t get into a good enough
college and then their entire future
will fall apart and everything will be a
downward spiral of fast food meals and
long hours and three jobs just to pay
for a crappy apartment on the wrong side
of town right doesn&#39;t getting a ninety
on a test ruin a kid&#39;s entire future no
it doesn&#39;t but the school systems that
we employ today costumes to believe that
to believe that everything they do is
all for the perfect life that their
parents dreamed it out for them but
these systems
actually caused everything to fall apart
the problem with schools nowadays isn&#39;t
the teaching or the lack of funding it
all comes down to two simple concepts
GPA and class rank GPA or grade point
average is a completely arbitrary system
meant to calculate a student&#39;s academic
worth but really has little to do with
the students actual measure of knowledge
and intelligence and more to do with
self-determination perseverance and
knowledge of how to work the system a
study done by Angela L Duckworth and
Martin EP Seligman in 2005 found that
the correlation between GPA and
self-discipline was 67% more than twice
the amount of correlation between GPA
and intelligence which was about 32% not
only that but the part of the brain
associated with self discipline doesn&#39;t
even fully develop until around the age
of 25 so not only does GPA not represent
true academic achievement it actually
reflects the skill that students can&#39;t
even fully master for another decade and
it doesn&#39;t even represent that as long
as you know how to work the system when
my older sister went through high school
she took creative writing and theater
because she wanted to and because she
was interested in those things she
graduated 10th in her class of around
540 and yet she did blame and still
blames my parents were allowing her to
take classes without the extra bump
points that would have increased her GPA
by the time I got to high school my
older siblings had already planned
everything out for me I&#39;ve known what
classes I would be taking in high school
since I was 11
even before middle school because what a
high GPA really means is maximizing the
amount of AP pre AP and honors classes
that you take not how well you do in
them now I was really shocked when I
learned that some of my really smart
friends were taking regular classes
because they didn&#39;t want to have to deal
with the enormous amounts of work that
rigorous classes assign I was shocked
because how
two older siblings I know that to even
have a shot at valedictorian regular
classes were out of the question
and anyone who knows this can easily
find ways to cheat the system for
instance taking easier AP classes for
the bump points and not taking classes
that seem fun or interesting or that
you&#39;re passionate about because those
classes don&#39;t help your GPA in fact the
entire system of ranking kids based on
GPA is a toxic system that pits kids
against one another and turns academics
into a noxious competitive sport that
changes how kids view the concept of
academic integrity because of class rank
students who care enough to let
themselves fall into the vicious cult of
GPA will do anything to get a leg up on
the person ahead of them the importance
of academic integrity falls far below
the importance of getting the right
grade the right rank the perfect GPA in
the past the students who cheated their
way through high school were the ones
who are struggling to get by nowadays
the stigma of cheating has fallen
drastically as more and more top
students use cheating as a way to get
the slightest increase in GPA in the
1940s about 20% of college students
admitted to cheating in high school
in modern times between 75 and 98
percent of college students each year
admitted to cheating in high school
studies have shown that the main reason
for cheating is because of the intense
pressure to get a good grade cheating
can even begin as early as preschool
when kids break rules to win competitive
games academic cheating usually sets in
around middle school according to a
recent study of middle schoolers
two-thirds admitted to cheating on exams
while 9/10 admitted to copying someone
else&#39;s homework in 1998 80% of the
country&#39;s top student
admitted to cheating to get to the top
of their class and more than half of
them reported that they didn&#39;t even
think cheating was that big of a deal
kids feel the pressure to get better
grades in order to cinch that extra
hundredth of a GPA point or to move up
one place in their class rank this
unhealthy system destroys the morals and
integrity of kids in schools across the
country now besides that there&#39;s a much
bigger problem with the practice of
ranking kids against one another every
teacher principal board member or anyone
else in any way related to the education
of children has to ask themselves a
simple question is the purpose of school
to develop or select the talent of
children class rank is a system that
falls neatly under the select talent
category it chooses the student that is
the best of the best
typically by only a fraction of a GPA
point now the best way to maximize
differences between students is by poor
teaching now it seems crazy well in
order to rank kids based on a point
system you have to be able to find
enough differences in the points to
declare a winner and the best way to
maximize the differences is by teaching
kids as poorly as possible because if
kids aren&#39;t taught much and what they
are taught is vague and incomplete and
meaningless most kids won&#39;t learn most
kids need the guidance of a teacher to
help them fulfill their potential a few
kids are either intelligent enough or
hard-working enough to not really need a
teacher for those kids a teacher is like
a decorative lamp it has its uses but
most of the time it&#39;s kind of just there
for those kids
they don&#39;t need a teacher they kept by
on their own natural talent anyway so
the skill if the teacher doesn&#39;t matter
but those kids are a fraction of the
entire student population what it really
turns into is giving five or six kids a
leg up to get into the best colleges and
giving the rest of the kids a terrible
education and even those five or six
kids would benefit from better teaching
so if the purpose of school is to select
talent then by all means keep glass rank
continuous system that pits a small
bunch of equally intelligent kids
against each other and gives the rest of
the kids a terrible education but if you
decide that the purpose of school is to
develop talent then do that take the
time to teach every kid the way they
need to be taught
give every kid the understanding that
they deserve the purpose of education is
to teach not turn academics into a
bidding war for colleges so let&#39;s do
that let&#39;s turn our backs on the
arbitrary systems of selecting talent
and instead use our skills to develop
talent because being human means
deserving of a full education thank you
