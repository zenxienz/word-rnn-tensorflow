it&#39;s no exaggeration to say that the
automobile has revolutionized our
society I drove here this morning from
Washington DC and imagine many of you
drove here from other places and as we
drove we traveled over a landscape
that&#39;s been transformed by the
automobile it&#39;s changed our cities or
towns and our rural areas it&#39;s affected
our industries and jobs creating new
jobs and new industries and things like
gas stations and auto repair and
batteries and car insurance and it&#39;s
shaped our culture the automobile is a
literal vehicle for the American values
of freedom and self-expression but
looking back over a little on 200 years
ago when the automobile first came on to
the scene no one not even the people in
the industry could foresee what changes
were down the road so back in around
1900 the predecessor of the German car
company company de mer commissioned a
survey to look at what they thought
could be an estimate of worldwide demand
for automobiles and they figured that
they came up with was that there will be
about 1 million cars sold worldwide now
why did they come up with this figure
what was because they estimated that
there were only about 1 million people
available to be trained as chauffeurs so
think of it about a hundred years ago
car companies didn&#39;t think we&#39;d drive
our own cars and coming up pretty soon
they may be right so earlier this year I
got the opportunity to have my first
ride in an autonomous vehicle it was
very exciting for me to see the
technology but one of the things that it
brought to mind was the experience of my
mother Hannah who in her entire life has
had a serious vision problem and has
never been able to drive so she always
had to have someone else drive her to
the store or to see friends or to see
family and I thought about how this
autonomous vehicle could revolutionize
the lives of other disabled people and
allowed them more measure of
Independence and autonomy now there are
other great promises of societal benefit
from these vehicles first thing that it
could do is save us time or give us back
make the sum of our time more useful so
think about finishing that last minute
project on your way to the office or
taking a nap
on your drive home after a hard day at
work or other things like watching
videos with your family on the long
drive to Grandma&#39;s house now some of the
other benefits might be a larger scale
for society
things like decreased pollution
increased energy savings and better land
use for reductions in parking spaces and
then of course one of the most important
benefits could be in terms of saving
lives so there&#39;s the estimate is that
there are about 37 a little over 37
thousand deaths last year in the u.s.
from automobile accidents an autonomous
vehicles have the potential to greatly
reduce that but as I rode in that
autonomous vehicle I also realized that
consumers might well have privacy and
security concerns and the data bears
that out so there was a couple surveys
recently one surveyed consumers asking
them if they&#39;d ever ride in a fully
autonomous vehicle and about 55 percent
of consumers said no that they wouldn&#39;t
they were worried about the technology
and its reliability and safety another
survey asked 55 asked consumers if they
would buy a fully autonomous vehicle and
about the same percentage 55 percent
said no they would never buy a fully
autonomous vehicle they just didn&#39;t
trust the technology
they had concerns about it despite the
fact that we are as we&#39;ve all heard
there can be great safety gains now just
imagine a couple a couple situations
with me so you&#39;re on a long car trip and
you&#39;re starting to get sleepy and so
your car suggests to you why don&#39;t you
pull over at a the the upcoming outlet
of your favorite coffee shop you think
well isn&#39;t that a great invention isn&#39;t
that a great idea safety it&#39;s convenient
tells you where to go well what if your
car knew that it was your favorite
coffee shop by listening in on
conversations in the car or by reading
your email now another example comes
from the world of insurance so your your
car is collecting information about how
fast you&#39;re driving are you using your
turn signals or you&#39;re talking on the
phone a lot and imagine it&#39;s sharing
that information with your car insurance
company and that may be a good thing you
may say okay that&#39;s gonna save me money
my rates might be lower because I&#39;m a
safe driver but wouldn&#39;t you want to
know that the car was sharing that
information with the insurance company
so the question for a government
regulator and enforcer like myself is
how do we address these some kinds of
concerns while still allowing connected
cars to reach their full potential so
there&#39;s a few options that we could
pursue now the first one would be to do
nothing just leave things as they are to
continue down the road of having
regulation or enforcement that looks at
a driver separate from from an
automobile but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very
realistic cars have become essentially
computers on wheels they&#39;re doing great
things but they&#39;re collecting a lot of
information and we&#39;re relying on the
more and more now the other approach
would be what I might call the the Model
T assembly line approach which is
adopting a one-size-fits-all approach
that tries to predict
all the things that might happen and
come out with a single solution for that
but my experience with that has been
that these things get bogged down in a
lot of red tape and they&#39;re not very
flexible and they ultimately don&#39;t serve
society very well so an example that
comes to mind is trying to use existing
taxi regulations to regulate car sharing
services like uber and lyft and other
ones that that model that old taxi model
didn&#39;t fit very well in the regulation
of these new car ride-sharing services
and that&#39;s something I&#39;ve seen a lot of
at the FTC over the years where you have
a new innovator come into a market and
the old regulations are a poor fit and
that&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;ve created
an economic Liberty task force at the
FTC to work with state and federal
regulators to try to adjust regulations
and get these kind of barriers out of
the way for new for new technologies now
a different approach from the
one-size-fits-all is what I would call
the custom car approach and I think the
FTC model represents this kind of
approach so the FTC I&#39;ll give you a
little background on it I&#39;m currently
the chairman there so the FTC is a
bipartisan agency we have Republicans
and we have Democrats and our mission we
have a dual mission is to protect
competition is to promote competition
and to protect consumers and we do this
in a variety of ways but the basis for
this is the FTC Act which requires
companies to operate honestly in the
marketplace and to avoid inflicting
substantial injury on consumers and
we&#39;ve had a history of success in
enforcing this kind of regulation and
preventing deception and prevent
unfair harm while still trying to allow
innovation to to develop and new
products to come into the market without
having to predict exactly what those new
products are and how they will work so
to give you some examples in the car
area we have brought enforcement actions
against a number of car companies the
number of things in the automobile
industry so going back to the 1970s
we brought an enforcement action against
Buick for not telling consumers that
some of the cars they were selling were
used now more recently we had a very big
case you may have heard about against VW
we alleged that they had made
misrepresentations about the emissions
the harmful emissions from their diesel
vehicles and we entered into a rather
large settlement with VW requiring them
to be honest about what their emissions
were but also providing 14 billion
dollars in fines and redress to
consumers so there are three different
ways that the FTC can carry out this
role of trying to protect consumers
while allowing innovation to flourish
the first role that we can play is
educating the public and the public
includes business so we have a wealth of
information for businesses giving them
advice and guidance on how to protect
consumers privacy and safeguard their
sensitive data so we offer this to
businesses give them ideas give them
suggestions about being honest with
consumers about how they&#39;re using their
data we give them an advice on how to
secure that data it have strong
passwords have firewalls have a process
in place we also provide guidance to
consumers and an automotive example
comes to mind that we did recently where
consumers were
connecting their devices in rental cars
to the infotainment system and we put
out some consumer education informing
them that they should be aware of the
fact that that infotainment system might
be collecting their our sensitive data
their personal data and they should
think twice about whether they wanted to
connect to that and if they did decide
to connect to it to be sure that they
erased that data before they returned
the car now a second activity that the
FTC can do and we do a lot of this is
enforcing the FTC act we can take action
when a company crosses the double yellow
line by doing something deceptive or
unfair that causes substantial injury to
consumers recently we brought an
enforcement action against uber now you
may recall that there was a quite a lot
of hubbub in the press a few years ago
when an uber executive told a reporter
that uber could follow where that
reporter had traveled by looking at that
reporter&#39;s travel records in uber and so
obviously this caused a big uproar and
uber admitted that it was using this
tool called God view to follow the
movements of certain certain people so
uber then promised that it would not
allow employees unfettered access to
rider data or driver data and it would
only allow access for legitimate
purposes well we came to found out find
out that uber wasn&#39;t fulfilling that
promise and so we brought an action
against them earlier this year and uber
settled it with us and they had a
promise not to make misrepresentations
about their privacy and data security
but more importantly uber also had to
implement a comprehensive privacy
program without site audits and as part
of the settlement with the FTC uber has
to apply that privacy program in those
audits to connected cars as it moves
into into that space then the final tool
that the FTC can use is
to encourage self-regulation industry
tends to be on the forefront of these
issues and be very aware of what
problems may arise but their products
that we don&#39;t even yet know about what&#39;s
coming down the road and how that may
impact consumer and so the FTC has
encouraged industry self-regulation in
this space I&#39;m glad to see that the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and
the global Manufacturers Association
have adopted privacy principles about
how they&#39;re connected cars will collect
and use consumer information and we&#39;ve
encouraged other members of the industry
to follow these principles cybersecurity
is also in a ship and we&#39;ve encouraged
the auto industry to share things like
threat signatures and other alone alerts
and other kinds of information that
could impact cybersecurity for cars and
they&#39;ve created an auto I sac to share
these kinds of information I believe
that the FTC&#39;s Custom Car approach can
help get us to the right place with
autonomous vehicles encouraging
companies to obey the rules of the road
to protect consumers privacy and data
security so that consumers feel more
comfortable with this technology and if
we get it right I&#39;m very excited about
what the future holds for people like my
mother and all of us in our everyday
lives and I&#39;m very excited about the
benefits that will come to myself my
children my grandchildren and all of you
here as we move down the road towards
the innovation in driving thank you
