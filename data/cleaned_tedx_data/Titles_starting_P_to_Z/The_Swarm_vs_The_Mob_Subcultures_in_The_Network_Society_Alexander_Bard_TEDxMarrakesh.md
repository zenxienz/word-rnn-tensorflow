I come from the music industry and think
about the music industry you have
artists to perform on stage right now
PowerPoint and giving a lecture be the
equivalent to performing playback you
put together all your slides to the
night before and then you get up on the
stage the next day and you got an
interesting audience and suddenly
somebody says something really
interesting and all you can say is that
well that&#39;s really interesting but
fortunately not my next slide and the
ears start right so we&#39;re gonna perform
very live today I&#39;m going to use a
little whiteboard in the pen and that&#39;s
all I&#39;m gonna do which is kind of ironic
because I&#39;m going to talk about high
technology that&#39;s what I do okay here
you go
so imagine you arrived on planet Earth
in 2017 from a foreign planet so we&#39;re
next interesting what would you report
back to your home planet you have no
idea of the history of this planet you
just a right here in 2017 and all you
see is this planet right now
you would probably report back that
planet Earth consists of a phenomena
seems to know where it&#39;s heading and
this phenomena is called the Internet
and to this phenomenon you have 7
billion very confused bodies that are
connected to the phenomena itself
that&#39;s essentially what planet Earth
looks like today it&#39;s very very chaotic
and it&#39;s very chaotic for the simple
reason that were right now going through
the fourth major evolution of human
history because if you look at it
historically speaking we have four
different paradigms and I&#39;m going to
build them from the bottom up we have
four different paradigms all depending
on how a human beings communicate with
each other you see we have four
different ways of communicating we
developed them at four different points
in time in history and each time a new
communication technology has come along
this communication technologies meant
that the amount of information available
to human beings has exploded but the
amount of information is always stuck in
a certain place
and what&#39;s ironic is that with each one
of these revolutions the new bigger pile
of information he&#39;s always stuck in a
place that&#39;s radically different from
the place where he was stuck the last
time meaning that at the old pile of
information you will have a class of
people who think that things are like
this and they will always remain this
way and these people tend to be very fat
and lazy and conservative and they don&#39;t
want to change where suddenly in a
different place completely unheard of
before and of course underrated by the
old elite you will discover there is a
much bigger pile of information that a
windshield will take over the world and
at this new pile of information you will
have a new class emerging of people who
are very smart and clever at
communicating in this new method with
this new way of communicating probably
without even knowing it
and this is exactly what&#39;s happening in
the world today we have 12 major clouds
of information called you know the super
clouds today in the world out of which
five are located in North America five
are located in China one each in India
and Russia and there&#39;s not a single one
in Europe but why is that well because
the last major revolution that happened
happened in 1450 in Europe so Europe is
full of very fat and lazy old people who
don&#39;t want to move I happen to live in
that continent it&#39;s incredibly pathetic
ok nothing&#39;s really happening the way
you do things in Europe is that maybe we
should have a cloud - in Europe and then
you organize some French bureaucrats
within the European Union to develop a
model for building a cloud over ten
years time and then finally when you
make the decision well we should build
the cloud in Europe too
then you got some old ladies who think
their view will be disturbed so they
take it to court and stop the whole
prodding from happening
that&#39;s why not a single skyscrapers
build anywhere in Europe but they&#39;re all
built in China every week that&#39;s the
difference right so I&#39;m ashamed of
coming from your being European is like
being really bad these days but looking
at this we have four different ways of
communicating the first one we develop a
spoken language about a hundred and
fifty thousand years ago the second one
was written language which he only
developed about five thousand years ago
ironically in
rakh you know it&#39;s probably not the
center of the world these days then we
develop printed language from 1450
onwards starting in Germany at least I
know the Chinese developing before that
but they happened in Germany in 1450
when I talk about technological change I
really talk about the change itself not
the official place for the innovation
and after print the language we know how
to talk about interactive language an
interactive language started in the
1980s and it&#39;s now exploding across the
world you&#39;re now on average spending
something like five or six hours a day
staring at smartphones and laptops these
smartphones laptops did not even exist
thirty years ago so something has just
moved itself into your life and taken
over completely like five or six hours a
day which is now about as much as you
sleep every day and it&#39;s moving towards
seven or eight hours and we got virtual
reality and new computer games and we
get augmented reality all these things
happening around the corner meaning 30
years or not you&#39;re probably gonna spend
every waking minute of your day online
I&#39;ll tell you one thing I invest in
addiction clinics it&#39;s the safest
investment you could possibly make for
the future because we&#39;re all going to be
addicts 10 years from now at all these
technologies addiction clinics are
exploding everywhere and you can&#39;t move
them and you can&#39;t reinvent them in
Korea or China they have to be exactly
where people live but that&#39;s a good idea
but that&#39;s we&#39;re moving now we&#39;re moving
into the interactive age in a big way
interactive technology is killing all
the other previous three ways of
communicating we&#39;re not really printing
anything any longer if your mass
distributes something we do it
interactively we do it electronically
online we&#39;re certainly not handwriting
anything we stopped and writing about
1550 about how do years after I the
printing press there was not a single
handwriting monk or non left in Europe
at all they stopped they tried to stop
the development as best they could in
1517 France introduced death penalty for
the use of the printing press didn&#39;t
really work did it you know what I left
the music industry I left the music
industry when they started hiring
lawyers chasing teenagers and record
companies any industry where they employ
lawyers to chase teenagers is dude okay
cuz seniors would always do whatever
they want and they will always ignore
their parents if that happens in your
industry get out because he&#39;s probably
dying you know Spotify is probably not
worth more than all the words record
companies combined in took less than ten
years with Spotify to get there
an example so these revolutions do
happen but what is interesting though is
that these revolutions always happen in
the new place but that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s
happening in the world today we have
Wi-Fi everywhere your Y franklinia in
India in Bangladesh in South America you
don&#39;t only have Wi-Fi in Germany and
actually in Germany&#39;s probably crappier
than it is in Bangladesh Germany still
has cab drivers who you pay in cash in
Kenya you don&#39;t even have credit cards
anymore because in January pay with
mobile payment systems meaning the
German companies do they have to pay for
Keeney and patents because Kenya is much
hunger and edit in Germany is and this
is always what happens a paradigm shift
there are always hungry people out there
who like you don&#39;t have curiosity and
and they want to get out there and they
realize they suddenly have a technology
in front of them that can help them
really empower themselves and that&#39;s
what&#39;s wonderful with the internet even
it&#39;s empowering millions even billions
of people around the planet right now
who discovery that they can be ahead of
other people competing with others ok
now the problem with this is that this
entire development happened over the
last 5000 years and if you&#39;re gonna make
it really thorough study what&#39;s going on
at the moment we have to use but we can
only use only these two factors what
does it mean to be human and what is
technology and we&#39;ll then discover the
being human is a constant in our
analysis and technologist variable
meaning that we human beings haven&#39;t
really changed over the past 5,000 years
we still give birth to the same stupid
baby as we did 5,000 years ago that&#39;s
exactly what women who go on Instagram
these days they post you know pictures
of cats and babies because they had tats
and babies in the tribe five thousand
years ago they love cats and babies the
problem is that all women post pictures
of cats and babies so they&#39;re not their
original meaning that 95% of pictures on
Instagram are not seen by anybody you
know these girls you have Instagram all
of you and you know you just upload
pictures all the time like if there&#39;s
some expecting audience out there
waiting to see your picture well there&#39;s
no audience out there cuz everybody else
is busy uploading the same Catherine
baby pictures as you are I always tell
this to people about the internet nobody
knows what they&#39;re doing if they knew
what they were doing they would do
things very different than what they did
so we are human and that means
that it&#39;s in the spoken language
paradigm that we are stuck genetically
we are born into tribes we are looking
for tribes everywhere and this exactly
why this hits the button on a really
terrible new religion we invented that
came after printed language what
happened after printed language that all
over Europe you had people who were
sitting with a little lamp at night and
they were reading books and this person
started believing in a new religion that
was invented in 1637 called
individualism
well individualism is now dying it&#39;s now
an underclass phenomenon to take a
selfie
you&#39;re a vulgar person if you do
especially if you&#39;re a man and you&#39;re
over 40 years old you tend to believe
that the Internet is a phenomenon where
you&#39;re supposed to post a newsletter
about yourself every week you all know
that newsletter right you get it in your
mailbox all the time he&#39;s always a man
he&#39;s over 40 years old and he&#39;s trained
to think that he&#39;s gonna dominate the
world so he writes a newsletter about
himself every week and at the end of the
week in the newsletter says here&#39;s my
new book c&#39;mon you reckon here&#39;s where
you can buy what do we do with this
newsletter about this guy talking about
himself all the time we throw it in the
spam box cause we hate it because
individualism is dying and it&#39;s dying
process and because we are returning to
the tribe so the first thing the
internet enables us to do when suddenly
seven billion people are all active
participants in the communication is
that we&#39;re looking for tribes now but
here&#39;s the problem though this system of
tribes worked when we were nomadic and
we were nomadic we were walking around
across the planet trying to find food to
eat all the time we had met tree arts at
the center of the tribe we had
patriarchs at the outer circle of the
tribe these were their older men and
older women who ruled the tribe because
obviously the oldest person in the
tribal is the data bank it says the only
place where you could store information
at the time was in your mind so we
memorize things
that&#39;s why younger people respected the
older there was no division between men
and women in that sense women were as
powerful as men were because the only
division that existed was we need older
and the younger me need have a program
to think within the tribe that older
people probably more much than the
younger people do and they
it&#39;s called life experience these days
but this is the structure we train to
think so we tried to find the structure
anything we move into in this
environment that means that when you
look at Facebook for example the vast
majority of people will only have 200
Facebook friends and then they&#39;re set
okay so you get 200 Facebook friends you
know what most of these 200 Facebook
friends also tend to live in your own
neighborhood they also tend to be of
your gender they also tend to have your
sexual orientation whatever that is they
also tend to be your own ethnicity
because we&#39;re trained to think that if
we just have 200 people around us
everything we need in our lives will be
fulfilled and in the world of social
analysis where I work I should write
down this word social analysis Here I am
a philosopher meaning that I don&#39;t do
sociology sociology is brilliant but
it&#39;s an empirical science sociology
relates to psychology psychology is a
science about single human beings
sociology is the same science about
groups or tribes now in the world the
philosophies that we do psychoanalysis
and I tell you one thing psychoanalysis
can go deeper than psychology because
precise I don&#39;t have to prove anything
it&#39;s an art form so Psychonauts art form
and the equivalent of that in social
arenas social analysis that&#39;s what we&#39;re
doing right here so if we take a social
analytical approach to the tribe what
are the benefits and what&#39;s the problem
with the tribe well the tribe really
worked here over 5,000 years ago meaning
most people today we&#39;ll try to find 200
Facebook friends and then they&#39;re said
and these Facebook friends try to
reflect themselves because within a
group of 200 we find exactly the amount
we think for program to think a
multiplicity meaning we have a diversity
of opinions for art which is good for
our survival but they&#39;re not too
different from ourselves meaning we can
still love them without an effort okay
in the world of social analysis we call
this intra tribal remember this it&#39;s a
very very little distinction here
different but it&#39;s dramatic because
opposed to inter tribal we have to look
at the inter tribal meaning why do you
have to
under Facebook friends were the cost of
having 5,000 Facebook friends is zero
the only reason you have 250 Reds
because you program to two elephants
you&#39;re now discovering you live in a
world that people have 5,000 Facebook
friends that are spread across the
planet are gonna be way ahead of you why
is that because suddenly you have media
where it doesn&#39;t cost you anything to
have more than 200 friends but that
means you have to fight your own genetic
programming which is that I&#39;m gonna be
fine with two other people that are
basically like me that&#39;s the easy part
we don&#39;t have to spend a single penny on
educating any human being on this planet
to love people that are the most 200
people out there because that&#39;s how we
survive in the tribe anything out the
tribe was just dangerous in enemy
territory
you&#39;d probably kill the person from
another tribe if you could okay here
though we are now seven billion people
on the same planet and we can&#39;t kill
each other that means the people who can
communicate the most efficiently with
seven billion people at least with
people of access to seven billion people
are going to be the winners of the
society and there are very few people
are born with the capacity to love
strangers that&#39;s bad news unless we
decide that the number one priority in
the 21st century is to force ourselves
educate ourselves to love strangers this
is a shift from the intertribal to the
intertribal I would say because we now a
technology we cannot get rid of the
genies out of the bottle from now we&#39;re
gonna have to live with the internet the
Internet&#39;s even construct you can throw
in a trunk
neutron bomb site it&#39;ll still be there
if human beings you know one day our
civilization is completely over
well we&#39;ll be left on this planet will
be cockroaches and the internet that&#39;s
it the internet with machines probably
rolling Yuman beings in so the incident
would not go away even if we do so we
now have to get adjusted to the fact
that this phenomenon has taken over the
world and that means we have to go to
ourselves we especially have to go to
our children and realize that the people
who can communicate the people are
different from themselves are gonna be
the winners in the society but it&#39;s
gonna take an awful lot of training to
be able to do that
now there&#39;s a challenge for you and this
is what the internet is all about thank
you so much for having
