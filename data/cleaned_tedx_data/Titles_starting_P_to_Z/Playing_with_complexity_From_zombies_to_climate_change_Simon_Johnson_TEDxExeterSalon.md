hi
so do all do we living is truly complex
and and that&#39;s what makes it both
beautiful and fascinating but it can
also make it frightening now our lives
bring us into contact with a seemingly
endless stream of complex concepts
places or situations and with six
billion seven billion of us living in
this in a post data age that stream has
turned into a torrent it can be easy to
feel lost but perhaps it&#39;s not just a
kind of cognitive overload which is
causing this kind of alienation if it
seems that our view of the world is
becoming more opaque well perhaps it is
I&#39;m arguing here for the creation of a
new set of human center tools are unable
to that designed to enable us to
interrogate complex systems in a native
way I think that games can be used to to
enable us to pull apart complex systems
play with them and approach them without
fear I think it&#39;s time we make
complexity playable well I&#39;m a game
designer at life and I specialize in
making games for the real world I&#39;ve
been a game designer for about 15 years
and from the start I was interested in
games that take place in the real world
that you played together with other
people and I think in part I&#39;m
interested in this kind of game because
I think it was easy for me to imagine
that people will be able to take the
lessons learned from games and apply
them to their real lives if they were
already playing away from screens and
out here in the real world so but the
real world games are a new thing and new
things need a lot of experimentation and
collaboration so back currency doesn&#39;t 8
I said everything called a globe the
interesting games lab which is the
world&#39;s first pervasive games testing
lab hello world first the but this is
what in particular was a lab and a
community developing initiative trying
to design could bring a lot of people
together to try experimenting with this
kind of form and pretty quickly it
developed into a festival of real-world
games called egg fest
which I ran for about six years and then
since then I mean I&#39;ve made games that
included a broad variety of topics these
have included things like the hacking
which was a gps-enabled bowler hat that
you may wear laughs but the but you
could find the Hat with your phone and
you&#39;d you get a message you get the you
could follow the Hat and when you found
the Hat where you would say excuse me I
do believe you&#39;d have my hat and then
they would have to take the hat off and
give it to you and then the world is
chasing you hounded was a game that
asked you to follow your nose so we laid
out Center trails across the city and
you had to follow these scent trails
across town while we simple taneous lee
chased you with dogs real dogs messes in
New York and the teacher was a kind of
creepy cute carry around a social robot
that I talked to you exclusively on
Twitter and essentially just criticized
you but it would it would it would it
would give you monster love points for
how well you looked after it the black
maze was the world&#39;s first bioaktiv
horror maze and words meant we you were
a bio harness and we sent you into our
pitch-black maze and then gave you one
thousand beats of your own heart to
escape the maze to two point eight hours
later the original citywide zombie chase
game yeah
what we did was first now if pretty soon
we realized that we were able to kind of
sneak the more complicated subjects in
on the back of these game stories but
there was always there was always a
thing else going on there for example
and just came to 48 hours later the the
challenges you presented with it was can
you survive the night in the zombie
apocalypse so that was like three miles
of a city we saw this across the UK
three miles of city that was laden with
zombies and you had to run through so
that&#39;s the kind of primary objective but
just your experience it was different
you and your friends would turn up into
the city and you&#39;d arrived as refugees
and you&#39;d be met by a kind of city
official and they would they would
welcome you in but then they&#39;d ask for
your supporting evidence of your claim
for asylum which of course you don&#39;t
have they given you a lot of time to get
your documentation together which is
impossible I&#39;m pretty soon you find
yourself being exploited by criminals
migrant worker only busted by the police
thrown back out of the city and on the
ramp your life from a zombies with the
only chance to find it a place call
asylum so all the while the game was
busy chasing a zombies it&#39;s also busy
turning you into an asylum seeker now on
the subject of complexity some of you
I&#39;m sure are aware of the problematic
predictions around the subject of peak
oil well we had our own version of this
when we hit something called peak zombie
so so yeah so around 2016 oh it&#39;s I said
have a new business we gots going and I
was but yeah well but don&#39;t be dead to
me and they were the new business I
wanted to take all this stuff I&#39;d
learned making these games and try and
apply it in a more kind of more direct
way in a way that you got a greater
impact on the world and also to get the
kind of complex subjects off the backs
even into the foreground and then how&#39;d
you do that I don&#39;t know but I think
something surprising happened the ODI
approached me the ODI at the Overseas
Development Institute and they said well
we have this new event and we&#39;d like to
you playing games with it and it&#39;s
called the the global festival of ideas
for a sustainable development no short
names here and so sure enough we started
working on this and we developed this
idea for a a game that could be a kind
of alternative interface to the to the
conference welcomes for a while and as
we worked on it the the the UN got
involved and they they big co-produced
it with us and we end up producing a
game that was all focused on the UN
sustainable development goals the proc
with the goals of course is that they&#39;re
massively complex hugely interconnected
and sometimes contradictory so we made a
thing called 2030 hive mind now the idea
here the real problem we were given is
that people who work in this sector
they&#39;re they&#39;re very good at what they
do but they they&#39;re so focused on it
they can tend to become siloed and they
they fail to see the kind of the
opportunity for collaborations even when
they exist so we wanted to make a game
that would enable them to look what
they&#39;re doing
kind of zoom out and see the kind of
ramifications what they&#39;re doing in this
broader picture to find new
opportunities for collaboration and if
you&#39;re going to develop
new strategies with people so to do this
we developed I got a multi-platform game
there was an there&#39;s an app that you
could use there was a set of a
interactive game tables you gather round
and of course this be in the modern era
and we had a run fake news and really it
was it&#39;s kind of the success of working
with partners like this on a game like
this that and they need to really
understand and how impactful play games
an agency could be if we&#39;re dealing with
these big complex subjects so this is
the this is the kind of toolkit and
agency is key to all of this the key
thing about agency is that you&#39;re
immediately involved it&#39;s it&#39;s about
it&#39;s about starting with that
involvement and the core of this is that
the you know the the player is active
players make choices and those choices
matter as a player you don&#39;t receive
information you take it and play can be
anything and you play as any kind of
open-ended activity that you enter into
voluntarily it should be fun but I mean
play comes with this a whole other set
of opportunities play labels you to do
it wrong on purpose
just to see what happens plays a safe
space for which you took on failing and
we&#39;re all desperately needing
opportunities to fail because you can&#39;t
learn unless you fail and in games games
are the games that are kind of hard to
this because games give you all of these
tools look at the core of this is that
games have a goal this is kind of like a
reason for engaging in the first place I
think you&#39;re trying to do it&#39;s the
overarching you&#39;re trying to achieve but
then the games themselves are made of
all these components game to have
aesthetics they have stories they have
technologies they have mechanics and all
of these things become compelling tools
so here&#39;s an approach group let&#39;s take
play games an agency and use them to to
try and enable people to interact with
complex systems in a in a way that would
be frightened otherwise let&#39;s use this
system to to enable people to look at
complex systems and instead of just
walking well you can play with this you
can pull it apart and you can see what
it does okay so complexity now lots of
things in our lives are hard to
understand but the complex subjects I&#39;m
talking about here tend to have these
three traits
and scale so there are a scale but that
mean that either too big or too small
for us to understand I mean it&#39;s yeah we
don&#39;t have a frame of reference for
understanding like the really large
numbers or really big scales or small
scale so we need some way of looking at
this intricacy well complex systems are
frequently made of multiple subsystems
all vying for attention and it&#39;s it&#39;s
the the the relationship between these
subsystems which is an often case is the
most important that&#39;s where you get
they&#39;re gonna possibility for in seeing
a new kinds of emerging behavior but
that&#39;s really complicated and
unpredictability now once you&#39;ve got a
system which has got so many parts
interacting they&#39;re all free to interact
as they want to then it becomes very
difficult to predict the future state to
these systems you have to do it in terms
of kind of probabilities but that&#39;s
that&#39;s really not satisfying we don&#39;t
understand that you already understand
what that kind of a chance means complex
systems that I&#39;m not talking here about
some some mystical thing I talk about
things which you experience in our lives
all the time
so here&#39;s a problem for you suffer
please consider the following problem
what should we have for dinner tonight
should we have beef fish or tofu and
when you considering your answer please
consider the food miles can contained in
each the amount of water whose produce
each the co2 produced by each might have
land these plates the number of jobs
produced are sustained by the industries
of each salt content to fat content the
vitamin content the of course the cost
of these things yeah answer it&#39;s too
complex as a pattern instead it&#39;s it you
can&#39;t really know the numbers involved
always out of scale they the intricacy
is super high like how many different
systems are involved there how do they
all relate to each other and in the end
it&#39;s just unpredictable you don&#39;t really
know if I make this decision of that
decision what&#39;s gonna happen okay so
we&#39;re an exit today who would be
remissed we not to point out another
prime example for complex systems the
weather as for scale it wraps around the
whole work planet as for intricacy it&#39;s
made of innumerable subsystems all of
which are connected in subtle ways and
yet it&#39;s famously hard to predict
I&#39;m the same kind of access there&#39;s a
good look at the car tools so for scale
we need calibration tools if you forgive
you a figure you need some means to
understand that so you need to frame of
reference so a calibration tool will
take will ask you questions about
yourself and then use those answers to
create this missing frame of reference
intricacy well you need a few things for
this so first of all if systems have
multiple parts you need to wave look at
them so you need a way of laying them
all out in such a way that you can see
them and then you need to appreciative
appreciative they affect each other this
means you&#39;re gonna have people to
reconfigure them so that these systems
might might be like maps but maps that
you can dynamically reconfigure yourself
and then unpredictability well we&#39;re
pretty bad at probabilities in fact
we&#39;ve had a statistics generator we have
no intuition for it so we don&#39;t really a
grass what any of these statistics
really mean so we&#39;re gonna need
something which enables us to play with
those and again give us some kind of
calibrated experience of them the other
thing of course is that we have to get
away from this idea of kind of linear
progression that not all things are
immediately causal in that way
in fact so many things in life are
emergent and I mean yeah and as such
don&#39;t really exist in that kind of cell
properties so you really have to look at
expecting the unexpected and what I&#39;m
talking about like I think the best
things in life you know I think the all
these things that are these emerging
properties I&#39;m talking here by like life
love international banking crisis yeah
okay so so why now well there&#39;s never
been more of us the problems we face
have never been more pressing and but
also we have these kind of opportunities
so so but if we look at a problem like
climate change perhaps the
quintessential complexity of our times
it&#39;s a problem that covers everything
from the food we eat to the weather to
the future survival of life on this
fight so it&#39;s completely out of scale we
have no idea for the no way of
understand the numbers involved there
are so many systems so many subproblems
all jostling for a tangent everything
seems to need fixing first and yeah it&#39;s
completely unpredictable
I mean how where we gonna go with this
using this toolkit we can start to pull
it apart and we can start to pull the
blip apart and understand these things
in a kind of an intuitive way
so I manifesto let&#39;s create a new class
of games that Nabal us as individuals
and as communities to engage with big
they either do dauntingly complex now
these new tools should be social in that
they enable us to find new ways of
collaborating with each other they
should be personal in that frame of
reference they use created with us and
not for us
initially fun you know Hey
