I was seven years old when I first set
foot into a record store it was a sunny
day in South of France and me and my
brother were to pick out any album would
like and I did so purely based on the
aesthetics of the album cover as you do
when you&#39;re seven years old this album
cover in particular was all black except
for eight big shining silver letters
that said Daft Punk I was intrigued and
so I walked out with a fresh copy of
Daft Punk&#39;s discovery in my hands and
even though my next few years were spent
playing very aggressive punk rock music
discovery would stick with me and later
play a vital role in the way that I make
music now I suppose many of you don&#39;t
know me my name is Sebastien I make
music I produce write and perform
usually under the moniker of cooter on
and have been doing so for the last
seven years so so why did Daft Punk&#39;s
discovery stick with me through those
angry rock&#39;n&#39;roll days I&#39;m pretty sure
it has to do with the way they sampled
music it didn&#39;t sound like electronic
dance music the way I was used to I used
to hate dance music back then but the
sounds of discovery they didn&#39;t sound
harsh or really electronic at all in
discovery you could hear brass sections
you hear
funky tars and vocal chops but Daft Punk
didn&#39;t play all these instruments
themselves they sampled older records
they sampled their idols songs from pop
funk soul and rock they pieced them all
together and form sort of a collage of
all the things they loved so sampling is
when you take a piece of audio recording
and
use it in another audio recording you
can think of it as recycling almost and
what&#39;s always fascinated me about it
isn&#39;t the ability to steal someone&#39;s
idea or another ones melody but the
ability to capture an atmosphere from a
different time in a different place and
place it into our own into something
unperformed a bowl I&#39;m gonna play you a
song by Eddie Jones this is more spell
on you and it was released in 1979
[Music]
as cool as cool as it sounds it does
sort of sound like an average song of
your mother&#39;s old disco record but two
French guys managed to find three very
important brass tabs within this very
short snippet this one this one and this
one they slow them down and lift them
and eventually came up with one of the
most iconic album openers of all time
that was daft punk&#39;s one more time and
I&#39;ve grown to learn that so many of the
songs I loved and had loved are based
around samples like this where the
source material isn&#39;t so striking by
itself but put into a different context
or a different decade it becomes bigger
than the sum of its parts it strikes a
totally different nerve now I want it to
be like Daft Punk so I did what they did
I went to look for older disco records I
sampled them in my bedroom and put them
out for the whole internet to hear but
then as it turns out there&#39;s a thing
called copyright who figures and it&#39;s
pretty heavily guarded and if you misuse
it someone will get mad they will take
your music off the internet and if
you&#39;ve made any money along the way they
will come and take that too there are
two key challenges and limitations when
it comes to sampling one of them being
these regulations revolving the audio
recording itself and the copyright
without the appropriate permissions
which can be near impossible to obtain
and often very expensive you might be
headed towards a rather unpleasant legal
ordeal and one of my favorite cases of
such is the story of Frank ocean&#39;s super
rich kids we&#39;re in the bridge section of
the song Frank ocean&#39;s sings about
searching for real love in a way that is
strikingly similar to that of a mary j
blige song called real of in real of
mary j blige sampled an audio rap group
called audio - audio - had again sampled
this drum loop from a 1979 record by the
honey drippers and it was their record
label that eventually sued Frank Ocean
and could now claim ownership in all of
these songs and this weird hierarchy of
sampling and interpolation
even though Frank ocean&#39;s lyric had
nothing to do we
that drum loop from 1979 so we&#39;ve now
established one of the two key
challenges the second one as I see it is
the absoluteness of an audio recording
it&#39;s pretty much set in stone in the way
that you can&#39;t go back in time and ask
Michael Jackson to sing something
differently or ask Jimmy Hendrix to just
play it cool on that solo part but what
if you were to make your own samples
wouldn&#39;t you then avoid these
regulations you don&#39;t you would also be
able to go back in time and make changes
to the samples themselves three years
ago I was tinkering around with a guitar
if that for some reason reminded me of
Ed Sheeran&#39;s I see fire and instead of
producing it out in the typical dance
music fashion that I was used to at the
time I decided to rather flesh it out as
a more folksy symphonic piece which I
wasn&#39;t good at doing at all
[Music]
I thought it sounded way pretentious and
super corny and of course I scrapped it
because I didn&#39;t know what to do with it
it didn&#39;t sound like anything that would
resonate with my audience at the time
but one year later is that was browsing
through old demos and folders as I heard
that guitar riff again I couldn&#39;t help
but hear it as a sample it gave me that
same sample urge that I was used to from
way back when I sampled disco records
and so I sampled myself only this time I
stayed clear of all copyright
infringement and was even able to go
back in time and alter the sample itself
[Music]
crazy I feel the most woman is cold
just in
down to the saloon that song ended up on
Kalani&#39;s grammy-nominated mixtape you
should be here and even though this is
no this wasn&#39;t a groundbreaking concept
at all after all I just reused one of my
old guitar ideas but this really sparked
a completely different way from you to
work I stopped worrying about ideas not
being finished not fitting my project or
brand or the politics of music and
instead I started encouraging myself to
go ahead and copy other people other
other songs that I admired only to
sample them at a later point now there&#39;s
no secret that I can&#39;t really play a
guitar like Prince or John Mayer nor can
I sing like Freddie Mercury but that&#39;s
become the most exciting and fun
challenge of them all and I can&#39;t it&#39;s
made me focus on things like how reggae
drummers accent certain beats Motown
recording techniques and common chord
progressions in gypsy jazz and this
obsession has grown into a pretty
extensive sample library of my own it&#39;s
it&#39;s really cool it&#39;s like a personal
record store where I can browse through
for all bits and pieces of sampling
inspiration like 80s
smooth jazz number 2
[Music]
now I would never really relief that ass
is because it sounds like actual
elevator music from the 80s but inside
that little snippet I managed to find
not quite unlike Daft Punk three little
soundbites I sped them up and those
three little soundbites eventually
became the fundament for one of my songs
called puzzled again strikes a totally
different nerve than the original sample
source and I have way more examples of
this here&#39;s dr. drum number two
[Music]
I went for a 80s soulful R&amp;B vibe but
that sample ended up in a pop rap song
by Pasha the Norwegian rapper called
pretty boy bounce
[Music]
so none of these samples are modeled
after specific songs more so after
specific times and errors in music
history and just this last week I was
listening to a rather famous surf rock
group and couldn&#39;t help but get inspired
to make a Christmassy doo-wop acapella
sample only I didn&#39;t have the Beach Boys
there to sing it for me so I had to do
myself
[Music]
again as is it sounds very typical and
classic and kind of boring but put some
hip-hop drums on top
[Music]
and suddenly it&#39;s pretty bangin I have
more obscure examples like bossa nova -
[Music]
and as much as I hate to disappoint you
that last one hasn&#39;t actually found its
home yet as is the case for most samples
in this library but at least now I don&#39;t
feel like I&#39;m wasting my time when I
write really stupid music like that
whereas I would previously look at maybe
95 percent of my work as just scrapped
ideas or waste of time they&#39;re now all
potential samples and I could browse
through my library all day but I&#39;m not
really here to promote my own music
rather to try and spark an idea and see
if there&#39;s anything about this approach
that could be applied to the way you
face creative challenges and I should
note that I&#39;m not the only one using
this work method in fact I have one very
last example to show you that I
unfortunately had nothing to do with if
I had I would be driving a nicer car I
had my friend and colleague a kettle
send me this
he works in a similar fashion and let me
just play it for you and see if any of
you recognize it
[Music]
you may have heard it in a song by la
Mettrie called closer but if someone
came into my room and I was working on
that they would tell me to get a real
job because that sounds stupid it sounds
like something out of a Donkey Kong game
but once that sample was flipped it
became their most successful song to
date closer I should clarify I still
have nothing to do with that song so via
this method the two key challenges of
sampling the regulations and the
absoluteness of an audio recording have
both been eliminated so instead of
stealing from others how about stealing
from yourself
