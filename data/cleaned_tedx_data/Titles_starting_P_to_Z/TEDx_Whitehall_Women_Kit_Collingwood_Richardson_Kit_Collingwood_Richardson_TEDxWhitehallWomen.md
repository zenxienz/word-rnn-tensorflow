don&#39;t know how are we doing for sound
can you hear me at the back do I need a
hand mic okay I&#39;ve been told I can&#39;t
wander around the stage but I am allowed
to dance so I can&#39;t guarantee that
wouldn&#39;t be doing that and I&#39;m so
excited to be here I&#39;m here today to
talk to you about empathy empathy is a
longstanding obsession of mine and it&#39;s
absolutely caught of my own values I&#39;m
also a civil servant so I work for the
government
now empathy and government are two words
that you rarely hear uttered in the same
breath I can&#39;t think why mmm
and this next few minutes is me telling
you about my adventures over the last
few months trying to bridge the gap
between these two disparate passions
that I have so if you don&#39;t know what
the civil service does we exist to help
politicians get stuff done so while
stated aim is we help the government of
the day to implement its policies and
what a policy is it&#39;s a really simple
thing its government&#39;s approach to a
societal need and need we all have how
do we design our health care system how
do we treat people in prisons where do
we build our road and rail network these
are all policies and many of these
policies become services that you
interact with every single day so
whether you&#39;re registering to vote or
you&#39;re applying for a passport or you&#39;re
getting cancer treatment there are
dozens if not hundreds of civil servants
of public servants behind the decisions
that make the interactions that you
experience from the state every single
day so as civil servants what do we need
to do to make our ideas and our policies
good well we need to make them a few
really obvious things they need to be
affordable because the state is big and
gnarly and expensive we need to make
them operationally viable so we are
living in reality land because we like a
bit of reality and we need to make them
politically and culturally acceptable
there is a whole separate talk about how
you do that which I won&#39;t focus on for
now but over and above all of those
things we need to make our ideas and our
policies effective and by effective I
mean to me extremely specific almost
every government policy is designed to
effect behavioral change so we make
things
to make you do stuff so we want you to
put your taxes on time we might give you
a tax break or maybe not and we run the
population to get fitter we might tax
sugary drinks or we might build bike
lanes these are all policies that you
might experience in order to do that
well we have to accurately predict what
you might do if we make these different
changes so we have to understand human
motivation we have to be able to walk in
your shoes that&#39;s empathy we need
empathy to do our jobs every single day
an empathy can make or break how how
good public policy is and I&#39;ll give you
an example in 1920 a group of largely
white Christian affluent teetotal policy
makers wanted people to drink less
now they had certain policy options
about how they did this they could have
taxed it very popular they could have
made a moral case against it they
decided to ban alcohol they gave us
prohibition they thought in their
homogeneous little policymaking bubble
that banning alcohol would make people
stop drinking alcohol oops
they fail to act with empathy and what
the US population realized was something
which one of the great thinkers of our
time
Homer Simpson expressed very well
seventy years later was this alcohol is
the cause of and solution to all of
humanity&#39;s problems most was like a pint
after work right nothing new there so in
this policy went ahead with predictable
outcomes and is another great thinker of
our time Calvin not John Calvin but
Calvin and Hobbes Calvin said how can
something that seemed so plausible being
retrospect so idiotic so this policy
played out with predictable outcomes
right there was a huge upsurge in
organized crime there was a huge loss of
tax revenue for the US government and a
tiny drop in alcohol consumption no pun
intended so here&#39;s my idea I think
public servants need to become experts
in the practice of empathy if we don&#39;t
we waste money we waste time and we let
you all down and we can&#39;t afford to do
that financially or morally
so how do you create empathy in an
organization like the Civil Service it&#39;s
very hierarchical and very highly
structured well I don&#39;t know the full
answer to that but I think I&#39;ve got
three things which will get us towards
it which will start to bridge that gap
between us and you between government
and people the first one&#39;s an absolute
no-brainer and Charlotte said it already
shut up and listen is what we need to do
so it should be an imperative of every
civil servant and every public servant
to talk to real people early on in our
policy development cycle about how idea
our ideas will impact them there&#39;s a
really simple philosophy of how you
predict somebody&#39;s behavior is by asking
them how they&#39;ll behave deceptive write
it sell that it sell them we actually do
that to meter garrets talk to people and
we need the humility to listen when
people say that our ideas are not good
enough and the boldness to iterate ideas
based on that secondly diversity
inclusion is absolute at the heart of
all this stuff now the civil service is
getting more diverse and more inclusive
and that&#39;s brilliant but we need to
focus more on recruitment from different
socio-economic groups so diversity of
viewpoint breadth of experience these
are things that give us the collective
empathy that we need to get better what
we do and thirdly something I&#39;m really
passionate about is rewarding and role
modeling empathetic behavior and that&#39;s
all about amplifying the many civil
servants who already think in these ways
normalizing the language of empathy
which is the language of base human
emotion love hope despair fear we need
to be able to talk about these things
and creating a space to have a different
conversation now I have habits of
creating spaces for different
conversations compulsively and that&#39;s
what I&#39;ve been doing these last few
months so I wanted to create a space to
have an empathy focused conversation
with a lot of public servants and I did
a little experiment
so in June I got 200 public servants
policymakers frontline staff designers
developers charities different groups to
come together to talk about empathy
driven ways of making government better
and what was heartening about that is it
really resonated with people people like
to get permission
CAIR hard about human outcomes and I
loved that what I learned from that
experience was to bridge the gap between
government and people we firstly need to
bridge the gap between ourselves so we
need high empathy between the different
professions and government so event was
really cool we had lots of fun and I
wanted to carry on the conversation so I
created an empathy driven reform
movement for government and we called it
one team government the idea of
singularity and what I mean by a
movement is we created more of these
conversations so more events we&#39;ve got
meetups we have a breakfast meeting
every Wednesday in the Treasury Building
right in the heart of Whitehall which I
just think is absolutely brilliant we
created principles about what we do the
first one it won&#39;t surprise you is to
care deeply about citizens and their
their feelings and their outcomes and we
put these words in will be distinguished
by our empathy towards people and
towards each other and we underpinned
that with a bunch of other principles
openness diversity and inclusion working
across boundaries experimenting with
ideas and this was my attempt to codify
empathy for the public sector so we had
these events we had these principles we
start to amplify good practice started
to turn up the dial on the people who
are already doing this stuff and what
we&#39;ve seen a result of that is these
principles are coming up they&#39;re popping
up in the normal machinery of government
something which I think is really cool
we see them in job ads now and
procurement documents and corporate
circulars people are really getting on
board with their stuff empathy is going
mainstream and it&#39;s not just in the UK
so we&#39;ve been contacted by about a dozen
foreign governments interested in the
principles that we&#39;re working to they
want to come and talk to us about them
and then take them back into their own
domains and there are so many of them
were going to hold a global event next
summer called wanting government global
to talk about how we use empathy driven
reform right across the world to share
common problems so this is super cool
right what have I learned from this
experience I&#39;ve learned
there&#39;s value in daring to think
differently there is value in changing
our conversation and it&#39;s amazing how
many people agree with you when you
start to do that and they wouldn&#39;t have
a chance to say it before I&#39;ve learned
that empathy is here already it already
exists in the public sector in absolute
spades you just need to give people
something to coalesce around and to
normalize the people who are already
doing this stuff and lastly I learned
something which I never ever experienced
before in which I never anticipated and
that&#39;s that we&#39;re harnessing a future
style of leadership these people
normalizing them legitimizing their
language and their thoughts and bringing
them together has given them the
confidence to speak up people who are
more open more porous more borderless
high empathy people they tend to be
younger and need a voice and I love the
fact that we&#39;ve done that so that&#39;s it
I&#39;m gonna leave you with one thought in
public service we need to be cool headed
but we need to be warm-hearted too and
empathy is at the heart of doing that
thank you
