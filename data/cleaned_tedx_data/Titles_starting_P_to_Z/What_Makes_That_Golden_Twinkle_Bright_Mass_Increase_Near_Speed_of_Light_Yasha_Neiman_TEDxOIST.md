outside right now it&#39;s a beautiful
Friday in Okinawa and as many of you
know the Japanese word for Friday is
Kineo B which literally means gold day
and the Japanese week there is no iron
day there is no silver day there is no
LED day only gold was considered worthy
of having its own day so I want to ask
what is it with us and gold yes there
may be some rulebook to human
civilization where it says in a very
serious tone of voice no there is this
metal called gold it&#39;s element number 79
in the periodic table and that is what
you&#39;re going to use for your currency
and where is jewelry and that&#39;s what
you&#39;re going to put in your vaults and
in your treasure chests and go to war
for very important element number 79
don&#39;t forget so no no our fascination
with gold has arisen without any such
instructions this is just we are simple
creatures and we are attracted to bright
and distinctive colors and it just so
happens that in a world full of grey
metals there is one metal that is yellow
so our question for today is why is gold
yellow now is that even a legitimate
question to ask and perhaps there is a
rulebook to the universe where it says
yes an element number 79 is going to be
yellow also element number 8 is good for
burning things
bunnies are good at hopping and frogs
are good at jumping but no we ain&#39;t come
this far in the scientific revolution to
keep thinking in these terms we
understand that all of these phenomena
of everyday life must be arising from
some deeper more fundamental laws that
are closer to the ultimate nature of
reality so now with renewed vigor and
the confidence that an answer should
exist hey why is gold yellow and the
answer it turns out to be remarkable and
is one of my favorite stories in all of
science and it is so deliciously
counterintuitive that even though it has
been known for something like 40 years
it is still managed not to percolate
into our general culture the papers from
the time
when these things were first understood
have magnificent titles like this one
that reads relativity and the periodic
system of elements
okay so relativity so these guys are
telling us that the color of gold as
well as some other phenomena like the
fact that mercury is a liquid have to do
with relativity with the strange and
wonderful behavior of objects near the
speed of light now the thing that most
of you know about the speed of light is
that it acts as the universal speed
limit so when Han Solo tells Chewbacca
Chewie take us to Lightspeed in the real
world that doesn&#39;t work which we can&#39;t
take us to Lightspeed the entire
structure of space-time conspires to
prevent him from following this simple
instruction and the particular way in
which that happens is that as you try to
accelerate closer and closer to the
speed of light you start getting heavier
and heavier
so that accelerating further becomes
harder and harder and eventually
impossible so the story that I want to
tell you today is that because of this
effect because of mass increase near the
speed of light gold turns out to be
yellow all right now today I spent all
morning talking to my scientists friends
around campus and I was asking them do
you know why gold is yellow and they say
no and I was telling the wallet it&#39;s
relativity and they have no idea what
I&#39;m talking about and I&#39;m telling them
it&#39;s mass increase near the speed of
light and they still have no idea what
I&#39;m talking about so I am sure that our
main audience are all smart people and
have already figured out the story from
these Clues but for the sake of my
friends let&#39;s fill in some more details
about how this actually works
the first counterintuitive twist in the
story is that it&#39;s not about the color
yellow at all this is a story about the
color blue ordinary gray metals are gray
because they reflect light in all the
colors of the visible spectrum and when
it comes to yellow gold is a plain
ordinary metal it reflects yellow just
as a metal should what is special about
gold is its reaction to the color blue
instead of reflecting blue it decides to
absorb it so what we see as the yellow
color of gold is really the overall
incoming white light with blue
subtracted the question is then why is
gold absorbing blue and this might sound
at the face of it quite scary so
ordinary metals don&#39;t absorb light at
all and this one does so something
radically different here but in fact
it&#39;s not as bad as that ordinary metals
also absorb light it&#39;s just that they
don&#39;t do it at the visible colors
instead they like to absorb ultraviolet
so the special thing about gold is that
it takes this behavior for it new metals
and shifts it from the ultraviolet
towards the visible blue so the question
of why is there a gold day in the
Japanese week then becomes why should
that decide to absorb blue instead of UV
at this point we should start getting
more physics e we should start replacing
all of these names of colors with some
number so what&#39;s a good number that
distinguishes ultraviolet light from
blue visible right one such number is
energy as we know well from getting
sunburned ultraviolet light is more
energetic than visible so really the
question is why is this one special
metal deciding to absorb light of lower
energy than usual and in order to start
answering that we need to remind
ourselves what matter is actually made
of it&#39;s a matter is made of atoms atoms
are made of electrons orbiting around
the nucleus and what usually happens
when matter absorbs light is that the
energy of the light gets picked up by
one of the outermost electrons in the
atom and the electron uses it to jump up
into the next available orbit so when we
are saying that the material absorbs
high-energy ultraviolet light we are
really saying that there is a large gap
between the orbits and if it&#39;s absorbing
low-energy blue light then we are really
saying that there is a smaller gap
between the orbits so the special thing
about gold is that the orbits and the
gold atom are closer together than they
should be
and if we look in a bit more detail we
will see that what
actually happening here is that it&#39;s the
top orbit that&#39;s changing the top orbit
is shifting down in gold as compared to
an ordinary metal well the next orbit
below is more or less staying put and
that is how the gap between them shrinks
so what&#39;s special about gold the reason
we go to war over the stuff is that the
topmost orbit in its atom is lower than
usual why is that well I told you why
because of mass increase near the speed
of light now you know I&#39;m looking at my
friends faces and I&#39;m seeing that they
are still not quite getting so let&#39;s go
deeper are we saying that when an
electron gets heavier its orbit becomes
lower oh yes we are
well how might that come about to
understand that we need to start
stepping away from the schoolbook
caricature of what an atom looks like
from the solar system here and remind
ourselves that electrons really obey the
rules of quantum mechanics and then they
are not quite little points going around
the nice circular orbits but much more
like waves spread out throughout the
entire circle of the orbit and the thing
about these waves is that heavy
particles have waves that are shorter so
what happens when an electron gets
accelerated close to light speed is that
it gets heavier its wavelength gets
shorter and because the wave has to span
the orbit then the orbit must shrink as
well and that&#39;s how we go from absorbing
ultraviolet towards absorbing blue and
this is how mass increase near the speed
of light manages to give us the golden
twinkle bright Oh what we haven&#39;t said
is what is it that gets an electron
anywhere close to the speed of light we
usually don&#39;t think about such things
happening in chemistry and you&#39;re the
thing to understand is that the gold
atom is a bit of a monster it is one of
the largest atoms that are commonly
found in nature its nucleus has a
whopping 79 protons inside and their
combined electrical interaction
attraction is what is capable of
accelerating an electron that gets too
close all the way
near the speed of light so there we go
that&#39;s the story all the relevant laws
of physics that are needed for telling
what they just told you have been around
since the 1920s but as far as I&#39;m aware
it took about 40 or 50 years after that
before this whole explanation was pieced
together and the reason is that in this
story there is something paradoxical
there is something that was putting off
people from thinking in this direction
you may have noticed that in what I&#39;ve
told you so far there hides a
contradiction because on one hand the
electrons that are in charge of
responding to light deciding what gets
reflected and what gets absorbed are the
outer electrons inside the atom and the
other hand the electrons that are
getting close to the nucleus accelerated
and then were heavier are the ones
closest to the nucleus and the inside of
that so that makes no sense in order for
this to be the mechanism behind the
color of gold an electron must be
somehow doing both things at once but
that of course is exactly what electrons
in quantum mechanics do they are not
quite waves going around in a circle
around the nucleus they are rather more
like clouds of probability to find an
electron distributed all over the volume
of the atom it&#39;s just the higher orbits
are just ones that are more concentrated
on the outside the lower orbits are more
concentrated on the inside but both in
principle span both here and there and
so this is how a single electron can
both be on the inside right next to the
nucleus getting accelerated to near the
speed of light and getting heavier
because of its end at the same time be
outside reacting accordingly to light
and deciding to absorb the blue all
right now we&#39;re almost there
Gold is almost yellow but something is
still
because remember that in order to decide
how a material reacts to light what is
important are the gaps the distances
between the different orbits it is not
enough for the top orbit to come down it
is also important that the next orbit
below doesn&#39;t only then the distance
between them can shrink and we can turn
ultraviolet absorption into blue
absorption and make our gold yellow so
why does everything we just said apply
only to the topmost orbit how can we
have two orbits that are behaving in
this radically different ways aren&#39;t
they just the same thing only one of
them is a bit higher and the other is a
bit lower and turns out that this is
much the same question as why do atoms
behave as Lego blocks why do they attach
to each other in molecules at fixed
angles where this chemistry work the way
it does now now are you feeling it yes
the the ground is getting more and more
sacred as we talk you know I&#39;m not a
religious guy but just as a precaution
this is a good point to take off one&#39;s
shoes so an electron is not quite a
point running around in a circle inside
the atom it is not quite a wave running
around in a circle either and it is not
quite a cloud of probability distributed
throughout the atoms volume it is all
those things it is much more like a wave
of probability distributed throughout
the volume of the atom and this here
these waves of probability this is the
beating heart of quantum mechanics the
secret operating system of the universe
revealed by the great sages of the 1920s
the fundamental magic behind the myriad
phenomena of the everyday and the
ultimate reason why gold manages to be
yellow after all the thing about waves
is that when two waves meet they can
either add up and reinforce each other
or they can cancel out and subtract so
when we ask ourselves what is the
electrons probability to find itself at
the center near the nucleus and feel its
might
Electrical attraction what we should
really be doing is we should be taking
the waves of electron probability coming
in from all the directions in the atom
at once adding up at the center meeting
each other at the center and deciding
what to do and then for one orbit it
might happen that these waves will adapt
reinforce each other and create a blob
of probability for the electron to be in
the center get accelerated heavier and
the orbit will come down but or for a
different orbit it could be that the
waves coming in from different
directions in the atom are opposite to
each other is they subtract and then you
get no probability for the electron to
be at the center near the nucleus and no
effect so this is how it&#39;s possible for
the top orbit to come down well the next
orbit below stays but this is how we can
get from absorbing UV light to absorbing
blue light this is how we can get from
gray to golden hey thanks to mass
increase near the speed of light with a
healthy dose of help from the
probability wave fundamental nature of
matter at the quantum level now I dare
you not to become a scientist thank you
very much
