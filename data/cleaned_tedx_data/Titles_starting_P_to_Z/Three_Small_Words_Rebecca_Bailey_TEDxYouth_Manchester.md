hi my name is Becky short for Rebecca
which in turn I guess is short for
captivating or snare a name that is said
to represent beauty in the Bible now I
don&#39;t think there is a God
I&#39;m not blessed enough to have such
strong beliefs at least not where
religion is concerned what I do campaign
for and I use that verb very loosely is
confidence confidence is the belief that
you are good enough just as you are the
belief that you are capable and
beautiful for many as I laughed at my
name as I picked at my spot prone skin
in a mirror that hated me and focused on
making myself look better for the girls
that had called me everything but
beautiful for the past year I cursed my
parents even giving me that name I
likened it to calling a naked mole-rat
of rose or a blobfish a swan I would
blame my plummet into self hate entirely
on those girls those beautiful girls but
with every ounce of honesty that I
possess I can tell you now that their
words were only a single bullet in the
gun that declared my mind was going to
war with my body me versus me the love
that my family showed me versus the
hatred that showed towards myself
they&#39;re my family coud at the way I
could fit a three-course meal into a
pancake flat stomach I saw myself as
greedy as disgusting I stopped eating
lunch because the other girls would
nibble on their carrot sticks and roll
their eyes at my sandwich and full fat
yogurt I liked many girls and boys was
blown to pieces by the toxic thoughts
that creep through society on biased
agenda or age today we are bombarded by
double standards and large posters and
campaigns depicting the idealistic body
that in reality is extremely difficult
to achieve let alone maintain these
images are the legions of plastic
abhrush troops that lead the attack on
our self-esteem they force us to enlist
in a war that we don&#39;t want to fight in
they force us to join their side and
fire to ourselves as we crawl through
the mine ridden no man Sun that is our
own mind I think that if I had been told
by the media which is arguably the most
influential thing in a young person&#39;s
life that everybody was beautiful then I
wouldn&#39;t have tried to change my own
because that&#39;s the truth of it every
single body in the world is beautiful in
its own way I don&#39;t think we here
those three words enough I still have
days when I&#39;m too scared to look in the
mirror but now I have people who look at
me in the morning and accept every inch
of me I still don&#39;t think I&#39;m worthy
enough to represent the bible&#39;s version
of beauty but I now know that I&#39;m worthy
enough to join everyone else&#39;s and
representing the world if you haven&#39;t
already done so today go up to someone
and call them what they are beautiful I
hope that this has maybe helped you win
your own battle and I hope that one day
we&#39;ll all know that when we look in the
mirror we are captivating we are worthy
we are beautiful thank you
[Music]
you
