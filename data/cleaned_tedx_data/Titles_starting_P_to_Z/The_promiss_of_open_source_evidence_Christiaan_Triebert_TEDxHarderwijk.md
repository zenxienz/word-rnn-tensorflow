we live in the era of the post truth era
is set the era of fake news of alternate
effects and it seems that opinions are
decreasing Lee based on objective facts
but rather on emotions on belief and so
on and if we look at the thousands of
ways we can spread these messages
through the world wide web you can get
pretty pediment pessimistic actually but
in the coming 15 minutes I&#39;d like to
show you something new a silent
revolution if you wish and this is all
about using online information to
challenge more powerful actors in as
world&#39;s to challenge - to figure out
what the facts are and this is called
digital open source investigation and
basically anyone with an internet
connection and anyone with a laptop can
access so much information that very
same information that is being spread
around in this post through Thera to use
and to figure out what may be going on
but well this is the best I can do with
my PowerPoint animations I&#39;d like to
start with with basically it&#39;s not as a
game this is a facebook friend of mine
asking a Dutch journalist and he&#39;s
posting pictures on his facebook profile
asking Nara VAR benek or guess where am
I now this is a nice game right because
he posts a photo and in this initial
case I recognized the skyline because I
used the hitchhike a lot and I&#39;ve been
to the city several times and I
recognized the skyline of the capital of
Poland Warsaw so I thought okay wait a
second I can actually figure out where
he took the photo from so I went to
Google Earth and you have 3d in Google
Earth and I figured out the exact
location when he took the photo from as
you can see you can see the exact
building which he for example see here
we can see here and so forth the skyline
so I commented under his folder like
well I think you&#39;re in the logos Hotel
in Warsaw I guess around the fifth or
sixth floor and he reacted fourth floor
but there is a kind of floor in between
so I was kind of right
so this became a more of a nice game to
play he posted a photo I sometimes
really easy I mean I think all of you
know what is this right exactly London I
mean the bus is Oxford Street and London
to be exact and again I can use Google
Street View for example to stand at the
exact location where he took the photo
from now sometimes it can get more
tricky so you start looking for visual
clues like for example there&#39;s no
landmark here and so on so you have to
look for for maybe sign somewhere okay
this may be in the Netherlands and so
forth and we try finding he has exact
location again now sometimes there isn&#39;t
even buildings or science it&#39;s just a
landscape for example here now you may
think how on earth can you ever find
this but I was originally born in in
Levada and never would travel to
Schiphol for example anyone who has ever
traveled with a train from
almera to a laylee stop knows what a
kind of depressing area this between
those two cities so I was like this
counter should be one area under
Netherlands right this must be between
those cities and then it&#39;s just looking
for the river on satellite imagery and
the train tracks and indeed I could
figure out the exact location even the
bend in the river the tree trees and
even the the white spots here of sand
this is a game but this is using online
up information which is openly available
to anyone with an internet connection to
figure out an answer to those questions
it&#39;s a puzzle
and three years ago a group was found a
collective called Belen cats to bring
those people that are doing this
together and to work together on more
let&#39;s perhaps a important questions not
the game with a Facebook friends but
figuring out what&#39;s happening in a
conflict zone what is happening between
well in in in in more and belen cat stem
from the English idiom the cat or in
Dutch as we say the cotton bellum in
them and it&#39;s from a Greek fable of a
group of mice that is very afraid of his
large and dangerous cat and they&#39;re
wondering how can we be aware when the
cat is coming close and we are being
well we are in on the truth and one idea
one Mouse has an idea and he says we
should put a bell around the neck of the
cat because then each time it comes
close
you won&#39;t oh good idea but how could
they ever do that because my system eyes
are all so small and the cut is so large
oh they say we should cooperate together
because only then we can bail the cat
and that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do a
ballon cat and I&#39;d like to show you two
examples how this collective of mice
basically because this is all what I&#39;m
presenting is all the teamwork of all of
us has done this so the first case I&#39;ll
be presenting is something obviously
very familiar in the Netherlands mh17
and the second case is the bombing of a
mosque in Syria now MH seen mh17 was
departing us far from here from Schiphol
Airport at this time for Malaysia Kuala
Lumpur when it disappeared from the
radar above eastern Ukraine and
immediately after that happened there
were a lot of theories what may have
happened to the plane and some said it
was shot down by Ukraine some said it
was shut down by Russia or they said it
was shot down by separatists fighting in
eastern Ukraine some even went that far
to say that bombs were planted on board
at Schiphol so people online started to
wondering okay who can we still trust
with the claims is it the Dutch
government is it the Russian government
this is the US Oh what can we find out
online this was a really important
picture in that investigation because
people said we&#39;re saying this was a
showing something very interesting over
here a Bach missile launcher which is a
anti-aircraft missile system and oh
sorry and we were wondering can we
figure out the exact location where this
photo was taken because if this was
indeed in the territory it&#39;s obviously a
very interesting photo now here is
actually this photo is asking us guess
where am I so we start looking for this
visual clues and the visual clue here is
the name of a shop because we can just
type the name of the shop into Google
and we find someone has been so kind to
list a wiki page of shops in towns in
eastern Ukraine the store s and it&#39;s
magazines Troy de ok we have a name
which corresponds to what we saw on the
image then we start googling further and
we see that there is a court document
related to this shop because there was
once a fight not relevant for an
investigation but this is open the
available information and it lists an
address so we can type the address into
Google Earth and we&#39;ll just fly to the
exact location
and in that way we can compare what we
see on the ground image with what we see
on the satellites
that&#39;s confirming a location what is
even more important so we could tend
locals for example local reporters to
the exact same scene to take a picture
from we thought it was taken here and
I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going wrong so
basically we try to compare that
location if you look at this image
somebody took a picture at the exact
same site of where the photo was taken
if you make an overlay as you can see
you can see where the book was standing
so we could confirm the location but
we&#39;re also very interested in was
determining a rough estimate of time
when was the picture taken so since very
long time ago we have those sundials
right not a sundial but like we
basically use the shadow to determine
well to give an impression of time
because the shadow changes when the sun
is shining obviously so nowadays there
is a tool called Sun Kok and it allows
you if you know the exact location to
see how shadow changes during the day so
we were able to determine the time of
the day as well when the photo was taken
now this is a small piece puzzle piece
but you have to imagine in the 21st
century there&#39;s so many people with
mobile phones and especially if there&#39;s
military equipment driving by people are
taking photos of it people are taking
videos of it and they&#39;re uploading it to
social media to YouTube to Facebook to
VIP contact them so this is an example
of one of such awesome pieces but there
was way more like for example this video
where we can see a similar convoy
perhaps even the same driving and this
way we&#39;re able to map where this book
anti-aircraft missile system was
traveling through separatist health
eastern Ukraine before mh17 was shot
down so we had a clear indication ok
this may have been something to do it
was one of the theories why am i take
over by what mh17 was shot down at the
same time there is this information war
going on and this is a satellite image
presented by the Russian Ministry of
Defence four days after mh17 was shot
down and I would like to pull this like
a kind of Poland Power moment of Russia
remember
for the Iraq war they presented
satellite imagery at the UN you look
Saddam has weapons of mass destruction
yeah what you gonna do if you see this
satellite image this is like yeah must
be true because how can we check what&#39;s
on the satellite image well nowadays
everybody can check it and that&#39;s what
we try to do here as well because what
did the Russian units of Defense say
this is 14th of July 2014 three days
before I met 17 was shot down and I say
look this is a Ukrainian military base
and there&#39;s a buk missile launcher
standing there now we have a satellite
imagery of the 17th of July the day that
I met 17 was shot down it&#39;s not that
well obviously there&#39;s very interesting
information we don&#39;t care what the
outcome is
we just want to fact-check stuff maybe
they&#39;re right maybe this this is the one
we&#39;ve been tracking right but then we
started ok can we date those images so
we start looking on open source
satellite imagery for example available
through Google Earth and we compare them
with the dates and what we see here in
the top corner is this stretch of trees
right this is 14th of July if we go to
open source imagery of the 17th of July
we can see there no trees there ok it
could be that in 3 days that they cut
down all the trees could be but if we
start listing all the open source
satellite image of that location we can
see that on the second 17 and 21st there
were no trees standing at that location
so how on earth is is possible that on
the Russian Minister of Defense imagery
on the 14th of July there&#39;s suddenly
three standing there and this was one
indication that they presented during
this press conference four days after
the aircraft was shot down misstated
satellite imagery this has nothing to do
with those days this was from way before
those images so this only created more
interested investigating okay can we
track where this baktun came from
because of his aquiline came from this
base but there was one problem look at
this video look how many similar
vehicles are on deep load is here on the
back of trucks how could we be sure that
we&#39;re tracing the right vehicle in the
area so my colleague at Belen CAD came
up with an idea with the side-skirts
fingerprint it&#39;s basically comparing
above the the the wheels there is this
side skirt and it damages along the way
it&#39;s being driven along the way it&#39;s
being used so we build a database of all
the BOK anti-aircraft missiles that were
being spotted on social media images in
the area just to be sure were tracing
the right vehicle and in that way we
were able to trace the vehicle also
across the border going back in time so
these are digital footsteps of a
anti-aircraft missile June 25 June 24
and it ended at June 23 around the city
called Kursk so we thought okay maybe
maybe there is a anti-aircraft Brigade
stationed there and there was you could
tap it into Google and there is and
surprise surprise they&#39;re active on
social media they have a social media
page and there were so kind to post a
list of attendances of people that are
in certain units so we just typed those
two names into social media you find the
social media profiles now this is not
interesting photo but I also post
pictures of the military convoys giving
more open source information and
sometimes we didn&#39;t even have to
geolocate it because they would post in
front of the pictures where they&#39;re
traveling through this is so much open
source information that we could make a
solid case that mh17 was shot down by
this buk missile launcher which was
supplied by Russia to separatists this
is not to say it&#39;s not a smoking gun we
don&#39;t know what happened inside the
vehicle we don&#39;t know who traveled
inside but we have been able to identify
the people that were responsible for
this unit and even for this specific
vehicle now obviously all those names
are here anonymized but this information
we have been we gave to the joint
investigative team which is led by the
dutch authorities about the dutch police
and obviously well everybody who&#39;s been
following this has seen that this is
indeed has been confirmed the things we
found by the enjoyed investigative team
this really shows the strength of what
you can do from behind your laptop due
to figuring out what the facts are but i
want to show you another example and
that&#39;s the example how sometimes an
investigation just starts we have a
social media post here and it says there
has been an airstrike happening on a
mosque in syria
okay sure we have this claim there were
more people talking about it okay it was
Russia that bombed the mosque and then
you see those headlines showing up in
international media at least 42 death in
Russian raids on Aleppo mosque
would be easy to investigate Russia
again right we just saw before how
sometimes they&#39;re a little bit lousy
with the social media but what we always
do and that&#39;s what I say and I want to
stress again we don&#39;t care what the
outcome is we just won&#39;t investigate can
we confirm an airstrike took place can
we confirm it was done by Russia and can
we confirm it was a mosque well starting
at looking at social media images posted
from that site we also saw this image
and this doesn&#39;t look like a weapon
remnant of a Russian missile because
this is in Latin script and most Russian
weapons have Cyrillic script and
actually if we compare it to one of the
most famous missiles of the US the
Hellfire means we can see that the label
looks very similar so this started a
very long investigation and actually the
US admitted they struck the mosque they
admitted they struck the mosque or sorry
they admitted they struck this location
but they denied it was a mosque so we
could relocate it again and so forth
this is open source imagery but the US
was denying that they struck a mosque
they said explicitly they did instructed
strike this mosque I can&#39;t we don&#39;t care
what if it was a mosque or not would you
want to investigate what&#39;s the mosque or
just random meeting all as they said in
this statement released by CENTCOM from
the Pentagon
so we communicated with human right
watch and forensic architecture and we
all started investigations and shared
our findings and we all the three of us
based on open source imagery and based
on human right watching testimonies we
could only reach one conclusion and was
it this building that was targeted which
we see here was simply a very large
mosque on the construction so what we
did is basically get all this
information together all this open
source material from the site and try to
figure out okay how did this incident
evolve in space and time and by that
means forensic architect to build a 3d
model of the model putting all those
puzzle pieces on that just to get a
better impression what was this building
being useful so we can see here for
example a very large bomb crater and we
can see how this event evolved in space
and time
so these were two large bomb craters
consistent with 500-pound bombs each so
this is they evaporated the whole north
part of the building but we also found
footage from before the strike and this
is very important because people were
saying oh they just said it was a mosque
after the air strike but then this image
can actually see on top of the building
the advance speaker for example used for
the call to prayer what we can also see
is a sign of the mosque entrance showing
it was in the site even a better kitab
mosque also a footage from inside
showing more images that basically
everything points about it being a
mosque so we challenged the Pentagon and
again they said no okay fair enough you
didn&#39;t investigation but it&#39;s not a
mosque you just don&#39;t have the
intelligence the Intel we have well it&#39;s
fair enough it&#39;s right but based on
these kind of images we had to stick to
a conclusion is simply there&#39;s even a
measure up which shows the direction to
Mecca why you have to pray
well the Pentagon did start an internal
investigation and after a few weeks they
had to admit that they were wrong and
they indeed struck a large mosque
complex so this to me really showed the
power of these kind of investigations
you&#39;re able to challenge one of the most
powerful if not the most powerful
Ministry of Defense this is just one
example of an airstrike of thousands one
was looking at this on a daily basis is
Syria in Iraq and the larger the circle
the more airstrikes and the more we
think civilian casualties and it&#39;s just
too much to investigate well having that
set I hope I have could have shown you a
little bit of how the group of mice
works together from around borders from
around the world from different
professions but only using a laptop and
an internet connection thank you
[Applause]
you
