alright how&#39;s everyone doing today well
I&#39;d like to start and thank each and
every one of you for coming out today
and before we get started I&#39;d like to
make a special dedication to someone who
passed away recently my uncle who truly
demonstrated what it takes to persevere
you are not good enough you will never
make it you should just give up
we&#39;ve all heard these words in one form
or another in times of difficulty
sometimes from others and other times
from our self but the true difference
isn&#39;t the degree or severity of our
circumstances but rather in what we
choose to do when faced with life&#39;s
challenges what are that means to give
up or to persevere today if you&#39;ll allow
me to I&#39;d like to share three personal
experiences of hardships I&#39;d faced that
made me decide I wanted to be someone
who chooses to persevere and with
whatever you&#39;re going through whatever
you&#39;ve been through and whatever you may
face tomorrow
I hope there&#39;s something you can take
away from my message now let me get a
show of hands how many of you have heard
of Stockton all right that&#39;s more than I
practiced to count well for those of you
who don&#39;t know about Stockton or if the
picture doesn&#39;t peen itself
Stockton was dubbed the second most
dangerous city in California known for
its skyrocketing gang violence plethora
foreclosure rates and very limited
opportunities especially those
concerning advancing into higher
education or entering the job market but
for many people like me and my loved
ones this was home and this hardship is
important to me in particular because it
taught me that no matter how limited my
resources may seem that I am NOT defined
north nor
affected by my circumstances and I&#39;ll
never forget that might the day that my
life took a shift on an ordinary
Saturday afternoon I was laundry
shopping at the mall when I happened to
bump into my former middle school
teacher Miss Smith Miss Smith and I were
catching up on our daily lives when she
later on informed me that she took on a
new role at a local high school called
middle college middle college she
explained was the program geared to give
high school students the opportunity to
take community college courses to
advance into university she urged me to
apply however naturally I was hesitant
at first after all I wanted nothing to
do with Stockton let alone be tied down
to it for another four years however
four years down the line I not only
graduated with my high school diploma
thank goodness but six associate degrees
that allowed me to graduate University a
whole year early now this may or may not
be significant to some of you but for
those of you who have grown up in
disadvantaged communities filled with
negativity and resistance to change
getting into university was a huge
milestone in creating a change in our
lives and I invite you whatever
situation that may seem impossible to
consider seeing every opportunity
big or small which leads to my next
hardship I was bright-eyed and
bushy-tailed upon entering University
little did I know I was about to get
rejected left to right by various
recruiters at my first University career
fair as the freshmen here&#39;s what it
looked like these recruiters told me to
come back when I was older or had more
experience and I hated them and for
those of you who have faced rejection
you probably hate recruiters too
actually let me get a show of hands how
many of you are willing to admit that
you hate recruiters that&#39;s okay because
Google search seems to agree
well the funny thing is I now work for
recruiting and I love it anyways after
months and months of disgruntled this I
decided to use my negative energy and
harness it to do something productive so
as I was going through yet another
generically ridden rejection email from
a recruiter that I read
dear blah blah blah thank you for
applying a blah blah blah position I
forced my hand to hover over the reply
button instead of yet again deleting the
email and contemplated what to do
instead of yet again deleting the email
and what I did was something so simple
that I was astounded by the magnitude of
its results and this simple advice is
what I continuously advise my peers
today who see career guidance and it&#39;s
to communicate
I asked recruiters what can I do to
improve my resume or what skills and
make me a good candidate for your
position and three is down the line with
accumulated advice from various
recruiters in different industries I
walked across my university stage with
three full-time offers from
distinguished companies now I say this
not to boast but to inform you that a
lot of these milestones do come at a
cost and I invite you with whatever
situation you may be in that may seem
impossible to consider being creative
and as I inch toward my last hardship I
like to ask that you all close your eyes
and envision a hardship you&#39;re going
through right this very moment even if
it&#39;s my talk and how it makes you feel
because this is real and to be honest as
I talk to you today I&#39;m still figuring
this out because it&#39;s adjustment it&#39;s
moving from city to city across the
state across the coast for better
opportunities and I&#39;d like to pause to
commend each and every one of you for
going here and far to pursue your dreams
because as glamorizing as it seems to be
moving around so frequently it can be
terrifying at times adjusting to new
jobs new friends new cultures
it truly is the art of being comfortable
in such an uncomfortable space seeking
opportunities adjusting to change and
seeing failure as a means for growth and
although I&#39;ve met awesome people
throughout this journey
the most important relationship iPhone
was the relationship I built with myself
for most and so I invite you with
whatever transitions you&#39;ll face in life
to consider starting inwardly and see
how that will change your outward world
and as I come to a conclusion with my
talk I&#39;d like to summarize with
characteristics of people who persevered
with diagrams the first diagram is of a
person who tends to not persevere people
who tend to not persevere tend to have
what you call a fixed mindset they find
success at point X in getting over their
hardship and are content at that point
however consequently they don&#39;t tend to
see other and anticipated hardships to
come along in life people who do
persevere in contrast have what you call
an open mindset these individuals find
success not getting over their hardships
but going through all hardships knowing
that life doesn&#39;t get any easier we just
become more adaptable to hardships the
more we encounter them after all
hardships are fair hardships don&#39;t
discriminate and hardships are
inevitable meaning no matter who you are
what your status is or what you do
you&#39;re likely to face hardships in your
life and with that they say that we are
the average of the three people we hang
out with the most so surround yourself
with scholars with optimists and with
dreamers and see how that will transform
your life and be those people to others
as well because after all you are more
than enough you will go so far and you
should never give up thank you
[Applause]
