hi my name is Jessica Ressler and I&#39;m an
experiential and immersive creative
director so what that means is that I
constantly have to explain to people&#39;s
moms what I actually do but the best way
for me to describe my job is that my
living is predicated on coming up with
new ideas in design and marketing that
have never been done before my passion
isn&#39;t showing people how to look at
something new through the lens of time
and space and experience design and
often when I&#39;m super lucky I get to help
work out larger issues like this one the
music economy has completely shifted
leaving musicians in a place where they
have to figure out how to become their
own art directors sustained life on tour
and function as though there are many
startups advertisers these guys are only
marketing to about half the country or
less right now because they are fixated
on the major markets this doesn&#39;t even
necessarily make sense anymore in the
digital world that we&#39;re living in
thriving towns need arts and culture
design movements cool people cool things
all of this stuff to continue to sustain
and grow so we invented outpost and it&#39;s
never been done before
and it addresses all of these things in
one simple concept outpost is a
sophisticated rest stop for musicians on
tour think about it like the 7-eleven
meets the Soho House in emerging towns
all throughout the u.s. at outpost we
invite artists to come into our brand
supported store and take absolutely
whatever they want for free we seriously
tell them to go crazy and at times were
like just act like you&#39;re looting us get
wild in there so you might ask yourself
why is that important to this project
well because we&#39;re creating an
experience and the experience of being
treated like a boss is awesome and
motivating so we thought a lot about
what outposts needed to have to support
musician related creativity so inside of
each space artists can
this lay down tracks relaxed hangout
with awesome musicians and humans and
also produce content we&#39;ve spoken with
tons of musicians and what we&#39;ve really
learned is that their life on tour is
super fun but also really tough because
in their words there is certain shit you
just cannot do in a van or tour bus one
of the things we often hear is feel like
a human
so that&#39;s extreme and the other one is
laundry outposts helps to thank
passionate people for doing passionate
things we are asking artists to take so
that they can give because those that
have been considered are the ones that
give back we&#39;re asking the most creative
people to be part of the conversation
between thriving towns and growing
brands and we&#39;ve committed ourselves to
only working with the type of brands
that support progress community and
wellness there are businesses that focus
on profit and there are businesses that
focus on profit people and purpose and
we want to align ourselves with those
type of brands not just because we&#39;re
being altruistic but people vote with
their dollars and we want to be a part
of a culture that is creating meaningful
influence especially because brands are
some of the only philanthropist left for
musicians today but it&#39;s important that
they understand the power and the
responsibility of what that means what
it doesn&#39;t mean is forcing binds and
forcing obligations what it does mean is
coming up with reasons to speak about
one another favorably and the same goes
for our presence inside of each outpost
city this is our outpost in El Paso
Texas an outpost has been designed to be
about placemaking so that we are part of
a city and not tone-deaf out-of-towners
we are taking our responsibilities of
coming into a town and trying to develop
a growing movement seriously so how are
we doing since we&#39;ve opened outpost in
we&#39;ve had a hundred and eighty-nine
artists come through our locations we&#39;ve
saved them a hundred and sixty-three
thousand dollars on touring supplies and
amenities and they have shared their
experience with 2.7 million fans and
we&#39;re scaling by the end of this year we
are hoping to have eight hundred artists
through our spots and next year we&#39;re
gearing up to have 3,000 artists and
growing the benefit to the brands that
we&#39;re working with is not only that we
are connecting them to the most
awesomely talented content developers in
the entire world but the authenticity of
meeting those people at the most
passionate point in their career we&#39;re
hitting artists at their upswing and
we&#39;re introducing to them to brands when
it matters most when they really need it
through this model we are proving that
the side of the road is as good as the
end emerging towns have the power to
create the next Sunset Strip in 1969 or
the next saint barks in the Bowery in
the 1980s this kind of thing is not
going to happen again in an LA or in New
York City because those cities have the
types of trajectories that have priced
out experimental creativity I live in
New York City and I often refer to it as
living inside of the Museum of New York
City you can tell the kind of culture
that we used to have but what you&#39;re
gonna find is a lot more buffed out
graffiti and a lot less artist lofts
than there used to be so we are banking
on the people that are making culture
inside of an El Paso Texas or an Asbury
Park New Jersey or in Asheville North
Carolina to deliver to the world the
next Jim Morrison or Patti Smith and as
we open outposts across the nation our
goal is to create a sisterhood effect
among cities if our teams at outposts
can provide a connectivity and provide
familiarity through our string of
resources and locations then we can make
those distances and differences smaller
each day we want to be part of a
measurable effect
creating hubs that produce progressive
thinking we are creating a fan club for
the futuristic because progress is the
result of creativity thank you
