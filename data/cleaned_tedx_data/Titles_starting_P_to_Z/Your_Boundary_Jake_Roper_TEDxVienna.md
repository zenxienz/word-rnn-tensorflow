hi hi how are you lovely to see all of
you so today we&#39;re gonna go on a journey
called Jake&#39;s ass to central crisis it&#39;s
gonna be fantastic and in this
existential crisis that I have generally
always we&#39;re going to talk about the
digital self that version of us that we
like to share online because I think
instinctively we all like to share
ourselves right we like to have people
think that what we think is important
that we&#39;re valuable that we matter and
so about a week ago I was talking to the
lovely man who&#39;s just on stage Vlad and
I told him that I didn&#39;t want to be here
that I wasn&#39;t gonna come anymore and the
reason was I didn&#39;t think my idea was
worth spreading
so it was the opposite of what this
whole event is for I didn&#39;t think the
version of myself that was going to be
here today was the version that I wanted
to express that I thought lived up to
the idea of me in this setting but this
is a platform both figuratively and
literally it my mind is no different
than Twitter or snapchat or Instagram
YouTube etc and when we think about our
self hey there it is it&#39;s to me it
fractures depending on the platform that
you are on because every piece of social
media allows you to share yourself in a
different way
and so as we we fracture and split
across social media our self to me
becomes what I call ourselves with an F
not a V I don&#39;t know I&#39;m clever I&#39;m not
really but it it was this interesting
thought in my mind of who is this
version that I&#39;m going to be here verse
Who am I on YouTube versus Who am I in
real life Who am I on Twitter and
Instagram so on and so forth but let me
just back up one second hi I&#39;m Jake good
to see you
I also added an arrow just to really
emphasize that that&#39;s me but I guess if
you&#39;re looking at this angle the arrow
fits I didn&#39;t know where this is going
to be I should have done it at an angle
that&#39;s my bed but also if you look at
the arrow that&#39;s actually sorry a side
note if you cover the bottom of it just
look at the top it kind of looks like an
open book what a coincidence
because I&#39;m expressing myself
so I&#39;m kind of like an open book and I
don&#39;t know that&#39;s neat books are neat
this is all just uh I&#39;m gonna be honest
with you yesterday there was a speech
coach two of them they&#39;re lovely and
they said that an important thing to do
is connect with the audience so this was
me trying to seem organic and natural
and connect but it&#39;s all scripted and
planned nothing&#39;s real just to let you
know so where was I oh yeah I was
talking about myself which is wonderful
because I can do that very naturally and
organically so what do I do
well as as we heard in the introduction
I make videos on YouTube that&#39;s my most
well known for I have a channel called
vsauce3 and I talk about science I use
pop culture to explain whatever I&#39;m
curious about be it physics or chemistry
philosophy history anything and there I
am oh look at me
so young so new to the world so I like
to use things for example in this one
home alone fantastic film we haven&#39;t
seen it would highly recommend it&#39;s a
real treat for the eyes and in that
movie there&#39;s a lot of traps so I use
those traps to express momentum and
force and how objects transfer heat to
other objects and it&#39;s it&#39;s learning by
accident is what I like to think of it
as accidental learning you go in
thinking one thing you come out maybe
hopefully knowing something else and
it&#39;s very exciting and to me it&#39;s fun
stuff emphasized fun stuff by having on
the slide there we go
another example of this I also use video
games so for example fall out great game
highly recommend as well and in that we
can talk about nuclear war and radiation
and all the devastation that would
happen within that the terribleness of
it all and how would wipe out all of
humanity as we know it and everyone
that&#39;s left it&#39;s just miserable you know
fun stuff and YouTube is is my preferred
platform of choice it allows me to
express myself in a way that nothing
else does I can take these thoughts and
ideas that are in my head and I can
share them and hopefully it&#39;s fulfilling
enough for the audience and I&#39;ve been
lucky enough to find one but it isn&#39;t
the only social media that I use it&#39;s
just a part of me it isn&#39;t all of me
and this is me being honest with you
again everything&#39;s alive this is all
planned
literally the script is right
me right here and now it tells me to go
to the next slide so here we go so in
total that&#39;s the the number of people
that follow me on social media in total
cool but what does it mean nothing it
doesn&#39;t mean that my thoughts or
feelings are more valuable than yours or
anybody else&#39;s I&#39;m not more important
than anyone if anything what this means
to me
is that I&#39;m more self-conscious about
myself I don&#39;t really know why I share I
guess because I want approval and this
hopefully does it for me but there&#39;s
things that I don&#39;t really share that I
don&#39;t really talk about because we want
people to take care about us right
that&#39;s the reason that we we do these
things and it&#39;s me sharing hopefully
across all these platforms a piece of my
life that I think will get the best
reaction because social media is
curation we have thoughts every single
day you&#39;re thinking right now
I hope because they&#39;re not thinking then
you&#39;re probably in a coma which hey
thanks for buying a ticket and showing
up that&#39;s impressive and now that I
talked about thinking you&#39;re probably
thinking about thinking I&#39;m sorry oh
that&#39;s rough but you&#39;re not going to
tweet about it you&#39;re like oh I just
thought today no you&#39;re gonna take a
certain moment that happened during that
day you&#39;re gonna put that online that&#39;s
now you that&#39;s what you think people
care about and if they don&#39;t care about
it
you&#39;re not gonna post any more so you&#39;ve
curated your life for this version of
yourself that you think people want to
see on the internet a few examples of
this I really like examples as I used to
have a show called facts surgery which
was a stop-motion animation show because
I love stop-motion I think stop-motion
is one of the most beautiful ways to
express oneself in the form of animation
and video unfortunately other people
didn&#39;t particularly think that so I
stopped doing that show it
it ended it&#39;s gone now even though it&#39;s
still important to me in here and in
here but to an audience they didn&#39;t like
it so I&#39;m done another kind of stupid
example who here has like an Apple watch
or a SmartWatch whoo there&#39;s like five
of us we did it okay we can share each
other&#39;s heartbeats later
so I thought it was a really cool thing
when I got it I was like this is awesome
and I apologize you have to look at this
gift forever I didn&#39;t come prepared with
other slides but I made it I posted it
and then people were like no you&#39;re an
idiot
apples stupid you&#39;re stupid I respect
you less literally that was one of the
comments I got was that people don&#39;t
respected me less so I deleted that
Instagram post and I never talked about
Apple ever again and I don&#39;t post that
kind of stuff anymore it&#39;s changed hmm
so where to go from here I&#39;ll just give
you a second to read that and on to the
next what we post online in my mind is
supposed to be a reflection of us but I
think what it&#39;s become is a reflection
of what we want people to think that
we&#39;re like the ideal version of
ourselves it&#39;s personality by committee
we strip the things that we like and we
save them we hold on to them for later
to then share with others so what are we
left with I don&#39;t know but not something
that I particularly like I&#39;m just left
with these things that I don&#39;t really
want anymore because I&#39;ve given the
things that I do like to other people
that&#39;s theirs now yay you can have it
but it&#39;s little appetizer it&#39;s popcorn
it&#39;s not something real and so every
time I post every time I posted videos
like the happiest that I am you post it
like yes
is this endorphin that you get that
satisfaction and maybe you need that
because you want people to give you
value I&#39;m not sure but it&#39;s this high
that you chase and you keep doing it
until you get to the next one so when I
post a video like yeah I did it and then
the whole chain starts again and it just
keeps going and going also I feel like
I&#39;m very depressing I apologize you just
start out your mornings and Here I am
gonna big old rain cloud on your life
and I&#39;m awesome black what I have a
Nintendo symbol that&#39;s cool yay so for
me the larger that number grows that 4.1
million the less I feel like myself
because people are complex right I think
we all are we have thoughts and feelings
and emotions yet we only share a select
few of them and you can&#39;t
do that just on one platform you can&#39;t
just express yourself entirely in a
tweet or in a YouTube video or on a TEDx
stage there&#39;s there&#39;s more to you so I
think about things like this morning I
went to floss flossing is really good
for you by the way I would highly
recommend it but one thing that I love
about flossing is that it hurts and so
when I was flossing you know there&#39;s
always little bit of dried blood that
comes up on the floss after you&#39;re done
should I share that probably not but I
just did so live with it
here we are this is my world you exist
in this for the next five minutes two
minutes 45 seconds dang it I was way off
on my time but anyway do I want to share
that probably not and if I do and if
people don&#39;t like it the reaction I got
was tepid at best then I won&#39;t do that
again you&#39;re never gonna hear me talk
about dental floss for the rest of my
life but it is really good for you
please do it and sometimes I want now
we&#39;re getting really now I&#39;m saying how
loud it sounds very depressing sometimes
I want my digital life to disappear you
know just want to stop doing it just
take a break but then I get worried that
if I do that then I will no longer be
important or valuable that if I don&#39;t
post maybe I stop existing
it&#39;s like this this digital version of a
tree falls in the woods so now we get to
the point if we&#39;re doing an order in a
normal narrative act structure we had 1
2 3 right beginning middle and end where
I give you a conclusion something to
take away and you go yeah that was worth
the price of admission but I don&#39;t I
don&#39;t have that at all but I can tell
you things that I&#39;ve learned from this
whole experience this whole journey that
I&#39;ve spent with 6 years of living on the
internet and that is that reality to me
is another platform to share it&#39;s
another place where I can express myself
and what what have you come online is
more of a character that I play so an
example of this would be that I have a
really lovely girlfriend she&#39;s very cool
I think she&#39;s fantastic and I love her
to death she&#39;s dope as heck I don&#39;t know
if I&#39;m allowed to curse so we&#39;re using
heck heck haha and our relationship
exists between us we made a conscious
decision to not share our relay
chip on the internet she doesn&#39;t appear
in videos of mine we don&#39;t like snapchat
each other or whatever kids do these
days he says but he&#39;s also a young
whippersnapper and that exists between
us and our friends and so my social
circle in real life is much smaller than
my digital life but it still is
important but I don&#39;t have to filter it
through a wide net it&#39;s just mine and I
really like that it&#39;s important to me so
so go back to the beginning about why I
didn&#39;t want to be here I thought about
it a lot actually when I was talking to
Vlad on skype and I was like oh this is
actually quite fitting because I didn&#39;t
want to be here because I was scared of
sharing myself which hey here we are
but when it comes to sharing oneself I
think about it in the in the way that
it&#39;s really not don&#39;t the slides are for
humor
don&#39;t take them too seriously what I
think about true myself of these
platforms the hope is that even though I
am a character on this stage right now
this isn&#39;t the real me really it&#39;s a
version of myself but it isn&#39;t myself
that if I share enough of me in
different places across different
platforms in different ways that
hopefully they will come together they
will coalesce into myself that&#39;s all I
got thank you
[Applause]
