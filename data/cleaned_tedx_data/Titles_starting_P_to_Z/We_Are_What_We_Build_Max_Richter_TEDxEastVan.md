hello today&#39;s theme is human and I want
to talk a little bit about at the
beginning here about what humans are
made of as a species we&#39;ve been on the
planet for about three hundred thousand
years this is important because the
majority of that time we&#39;ve spent
outdoors surrounded by daylight fresh
air and natural materials in fact it&#39;s
only in the last 200 years that as a
species we&#39;ve begun to move to urban
centers and become indoor creatures
what&#39;s amazing is today the typical
North American spends 90% of our time
indoors what&#39;s also important about is
that if you look around this room and
realize we&#39;re surrounded by synthetic
materials our bodies are adapted for
natural materials natural conditions but
we surround ourselves with synthetic
materials and it&#39;s starting to affect us
so I wanted introduce the concept of
body burden first and this is the idea
that these synthetic materials that we
put into our buildings when when they
come into the space they&#39;re not fully
cured or they&#39;re still reacting and so
emissions come out of those materials or
they&#39;re not well bonded in small
portions come out and get into our space
and they get into our body through three
different ways the first is through
dermal contact through our skin the
second is through ingestion so if you
think about little toddlers calling it
on the floor and all the things they put
in their mouths but the most important
pathways through our lungs because all
those little parts of materials and the
gases get into our lungs and get
absorbed into our body and because our
body&#39;s not adapted for these new
synthetic materials they get stuck in
our body and our body has a difficult
time processing them and that&#39;s the idea
of the body burden if you look at this
slide think about it for a second what
could this possibly be an ingredient
list for maybe an industrial cleaner or
a snack food that&#39;ll stay fresh for
generations if we look at the ingredient
list of a human being
it starts with water that goes to
protein it goes to fat what we&#39;re
finding out is at the bottom of that
list it are all of these synthetic
materials this is my colleague Robin
Gunther and a few years ago she had her
body burden test
and to her shock her amazement she came
the test showed all of these different
substances in her body all of them
associated with toxic effects all of
them associated with negative health
effects I want to focus on six of them
and show you how this the things that we
surround ourselves with those synthetic
materials in our buildings are coming to
affect us so if you look around the
space that you&#39;re in right now if you
look at the carpet on the floor the
paint on the walls
maybe the fabric of the seat that you&#39;re
sitting on right now most of those
things are made from synthetic materials
you can imagine the insulation and the
walls all of these things are having
effects on us and the reason is is
because of all of these things that
we&#39;re adding to them that are not well
bonded they&#39;re coming out through gasses
or portions that are coming into the
space flame retardants
triclosan an antimicrobial VOCs volatile
organic chemicals the research is
showing that these sub synthetic
substances are associated with some very
serious health effects because they&#39;re
not bonded well and they&#39;re getting into
our systems and what happens with these
chemicals is when they&#39;re in their body
because they&#39;re often chemically close
to the hormones or the other chemicals
that are naturally in our body our body
thinks those are substituting for those
hormones so they&#39;re becoming endocrine
disrupters their developmental toxins if
you think about all the development we
go through our lives it&#39;s affecting the
normal process of our development most
worrying it&#39;s actually affecting our
ability to have children it&#39;s a
reproductive toxin so the most difficult
piece of news i want to give you today
is that even if you were to clean up
your lifestyle if you were to eat really
well if here to take care of yourself
the research is showing that we are all
born into this world with a body burden
when our mothers are pregnant the toxins
that our mothers are exposed to are
passing through the mother to the child
and the point I want to make is that no
matter what we do individually with our
lifestyles we are all in this
predicament together and it&#39;s only by
working together that we&#39;re going to
find a solution so there is very good
news our body this wonderful technology
that&#39;s been around 300,000 years is very
good at doing what we want it to do PC
a toxin that was agreed universally was
should be banned from use was banned in
1979 and you could see from the graph
after the ban the the amount of PCBs in
breast milk and the study of Swedish
mothers was reduced if we give our
bodies a chance it will do great work
a similar more recent study out of
California this is for flame retardants
in mothers in California in the breast
milk in 2006 this flame retardant was
banned for use in California and you can
see the result again given a chance our
bodies will help us remove the toxins
from our body so you might think well we
can rely on regulation this is we can
advocate for regulation we can ban these
chemicals and pesticides and things that
are were coming across I want to point
out asbestos at the top line the risks
around asbestos were first identified in
the 1970s it took 19 years for asbestos
to be banned for use in buildings in
fact it&#39;s not until 2018 that we will
have a comprehensive ban in Canada so my
point is we can&#39;t wait for a regulation
we can advocate but we can&#39;t wait for it
if we want to be sure about our health I
show you this slide to make a point
about information I lost a bet to a
colleague at work and I had to eat this
spicy chicken donut sandwich it was
pretty good but here&#39;s the thing if you
wanted to find out if it was healthy
what could you do that&#39;s really easy you
can go online quick service restaurants
are required to provide the calorie
counts for their products consumer
demand got them to publish the
ingredients so you can make a choice if
you want to eat it once once a week once
a day that&#39;s your choice to make
we can&#39;t do the same thing with building
materials for me that&#39;s not ok we need
access to the information to make the
best choices about the materials that we
expose ourselves to so I want to tell
you a story about a girl in 2012 and in
Mississippi a 16 year old girl her name
was Sarah Cavanaugh she liked to drink
Gatorade she looked at the back of the
Gatorade
label at the bottom she noticed
something called brominated vegetable
oil and she wondered what is that so she
went online she realized that bromine is
also used in the flame retardants and
she started asking more questions why is
this in Gatorade and what she ended up
doing is she put a petition online to
ask Gatorade and Powerade to remove this
father&#39;s rep from their recipes
she got 70,000 signatures and the result
was these two very large companies
changed their recipes so this is what we
can do if we all put our voices together
I&#39;m an architect I work every day to
design and specify materials and make
healthy buildings but today we need your
help and that&#39;s what I&#39;m coming to ask
you for we need you to ask this simple
question what is it made of when you go
to buy paint ask the question what is it
made of when they&#39;re putting new carpet
in your office ask this question what is
it made of when they&#39;re putting new
floors in your child&#39;s school ask this
question what is it made of in August
2014 Perth Australia
passengers were boarding with train on
their way to work the fellow in the gray
shirt and the grey hat was boarding
somehow he got his leg wedged between
the edge of the platform and the Train
he was in an impossible position if they
move the Train so he could move his leg
out he would be hurt passengers started
gathering remember this is rush hour
people are piling onto the platform even
though he was in the difficult situation
everyone is affected by his his
predicament and this is the same thing
with materials even if you or someone
you don&#39;t know don&#39;t suffer from asthma
we are all affected by the body burden
that&#39;s in our bodies and there&#39;s a great
lesson here the passengers join together
and somehow they did the impossible they
pushed together and they tilted the
Train enough that he could pull his
train out from between the platform and
the Train he he walked away relatively
unharmed the passengers got on their way
to work but it this is the idea that
working together we can make the
impossible happen and this is the big
thing we need your help we work all the
time to produce buildings that are
healthy but we need you to
amplify our voices and ask this question
when I first started in 2006 looking
into this issue and realizing how we are
surrounded and using toxic materials to
make buildings I didn&#39;t think it was
possible to build anything let alone
build anything that&#39;s beautiful
inspiring there was nothing that we
could point to to to tell you there&#39;s a
beautiful inspiring alternative that you
can choose I want to show you a few
projects today that show you that
there&#39;s a future waiting for us that&#39;s
healthy this is the visitor center at
the Van Deusen Botanical Gardens here in
Vancouver it&#39;s got a beautiful building
beautiful forms inspired by a flower and
we worked hard to remove toxic materials
out of this building and won awards and
certifications so you can go there and
you can look and marvel at the sort of
the beauty of the building but also
breathe deeply knowing that it&#39;s a
healthy space to be in this is the
Center for interactive research on
sustainability at the University of
British Columbia this is a pioneering
building for sustainable design in
Canada another one that we worked on to
remove toxic materials people love being
in this building it&#39;s full of fresh air
it&#39;s full of daylight it&#39;s full of
natural materials and it&#39;s free of all
of those materials that are causing us
concern we&#39;re working on research now
with leading academics to prove that
buildings can make us healthy because
we&#39;ve heard stories from the occupants
that these working in these buildings
are having a great effect on their life
we talked to one woman when she before
she moved into this building her lung
capacity was at 47% she could only work
three days a week because she had to go
to get therapy the other two days a week
within six months of moving into this
building her lung capacity was at 92%
she works a full-time job and she is
happier than she&#39;s ever been we think
this is the future that we can create
healthy buildings but we need your help
we need you to amplify our voice and ask
this question we need you to be those
passengers pushing the train we need you
to be those 70,000 people demanding the
change in the recipe because there is a
healthy feature out there if we just ask
thank you
you
