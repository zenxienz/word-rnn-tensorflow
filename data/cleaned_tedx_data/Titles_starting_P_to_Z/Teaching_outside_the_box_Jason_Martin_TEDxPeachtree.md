children are gifted with curiosity
regardless of where they live or who
their parents are if we give them the
opportunity children will showcase their
talents and imagination with even the
most simple of things like a cardboard
box I&#39;ve seen kids design castles invent
new games with only a box and I
experienced this firsthand when I walked
inside the classroom as a kindergarten
teacher that was completely terrified
but ultimately transformed as it lay the
foundation for how I teach all kids even
adults
you see kindergarten teachers get
immediate and unfiltered feedback if we
lecture too long or we have kids sit
behind a desk all day if we don&#39;t move
around five-year-olds will immediately
let you know so we get down on the floor
with them we go outside to play we build
things together what if every grade and
not just kindergarten could look like
this most teachers would agree that if
we give that every child can thrive if
we give them the right stimuli and
environment but to do that we need to
think outside the box and imagine a
place where even simple cardboard can
become a bridge to new ways to teach and
learn take a look at this picture what
do you say said classroom you&#39;re
absolutely right this one though is from
the 19th century
and think about all the things that have
happened in the past 150 years
electricity automobile telephone walking
on the moon uber but classrooms and what
goes on inside of them have not changed
and for far too many youth this place is
not a place for creativity
for imagination for thinking outside the
box I believe we can do something about
that too often kids fail in school
because we assess things that they just
do not care about nor see the relevance
in but in the early grades failure is
authentic if a block tower that a group
of kids builds collapses it&#39;s not like
they failed blocks 101 instead there&#39;s
usually a real reason that kids can
graphs
maybe the foundation wasn&#39;t far enough
for the height or maybe their team
needed to work together better share
talk to each other without arguing
recently Google education commissioned
the Economist to answer a simple
question what are the skills of the
future and after talking with teachers
and academics and business leaders three
things top that list problem-solving
team working communication we educators
call these 21st century skills and by
far the best way to teach these skills
is to embed them naturally into the
school day so I find it as one of the
great ironies of public education that
corporations are looking for skills and
mindsets that are fostered better with
blocks than by textbooks and Center eyes
tests I believe schools can do a better
job to teach kids of all grades to learn
these skills unfortunately too often
this is predicted by where you live or
the school you go to and I experienced
this firsthand like many of the kids
that I taught I was raised by a single
mother
off and on welfare and by the third
grade when I was not thriving with her
she did what I think is one of the
hardest things possible when she picked
me up one night and drove me far away to
my dad&#39;s house and told me to stay here
because
here was an opportunity for me to
succeed my dad lived on a farm which was
a world away from the apartment building
that I was used to and on the farm I got
my hands dirty I worked as part of a
team tackled some real problems I
thrived and I was lucky but we can&#39;t
rely on luck and this experience drove
me to create something new here in
Atlanta I imagined what it would look
like if we can bring opportunities to
youth without asking families to move
I created steam truck and Innovation Lab
on wheels and for those of you not
familiar with the latest in education
acronyms steam stands for science
technology engineering arts and math and
since 2013 this truck has brought tools
and technology and local talent directly
to schools and we work with youth most
underrepresented in STEM careers when we
park it right outside the classroom door
kids just walk outside to begin to
tinker and build things I honed working
on a farm but improved upon as a
kindergarten teacher I want to make sure
that the next inventor or scientist is
not lost to us simply because they
didn&#39;t have access to tools and
technologies now it&#39;s true as kids start
to get a little older playing with
blocks may not work but kids often
younger than when most folks here would
feel comfortable with can use real tools
there&#39;s a sense of responsibility they
earn when they use real tools and when
we go to schools we love it when we can
tackle a real problem and this is go
healthy which i think is the nation&#39;s
first mobile cart that gamma Phi&#39;s the
collection of healthy food kids design
and built this themselves
that first prototype was at a simple
cardboard before this the final version
out of wood and metal their vision to
bring though healthy around school
putting healthy food inside to then give
to others it&#39;s an amazing innovation
that shows that kids can tackle real
problems if we just give them the
opportunity and when we give them
authentic opportunities kids begin to
learn there&#39;s 21st century skills like
problem-solving team working
communication all right now for the head
fake up to now I have shown you pictures
of kids and they inspire me and their
stories I shared are true and yes to
close opportunity gaps you need programs
like what we do but you also need to
catalyze transformation and the reality
is is that kids don&#39;t need to change
they don&#39;t they just need more
opportunity the true value of this work
or any work with a similar mission is to
build a skills and mindsets of the one
thing that has the biggest impact on
student achievement teachers often it&#39;s
adults even with the very best of
intentions that need the biggest shift
in mindset and if I can&#39;t get every
single teacher to teach kindergarten for
a year before they go off to teach
Shakespeare or algebra well then I&#39;ll
drive a steam truck and park it outside
their classroom door and show them what
happens when you get your hands dirty
and you make something here are two
teachers doing exactly that as they use
a relatively safe and simple tool one
never found inside the classroom and
they&#39;re making much cooler name tags
than the stickers on their shirt
nametags it&#39;s pretty simple but in the
process it&#39;s the adults not just the
kids who begin to build the skills and
confidence needed to use something other
than a textbook
to begin to think outside the box this
all started with a 1988 Chevy p30 that I
bought for less than $15,000 and in an
amazing and ironic twist this truck was
a government vehicle used in the county
next door to where I was born and for
almost 30 years
it drove around a city helping adults
fill out their unemployment papers
adults who could not get a job would
walk inside this truck and hope for the
best so I like to imagine that if
steamed truck
could talk it would say that it&#39;s very
best years of its life are now working
to ensure that this next generation can
thrive and support in the transformation
of teachers and teaching eliminating
inequities catalyzing transformation I
just simply put it on wheels enclosing
my call to action for those in the
audience or listening is that regardless
if you&#39;re ready for retirement or spent
time doing something other than
education reform it&#39;s not too late
this is not a Waiting for Superman
moment now sure if I had a thousand
trucks across this nation which I would
love
my pair will put a serious dent in the
opportunity to divide but there&#39;s talent
around every single school in this
nation and I&#39;m looking at it now if you
have a skill a trade or a hobby the rise
of the maker movement and STEM education
in almost every single school in this
nation gives us all the opportunity
really the responsibility to drive
yourself to the nearest school and give
kids and their teachers an opportunity
to get their hands dirty and make
something together I want to leave you
with a challenge steam truck was just an
idea on paper before I got that first
truck and that first year I only served
75 kids in a single teacher three and a
half years later with six vehicles we
have driven up and down the East Coast
and we&#39;ve served hundreds of teachers
and over 6,000 kids now if a former
kindergarten teacher can do that what
could we do together it&#39;s time to think
outside the box thank you
