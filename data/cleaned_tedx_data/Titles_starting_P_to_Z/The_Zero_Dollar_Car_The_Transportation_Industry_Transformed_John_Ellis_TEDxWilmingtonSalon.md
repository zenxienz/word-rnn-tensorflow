a few years ago a number of my friends
and I got together and formed a think
tank to explore the question what
happens when what happens when human
beings stop driving what happens when
the price of electricity Falls to nearly
zero what happens when the model of
individually owned automobiles
disappears forever today I want to share
with you my exploration of the question
what could happen when the zero dollar
economy intersects with transportation
so what is the zero dollar economy to
answer that question we have to go back
in time a little over 300 years the
years 1704 Boston newsletter is
published and it has the first ever paid
for advertisement 25 years later
benjamin frankly launches the
Pennsylvania Gazette in Philadelphia and
his publication carries pages of this
thing called new advertisements and thus
is born the industry concept of
advertising subsidizing the production
of a product in this case the newspaper
and the information product industry
iterated on this over the next 300 years
September 1998 Larry Page and Sergey
Brin found Google with the objective to
organize the seemingly infinite amount
of information on the web and they are
so successful and the execution of this
mission that PC magazine at the time
says Google has the almost uncanny knack
for delivering relevant results they
later then named Google the top search
engine in their 100 top list to visit in
October of 2000 goggle launches AdWords
a self-service Pro
to allow advertisers to purchase
personalized affordable keyword
advertising that would appear on the
google.com search results initially
started as a beta with 350 companies it
quickly became a success because it
delivered not only instantaneous results
but instantaneous ads that allowed for
exceptionally targeted keyword analysis
and gave most importantly advertisers
the necessary tools to understand the
effectiveness of their advertising today
Google build products that my colleague
Richard Windsor describes as digital
life services these include browsers
email clients productivity Suites the
mobile ecosystem called Android and they
do this because they operate as a large
ecosystem business and for large
ecosystem business the more services you
can offer the less likely it is that
your users are going to leave or switch
competitors Google makes money by
advertising and by creating tools for
others for us to advertise last year
they made over 90 billion dollars mainly
because of their incredible insights
into their users insights that allowed
Google to help the advertiser serve up
the right ad to the right person at the
right time and for those of us here who
operate on the web we know what that&#39;s
like if you have a bad golf swing like
me you go online and you ask for help
and immediately on the left hand side
are countless articles showing you how
to improve your golf swing well on the
right hand side are a number of ads
targeted for caps or coaches in my area
this is incredible Google offers an
amazing suite of products that help
people
their daily lives and they do not ask
for a dollar what they ask for is you
the monthly active user and for Google
every user is a different value it
depends on what you use how you use it
where you use it when you use it and how
often you use it as an example some
research we did we were able to discover
for a very specific family of four
outside of Chicago who is fully
committed fully on fully in to the
Google product portfolio that they
represented just a bit more than five
thousand dollars in terms of yearly
advertising sales for Google this is
incredible however because it is an
exchange of goods eyeballs and time for
product it is incorrect to refer to this
product or products as free and so I
coined the term zero dollar product
should be noted that Google is not the
only company delivering zero dollar
products many of our modern platforms
that we use today also do that we have
Facebook Pinterest whatsapp Twitter so
the zero dollar economy is the
collection of companies that serve up
zero dollar products and consumers have
responded in amazing fashion just this
past summer Facebook announced it had
two billion monthly active users Google
estimates with all the products what&#39;s
going on that they have over four
billion monthly active users so what is
this actually though have to do with
transportation imagine your automotive
head unit that&#39;s screen it sits right
off to the right hand side in the US on
your dashboard right now every car has
one and it&#39;s different it looks
different it behaves different and often
it is difficult to use so Google comes
along and convinces most
of the automotive companies to adopt the
familiar look and feel and applications
that are present in the Android
smartphone that you use each and every
day they call that offering Android auto
and the offer is for free and this has
shown to be incredible for people who
are beginning to interact with these
highly highly technical cars to be able
to use something as simple as what we&#39;ve
used on our phone each and every day
has proven to be remarkable but the
question is who wins will the driver be
able to recover any financial activity
when Google takes this data and sells it
for additional advertising who makes
money on the data and what data is there
in a modern day car there are over a
hundred sensors that are deployed to
make the drive safer to make the car
more comfortable and to make the time
spent in the cabin more convenient these
sensors include sensors to deploy the
airbags
such as to help with braking sensors to
help with traction control and sensors
to help with ride stability this is an
amazing set of sensors and we continue
to add more sensors sensors that will
today help us relieve us of the burden
of driving including adaptive cruise
control lane keeping assistance blind
spot monitoring and pretty soon full
autonomy as these sensors are deployed
and generates significant amounts of
data it is tech companies that
understand more than anyone that this
information both in and out of the car
about the car about the passengers are
about the ride it is information that
can be sold to cities municipalities and
companies this data is in fact
exceptionally valuable and for a company
like Google who understands how to
process it harvest it analyze it when
coupled with location preferences and
intentions this data is
unbelievably valuable so how my google
take such data and build for their
portfolio a zero dollar product imagine
that you have your forty thousand dollar
car the car of your dreams ready to go
you&#39;re at the dealership and you want to
leave as you&#39;re going through the
process you&#39;re offered the opportunity
to sell six sensors GPS rain windshield
wiper headlights status traction control
and barometer now these six sensors when
combined actually provides very accurate
weather data around your car and who
might be interested in that well it
turns out that there is the National
Oceanic Atmospheric Administration
otherwise known as NOAA they&#39;re a
department within the US Department of
Commerce and they are charged with
monitoring weather including forecasting
the terrible and tragic storms that we
most recently saw here in the United
States NOAA today seeks federal funding
to build weather stations but why not
buy the data from the cars where the
people are so let&#39;s say that you agree
and you&#39;re willing and you&#39;re willing to
accept that you sell the data for a
three thousand dollar lifetime price
gone done you&#39;re good
that car is now thirty seven thousand
dollars and every car that we now have
also had something called suspension
controls to make the ride really smooth
but imagine if we captured the data when
the ride wasn&#39;t so smooth possibly
suggesting maintenance issues and
repairs the governments and companies
charged with maintaining our roadways
would be exceptionally interested in
that and might in fact be willing to buy
it so let&#39;s say that we&#39;re able to
negotiate the sale price of that for two
thousand dollars the car is now forty
minus three minus two thirty five
thousand dollars every car in modern
times now has a microphone it was
designed to keep her hands on the wheel
and eyes on the road but imagine if we
gave access
- somebody imagine what they could do
with that to help us as we try and
figure out where to go or who&#39;s in the
car what&#39;s being said how many people
what gender what&#39;s that worth so imagine
if we agree that we&#39;ll give access to
our microphone for let&#39;s say a total
lifetime price of $5,000 we&#39;ve now taken
the car down to $30,000 and we haven&#39;t
even gotten through most of the sensors
we still have sensors with cameras and
we understand speed
why not bundle them and sell them off
for road systems in traffic congestion
for another two thousand dollars and on
and on it goes
as we can continue to contemplate the
creation and packaging of sensors in the
vehicle we can begin to take the price
of that car down and let&#39;s not even get
started on what&#39;s going to happen when
the car is autonomous the value of this
data could be equal to or in excess of
the sale price of the car the car then
in essence is zero the zero dollar car
now more importantly than the zero
dollar car as cool as that may be is
that we actually have a contract for the
establishment of the sale of our data
now that is very cool but why stop at
just the car there is data everywhere
why not the zero dollar bus ride where
are you going why you&#39;re going we&#39;ll
give you a free ride
why not the zero dollar uber who are you
with what do you talk about we&#39;ll give
you a zero dollar uber ride why not zero
dollar insurance for every product and
service that exists in the
transportation industry we can envision
the application of the zero dollar
economy and this is why companies like
Amazon Alibaba Baidu Facebook Google
Microsoft are working so diligently to
get their digital voice assistance into
the transportation industry starting
with the car the transportation data
Bonanza is too big and too important to
miss out now
on the sidelines our durable goods
companies and municipalities who sit
there and look Google and their
ecosystem peers take advantage of and
master the world of big data and they
ask themselves questions how can we get
into this game how can we collect and
monetize data how do we play in an
economy where people are increasingly
saying data is the new oil after years
of longing along comes smart cities and
the Internet of Things and we suddenly
see an explosion of sensors being
deployed into previously inert objects
allowing the physical world to wake up
from stop signs to stop lights from
bridges to roadways trucks buses cars
depots trains we are giving voice to the
physical world to talk to us and those
durable good companies and those
municipalities are on the sidelines no
more as these entities go and gather
data we start hearing them say things
like we won&#39;t sell that data we cannot
sell that data that data is our
customers it is against our citizens to
sell that data and onward and onward but
where this gets really really
interesting is what is the difference
between what is technically possible and
what is legally possible is the only
thing that&#39;s protecting our personal
data a policy on the behavior of a city
a municipality or a company or instead
is there a technical constraint this is
important for our privacy because guess
what it is far easier to change the laws
of data protection than it is the laws
of science unfortunately and in the vast
majority of cases the only thing that
stands between us and the cell of our
personal data is in fact
a policy a human-created
thing that can be easily overturned and
oh what temptation there will be at
least one world religion holds and
maintains that the human condition
exists as it does because we cannot say
no to temptation if we could not say no
to the Apple how can we possibly expect
it to be say no to the mounds of data
that can be sold for millions of dollars
and so I stand here before you and
suggest that what we should do is accept
the fact that humans will be tempted to
sell data and they will succumb to that
temptation and therefore we should stop
trying to regulate privacy and rather
treat it as a product so going back now
to that story about the car and data we
go back to the story of the car and data
and we say what if we had been able to
say no what if instead of saying yes we
had said no what would have happened in
essence we would have been saying our
data is not for sale we would have been
buying privacy and we had ventured into
a product contract that embedded and
battled that imagine how if we set this
for all of our products for all of the
zero dollar products we will say no
every time the zero dollar product is
offered a full price that&#39;s offered and
if a consumer chooses the full price
guess what they&#39;re buying privacy
privacy as a product by trading
privacy&#39;s of product we actually
increase their chances of creating the
framework to support and protect our
consumer data by treating privacy as a
product we actually create and are able
to use the laws that exist today for
product liability and product management
by treating privacy as a product we
raise it to the appropriate level for
all companies to treat the creation of
product with the respect that it&#39;s due
Sir Isaac Newton said if I stand on the
show sorry Sir Isaac Newton said if I
see further is because I stand on the
shoulders of giants for me those giants
are excuse me those giants are julian
wrangler and matt Cohen who are creating
the language and the technology that
exists behind something called the
personal data economy
and I applaud them but what the personal
data economy misses is a strong
conversation about privacy as a product
so my call to action for you today when
you see a zero dollar product or a zero
dollar service offered by a municipality
or company ask for the full price offer
only by you me us asking for the full
price offer will we have a chance of
succeeding in establishing privacy as a
product I ask the question at the time
what is in fact the intersection of
Transportation and the zero dollar
economy and the answer is privacy
privacy as a product is in fact the
answer for the intersection all we need
to do is dream a little and ask for it
thank you
