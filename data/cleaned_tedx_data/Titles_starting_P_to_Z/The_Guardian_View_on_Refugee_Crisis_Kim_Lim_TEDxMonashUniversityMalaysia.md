I want to talk to you about the the very
major crisis that is happening in not
just Malaysia but around the world I
want to talk to you about refugees so
how many of you know what refugees are
like really know what refugees are
cannot see so few of you all right
so so refugees I need to put everyone on
the same page okay so refugees are
people they have to leave their country
due to persecution war or conflicts they
are happening back in their country
because it&#39;s just not safe enough to
stay there anymore and they had to seek
refuge from another country to live a
better life so I want to introduce you
to a boy this boy he is five years old
he&#39;s from Yemen he&#39;s a boy from our one
of our closest family and he is a very
hot very hardworking very diligent very
dedicated full of energy boy and very
helpful and kind
his name is pizza so picture came from
Myanmar with his family and
unfortunately picture is can I have the
next like this
unfortunately picture is one of the 65
million refugees they are currently in
the world out of these 65 million
refugees only 1% guests resettle when I
get talked about resettlement it means
that when they seek refuge from another
country they have to register themselves
as a refugee and then get an opportunity
to resettle to another country to become
the citizen there and have all the
rights that they&#39;re supposed to have and
so what happens to the rest of the 99%
so the rest of the 99% either end up can
I the next at peace can either end up in
back in a country where it&#39;s still water
on this is Syria who is constantly
bombing until today this is Afghanistan
Taliban&#39;s are there no rights for
education no rights for
goes to be outside or they end up in
refugee camps places like Jordan where
there is no electricity no education no
food and very very less supplements for
them so pizza and his family came to
Malaysia and became one of the hundred
and fifty thousand registered refugees
but because our country didn&#39;t signed in
1951 UN Refugee Convention so there are
no refugee camps in Malaysia so there&#39;s
no support for them we they don&#39;t have a
legal rights to work and they don&#39;t have
access students like pizza won&#39;t have
access to quality education so going
that&#39;s a whole overview of the refugee
crisis that is happening in Malaysia and
I want to tell you a bit about the work
that I do
this is last week this is the whole
concert team I told you that I&#39;ll
conduct refugee choirs so we actually
organized fun concerts for their
education this was one of it is it was
all the students there with our
committees and we presented a musical
choir of how there are refugee lies from
Myanmar all the way to Malaysia so these
kids did an amazing job presenting to
300 to 500 people and everyone almost
cried on that day and I want to
introduce you to the next two of my
other co-founders so this is me right so
this is Sweden Sweden is an accountant
finance background who actually worked
in love yridian finance department
before and this is Suzanne she&#39;s a
psychology graduate once she she she she
was part of the the future project team
so how it happened with is there four
years ago we were all volunteering in a
refugee Learning Centre I&#39;m a musician
so I teach music that&#39;s all I know that
so
and two years after a lot of our kids
started dropping out of school like from
20 it drops to 18 and then eventually it
drops to five so if I were to teach a
choir I cannot teach five kids singing
if we like I cannot even present
anything on stage so after that we
realized this problem so we went home
visitation trying to understand why the
kids are dropping out school so we asked
the parents why are you not sending our
kids to school and they mentioned that
well they have to come back and support
the family some of the needs to go out
and work for odd jobs to sustain the
family especially parents that faces
accidents or any any physical conditions
that is not available to perform work so
the students or the kids have to go back
and sustain the family so it was really
shocking for us why is it that way and
only we find out that we&#39;ve seen the
refugee community because they&#39;re not
allowed to work so a lot of them cannot
even find probably decent decent salary
to sustain their lives in Malaysia we
were really really worried about the
situation and we thought that to
ourselves there must be something that
we can do and at the same time all of
them can cope because even my younger
student can cook for his whole family
Wow I&#39;m 27 years old I don&#39;t even cook
anything so it was really it was really
you know that they thought of us okay
maybe we can use these cooking skills
create a platform for them and be able
to let them showcase their food to
Malaysians like you all and so the
picture project came about and we named
we named the the the the picture project
after after pizza the next next night
please okay
it&#39;s after picture so that is feature
right from the first photo you you you
saw and then this is our first family
her name is Kanu we her name is not
gonna we call her canoe canoe in Ching
it means mother because we want to
create a bond within all families and
and make them realize that we&#39;re not
doing this
for profit we&#39;re doing this to assist
people like you and this was where we
started off we started off with
packagings like that because we have no
idea I told you what we do right right
I&#39;m a musician yes you&#39;re listening so
yeah so three of us has no business
background we don&#39;t know anything about
FMB we don&#39;t know how to do anything so
this is what we become and you don&#39;t all
do anything what you do you Google a--
so whatever
also you google from how to how to
package and can I have the previous
slide please it&#39;s from how you package
stuff to how how does memories eat and
things everything be just Google and we
try and this is our first sales looks
very depressing but yes it&#39;s alpha sales
so from there we we started
experimenting and then we got into an
accelerator program last year April and
we started expanding to Afghanistan to
Palestine to Syria to Iraq and today we
have 10 families cooking fire
from five different countries cooking
with us and we we went on of course we
went on to improve our our our services
so that more more more customers can
actually purchase from us with insured
food quality hygiene and safety and
knowing that everything is well well
well done from the refugees so this this
is how we package ourselves this is how
we did our photography and I the next
night and then we went on to Google
again to Google how to do catering
services how to decorate tables like
this and and and how to how to even set
up a shopping dish we don&#39;t even know
this was called shopping dish so we&#39;ve
done everything on ourselves and and
every we created a whole service and and
and experience for our customers and of
course assisting the refugees at the
same time so today we&#39;re actually in our
15 or 16 month already we have 10
families from 5 different countries with
us so being more than 40,000 packs of
food are gaining a revenue of nearly a
million for the past past one and a half
year and half of them actually goes back
to the families that cook and sustain
their lives in Malaysia serving people
big brands that are in Kuala Lumpur so a
lot of people asked us why why do you do
this
why tree of you to fear cannot eat do is
it our musician cannot earn money that&#39;s
not true so I want to tell you a story
about a family that is really really
really close to our heart and that he is
the reason why we are doing what we are
doing today so this guy his name is aza
this is his wife this is his monster
that&#39;s a monster it&#39;s really a monster
so three of them came from Syria and the
moment they realized that and sure all
of you know what&#39;s happening in Syria
right now with all the social media and
things so they they came from Syria the
moment they decided that they have to
leave Syria is when his wife have was
sending this monster that wasn&#39;t an
Angus was one year one year o to the
hospital to get a vaccination because he
was just one yo and on the way to the
hospital of blown a bomb flew by hit on
the 22 story condominium everyone and
everything perished inside at that
moment the wife realized that the the
road towards the hospital is just too
dangerous we have to hit back so he she
took her 1 year over back to the home
only to realize the next day that every
kid they&#39;ve received a vaccination that
they all passed away because the
vaccination took too long to reach to
where they were and everything was
expired and they were really really
lucky they felt really lucky but they
know that Syria is not
a place to stay in anymore and so as I
saw of everything and trusted an agent
that actually promised him a good house
good living good job in Malaysia only
when they fly here to find out that
there is no rights to work and there is
no home to stay and everything he has to
restart again it was really really
devastating for him at that time he was
four years ago and he he had to use
social media like how we do today Google
Facebook and to to promote his food he
was a professional chef but in Syria so
he could use that media to actually
promote his food and get by day by day
until he met the future project so when
he met the picture project he became one
of the most famous kitchen in the
picture project everyone wants him
everyone says can I call can I can I use
those a can I can I can I I must have
such as kitchen ax okay so we he he made
a really good fortune for himself he
everything was really stable he worked
really hard from five packs to 200 packs
if it&#39;s 200 packs the next day he
doesn&#39;t sleep the whole night and he
knows that he understands the vision of
the picture project he knows that he has
to be really really professional because
if he is not professional all the
families are affected so he knows that
he has to be at the top notch and he is
always experimenting things with the
picture project to be able to move
forward and he got the really stable
life after that he was like ah I can go
here I can go there sometimes he was
taking some some festival or pictures
with for us until this February
unfortunate things happen where he got
into a sickness he got cancer and eaten
in Malaysia for a refugee to receive
treatment is really really hard because
of the prices because of the treatment
they get in hospitals so it was really
heartbreaking for us when knew that he
is happy hospitalised so our co-founder
Suzy
I drove 12 a.m. in the midnight bring
him to the hospital to actually get
hospitalized so he and he received a lot
of a lot of people supported him a lot
of people had his foot a lot of people
know who is as a so his many coffee was
all settled
but still we lose him in May in May 827
we lose data and we was not just a great
chef we lose a good brother we lose a
good friend with those a great family
and it was really really haunting for us
before he left he when he was bedridden
he said this I wanna cook chicken Monday
for whoever they are really in need
during Ramadan man at the master area
and he was bedridden he lose everything
he had to use all his savings to pay for
the medical fee he lose it second and
third time but he was thinking of other
people were like what are you thinking
and for everyone that is here that is so
privileged sitting in a Eichhorn room
listening to TED talks and things like
that
I want the how many poor people are
suffering that doesn&#39;t have what we have
right now and can we do better than
there right he has done so much can we
do better than that so that is why the
teacher project is holding on onto the
spirit and continue wanting to continue
to impact more and more families like
him everyone says that refugees they&#39;re
so dirty they are here to steal our jobs
they&#39;re here - I don&#39;t know
they&#39;re here to spread diseases how many
of you can say that here no they are
here because they have to and men on ten
of them if we ask them where do you want
to go they will tell you the same
everyone says the one thing I want to go
home but there is no home to go so
weather can we Malaysians build a home
for them here there is a question that
is why we are
doing what we&#39;re doing today so hello
people answers
how can I be part of this movement well
I&#39;m not really good I&#39;m not like Mother
Teresa I&#39;m not like Nelson Mandela I&#39;m
not like you know I&#39;m not like God I
cannot help everyone I have to help
myself first but how can you be you and
still make a change i we in the picture
project we don&#39;t always force people to
do something they&#39;re not good at and to
help people but how can you be you and
still make a change if you&#39;re an
architect student if you&#39;re a mass comm
student how can you use your skills to
make a change in this world it doesn&#39;t
have to be humanitarian cause our
environment are suffering too so how can
you use those skills that you are
studying right now to enrich the world
and save the world today this is me in
Manila speaking to 2,000 students 2,000
people from all over from ASEAN and two
days before my grandmother passed away
and I had to fly to Manila and the the
thing here is that I was a musician I
couldn&#39;t speak like how I&#39;m speaking
today to you I cannot I will freak out
and probably I&#39;m not steeped rambling a
bit but here is me talking to 2,000
people trying to make them change makers
trying to tell them that change is
possible and here we have probably a 200
people that can&#39;t be the ambassador of
that you right here can be the
ambassador of making a change so this is
a small symbolism of world peace here
this is all our family around six of
them for them are not inside this is a
small symbolism of war peace where we
don&#39;t look at races we don&#39;t look at
different backgrounds we don&#39;t look at
different religion but we all come
together and we know one thing if we do
what we&#39;re doing right here right it can
be expanded it
the microscope t can it can it can go
around the wall to spread world peace
and everyone single one of them knows
that can we all all here acknowledge
that too and if you see the most of them
are intrude on right they are actually
most things so how does three
co-founders Chinese that has all
different religion assisting Muslims to
gain a sustainable living in Malaysia
can I so yes so um I really want to give
back the question to you can we all
eliminate such discrimination such
judgmental comments such such
differences and all come together make a
change in this world
how can you be you and start making a
change today thank you very much
[Applause]
