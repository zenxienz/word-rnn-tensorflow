I was thinking I was about a year ago
and I was driving in my car and my
daughter was in the background and she&#39;s
11 and she said uh she said mom hold his
head
Mike Ted who she was you know Ted the
guy you&#39;re always talking about Ted like
how old is Ted I I don&#39;t know she goes
well he seems pretty old I don&#39;t think
we know it Ted and she said you and
daddy are always talking Ted said this
and Ted said that and when we were
talking about the bacteria Ted said what
if bacteria ruled your body and I was
like oh that Ted I said honey
Ted is an acronym it stands for
Technology Entertainment and design and
it&#39;s about people getting on stage and
sharing their thoughts and their
experiences and their adventures and
it&#39;s about trying to make the world a
better place it&#39;s jaw-dropping it&#39;s
amazing Mike heads not a person it&#39;s an
idea and she said wait what and that&#39;s
how we ended up here so hopefully today
we will hear some ideas that will make
you pause for perspective and if you&#39;re
11 years old you might say wait what
thank you
