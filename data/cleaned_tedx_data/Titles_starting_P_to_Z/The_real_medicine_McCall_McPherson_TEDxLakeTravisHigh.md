so when you ask a child what they want
to do when they grow up often the answer
is well I want to help people I want to
change the world right and logically our
train of thought takes us to the usual
professions of doctor teacher
firefighter or in my case physician
assistant and as a PA I I set out to
help people and to change people&#39;s lives
but what I found is that it took me
quite a few years of practicing medicine
to actually do that and I want to talk
to you today about my journey and I want
us to contemplate the question what if
we stopped thinking about changing the
world with our profession and we start
thinking about changing it with our
interactions in other words what if we
focus less on what we do and more on how
we do it
so I practice wildly interesting unique
and complicated medicine it&#39;s called
functional medicine often times patients
come to see me as a last resort and
rightfully so I don&#39;t take insurance
I make them fill out at least 35 pages
of intake questionnaires and we talk
about poop for three and a half minutes
the first time that we meet so you can
understand their reluctance but they
come to see me nonetheless because they
need help
because they want their lives back and I
like to think that I help them do that
and in fact often times people tell me
that I&#39;ve changed their life and every
once in a while someone will tell me
that I&#39;ve saved their life it&#39;s an honor
but what I found to be the core of these
people&#39;s recovery is the partnership
that we form along the way and that
partnership is based on a pretty strange
and simple thing and it&#39;s just
seeing each other as human I&#39;m here
today because I truly believe that I
make the most impact in medicine just by
recognizing the humanity of my patients
and life and medicine hasn&#39;t always been
this easy for me right when I was
offered a neurosurgery position before I
graduated my master&#39;s program I was
totally stoked by the end of this talk
you&#39;ll get a good bead on the fact that
I am a total brain nerd but pretty soon
thereafter I began to realize that
neurosurgery is one of the most
disheartening aspects of medicine a
close second only to oncology lives are
completely devastated in an instant by a
car crash or the diagnosis of a terminal
brain tumor I will never forget the look
on a husband&#39;s face while he was caring
for his wife who in an instant was
reverted to an infant like state after
the rupture of an aneurysm in her brain
of knowing what their future together
looked like and that he would never get
his wife back or rolling back a high
school student and homecoming came to
the o.r for his third surgery for a
glioblastoma which is the most deadly of
all brain tumors and carries a two-year
survival rate of less than 30% I felt
deeply for these people over time I
think I began to feel too deeply I
became depressed and anxious I found
myself fighting back tears just talking
with my patients and their families or
breaking down as soon as I made it out
of their hospital room at one point I
seriously considered foregoing being a
PA completely and picking up work in
construction if you don&#39;t believe me my
family&#39;s here tonight you can ask them
as a hundred and thirty pound woman who
by no means is a natural athlete and
after thoroughly assessing my genetics I
have the aerobic exercise potential
similar to that of a cat and I know I&#39;m
using that term loosely
and I don&#39;t actually mean The Frisky
kind I mean the really really lazy kind
so to give you a really good visual
picture of where my head was at I&#39;m
gonna reference the TED talk of bren√©
Brown and if you haven&#39;t seen it you
should really check it out because it&#39;s
pretty awesome I was having a breakdown
right or really I was probably having
like a breakdown so I had two options I
could distance myself my feelings and my
vulnerability from my patients stripped
them of their humanity in order for me
to cope or I could leave my neurosurgery
position and pursue an aspect of
medicine that would allow me to remain
passionate and able to recognize the
humanity of my patients or I guess the
third option is always construction so I
did just that and I don&#39;t mean the
construction I mean option two and I
worked towards a career that would let
me do that and it&#39;s benefited my
patients but the craziest thing is is
it&#39;s benefited me too and from this
simple concept I&#39;ve built a fulfilling
and successful career that I love and
that I believe truly helps people so
naturally as a person in medicine I rely
more heavily on research and data and I
tend to discount personal experience
right even if it&#39;s my own so naturally I
wanted to to do a study on my own
patients so I sent out a poll to
everyone and I asked them to anonymously
reply to quite a few questions but I was
only seeking the answer to one and that
was what has been the most therapeutic
component of treatment in your recovery
since becoming my patient right and the
results are pretty darn profound so the
mainstay of our entire medical system is
based solely on medications and
pharmaceuticals they are our
standard of care only 10% of my patients
attributed their recovery to medication
actually less than 10% but we&#39;ll be
generous right over 77% of them cited
that their recovery was due to the
simple fact that I treated them like a
fellow human being and front whoa right
so maybe that&#39;s just it
maybe the key to this thing called life
is just recognizing the humanity of
others
the long-standing undertone in medicine
has been to strip everyone of their
humanity
both the patient and the provider and
it&#39;s done it&#39;s incorporated into our
medical training itself and it&#39;s done so
that by the time we finish we are primed
to practice medicine effectively even
under the harshest of circumstances
often having been denied food water or
sleep right and you can see how
obviously this could be beneficial to
the patient but I think over and above
everything it creates a damaging
disconnect and I think it has long-term
consequences on the provider or the
physician who at this point in time has
one of if not the highest suicide rates
of any professional career in our
country this is the topic of an entirely
other TED talk right but what I want us
to recognize from this situation is that
this example of stripping one another of
our humanity is not unique to medicine
and in fact this can serve as a canary
in the coal mine of life so so serve as
the canary in the coal mine of life and
then can serve as the canary in the coal
mine of life
so let&#39;s circle back to our question
what if we stop thinking about making an
impact in a difference in changing this
world with our profession and we start
thinking about changing it with our
interactions luckily this trend in
stripping one another of our humanity is
being fought and resisted by individuals
and companies and when we experience and
encounter them it&#39;s refreshing to the
human spirit simply by virtue of them
recognizing ours so we see and feel this
when we fly Virgin Airlines who treats
us like people as opposed to cattle or
we use Amazon that puts us over profit
or when we engage in writers and
movement makers like New York Times best
seller Glennon Doyle Melton whose impact
in social justice is grounded in her
willingness to be honest even in the
most uncomfortable of situations right
so I think that we get well think about
it this way in a world of autopilot
authenticity and connection feel so good
so let&#39;s harness each other&#39;s humanity
in real life we don&#39;t need to be a
neurosurgeon or a firefighter to make an
impact clearly the results of my own
data prove that I make the most
difference in the lives of my patients
simply by recognizing their humanity see
I think we get caught up in the idea of
big things that we&#39;ve convinced
ourselves that we have to do something
profound in order to make an impact when
in reality it&#39;s in the accumulation of
the everyday moments of our lives that
we can truly affect people so I want to
get a little esoteric and scientific on
you for
few minutes so buckle up as we move
through our days our weeks our lives
were all tethered to something and this
is just the concept thing or idea that&#39;s
always in the back of our mind so it can
be our work it can be our kids or the
fact that we&#39;re a parent or the idea
that we&#39;re not good enough that we will
never be blank enough I think we can all
fill in our own blanks right that the
world is good or the world is bad you
see the constant undertone of our mind
creates our lens and how we see the
world and what I call our tether so what
if collectively we started to change the
dialogue in our mind that creates the
framework for how we see the world we&#39;re
gonna dig into a little neuroscience so
stay with me okay so our brains are a
trainable organ but they like to take
the path of least resistance they&#39;re
lazy I mean who doesn&#39;t like to take the
path of least resistance that one is
simply the one we use most commonly and
what I call our tether but by
purposefully training a new pathway just
by repeatedly using it we can change the
way that we think our tether and thereby
the way that we see the world so I&#39;d
love to take credit for this entire well
yes so what if we change our tether from
whatever it is now to a tether to
maintain the viewpoint of the humanity
of others right the person driving
insane speeds down our residential Road
or the patient or the PA the bullied or
the bully the refugee or the person
working behind the Starbucks counter
what if we took ourselves off of
autopilot and engage in our interactions
with everyone as if they were another
human being and while I&#39;d love to take
credit for this entire concept what I&#39;m
actually talking about at its core is
simple and well researched what I&#39;m
asking us to do is to use mindfulness in
our interactions with others and
mindfulness really isn&#39;t quite as
magical as we&#39;d all like to think you
see all it is is focusing on whatever
we&#39;re doing right now not reliving the
past or anticipating the future
Harvard put out a study a couple years
ago that looked at the effects of 27
minutes of mindfulness each day for
eight weeks and they measure their
outcomes by way of taking an MRI scan of
participants brains before and after the
study and what they found was is at the
end of only two months participants
brains had statistically significantly
grown and what was showing up on that
MRI scan was their new tether and it
changes the way that our brain
structurally looks but it also changes
the way that we process information and
how we see the world so I don&#39;t want to
over complicate this because I have a
tendency to do that but this is
something that we can all use together
because the most incredible thing that I
found is that it&#39;s contagious and it&#39;s
simple right when we encounter someone
all we really need to do to accomplish
this is stop the dialogue in our mind
focus on the person in front of us make
eye contact right connect with them in
an authentic human way and in order to
accomplish any of this right for the
love we all have to put down our phones
but my hope in sharing this with you
today is that we could take this idea
work to reform our own tethers and in
earn make a positive impact on this
world simply from being able to maintain
the viewpoint of the humanity of others
thank you
[Applause]
