and yeah this is me but actually a
younger version of me like around four
years ago I was studying architecture
and yeah was that small four years ago I
was studying architecture and yeah I
didn&#39;t think about the future too much
enjoying life traveling around a lot and
I really loved being in the mountains
hiking and stuff and also loved being at
the sea and still loved it and I really
do love diving there is just a little
problem because I do have a diving
license and I really enjoy being
underwater but I&#39;m afraid of fishes
it&#39;s a truce and actually I did this
diving license and the lessons to get
rid of the fear but yeah sometimes it
works sometimes not and in four years
ago in the last year of my studies I
went diving with a friend and it was a
beautiful die for these little fellows
and I watched them they were quite far
away so everything was good was a
comfortable life and suddenly something
was touching my feet and I was like
completely shocked and thought oh my god
that&#39;s a huge big shark trying to eat me
but of course it was not a shark it was
actually just a plastic bag and I was
confused because I thought why Sir
plastic inside the water and ya didn&#39;t
know what to what to do and I watched
around and actually there were more
plastic around me than fishes little
pieces little bottles stuff like that it
was yeah a little bit frightened so I
went back home and couldn&#39;t stop think
about this topic and I always had this
plastic back in my mind and even it was
it was not dangerous for me because it
was not a shark it&#39;s dangerous for all
these little fellows and there&#39;s a lot
of research and try to get more
information because a couple of years
ago it was not that much in the news
editors today so I got a lot of
information while doing research and
it&#39;s a huge problem and every year 6.5
million tons of plastic are getting into
our oceans by rivers and stuff like that
and if you count that it&#39;s like seven
hundred thirty tons an hour which are
just like in the picture getting into
the water which is quite yeah shocking
and frightening the worst thing is that
all the fishes all these little nice
fellows are eating the plastic and it&#39;s
getting into their muscles changing the
DNA and finally even we are eating the
plastic because we the humans are at the
end of the food chain and when we eat
plastic fishes we also eat plastic which
is kind of not that cool and yeah we
don&#39;t like it so in the main question I
asked myself why is there no solution I
mean we are like intelligent people and
there should be a reason solution for
that and the question is the answer for
this question is quite simple because
it&#39;s really really difficult there is
not just the huge plastic bags floating
in the water but also little pieces
cause all these bags and plastic bottles
are breaking down to little little
pieces and you cannot just take a net
and collect them because if you do that
you collect all the fishes or the plants
on all the tea creatures and that
doesn&#39;t make any sense actually so I try
to think about what can we do how can we
get it out of the water and I&#39;m not the
first person thinking about how to clean
water so yeah normally you get huge
plants and they are working the main
part of a sewage plant is a huge bezel
it&#39;s called sedimentation basin the
water is getting inside getting calmed
down and the sediment is going to the
ground and the clean water is just going
further and if you take this principle
and you just turn it upside down because
in the oceans there is these little
particles accumulating
in such cold ocean gyres it&#39;s because of
the currents around the world and this
plastic is not floating on the surface
but in the four first forty meters and
if you could find a solution to calm
down the oceans in special points then
the plastic which has a lower density
than water can go up to the surface and
as I&#39;m an architect I tried something
with architecture so I build in platform
which is like 400 meters wide quite big
which is floating on positioned and
anchoring inside these ocean gyres and
there is a canal system underneath the
surface so it&#39;s going down to 40 meters
where the covering of the plastic
particles is the highest and the water
is going inside inside this canal system
and because of the form the water is
getting calm down and all these little
plastic particles can go up with their
own density because there are no
currents no winds no stuff which turns
around around you can just go with a
natural draft up to the surface
and this is it this is actually yeah
this huge platform looking a little bit
like a spaceship not going to Mars
actually and the water is going inside
and because of this form it&#39;s getting
calm down and in the end of the platform
all the plastic is coming to this
surface so we can just skim it from the
surface and don&#39;t need any net filter
system complicated stuff like that and
all the little fellows the fishes sea
creatures they can just pass through so
there&#39;s no net no nothing to stop them
and the next great question was what to
do with the ocean plastic because
actually it&#39;s not waste waste is yeah
you can just burn it but the ocean
plastic is actually a huge resource and
I think we should use it so my idea so
I&#39;m an architect no chemicals Lucas or
biologist but my idea was to get if I it
because when you gasify it
and you get a synthetic gas out of it
which is made of hydrogen and co2 the
hydrogen you can put into burning cells
so you get energy to get the platform
run and the co2 you can put into algae
cultures and there&#39;s one special species
I&#39;m not a biologist but I did kind of a
lot of research and there&#39;s one species
when you put sulfur out of it while
growing it&#39;s producing hydrogen not
oxygen like normally so you get even
more energy to get the platform run and
if you take the biomass of the aggies
you can make new algae plastics out of
it
so finally you get like more or less a
circle you put the old plastic out of
the water get energy a new plastic which
is biodegradable and doesn&#39;t harm the
ocean anymore so this was it this was
actually my master thesis in
architecture nothing to do that much was
architecture in the end just how it
looks like and I called it Pacific
rabbit screening Pacific because of the
North Pacific Garbage Patch because
that&#39;s a huge the biggest of the ocean
gyres and yeah normally with
Massachusetts you got your degree happy
life can start the normal way is you
take it put it in a box forget about it
that&#39;s the normal way but somehow that
didn&#39;t happen there were a lot of people
talking to me saying hey cool idea
that&#39;s great
do you think about if it&#39;s feasible did
you ever do to a calculation or whatever
I was like yeah I&#39;m an architect
I cannot count that or do a calculation
and stuff so I started to talk to people
and I started to do to ask questions who
can help me how can we prove it we need
a calculation who can help me and
finally let&#39;s do something because
probably the idea is not bad bad so I
really found some people engineers and
university
and the main question was does a concept
work and they did a calculation not me
and the first results were like yes good
work and I was quite happy like cool
little architecture student had a great
idea and finally it&#39;s probably working
so we decided to go on with the idea to
go on with the proof and yeah we I got a
team and our team is in these days
really growing and growing growing and
in the beginning of the year we decided
to found an NGO and the NGO is called
Pacific our screening and we are a kind
of a young motivated team we are all
volunteers working on this topic and we
want to yeah we want to do something and
we want to build it and our intention is
not to to get money for that because
there is not a business plan behind this
idea first of all it&#39;s like caring about
our planet and to do something because
actually I like this planet and I don&#39;t
want to move to another one where I have
to put a goldfish bowl on my head every
time when I lift the door and I would
like even my kids sometimes probably to
live on this planet and not on another
so what we want to do is to build a
feasible technology it doesn&#39;t make any
sense to build a spaceship probably in a
couple of years then I&#39;m quite happy but
the first thing is to build a prototype
so we want to build little little models
which we can put into rivers or river
mouths so we can collect the plastic
before it&#39;s entering the oceans like
being more effective and yeah collecting
it before it&#39;s harming the oceans and
that&#39;s what we are working on right now
we&#39;re trying to get research funds for
that and here trying to get a model to
put it into a kennel and to test it and
our motivation is to stay on these
planets and to yeah to keep this planet
life because the the chance to go to
another planets is possible probably in
a couple of years
but there are no rivers no forests no
nothing all things I love when I do
travelling they are not on Mars
so our intention is we want to save our
oceans and finally we want to save our
very very beautiful planet
