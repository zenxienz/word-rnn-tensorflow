adieu kimochi ng comfortable with my
lessons Watney only sediba young
protection of the unknown
he won&#39;t fear tortures anymore
also in crayon not her reality but was
actually my little sister talking her
name is Surya she&#39;s 13 years old and she
managed to put simple words on what the
world really needs and it&#39;s not fluffy
idealism this is a real need I remember
myself when I was 13 years old that was
the time where I was the most insecure
growing up in Norway I felt like I
didn&#39;t really belong and I felt like I
didn&#39;t fit in anywhere and with the
group of kids that I was growing up with
I was bullied and that made me feel like
no matter how much I tried I wasn&#39;t good
enough and then I would go to ads and
magazines to compare myself and I was
horrible and imagine in my time we
didn&#39;t even have social media so
thinking of the pressure that exists
today and thinking of the cyberbullying
I know is happening my heart really goes
out to anyone that is experiencing that
in the world at the moment there are
more than 7 billion people more than
half of them are under 30 actually one
in four between 15 and 29 it makes a
total of eight point one point eight
billion people there has never been as
many young people on the planet and this
opens an amazing window of opportunity
actually 90% of these young people live
in the
in countries and the potential for
economic and social progress is amazing
however we need to secure that kids and
teenagers get the best shot at a decent
life those years are the most formative
most decisive most vulnerable years
education has one of the biggest impacts
on young people&#39;s lives and the numbers
are alarming because not many get
through secondary school and the
relevance and quality of the education
also varies a lot 75 million young
people are unemployed at the moment
around the world and speaking of economy
we&#39;ve entered this fourth Industrial
Revolution also called the tech
revolution and we&#39;re hearing all these
stories about how half of the dog market
will be taken over by robots and that
one-third of the jobs that will be
available don&#39;t even exist right now so
this means that use is gonna undergo
rapid change and we need to prepare for
this change we truly are at the defining
moment in history when it comes to
protecting people protecting the
environment and also having a good
economy remember what my little sister
said in the beginning
well world leaders actually agree with
her in 2015 they were all gathered at
the UN and they came together with a
common plan for the planet for 2030 with
17 goals for sustainable development and
they agreed that we are going to solve
things like gender equality education
health poverty and many more and it&#39;s
great it&#39;s great that we&#39;re committed to
these goals but the huge gap between the
reality that we&#39;re in and what we wish
for says it all
and if we&#39;re gonna have any
chance at getting to these goals there
needs to be a shift in power right now
we rely on institutions on politics on
corporations on organizations and that&#39;s
great we need their involvement but the
bigger shift we need is that you
understand how much power you have to
change things if I go back to what I was
telling you about my story when I was
growing up I left out an element that
was very important and that&#39;s the fact
that I was lucky to have my parents for
instance and a very special teacher that
saw me and validated me and believed in
me and that helped me get through
secondary school it helped me understand
that I could have an impact and it made
me go for my dreams and I believe that
this doesn&#39;t only apply to me this
applies to all of you and this is one of
the reasons why I started something
called inter bridge which educates young
people to solve social issues and then
we call them impact agents and what I&#39;m
saying now is that you don&#39;t need to be
an entrepreneur you don&#39;t necessarily
need to be a politician to have social
change is that you need to understand
how much impact you actually have on
yourself on your surroundings and in
society by everyday choices the food you
eat the clothes you wear the energy you
use and maybe perhaps who you&#39;re gonna
vote for and the thing is that there is
magic that happens when young people are
offered this self-awareness when we work
with youth we have this one premise and
it&#39;s that they need to want to be active
locally but we put them together
and we make sure that they&#39;re very
different we make sure that they&#39;re from
different geographical parts that they
have different socioeconomic backgrounds
and perhaps also different cultural
backgrounds and what they keep on
telling us is
that they learn from each other and they
are so happy to meet people that usually
they wouldn&#39;t meet and this create
changes and I want to share some
examples with you we had this one
session on social media and how it&#39;s
important to put on a bullshit filter
when you&#39;re on social media and this
young boy 13 year old said at the end of
the session that he finally was going to
promised himself that he wasn&#39;t going to
put so much effort on trying to get
muscles at 13 and that he wanted to just
accept himself for who he was and I
think that this is really important
because it&#39;s where it starts I&#39;m also
really touched by the story of Aisha
that is 16 years old she started off
being very very shy and throughout she
started gaining confidence and ended up
being in a City Hall telling
decision-makers what she thought was
right for her city and now she&#39;s a
student leader and she writes her
opinions on national newspaper I&#39;m also
really humbled by the story of the
friendship between Emily that is 18 year
old and Ally that 16 year old Emily is a
vegan girl and Ally comes from a
Pakistani family and they have meat as
part of their diet conversations between
the two made Ali realize certain aspects
about the meat industry so he started
looking more into it and he became
really environmentally engaged he went
back to his mom had a serious talk and
asked her to have meat free days the mom
agreed and the mom has also talked to
other moms and this is how this
friendship sparked social change it also
means that you are the ones that
actually can do something to solve the
issues like I said before the world is
undergoing a shift we&#39;re moving from
non-sustainable non-inclusive towards
sustainable and inclusive and with the
rapid changes that are happening I
believe that
youth is the most important resource
that we have your opinions and insights
are actually needed I see this in my
work with with public sector and private
sector they are wondering what is the
youth thinking what what are they about
what do they want and I&#39;m going to
confess something my best advisors are
the young people the impact agents in
interpret I have a fail final final
message for you which is that whatever
you&#39;re going through right now doesn&#39;t
define you forever
believe me and you have immense
potential so I hope you can activate it
and you aren&#39;t just the future you are
the present you&#39;re shaping it every day
with your choices and you&#39;re creating
our common future every day locally and
globally you matter youth matters thank
you
