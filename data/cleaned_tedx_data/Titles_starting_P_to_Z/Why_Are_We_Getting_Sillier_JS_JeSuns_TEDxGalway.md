we are gonna play with no further delay
the microphone is fully done but no
problem show me some filters okay I&#39;m
gonna be running the atmosphere no

trying to feel the sensations no
modulation okay 2 8 8 9 times I&#39;m going
to tell you thank you that show me the
next one please I hope the result is
right if it is please give me some noise
okay thank you I will raise my voice

is a crazy quest so okay I&#39;m not on your
nest that guy who used to travel I don&#39;t
really know who is I&#39;m here okay my
course is complicated please hey yo
check he&#39;s thinking keep going like that
I cannot be blocked that&#39;s I mean you
blow in the city okay
don&#39;t say what a pity I&#39;m trying to do
this and all that hide hide wow man this
is dropping that&#39;s good anyway I&#39;m just
a guy from my neighborhood trying to
solve equations try to solve the real
deal I don&#39;t know it&#39;s gonna be all my
years I think it&#39;s to 100 to 9 that&#39;s
fine
okay
[Music]
so yes multitasking I do it from time to
time in my shows even though I&#39;m a man
always involving tasks that I have
mastered I would like to point out
however that I do not encourage people
to do it on a regular basis since has
been proven it&#39;s not recommendable so
okay so let&#39;s go back to the beginning
you may be wondering how do I do it yes
it&#39;s a question that I have been asked
many times and my reply is I&#39;m not a
mathematician I did not even go to
college I&#39;m just a neighborhood guy who
accepts challenges no matter what the
difficulty is so I&#39;m an improviser and
more than three years ago I was part of
a show mixing music theater rap and
other skills and we were looking for new
ideas to offer new spectacle so I came
up with this multitasking thing and
started multiplying two-digit numbers by
one such sixty nine times seven
something like that while freestyling
and yeah I&#39;m going to be honest with you
it was not easy at first I was often
disappointed in the quality of my rhymes
and results were not always right yeah
don&#39;t laugh that&#39;s right so after doing
many and many and many I got better and
then I thought why not go to three
digits like that one and surprisingly
for me I could do it so then I thought
why not go to five digits to seven
digits to solve square roots solve
different types of Rubik&#39;s cubes I&#39;m
actually 2 weeks ago I solve this friend
they&#39;re the biggest Rubik&#39;s Cube on the
market while freestyling
so all these challenges
it&#39;s not funny all these challenges have
something in common at the beginning
they were a big deal but at the end
let&#39;s say just another day in the office
so the thing is though I never feel like
I have reached my limits so every time I
succeed on one of these challenges I&#39;m
ready for the next one and to freestyle
in English since you have noticed I&#39;m
not a native speaker is now the real
deal for me so here I am trying to do it
and it&#39;s game on I&#39;m thinking next time
maybe I&#39;ll hold Sofia&#39;s tarantula and
try to freestyle please don&#39;t kill me I
don&#39;t wanna die at least you can tell I
didn&#39;t try something like that oh I like
that one
so okay all this may make me wonder if
all this was making me smarter so I did
about a year ago an IQ test and scored
plus 13 compared to one I did like I
don&#39;t know five seven years ago so the
point is if I didn&#39;t push my limits I
would be 13 points less intelligent and
I don&#39;t think mathematics and logic are
intelligence in itself nevertheless is
an important part of it so that led me
to do some research and I found out
about the Flynn effect
it proves that last century our IQs were
racing by three to ten points per decade
and James Flynn gave a TED talk
explaining his research so check it is
very interesting so okay we know that we
can get smarter and we did get smarter
and one of the reasons for our IQ racing
was because of the war becoming more
complex rich or higher may did an
experiment where he made 50 students
play Tetris
nice day for them in the 80s it was not
as well-known as it is now so they
struggled completing lines but after 50
days plane Pet one of these brain
scanners that monitor our brain activity
demonstrated that with considerably less
effort than the first day they were
playing so much better same people same
game
another reason for our IQ racing was a
wider range of options for example in
Spain in 1960 if you wanted to buy a car
you could choose between three cars in
the market so if you had money you buy
the set 1500 if you want to buy the
second set 600 or its Big Brother 850
and now if we want to buy a car how many
options we have 50 60 70 more so in
order we have to consider many more
factors to acquire our best option
such combustive all power space extras
and so on so yeah so far so good we got
smarter whoa
but it&#39;s time to check what&#39;s going on
now today are we still getting smarter
in my opinion in my experience I have
noticed that people tend not to accept
challenges if there is a device that can
do that live for you
why should you learn we have apps for
almost everything they think for us they
decide for us they choose for us so if
we&#39;re not intellectually stimulated we
can fall into a routine where we do not
face new challenges anymore
and yeah we also tend to take
information for granted the web analytic
company turbot showed that most of
online article readers don&#39;t even read
more than half of it and 10% of them
just
read the headline and on Twitter for
instance I&#39;m sure many of you use
Twitter 14% of retweets get no clicks so
it&#39;s basically a lot of assimilation
without thinking our ability to focus
has decreased considerably Microsoft
found that since the year 2000 our
average attention span dropped from 12
seconds to 8 the massive amount of
information on social media provided the
internet provide forces us to multitask
so if we don&#39;t focus or we focus less we
do not improve in any area the way we
should so for instance I have some
friends that have told me we cannot play
guitar and I realized that they quit
after trying a few chords like I have to
practice some focus or better check my
facebook wall a cat video oh I go to
wassup yes I&#39;ll be there and own
Instagram notification oh I was talking
to my friend yeah I&#39;ll be there own a
cat feet pam overwhelming so yes it&#39;s
kind of tricky another curious fact that
I have notice is we tend to check our
cell phone and any time we have a moment
if I am with someone who goes to the
toilet first thing I do as soon as this
person leaves is I&#39;ll grab my phone and
then again cat video bla bla bla shibam
so we don&#39;t give our brain a break and
we don&#39;t realize how amazing Bordeaux
miss yes boredom is amazing you see this
guy&#39;s walking no boredom is amazing
because when you are bored you look
around you analyze you observe from your
own perspective so you create from you
and you are you
and something we don&#39;t do a lot lately
always busy always busy so I think I&#39;m
old because when I&#39;m 32 by the way but
when I observe the newer generations
when children and teenagers tend to
watch Songhai playing a video game on
YouTube instead of playing themselves
like in video games yeah they offer a
quite decent challenges some of them so
I really don&#39;t understand it and
actually the best selling toy in the 80s
was the Rubik&#39;s Cube and the
best-selling one now is the feature
spinner challenges now thank you so
after all this I thought I asked myself
are we becoming less intelligent
are we reversing the Flynn effect and
yeah beginning I was like no way that&#39;s
that&#39;s that&#39;s me maybe my crazy thought
but according to a survey by Hina
Wyndham and dab it Becca on Thomas our
coil
many experts on the Flynn effect believe
this is true and there is already
research that proves in certain first
world countries our average intelligence
is decreasing so yeah it makes sense and
it&#39;s already happening so now you may be
thinking this guy comes all the way from
Florida south of Madrid to tell you that
you will be stupid now
now I don&#39;t want any tomatoes coming
this way I&#39;m here just to remind you
that inside our head is a masterpiece
and it&#39;s up to us to use it to its full
capacity I don&#39;t mean you have to go
around solving square roots in your head
or learning Chinese in one month or
something like that if you want to be my
guest of course why not
but I mean observed your daily life next
time you go out to have dinner with
friends try to split the bill in your
head and if you&#39;re not able then use a
calculator or invite the mole but it&#39;s
more expensive it&#39;s up to you always try
to create your own opinion and don&#39;t
just swallow up information because the
world is like that lately and next time
you drive someplace you don&#39;t know try
to do it by using a map and if you get
lost then use a GPS and find an
intellectually demanding hobby play
chess play bass solve Sadako&#39;s the
rubik&#39;s cube complicated video games
whoever you enjoy because when you enjoy
it
you will become more intelligent by
having fun and at some point you will
look back and say wow I am doing this I
thought it was impossible so it&#39;s up to
us to be smarter to be the better
version of ourselves and live the world
to a brighter era muchas gracias
[Applause]
you
