hi so I&#39;m going to start my talk today
by telling all of you that my biggest
fear is that I will never be loved for
who I am in a romantic relationship
now some of you already going obviously
you are morbidly obese some of you can
see that I&#39;m not wearing makeup
some of you can see that I have a bit of
a strange sense of style anyone who
knows anything about African hair is
wondering why haven&#39;t you covered it up
with a weave or with braids or
straightened it with the same ingredient
that we use to unblock the shower drain
and I&#39;m here to tell you that this is
not a superficial problem so I went and
searched on Google and I found out that
when people look at me they expect me to
be good at relationships because I&#39;m a
woman even worse they think I&#39;m supposed
to be nurturing and have nesting
instincts right and I&#39;m here to tell you
I am terrible at relationships and
managing relationships I find
interacting with people in real life
inefficient and exhausting also I&#39;m also
totally under masticated it takes me a
month to do the same cause that other
people get done in a week and when I was
in medical school I learned that we each
only get one biological mother and when
she stops cooking cleaning doing your
laundry and nagging you to look after
yourself that&#39;s it it doesn&#39;t become my
job because I&#39;m a woman and anyway I
don&#39;t like doing that stuff for myself
so why should I do it for someone else
when I could be playing the late
just call of duty I&#39;m also I also find
the idea of living with someone a bit
ridiculous because I mean if Superman
had a fortress of solitude surely
everyone can understand that I need one
I have what used to be called Asperger&#39;s
syndrome which is just a
high-functioning form of autism and you
can read up some of the specifics after
this talk but I think the main point is
that I&#39;m great at learning information
that&#39;s presented in a logical way like
human physiology but I&#39;m terrible at
creating systems in the real world like
putting objects correctly into a
cupboard because there&#39;s no formula for
that and I need a formula all right
this for me is wouldn&#39;t be so bad but as
a woman with autism the problem that I
find with the rest of the world is when
people talk about people who are nerdy
intelligent socio qward socially
isolated and who are obsessed with
computer games but who can&#39;t look after
themselves they&#39;re always talking about
men so even if I&#39;m honest about it
people just don&#39;t get it so I thought
the best way to talk about being a woman
with autism is to talk about dating
right let&#39;s go back to how I started all
right let&#39;s go back to my biggest fear
and where it came from so I was about 12
when I started noticing that people form
these you know primitive sort of pea
bonds you know they would somehow do to
some magic series of events a boy and a
girl
would come into school and announce that
they were now boyfriend and girlfriend
they would you know exchange letters
they would be seen together between
classes and it seemed like a like a
great arrangement because when they were
in this you know relationship then they
were happy but
when they you know went through what was
called a breakup then they were sad and
even cruel to each other so I thought
yeah totally want some of this boyfriend
and girlfriend action so I sat down and
I cataloged all the boys in my class and
I looked for the ones who looked like
the lead singer of extreme they&#39;re the
band who sang more than words if anyone
knows him because this this seemed like
a good criteria at the time so I
selected a test subject who met the
eligibility criteria and then observed
them in formal and informal settings and
I would shut down my observations and
you know after a few weeks I&#39;d review
them write them up in a form of a report
and then deliver that to the test
subject with the obvious conclusion that
based on my excellent observations we
would make a great boyfriend and
girlfriend partnership and for the life
of me I could not understand why this
rational approach always failed
ok ok to be fair to be fair they were
other issues I was a black and native
english-speaking girl growing up in
South Africa in the mid to late 1990s so
the South African black people called me
horrible names like coconut which means
you&#39;re brown on the outside and white on
the inside or they said I was too
masculine or they said I was too
intelligent right but then on the other
hand you had white people who thought
that dating me was immoral or disgusting
or embarrassing right and then you had
all these people in between who were
like I just leave us out of it please we
don&#39;t want to be involved you know and
even after coming to Germany where I&#39;ve
had the benefit of meeting very educated
and very liberal people things have
gotten better but the autism related
difficulties are still there
so anyway for about 20 years I tried
many different things to try and achieve
this boyfriend and girlfriend status
right one of the most ambitious things I
did was learning how to code because I
really believed but the guy that I liked
was gonna walk into the computer labs
and he was gonna go you&#39;ve got going
[Applause]
[Laughter]
obviously he was gonna sweep me into his
arms and say I&#39;ve never met anyone like
you you know I would feel faint you know
the light would shine down from heaven
angels would start singing and of course
we would live happily ever after I did
get more practical as time went on one
thing another thing I did was to study
you know dating self-help books for like
four years because now dating was a
degree and I was trying to you know pass
the course and this this was actually
useful because I learned that as a woman
with autism eye contact is unbearable
for me but this eye contact thing is
where this whole boyfriend and
girlfriend thing starts in the first
place
unfortunately failing over and over
again was really difficult for me so in
the end I would end up going and and I
would and I would eat to relieve my
frustration I mean at one stage my
comfort food was an entire apple pie
with you know cream and now that I have
and now that I have tried to live with
the diagnosis openly I understand the
problem
if I want to develop emotional intimacy
with people and have them know me for
who I am I have to be honest
and this means saying things like
actually I don&#39;t
I find physical stimulation unpleasant
or say I can&#39;t go to a restaurant
because that the way cutlery goes makes
me feel like my eardrums are bleeding
and saying things like this to people
you know being honest about it makes
people think oh well I mean clearly you
you don&#39;t want a serious relationship
which is sad because as a woman with
autism instead of learning that dating
is fun exciting leads to long-term
partnership I learnt that dating leads
to rejection coercion arguments abuse
sadness and at the end of the day
everyone else made me feel like I was
unworthy of love just because I was too
different and on the other hand I
couldn&#39;t find a rational argument to
explain away this feeling of wanting to
connect intimately with people because I
mean wanting love is something that&#39;s
common to all of us whether you have
autism or not so I&#39;m really very glad
that I&#39;ve had this opportunity to say
this talk to all of you today because
it&#39;s been so therapeutic
I even even medical professionals and
psychologists will cut me off when I try
and talk about this stuff and say don&#39;t
worry don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll figure it out
right and I mean I&#39;m 35 now when exactly
you know so let&#39;s talk about some ways
that people can meet me in the middle
because I know that I am not the only
woman who struggles with this but the
problem is other women don&#39;t want to
talk about it because it&#39;s embarrassing
to suck so badly at something that
everybody else around you thinks is
completely natural you know
so one I mean the first thing I have to
say is if you want to date someone with
autism please go and read up about it
first it it saves so much hassle you&#39;ll
react with understanding and sympathy
instead of with rejection and ridicule
secondly I wish I could meet someone who
would have a no talking date with me so
that means we sit and communicate using
handheld devices but we&#39;re sitting right
next to each other so we still have the
real-life connection and if you&#39;re
wondering why if you&#39;re wondering why
this is because for someone with autism
dealing with conversation is one of the
most overwhelming things in the world
because when I&#39;m having a conversation
I&#39;m watching your body language which I
don&#39;t really understand anyway I mean
facial expressions all confusing right
I&#39;m trying to listen to what you&#39;re
saying but then I&#39;m also trying to block
out all the sounds and the noise and cut
what&#39;s going on I&#39;m trying to read your
lips because I&#39;m also trying to make
sure that I don&#39;t miss what yours if I
miss anything that I can&#39;t hear I&#39;ve got
to pick it up from your lips and then
I&#39;ve also got to worry about myself I
have to make sure that my own face isn&#39;t
the right configuration to say oh I&#39;m
having fun but I have to I have to have
to edit what I&#39;m saying so that I make
sure that I don&#39;t offend you some you
know accidentally I have to monitor my
own body language and and and deal with
my own discomfort because even things
even sensory stimulation like having
smart clothes on is unbearable for me
it&#39;s it&#39;s horrible so I would actually
truly be rather be in my room
you know barefoot in front of my
computer but I make the effort to go out
and interact with people in person so it
would be nice if people could meet me
halfway I think the next thing to say is
please verbalize right it&#39;s I know you
guys all understand what a what a wink
or a head tilt means but we may even
notice if we even understand what you&#39;re
doing right
ideally you should say things like I&#39;m
having a really good time with you and
I&#39;d like to put my arm around you now so
that we can logically process the
information and prepare for the
stimulation that&#39;s going to come instead
of going touching and I think the last
point for me is that you have to
remember that someone who&#39;s a woman with
autism has probably been traumatized by
the dating process for me I didn&#39;t even
know what being hit on was until I was
in my mid-twenties so if someone came up
to me in the supermarket or in you know
in a public place and wouldn&#39;t leave me
alone I would you know scream and get
upset because I thought they were trying
to kidnap me or something and on the
other hand now that I&#39;m older and I have
more experience
I&#39;m afraid whenever someone shows
interest in me because they expect me to
have a huge amount of dating experience
that I just don&#39;t have so a good example
was recently I was dating someone who
brought up the topic of moving in
together just a few weeks into dating
you know most other woman would be like
yes score you know and instead I was
like you know and this it&#39;s something
that you have to accept that these
relationship milestones are just going
to take longer and it&#39;s something that
everyone else has to deal with so after
telling you all of this stuff about
women with autism why would you want to
date them anyway we sound kind of
complicated and difficult right well one
good thing I can tell you is that I
definitely regard the people that I&#39;m in
love with with the sense of like
childlike admiration and wonder instead
of checking off you know points on a
list like is he gonna be a good
breadwinner yeah I I try and use my
abilities and my weirdness you know to
make life better for the other person
because I want to make
up for not being a typical girlfriend
I&#39;m loyal I&#39;m passionate and I&#39;m intense
I&#39;m a woman with autism and I reward
understanding direct communication and
tolerance with unconditional there&#39;s
thank you
[Applause]
