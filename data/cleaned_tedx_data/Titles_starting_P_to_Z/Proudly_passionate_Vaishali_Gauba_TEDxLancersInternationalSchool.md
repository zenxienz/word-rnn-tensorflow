so there is a thought hovering in all of
your minds right now when do we get to
leave the reason I say that is because
not too long ago I was in school myself
and I understand that if someone asked
us to come to school on a Saturday
it was pretty cringe-worthy so I
understand your pain of having to sit
here for a big chunk of your day
listening to a few people talk you&#39;re
probably wondering how could this ever
be important in your life just the way
you have wondered multiple times
how could calculus ever be important in
your life
well I cannot answer that for you
because I still wonder that myself to
this day but I can try answering your
question of why this speech today could
be worth your while so let me tell you a
story imagine this the year is 2010 the
country India a 16 year old boy has just
told his parents that he would like to
go to the u.s. to study engineering for
his bachelor&#39;s degree fortunately the
family is such that they can afford such
an education and the boy has the
credentials to get into a college like
that so what happens next
well everyone is pretty thrilled because
it&#39;s a pretty good news but a pretty
boring story now here is a plot twist
the year is 2010 the country India and a
16 year old girl has just told her
parents that she would like to go to the
u.s. to study journalism for her
bachelor&#39;s degree the earlier fortunes
that I mentioned in the original story
are
exactly the same alone to study
journalism who goes to the u.s. to study
journalism for a bachelor&#39;s degree and
that to a girl and that too alone so you
see the exact same story but I replaced
two words the word boy for girl and the
word engineering for journalism and this
story that I have so dramatically
presented to you is my story clearly I&#39;m
not a boy so my story is the girls
version and the shocking reactions that
I described to you did not come from my
parents to whom I had broken the news
but from members of the extended family
relatives family friends and people we
dub members of the society so let me
give you a little background about
myself I have never been one to give in
to pressure from the society but that
has not prevented that pressure from
coming at me you see I was a pretty good
student academically so people assumed I
would take up science in school I didn&#39;t
and then because I was bookish ly smart
people thought I must study a lot I
didn&#39;t in fact I was barely to be found
in the classroom I couldn&#39;t sit in one
place and absorb all the knowledge that
was being provided to me so I was mostly
outside engaging in extracurricular
activities
anyway so people&#39;s expectations
societies stereotypes have been off
little importance to me and my family
actually has played a very key role in
letting me be like that they have never
imposed anything on me they let me study
whatever wherever I wanted to because
you see
my father also wanted to do something
that was out of the stereotype he wanted
to be an electrical engineer now you are
probably wondering how is that out of
the stereotype after all we live in a
country obsessed with engineers doctors
and following the recent trends
unfortunately
that for anyone who doesn&#39;t know the
meaning it means a human god that people
put on a pedestal in India but in more
than one case these people have turned
out to be either crime lords or even
rapists anyway back to engineering
so if engineering were a religion in
India it would be the fifth most
populous religion in India and that is
behind religions that are actually
religions and not fields of study so my
father he wanted to be an electrical
engineer and that was not necessarily
debunking the stereotype the status quo
what was though he wanted to do it on
his own terms he wanted to be a
businessman in a family full of teachers
and people with secure jobs and mind you
this is a story of ancient times I&#39;m
sorry to make my father sitting here
feels so old but back in those times it
was a pretty big deal and a pretty risky
one to be a businessman the differing
factor in his story from mine is that he
never got any encouragement or support
from his family he did it anyway but I
think
taught him to not deny that kind of
encouragement to his children anyway
back to me so many young individuals
actually even in this day and age do not
have the kind of privilege that I got in
terms of the support from my parents in
fact the first people to often crush a
young person&#39;s dreams are often their
family members the second is the concept
of log Kaka hanging which translates to
what will people say so where does
passion play into all of this well I&#39;m
going to give you some sage Lee wisdom
it&#39;s going to sound very clich√©d but
it&#39;s true in life more people will try
to pull you down than people who will
try to show you up especially if your
ideas are against the wave of the
society so how do you prevent yourself
from getting weighed down by these
people and their expectations through
passion so passion in my words is
wanting something badly you don&#39;t have
to want it right now in fact there is no
good time to be passionate about
something but make sure that when you do
know what you really want you want it so
badly that nothing else matters and this
wanting can be of anything you can
really badly want to be an engineer
after all more than 1 million people in
India do and people will try to pull you
down by telling you you are not smart
enough you are
capable enough don&#39;t listen to them you
can really badly want to be a historian
and people will say is that even a
career how are you going to make money
don&#39;t listen to them I mean still pay
your bills but don&#39;t listen to them you
can really badly want to be a journalist
and people will tell you isn&#39;t that a
risky profession especially for a woman
is that even a respectable career I
didn&#39;t listen to them you see human
beings are very weird creatures we are
never satisfied
but if we keep suppressing our inner
voice our inner choice all we are doing
is pushing ourselves further away from
satisfaction by merely following a path
because others too are prodding down the
same path so it&#39;s passion everything can
you just really badly want something and
that&#39;s the answer to the most perplexing
riddle that we have been asking for ages
of course not there are other
ingredients in the recipe but nothing
that all you people here don&#39;t already
know be hard-working be focused and all
that jazz that you often hear at the
dinner table but there is something that
no one will tell you be stubborn now
parents and adults and teachers please
don&#39;t gasp I&#39;m not encouraging your
children and your students to be
stubborn to the extent where it&#39;s
burning holes in your pockets but what I
mean is we&#39;re often told then it&#39;s not a
good thing
to be stubborn we should be
accommodating we should be adjusting but
I would like to ask why why should I be
accommodating when it comes to my career
why should I adjust when it comes to my
personal growth if Barack Obama would
have been accommodating he may have
never been able to break the chain of
all white American presidents if Saina
Nehwal
would have been just a tad bit more
accommodating she may have never become
the highest-paid athlete outside the
realm of cricket in a country that
worships cricket but on the other hand
because we are made to adjust and
accommodate the men in the world still
make only $100 to have for every hundred
and forty dollars that a man makes none
of the big names that we know today are
big because those people adjusted and
accommodated those names are big because
those people didn&#39;t and they fought so
here&#39;s another story when I was at CBS
News which was up until two months ago
in New York I was at a very entry-level
position my job was to assist TV
producers with whatever they needed
whether it was research collecting
elements for their stories
going out on shoots anything of that
sort so when I felt that I had a swing
of my responsibilities I thought what if
I decide to do my own stories so I went
to someone who was in a more powerful
position than I was and I presented my
idea to them they said people in your
job profile don&#39;t really pitch stories
so why don&#39;t you stick to something that
is in your job profile and prove your
worth that way
I thought no and so I thought of an idea
I went to a producer and told them my
idea they said you could do it but it
might be a hassle to get a reporter and
then to get a camera crew
so I thought let&#39;s step into this hassle
after all were Indians were experts at
kicking off hassles on a daily basis
so I got the camera crew I got the
reporter we shot the story and I got all
my elements in place then came the final
leg of the process which was editing I
very excitedly went to an editor and I
said could you help me edit the story in
your free time no I went to another one
no I went to a producer and said is
there a day when my story could err no
the calendar is full of segments that we
need to air no no no no until I got one
yes and then one more until I had enough
yeses to finally have my story air just
days before my time at CBS News was up
some would call it persistence some
could call it men she&#39;s so annoying but
these are only ways to sugarcoat the
word stubborn and why take shame in
admitting that you are stubborn because
people will talk about you behind you
you know what they will anyway and once
you stop caring about what people have
to think or say that&#39;s when you will
achieve your best most badass moments in
life so my best moments in my career
came from being stubborn here on the
right is the story that I shot and was
finally able to get on air it also made
it to the website and then on the left I
also had the opportunity to read my own
story for air for a mock reel that I was
doing at CBS News all the result of not
accepting a bunch of nose so back to my
question of why the speech could even
remotely be important in your life
because when I was in school no one told
us that it was okay to want a different
path to walk that different path while
we read lions like robots from Robert
Frost&#39;s the road not taken no one said
it was actually okay to not take the
road that other people were taking and I
don&#39;t want that to be your roadblock so
I wanted to be the someone to tell you
that when it comes to your dreams be
stubborn be passionate be proudly
passionate thank you
[Applause]
