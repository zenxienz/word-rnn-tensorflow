when I was 15 years old my family took a
trip to Florida to visit friends because
of our friends generosity we were able
to stay in a beautiful home in Orlando
and visit all of the parks at
Disneyworld free of charge not only this
but I was able to bring my best friend
Scott along for the trip I was so
excited I couldn&#39;t think of anything
better now despite the fact that we
would be traveling to what is often
called the happiest place on earth I
decided that I needed more entertainment
and so I brought my Nintendo GameCube I
just bought a new game and I wanted to
play it with Scott Scott and I ended up
playing this game more than we did just
about anything else on this trip short
of sleeping and this was a problem not
because it kept us from enjoying other
elements of the trip but because I got
competitive something like that
I had always been competitive growing up
I played sports I love board games I
would even shout answers at the
television when jeopardy was on to try
to beat the contestants but something
about this game Soulcalibur to really
got me going and that was unfortunate
because by the second day of the trip
Scott was whooping me mercilessly
I just couldn&#39;t win and I couldn&#39;t stand
that I couldn&#39;t believe that he had come
with my family on my vacation
it was beating me at my video game I
deserved to win I had done so much for
him I couldn&#39;t think of a single reason
why I should be losing but I continued
to lose
by the end of the trip I&#39;d said some
things that I regretted I had thrown my
controller at least half a dozen times
across the room and I&#39;d almost punched
my best friend in the face this is one
of my most vivid memories in large part
because Scott remains my best friend to
this day but as I look back I realized
that my life has been filled with
experiences just like the one that I
described where I felt like I deserved
more lamented the fact that it wasn&#39;t
being given to me and got angry there&#39;s
a word to describe this type of behavior
entitled I&#39;ve wrestled with feelings of
entitlement for my entire life when
these feelings arise in the moment I
rarely recognize them for what they are
but after the fact I can see how they&#39;ve
poisoned my minds and potentially impact
relationships with the people that I
love with that said I&#39;m willing to bet
that I&#39;m not the only person in this
room who has experienced something like
this because if you have ever felt like
you deserve something more than somebody
else put somebody else down to further
yourself or done something selfish
without thinking about the consequences
it&#39;s because you felt entitled to that
and if you regretted anything that you
had said or done or thought then you
fought the same battle that I have
I decided to build an argument against
entitlement to try to change my
relationship with it so I could
understand it better I figured that if
I&#39;ve been able to rationalize my way
into these feelings for almost my entire
life surely I can rationalize my way out
of them along the way I&#39;ve realized that
the impacts of entitlement go far beyond
any individual who feels it as a
practice it&#39;s embedded in the fabric of
our society and that alone makes it
worth talking about I&#39;d like to share
the three points of my argument with you
today
number one our entitlement is part of a
larger game often a zero-sum game in
economics a zero-sum game is one where
the gains of the winners are
proportionate to the losses of the
losers a good example of this is poker
in poker there are a finite number of
chips and if you win a hand and you get
50 chips those 50 chips are being lost
by other people when we feel entitled in
order for our wish to come true some
thing or someone else is going to have
to cede resources and opportunity to us
and when we&#39;re talking about scarce
resources that are in such high demand
in our world like money and power and
Status it&#39;s inevitable that they&#39;re
going to be winners and losers why does
this matter
think back to the story I just told
about the time I spent in Florida with
Scott I wanted to beat him so badly at
that game I wanted to win every single
time and I did not care if he won once
but I never stopped to think about what
my overwhelming victory might mean for
him anger sadness disappointment
feelings of resentment towards the
situation or even towards me and I
wouldn&#39;t be able to fault him for any of
that because nobody likes to lose
especially not 100%
the time if this example strikes you as
insignificant in the broader scope of
our lives I assure you that it&#39;s
scalable let&#39;s say for example that you
are the secretary for Health and Human
Services
in the United States of America and
because of the work that you&#39;re doing
because of the respect that you&#39;ve
earned and the responsibilities that you
carry you feel entitled to privately
chartered flights whenever you travel
these flights cost money and you might
not stop to think about what your
expenditures mean for the availability
of resources now and in the future and
consequently you might not realize how
that impacts the ability for your
department to deliver on its promise of
public service what I&#39;m trying to say is
this when we feel we deserve something
more than somebody else or we have
something and we hold tightly to it and
not think of the consequences we need to
remember that there are other players in
the game which brings me to my second
point entitlement is an individual
feeling but it&#39;s become a societal issue
I&#39;ve realized that entitlement manifests
itself in two different ways as feeling
that we deserve something that we don&#39;t
have but also as holding tightly to
something that we already do I&#39;ve been
interested recently to see how the form
of these ideas has been cited as a
reason for concern for the future
because it&#39;s a hallmark of the
millennial generation but I&#39;m more
concerned about the latter of these two
ideas because that type of entitlement
is something that&#39;s been carried by our
country&#39;s most powerful social class
since the beginning and that class has
been unable to shake it I can say this
confidently because I was born into this
class I&#39;m white I&#39;m male and I&#39;ve been
afforded the opportunity to get an
education
I come from a small working-class family
and I understand what it means to
struggle in a small handful of ways but
I&#39;ve never been systematically put at
the losing end of somebody else&#39;s
entitlement game because of my race or
my gender or some other trait that I was
born into
you see when laws are passed in our
country to promote equality for minority
groups a barrier is lifted and the path
towards equality may seem more clear but
balance doesn&#39;t install itself it&#39;s a
responsibility of people who have
benefited from advantages in money in
status and power to cede some of what
they have and put it towards fighting
for equality it&#39;s our responsibility as
people to be conscious of this because
when we hold tightly to something that
we already have and we don&#39;t question
what that means for others we could very
well be causing damage to our society in
the long run in fact some damage has
already been done and I&#39;d like to share
two easy examples of this with you first
desegregation in America for schools was
mandated following the verdict of brown
versus the Board of Education over 60
years ago
yet there are school districts in
Alabama that are actively fighting to
lock black students out of their
programs groups of white people in
predominantly white areas feel entitled
to raising their children in an
environment that is exclusive and they
believe that to be to their benefit but
these people choose to ignore the impact
that this could have on those excluded
access to fewer resources overall a
weaker educational experience and it&#39;s
things like that that contribute to
stratification in our society another
example as recently as two
and sixteen women in America were making
eighty percent of what men earn for
doing the same work this comes 50 years
after the Fair Labor Standards Act was
passed in the United States to pave away
for equality between genders in the
workplace progress has been made but as
you can see the rate of progress has
actually slowed down over the past 15
years responsibility for this Falls to
business leaders who feel entitled to
run their businesses as they see fit
which might include actively or
passively supporting trends that pad
their bottom line or push some other
agenda but are clearly unfair to some of
their workers these circumstances
persist because when not violent or
loudly oppressive discrimination can be
difficult to spot let alone fight
against again when laws are passed in
this country it removes a barrier it
might clear a path but it doesn&#39;t
install balance automatically it&#39;s up to
people by their individual means to take
stock of what they have and to push for
equality before I get to my third point
I&#39;d like to ask everybody in the room to
think about someone that they feel
carries a sense of entitlement what is
it about this person that makes you view
them in this way I can&#39;t imagine that
you view this as an endearing quality
this is interesting to me because our
society wields the idea of entitlement
with a negative connotation and paints
it as an extreme which I think
inherently makes us less willing to see
it in ourselves I think it&#39;s important
that we normalize the idea of
entitlement because whether we recognize
it or not it&#39;s something that we all
feel every day
you may not be actively pining after
something that you feel you deserve
perhaps more so than somebody else but
you certainly feel entitled to your
sense of normal your daily routine
morning coffee vacations time spent with
family and friends these are all things
that you&#39;ve come to expect but what if
they were reduced or taken away from you
completely how would you feel it&#39;s easy
to forget when you benefit from
something or you have a privilege that
there are others in the world who don&#39;t
have that at all and some others who
have it to a lesser extent and could
still use the help
ultimately it&#39;s up to us to build a
culture of self-evaluation and
self-reflection so that we can do our
best to reconcile our expectations and
our wants with those of others with that
said I&#39;d like to leave you with one
final idea and that exactly is how we
can begin to manage our feelings of
entitlement to embrace it at first
understanding that it&#39;s a part of us but
ultimately channel it in a way that&#39;s
more effective because I don&#39;t expect
these feelings to ever disappear a few
years ago a professor and researcher
from the University of California named
Paul piff conducted a study on how to
reduce feelings of entitlement in
individuals for this he gathered
subjects and split them into two groups
all of the subjects were asked to
complete an evaluation that would allow
them to be graded on the psychological
entitlements scale or P es the p es
consists of nine statements that
respondents must express a degree of
agreement or greater disagreement with
the only difference between these two
groups was that before completing the
evaluation for the P es one group was
prompted to name three benefits of
treating others as
while the other was simply prompted to
his three activities that they complete
in the average day what the study found
is that the group that was prompted to
think about others was significantly
less entitled compared to the group that
was asked about themselves this is a
powerful idea simply by reminding
ourselves of the good that can come from
doing well by other people
we can distance ourselves from feelings
of entitlement from feeling like we
deserve more than somebody else and by
definition promote equality and feelings
of unity I feel that if we were able to
adopt this ingrain it in our everyday
lives as individuals and allow it to
scale up to a societal level we would be
able to potentially redefine how we view
concepts like fairness and equality and
necessity and what we deserve overall so
where do we start I think it begins with
ourselves we need to teach ourselves to
be humble to stop ourselves in the
moments where we feel like we&#39;re being
slighted we deserve something more than
somebody else and think of those others
next we need to engage other people on
this topic especially those who we feel
are likely to disagree progress will
never never come by reciting the same
idea in an echo chamber and although it
may be difficult to convince other
people that they should see things
differently if you share your story of
entitlement and your relationship with
it then perhaps you can convince them to
feel the same way and lastly but
certainly not the least of these points
we need to prepare to teach later
generations the ones that are coming
next
what it means to be humble and to
provide them the active support and the
structure needed for them to assimilate
the idea of humility into who they are
so that it becomes second nature this is
a tall order I know but I believe that
it can be done so long as we hold on to
one central idea we&#39;re all playing the
same game and we&#39;re playing it together
so the next time you feel entitled to
something you feel like you deserve
something more than somebody else think
about what that means for the others and
if you find it frustrating just don&#39;t
throw your controller thank you
