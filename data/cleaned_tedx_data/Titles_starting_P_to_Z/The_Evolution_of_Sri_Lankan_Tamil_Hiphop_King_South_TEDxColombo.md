hey good evening everybody how are you
doing all right
great so I am actually going to be
performing tonight at the same time I&#39;m
also going to be talking about the
evolution of double hip hop music
so for all you people who do not know me
I&#39;m crush on my sand also known as King
Saud and let me take you way back into
time right so where did it all start it
started in the mid 90s
where my brother gadget myosin and
myself two young passionate teenagers
who had a major liking towards rap music
right but we did not have much mediums
to consume rap music we only had FM
stations playing a little bit of rap
music and then we had access to record
bars that gave kick assets and CDs
remember the early 90s right so we we
used to buy these CDs listen to them and
then a local TV station starts promoting
MTV Jams for one now so we record these
programs on two VHS tapes keep watching
them over and over again getting
inspired by artists like Tupac Shakur
notorious b.i.g
Coolio gangster&#39;s paradise from the 90s
remember that so we used to practice
these songs and start writing our own
rap music so in 1997 my brother and I
started putting out music recording them
off tapes going into studios recording
our first single and in 1998 we get a
song played on FM radio stations so this
was quite an achievement when you&#39;re 15
years old you&#39;re still in school and
you&#39;ve got music playing on Royal on
radio so it was quite an achievement so
we were very very passionate they we&#39;d
form the band called urban sound started
doing a lot of local gigs and then we
met a producer young talented producer
kali raj right so we put out a lot of
singles in the early 2000s and then we
thought we need to create some sort of
an identity for ourselves how do we
stand out from the usual English rap
music so hip hop and rap is all about
storytelling keeping it relevant to your
culture so we thought we&#39;ll talk
things that are more relevant to us in
our own languages so in the 2000s the
war was on and we thought we will tell a
story about a young guy from the north
who faced the struggles and and tell his
story through a song called j-town story
so I wrote my first Tamil rap lyrics
saying the end involve a are determined
resolve our Deva mantra a tree in the
noodle a coal via right so would you
would you give them meaning to my life
and would you light up the lamp and shed
some light into my darkness right so I&#39;m
actually going to perform this song
taking you way back to 2004 and on stage
I&#39;m going to call up a very young
talented rapper RevZilla and Colleen due
on stage as well will be assisting me on
flutes and we will be performing j-town
story for you guys right if you know the
song we would like you to sing along
right

thank you whoa
so after Jayden story we had read a lot
of wide reception from all ethnicities
we should perform in different parts of
the island and people who did not did
not understand the language of Tamil
they used to rap these lyrics so he kind
of drove me to write more and more rap
music writing in double and in 2005 I
complete a 10-track album and I give it
to my label and I label CEO he calls me
up one day and says Kishan I have very
good news for you your album is going to
be distributed in India whoa ah sure
what do you mean who wants to distribute
it Universal Music India wants to put
your album out I was like wow I&#39;m 20s
I&#39;m in the early 20s I&#39;ve got an album
that&#39;s coming out of Universal Music
India and I was I was over the moon
right really and then I am from a
conventional middle-class Tamil family
my mom said no you&#39;ve got to go study
right so I had no choice I&#39;d to pack my
bags go complete my education come back
landed career in a corporate environment
balance my life with music and my my
career but at the same time what I
noticed is that we have such a large
tamil music industry or a movie industry
potential in Sri Lanka we have about 3.3
million peoples who speak Tamil but we
do not have an industry yet we&#39;re still
very dependent on South Indian
entertainment we have media stations we
have all of the for all of the print
electronic media promoting South Indian
content so we only have a handful of
Tamil original artists doing stuff so I
thought okay I should do something to
the next generation so I put out a post
on my social media account saying I&#39;m
looking for thermal rappers to feature
on a project so I&#39;ve got immense
response from different parts of the
island guys sending me demos selfie rap
videos etc so I picked them up I put
about nine of these rappers some from
Jeff
Safran Braddock hello Trinko culminate
hatton candy and then we put out the
first Sri Lankan Tamil rap cypher right
so I&#39;m actually gonna call these guys
only got four of them right I didn&#39;t
want to bring all 10 at them on stage we
look like a cricket team right so so I&#39;m
just gonna bring all four of them we
have young Krish
we have MC rah we have frame J and CV
laps they caught a bus from Trinko from
Betty from happen just to be here
tonight so let&#39;s guys let&#39;s give them
some support tonight right right so

elongate ambulance onstage and they&#39;re

thank you guys okay we gotta get up to
this guy&#39;s right all the way
representing double hip hop music whoa
right so moving on moving on so we&#39;re
we&#39;re actually in a generation that&#39;s
that&#39;s creating a lot of content right
the the music industry has changed we
had CD sales then we had mp3 sales and
now we have streaming music and it&#39;s
getting really hard for musicians to
sustain a live life a livelihood because
the commercialization angle of it is
still not very clear there&#39;s a lot of
gray area in terms of the music industry
right so the only way these artists or
these creators would would generate
revenue is through performances or
sponsorships or product placements etc
right so we are in a generation that&#39;s
creating a lot of content but we are
hoping that things would change so I&#39;m
gonna actually make and I actually show
you guys how easy it is to make
something out of your da W out of your
laptops out of your tablets make music
on the move and just publish it by the
click of a button right somebody&#39;s gonna
call RevZilla on stage one more time
right and we&#39;re just gonna make
something just here right here right now
okay
okay can we can we get some right I like
the sign of that okay so I&#39;m just going
to put a beat now together and then we
will start building it together right
[Music]
what&#39;s not looping that now right so
like I told you we like to bring in a
lot of our sounds and and this is like a
South Indian instrument that I like
trying out it&#39;s calling ode okay right
so it&#39;s got a great nice vibe to it okay
we&#39;re just gonna put that up on the weed
[Music]
right so have you been to tamil weddings
you guys meet at our weddings you would
have heard the towel right with the
Nadi&#39;s ruff
you read that right right so we just
gonna hand out on the track as well
right
it&#39;s got a nice bite to it so hip-hop
music won&#39;t be won&#39;t be possible without
a nice sample sound to it right okay so
we got that ready okay can I have
something we are going to talk about co2
you guys ready I&#39;m really hungry
