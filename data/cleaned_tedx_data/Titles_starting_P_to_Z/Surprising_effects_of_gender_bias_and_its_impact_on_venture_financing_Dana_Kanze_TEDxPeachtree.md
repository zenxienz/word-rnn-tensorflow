this is me at five years old
shortly before jumping into this
beautifully still pool of water I soon
find out the hard way that this pool is
completely empty
because the ice-cold water is near
freezing and literally takes my breath
away even though I already know how to
swim I can&#39;t get up to the water&#39;s
surface no matter how hard I try that&#39;s
the last thing I remember trying to do
before blacking out
turns out the lifeguard on duty had been
chatting with two girls when I jumped in
and I was soon underwater so he couldn&#39;t
actually see or hear me struggle I was
eventually saved by a girl walking near
the pool who happened to look down and
see me the next thing I know I&#39;m getting
mouth-to-mouth and being rushed to the
hospital to determine the extent of my
brain loss if I had been flailing at the
water&#39;s surface
the lifeguard would have noticed and
come to save me I share this near-death
experience because it illustrates how
dangerous things are when they&#39;re just
beneath the surface today I study
implicit gender bias and startups which
I consider to be far more insidious than
mere overt bias for this very same
reason when we see or hear an investor
behaving inappropriately towards an
entrepreneur we&#39;re aware of the problem
and at least have a chance to do
something about it but what if there are
subtle differences in the interactions
between investors and entrepreneurs that
can affect their outcomes differences
that we&#39;re not conscious of that we
can&#39;t directly see or hear before
studying startups at Columbia Business
School I spent five years running and
raising money for my own startup I
remember constantly racing around to
meet with prospective investors while
trying to manage my actual business at
one point I joked that I had reluctantly
pitched each and every family member
friends colleague angel
Buster and vici this side of the
Mississippi well in the process of
speaking to all these investors I
noticed something interesting was
happening I was getting asked a very
different set of questions than my male
co-founder I got asked just about
everything that could go wrong with the
venture to induce investor losses while
my male co-founder was asked about our
ventures homerun potential to maximize
investor gains essentially everything
that could go right with a venture he
that asked how many new customers we
were gonna bring on well I got asked how
we were gonna hang on to the ones we
already had well as the CEO of the
company I found this to be rather odd in
fact I felt like I was taking crazy
pills but I eventually rationalized it
by thinking maybe this has to do with
how I&#39;m presenting myself or it&#39;s
something simply unique to my startup
well years later I made the difficult
decision to leave my startup so I could
pursue a lifelong dream of getting my
PhD it was at Columbia that I learned
about a social psychological theory
originated by Professor Tori Higgins
called regulatory focus which
differentiates between two distinct
motivational orientations of promotion
and prevention a promotion focus is
concerned with gains and emphasizes
hopes accomplishments and advancement
needs while a prevention focus is
concerned with losses and emphasizes
safety responsibility and security needs
since the best case scenario for
prevention focus is to simply maintain
the status quo this has us treading
water just to stay afloat while
promotion folks focus instead has a
swimming in the right direction it&#39;s
just a matter of how far we can advance
well I had my very own Eureka moment
when it dawned on me that this concept
of promotion sounded a lot like the
questions posed to my male co-founder
while prevention resembled those
questions asked of me as an
entrepreneurship scholar I started
digging into the research on startup
financing and discovered there&#39;s an
enormous gap between the amount of funds
that male and female founders raised
although women
found 38% of US companies they only get
2% of the venture funding I got to
thinking what if this funding gap is not
due to any fundamental difference in the
businesses started by men and women what
if women get less funding than men due
to a simple difference in the questions
that they get asked after all when it
comes to venture funding entrepreneurs
need to convince investors of their
startups homerun potential it&#39;s not
enough to merely demonstrate you&#39;re not
going to lose your investors money so it
makes sense that women would be getting
less funding than men if they&#39;re
engaging in prevention as opposed to
promotion oriented dialogues why got the
chance to test this hypothesis on
companies with similar quality and
funding needs across all years that the
funding competition known as TechCrunch
Disrupt startup battlefields has run in
New York City since its inception in
2010 TechCrunch is widely regarded as
the ideal place for startups o launch
with participants including startups
that have since become household names
like Dropbox Fitbit and mint presenting
to some of the world&#39;s most prominent
VCS will despite the comparability of
companies in my sample mail that
startups went on to raise five times as
much funding as a female at once this
made me especially curious to see what&#39;s
driving this gender disparity well took
a while but I got my hands on all the
videos of both the pitches and the Q&amp;A
sessions from TechCrunch and I had them
transcribed I first analyzed the
transcripts by loading a dictionary of
regulatory focused terms into the
linguistic inquiry and word count
software called Luke this Luke software
generated the frequencies of promotion
and Prevention words in the transcribed
text as a second method I had each of
the questions and answers manually coded
by the Tori Higgins research lab at
Columbia regardless of the topic at hand
an intention can be framed in promotion
or prevention let&#39;s take that
pick of customers I mentioned briefly
earlier a promotion coded question
sounds like how many new customers do
you plan to acquire this year well a
prevention coded one sounds like how do
you plan to retain your existing
customers during the same time I also
gathered background information on the
startups and entrepreneurs that can
affect their funding outcomes like the
startups age quality and funding needs
and the entrepreneurs past experience so
I could use these data points as
controls in my analysis well the very
first thing that I found is that there&#39;s
no difference in the way entrepreneurs
present their companies in other words
both male and female entrepreneurs use
similar degrees of promotion and
prevention language in their actual
pitches so having ruled out this
difference on the entrepreneur side I
then moved on to the investor side
analyzing this six minutes of Q&amp;A
sessions that entrepreneurs engaged in
with the VCS after pitching when
examining the nearly 2000 questions and
corresponding answers in these exchanges
both of my methods showed significant
support for the fact that male
entrepreneurs get asked promotion
questions and female entrepreneurs get
asked prevention questions in fact a
whopping 67% of the questions posed to
male entrepreneurs for promotion focused
while 66% of those posed to female
entrepreneurs were prevention focused
what&#39;s especially interesting is that I
expected female VCS
to behave similarly to male VC&#39;s given
its prevalence in the popular media and
the venture funding literature I
expected the birds with other theory of
homophily to hold here
meaning that male VCS would favor male
entrepreneurs with promotion questions
and female VCS would do the same for
female entrepreneurs but instead all
VC&#39;s displayed the same implicit gender
bias manifested in the regulatory focus
of the questions they posed to male
versus female candidates so female these
these asked male entrepreneurs promotion
questions and then turned around and
asked female entrepreneurs prevention
questions just like the male VC&#39;s did so
given the facts that both male and
female VCS are displaying this implicit
gender bias what effect if any does this
have on startup funding outcomes my
research shows it has a significant
effect the regulatory focus of investor
questions not only predicted how well
the startups would perform at the
TechCrunch Disrupt competitions but also
how much funding the startups went on to
raise in the open market those startups
who are asked for dominantly promotion
questions went on to raise seven times
as much funding as those asked for
venturing questions but I didn&#39;t stop
there I then moved on to analyze
entrepreneurs responses to those
questions and I found that entrepreneurs
are apt to respond in kind to the
questions they get meaning a promotion
question B gets a promotion response and
a prevention question B gets a
prevention response now this might make
intuitive sense to all of us here but it
has some unfortunate consequences in
this context of venture funding so what
ends up happening is that a male
entrepreneur gets asked a promotion
question granting him the luxury to
reinforce his association with the
favorable domain of gains by responding
in kind while a female entrepreneur gets
asked to prevention question and
inadvertently aggravates her association
with the unfavorable domain of losses by
doing so these responses then trigger
venture capitalists subsequent bias
questions and the questions and answers
collectively fuel a cycle of bias that
merely perpetuates the gender disparity
pretty depressing stuff right well
fortunately there&#39;s a silver lining to
my findings those plucky entrepreneurs
who managed to switch focus by
responding to prevention questions with
promotion answers went on to raise 14
times more funding than those who
responded to prevention questions with
prevention answers
so what this means is that if you&#39;re
asked a question about defending your
startup&#39;s market share you&#39;d be better
served to frame your response around the
size and growth potential of the overall
pie as opposed to how you merely plan to
protect your sliver of that pie so if I
could ask this question
I would say we&#39;re playing in such a
large and fast-growing market that&#39;s
bound to attract new entrance we plan to
take increasing share in this market by
leveraging our startups unique assets
I&#39;ve just subtly redirected this
dialogue into the favorable domain of
gains now these results are quite
compelling among startups that launched
at TechCrunch but field data can merely
tell us that there&#39;s a correlational
relationship between regulatory focus
and funding so I sought to see whether
this difference in regulatory focus can
actually cause funding outcomes by
running a controlled experiment on both
angel investors and ordinary people
simulating the TechCrunch Disrupt
environment
I had participants listen to four
six-minute audio files of ten
question-and-answer exchanges that were
manipulated for promotion and prevention
language and then ask them to allocate a
sum of funding to each venture as they
saw fit well my experimental results
reinforced my findings from the field
those scenarios where entrepreneurs were
asked promotion questions received twice
the funding allocations of those were
entrepreneurs were asked prevention
questions what&#39;s especially promising is
the fact that those scenarios where
entrepreneurs switched as opposed to
match focus when they received
prevention questions received
significantly more funding from both
sets of participants so to my female
entrepreneurs out there here are a
couple simple things you could do the
first is to recognize the question
you&#39;re being asked are you getting a
prevention question if this is the case
answer the question at hand by all means
but merely frame your response in
promotion and efforts of garner higher
amounts of funding for your startups the
unfortunate reality though
is that both men and women evaluating
startups display the same implicit
gender bias in their questioning
inadvertently favoring male
entrepreneurs over female ones so do my
investors out there I would offer that
you have an opportunity here to approach
Q&amp;A sessions more even-handedly not just
so that you could do the right thing but
so that you can improve the quality of
your decision-making by flashing the
same light on every startups potential
for gains and losses you enable all
deserving startups to shine and you
maximize returns in the process today I
get to be that girl walking by the pool
sounding the alarm that something is
going on beneath the surface together we
have the power to break this cycle of
implicit gender bias and startup funding
let&#39;s give the most promising startups
regardless of whether they&#39;re led by men
or women a fighting chance to grow and
thrive thank you
