imagine imagine you&#39;re holding a
mousetrap in your hands it&#39;s small but
it bites now ask yourself would you put
your finger in there probably not well
today I would like to share with you the
surprising benefit of trying something
new and because today is all about
daring reality
I didn&#39;t just bring an imaginary Mouse
crap
I brought an animal trap now to give you
an idea how powerful this trap is I will
sacrifice this pen watch as you can see
it snaps a pen in half like a freshly
baked pretzel now bear with me as I
reset the jaws of death area now if I
were to put my hand in there that would
definitely qualify as trying something
new right
well he&#39;s and gentlemen for your
entertainment pleasure
yeah better not obviously
you can&#39;t put your hand in an animal
trap we all know that but I promise you
by the end of my talk today I will
convince you all that you can but first
I have an assignment for you
I want you all to think of something
you&#39;ve always wanted to do but never
have because you believe you can&#39;t now
after my talk you&#39;re all going to
receive a card and I&#39;d like you to write
it down there put it in your wallet and
keep it there until you&#39;ve done it but
for now all I want you to do is think of
something you&#39;ve always wanted to do
take a moment
all right I hope you&#39;ve got something
we&#39;ll get back to that in a little bit
now what&#39;s the scariest question you can
ask any long-term traveller why do you
do it let me try to explain I come from
a family of four my father my mother my
brother and me I&#39;m the youngest now my
father and my brother have both had
their own businesses for many years but
I don&#39;t I&#39;ve always been known as the
scatterbrain of the family the one that
doesn&#39;t finish anything here&#39;s me not
finishing my sandcastle
growing up I quit all sorts of things
but when I turned 23 I had found the one
thing I wanted to do I wanted to become
a Marine and so I joined the Dutch
Marine Corps but after about six months
it turned out it was way too tough I
couldn&#39;t do it and so you guessed it I
quit
again proving to my father proving to
everyone that I can&#39;t finish anything
and for a long time this was really
nagging at me I didn&#39;t know how to deal
with it so about two years later I had
the perfect plan
I would reinvent myself as an adventurer
and that was perfect because now I could
prove to my father that I could stick
with something I could prove to myself
that I could endure a hardship but best
of all I would be doing something
different every single day satisfying my
scatterbrain so that&#39;s why I started
traveling but even though I started out
for these somewhat dysfunctional reasons
over time by trying all these new things
I discovered a surprising benefit now to
explain what that benefit is we all have
to travel to the G Colton mountains of
British Columbia Canada a few years ago
I was working as a whorl in his guide in
these mountains
and working with these horses taught me
about the concept of limiting beliefs at
the end of an eight-hour ride we would
round up the horses leave them into the
meadows and there we would stake them
overnight we would use a wooden stake
about the size of a baseball bat we
would hammer it into the ground put a
rope around the stake and around the leg
of the horse that way the horse had a
circle of grass that it could eat
overnight but what I never understood
why are these incredibly powerful
animals let themselves be imprisoned by
a stick didn&#39;t make any sense to me well
it turns out the way they train these
animals is when they&#39;re still young they
tied them to the exact same stake and
for hours these horses tried to break
free but they can&#39;t and eventually they
get so exhausted they don&#39;t even try
anymore they just stand there and as
they grow up and become these incredibly
powerful horses you know what they do
they still just stand there ironically
you and I we do the exact same thing
when you&#39;re younger we have experiences
we can&#39;t do something we&#39;re told we
can&#39;t do something or we simply fail and
as we grow up we don&#39;t even try anymore
and often like the horses the only thing
holding us back is in our minds and that
is a limiting belief now the question is
how do you change a limiting belief how
do you change something that you believe
is reality well you do it by trying
something new when I started traveling I
didn&#39;t see myself as the kind of person
that could do all these adventures I
still saw myself as a quitter
what has I rolled from one adventure to
the next they started getting bigger and
bigger and at some point I&#39;m not exactly
sure when it was I realized I no longer
see myself as a quitter
I see myself as the kind of person that
can actually go out and do these things
why well I had all these new experiences
backing up that belief and at this point
I finally felt ready to take on even a
bigger challenge I wanted to paddle the
entire Mississippi River in a kayak so I
sent my dad an email telling him about
this grand adventure I wanted to do and
he replied by sending me a list of
newspaper articles of people that nearly
drowned on the river not very helpful
but I decided to do it anyway and to my
surprise my father ended up joining me
for the first few days now it&#39;s
incredibly hard to describe what a long
journey like this is like so here&#39;s a
video to give you guys an idea
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
their face very different challenges the
Regina box pretty cool well that coming
through beat some order in the works
which fortunately carry my gear across
long stretches of land
I love quickly not the sweep on
riverbanks those ships
[Music]
[Music]
yes that&#39;s probably why
[Music]
the goal was always present kindness
from strangers people baby food water
showers
[Music]
laughter I finally reach the Gulf of
Mexico a fishery went out of his way to
bring back a civilization during these
hundred ten days I discovered that the
most important part of any adventure is
that people
when you try something new you are never
alone as you could see during my
Mississippi adventure I was surrounded
by the kindness of strangers and I&#39;ve
seen that same kindness throughout all
my travels and I think that&#39;s because
when you try something new when you
decide to go out of your comfort zone
when you decide to change something
about yourself you inspire people and
they want to be a part of your journey
all you have to do is share what you&#39;re
doing and not be afraid to reach out now
there&#39;s one thing I haven&#39;t talked about
yet and that&#39;s fear when you try
something new it can be incredibly scary
as I&#39;m sure you all know I still feel
that same fear every time I go on one of
these adventures and that&#39;s never gonna
go away but here&#39;s a little trick you
can use to deal with that fear next time
you try something new
burn your ships what do I mean by that
the Spanish explorer had a Nam Cortez in
1519 wanted to conquer the Aztec empire
but he was completely outnumbered and
his men believed it was impossible for
them to succeed so he did something
radical he ordered his men to burn all
the ships and by doing so he took away
their option of retreat he took away
their way out
now they had only two options either die
or succeed and so they managed to
conquer the Aztec empire so next time
you try something new
consider burning your ships as well tell
someone you really respect about your
plans or share your goals publicly on
social media or if you really want to
burn your ships give a friend two
hundred and fifty euros and every time
you make a little bit of progress
towards your goal you get back a little
bit of money but if you don&#39;t make
progress or if you abandon your goals
you lose your money now if you want I
can be that friend for you
in my next adventure I also want to burn
my ships
I want to conquer a fear that I a nearly
every other long-term traveler has and
that&#39;s running out of money in 2018 I&#39;m
going to walk from Holland to Jerusalem
but here&#39;s the catch
I&#39;m gonna do it without money so I send
my dad another email telling him about
this new adventure at this time he
didn&#39;t send me a list of all the ways I
could possibly die instead he said two
things first of all something I will
never forget he said knowing you you&#39;ll
be able to do it and this was very
important for me to hear because it
means he no longer sees me as a quitter
he also said take a credit card just in
case you fail but I said no I can&#39;t take
a credit card because if things do get
tough I will use it but if I don&#39;t if I
burn my ships and things get really
tough
I have only one option coming up with a
solution so that&#39;s happening next year
it&#39;s been almost six years now that I
started traveling and a lot of my
beliefs about what I can do have changed
so do I still have limiting beliefs yes
more than I can count
but the point is I now know how I can
change them by trying new things just a
few weeks ago I was in Ireland at a show
that explores limits of pain and at the
end of a show the performer would take
his hand and put it in an animal trap in
fact this is the exact same trap that
used UC acid show I was talking to him
and at some point you got a smirk on his
face and he said do you want to try it I
said no I I can&#39;t do that but as soon as
the words left my mouth I knew that is a
limiting belief and it reminded me of
what my travels have taught me even
though I might not be able to do
something today
I can become the person that can and the
same goes for you all even though you
might not be able to do something today
you can become the person that can at
the beginning I asked you all to think
of something you&#39;ve always wanted to do
maybe it&#39;s writing your own book
starting your own business or perhaps
it&#39;s simply eating more healthy or
exercising more regularly whatever it
might be I want to challenge you all to
start daring your reality to start
trying new things because the benefit of
trying new things is that you can change
your beliefs it&#39;s gonna be scary you&#39;ll
want to run back to your comfort zone so
burn your ships and last but not least
when you try something new when you
decide to change something about
yourself people want to help you
and you are never alone and now it&#39;s
time for me to try something new but I&#39;m
gonna need your help
ten nine eight whoa let&#39;s write it one
more time but with a bit more enthusiasm
ten nine eight seven
thank you
[Applause]
