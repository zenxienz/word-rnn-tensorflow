namaste good evening how are you all
okay now I have been told that I have to
speak here for a couple of minutes and I
like it to be two-way okay I&#39;m gonna
speak about something we all have and we
don&#39;t talk about it and it is high time
that we speak about it if I had to walk
to you and ask you this one question if
you&#39;re not with your friends can you
identify and name the person who is
sitting besides you there are very high
chances you have no idea Amerigo girl I
I have come to the talk there are three
kinds of scared people inside this room
I like to show you the first kind
superior the second category even more
scared start kur let me see what you do
and the third one hello my name is
petitioner I&#39;m very very scared today
can you stick besides me we all are
scared and we are not talking about it
my dear friends fear was given to you
humankind so that we can be careful not
to paralyze ourselves we are paralyzed
hats off the two ladies who came before
me hats off to you fantastic you stood
here in spoke I&#39;m so proud of you
now you know one thing I&#39;m gonna do
something here and let me see this this
is Ruby for the very first time TEDx is
doing something like this okay
I&#39;m gonna play some kind of music here
some genre of music and I would like
people to come here one at a time and
dance till the time the music is on how
many people would like to do it and what
is happening right now the very moment
few people came to know that they have
bought a stahma now you will give me a
million maybe a billion reason not to
come here you might say usually I don&#39;t
dance on Saturdays or you might go ahead
and tell me are you giving money or you
might go ahead and see but you would
never do it by yourself it&#39;s very easy
to go ahead and tell other people to do
it and not do yourself because somewhere
we are scared and I would like to blame
someone from the beginning of your life
someone very close to you your parents
your parents scared you because they
wanted to control you they&#39;re gonna kill
me after this talk I know okay they want
you to control you when you&#39;re a kid you
are a very highly creative person
Humongousaur maybe never ending amount
of energy you have so you don&#39;t want to
do two things in your life and you&#39;re a
child never sleep never eat okay so your
mother tells better please eat eat no no
and you keep on doing that and finally
say been asleep no and what does she
tell you sleep baba Yaga Baba is kind of
a demon I don&#39;t know and children are so
creative they think and they come out
with some this beautiful picture that
this person has to be really dangerous
and I can guarantee you in this room
there are seventy percent of people who
even today when they are alone in a
single room in a hotel room or in their
room they never sleep without their
light switched off
because they&#39;re scared because Buddha
Baba can come from anywhere him that&#39;s
one mother told us why I&#39;m a I&#39;m a
behavioral coach I&#39;ve been doing it for
quite a lot of years I train people on
leadership team building decision-making
negotiation and I make good money and
and and there was a moment when I was
sitting with my seven-year-old kid and I
was we were having a discussion and I
always find young kids very intelligent
and we were talking about fear and she
told me something very very beautiful
she told me that dad you&#39;re not teaching
anyone leadership she understands
leadership okay
she understand the one who is the boss
is a leader okay she understand
decision-making I telling her no that&#39;s
decision-making so she said dad I think
so you&#39;re not training people on
leadership team building decision-making
negotiation skills I&#39;m doing something
else and she left it made me think and
this is what I thought yes I&#39;m
addressing something else I&#39;m addressing
fear of people I&#39;m addressing a person
who cannot lead to lead I&#39;m addressing a
person who cannot negotiate negotiate I
am addressing a person or training a
person who cannot make a decision make a
decision I&#39;m making a person who cannot
speak before people speak before people
I am taking them out of their comfort
zone that&#39;s what I am doing and that is
why I&#39;m here my dear friends you have to
know a little bit my story I don&#39;t have
a inspirational great story my story is
very much like your story at the age of
six
someone put a hand inside my bed sheet
and touched me inappropriately well I
never said it to anyone because I was
scared
and again like I told you as statistics
of 70 percent just three minutes before
let me tell it right now 90 percent of
the girls in our country and 99 percent
of the boys in our country have been
touched in appropriately and they never
said a word to you because you were told
to be quite and you were
scared it&#39;s high time we talk but don&#39;t
get into sad zone nothing happened to me
I&#39;m chilled out I was very very very
scared after that I couldn&#39;t face people
if someone came to my home I used to go
below the bed and never get out of the
time they&#39;re gone
and finally when I was in my fifth grade
my mother did something beautiful to me
she told me tomorrow there is a fancy
dress competition and you&#39;re going to
participate in it and me being myself I
was like mama what Pease I said so many
things to her so that I should not go to
school she was smarter than me she sent
me I come to the school and I stand
there and I perform for the very first
time in my life and we had more than
thousand students in our school and I
stood there when I watched that I was a
performer and people clapped for me for
a very very long time and that is the
moment I realized that this is what I
was to do in my entire life but thanks
to my mom because she took me out of my
comfort zone I was less scared I grew up
a little bit more and I&#39;m no more afraid
of things I speak my mind but there is a
problem in a country when you speak your
mind you&#39;re an arrogant person because
assertiveness in our country is
understood as aggressiveness my dear
friends it is time to go ahead and speak
your mind anything that you feel like
you can express this life is to enjoy
people feel scared to even enjoy I know
of a lot many people like your I have
enjoyed for last weekend to mature now
two years I cannot enjoy or when Mama
data tells you or sends you a party on
Friday night two hours enjoy and then
come back okay I never understood this
quantification of enjoyment like two
words and then come back yeah I&#39;ve
enjoyed enough
so it doesn&#39;t happen that way so today I
run a college with India&#39;s finest at
FileMaker a college called as the pellet
cooker school of branding and
entrepreneurship and we train people on
making ad films and becoming
entrepreneurs and because of this one
man who came here before me dr. velu
money we are able to do that thank you
sir
and we thought how could we be a
different kind of an entrepreneurship
College
what could we teach them differently it
was very clear we wanted to create
fearless entrepreneurs a person who can
make decisions take decisions and stay
with it so today what we do with these
students I will tell you the very first
day you walk inside our College we don&#39;t
come to our College you go to Napa
Valley&#39;s house and spend an entire days
with standing hard work the next day you
come you spend the next six days with
the India&#39;s most loved raghu Raja from
Rudi&#39;s Fame who does a boot camp with
you so he pretty much breaks you
mentally or physically by that time half
of the students are like I don&#39;t want to
do this course what blue shirts goes is
let me go back so we are clear there
what we are doing we take you to
Himalayas doing trekking with gambling
Tenzing Norgay son of Tenzing Norgay
we take you to South Africa with Gary
Kirsten and push you out of plane the
flying one so many a times people have
asset why do you some do something like
that because my dear friend if you are a
person out of fear you are more you are
vey more you understand your true
potential which we today are not
understanding because everyone wants to
control you all the ladies here all the
girls here understand this one thing you
are way more powerful than any men on
this planet and the problem is and the
problem is the menu this men knows about
it so they will control you don&#39;t do
this don&#39;t do that
we control you you know you
are the only being on this planet who
goes around transformational changes
every 10 to 15 years you never live in
the house that you were born your body
goes through so many changes you have
got so many more roles to do and you
don&#39;t complain and man has to do nothing
just tell you behave yourself so what I
would like to say here or my point of
coming here and telling you this is my
dear friends there are three things that
you should do in your life these are not
a B or C grade this is e your human kind
you have limitless possibility so the
very first e explore explore the world
don&#39;t be born in one place and die five
kilometers away explore the world second
express yourself let no one tell you
that you can&#39;t say something why can&#39;t
you say anything you can express and
that starts with parents let your kids
express you&#39;ll have more confident kids
amongst you you don&#39;t need any MBA to do
that like sir always says if your family
tells you but I express whatever you
like be who you are a kid will never
ever lie to you a kid lies to you only
because yeah and third most important
thing never ever be shy to enjoy this
there is only one life here enjoy
yourself this is the only life you have
meet the maximum number of people enjoy
yourself find your true passion and you
live this life happily and make a
difference thank you so very much this
is petition
