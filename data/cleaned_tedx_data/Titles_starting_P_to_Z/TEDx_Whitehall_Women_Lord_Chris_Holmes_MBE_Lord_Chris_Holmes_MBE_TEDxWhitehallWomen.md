hi I&#39;m Chris
this is Lottie I thought everybody was
bringing their dog great to be here we
live in incredibly disruptive times hung
parliament terrorism Trump Raqqa Russia
brexit all of that is disruptive is
disturbing but what our for you today is
in spite of all of that what the fourth
Industrial Revolution promised us us is
far far more disruptive than all of
those disturbing disruptive factors put
together and the narrative goes
something like this the bots are coming
our jobs are going and we&#39;re all off to
hell and nobody even knows if we have a
handcart
I hear that narrative I don&#39;t believe in
that narrative one-ounce I&#39;m lucky
enough in Parliament to be on select
committees on artificial intelligence
the fourth Industrial Revolution data
analytics FinTech everything I hear
everything I learn everything I read
from those groups convinces me that why
shouldn&#39;t we be positive and believe
that if we&#39;re positive and we
collaborate that we can plan for a
future where everybody&#39;s included and a
future which is better tomorrow than it
is today and that future will be built
on technology and us humanity and the
technology bridging together to that
brighter future but we have to get a few
things straight we have to get the
everythingness of what&#39;s coming down the
track
Internet of Things Big Data machine
learning AI robotics 3d printing each
and every one of them with the power to
make a massive transformation when you
put all of the
together what an extraordinary force
already underway at incredible pace it&#39;s
no good people thinking my area&#39;s
Defense Home Affairs education health
this digital stuff is all over there for
somebody else
the everythingness of the fourth
Industrial Revolution with the power to
transform every single thing we do
professionally personally right across
our working and private lives everything
everything potentially up for change but
alongside that the fundamental truth
that everything are nothing changes
everything and nothing changes
we&#39;ve never been more connected across
the globe and yet how many whirring
examples of nationalism right around the
world we&#39;ve never taken more photographs
and yet
where&#39;s Kodak and crucially everything
and nothing changes the human heart
remains the same what we want how we
live how we work how we love how we die
remains the same what we want what we
want out of our work what companies do
we want to work with what communities do
we want to live in what cities what
countries
what world all within our grip humanity
and technology bridging together but how
do we go about that because
understandably with this amount of
disruption massive anxiety we see
surveys 35% of jobs are going to be
wiped out by automation by the same
token two million more jobs needed in
the digital space jobs coming on stream
we don&#39;t even know the job title of at
this stage no wonder we feel anxious so
without having or even desiring all the
certainties
we need to grip some solid stuff so what
do we need to do to bridge together
towards that future firstly education at
the heart of everything we need
digital literacy to be seen as
significant as numeracy and literacy
right through preschool to the moment we
take our last breath we need to have
inclusion as the golden thread running
through all of this inclusion the mother
and father of innovation and I&#39;ll tell
you a stat to prove this in 2014 in the
UK just over four thousand young people
took a level Computer Studies just over
four thousand fewer than a hundred were
female yes we have to think about
inclusion we have to think about
infrastructure if we&#39;re going to have
enabled empowered people to operate a
flourish in this fourth Industrial
Revolution you&#39;ve got to have the
infrastructure as faster broadband fiber
satellite all of that because the
barriers to entry are being wiped away
you can run a global business from your
bedroom but you can&#39;t do that if you
can&#39;t get online rural not spots not
spots in the heart of London all of this
has to be addressed massive issues for
private public policymakers across the
piece crucially it&#39;s about talent you
may remember the Google billboards in
Silicon Valley huge billboards saying we
are hiring PhDs not specific just PhDs
because we want to get the brain power
into our organization talent and yet by
the same token everything in nothing
changes we currently have a government
determined to keep international
students in the net migration figures
how can we attract the brightest and the
best to come and work in Britain in the
fourth Industrial Revolution if the
message going out there is we want your
trade we don&#39;t want your children
it&#39;s about leadership everything and
nothing changes leadership at every
level of an organization everybody
playing their part everybody having a
voice and everybody&#39;s voice absolutely
needing to be heard having to be heard
in that mix and it can&#39;t be about
marginal games some big bets have to be
laid down let&#39;s consider that in white
or what are we going to do why not
revolutionize the whole benefit system
by underpinning it with distributive
ledger technology who knows what DLT is
I did until I got into this space that&#39;s
for another talk but the potential to
revolutionize what we do across the
whole of our benefit system underpin
hmrc the tax people with artificial
intelligence
why not because again what we have here
is the possibility to do stuff in such a
different way barriers to entry gon cost
of experimentation gone
we need to reimagine experimentation and
we need to fundamentally forget
everything that we&#39;ve been taught about
failure it&#39;s not failure its
experimentation roots on a journey to a
potential point that we may not even
know when we start that journey
reimagining that as leaders how do we go
about this we have the potential because
costs have been taken out of the model
what can we do should be the start point
to all of this artificial intelligence I
got involved with I figured I didn&#39;t
have enough of my own I should get some
of this artificial stuff what we can do
with that in public policy in the
private sector across the whole piece
but again by us in the black box if that
artificial intelligence is made up of
data sets which are bias in them then
the box will just replicate and do that
bias on heat if we had artificial
intelligence a century ago it would most
likely be racist sexist homophobic
disabled list the whole shebang because
the fundamental principle everything and
nothing changes it&#39;s still potentially
garbage in garbage out disruption
disruption disruption but what if
time to be alive I learnt the power of
disruption at an early age when I was 14
I went to bed one night and when I woke
up I couldn&#39;t see I&#39;d lost my sight
overnight everything and nothing changed
I was blind but the dreams I&#39;ve had
since being a little kid still remain
the same everything changed in terms of
the tools that I would use to do stuff
getting my books my schoolbooks on
cassette tape rather than in print so I
could content continue carry on
everything and nothing changes let&#39;s go
to the ethics to the essence of how we
need to be to thrive to push forward and
as individuals and as a nation to be
brilliant in this fourth Industrial
Revolution and it doesn&#39;t come down to
having phenomenal knowledge of a
particular bit of technology it comes
down to this connection and
collaboration safety and security
responsibility and reciprocity
transparency and Trust the things that
have always underpinned any human
society when it is at its best the pace
of change is phenomenal throwing back to
my previous sporting career I say to all
of you today don&#39;t sit back don&#39;t even
just lean in dive in thank you very much
[Applause]
