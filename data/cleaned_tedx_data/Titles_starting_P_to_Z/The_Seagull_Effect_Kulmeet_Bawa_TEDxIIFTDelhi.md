a very good afternoon and thanks for
that brief but generous introduction
it&#39;s an it&#39;s an absolute pleasure to be
here and what I&#39;m going to do over the
next few minutes is talk to you or or
share certain thoughts you know stuff
that is worked for me over the years and
let&#39;s see probably there would be some
stuff that you could mull over and may
make sense for you so let me let me step
back and first share with you or tell
you about one of my most prized
possessions till today so it was a book
a small little book which was gifted to
me by my father when I was about 13 or
14 years of age
it&#39;s called Jonathan Livingston Seagull
right a single as you can see there and
the author is a gentleman called Richard
Bach now the book still stands at the
corner of my bookshelf in my home till
today and of course it was extremely
powerful because the learnings that I
took from it the thoughts that I took
from it actually ended up in shaping my
life and to be fair I think I would have
read the book more than a dozen times
over the past three decades and the
magic of it is that every time I read it
there is something new that actually
cropped up there are some new learnings
something that I didn&#39;t fathom or I
couldn&#39;t get when I last read it or in
the previous stage of my life so the
story is about a young bird a young
seagull whose name is Jonathan
Livingston and Jonathan is somewhat of a
contrary in&#39; if I could call him that
Jonathan goes against the existing norms
of seagull society if there is something
called a seagull Society he goes against
those norms he is out to seek his higher
purpose in life and he becomes best at
doing what he loves the most so the book
goes on to tell us how exactly to live
your life even if you are a contrary
even if your views do not match the
norms of society the norms of
neighborhood the norms of a flock the
norms of a tribe whichever way you look
at it and it tells you about the journey
that you face when you are stepping onto
something like this something that&#39;s
against the grain against the norm the
kind of people you meet some of them
would adore you some would despise you
some would call you devil some would
call you God that&#39;s how strong and
powerful it is so here&#39;s what it did to
me I began to Ravel in the philosophy
that my life is mine to own every single
moment every single day I could actually
catch hold of it shape it it&#39;s more like
clay you know I could shape it into the
manner that I wanted they were no rights
or wrongs I could play with it exactly
the way I wanted every decision that I
took thereafter till today is always the
right decision so there is nothing
called wrong decisions so like I said
and why I call this the antigravity just
checking the clicker so why the
antigravity
because the analogy here for me is
gravity is fear and failure something
that stays with us all through our lives
it never it never goes away and
anti-gravity is the vision or the dreams
that we have which is something like the
context or the evoke inspire what you
have is the theme for this right so what
I&#39;ll do like I said is I&#39;ll give you
some of my thoughts stuff that has
worked for me and hopefully it would
form the base of what the future holds
for me so The Seagull effect is
essentially the manner in which I was
affected by this book and continue to
use it at leisure and at pleasure to
shape my life so talking about the first
thing which is vision and I have only
two big themes to talk about today so
first is the vision and I will not go
deep into why you need a vision and why
you need to dream etc I think they are
all very clear that you don&#39;t have a big
picture if you don&#39;t have a vision
chances are you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re
headed
chances are you may get caught up in the
weeds at some stage so to have a vision
to
a dream a big dream is critical having
put that aside one of the big things
that I have learned and I talk about is
something called state a state is who
you are it is what you are it is your
being it is your intrinsic being if I
can call it that so the state is what
you are when you walk onto a stage when
you walk into a boardroom of any walk
into a classroom it&#39;s the unsent
communication
it&#39;s the unsaid words that speak for
themselves and you could always tweak it
you could be excited you could be
passionate you could be somber or you
could be sad right so there are
different kinds of states that you have
but why is state so important and why am
i connecting it to vision a state is
paramount because a state dictates what
kind of a vision
what kind of dreams you are capable of
having are you ready to get into
uncharted territory
are you ready ready to falter and fail
all of that gets determined by your
state so if you are in a state of
confidence if you are in a state of
excitement passion chances are that you
will push the envelope you&#39;ll push the
envelope you&#39;ll get into areas which are
brand-new for you you&#39;ll get into areas
which are brand-new for people and you
would expand yourself so talking further
about state state is something that is
intrinsic it is internal it is part of
you having said that it doesn&#39;t mean
that state cannot be changed state can
definitely be changed and and it could
it could be an hour of talk if I was to
start talking about how you change your
state but simply put it&#39;s what I call
the reality conversation so if you came
sitting here decide that you want to get
into an excited state or a passionate
state you would actually start
distinguishing your reality from the
little voice or the sounds or the
conversation that we go on that goes on
within ourself right so if you can learn
to distinguish that you can learn to
actually change your state or become
conscious of your state then again one
of the other ways is something called
context or perspective context is
paramount context is decisive so if you
can change the way you look at something
as simply as that you can change your
state
and the last thing about state is state
has what I call a contagion factor it is
infectious it has a contagion factor
because state can spread so if I&#39;m
excited if I&#39;m passionate chances are
that my team&#39;s chances are that people
in the auditorium would get excited so
state has a contagion factor and you
always see it the best when you know
before any match when you see a coach
talking to his team or the captain
talking to his team or from from the
world I come from you know before the
next battle that you go into or the next
hill that you want to take so you would
actually motivate get your team excited
get your men excited move into a
different realm which is state and then
you go and get victories like you&#39;ve
never seen earlier so state is critical
to summarize because state actually
dictates how big you can dream your
passion and how you can actually push
the envelope or the boundaries the
second thing as far as vision is
concerned and something that I observe
very carefully and speak about it very
often is all of us are brilliant all of
us are brilliant in at looking at life
in retrospect joining the dots and then
saying wow I&#39;ve really been a huge
success okay and the good part about
this is that all of us here every single
person in the world actually why this
auditorium is a hero is a genius when we
look back at life in retrospect and join
the dots there&#39;s no way in hell that you
can fail because you will always get the
pieces of the puzzle together but how
about actually looking at it the
converse can you put a stake in the
ground can you actually push the context
can you put something in the vision
something that you don&#39;t have something
that no one&#39;s done can you actually
reinvent the is or whatever is the
status quo and then start working
backwards in solving for it you find
that the power that you have in life in
your career as a student grows up
exponentially if you start to work like
that so put the vision plant it there
start working with the end in mind and
then see how this whole thing unfold its
its sheer magic that unfolds and lastly
of course
the state and so so what&#39;s the vision
what&#39;s the big picture how do you dream
how do you actually formulate a vision
so in my parlance probably something
that I&#39;ve almost paid ain&#39;t it if I
could call it that is simple think big
think crazy think stupid think so crazy
that you know you yourself get a little
shocked at the way you&#39;re thinking or
the kind of vision that you&#39;re
formulating the the vision should be so
overwhelming for anyone that hears of it
and that&#39;s the start point for you post
that how do you move ahead with that
vision what do you actually do are you
capable of dreaming with your eyes open
can you actually when you formulate a
vision think about can you be the first
in the world to do something that&#39;s a
that&#39;s a big one can you be the first in
the world to do something and and the
best part is you don&#39;t need to know how
to do it you just need to know how to
dream it that&#39;s the big thing about
vision connecting that the other big
thing is how do you actually start
voicing or declaring that vision so you
formulated a vision you think it&#39;s big
it&#39;s absolutely kick-ass how do you
actually start converting into reality
and one of my big learnings is that you
need to go and voice it in the open get
on to a stage like this get in with your
teams get into your classroom and
actually voice it and when you voice it
when you voice that with that vision it
starts becoming real it actually starts
getting a shape and you find people like
you people all across you your society
starts working with you to realize that
vision so that was all about vision and
state and just the one last aspect all
of this needs to be simple the simpler
the better the less the jog on the
better and that&#39;s one of the big
learnings that I&#39;ve had over the years
so moving on and I said you know it is
it is anti-gravity force okay so like I
said gravity is fear and failure stuff
that will pull you down and the
antigravity is the vision that we just
spoke about your dreams in the vision so
now moving on to the gravity portion
which is fear and failure and
and very simply put and I started with
it failure and fear or something that
will remain with you till the last days
of your life whether you&#39;re a student
whether in a classroom whether you&#39;re in
a b-school like this whether you&#39;re in
the real world whether I was in the army
whether you&#39;re on an operation or a
mission it stays with you at any given
time you will always have butterflies
but the big part and the one single
thing that I talk about very often is
start playing for failure consciously
start playing for failure if you&#39;re not
failing five seven eight ten times a
week there&#39;s something wrong
you&#39;re not playing enough you&#39;re not
pushing the boundaries you&#39;re sitting
you&#39;re sitting in a in a spot where you
are comfortable you&#39;re sitting in a
comfort zone you refuse to walk into
uncharted territories or troubled waters
because you are comfortable and you will
never expand the horizon unless you get
comfortable with failure simple the
other part to failure at the way the way
I&#39;ve worked on it
over the years is there has to be let me
let me let me see how I worded giving a
second so so you know it&#39;s a saying that
was very close to me over the years it
says that a ship in the harbor is safe
but that is not what ships are built for
right so you have to get into uncharted
territories troubled waters like I said
that is what builds the resilience that
is what helps shape you to what you are
if you don&#39;t do that you would be
sitting with a me-too strategy following
a ground that someone else has actually
laid out following a track or a beaten
track that has been laid out by someone
else
so actually venture forth into troubled
waters and you will succeed like never
before or at least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve
learned over the years okay so the last
thing that I would like to talk about
here in this portion is about fear and I
said fear in failure
typically move hand in hand we all have
fear fear is to me fear can never be
conquered right at the maximum you can
actually cross the chasm of fear as I
call it move to the other side and
continue with life continue to start
that game and then it depends whether
you fail or succeed but fear is
something that can never be conquer
don&#39;t even try and conquer it it&#39;s just
something that you can step across cross
the chasm cross the valley call it what
you want get to the other side and start
playing the game and that&#39;s all that
there is about fear and I remember I&#39;ve
been fearful I&#39;ve been I can I could go
on for hours telling you about my fears
okay so it&#39;s not that because I&#39;m
standing here there are no fears or they
never were fears I remember one of the
time then I was most petrified
perhaps in my life was I was about 16 or
17 16 and a half years of age and I was
in the National Defense Academy or the
NDA and one of the things that is
mandated by the NDA is that by the time
you&#39;re in the second or third term you
need to actually go and jump from what
is called the 10 meter board so for
those of you who are swimmers or follow
swimming the highest board that you have
where divers dive from is the 10 meter
board so it was mandatory for us and if
you don&#39;t do it you could lose six
months you could get relegated now that
was perhaps one of the biggest ordeals
that I have ever faced it was the
biggest nightmare how do you actually
climb up virtually to your death right
and then what happens is when you
actually get on to the plank or the
diving board as you call it it starts
shaking and you have nothing there&#39;s no
cement there&#39;s nothing to hold on to and
you&#39;re actually virtually walking the
plank and you reach the edge and the
board is swinging and here&#39;s what you
need to do you see the water far away
below you right and the board is
swinging and you are supposed to take
that next step and fall into the water
which is absolutely petrifying until you
do it for the first time and once you do
it you fall into the water you go deep
down you surface after some time gasping
for breath and you realize that the
water never really hurt you
the water is there to actually embrace
you and then you do it the second time
and the third time and the fourth time
and that&#39;s what it is about fear so you
need to cross the chasm you need to get
on to the other side and that&#39;s how and
you
now the analogy and the book that I&#39;ve
read so Jonathan had a vision in this
book that why could I not die from 8000
feet and his mother told him seagulls
are not meant to do that
seagulls are not meant to stall it&#39;s
blasphemy it&#39;s the same you can&#39;t do
that John and yet he does it and he
practices and practices virtually gets
too near death till the time he succeeds
just another thought and it&#39;s sporadic
so how do you actually get used to
failing okay and this is something very
close to my heart
I call it start formulating little games
start playing the little games where the
stakes are not very high and why I use
the word games is a game ends up in a
winner and a loser
the stakes are not high you know that
one party will win and the other party
will lose so start playing little games
with your life and what I mean by that
it could be something as simple let me
come up with something so it could be
something as simple as one of you
wanting to learn the guitar and becoming
part of the school or the college band
right so you say next six months I want
to learn the guitar and I want to be
part of the college band or it could be
for those of us who&#39;ve never run more
than 500 meters in your entire life you
could actually take on that I want to be
part of a marathon I want to run the
next airtel marathon and I want to come
in the top 50 now that&#39;s a small little
game give yourself for time and I could
go on so keep building those little
games where you&#39;re sitting where they
are in college whether you&#39;re in the
army radio in the corporate world
whether you&#39;re in the boardroom
irrespective of geographies and what
that does is it teaches you to fail it
teaches you to fail when stakes are
small you get into the habit of failing
and guys the amount you learn when you
fail is probably exponentially higher
than when you succeed because when you
succeed you&#39;re perched pretty feeling
good about yourself
victorious right and when you fail you
actually get back to the drawing board
and understand
hey what went wrong how do i improve so
get into the habit of failing and yes so
let me let me let me end let me actually
end and let me tell you about
let me tell you about something that I
heard something that was that was as
erratic as me at times something that I
heard many years ago in one of the
forums that I actually attended so let
me step back a lot of us sit here like
my friend here a lot of us sit here
thinking that our present is who we are
in the present today is actually because
of what we faced in the past so a cool
Mita is here today because I school here
this is the way I grew up this is the
cultural nuances this is the economics
trainer that I actually came from and so
you know all of that the city I was I
was talking to Joseph who&#39;s from
alleppey in Kerala now all of that has
shaped me to be Who I am today so the
past is responsible for my present so
here&#39;s the here&#39;s the weird one your
past has nothing to do with who you are
in the present it has absolutely nothing
it is the future that you&#39;re living into
that actually shapes and determines who
you are I say it again so it is the
future that you&#39;re living into that
actually gives you your present and let
me explain the way they had explained it
to me it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the best
learnings that I&#39;ve had in my life so we
love going on our holidays which which
most of you do vacation time I have a
family I have two girls and here&#39;s what
I notice whether it&#39;s an holiday in
Hawaii or or or the back waters of
Kerala for Joseph what happens is that
you booked your tickets a few weeks or a
few months or a couple of months in
advance and you then have that future
that you&#39;re living in to you have that
vision that you&#39;re going after that you
know I am going for a holiday to to
Hawaii or to or to Kerala and just
observe what happens or what transpires
in those two or three weeks there is an
excitement in the family there is an
excitement with the children there&#39;s an
excitement with you and in that duration
the excitement sometimes gets so much
that kids would love to have their bags
open in their room three weeks before
going they would come in and since
they&#39;re girls they would come in and put
it in a dress take out the same one but
in a new one the next day put in shades
put in a hat and that&#39;s where the
excitement becomes palpable
and you&#39;re actually living in an excited
world weeks before the future is
actually hit you because you&#39;re actually
living for that future so it is the
future that determines your present your
state everything that I spoke about
today is determined by the future and
what is future in today&#39;s parlance
future is nothing but your vision future
is nothing but your dreams so back to
the point dream big dream crazy do crazy
stuff grow against the norms it&#39;s
perfect it&#39;s your life it&#39;s your life to
shape it&#39;s your life to mold there is no
right or wrong it is your decision
finally and every decision that you take
is right so thanks a lot thanks for the
patient hearing and all the best for the
rest of your time here and for the real
world once you get out and are very
happy the value of course to all of you
thanks a lot
[Music]
you
