hello guys hiya tonight
are you good come on give now good are
you good okay
super good I&#39;m super happy to be here
thanks for coming and actually the fact
of coming here is really interesting
because I have ever happened to you that
your face
called you to go out and you like I
called you later
because you don&#39;t know if you really
want to go out I&#39;m going to never call
back because you were just eating cereal
or watching TV
however happen to you so actually taking
the decision to say yes or no texting
your brain 0.04 milliseconds which means
they&#39;re actually going your friends call
you and they&#39;ll tell you hey let&#39;s hang
out and you will be like I&#39;m sorry you
want him now but the logic would tell
you you don&#39;t want to be rude so you
tell them to call them later and the
next day of course they know are going
to ask you what do you think came out
because they knew you were going to
watch TV and you don&#39;t want to go out so
anytime we take a decision in their
lives it&#39;s really hard to say yes or no
but our brain is really smart we are
guided by our animal sense by our
rational sense human beings still being
animals but actually we&#39;re still being
every time no logical every time a
virtual human beings is there all the
species in the world that actually we
can destroy each other in the same way
that we can build each other we have so
below we have survived the first word
single word people standing here shimmer
and we still building things our brain
has a power to create thing I don&#39;t know
if you think about someone who saw the
moon and then now we&#39;re going to Mars
someone who thought about and being
closer so one no we have
the phone so what are to want it to go
faster to a place and we have the car so
we have the power to create your brain
or brain take us through difficulties in
life helps us to remind moments and to
create better moments also it helped us
a lot to extractions that is actually
100 percent of logical thought the best
an incredible of them all that is
actually creation who is good here are
doing something weird whatever that is I
mean maybe thinking about something
creating something who makes dancing so
an extensive singing painting doing
something sports anything
I&#39;ll bet each one of you like something
different from the rest of the world and
that belongs to your brain but now in
our age we are more related to how our
brain is related to virtualization it
means to technology human beings have a
bottle such a way that we look to enjoy
time but action will look to show time
so we have created a lot of devices a
lot of things to make time shorter and
get to places faster and actually leave
faster that&#39;s what big to Alsatian in
your lives is about we have created the
phone we have created the Facebook we
have created so many things through
technology to be happier to make more
money to make better decisions and
actually to be happier to feel better
with ourselves but the thing about time
these days is that we have a power to be
inside or outside of time we have a
meeting with our friends but at the same
time we&#39;re checking the phone to see the
place we just left that is just home we
are going on vacation because we wanted
to be outside of the city we actually
we&#39;re checking the
purely to see who is in the city or
actually was running away of our
internship or our job and we&#39;re checking
out to see how the place which is left
so this generation our generation is a
place of lifestyle when we are making
this hard position because the pain
starts happening on technology and
dependence is actually happening in real
life all generations appear with the
last ones have a level of adaptation of
ten times more and actually the previous
four generations will be actually blown
with the DNA of technology which means
that sometimes we have to help our
parents to check the phone or to help
them with Aguas support that we shot but
actually the next generations maybe four
or five timers they wouldn&#39;t need that
because actually they will be born
learning already
with the adjourn with the DNA of how
technology is going to work how things
are actually happening allowed them
without any need of getting instructions
so nowadays tonight is taking a path in
our lives who is here around 20 years
old 20 years old

24:18 under 18 25 25 years old
okay good to know so the thing about us
is that from here to the next 10-15
years all the things are going to be
placed in your lives human body is not
controlled by robotics so we have a lot
of devices that can supplant each of one
of the part of our body we have
artificial intelligence that actually
has to do with a human brain because
every time we go out to the real world
all being has a capacity to absorb 1
million bytes of information at a time
evenings are actually six milliseconds
and actually all brain is the only
machine in the world that has the power
to process six billion of bits of
information and actually it can relocate
what information we know what means we
doesn&#39;t know and actually what things we
can learn from the environment we are
living we have also imagined processes
that has to do with human vision this is
really new nowadays if anyone is
interested human vision has tech
capacity of take us to places we don&#39;t
know and in the future we will check the
capacity of take us to any place without
moving or bodies from anywhere we have
photography on aesthetics that is one of
my main specializations that is actually
how we make life around and how the fact
of you being here and you imagine
something about you seeing a picture can
take you to a really life experiences
without you being juice washing picture
of something we have also phantoms and
microchips that is actually a mimic of
how real brain works and when I was
telling you about taking decisions but
how microchips are going to do in the
future we also have human imaginations
human community that is Second Life if
any of you have placing it also has to
do with social media if any of you have
Facebook or Instagram or snapchat tinder
even it has Second Life and we have
human environment that now is taken by
built or reality if any of you have gone
to an arcade or beach troll game I will
recommend you to go because I will
really really really maybe experience
about the future so in a generation we
have the average person around twenty
and thirty years have an average of five
brothers in the internet most of them
are related to supply or basic needs
eating socializing sex the
we still being animals even if we don&#39;t
and even if we have a lot of technology
we&#39;re still having to feet and to get or
basically it&#39;s done so in the way that
we try to get all these on the Internet
we have an evolution of what is right
here right now or what&#39;s coming on this
transition we have for example we&#39;re
asking for pics online but we still have
in the pics a guy who is coming to
deliver a pizza to us we are not on the
level of having a machines that comes
and be the picture to house on an
average life I mean normal human being
and a lifetime of 70 years this is a
time we spend doing things we spend
seven years eight months watching TV I
mean that&#39;s a lot of TV we have would
spend three years five months eating and
drinking we spend one year ten months
gloomy and getting beautiful even if
it&#39;s curse of guys and we&#39;re spending
six more months doing laundry what is
interesting is that we spent five years
four months in a lifetime on social
media but we spend only one year three
months actually socializing going
outside seeing people talking laughing
kissing whatever you want to do reading
doing actually stuff in real life
so let&#39;s been actually more time former
terms of social media are not only bad
on five years four month we can fly 22
times to the moon and back we can walk
the Great Wall shine up three times we
got - games of trolls 250 times we can
climb the Everest 32 times we can go to
10,000 marathons we can walk or jog
3,000 times so actually what are we
doing with our real life where we are on
the Internet every time we are on our
own we are playing
a habit and this habit is expanding a
lot actually last year in passive Valley
is already the first clinic for people
who is addicted today internet and in
China we have already four clinics of
people who is addicted to the internet
because actually it&#39;s chronic on these
days in job people so the Internet has a
lot to do with virtualization has 100%
with virtualization because it&#39;s
symmetric what makes things easier for
us but it&#39;s also our stress HD an
addiction a stress because you are
studying the whole weekend meanwhile
your friends are crying and sometimes
they get the a and you don&#39;t so of
course also it caused addictions and
entity because you have this pressure of
these people look nice these people is
having a good life these people is doing
less or making more money and I&#39;m just
trying here to do something with my life
hello but at the same time it great
security there&#39;s not freedom and
influence because every one of us asked
something special to say every one of us
in real life have something magical or
boom have the power to aport something
to the rest of society and that&#39;s
something that no any machine can do and
no machine will ever do that because
machines is proof they can develop their
language but they cannot mix feelings
and logic as we do the internet and any
machine we know the form the car and
going to the moon everything we have
around us everything that we create is
made for productivity it&#39;s for make our
life easier is to make us earn more
money is to make a save time to make us
happier Anisa it&#39;s not a decision to
understand why am i doing with my what
am i doing with my time what am i doing
with my resources how am i using all
these magical tools are I have now and I
still having in the future too
laughs I want to do the least I wanted
you whatever you want to do if you want
to be famous if you want to have a lot
of money if you want to have a good
company if you only want to be a CEO of
a company in the future
all the instruments that you have about
technology are there to help you to
arrange that would you need to know that
time is variable and time is better if
you learn how to use the things you have
around that&#39;s good if you create habit
of learning what tools you have and that
was the average person that has five
profiles in the internet as to Hana told
me that she used Facebook and lived in a
lot I use Instagram and Facebook a lot
the average people is only more
efficient and better in the first two
social medias are stay use so actually
the first two social medias that you use
the most are what defines you the most
and that&#39;s something that I think
everybody should check and then about
creating habits we have really good
manners about how to deal with social
media we have facebook we have Instagram
if we need a job we go on LinkedIn
if we need a big cigar maybe we use
Foursquare any other ABP we have so we
build ourselves around how the internet
and how big predation works but thanks
one habit that we have and it&#39;s really
dangerous for for us is the habit of
staring our phones because actually the
only the LED light of the phones gives
you an impact your conscious brain that
we never realized but we always are like
ashes of washing the phone and then when
nobody brushes like him when nobody
helps grind me today and naturally is
your psychological psychological needs
of washing your phone I used to have
really really hard
trying to fall asleep for a long time
because I was watching my phone the
whole time before falling asleep and
that&#39;s a problem that many people is
having nowadays but a few people is
realizing that is really bad and
sometimes when you go to see your phone
and you scroll under notifications you
actually forget why you have your phone
in hand because you were going to do
something else so I think we&#39;re
developing habits that we should look up
because mutuality is good Internet is
good but we need to wash out over
ourselves how am I using this Joe
am I using this is this beneficial for
my time or I&#39;m getting frustrated of the
life I don&#39;t have because I am not
learning or creating a habit of how to
use the tools I can be using for
something better so we start browsing
sometimes without knowing why or we are
just looking for people information or
looking for another stuff from the
internet without no reason why and
actually we start wasting the best
currency that we have in your life there
is time doing nothing so I think is a
special and it&#39;s important to reflect
first to learn how to use the tools we
have because the profession is going to
come to every part of our lives in the
next 10 years seconds to learn that if
we to understand that if we learn how to
use them we can actually experience
different happiness I started turning
off my phone two hours before going to
sleep and I start going to the gym those
two hours and then I don&#39;t see my phone
three hours after going to sleep and
actually I feel good about that
I feel happy about training before going
to sleep and one of my best friends she
turned off the phone she she drew off
the a beast that actually allow her to
make social interactions for five hours
so she can talk
Marren and she proved five times more in
the way she was painting before only in
six months because she realized that
actually
performance in real life was happy help
better other days she was doing her best
well reality wasn&#39;t actually being that
effective and that good for her
the only thing is that you can deliver
higher level of results if you
understand why are you using this I&#39;m
actually you are honest with yourself
you are using Facebook because you have
fired from your family you are using
Tina because you want to find someone
but you&#39;re super bad updating you are
using minidom because actually you want
to move from the song you are so if you
understand why are you using these tools
and then you realize that our other
tools that doesn&#39;t work for your life
you can actually have a better
performance with yourself and then
you&#39;re gonna start having a better time
productivity on time are two things are
actually really really really difference
between the people who are successful
are the people who is not and behave it
that we have for us time and
productivity is their only be for
instant makes the people who really make
it lead when they hand outside of
University and the people that actually
stand of the back so I encourage you
tonight to think about how you&#39;re using
your time I remember that the problem of
time is not that is forgiving is that
for sure we pay for how we use it thank
you
[Applause]
