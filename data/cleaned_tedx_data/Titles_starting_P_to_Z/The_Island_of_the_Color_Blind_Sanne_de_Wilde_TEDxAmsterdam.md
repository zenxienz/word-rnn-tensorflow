one step beyond welcome this is a
special place things look different here
the flowers exist only in one color and
lighter and in darker shades and it&#39;s
not only the flowers but also the trees
the ocean the river
your face your hands and this island
color does not exist welcome to the
island of the colorblind 250 years ago a
disaster struck the island a typhoon
washed over pinga lap something must
have angered the highest spirit isso pal
almost everything on the island was
destroyed only 20 people survived one of
them was a king and another was his wife
the Queen when the spirit is so power
saw the Queen he fell in love with her
he started to visit her at night and
they had children and their children
shunned the light and everything they
saw was black and white but at night
they seemed to see better like their
ghostly father I&#39;d like to ask you to
close your eyes for a moment just a
short moment try to remember the green
of palm tree leaves try to imagine the
blue of the ocean can you recall what
color the person next to you is wearing
open your eyes I told you the myths of
Pingel up but Pingel up is not a
fictional place Bingle up is real it&#39;s a
tiny island hidden deep in the Pacific
Ocean the well-known neurologist and
writer Oliver Sacks
wrote a book about it called the island
of the color blind I have found out
about the island because I was talking
on Belgium radio and about like how
genetics influence people&#39;s life how
this inspires me and someone wrote me an
email saying I have a story for you and
that&#39;s how the story found me sometimes
an idea sparks your mind and Lee
angers in the back of your head glowing
like a shiny thought Sparkle and that&#39;s
how ping alap came to me I was told the
island tale and instantly felt I had to
plug the shooting star out of the sky
hold on to it care for it and let it
guide me in oliver sexes book he
describes the two communities in pinga
lap and pompay to Micronesian islands
where there&#39;s an extremely high
percentage of achromatopsia
achromatopsia is a very rare genetic
condition that causes complete color
blindness
I named my photo book the island of the
color blind in reference of his work my
project the island of the colorblind
consists consists of three types of
images as achromatopsia consists of
three characteristics extreme light
sensitivity poor vision and the complete
inability to distinguish color a krumitz
in Micronesia they don&#39;t have access to
means of aid like sunglasses or tinted
lenses so they deal with their limited
vision by blinking and squinting their
eyes shielding their face and
positioning themselves according to
light sources they&#39;re dazzled by
daylight blinded by sunlight the world
appears to them as a burned-out image an
overexposed picture I worked with a
camera converted to infrared
I shot images and infrared to rediscover
color while shooting to reinvent this
idea of color to metaphorically create
an imaginary image of what the world
could look like inside a colorblind mind
if you can&#39;t see color everything is
possible in this photo project I also
worked with photo paintings and normal
black and white images I want to invite
you to embrace this richness of vision
what do you see if someone blushes what
if you only saw the world in just one
color
what if green could be purple and purple
could be red and red could be orange and
orange could be
a world without color you smell you feel
you know can you dream in color when you
live in black and white what would you
miss the most I invited the colorblind
people to bring color back into my black
and white images to paint straight onto
the photos it was often a very intimate
experience for them as it brought them
back to the very first moment they were
confronted with the fact they couldn&#39;t
see color when in school they would draw
or paint and their teacher would point
out they weren&#39;t using the right colors
the Sun isn&#39;t purple it&#39;s yellow one of
the people I worked with described his
childhood experience to me how when his
teachers and his parents is covered they
wouldn&#39;t be able to teach him color they
came up with the idea of labeling his
colored pencils so as soon as he was old
enough to read he could actually color
their son yellow instead of purple at
first he felt very proud but afterwards
he realized what did it really matter
what&#39;s wrong with a purple son
let&#39;s open up to new possibilities new
perspectives new ways of seeing why not
why not have purple rain&#39; blue velvet
back to black golden brown things are in
black and white but what if they
literally were how would you color the
world with your mind if you could
repaint it color is just a word to those
who cannot see it we bring ideas to life
we give IDs meaning by the words we use
this is the power of words but what if
color is just a word I once heard a
story of a little boy who told his mom
he needed to have the exact same haircut
as his best friend he got all excited by
this idea of then going to school the
next morning and his teacher wouldn&#39;t be
able to tell him and his best buddy
apart because of their identical haircut
he didn&#39;t realize he had a different
skin color than his best friend he
wasn&#39;t distracted or diverted by color
he wasn&#39;t conditioned
to see the differences and therefore he
didn&#39;t even see them he just saw things
for what they were he saw him for what
he was his best friend an equal soul it
seems like when I worked with the people
with achromatopsia they felt so
vulnerable to paint to not have control
over color to let go of something they
tried so badly to control you try to
teach yourself something you might not
be able to learn
they seemed conditioned to see the world
as we color seeing people see it this is
a call to embrace the diversity of
seeing and this diversity of being it
seems inherent to people to fear change
yet to live in a world that is
constantly changing the next image
you&#39;ll see is the image of the island
this sums it all up for me this tropical
backdrop almost like a surreal painting
of bubblegum pink trees and deep ocean
blue this boat full of Penelope&#39;s
colorblind represents people setting off
for a better future these Islanders
amongst many others living in a place
for nerble to the water exposed to the
sea will live to be a generation of
environmental refugees as a sea levels
keep rising and this matter becomes more
and more pressing this is a real threat
for people I love I came to deeply love
this blinking and squinting eyed
community they welcomed me with flowers
treated me like a princess they helped
me experience experience the island in
every possible way they made me drink
fresh coconut and kava made of the
pounded Sokka root cinnamon bark tea
they made me chew the beetle nut and eat
dog meat
I was declared part of the family many
people are forced to undertake
life-threatening journeys they have to
leave everything they know behind to
then end up in a place where they&#39;re
unwelcome I&#39;m extremely lucky because I
have the freedom of choice I choose to
travel I choose to go where I go and to
be where I am not everyone has this
luxury let&#39;s focus on color
might make the world a more colorful
place I&#39;d like to end with this quote by
my Micronesian uncle at Albert welcome
to the family once and for all united we
stand divided we fall
thank you or to say it in Penelope&#39;s
gallon
