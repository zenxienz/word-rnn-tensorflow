hello people I hope you are all doing
well salami and ass each other into
cuisine stopping for one second just
think about what you believe of me that
was a fake accent I just through there
yeah sometimes stereotypes are what we
view seems to somewhat seem like it&#39;s
almost the truth but it&#39;s never really
the truth so sometimes you have to like
put that aside and try to actually know
who you&#39;re talking to let me illustrate
how throughout my life I made people
rethink how they viewed me I was born in
Sudan at the age of 2 I moved to Egypt
there I learn how to speak Arabic and
the different dialects that came along
with it at the age of 5 I moved here to
the United States I thought nothing
could ever really define me as a person
that was until I really found out that
people did label me yeah they thought
they thought I would be the person or
well let me hear that&#39;s poured onto my
life I were really amusing clothes so I
wore dashikis and gel ideas I don&#39;t
think any of you know what those are so
you can imagine their faces when I first
walked in with a dashiki into my
kindergartner class and then all the
other kids are just staring at me like
oh my god African royalty and it&#39;s just
like no first of all I&#39;m not I really
wish I was but that would be really it&#39;d
be really amazing you see my brother
actually took advantage of that and it
worked out really well
[Laughter]
sorry okay I went on and I started to
realize that other people started to
just start asking really hilarious
questions like does your language have
clicking noises like the movie like the
Bushmen in the movies gotten must be
crazy
I&#39;m like no not at all and the funniest
question I&#39;ve ever gotten was do you
live in a hut or have you ever lived in
a hut and I have yet to even see one so
I think that&#39;s really amazing don&#39;t you
guys stereotypes work out really funny
because I remember the first year of
school and kids just thought I was a
regular kid and so like yeah you know my
clothes and then I had to change that
because I found out what winter was and
it wasn&#39;t really polite to me Tywin at
all like it progressed and I started
changing I moved to Kansas City Missouri
and I started kind of figuring out the
norms so that was flat build hats baggy
chinos large shirts and then as I
thought I was kind of like getting used
to things
I moved again to Des Moines Iowa the
kids there thought I was a bug I was
like what I&#39;m only like six years old I
can&#39;t be a bug
so I thought it was really hilarious
guys and then to top that off I thought
I was really an ordinary American my
English became clear and like I
struggled really hard to make it like to
actually get English on to the point
because I remember when they asked us
what we ate at home I mixed up a corn
with corn I was like yeah we eat acorns
and the kids were like you yeah I was
like yeah we&#39;re not a family of
squirrels so don&#39;t worry about
and then time we&#39;ve gone again so I
moved again to to Des Moines Iowa yeah
kids thought I was a tag Yatta Yatta
Yatta
I picked up the trend of clothes that&#39;s
there so it was Hollister American Eagle
it was somewhat of preppy somewhat of a
preppy school and then I moved back here
number-two Nebraska right the kids here
really hilarious they&#39;re like dude
you&#39;re whitewashed I was like what and
like I had like these two extremes where
I was a thug and then I was whitewashed
and I thought those are really amazing
guys because how often are you told hey
man you look like a thug and then five
seconds later you told hey you&#39;re
whitewashed why are you that whitewashed
I&#39;m like how how can I be labeled
whitewashed I found out it was the way
that I started dressing the way I spoke
and came out to people that&#39;s the way
people labeled me and I think it made me
stronger because I was starting to be
proud of who I was because when you
first come to the United States it&#39;s
like a melting pot where you&#39;re just
trying to catch on to every single
culture and become an ordinary American
because I mean isn&#39;t that the dream to
be an American but yeah I learned to be
myself and I thought I was finally okay
with labeling correct and then I went to
this leadership economics program I UCLA
and the kids there we&#39;re all like lined
up and then they did roll call they
called Gow by the name my name is by the
way my name is go so they&#39;re all looking
for an Asian kid which I thought was
really hilarious I raised my hand I was
just like here they seem to be waiting
for like they they all seemed to be way
for my need to be like Jerome I was like
what and they and like the funniest part
was I didn&#39;t like that part to me faze
me is just the fact that I told them I
grew up in Nebraska oh my god it&#39;s just
so hilarious because they asked me do
you have electricity
it&#39;s like butts and like some of them
were so confused where Nebraska was
there are you guys close to Minnesota
like up there are you guys liked by
Canada I&#39;m like no we&#39;re like dead
center like have you never traveled
there
well Chicago I&#39;ve been there I&#39;m like
well it&#39;s right by there no I don&#39;t
think so it&#39;s what they told me like
okay but I learned to just be myself
guys because I mean when you choose to
label someone you&#39;re choosing smallness
over greatness I mean I think the
campaign last year it was like make
America great again we&#39;re not making
each other great if we&#39;re choosing to
label each other
we&#39;re just stereotype each other and can
find each other in boxes they kept
putting me in boxes like bees and I keep
breaking out of them showing them I&#39;m
nothing like that I mean who would you
be if the world give you a box you check
who would you truly be I mean you could
only be yourself right that&#39;s who we
should all pride ourself to be rethink
how the world views you rethink your how
you&#39;re labeled don&#39;t let it offend you
find joy in it a lot because I find it
really Larry&#39;s just telling people yeah
I build an electric longboard they&#39;re
like what and like yeah and then they&#39;re
like you&#39;re a nerd I&#39;m like okay but and
just really I really just I don&#39;t know
how to explain it it&#39;s just the that
would be like the feeling you get of
just proving someone wrong I think
that&#39;s like the best feeling in the
world and I live for that guys so I
would go out of my way to meet new
people and it should introduce myself
sometimes I kind of wear like different
clothes to kind of throw them off you
know and it works most of the time and
I&#39;ll throw on an accent the funny part
of actually growing up in Egypt though
is I picked up in here back soon so I
could do that really well and I sound
like cab driver and like New York or
something yeah so I&#39;ll be like I&#39;ll say
something everybody what you&#39;re like
yeah and it&#39;s just like how
I don&#39;t know but I just really hope that
me speaking to you about stereotypes
will have you guys change your mind sets
about how you view people and expect
them to be a certain way just be you
guys thank you very much
[Music]
you
