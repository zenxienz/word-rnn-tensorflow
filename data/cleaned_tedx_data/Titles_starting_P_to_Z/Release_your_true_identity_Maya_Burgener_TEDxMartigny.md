let me start with a question who are you
I mean really suppose I ask you
personally what will you respond I&#39;m a
lawyer I&#39;m AB psychologist perhaps I&#39;m a
mom or I&#39;m a student often times that&#39;s
how we define us in Western culture in
Africa that respond
I&#39;m from the type of afar or Mahara and
by the way valise ons are pretty similar
to Africans I can&#39;t remember how many
times I get asked de Lafitte a key fob
along bitch whose daughter are you
we also think in some sort of tribal
terms and while it&#39;s partially true that
our inheritance our relationships and
our profession defines us it&#39;s not what
I&#39;m looking for today I want to go
deeper to the core of you and me I&#39;m
going to talk about identity and freedom
you need to be free from twisted
mindsets and defining circumstances in
order to become the best version of
yourself I myself I got a second chance
to find freedom by releasing my true
identity perhaps this is one for you too
so Who am I in a typical introduction
I&#39;d say something like this I&#39;m a TV
producer and host primary at canallers
for I&#39;ve been given the privilege to run
my own show which is called visual and
the visual is a miracle in itself I&#39;ve
started with nothing but a vision and
then a blueprint and this was my only
physical object in a in order to acquire
a huge amount of money by several
sponsors in the middle of summer
break-ins less than seven weeks as a
basic financial security in order to
start production I didn&#39;t have a video
no financial experience nothing but a
burning desire to produce a show where
we go beneath the usual TV talk to the
heart of human being and it worked well
and I want to say thank you to Canada
for this opportunity it worked and I
love it because people are in the center
people are my passion and therefore next
to TV I&#39;m working as a
and business coach I love to travel and
surf the ocean so is this Who I am I
think it reveals a whole lot about my
personality about my talents and about
my skills let&#39;s suppose I&#39;m losing my
job in TV all of a sudden I detect that
I&#39;m suffering from a life-threatening
bizarre sickness I can&#39;t do sports
anymore neither work as a coach instead
lying in hospital at the edge of life
itself what would I tell you then the
truth is I&#39;ve been there thankfully it
didn&#39;t occur all at the same time but
I&#39;ve been going through these
experiences and I&#39;m sure many of you too
you&#39;ve been going through some tough
seasons and they are not fun but there
is sensor if you allow it they strip
away from you many shallow layers of
so-called identity the process
self-releasing you to identity is an
accomplished though after one of those
seasons it&#39;s a lifelong journey and
tonight I want to share some revelations
I&#39;ve been entrusted with along this path
up until now and I&#39;d like to hand you
some tools tools to set you free from
twisted mindsets and defining
circumstances so you can receive those
revelations and those tools I&#39;ve been
discovering and applying my personal
life and after great results I&#39;ve been
testing them in the life of others daily
at work
as I&#39;ve mentioned people are in the
center of my career so those tools have
been confirmed by numerous people I
interviewed as a journalist as well as
been approved by many individuals I&#39;ve
been supporting as a life coach I could
tell you story after story but I&#39;ve
decided tonight I&#39;d like to illustrate
those tools upon my personal life
experience
the first tool I&#39;m handing you is a key
a key to release this revelation you&#39;ve
started with a yes if you&#39;re gonna take
anything out of this talk get these
certainty you can forget everything else
but keep this one you&#39;ve stored it with
a yes someone or something else above
your power said yes to you
you are a consequence of this powerful
act perhaps the most ideal scenario is
you mom and dad being crazy in love they
forget everything around them there is
so in love they become one in body soul
and spirit and by this unifying act we
call sex you are created
what an amazing perfect story of you
your roots are loved
to its core but maybe you&#39;re not as
lucky having such a perfect sort maybe
you&#39;re a so-called accident your mom or
dad didn&#39;t plan you let me tell you what
it doesn&#39;t matter there is still a big
yes behind you there is something
outside your power something that
existed before you came into being if it
wasn&#39;t your mom and dad it might have
been that if it wasn&#39;t God it was nature
itself maybe it was a single sperm which
wanted to survive to connect to create
life it was a yes outside your power
something that is bigger than you and
let me add something here this yes
wasn&#39;t there because you were
accomplishing something this yes is
unconditional in the core of your being
you designed for unconditional love and
life itself has given us this backup
long before our brain was a highly
developed to argue the opposite and if
you want this certainty planted in the
core of your being we need a key a
particular one it&#39;s the key of receiving
there is nothing you can do but receive
this unconditional yes
the change mindsets and attitudes which
are withholding you from this yes are
called striving earning performing but
also
ignorance and pride
the only way to free yourself is to get
a childlike attitude and receive this
unconditional yes acknowledge it and say
thank you it is then when you start to
taste freedom freedom from constantly
seeking validation and approval by other
people who among you knows that all of
us want to be loved and accepted we need
each other
we designed to connect but unfortunately
unhealthy patterns and twisted mindsets
have created a society where we have
become slaves of each other or precisely
speaking slaves of expectations you can
be enslaved to your own expectations
those you think others might have
oftentimes it&#39;s just a false
representation you know when I was
preparing this speech I thought you want
to give me the scientific wonderful
speech and it just didn&#39;t work
it didn&#39;t work I was having an
expectation on myself I thought you had
you probably never had but you can also
be enslaved to expectations others truly
do have either way we&#39;re like puppets
hanging on strings attached to
expectations and whatever others say or
think of us influences how we move some
of us more some of stress but all of us
too and don&#39;t underestimate the power of
this pattern it&#39;s deep why because we
were born into a system where acceptance
is based on a condition I assume when
you were a baby like people were all
nice to you and loving it didn&#39;t matter
whether you would cry like you die any
moment or smile like the cutest thing on
earth if you know Richards feeling nice
it happened to me but then he changed
the older I got the more I learned that
my behavior was influencing people&#39;s
approval teachers were liking me based
on my grades boys and my look and
friends on my outgoing personality and
some birthday parties this pattern is
deep and as I&#39;ve said we need each other
but there is a difference between
operating as a slave or govern as a free
human being and if you know deep down
your heart that there is a big
unconditional yes you don&#39;t need to
squeeze this desperately out of other
people in contrary if you know that you
can easily cut some strings of
expectations you own those you think
others might have or those others truly
do have you ready to handle the next
tool the scissor of bravery cutting
strings requires courage you&#39;re brave
moving that direction because you don&#39;t
know the outcome
let me exhibit this device by another
example of my personal life as a young
adult I was hearing a lot you&#39;re always
in a good mood you&#39;re always happy it&#39;s
so fun to be around you well in reality
I wasn&#39;t feeling happy all the time I
was having some bad days too
but somehow unconsciously I&#39;ve picked up
that I am loved because I&#39;m always happy
conditional love and this was just
influencing my life over and over again
probably that wasn&#39;t the case a typical
false presumption but it was my
interpretation of their words hence I
never told anyone that I was having a
bad day or painful heartache and by
acting so I was cutting off parts of
myself I was rejecting pain and this
inward behavior was manifesting itself
in a physical condition called anorexia
thankfully only for a short period of
time but I&#39;ve basically stopped eating
and this was a physical manifestation of
my inner rejection towards myself being
the bad mood having a pre day being a
mess and the only way out of this was
freeing myself from a string called your
loft because you&#39;re always happy
conditional laughs and here he comes
the Caesar of bravery and as I&#39;ve said
cutting strings requires courage but who
of you knows that amazing quote once you
become fearless life becomes lemon
so I had to be brave and practiced the
exact thing I was most afraid of and
actually storied practicing being in a
bad mood and surprisingly I was I&#39;ve
stopped putting on the mask of glorious
happiness some days where I felt sad or
discouraged and surprisingly people
loved me anyway and they do you can try
it and most important one of these
people is myself if you want to free
yourself from strings of expectations
you need to do the exact thing you&#39;re
most afraid of maybe you&#39;re afraid of
saying no you&#39;re feeling insights to
other people because you&#39;re having
difficulties to say no be brave say no
you&#39;ll figure people like you anyway and
if not your affection isn&#39;t real they&#39;re
not worth it period what we truly need
are the yeses of people who are able to
handle our nose that&#39;s what we need we
need connection we can&#39;t walk alone but
unconditional one and it leads me to my
last revelation circumstance don&#39;t
define your value the B - such a
powerful symbol for you and me is the
last tool I&#39;m handing you four years ago
I was unemployed never ever in my whole
life I imagined this could happen to me
you know things worked mostly pretty
well my career even in school my grades
were usually ace later on I got accepted
into acting school first casting I slept
very easily into journalism but this
situation it was different it was quite
a shock
and in addition pretty much all of my
clothes and your friends were getting
married and moved out of town I was
alone and didn&#39;t have a job I felt very
incomplete ashamed and lonely I was
absolutely devastated and I remember so
clearly the low point after three months
not finding a job I got recruited into a
working program by the unemployment
office it was a program mostly for
people are not very motivated so me
being there I was very under exerted I
was bored and felt so misplaced this
situation and it was at that time that
I&#39;ve been receiving a precious tool a
tool to remember a fundamental truth it
was handed to me by a former coworker
I randomly met for coffee one day I told
him I was just being real and I told him
you know I really really feel ashamed
not to have a job and being stuck in
that program he was listening looked at
me and said you&#39;re a jewel and no
circumstance that ever change your value
and this one sentence shifted everything
it was reminding me on my true value a
Bijou a jewel is such a powerful symbol
of your worth who of you knows that
whether this jewel is all shiny
presented in a jewelry store or hidden
in a dark garage its value doesn&#39;t
change if it&#39;s worth is a ten thousand
Swiss friends in the jewelry store it&#39;s
not going to reverse if you hide it in
your dirty dark garage circumstance
don&#39;t define your value your worth stays
the same and did you also know that in
order for a uncut rough gemstone to
become the shiny Bijou a craftsman has
to cut away a minimum of 50% last winter
I&#39;ve visited Sri Lanka the island of
jewels
I&#39;ve watched those craftsmen as they
have been polishing and quenching those
gemstones it&#39;s a fact the TAF of a gem
is cut away in order to shine at its
best I think in difficult seasons it
helps us to remember that we only become
the most splendid and magnificent
version of ourselves once we surrender
to the cutting process and today I can
say with all of my heart that I love my
job it&#39;s so crucial and I&#39;m so grateful
for my friends
and sandy thank you here you mean a lot
to me but I&#39;m not rooted there it may
all say Dawei and there is still a big
big unconditional yes behind me the key
of receiving made it possible that his
certainty is rooted in my heart but
there are times I&#39;m forgetting about
this unconditional love just somehow it
slipped into the background and
unconsciously and trying to get this
information out of other people or
myself and I&#39;m strict again but by now
I&#39;ve got another tool the scissor of
bravery I can free myself by practicing
it the exact thing I&#39;m most afraid of
and you&#39;ll remain free in all seasons if
you keep the vision in your pocket
circumstance don&#39;t define your value
your worth stays the same you&#39;re a
miracle act like one
[Applause]
you
