I&#39;d like to share with you a personal
story and it starts when I was very
young when I saw a movie called The Time
Machine based on in the HG Wells novel
at the end of a movie the main character
George decides to leave his aristocratic
life and travel through time and he
takes with him
some articles from his library his best
friend David comes in and he sees the
maid telling him four books are missing
from the library and she asked Dave I&#39;m
wondering what books that mr. George
take with him in a typical Hollywood
fashion David looks at the camera and
says the real question would be what
four books would you take now as a child
I saw the movie I said why would he take
books of course my mind was in a
different place at that time
and I think at least according to my
mother probably still isn&#39;t the same
place my first thought was like I will
not take books I will take with me the
three things or four of the three things
that are more important in my creative
work Toys Toys Toys
so I&#39;d like to share with you some of
them which I have right here this would
be the box that will come with me in
this journey through time this would be
the toys that I would take with me and
the first one is a Rubik&#39;s Cube
I grew up trying to solve the Rubik&#39;s
Cube and actually I learn a lot of
things from the Rubik&#39;s Cube and the
first thing I&#39;d like to say and brag
about I&#39;m an architect and I teach
architecture at Clemson University
and the Rubik&#39;s Cube was invented by a
colleague of mine amazing right
I just don&#39;t know him he happens to be
an architecture professor so I think
there&#39;s still hope for me to make
something that will change the world the
Rubik&#39;s Cube taught me incredible things
but the first one that I learned from
this little contraption is I learned
patience and I lose perseverance you see
it took me 14 years to solve the Rubik&#39;s
Cube for the first time 14 years in the
making I remember sometimes going
through my drawer looking for things and
there was the cube looking at me so are
you gonna try or you&#39;re gonna give up
I&#39;m glad I never gave up because he
taught me the power of persistence but I
also learned a few things from the
Rubik&#39;s Cube when you are solving the
rubik&#39;s cube sometimes you have to
scramble things that you had already
built so sometimes you have to trace
your steps back
I also learned from a mistake so
sometimes I made a mistake in the cube
and I said well I&#39;ll try it again
I also learned that sometimes you have
to scramble things to build them back
again and that you have to trust that
you can do it the second toy that will
come with me
in this amazing journey would be a chess
set
chess this incredible toy that have
endured history and there&#39;s so many ways
to play it my mom taught me how to play
chess when I was very very young and I
used to play with my best friend but
there were times where we&#39;ll get a
little bit bored about playing chess and
we said why don&#39;t we spice up the rules
a little bit I learned from chess that
you can follow the rules and have a
great time but if you change the rules
some things be spiced up
so for example we used to say well if I
capture two of your pieces I can crown
upon so somebody I have two queens so
the game changed a lot every time I
captured a piece because he was in full
defensive mode and I wanted to capture
another one I learned that when you
change up things just a little enough
great things can happen
the ultimate goal was to have fun and he
and I did have fun for many many days
and years
another toy that would come with me
would be a paper but not any kind of
paper yes this is origami paper the
beauty about origami is that allow me to
make any toy that I want and I&#39;m only
bounded by my imagination so I can make
things like the most beautiful and
natural creatures or the most
imaginative forms what I learned from
origami was or at least this little
paper was you don&#39;t add anything you
don&#39;t take away anything everything that
you need is there and it&#39;s only your
imagination that is the limits to the
things that you can do but there&#39;s a
little paper
the last toy that would probably come
with me in this journey well I can&#39;t not
go on a journey time without my lego
sets I mean there&#39;s no way they&#39;re
staying behind I learn incredible things
from playing Legos growing up and every
time every year that I got one of my
students who said I became interested in
architecture because I used to play with
Legos when I was a challenge said I did
too sadly the same thing Lego stopped me
incredible things it taught me that well
you follow instructions you get
beautiful things in the box but also you
get amazing things when you make it
you&#39;re on
I learned beautiful things with Legos as
well I learned to share because my best
friend and I used to get LEGO sets and
then we&#39;ll pull them together in a box
and then we&#39;ll build new things we would
negotiate pieces I&#39;d say well you give
me this one I&#39;ll give you three of these
we used to build race cars and then race
them down a board on the stairs and see
who would be the strongest one who would
go first and if you lost the race you
had the chance to build it again so
incredible things about sharing and
bonding I learned from playing with
Legos Legos actually followed me through
time until I became an adult although
I&#39;m not sure about that I&#39;m still an
adult yet I came across an interesting
paper that discussed about how many
different ways can you combine LEGO
pieces this is a result of a story when
the son of the founder of Lego went to
file for a patent and the Patent Office
er how many different ways can you
combine six of these blocks the four by
two block well it took them some time to
come up with the answer that is a little
bit over 102 million different ways that
six pieces can be combined what&#39;s
interesting is that in 2002 a group of
mathematicians from the University of
Copenhagen revisited this problem and
found out that the real number is more
like 915 million and some change very
large number
so I took upon to see well what can I do
with these things
and the first thing we said well how
many different ways can two of these be
combined so these are 24 of the initial
ways that two toys two legal set pieces
can be combined my students were working
on this it turns out that if you ignore
symmetry that number goes up to 46 and
if one of these blocks is actually a
different color the number doubles so it
became really interesting as an
architect to find out how many different
ways can a good idea be put into
practice I use Legos in my classes so
I&#39;m still playing with them I have a
class that&#39;s called creative play with
Lego and people say what do you do with
it well we come and play with Legos and
then we discuss things about creativity
and more important we have fun a couple
weeks ago I had a student visiting our
school and then he came to my class he
said I can&#39;t believe you play Lego in
college said well not only that you get
credit for that so the things that I do
with Lego in my classes go from studying
architecture looking up models of famous
architects in this case American
architect Richard Meier we look at
elements of scale and proportion we
study formal composition we study
different ways that a same set of rules
can produce a new design we starting
classical architecture as well and this
is a new design from a Palladian villas
from architect from Renaissance and era
Palladio we follow the rules and created
a new design students learn a lot about
that and we look at the details but more
important we have fun and we learn you
see I believe toys are not only trinkets
for
kate&#39;s but a fundamental for the
development in our society I cannot
conceive a war without toys and that&#39;s
why everywhere where I go in time a box
like this will accompany me the toys
that would allow me to learn and to
share experiences from my life now just
like in the movie I share with you the
four toys that would come with me in
this journey what I like to challenge
you is to look for what are the toys
that are going to ignite your passion
and shake things up
