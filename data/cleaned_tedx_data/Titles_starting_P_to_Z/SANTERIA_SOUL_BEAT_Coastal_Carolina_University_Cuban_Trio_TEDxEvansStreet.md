aresia religion was brought to the New
World by Yoruba slaves various
traditions based on the Yoruba system of
beliefs can be found in Latin America
the Caribbean and the United States even
in Cuba there&#39;s a variety of different
practices so the religion is better
thought of as an interrelated system of
beliefs rather than a unified whole but
it&#39;s important to note that no matter
how diverse the details the larger
principles are consistent and
universally understood Santeria is the
popular name of this religion in Cuba
but its proper name is Regla de OCHA
which means rule of the orishas for
practitioners orishas are humanity&#39;s
connection to the spiritual world today
we will be performing tutto case or
rhythms for allah gua a leg why is the
god of destiny he is the guardian of
spiritual pathways and he is always the
first to be performed for in ceremony
because he is the opener and closer of
doors to the spiritual world
