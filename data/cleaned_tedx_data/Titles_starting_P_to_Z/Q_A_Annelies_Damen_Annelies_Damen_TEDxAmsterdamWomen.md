yes on the lease welcome thank you we
met a few weeks ago or months
I think months ago yes my first question
is because I researched and read some
stuff about you that you completely
changed your career and started with
photography why well I I really see
myself now as a photographer it enables
me to combine my creativity with
traveling around worlds my other big
passion and it&#39;s my second life&#39;s like
my second career I was born in an
entrepreneurial family and when after
high school I studied at nail or a
business or something totally different
and in my early 30s I started at the
academy for photography and after that I
became photographer yes my second
question is I saw a few of your pictures
I loved the pictures of the stories of
your grandmother here and the pictures
when you travel to Africa and if it&#39;s
a-- what motivates you to take these
pictures well I think it comes from
within it&#39;s really freedom of freedom in
my mind I never thought I was a creative
person when I was growing up but I
travelled when I was 29 for one year
through Africa I started in Morocco all
the way down to Cape Town and I think
when you do something like that after
around five months you you you let go of
your patterns you let go of your life
you know that&#39;s been comfortable to you
I slept in a tent for six months
traveling and then I thought what do I
want in life I don&#39;t want to sit in an
office anymore never again I don&#39;t want
to have a boss anymore and I was an
amateur photographer and all these
beautiful African women came in front of
my lens and I thought you know I admire
them there
beautiful they&#39;re proud they&#39;re
independent and I love taking the photos
I would love to become a photographer
not knowing exactly how but it&#39;s that&#39;s
gave me the had a push to a couple of
years later to start the academy for
photography yeah so my last question is
you have an exhibition when you go
outside I think to the right maybe you
want to share something about that then
during the break you will see that you
can watch and talk to Annalise about her
beautiful pictures and also maybe about
her journey yes absolutely the photos or
the subjective of my photography is
always about women it&#39;s can be female
forms connecting to nature connecting
women connecting to their surroundings
the exhibition is outside it&#39;s it&#39;s all
right when you walk out of here I&#39;m
showing 10 big art photos from five
different series I&#39;ve been making them
throughout the last five years they&#39;re
very different some of them are nude
it&#39;s really about form some of them are
really a story like my Indonesian
grandmother she had to leave like many
other Dutch people living in Indonesia
after World War Two and I loved her
story and I wanted to do something with
my photography when she passed away so I
followed her trail in Indonesia and I
can tell you a bit more about it I have
a catalog and some photos out there so
it&#39;s really about the women I admire
women when I meet a woman on my travels
who really makes a difference I think it
is in many parts of the world so much
harder for a woman to make a difference
there for a man and that&#39;s why they keep
on inspiring me and I keep on
photographing them thank you Emily
