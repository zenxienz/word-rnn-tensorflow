for nearly 24 years now fifty years when
the genocide happened for those who
survived for us it was really it was
terrible it was total loss you found
yourself suddenly for those who remember
it was on Easter short after Easter so
Easter where or in the church were
celebrating we&#39;re with the families and
we didn&#39;t know that this was the last
time we were seeing each other
later when the genocide was over three
months only 100 days you find yourself
okay still alive but are you alive are
you alive when your your people
everybody is dead you have no husband
anymore you have no father no mother
many of my friends have no children at
all I&#39;m really happy and I think this is
what saved me that for me it was really
a miracle my children survived and I&#39;m
happy you said that a man dies tonight
in the room she was only six months I
was always having her on my back always
afraid that she can fall down and yeah
but she survived and actually have to
say it today is her birthday when I
wonder
so you&#39;re only to say you find yourself
you have nobody anymore and you have to
continue to leave
we were not shouting saying okay great
we survived we were really thinking we
were condemned to live and this is what
many many of the survivors many of the
women especially the women were saying
like the women you saw in the film
sometimes they say they didn&#39;t kill you
the young girl or Jenny she asked the
rapist the one who raping her he asked
them kill me and the man told her and he
laughed his head I&#39;m not killing you the
deaf I&#39;m giving you is worth and the
younger she didn&#39;t know anything about
sex she didn&#39;t know anything about she
was raped you know about AIDS but the
man knew that he was sick and he knew
that he isn&#39;t his infecting hash is
going to die slowly and this was really
what was going to happen if we were not
really lucky to come together later but
not only you lose your people but I
think what was also terrible is that you
lose you lose the trust in the human
beings the people who killed our people
they were our neighbors they were our
teachers they were our doctors they were
our priests they were our colleagues in
their jobs so they were normal people
like you and me so don&#39;t think that the
killers are special terrible people
savages this is not true they are like
you and me so when you survive and you
know who did it and you have to continue
to live again
it is really terrible to go ahead but
not only our neighbors who killed us but
what about this famous international
community what happened in Rwanda was
known it was not and prepared the UN was
there the soldiers were there they were
prepared to do something but when it
started they left so it depends in which
place is happening it was happening in
the wrong place we were not interesting
I like to say if what happened to the
Tutsi in one day 94 can happend to the
guerillas because we have the best
guerillas in the mountains I hate them
no I don&#39;t hate them now that I think no
I don&#39;t hate them they are innocent they
have nothing to do with that but if what
happened to the two T&#39;s in 94 had
happened to the guerrillas I&#39;m sure that
the world has done it should have done
something and for us they didn&#39;t do
anything
I remember I was baking the the French
and the the Belgian when they came to
evacuate all the foreigners people who
have a country who who does we&#39;re a
human being doesn&#39;t mean it was
something when they come to evacuate
them I bet them to take my children
because my friend in Belgium was ready
to take them they refused they didn&#39;t
take them and they took they cut and
they dogs I&#39;m going to say that I hate
cats and dogs I&#39;m not really very
friendly with but it is not my fault I
was in a place where they were more
valuable than human beings then you can
understand that I&#39;m not so so to speak
so when they refused to take my children
but they took the cats and the dogs
because they were French because they
were Belgium so I lost we lost also this
trust in the humanity there&#39;s a word
humanity it didn&#39;t mean anything
didn&#39;t didn&#39;t work in that time so just
to let you know that the loss was so
total everything was destroyed of course
the houses were destroyed everything was
looted we didn&#39;t have anything at all
but I think what was really terrible is
to see a society which is also lost all
the values were also lost I remember
something which really struck me after
the genocide the very banal usual
greetings how we get in our country when
you meet somebody it is the custom is
that the old one has to embrace the
young one and you have to make a wish
and these wishes which which are really
nice for young girls for people to be
engaged to be married
we wish husband Daruma God
this time before you say to somebody
even Mogambo you just wonder she&#39;s
widowed so I&#39;m not going to wish her a
husband if you see children you wish
them parents garrison and Yoko I wish
you father and mother many of the
children they were orphaned you can&#39;t
wish them father and mother or you have
to think twice does he does few does he
have a parent this you can&#39;t say or to
the children we wish father and mother
garrison and Yoko I wish you parents but
they don&#39;t have parents so I don&#39;t wish
that I wish you children dear a banana
but many have laughter children or what
we wish also which is very one and we
wish cows because cows are very
important
a musher I wish you a lot of cows but
our accounts have in also killed and
eaten so I can&#39;t wish you comes you
don&#39;t have any more cards if you come to
the Christianity and everything we we
are saying yes aku&#39;s way Jesus be
glorified but for the in that time many
people have been killed in two churches
so the church and Jesus and we used to
say Jesus himself he went he left us so
I can&#39;t even tell you that so just think
that you are in presence of a society
where even the very basic greetings very
banner greetings and not sponsor you
can&#39;t say espalier like that without
thinking without thinking me twice but
fortunately the rebel army won the war
it was topped in July then we could say
peace security slowly slowly come back
and slowly slowly even though we were
thinking we are condemned to live when
you are alone you are lost but when you
are together you can do something this
is how like having said like the three
women the three friends at the beginning
then five then six then ten we start
coming together we didn&#39;t know at the
time that we are traumatized we thought
that we are crazy something was wrong
there was well known
the woman who used to be we were we were
forgetting everything no concentration
all the symptoms of trauma you were
cooking if you are lucky to have some
food you cook and you put salt three
times without knowing you go outside you
you used to dress properly you are very
nice and you when you dress you go
outside and find out that you have put
it upside down and you have and you are
ashamed and you hide it and you become
to be very aggressive and things like
that so but because we come together and
we start talking and when one is talking
you see what you have been saying
anything okay I&#39;m not the only one crazy
so we&#39;re so many crazy and we come
together and fortunately we come to know
that we are not so crazy that what
happened to us was crazy so well okay
let us not only be condemned to live but
actually let us choose to live and then
slowly slowly we discovered this
strength of being together
but not only being together as as as the
same women but we also really
experienced the good feeling of seeing
people who are in solidarity with
yourself this is how we came to meet a
Kevin comic relief we came to meet staff
survivor
charity here in London survivor fund we
came to meet people who were really
interested in us and we were looking at
us as human beings when we have been
really less than human beings in the
past so slowly slowly we started really
to challenge and we started to do I
remember we are doing everything and the
people giving money they don&#39;t like
people who are doing everything they
want you to do something so when one
Chaput so when we started with comic
relief they were very happy because we
are very strong with income generating
project it was working it was working
and then one day they come wanting to
film again a very successful story and I
was really mad because I remember
everything he was dying women
because after few years we started to
realize that the majority of us the
majority of the survivors have been
raped have been affected with it and
they are dying so this is when we
challenged comic relief and serve we
said if you want to film a success story
and not and not grace then you have to
invest now in this program of
antiretroviral it was not easy but we
are really lucky they agreed they they
took what had the needs of the people
and not their own agenda so they have an
agenda we said sorry your agenda is good
but there is more money there&#39;s a
chamber okay we did both so we continued
doing
click continue during income-generating
project and tis true we needed income
generating project we needed housing we
needed all the project in health in this
but we needed real is very very urgently
this at retroviral and as you have seen
in the film really the women it is a
rebirth it is a new life because we have
find solidarity with other people who
believed in us and I want to too to make
a conclusion and I think really this is
what I like to share and this is what we
have as as a gift for you people who
have been with us all along because I
think it worked for us but it can work
for you too so I&#39;m coming back to the
house again
so when you when the cows in the morning
when they go out of the out of the fence
out of the horse they go - outside - how
do you say it in English - yeah sorry
yeah when they go to grazing then you
take them out and we have to clean the
place so we take the manual and there is
a place behind the fence where we put
the manure but I think that it is the
same with the farmers here this place
where you put the manual manure ant is
really it is really smelling it is not
the best place you will go to have a
chat with somebody
but what is the the true reality of this
corner where you put all this manua at
least in our place and I think it&#39;s we
work also here why not
so the place where it is smelling so bad
the place where this manure is the place
where people are not going to come to
chant but this is the best place where
you plant your banana tree or your
pumpkin and you you you will really
harvest the best of it
so we said women if we want to continue
to go ahead let us use our smelling
story let us use our I was suffering so
the other message I just wanted to say
to make I don&#39;t wish anybody to suffer
in order to grow but when you suffer and
use your suffering you can really
produce the best banana and the best
pumpkin and the witch
