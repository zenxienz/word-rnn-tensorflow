what are you doing for the rest of your
life for your dreams and what are your
aspirations who says that your identity
is influenced by culture art social
media or fashion who says that that is
the norm
what about what you want to do who do
you want to be what do you want to
become where do you want to go my name
is vini McCoy I spent many years in the
Army I&#39;ve been on numerous United Nation
missions I&#39;ve seen two wars in the
Middle East
I&#39;ve spent 23 years soldiering on the
Irish father true in the troubled times
I know own a successful security company
and in my spare time I help young people
to identify themselves and I put in to
them when I get out of life and I give
them advice but I wasn&#39;t always like
that and I can tell you now I didn&#39;t get
to where I was by having a piece of
paper from the education system to tell
me what I could do and what I couldn&#39;t
do I want to bring you back to nineteen
seventy five seventy six when a man
called Nelson Mandela was on his 15th
year in jail for having a vision for
having a dream it was a time that a
career guidance coach was unheard of and
if you left school early you&#39;re tagged
as a dropout you weren&#39;t normal actually
the more I think of it I try to be
normal one sanitaire was probably the
worst two minutes of my life
but you know along all that time no one
asked me why did I leave school and I&#39;m
gonna tell you now I left school because
the education system simply had not got
the same vision as I had so I left but I
want to tell you story what happened
before he left and it&#39;s true because
about me
there was a school to be a team of three
people and I was honored and the
teachers put a lot of energies into to
the speakers and it was my turn to go on
stage so I get out there and I stood on
stage in front a forty to test or level
felt like that in front of over 200
people and I stood there and I stood
there and I stood there what came over
me
I&#39;ve christened that sense called the
goldfish syndrome
I could see everything I could hear
everything it was not in common hurt so
I walked off the stage and I was greeted
with the forced heat job you&#39;re an
embarrassment that was horrible
that was a disaster I hope you got to
sweep in roads but there was this one
voice and the top beyond the shoulder
and he said young McCoy you won&#39;t feel
like it now but in time that will stand
here two teens came over me standing on
that stage and one was the isolation but
I&#39;ll never ever ever forget the fear so
what is fear fear is the take or a many
a dream and if you overcome your fear
you will get to live your dream so I
left school and I was introduced to my
second family which was the army that
wasn&#39;t taken yesterday so I joined the
army and I knew straight away it&#39;s where
I was a accomplice a map orienteering
the life and people listen to what you
say and you got to make decisions and I
just enjoyed it I just landed on my feet
two years later I found myself landing
in Peru to the Middle East on a mission
and my mornings were full of marhaba
Siddiqui he thought mop suit you learned
the local language and excuse me if
they&#39;re uneven from Arabic they&#39;re my
Arabic is not great but that&#39;s your mana
was followed out helping families
helping refugees
life was great until diety end of April
1980 when closer than you are in front
of me now I was talking to to my
comrades and a few minutes later were
shot dead the point of nowhere
a few minutes later on the checkpoint we
were missing another Irish soldier and a
car crashed into the checkpoint shots
were fired and we opened the back of the
car and there was that old soldier still
alive but badly wounded and we got a
medivac then taken away someone&#39;s past
and I found myself at home my hometown
and our D and when you&#39;ve been there you
don&#39;t go down to town straight away
because you don&#39;t mix life is very
different where you&#39;re after comin from
and when I eventually got down to town
and crossing over the bridge
I met one of my old school met to the
voice of while you drop loaded Vinnie
where have you been this 2 years and I
got talking to him and I was amazed as
his attitude he was going to college and
he proceeded to tell me dad he couldn&#39;t
understand what he was doing at school
and if he didn&#39;t get his degree he was
going to be nothing absolutely nothing
and he was convinced with the system
that was in place that if he couldn&#39;t
understand that his life was gone
he was living in this thing called dogma
you&#39;re living your life in someone
else&#39;s tinkin so I moved on there&#39;s a
great man that I call my hero in life
the man called Christie Hennessy a
brilliant musician Christie can never
read or write he could write some great
songs in his head and bring them out
different people Christie Moore merely
black all those but Christie would tell
you if he was alive today did he hear
dat&#39;s cool he asked his mother could he
leave school and you Nina told the
teacher I&#39;m leaving school and the
teacher said to him why do you know
what&#39;s going to happen out there
and Christie was about to answer and the
teacher goes nothing nothing&#39;s going to
happen you and you&#39;ll never
nothing but the annoying thing about
this was no one&#39;s seen Christie for his
creativity he was a genius a Christie
would true life without reading or
writing and he reminds me of obstacles
that&#39;s the ward comes into my mind and
the obstacles are I was sitting in
Phoenix Park one day and this blind man
passed me and I had a great view
standing right behind him and I was
rolled walks or whatever on the footpad
cobblestone door wouldn&#39;t have been
there yesterday all fresh stuff and I
watched him I mean oh and he removed
he got Brenda sneak around the pin and
he go round the seat and he could out
the far side unscathed I mean that&#39;s it
that&#39;s the answer that&#39;s the Christie
Hennessy err life is full of obstacles
and sometimes we can&#39;t see them but we
know they&#39;re there and when it&#39;s left to
our own devices we&#39;ll always find a way
to get through them it&#39;s like so much
TNT in the mirror you look in the mirror
you need to sort out person out you need
to tell that person you needed this I
don&#39;t believe in all of that you
couldn&#39;t be more wrong that person in
the mirror is you you&#39;re unique and
you&#39;re perfect it&#39;s what you don&#39;t see
it&#39;s what you need to sort out I learnt
a thing in life to listen and you can
listen the way you&#39;re let do it now you
can listen with your ears and you can
listen with your eyes it&#39;s when you
start listening with your heart and that
is to understand the person and to see
the world as their seer 2 years ago with
our school reunion 40 years and I was on
the committee and I got a great honor I
was asked to host it
and it was amazing the joke was the drop
bird got to host so the conversation
that night was unbelievable I want to
really come down to sixty percent of the
guys and girls the right school felt it
wasted three years of our life and most
of these people were running their own
businesses today the education system
just didn&#39;t help these people
Matt&#39;s to you to you and me are
different with an armory Union last year
and it&#39;s called you stand down the
colorful and that&#39;s it there I got to
walk in the front and we&#39;re all still in
step after forty years it&#39;s in Marion
Square and it was to honor her fallen
and the most amazing thing about this
was a lot of us overseas a lot of guys
couldn&#39;t read or write I used to talk to
guys who that when they came down to the
job been done we got it done
and the most amazing terrifying
unbelievable moment the guy that we
talked aware to medevac the 25 years
prior to that I sat and talked I needed
his own family Dale and I was just in
there isn&#39;t it you know a compass will
point you in the right direction but it
can&#39;t make you go there it&#39;s up to you
my goldfish now is what I&#39;m aware
I&#39;ve become that person that tapped me
on the shoulder I become that person now
and every day I give a talk have no
doubt you are looking at a person live
in their dream today today is the toward
of November 2017 on the toward November
2018 if you are the same person
then as you are now will you be happy
with your life
so I&#39;m asking you have you the story to
tell like me or are you gonna wait 40
years how can I leave you with this life
to me it&#39;s not a bit to big cars it&#39;s
not about all the land certainly not
about the money and not about how you
look it&#39;s all about the person you
become
