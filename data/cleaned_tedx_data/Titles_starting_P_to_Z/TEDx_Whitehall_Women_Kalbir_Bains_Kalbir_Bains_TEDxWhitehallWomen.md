hi everyone into my talk they take us
places we want to go and sometimes
places we don&#39;t they form an integrity
part of our lives and environment and
represent a clear link between our past
present and future however one thing
that we can all agree on is that they
connect cities and people from different
backgrounds together
one could say bridges are a key
diversity and inclusion some people burn
them while others build them I sit
firmly on the latter clamp I can answer
that in one simple word passion so what
is my passion well I&#39;m going to talk you
through take you through my personal
journey and show you how I&#39;m trying to
move the dialogue in a positive manner
by building sorry by bridging the
generation gap in the South Asian
community six years ago I embarked on a
journey to writing about mine and my
mother&#39;s real-life experience of dealing
with trials and tribulations of having
an arranged marriage through two
becoming divorces in the Punjabi
community this in itself was a huge
challenge due to the nature of what I
was going to cover but another challenge
was that I also suffer from dyslexia and
at the age of 22 I was diagnosed with
the reading capability of a
seven-year-old and at the age of 29
I gained a C grade GCSE English to show
my then matrimony family that I could
achieve this as they always put my
confidence down reminding me of my
dyslexia I&#39;m proud to be standing up
here today speaking out TEDx experience
sorry TEDx talk and I hope that this
inspires other women do not let anyone
ever tell you that you cannot follow
your dreams and keep focused and believe
in yourself build bridges with people
who have a positive vibe and believe in
you I want to read a few lines from my
own life experience and hope you
understand and picture what life was
like
and why I&#39;m so passionate about
encouraging you all to carry on building
bridges both inside and outside of your
representative communities gender
equality after my younger sister was
born three years later no one from my
father&#39;s side of the family of the man
Orinda aunty came to visit us when my
brother was born there wasn&#39;t even
enough space in the maternity ward
domestic violence as a child I used to
count each step up and down 13 mother
hit every single one of them I never
counted the steps again alcohol abuse
there was no way we could contain the
rage of this man this stranger our
father we were left holding the Tata of
his sweater
leaded shirt which wreaked of Bacardi
arranged marriage
first comes arranged marriage then comes
love my parents had an arranged marriage
as did my grandparents and
great-grandparents it&#39;s part of parcel
of life in my culture dairy abuse the
modern-day dairy lovers I thought the
tradition of dairy had gone out the
window but not in this family&#39;s case
they wanted to squeeze as much as they
could out of my mother and having almost
double the size of the wedding and
having the nerve to ask for gold
abortion someone I loved was never born
abortion hurts like emotionally like how
counselors and therapies don&#39;t work if
you regret it you will always regret it
I openly discuss issues surrounding
honour based violence the difference
between forced marriage arranged
marriage dairy abuse domestic violence
abortion and gender equality in a
community which typically chooses to
remain silent on many of these important
topics by writing in such a can dish and
open manner about the hardship that I
have been through my writing can
hopefully build bridges with the younger
and
older generation so that we come so that
we can both understand the Harshit that
they&#39;ve all faced with that build a more
tolerant and understanding community I
hope to inspire more women to speak out
about sensitive topics and to be more
open about situation which they have
been traditionally topic being taught to
keep quiet by speaking at this event at
TEDx talk I hope that this goes towards
building bridges within different
generation of women and men regardless
of their culture color or background who
have kept silent and not talked about
real issues that go on behind closed
doors it brings a tear to my eye when I
think about women that I&#39;ve met that I
have met in situations that are not as
fortunate as me I wonder why they do not
have the courage to speak up and have a
voice and Here I am breaking molds I
also think about why some parents in the
South Asian community view their
daughters as burden one of the reasons I
feel is that that so many traditions
that practice in many cultures around
the world have sex is embedded in them
and if we don&#39;t make a chatter stand
against this now it will never change
future generation will continue to
suffer so here&#39;s a call of action I&#39;d
like you all to pledge how you&#39;re going
to build bridges within your own
communities I shall leave you with a
saying for my first Sikh Guru Guru Nanak
Dev ji okay very good Yuka Khalsa by
guru ji ki Fateh there from a woman a
man is born within a woman a man is
conceived to a woman he is engaged and
married within a woman his friend sorry
a woman becomes his friend through a
woman the future generation comes so
when his woman dies he seeks another
woman to a woman he is bounced so why
call her bad from her Kings are born
from a woman a woman is born without a
woman there would be no one at all Guru
Nanak there
raagh sama halal one paid 473 of the
good Bonnie thank you
[Applause]
