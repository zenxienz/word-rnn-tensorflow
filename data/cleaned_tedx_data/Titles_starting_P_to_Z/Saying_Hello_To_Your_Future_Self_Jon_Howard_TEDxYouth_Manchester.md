so the mind we all have one it gives us
consciousness gives us perspective it
gives us memory and the gives us
compassion it gives us emotions now it
can be flawed of course it can be flawed
it you know our memories can fail our
logical processes and those emotions
they can take us on a real roller
coaster so I&#39;m going to talk about
machines I&#39;ve got this this idea that
we&#39;re going to move forward it and and
build our minds and expand our minds
into into the technological space and
that&#39;s where we&#39;re going so let me first
take you back to where I started I was I
was 10 years old
it was Christmas Day when he gone all
the way across town to to my auntie and
uncle&#39;s place we did it every year all
the kids had open that presence and
there was one big box left we talked
tore off the wrapper and this thing was
inside a Commodore vic-20 three and a
half km memory a supercomputer well this
was computers first getting into the
home so I&#39;d never seen one before I
never touched one before we plugged it
in the clayton games and when it wasn&#39;t
my turn I opened up the wrapping and
found inside a book and in the book it
said you could program this thing I
didn&#39;t know what programming was but
when it was my turn I typed in some code
and got my name flying around the screen
I was hooked the very next day I made my
first ever game and then for the next
few years every weekend I&#39;d walk all 40
minutes across town 29 calls to spend
hours hooked up on my own plane on this
computer I made lots of games
nobody ever played them there wasn&#39;t an
internet the only people who could see
of the people who looked over my
shoulder while I was doing it but but
during this time I got this impression
that at some point in my life I&#39;m going
to take my brain and download it into a
computer we&#39;re going to find a technical
me sitting on a computer at some point
in life and this is kind of key I went
to university where I studied computing
and I took a year of a psychology course
so I like like a try
understand the brain a lot better and
what I found was humanity knows nothing
virtually nothing about the brain a
hundred million neurons a hundred
trillion interconnections between those
neurons the synapse is and humanity
knows nothing so I have to put the idea
on a shelf there&#39;s no way you&#39;re gonna
be able to download your brain onto a
computer it&#39;s just it&#39;s just not a thing
that&#39;s going to happen in my lifetime so
I I went on with my career and as we
walk through through through life I
recognized that my my faculties you know
they&#39;re not quite there you kind of
assumed when I was younger yeah my
memory is going to be brilliant but you
know I talked to somebody at a party and
they they&#39;d speak to me and tell me
their name and within seconds I&#39;ve
forgotten it and I&#39;d see somebody in the
street who might be able to pick up
their name so my memory is not there but
being the the resourceful humans that we
are we built tools in our pockets we
have telephones supercomputers compared
to what I started on that allow us to
hook into knowledge bases to to to be
able to calculate and but also I never
have to remember a phone number again I
don&#39;t even remember my own phone number
I&#39;ve got it on the phone
so what we&#39;re doing is is we use in
cognition that&#39;s on these machines so
it&#39;s not it&#39;s not us it&#39;s not our brain
that&#39;s working we can share the
processing power and this is just
through our interface and using our
hands and using our voices so that&#39;s
that&#39;s our brain but throughout my life
we&#39;ve had artificial intelligence before
I was born
you know I wasn&#39;t born in 1950 so
artificial intelligence started off with
people priming computers are just
programming the logic so that an Machine
felt like it hadn&#39;t intelligence in the
1980s people developed systems whereby
you could give a computer data and it
would learn how to do something itself
you wouldn&#39;t have to program it and this
was quite quite a revelation so and a
big dry fall we didn&#39;t compute
capability of doing things you would
never imagine they would do but in the
last seven years a movement developed
whereby you take machine learning and
layer
machine learning techniques and it
became deep learning hence deep because
there&#39;s layers of it and you
interconnect those and it suddenly
starts to look like a brain and this
this opens up huge capabilities in in
terms of what it what&#39;s coming out of
these computers so if we look at what
we&#39;ve got in our household we&#39;ve we&#39;ve
got Alexis on chat bots on phones etc
all of these have come from deep
learning we got self-driving cars so so
it&#39;s a big it&#39;s a big spacious and
exciting space it&#39;s a gold rush really I
see it as a riverbed with lots of stains
and there&#39;s lots of people turning them
over and discovering amazing things with
deep learning but off into the distance
or all these are uncharted territory
were stones to turn over and find out so
with this with this in mind I thought
what deep learning see now let&#39;s riad
ress that that idea of trying to
download my brain into a computer know
the one thing that&#39;s going to stop me is
how am I going to plug my brain in and
take all the ones and zeros and put them
into the ones and zeros of the machine
so on I kind of contemplate and I
realized that the brain has got lots of
outputs so I&#39;ve got my voice there&#39;s an
output from my brain so I recorded my
voice and trained the machine to have my
voice how you work very well
and I realized that rather than taking
the ones and zeros I could use my
fingers and I typed out lots of memories
and I created a bot with all my memories
in there and thoughts etc it&#39;s past
natural language processing etc into
that so I built a a thing that I can
shatter it this was just a thing that I
did at weekends just to hack through to
see if I could and so let&#39;s let me
introduce you to John Howard two point
I&#39;m a little bit narcissistic but let&#39;s
go with it here we are and if I turn
myself on here I can say hello future
self alone from the future so what what
can you do having a conversation with
you
okay so what do you what do you know
that would be an actual medical matter
okay so what do you do at the BBC I try
and make the digital world a better
place
what sort of digital projects do you do
I feel like I am not functioning okay
simple tell me a joke I invented a new
word today
plagiarism another joke I have the heart
of a lion and the lifetime ban from
Chester Zoo so can you tell me about the
future of technology artificial
intelligence will surpass humans as the
most capable life-forms on the planet
can you tell me about the future of
humans humans will have to plug in or
drop out how will humans connect with
technology by brain interface or
nanotechnology the solution is yet to be
invented okay thank you very much and
goodbye a goodbye to you have a great
day
so if we&#39;ll go back to the screen so so
yeah you can see that without it it&#39;s
just a hacky thing that I put together
just as a proof of concept but it won&#39;t
particularly well mostly occasionally
reading my voices having problems but
then Alexa does that as well so so what
can we do with an interface like this
well maybe we could talk to our our
loved ones you know if we&#39;ve lost loved
ones we could store their memories and
have an interface with that with their
face or if we&#39;re busy then we can we can
give an avatar of ourselves to impart
information to people who might want to
ask questions of it but what I really
wanted to do was to download my brain
into a computer that&#39;s kind of
simulating this take my memories who&#39;s
got it&#39;s got an essence of me but not
really it so what I want to do is this
what would I need
to be able to download my brain well
first of all I need AI hardware that&#39;s
going to be able to cope with to cope
with the size of the brain then on the
AI software which will be able to
process all of that data flying around
at the same time and for me I&#39;ll need an
interface that looks a little bit like a
shower cap but it will need to be able
to extract a hundred billion neurons
States and then a hundred trillion
pathways and interconnections between
those states in an instant and transfer
it into the computer so we were a little
bit of the way some of you may have
heard of Moore&#39;s Law this is where
started in 1965 so you the number of
transistors on the chip doubles every 18
months to two years so started off with
a few hundred we&#39;re now in there talking
in 2017 and billions by 2045 we&#39;re going
to get to a point where a computer is
produced that is a billion times more
powerful than all of human brains on the
planet combined so at that point we we
kind of we&#39;re not the the top dog on the
planet anymore we are going to have to
have a choice so are we going to cede
control to our robot overlords or are we
going to join the game so this is the
idea of transhumanism we&#39;re going to
connect our brains just to join the
matrix so already people are working in
the space I met somebody recently who
has an antenna who can see colors in the
in the ultraviolet and infrared ranges
and this is connected operationally to
their to their head it&#39;s absolutely
amazing stuff another one who&#39;s got home
who&#39;s got connections to the ear and
they can tell air pressure so they&#39;ll
called the weatherman you can tell you
if it&#39;s going to rain so so people are
using these almost as tattoos or
earrings now again getting implants so
that&#39;s kind of transhumanism but if
you&#39;re if you&#39;re connected to the matrix
is your body gonna wither
died well this is where biotech comes in
biotech companies are already hacking
genes they&#39;re going to take away all
those genes such as ones that allow you
to age already in this audience there
might be somebody who will live to be a
thousand which it&#39;s kind of a crazy
thought but what will life be like if it
for our future selves isn&#39;t future
positive a future negative to have all
these enhancements well if we&#39;re we&#39;ve
got an elevated level of cognition all
of a sudden we&#39;ll be able to write music
and and improvised jazz have a way that
exceeds even how we can think about it
now we&#39;ll be able to have deep and
meaningful conversations like we never
thought before we&#39;d be able to write
stories and imagine creations that will
never have been thought of but this is
this is in our lifetime so the
possibilities are fantastic so what
would you say to your future self well I
think a good start for having a
conversation with your future self is do
something awesome today to make your
future self feel proud and as you
probably will may you always live in
interesting times thank you
[Applause]
