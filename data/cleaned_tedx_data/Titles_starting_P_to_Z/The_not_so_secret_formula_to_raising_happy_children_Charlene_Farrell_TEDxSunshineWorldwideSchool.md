as parents I&#39;m sure you speak to your
children about a lot of problems
problems like friends studies school do
you want to know what I talk to your
children about when I talk to them about
all of this but I also talked to them
about drugs alcohol sex depression
sexuality and yes for some reason of
late nudies now as we sit there
discussing things one thing that stands
out is confusion why does this confusion
exist
well as adults we seem to be confused
too we live and in an age of extremism
extreme problems extreme solutions and
when there are problems with children
the fingers of doubt point to the
parents and there are extremes there as
well at one extreme we have the
overprotective parent at the other we
have the over indulgent one now the way
I look at it the solution to the problem
lies somewhere in between these extremes
however to understand the solution we do
need to take a look at the extremes so
the first type of parenting I would like
to discuss is the extreme parent now
this parent turns into the all-around
know-it-all the moment the child is born
this is the type of parent who treats
even the Communists of colds like a
villain that has to be immediately
eradicated
for us teachers this parent keeps us on
our toes why when they come for a
parent-teacher meeting we have these
one-liners that we know we cushion we
start off with your child is very
hard-working is very very intelligent
and then we try to slip in this very
subtle but these parents they catch that
word and right over there we found
ourselves an instant enemy I look at
these parents as the super spy why
because let&#39;s see it all somehow they
hear it all and they do it all leaving
nothing for their children to do now the
consequence of this type of parenting
could be either the child turns out to
be very nervous and under confident or
conversely extremely overconfident and
walks around with the sense of
entitlement that&#39;s probably because the
parent has somehow shown the child that
yes they will look after everything and
they will fight all their child&#39;s
battles do you think I&#39;m exaggerating a
few years ago this mother walks into my
office with a two-page long list of
things that her child cannot eat no not
because the child had any allergies it
is because the child might develop
allergies somewhere in the future now
the next type of parenting that I would
like to discuss is the extreme friend
for me this parent is an amazement they
are super cool they hang out with their
children they chill out with them they
allow them to explore their world with
absolutely no boundaries they actually
tell me you know I am growing with my
child I&#39;m maturing with my child I am
learning new things with my child and
all this is great really right up until
puberty and that&#39;s when everything comes
to a screeching halt that same parent
will say my child is very very spoiled I
don&#39;t know how that happened
now this parent at this stage does not
understand that this child is trying to
develop the sense of
the world they take information from the
world try to take information from what
we are giving them trying to take
information from Google and trying to
understand their own schema and this is
when the child needs a parent the most
considering all the stuff that&#39;s out
there they need to be guided and what
are these parents doing they&#39;re giving
them two extra friends it is when a
child is allowed to do what they want as
they want and how they want that I get
these ridiculous requests ma&#39;am can you
please ask my son to cut his nails he
doesn&#39;t listen to me anymore or just the
other day ma&#39;am we still my daughter to
have a shot she&#39;s not done it for some
time I had to ask this parent why why is
your daughter not shying she says
because she&#39;s always stuck with these
gadgets of hers I had to look at her
ma&#39;am this is your child and technically
those are your gadgets please go in
there and take them away I will not
judge you now with this back and forth
and these crazy requests I realized that
something had to be done but I just
didn&#39;t know what and this one day just
after this lady had left my office after
convincing me you know to tell her child
that yes he has to put his dirty laundry
in the laundry basket after school
that is when I had my Eureka moment I
jumped out of my chair ran up two
flights of stairs searching for a friend
to share mine CLE with and then I
realize I might be looking really silly
so I stopped found myself a pen and a
paper and I wrote this down now what is
this this is what I like to call my
Ferren ting formula it&#39;s nothing complex
all it means is that you raised a happy
grounded child all you need to do is be
a constant parent and be friendly with
that child in proportion to the need of
the child now before I go deeper into
this form
let me just draw your attention to the
word friendly here the friendly parent
and the extreme friend parent are two
very different things the extreme friend
as we already heard has told me that
they&#39;ve already given up their maturity
the friendly parent maintains their
maturity and the adult ideas and ideals
now as I kept looking at this formula
and trying to figure out is this one a
work something at the back of my mind
told me yes it has to work it does work
and I knew this as a fact because I had
seen this formula in play before where
had I seen it now people who know me
know I&#39;m not a parent yet but I had seen
this in my life I have two parents in
fact they&#39;re both sitting here and they
are the ones who showed me this formula
I&#39;m also pretty sure that right now they
are looking at each other thinking to
themselves oh my goodness this is the
worst possible situation for her to
completely lose it well let me jog their
memory and allow me to take you on a
little trip down my memory lane there
are these two incidences that I would
like to share
wherein I saw this formula used the
first happened when I had to choose my
subjects after the tenth grade so what
are these very friendly parents of mine
do they sack me down and they ask me
what do you want to do so I told them
and they said okay no questions no
judgement nothing and then the parent in
them kicked in they went out they got
information information on colleges fee
structures anything that I require to
understand they bought it for me
so essentially what they did was they
allowed me to choose my map but they
showed me how to use it
they guided me on how to use it now then
again when I was 14 years old they
decided that it was high time I learned
how to use my money when I was 14 so it
was technically their money what did my
very friendly
she comes to me with a brand-new shiny
ATM card I was on top the world my very
friendly father says he&#39;s gonna put
money in that account every month yay
happiest kid on the block
well then like with every parent there
was a catch in fact here there were two
the first catch was if I needed to
maintain a certain balance in that
accounts I had to complete a chores list
that they gave me and I also had to
maintain my grades and my non-academic
activities at a certain level in school
the second catch was all my expenditures
had to come out of that account so if I
had to buy stationery toiletries if I
want to buy something extravagant like a
Walkman for all those born after 2000
that is equivalent to a mp3 player but
this Walkman I had to have it so I had
to get it from that money now this
taught me a few things the first thing I
taught me was how to value my
hard-earned money the second thing he
taught me was the date trust me and that
was the most amazing feeling in the
world
then it taught me that they had my back
because any time I ran out I knew
exactly where I should go and the last
thing you taught me was when I made a
mistake
it was absolutely fine so long as I
didn&#39;t keep making the same mistakes
over and over again so there was this
one month where I ran out of money to
buy soap and it was only that one month
when I ran out of money to buy soap
so essentially what happened here was my
parents raised a happy grounded child
mean by being parents who were constant
but they were also friendly in
proportion to how much of friendliness I
needed and when now as I looked at the
way they ran the show and I looked at
the way they handled all of this I
realized that they played by certain
rules
it to be exact so I have divided these
eight rules into four rules to be to
help us be a constant parent and four
rules to help us be a friendly parent -
the first rule that will help us to be a
constant parent is lay down the law we
all have rules to govern us so why not
our kids our children need boundaries
and that is a fact communicate with your
children and this communication has to
be clear find the level of your child
and communicate with them at that level
it is essential that we open dialogue
there has to be a two-way street in days
gone by parents would talk children
would listen today children talk parents
they pretend to listen we have to make
sure that this is a balanced
communication and this is my favorite
please stop with the when I was your age
story yes a lot of agreement we&#39;ve all
heard this story yes we also told
ourselves that we wouldn&#39;t tell our
children the story but 2017 is here and
what are we doing we are telling them
the story my dear friends we have to
understand that we will never be their
age in this day and age so all those
little tidbits and jewels that we want
to throw at them is a little bit
obsolete right now now to be a friendly
parent all you need to do is listen with
your heart and listen with your head
except your children for who they are
because they are the best possible
versions of themselves we are human and
we have every right to make mistakes
when you do make a mistake and if your
child does point it out there is
absolutely no need for you to be
defensive about it this will make you
more human and in
connection with that nun to laugh at
yourself a bit because with humor comes
more humanity with that comes more
approachability so maybe somewhere in
the future your children will be talking
to you about drugs sex and rock and roll
instead of talking to me about it now
the best part about this formula is that
it can be used at any time but like
Frederick Douglass once said it is much
easier to build strong children than to
repair broken men thank you
