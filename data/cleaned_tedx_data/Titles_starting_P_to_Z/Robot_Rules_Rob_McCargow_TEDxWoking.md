I asked my young son a question what do
you want to be when you grow up and he
said daddy excitedly I want to be a
train driver or an aeroplane pilot but
how do I tell him the truth
whoever duty of care as parents to be
entirely candid and honest with our
children how do I tell him in an
artificial intelligence powered future
very essence of our jobs dignity and our
pride is at stake in fact in the next 15
years as many as 30 percent of our
existing jobs could be automated by
artificial intelligence from later
technology it was in this moment that it
dawned on me that these stories about AI
as espoused in science fiction but not
really stories at all there&#39;s certainly
not fiction and they&#39;re selling that
artificial the very real stories and if
I&#39;m serious about preparing my children
for this future that we can&#39;t exactly
foresee I need to start sharing this
story with them right now
AI could be one of the most
transformative things that will happen
to humans of all time
AI is already here more than most people
realize it powers the smartphone&#39;s in
your and the mats in your smartphone it
recommends movies you might next watch
on Netflix and increasingly in the
course of the next few years
AI will start moving from simply
assisting us to augmenting vast arrays
of our lives we&#39;ll start seeing AI
increasingly diagnosing diseases
discovering new drugs for rare diseases
it will start optimizing the energy
systems it will manage the traffic flows
in our cities it will start producing
hyper personalization of products and
services that we buy and once we&#39;ve
embraced this augmentation phase of AI
will start moving forward to this
autonomous future with self-driving cars
with supply chains that provide the
products to you before you even realize
that you need
and even the prospect of robots
intelligent robots performing surgery on
you it&#39;s quite a lot to look forward to
in the years ahead and this could lead
to substantial economic growth a recent
forecast we produced suggested that by
2030 this could add an additional 16
trillion dollars to the world economy
this is happening it&#39;s out now and in
the years ahead so we&#39;ve also got a huge
number of opportunities to solve some of
the grandest challenges in the world for
example the United Nations sustainable
development goals can you picture a
world than years ahead that&#39;s free from
poverty is free from chronic disease
you&#39;ve got a world to look forward so
potentially providing education for all
and a stable climate in a healthy
environment I think that&#39;s something we
should all aspire to deliver upon so I
advise governments and businesses on the
implications of this technology the way
they&#39;ll shed harnesses responsibly be
mindful of the implications and ensuring
we have the appropriate policies and
standards and rules in place to ensure
the benefit from this positively but I&#39;m
also a father amount I&#39;m a dad to three
young kids of eight and six and nearly
two years old and I often dwell upon the
future we&#39;re creating now that they will
inherit in the years to come it&#39;s got a
lot to think about and you keep posting
yourself this question what are you
going to be when you grow up I remember
having this conversation as a young
child with my mum and the question at
the time she posed me was answered
normally with a sensible response I
aspired to be the chairman of Ford Motor
Company
we had a clapped-out I would Ford Fiesta
so the sensible idea was to become the
chairman of Ford&#39;s so that I could buy
her a Ford Fiesta a brand-new one the
gold 1.3 liter gear for that was quite
admirable aspirations I have in actual
facts have got a confession to make my
big dream in life was to become Optimus
Prime our transformers I actually
believed there was a robot for a number
of years and maybe you might think my
presentation is still the same
and unfortunately this dream was cruelly
dashed when I went into A&amp;E for an x-ray
honor on a sprained ankle and it turned
out merely to be flesh and blood my
hopes were torn asunder I&#39;ve been
thinking quite a lot about my mum at
recent times and in fact several years
ago very sadly lost her to motor neurone
disease or or ALS cruel disease and I&#39;ve
seen also a huge number of breakthroughs
in this technology with AI the ability
to discover new drugs five times faster
than humans can do at the moment and
there&#39;s already some British companies
in fact looking at how do we solve
specifically MND I also think very much
about the question she asked me about
what I wanted to be when I grow up and
probably still trying to find that out
at the moment to be honest so I got home
from work one day asked one of these
amazing conferences discovering the
possibilities of this technology and
asked my young son Dylan what do you
want to be when you grow up and he&#39;s
answered he wants to be an airplane
pilot or a train driver without thinking
I just blurted out all those jobs
weren&#39;t exist in 20 years time and
you&#39;re looking for a job the robots will
do that
Huw huge tears hysterics he stormed off
to his bedroom
totally dejected and I spent the
remainder of the day trying to row back
my original statement but I thought I
need to have this conversation with him
and the rest of the kids so I thought I
need another go at this so where do you
go to for inspiration for your
children&#39;s upbringing well presumably
the school so the next week I said to
him go to school get a book on
technology and I scribbled this word out
on a scrap of paper putting it into his
school book later that day he&#39;s come
home we&#39;re doing bedtime reading
together and he produces a new book the
first chapter was how to send a fax
now this wasn&#39;t the history section by
the way this was actually current
affairs rather worryingly I&#39;m privileged
to work with some incredibly smart
people from across the the world in this
field of AI and I&#39;ve not met anyone yet
there&#39;s forecasting a boom in the growth
of fax machine engineers and anytime
soon so I thought this isn&#39;t a great
start how are we preparing our kids in
the schooling system for this uncertain
future I thought back to the drawing
board we need another go at this so what
a kids love if your kids and nephews and
nieces and grandchildren or anything
like mine they love mainly to steal my
mobile phone download a game on it play
it till the battery&#39;s bled dry and hand
it back saying thanks teddy so I thought
I&#39;d use this to my advantage and in the
course of my work I had come across an
amazing game produced by MIT in the u.s.
called the moral machine and this game
opposes ethical conundrums for you to
look at in terms of an AI powered
self-driving car a very real implication
facing is in the years to come and it
basically crowdsources the opinions to
understand how do you in view ethics
into decision-making in cars in
life-and-death situations so let&#39;s have
a look at one of the games that the kids
played so you can see here you&#39;ve got a
car self-driving three women two young
kids barreling towards certain death
against this barrier and crossing the
road illegally I hasten to add are for
elderly people and a woman so what did
the kids decide to do they swerve they
take out the people crossing the road
illegally so you work through about 12
of these scenarios and it provides you
with a whole set of analysis about what
your propensity is for the preservation
of life so let&#39;s just um pick some of
these now the one that really stood out
to me and we are in the Living Planet
Center my kids have a strong preference
for the preservation of animals over
humans are thought very noble indeed and
the other one that are very proud about
they have a very strong preference
upholding the law so clearly my
parenting skills are actually okay now
these rules aren&#39;t perfect clearly it&#39;s
a bit of a gimmick but it has certainly
given me and certainly the kids a
glimpse of this future that we can&#39;t
exactly foresee and I think with that
glimpse you
right realize that kids even though if
quite a tender age do have the
capability to understand the
implications and comprehend some of
these really difficult situations so we
are absolutely going to face in the
years ahead
but I thought I keep going down this
track it wasn&#39;t quite convinced that
kind of got the message here back in
March of this year
I had the privilege of being appointed
to a parliamentary advisory board that
was convened in order to look at some of
these UK policy issues to understand how
do we responsibly adopt this technology
the first session back in March was very
much a high-level view to bring about a
dozen MPs Lords up to speed on the
question what is a I and write a lot
reports of work the first one I produce
was perfectly credible and professional
but it was probably not really
resonating with me and my colleagues
that were presenting this information so
the day before getting a little bit
anxious a thought and needed some
inspiration here I thought who better to
ask than the very people whose lives
will be most impacted by this technology
so we cleared the dishes away after
Sunday lunch we sat down and I said to
the kids kids what is a I mean to you
and after a few seconds of bewildered
silence and probably some serious
concern for my welfare my my daughter
asked me though this daughter said but
daddy what is AI that&#39;s a good question
imagine if you have robots with brains
in them that can decide to do things for
themselves what sorts of issues does
that challenge you know and what sort of
implications does that bring and we had
the most amazing fun inspiring chat for
about 15 minutes you know tossing around
all these different scenarios of if
robots could do x y&amp;z well after about
15 minutes they&#39;ve got a new game where
they go to my Amazon Alexa and they&#39;ve
created a new language called gobble in
that they used to train to confuse the
Alexa so they weren&#39;t often did that for
another 15 minutes afterwards but it was
an interesting chat and it gave me some
initial ideas nonetheless I was still a
little bit anxious as I prepared to
leave the next day to head to a pretty
important day in Parliament and just as
I was about to make for the front door
my thoughts came up to me and said daddy
please can you show this to the bosses
of the world
we&#39;ve written some
robot rules for you to go and show them
let&#39;s just on pick these rules if you
they&#39;re human me for a moment
bad people should not build robots now
we&#39;ve seen a lot of stories in the press
of late where AI has gone bad it&#39;s led
to damaging outcomes we&#39;ve seen
situations where recruitment AI has led
to if preferring men over women in the
workplace we&#39;ve seen chat BOTS that have
been trained by the public and they&#39;ve
ended up becoming a racist and we&#39;ve
even seen recently in the last month for
facial recognition AI that&#39;s able to
determine if you&#39;re straight in gay can
you just imagine the implications of
this technology has already this is not
in you know 15 years time on the flip
side however all of us have bias and
there is a great opportunity with AI to
uphold human rights to think about how
do we mitigate the risks of bias and
improve equality in the country
there&#39;s a really it&#39;s an interesting
area of AI because the AI is very much a
production of our and own inherent
biases it reflects how we are from
within and the work force at the moment
is very modulus so in order to build
great AI that is representative of all
parts of society we have to have a work
force that is also representative of all
parts of society to ensure that it is is
going to produce the outcomes we want
rule number 2 there has to be an off
switch now I don&#39;t know if anyone seen
in the press recently we&#39;ve had
luminaries in academia and Elon Musk
pointing out this category of what we
call AI safety what happens if this
technology becomes so smart that it
takes over it finishes all off and it
removes us all from the from from there
you know from their point of view now
there is a number of people that say
well hang on if it&#39;s just technology if
he starts going rogue we just pull the
plug out we turn the switch off however
if it becomes so smart and one estimate
forecasts that if we see exponential
growth in the power of this technology
in 20 years time it will be eight
thousand times more powerful than it is
today so what might be quite a dumb
theory chatbot in your phone at the
moment would be a thousand times more
powerful it might just have deduced that
its power supply is a major point of
vulnerability and it would have taken
the necessary countermeasures to protect
its own
self-interests this is all under this
category of existential risk these
long-range risks that threaten the very
much of humanity to my point of view
however though I think it&#39;s important to
focus on these long-range risks but also
to focus very much on how this is
already affecting our lives for good and
for worse rule number three there
shouldn&#39;t be bombs in robots now this is
a very interesting situation we&#39;ve got a
situation where we&#39;ve got weaponized
robots in drones as a mainstay of modern
warfare I&#39;ve had to tell the kids that
were breaking this rule already but
we&#39;re now moving into this field of
autonomous weapon systems weapons that
can decide who to selectively kill on
their own terms and there&#39;s been the
number of issues and and been raised by
people around the world there&#39;s an open
letter signed by 20,000 people looking
at how we start tackling this and that&#39;s
the question should we delegate
responsibility for selecting who lives
and who dies to an autonomous system or
should that always be the preserve of
humans and finally well number four
robots should not look like humans so
this is a really contentious question I
mean many of you all have seen these
things in the press of late on this side
of this you take countries like Japan
that have a very ageing workforce an
aging population a shortfall in the
social care and healthcare workforce
they provide a very practical solution
to resolving some of that and also
providing a novel method of
companionship on the other hand there&#39;s
a real concern about the attribution of
human characteristics to this technology
something called anthropomorphism and if
we start giving this away we then
protect what makes us humans you know
the ability to have empathy to care and
to love it has a real risk that it
affects the very fabric of life so that
was pretty inspiring I took that away
and a wonderful day in Parliament as I
as I left the house and got to the
station I&#39;ve quite addicted to Twitter
I&#39;ll be honest and I posted this and it
exploded with retweets and likes and
comments from around the world and that
continued to grow throughout the day and
I got home that day and this had kids
200,000 people from around the world
have read your rules and it&#39;s growing
day by day they&#39;re absolutely fascinated
by this I&#39;ve been rather overwhelmed by
the disgust
since happened it&#39;s been blogged about
it&#39;s been featured at conferences it&#39;s
been gently challenged you know in open
discussions if someone even cheaply
suggested it could be a good replacement
for Isaac Asimov&#39;s Three Laws of
Robotics so kudos kids and then the
highlight of this was that Professor
Knohl Sharkey from BBC Robot Wars also
endorsed it and there&#39;s no denying
Parliament sorry I&#39;ll get back to that
signing the rules into it effect so what
this has really shown me is that
actually kids are very very capable of
comprehending some of these big
questions that humanity has to ask they
will be the ones that will be inheriting
this maybe rather than teaching kids to
become something we have to trust them
that they should be able to find their
own way to think through these big
complex problems and from my perspective
I think we now need to start hardwiring
this into the school curricula I think
we should speak to our MPs about this we
should speak to our school teachers
about this we are not in need to produce
a whole army of fax machine engineers
looking back over this last six months
or so it&#39;s really taught me one thing if
we really are serious about this we need
to engage our children however we also
need to include all parts of society
everyone across all walks of life have
to contribute to the way that we shape
and govern and rule this technology so
it&#39;s in our interests but in particular
I think we should have to include our
kids in this who better to write the
robot rules thank you
[Applause]
