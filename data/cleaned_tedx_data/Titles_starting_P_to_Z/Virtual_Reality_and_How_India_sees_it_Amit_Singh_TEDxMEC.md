hi everyone I am a mix and first of all
I would like to thank Antigua for giving
me an opportunity to speak at TEDx so I
am my team are integrating virtual
reality I will all of you know about
virtual reality and I have seen you that
so we are integrating virtual reality in
the architecture design and we aim to
transform the world education system
with this virtual range into this
digital world finding new ways to engage
students to increase the knowledge
retention this is it very difficult so
so how we are doing to use new
technologies to address deeper today I
am going to share of your bringing
change in education system so computer
technology has been a massive industry
and have been growing tremendously past
50 years classrooms around the world
have already started preparing for the
next generation now students are using
tablets it&#39;s not sense and even do a
learning programming even from like very
early age virtually it is the next big
step in the direction and it&#39;s our
responsibility we should I begin like
the best opportunity possible so David
Burns is scientist published learning
knowledge in 1984 and he said learning
is the knowledge learning is the process
where knowledge is created through the
transformation of experiences and it&#39;s
it really provides Ubaid opportunity to
engage students 20 students creatively
emotionally socially and physically
include the work environment
so I know most of you know about virtual
reality and it&#39;s a technology which
really refers you to the centroid it
cuts you off from the way from the whole
world and you can even see you are a
little different
annulment so because these are we are xx
because you just need to want your eyes
and you will feel a little bit it is a
huge potential to communicate because a
huge potential to share your experience
in there is a so I would like to tell
you how it all started so let&#39;s go back
in 2010 I language - I had a root key to
pursue a Bachelor of architecture there
I met people across India will perform
in different states religion with
different traditions what I learned from
them is they they every individual Hotel
indeed some somewhere will including
somewhere would be music somewhere
goodness speeds someone who even last
but not the each somewhere with us Yonex
can&#39;t just get so and all in all every
individual is telling it in a sub in any
way and doing the S the Cambridge or
press India so I was going from a legal
of small city in October dish when I
have stayed when I was in school I
didn&#39;t an opportunity to her smartphone
to using laptops or computer nowadays
you can see everything as is on PC or
laptop is not shown here in our schools
so the first interaction with computer I
had the Spears computer lab where I was
at the time I was like very few days
either very intuitive to know where it
is
technology so encouraged as I left
opportunity to interact with individuals
women have diverse c-webb diverse skill
sets then I realize we have so much to
learn
we have so much to share drive each
other to each other then I realize the
power of sharing thoughts the power of
sharing imagination the power of human
collaboration that&#39;s what we are lacking
in our system so I will incident when I
was in first year at my college
yeah so it&#39;s one of my professors class
and he asked me to submit an assignment
so here the relay we have to submit in
tester you have to submit the
assignments in like hind optic drawings
hi I hope you hope the fantastic line
drawings you you&#39;re c90 this kind of
drawings and then being an architecture
student you have to go through all of it
so I was very curious to integrate
structures we&#39;ll explore different
technologies and I was directly in this
but the challenge was the department has
also every day all that submission the
software submission are only acceptable
from 30 rights or onwards and when I was
in first year that I want I wanted to do
it so I did it
the major officer refused me refused to
accept assignment then I requested him
so please you can you accept it and he
said like you are in first year you
can&#39;t use circus you have to you have to
like submit a hand-drawn details okay so
I keep it so I let both versions of a
team assignment behind on and the
software version and
and then back to the professor and
submit it and then I realize going back
to the hostel I realize this is our
system which is emitting us why do we
fear it too
why do we fear I&#39;ve changed why do the
afraid of bring new innovations in a
regular education system so there are
many tours and here passes and we really
need to bring that perception we need to
look beyond the perceive the imitations
that you have because which inhibits us
and also limits the big about you keep
coming to us so as I tell you I I was
ready in two factors technology I have
to hear it so even I used to make
simulations even the building in SST so
itself this analyst incident and might
merger so he&#39;s one of my professor is
used to teach me coming to the
architecture and he is really passionate
about it so I remember one of his
lecture he was lecturing on a very
famous one in our house you can see the
VD which has a very unique feature it&#39;s
constructed all the water hell it&#39;s in
u.s. so it&#39;s a part of curriculum so we
were so excited and he is also free
passionate about it even he debated with
next week lecture particular on this
topic and V was swelling to it and
behavior on to visited because he really
he was actually the dam explaining each
and every concept that we want to get
them he was trying to convey that I
realize are you going to communicate
exactly what we having online I learned
at the time there was no medium to
communicate as
verse we have in our mind so yesterday I
[Applause]
got the high EMFs vanish with many
unanswered questions in my head so I got
paged
when I you will be MNC of an architect
but I thought I I want to exclude the
technological dirt so I will them to die
deep improve the technological world so
I refused that offer and I joined a
different design consultancy as an
interaction designer where I used to
develop communications Android equations
between different kind of applications
there was another incident I was like 9
9 to 5 job it&#39;s very pretty much similar
to an engineering graduates life 9 to 5
job so suddenly it was a wave back
Micahel
if I have my birthday so I got this gate
this messy t-shirt I drew I have behaved
[Music]
very much looking inside this one in my
mind dying on this so we get back our
friends to give you movie passes concert
passes or long drive but it was to be
different thing then I will end it
itself can do description it&#39;s a target
I this was the first time I was
interacting with the virtual reality
device and I really I really didn&#39;t know
about it then I then my friend asked me
to put it let us forgive us because envy
and just put my phone into Israel you
have to place your phone like this it&#39;s
like this
as soon as I put my phone on the way and
for my eyes I was ready boom hi I need
five dollars to be in two different
environment I was so excited us to be a
comedy short film I was so excited I
couldn&#39;t believe my eyes
like I - I see - thankfully I have to be
a member so Brits really stuck into my
mind and I kept on exploring different
applications and after few weeks others
learning of them are the where so then I
like what else I want to experi as
method only from architecture I really
want to experience meetings inside it so
[Applause]
applications on so I was running out of
faith so I decided to integrate that
kind of thing to experience village - to
integrate this kind of thing in this in
a system so I just it was just an idea
so I met my friend he is my dear friend
know you he will be my roommate since my
college days so this is the idea and I
am unit length I want to integrate this
kind of technology or the kind of
application of this in our education
stand kick is edited yeah we can try so
we met hundreds of people there at that
time whether you even know about it
and in the very few of them were how to
build this and that was a struggle then
so we are coming from a architecture
background yeah
but the best part is in IIT give an
opportunity to learn the basics of
coding the C++ HTML or not so but to
develop applications we only made are
differentiated so we really
to guide deep into the programming part
so after seven months of spending
sleepless nights we came up with the
first virtual reality experience of a
building the same way that my professors
used to teach me the body model house
and then we showed it to professor like
he was pretty fascinated he met him he
was making eiope and he&#39;s I have been
teaching this same building for past 25
years and he was learning Irish diverse
so we are this is the C and he he was
sure even literally into tears so when
he put it imagine how this feminine an
IP virtual everybody has his own
visualisation path has his own thoughts
to create an imagined 8 hip world inside
his own head
the totality the fact the details very
good early individuals capacity we all
have sorts imagination in our mind right
and virtual reality have a potential to
communicate the same visual experience
that you have in your mind and that&#39;s
this really busy
Avista I call it a human experience a
medium to communicate of human
experience because with nearly inverse
other senses which makes you free you
are in into the real and moment and I
strongly be where you see is seeking you
but you are really passionate about
something if you are really dedicated
about something you are working hard to
build it moving does make you achieve it
there are chains mill going to please
integration and this is not happening to
us so we have it also idea which is
natural in experiential learning
platform and our queen our duty
this would create the curriculum into
the experiential planet with the
settlers were generally not only helps
the students to understand the complex
subjects well in a one-seat day that
also had teachers explain the
complexities of it in a very you must&#39;ve
ate so imagination this is the source of
all human achievements and I believe in
extension to the store ie will become a
vanity the to communicate a share
experience share our imagination our
rate of achievements visually youth so
being that we were started training
students professionals learn about this
energy and use this technology in their
own progress and learn how to design the
rubbish in virtual reality

so our broader region is not destroyed
and with the education system but to do
something for better well provided
tomorrow so I VI IV lay that you only
should be accessible to its target
audience
irrespective of this financial
boundaries so I decided to launch tube
is this red and and also the one of the
bottom that we have we always trying to
reach future by work we get in the wash
and this is a big way and they really
need to change our perception and does
not need a and we launch we are watch
Anna vigil idea for a run again this is
notice in your first we are come to them
under divinities I they want to bring
down the energy to brass material where
everyone gets to hazel I hear grandpa
rustic people Sardinia thank you
