this is my daughter Izzy and like all
children she simultaneously makes me
want to laugh and pull whatever hair I
have left on my head out however she has
been the single most important thing has
ever happened to me as an educator you
see four years ago she started school
and for the very first time I knew what
it was like to be on the other side of
the fence because of Izzy
she made me question who I was as an
educator she made me think why my
students were in that classroom and more
importantly she made me think what
school was all about today I want to
share a little bit about this journey
but more importantly I want to make you
think about one thing children want to
matter is Izzy on the very first day of
kindergarten by the sounds of your
voices do you think she&#39;s kind of cute
and though I&#39;m a little biased I would
have to agree with you
however she&#39;s not the easiest child to
get along with and in fact she got in a
lot of physical fights with both her
teacher and her peers I know it&#39;s hard
to believe and this caused a not so
positive experience for her in the
kindergarten but this also caused my
wife and I to go on an amazing journey
that we&#39;re still on we took it to a lot
of consults we took her to see some
occupational therapy and finally speech
where we found out that she was the
first percentile for expressive language
and 56 percentile for receptive language
basically she could take everything in
but could not tell you how she was
feeling no wonder she struggled in
kindergarten it was also around this
time that Angela mayor spoke at a
conference where she said these two
words you matter and she said that these
two words will change the lives of
children and affect their future forever
you can see why these two words really
resonated with me I was also reading a
book called the explosive child by dr.
Ross green at this point for obvious
reasons dr. green
talks about the collaborative
problem-solving approach for dealing
with behavior basically build a
relationship first understand the
underlining ideas and then address the
behavior now I don&#39;t know about you but
this might go against everything that we
may have thought about raising children
at least for me when I grew up it was
spare the rod spoil the child but that
doesn&#39;t work for some children and it
definitely doesn&#39;t work in education
unless you want to be in the blue pages
my daughter is not alone in this journey
there are many children that we have in
our school system that are just
misunderstood this is one of my students
that I had last year and before he came
to our school we were told that he was a
big behavior basically we were told
watch out and so I did watch out for a
bit but I didn&#39;t notice that behavior
what I noticed was high anxiety
reclusiveness he didn&#39;t even want to
make friends and so I pulled him aside
and I said to him hey what&#39;s up and we
had a big long chat but in that
conversation he goes to me you know mr.
so the other school just thought I was
annoying I chuckled a little because I
also said well I think you&#39;re annoying
too but I love that part about you in
fact that&#39;s what makes me like you even
more
you see this child was not a behavior he
was just misunderstood Daniel Seeger
author of no drama discipline offers
this acronym to think about misbehaviors
he says when you think of MS behaviors
think of this children act out when they
are hungry angry lonely and tired
in fact most adults do as well I was so
proud of this student at the end of the
year he came to me and said mr. so I
can&#39;t control my anger at the moment
it&#39;s not the people around me it&#39;s me
and I need a break I was so proud that
he was able to communicate that feeling
to me it was truly remarkable I was also
at this point that
Stuart Sheng Kurds were fell in my lap
this has probably been one of the most
influential pieces of literature that I
have read in a very long time both as an
educator and as a parent Stuart says at
the beginning of his book that he&#39;s
never met a bad child I want you to
think about that for a minute because I
know we&#39;ve all had the stories or heard
those stories of that child in fact I
probably was that child but there&#39;s
nothing like a healthy dose of reality
to put everything into perspective and
it was amazing to see huge changes in my
daughter as my wife and I put in some
places around anxiety
more importantly the following year her
teacher put in some great relationship
building and there was one day that I
picked up my daughter from school and
she goes you know what is he came to
school and today I was like old boy she
came in with a goggles and a housecoat
in the middle of September heatwave I
was like oh great but she said no it was
like The Big Lebowski and I just had to
laugh because this teacher understood
who my daughter was in a nutshell she
knew a story that was behind all the
stories and so you can see why when
Angela stood in from the crowd and said
those two words you matter why those
words resonated with me so much in fact
it resonated with me so much that I
started at that very moment at you
matter board with my students this was a
board where we could put our dreams our
aspirations we even gave compliments to
one another and we told stories about
one another next to it was at a vice
wall this was a place where kids could
tell other kids of how to be successful
you know at first we got listen be nice
this is a funny one if mr. so yells at
you you probably deserved it
but I got these ones as well be with
people who make you better love be
outstanding it was at that moment that I
saw real change in my students we also
started community circles community
circles for me was a place where we
could talk about our Dreeben tsa&#39;s talk
about our problems that were happening
out in the playground we offered no
names no biases we just talked
we offered strategies to one another and
my students really started to mature and
grow my principal always asks this
question to me Jonathan what&#39;s the
difference that&#39;s making the difference
and at this moment I didn&#39;t really know
what to say to them so I asked them I
said what is the difference that&#39;s
making the difference what they said to
me you listen it&#39;s like really what what
do you mean by that
I listen yet mister so whether it&#39;s
about a pencil that we lost or it&#39;s an
argument with our best friend you listen
to us you don&#39;t offer judgment you
listen and then offer suggestions Wow
listen I want to offer another story to
you this happened when my daughter was
five years old my daughter wanted to
make a fire truck in Minecraft at this
point in time I had no idea what
minecraft was so she goes don&#39;t worry
daddy we can YouTube it and so she did
she YouTubed it herself and design and
built a fire truck in Minecraft like all
my students is he has an amazing story
and of course downfalls but that&#39;s what
makes her special for the very first
time last year I had an emotional
connection to my students I&#39;ve never had
before
now for those of you know me you can
even ask my wife I&#39;m traditionally not
an emotional person but I cried almost
putting together the slideshow at the
end of the year it was because I knew
who my students were as if I knew my own
kids we&#39;ve heard amazing things today
you are amazing people or you wouldn&#39;t
be spending the last hour and even then
more so
listening to amazing talks you know of
all the truly innovative classrooms that
we have heard about or seen in the news
but I want to ask you one thing if
children don&#39;t want to be there does all
of that really matter when Angela said
those two words you matter they will
change lives they will affect the future
I asked you at the beginning of the talk
to think about that one thing students
and children want to matter and I hope
you have because when our children our
students know that they are loved
welcomed part of a community they will
do anything for you so am i in this talk
today by saying thank you and know this
each and every one of you today matter
to me
