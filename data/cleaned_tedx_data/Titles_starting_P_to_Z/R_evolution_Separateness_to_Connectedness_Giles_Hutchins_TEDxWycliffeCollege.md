over the next quarter of an hour so we
are going to immerse ourselves in a
revolution a revolution with profound
consequences for ourselves our systems
and our civilization and this revolution
isn&#39;t about digitization or
globalization or disruptive innovations
or any of the other macro trends that
futurists tend to point to no
in fact this revolution isn&#39;t out there
at all it&#39;s in here in our own hearts
and minds so revolution in consciousness
from separateness to connectedness that
is ripping up the rulebook about how we
view life and our sense of place and
purpose within it so let&#39;s cut to the
chase myriad disciplines are the
forefront of Western science such as
quantum physics depth psychology
facilitation ecology nuove ology many
areas are discovering with increasingly
sophisticated instruments in experiments
we are proving the innate weave and weft
of this world in a interrelation
allottee of this reality and of course
this discovery isn&#39;t new it&#39;s as fresh
as it is ancient because it resonates
with a timeless wisdom of prophets
philosophers Sears and Shaymin
throughout the ages who have long
understood this innate interrelation
ality of life but today we&#39;re proving it
with our reductive experiments and it
has the potential to change everything
because still today we are largely
caught up in a worldview that is rooted
in separation competition
control and domination still today we
serve up to our children in our schools
to our adults in our business schools a
recipe of neo-darwinism that views life
through threat tinted glasses
separate species struggling for survival
in a dog-eat-dog world
the whole process of evolution seen
through this lens of selfish ascendancy
the unit of evolution The Selfish Gene
within us and this is a deeply divisive
logic and it&#39;s woefully inadequate and
yet it underpins much of our
socio-economic thinking in business
politics and beyond this illusion of
separation that we&#39;ve created in our own
minds is castrating us from nature from
our deeper human nature from each other
and from the world around us it creates
what Albert Einstein insightfully
referred to as an optical delusion of
consciousness which creates increasing
fear anxiety egotism individualism and
consumerism it&#39;s this floored worldview
this broad way of attending which is
actually at the heart of our challenges
today and yet so often whilst trying to
find solutions to this trilemma of
social economic and environmental crises
now upon us we apply the very same level
of consciousness that created our
problems in the first place to our well
intended solutions we simply don&#39;t have
time for this anymore
this is humanity&#39;s hour of reckoning we
need to get radical and deal with the
root cause which is this flawed way of
attending the good news is as I say
forefront of myriad disciplines in
Western science we are exploring just
this we are dispelling this illusion of
separation so that we can sense into the
deeper connectedness of our humanity in
this more than human world so let me
give you some examples now to bring this
alive let&#39;s take a tree let&#39;s say in
English oak tree in an English wood root
using our old neo-darwinian logic this
oak tree would have best be interested
in it
offspring vehicle but now we know with
our radioactive tracings and so forth we
can show that the tree is showing
nutrients for the holly sapling it&#39;s in
a different part of the forest areas
rich in minerals are sharing with areas
poor in minerals and we really struggle
to understand what&#39;s going on when we
apply this old logic take you and I here
today we now know that at least 90% of
the cells in our bodies aren&#39;t even
human without the help of these
non-human cells you and I would utterly
fail at life and when we drill down and
look at one of these cells we see that
it&#39;s surrounded by a semi permeable
membrane continuously interrelating with
its environment in fact the more we look
the more we see that everywhere this
interrelation allottee is a hallmark
property of life in fact hard line
definitive boundaries of complete
separation simply don&#39;t exist anywhere
except in our own minds assumptions of
convenience that we&#39;ve created to help
us make sense of atomized
compartmentalized categorize and
objectify the world around us now this
way of attending this ability to
objectify an abstract and define is an
important part of what makes us human we
need it unless these definitions begin
to tyrannize over us to such an extent
that they actually desensitize us from
the very world we&#39;re trying to make
sense of so let&#39;s drill down even
further in the cell and look at the
genes within the cell not these units of
selfish ascendancy as neo-darwinism
would have us believe what we actually
find a dynamic locality&#39;s learning
participating with our environment what
we thought was 97 percent junk DNA we
now realize is continuously
interrelating at local and non
who levels with its environment
transforming our view of meta genetics
drill down even further into the cell
and you come across the atoms and
subatomic particles within the cell not
the hard masse impenetrable objects of
Newtonian physics no what we actually
find a quark strings vibrations of light
humming away to their own unique shoes
it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s all inspiring the most
fundamental level what we find are these
electromagnetic vibrations of light are
immersed within an all-pervasive
see an ocean what scientists called a
quantum vacuum the zero-point energy
field the ground of all being and for
many of these scientists that sense into
this they have mystical experiences for
instance david bohm brilliant first-rate
british scientist sent into the
formlessness that informs all form now a
metaphor might be useful here to help
convey this so let&#39;s take the wave on
the ocean
h wave has its own form its own
fingerprint if you like no two waves are
ever the same but the wave is never
separate from the ocean and that&#39;s the
same to these electromagnetic vibrations
that make up the appearance of matter to
our senses they are immersed in this
ocean of into being we are immersed in
this ocean of interbeing
and what&#39;s really interesting is that we
can now show with our increasingly
sophisticated instruments and expense we
can prove what happens when we shift our
consciousness from a state of
separateness self a separate form and in
competition with the world to a state of
connectedness of opening up to this
ground of being through contemplative
and embodiment practices we see what
happens physiologically and
psychologically we change tissue repair
rates improve stem cell reproduction
improves
hormones change senses liven the sign
actual connections in our brain enhance
brainwave frequencies change the left
and right brain hemispheres interrelate
more readily the head the heart and the
gut in train we become more human our
ability to empathize and see different
perspectives increases our ability to
sense into subtly knit synchronistic
pathways in our midst
all enhances our ability for compassion
wisdom and intuition all improves the
very qualities that we need to lead and
change and adapt in these times of
fast-moving volatility all come on
screen and my work is mainly in business
and in the corridors of power corporate
boardrooms and conference halls that I
speak and advise that I sense winds of
change flowing through challenging the
structures and strictures by which we
operate and organize and now I&#39;d like to
share with you how this revolution in
consciousness is manifesting in business
perhaps the most powerful human creative
force on the planet today essentially
what we&#39;re seeing is a shift in
perspective from viewing the
organizations and machine top-down
hierarchical owed sweating its assets
for short-term returns one of those
assets being Human Resources to
realizing the organization is actually a
living system a living system that
interrelates intimately interrelates
with the living systems of society which
intimately interrelate with the living
systems of our more than human world and
that&#39;s quite a big shift for how we lead
and operate and the good news is we can
take inspiration from living systems
within us and all around us to help us
with this shift as much that we can
learn from nature these days to help our
organizations become more phew
fit and I&#39;ll share with you now one key
principle which is that of divergence
and convergence so divergence is opening
up and convergence is binding together
and out of that tension comes the third
which is emergence the way in which we
find our flow the way in which we become
more of who we are we find our niche in
an ever-changing ecosystem we realize
our evolutionary potential really
important what we now know what helps
our organizations become more resilient
more vibrant more future fit in these
times of volatility is that we need to
encourage that divergence encourage that
divergence to decentralize decision
making distributed decision-making that
empowers teams to make change happen at
the local level so they can locally
attune to the ever-changing environment
without having to rely on hierarchies of
bureaucracy in control and that
divergence also comes with diversity
celebrating diversity not just in terms
of age creed culture and gender as
important as that is in the workplace
but also in terms of perceptual horizon
how we see things bringing different
people from different parts of the silos
in the business so those silos permeate
more readily bringing different people
from different parts of the stakeholder
ecosystem so that organizational
membrane permeates more readily and that
divergence needs to be balanced with a
convergence otherwise the organization
becomes too amorphous too chaotic and
that convergence has traditionally come
through power based hierarchies of
control and domination
there&#39;s a whole philosophic and historic
reason for that born out of a
militarized mind rising patriarchy the
ego explosion culminating in this
scientific revolution with its focus on
rationalism and materialism which still
underpinned so much of our scientific
management theory
in business today and there&#39;s really
useful aspects in that that we need
going forward certainly but as a
dominant power dine its unfit for
purpose for the world that we&#39;re now in
and what we&#39;re now seeing is that
convergence is being replaced with a
resonant sense of purpose and we can
enhance this resonance sense of purpose
when a threshold of people within the
organization deeply resonate with the
organization sense of purpose and some
sociological studies show us that there
can be as little as 10% of people in the
organization when they deeply resonate
with that organizational sense of
purpose a tipping point is reached a
threshold is crossed work on the
consciousness of the organization comes
alive it becomes easier for us to let go
of those power based hierarchies of
control or run them in parallel and
allow more self-organizing more emergent
more empowering a more human ways of
operating but what&#39;s really interesting
is what we can see to deepen this
resonance in times of fast-moving change
the organizational sense of purpose
needs to touch our humanity as meaning
seeking purposeful creatures of we are
and so the organizational sense of
purpose needs to be more than maximizing
profits or becoming number one in the
marketplace what we&#39;re realizing is that
sense of purpose needs to be about
enhancing life creating the conditions
conducive for life to flourish leaving
the garden which of them we found that
improving Society the environment and
the economy and that&#39;s why we now see in
business these four piece
purpose people planet profit profit
flows on that purpose not the other way
round and this isn&#39;t some kind of
utopian dream some nice to have vision
to be attained with in times of Plenty
but discarded as soon as the going gets
tough no what we&#39;re now realizing is
this
whore this is essential to what enables
our organizations to become future fit
to thrive in these times of increased
volatility and we can see this
manifesting in business right before our
very eyes now with the exponential
growth of movements such as the purpose
movement teal evolutionary conscious
capitalism he corpse let&#39;s take B corpse
for instance as an example started off
with a handful of mission driven
businesses in North America now over
2000 organizations around the world
signing up to change their legal
Constitution voluntarily away from
short-term returns to shareholders to
creating value for all stakeholders
including society in the environment and
not seeing this as some kind of moral
burden or duty but realizing this
creates the very vitality the very
purposeful mission driven
entrepreneurial creative life force that
the organization needs to thrive in
these times of fast-moving change and so
it&#39;s a very exciting time to be involved
in the future of business and so I&#39;ll
finish on a quote from the
well-respected business futurist John
Nesbitt who says that the greatest
breakthroughs of the 21st century will
not occur because of technology they
will occur because of an expanding
concept of what it means to be human now
I love that to be involved in this
expanding concept of what it means to be
human to help as human beings live up to
our name as Homo sapiens wise beings in
this deeply wise interconnected and
sentient world thank you very much
[Applause]
