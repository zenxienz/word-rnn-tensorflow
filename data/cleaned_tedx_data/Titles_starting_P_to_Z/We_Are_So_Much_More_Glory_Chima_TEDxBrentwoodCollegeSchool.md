at nine years old she was raped and
bought off with an ice-cream cone to
keep it quiet that she had been alone
with her cousin she was pregnant by 14
she gave birth to a chance to redeem
herself from all the pain she had seen
in the span of a decade but two weeks
later that chance passed away along with
their hopes of making something out of
nothing to recover from her shame her
name is Oprah Winfrey when he was two
years old he was estranged by his dad
with whom he shared the same name and he
could never avoid the insults at school
because the color of his skin and the
size of his ears weren&#39;t considered cool
and when he looked at himself they did
not seem to get any clearer but there
was something wrong with the man that he
saw in the mirror but Barack Obama is
his name when you look all these times
that have shown that nothing is ever
really set in stone it&#39;s hard not to
wonder who ever thought that our past
has to show any indication of her future
because then Obama never would have
become a side for change and Oprah might
still be hanging her head in shame and I
probably would not be up here today I
was a shy kid growing up and I had stage
fright it&#39;s kind of ironic isn&#39;t it but
from kindergarten my words were trapped
inside my mouth handcuffed by thoughts
that convicted me of a reality of
mediocrity I had formed the illusion
inside my head that the things I said we
run exciting at most I was not ready to
step out of my comfort zone it was my
home the one place I knew I could always
count on to keep me safe because forget
sticks and stones
it&#39;s can crush our dreams you can try
put a band-aid over the bruise what the
blood will just strip through the seams
nobody wants to hear that they can&#39;t
defy gravity nobody wants to hear that
they don&#39;t have the key but they don&#39;t
got what it takes and even though our
backgrounds create a collage of
different shapes and sizes and
compromises our imperfections and
rejections leave us all trapped in the
same box labeled inadequate my comfort
zone was my home the place I knew I
could go to avoid all the titles and
labels so I locked my voice into a box
that meant only I you&#39;d have to find the
key so I didn&#39;t have to hear the
multitudes of ways people use their
voice to define mine because sometimes
when we take a step out of the comforts
of our own home we step into a war zone
of judgment put downs and opinions and
sometimes we&#39;ll get shot straight in the
chest and people will leave us with
bruises and excuses as to why we could
never be good enough and most times we
can try and escape but our confidence is
not in good enough shape to fight off
all the words that stick in our brains
unable unmotivated subpar my comfort
zone was my home and a lot of the time
it just kind of went that way because
there are so many aspirations that have
been broken and thousands of dreams that
people have left unspoken because flames
of enthusiasm were put out with a splash
of ridicule and I never wanted to be the
same but when I think of Oprah and how
she recovered from her shame and I think
of Obama and all that he became I have
to ask
who says we can&#39;t do the same
we are all fighting on this battleground
trying to defend ourselves from bullets
aimed at our confidence dying to live to
attack some people who shoot daggers
into our aspirations people who leave us
surrendering to standards and
expectations people who doubt that we
will ever see it through people who we
will never hear say the words I believe
in you
there are so many aspirations that have
been broken and thousands of dreams that
people have left unspoken because people
measure our capacities by what they&#39;ve
seen in the past by our failures for
what they don&#39;t see is a time as we get
up early to push ourselves a little
further and what they don&#39;t see is a
time sweet down the inside when they
tell us to try a little harder and what
they don&#39;t see is a fire that burns
inside of us to show that we are good
enough so prove them wrong we are all
fighting on this battleground trying to
defend ourselves and bullets aimed at
our confidence trying not to give in to
the notions in our head that convinced
us to give up instead of pushing through
to the end trying not to give in to the
impression that because we have tried
and failed and cried and broken down
that our breakdowns indicate defeat and
defeat indicates a treat but retreat
leads us down a path to a destination
where we know we are not supposed to be
so prove them wrong
we are all fighting on this battleground
trying to defend ourselves from bullets
aimed at our confidence but taking a hit
does not mean that it is over because
our battle scars are just bits and
pieces of the masterpiece that all our
fears our history and our struggles will
one day create and it is going to be so
great when we can look back and realize
that there really was something in us
that no artist could ever paint and no
sculptor could ever make but we have got
to be willing to try and that&#39;s
something that took me 14 years to
realize we can&#39;t stay inside our comfort
zones and hide that we have to have that
drive we have to know that ambition is
going to be a lonely road that will
always look like it&#39;s leading us to
nowhere and we have to know that we will
meet people along the way that will
convince us to turn back because the end
of the road is just pitch black and that
we are bound to drown in a sea of
ordinary we&#39;ve got to believe that
there&#39;s something in us that cause us to
go down that path in the first place but
there&#39;s something in us that nobody
could ever erase that there is something
in us that is so much more than just our
circumstances that is so much more than
our failures that is so much more than
other people&#39;s opinions of us that is so
much more than our terror than our
fright than the things that never ever
seemed to go right we are so much more
once again I refer back to Oprah Oprah
Winfrey has gone through so much more
than the average human she was raped
repeatedly molested by family members
she had a baby lost her baby lost her
brother to AIDS and lost her job for
being too emotional yet today she is
considered one of the most influential
woman of our time and then there&#39;s Obama
Obama went looking in a mirror and
wondering if there was something wrong
with the man he would see suspending
eight years of his life reading a
country so what about you what&#39;s
stopping you I cannot stress enough that
there are too many aspirations that have
been broken and millions of dreams that
people leave unspoken but we cannot be
the same because we are so much more and
it&#39;s our responsibility to go after what
we want so when the day comes for us to
leave this earth we will be able to look
back and be satisfied so get better push
further fight longer do all that you can
to break down your walls and do all that
you can to show those people who made
you feel small because our failures will
never overtake us if our drive to
succeed is strong enough and our valleys
will never be too deep if the mountain
we want to climb is high enough but most
importantly our race will never seem to
long if the destination is worthy enough
and as we go along we will encounter
obstacle after obstacle and defeat after
defeat if we push hard enough if we
fight long enough
and if we work hard enough then we will
never ever be defeated thank you
[Applause]
