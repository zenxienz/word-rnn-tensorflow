thank you and so today I&#39;m here to
explain why it&#39;s time to be your own
doctor so I started my career as a
family physician in Mississauga Ontario
and the practice I joined took care of a
lot of patients including those in
nursing homes in retirement homes I
noticed very quickly that a lot of my
patients were taking pills to manage
their chronic conditions like heart
disease blood pressure issues arthritis
and diabetes and I really had more than
10 or 15 minutes to see these patients
that wasn&#39;t what I got taught at medical
school I was supposed to spend a lot of
time getting to learn to know them and
about their lives
and then there were the nursing home
patients now for many of them they were
there because of their complications of
their chronic conditions to a point that
it disabled them so that they could no
longer live independently at home you
might not be surprised by this but many
of them were on 10 or more medications a
day
wow what a cocktail and I used to think
these are uppers and downers because
many of these medications one of them
was chasing the side effect of the other
one you know now that I think about it I
may have been better off giving them a
prescription of a beer or a glass of
wine every day
you know one of the things is when I
stepped out and got back into my car
after I visited them was I used to ask
myself is this the way to celebrate ones
end of life in a place were you
deteriorating and for far too many few
family visited now I&#39;m gonna suggest
that many of you think that it&#39;s
inevitable to get sick and so we pray
that we have great doctors and hospitals
nearby increase a crisis happens I think
this is unfortunate because this is a
reactive model now the practice I had I
didn&#39;t have enough time to teach
patients to take care of themselves so
in essence by default I was contributing
to their illnesses and disabilities over
time I don&#39;t think that was what I
signed up for when I started medical
school so I had to think outside of this
traditional disease care model so what
did most people do they go back to
school and I did to think that I could
learn about how I could manage this
healthcare system differently
so the penny dropped for me one day in
my class and there&#39;s a golden rule in
business and that is to mitigate risk
almost at any cost now many of you are
entrepreneurs and you own your own
business how many of you would sit and
wait for crisis to happen and yet I
would suggest that far too many of us do
not mitigate our own disease risks now
by default because I am in a disease
care system I would be part of the
problem but I&#39;m here to say to you that
I am now part of the solution so after I
finished my MBA class I developed a
preventive holistic medic
care model in my practice and I&#39;m
actually deploying some of those same
principles in the businesses of my
patients so today I&#39;m here because I
want to talk to you about the importance
of changing the conversation from
understanding that our healthcare system
is a reactive and costly one and that we
need to become proactive because it not
only saves money but it saves life - now
we&#39;re in 2017 it&#39;s the beginning of the
gray tsunami and for the first time in
history there are more people over the
age of 65 than there are children under
the age of 15 now what does this mean it
means that chronic disease is on an
epidemic rise they will not be enough
hospital and nursing home beds for all
who need to be institutionalized and
need one and they&#39;ll not be enough
doctors to deliver a disease care
traditional model and they&#39;ll certainly
not be enough money to pay for all the
care if we continue to deliver it the
same way but I do believe that there is
a way out of this healthcare challenge
and that is we need to start activating
proven low-cost healthy lifestyle
behaviors so it reduces the chances of
us getting sick and not have to enter
this costly medical system today this is
called a wellness strategy now many
people would say to me well you know
what my disease risks are predetermined
by my genetics perhaps but I would like
to say that your genetic expression is
determined by how you carry out your
life whether you become sick or healthy
for a longer time
so I&#39;m here to say to you that wellness
is not voodoo
wellness strategies anchored in science
are effective now why should you believe
me I&#39;m I&#39;m just a family doctor but I&#39;m
gonna suggest to you that my proof is
the Nobel prize-winning science in fact
that proof is found inside of you at the
tips of your chromosomes called your
telomeres now your telomeres are like
the tips of your plastics on your
shoelaces they prevent your chromosomes
from prematurely unraveling and then
getting critically short and how slowly
or quickly you burn those telomeres will
2be tend on how frequently you engage in
negative lifestyle behaviors like
drinking and smoking or being injured or
being chronically ill and also being
exposed to pollution and chronic stress
all of these things accelerate your
telomeres in shortening which then
increases your risk of developing all
chronic conditions now what can you do
today to slow down that burn rate and
also regrow your telomeres it starts by
being more active eating better and
sleeping more I can hear your voice is
going that&#39;s simple but how many of you
do this well and everyday and I&#39;m going
to also suggest there&#39;s more you must
practice mindfulness practices and have
a fulfilling life purpose in order for
your team ears to regrow now I know it&#39;s
really really hard to take control back
of your life because we all have busy
lies and it&#39;s even though we want to
integrate healthy lifestyle behaviors
back into it it&#39;s really hard but I&#39;m
here to show you how you can
take back control of your life and your
health now it begins as simple as
becoming health literate most of you
have a cell phone
and inside of it there&#39;s an app there&#39;s
a health app that can track your
lifestyle and your vital signs and then
in the near future there&#39;s more in the
comfort of your own home you&#39;re going to
be able to very soon use specialized
probes that test your blood urine your
saliva and get results in real time and
when you mix genetics machine learning
and artificial intelligence to it your
software will tell you when you should
exercise what type of exercise what you
should eat today when you should go to
bed and best of all I think your 3d
printer at home will print out the exact
precise amount of supplements and
medications you need for that day at the
right dose yes I did say a 3d printer
today does print medications now you can
also contact your health professionals
virtually via video conferencing to
discuss all those results better still
because you&#39;re connected now to your
health providers they will give you a
call if you are falling off track now
maybe that&#39;s all kind of interesting to
you and you&#39;re gonna say where do I
start so I&#39;m going to suggest that maybe
you should start testing your genetics
and do your full genome and get it
decoded that thousand dollar genome has
arrived and if that&#39;s too much let&#39;s
talk about pharmacogenetics because you
can now genetically understand which
drug works for you at what dose so
you&#39;ll no longer be a victim of trial
and error prescribing you know we all
want to know what foods we should eat so
no more abstract ideas about eating
right for your blood type it&#39;s gonna be
precise eat right for your genotype and
also understand your food allergies and
tolerances so that you know what&#39;s good
for your body and don&#39;t eat the things
that your body doesn&#39;t lie
and then vitamin D our sunshine vitamin
genetically we know some of you don&#39;t
make vitamin D very well and if so we
should get your vitamin D tested by
blood but in fact I think you should
test all your vitamins all your minerals
and all your core organic amino and
fatty acids so that you know precisely
if you need to supplement or not and we
know that hormones play a very important
role in metabolism and weight management
if they&#39;re out of balance so you need to
get your hormones tested like your
insulin your growth hormone and these
two hormones are also impacted by your
stress hormone cortisol now mentally is
a big issue and I would encourage you to
understand the levels of your brain
chemicals these neurotransmitters can be
balanced and therefore it&#39;s your first
step in developing mental resiliency now
those are all very leading-edge tests so
I&#39;m going to suggest that you just start
by understanding and gain insights from
your blood pressure your weight and
understand how many steps you&#39;re taking
every day and how many hours of sleep
you&#39;re getting and you can generally a
food all this information together with
your medical reports can be shared with
your health professionals in turn
they&#39;ll be armed with more information
to help you understand how you can
develop a more personalized health
action plan and they&#39;ll be able to add
reminders and tasks to keep you on track
all of this can be attainable in its
functions on one platform where you put
your medical and your wellness
information in one place in one app this
is called a patient health record where
you are now looking at both your life
and wellness files now if being
proactive about your health sounds like
a good idea you must be at the center of
your own health journey and you must now
take control of all your health data and
certainly become your own primary care
practitioner
no longer should it be dog
but patient-centric and so it&#39;s really
important for you to now engage in your
own health care earlier I spoke about
the gray tsunami and I would suggest
that this generation is going to stress
our health care system and challenge it
and we must ensure that it survives for
them but also survive and thrive for our
children and grandchildren and certainly
life is for living to its fullest and we
should be able to enjoy our cottage and
go on ski trips with their friends and
family but always suggests that it&#39;s
equally important that you can self-care
with dignity in the comforts of your own
home at the later age stages of your
life so here&#39;s my perfect health action
plan I want to wake up one day and
discover myself dead but in heaven
knowing that I&#39;ve lived a long and
healthy life
but also a very fulfilling one so I&#39;m
here to say to you that growing old does
not mean that you need to be frail and
disabled at the end of your life you can
be your own game changer into
determining how that end of life looks
like for you by focusing and integrating
proven wellness strategies into your
life now it&#39;s my responsibility as a
doctor to look for solutions that keep
my patients healthy but I think it&#39;s
also time for you to take more personal
responsibly about your well-being
we need to act together now so I&#39;m going
to close this conversation by a very
great quote that Einstein put out and
you cannot solve a problem from the same
consciousness that created it you must
learn to see the world anew my ask of
you today is to see your healthcare anew
because your quality of life
depends on it thank you
