because of who I am and what I do I
think hold these insults and more I&#39;ve
been called a slut a vagina and legs a
blow-up fucked Oh some of these words
have come from clients from relatives
from people who&#39;ve claimed to have my
best interests at heart but mostly they
have come from feminists or to be
specific sex worker exclusionary radical
feminists otherwise known as swerves my
experience of this kind of abuse is
miniscule compared to how sex workers
are treated on a wider scale today and
historically we have consistently spoken
over and left out of feminist
discussions we are an easy example of
the violence of men the corruption of
capitalism the way women are brainwashed
ins are serving the patriarchy many
feminists are preoccupied with
eradicating the sex industry at the
expense of those in it and by failing to
recognize sex work for the physical and
emotional labor it is forget that most
importantly sex workers are human like
anyone else and deserve to have our
living and working conditions fought for
just the same as everyone else
instead of fighting for us they fight
against us
they focus on demands and discussions
that are completely reductive such as
whether or not I&#39;m empowered by my job
something the workers in other
industries are not repeatedly asked
before their job can be viewed as
legitimate empowerment is not a
prerequisite for human rights in fact
being given human rights is to step
towards empowerment not the other way
around
in March last year Swedish feminists
catcher occurs Eckman referred to thai
sex workers as cheap pussy empower
Foundation the Thai sex worker rights
Borg had this response perhaps you don&#39;t
know that sex workers in Thailand and
mothers and family providers tonight at
least 300,000 watts will go to work who
have never heard of you do not need to
agree with what we do to earn our living
however your disapproval should not be
allowed to incite hatred or stigma
against us this is just one example of
many where sex workers devalued and sex
workers are let down by and excluded
from feminism regardless of your moral
or theoretical problem of sex work
attempting to wipe it out does nothing
to help those in the industry what this
does do though is make surviving even
harder for those who are most
marginalized sex workers are often
working-class women of color migrants
queer many other mothers sometimes drug
users - who then face the double stigma
of being both sex worker and drug user
sex workers often the refuge of those
shut out from the dream of financial
security it has been a way for migrant
women the working class and women of
color to reverse the status quo as
through it they can gain access to
wealth and power by financially
profiting of something they&#39;re not meant
to financially profit from and is meant
to be controlled by a man
daddy is their sexual and emotional
labor society is preoccupied with women
who can transcend their birth in this
way think of Holly Golightly from
Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s Marilyn Monroe
blac Chyna Melania Trump who posed for
men&#39;s magazines in the 90s which comes
into the broader umbrella of sex work as
does all soft porn the knee-jerk
reaction the people often have to sex
couching and moral mumbling that it is
wrong it&#39;s to hide up with ideas of how
women should behave we are not meant to
financially capitalize on our sexuality
but instead give it freely and within
the bonds of a relationship this is why
men sex workers and not scrutinized in
nearly the same way as women sex workers
there is no discounting of their
autonomy or attempts to save them when
men sex workers are clamped down on it
is generally homophobic the bathhouse
raids of the 80s for example were more
concerned with the visibility of
homosexual sex than whether or not men
could consent to transactional sex women
sex workers are seen as passive victims
slaves the patriarchy people who
decisions have to be made for this is
how high-profile white actresses such as
Meryl Streep Lena Dunham Kate Winslet
and Hathaway and others can think it is
appropriate in 2015 to sign a petition
against Amnesty International&#39;s decision
to advocate for the rights of sex
workers blind criticism of sex workers
ironic especially coming from these
actresses as a few hundred years ago
actresses were viewed as sex workers
because of the way in which they steps
outside the private sphere allowed for
women into the public sphere and often
were sex workers - such as in the case
of nell gwyn the renowned actress and
mistress of charles ii i asked how come
faking intimacy in front of a camera is
fine but not between two consenting
adults i asked how come putting up with
an exploitative director is fine in the
name of art but my decision to work
under a brothel manager is not mine to
make how can these women look down from
their immense tower of wealth and
privilege and say how other women can or
cannot make money to survive casting
couch or brothel bed what is the
difference women used their body as an
individual beauty privilege in many
diverse ways to live in this
and I say use because it is important to
note that I do not sell my body I do not
power away at myself with each work
interaction until I&#39;m whittled away to
nothing at all
I&#39;m just as loving caring open and
independent as I ever was I&#39;m just as
much of a person as I ever was and if I
do rent out my vagina how is that any
different to a laborer renting out their
arms to stock shelves and athlete
renting out their body for public
entertainment a model renting out theirs
to sell products in 1917 at a US protest
of sex workers brothel madam Reggie
gamble said nearly every one of these
women is a mother or has someone
depending on her they driven into this
life by economic conditions you don&#39;t do
any good by attacking us why don&#39;t you
attack these conditions these words ring
true a hundred years later if people are
so concerned with how other people make
money to survive why don&#39;t we make
surviving easier for those who are most
marginalized why not the same passion
when it comes to public health care
being threatened racial discrimination
and workplaces cuts to public school
funding theoretical arguments can be
conducted above our heads but as
legislation and stigma that affects us
the swedish model which exists across a
number of countries and criminalizes the
buying of sex rather than the selling of
sex defines pimps as anyone who leaves
off the earnings of a sex worker in
execution this means that sex workers
can&#39;t work together for safety can&#39;t
screen clients can&#39;t rent a property
can&#39;t use their earnings to send their
children to university the system in the
UK this year saw a 70 year old brothel
cleaner charged with brothel keeping
after she attempted to save the life of
a man who collapsed there the system in
the US which uses condoms as evidence of
prostitution across an
of states such as California and New
York condemns many street based sex
workers to working without condoms for
fear of arrest and the assault that
comes at the hands of the police it also
completely ignores the fact that for
many sex workers this is their only
viable Avenue of income I am incredibly
lucky to work in a place where sex
workers decriminalized New South Wales
is one of only two places in the world
New Zealand is the other so my job is
subject to the same rules and
regulations as any other industry
unlike sex workers in the Republic of
Ireland I do not have to worry about
being raped by a policeman threatening
to arrest me
unlike sex workers in South Australia I
don&#39;t have to worry about being arrested
and having conviction on my record that
makes it even harder to exit the
industry
I can&#39;t donate blood I can&#39;t get work
cover
I can&#39;t travel to the US and I very
likely will come up against stigma when
looking for a job or a rental property
but I&#39;m incredibly lucky I could work to
support myself in safety I can seek
legal aid if something happens to me and
I can as a white woman speak about my
job without it being used as an argument
against my validity as a citizen of this
society or without being held up as an
example of my race both of which
happened to migrant women and women of
color because of my education people
often assume that I came to sex work out
of a desire to earn my own money to be
independent for my parents when in
reality I came to it because my single
unemployed parent could not support me
even though he wanted to in the
dichotomy presented in the media of
either clamorous high-flying escort or
drug-addicted downtrodden victim there
is little place for the myriad of
stories between I have worked with an
African immigrant who could not get
another job because English wasn&#39;t her
first language but was able to save up
enough through sex work to start her own
business and be financially independent
from any future partner I have a friend
whose mental illness does not allow her
to commit to normal contracted work but
can come and go and work whenever she is
able to with sex works flexible hours I
have worked with a woman stashing away
money after every shift so she could
save up enough money to leave her
abusive husband with her two children
get if she&#39;d gone to the Salvation Army
for help very likely the first thing
they would do is recommend that she
leaves sex work and put an end to her
only income these unending and moral
arguments around sex work distracts from
the real issue instead of having to
justify our humanity justify our
profession and prove our humanity we
should be included in the mainstream
feminist movement so what can you do to
incorporate sex workers into the general
fight for human rights remember that you
are the new generation a political
generation and it is you that will hold
sway and shape the future in the years
to come as client sex worker member of
society it is you who will affect how
sex workers are treated by birth
legislation and those around them watch
your language even a casual negative
comments such as she&#39;s dressed like a
whore to humanizes us watch her
assumptions just because a woman is a
migrant does not mean she&#39;s been
trafficked include them in feminist
discussions include them in discussions
about prep antiretroviral drugs used to
prevent HIV infection and national
health initiatives the slowing in the
spread of HIV in the 1990s is directly
and partly attributable to the
decriminalization of sex work in New
South Wales in 1995 donate to sex worker
rights orgs stand up for sex workers
when we were abused online but mainly
remember that we are not deserving of
Rights because we are respectable we are
deserving of Rights because we are human
thank you
