so yes my name is Jason I has been the
last few years working in virtual
reality just quick show of hands who&#39;s
heard of VR before who&#39;s tried it not
too bad not too bad so what are the
inherent problems of VR is it&#39;s a very
hard thing to articulate without trying
it I love VR in VR I&#39;m 6 foot 4 biceps
the size of Bournemouth I love it I
Barbie in VR as much as I can the
challenges for the are I think it&#39;s the
industry of the whole it&#39;s articulate
them to people where the value lies
outside of what you&#39;ve probably heard of
or seen on the adverts around gaming and
that kind of stuff so in my current role
with Dawn I spend a lot of time talking
to brands and what I talk to brand about
is where the true value of VR life today
so looking at VR as a tech where the
value lies who&#39;s using it and what for
because there&#39;s a lot of ambiguity in
the industry around what products look
like where the market is going to go and
actually taking away the ambiguity in
saying this is actually as a if you are
a brand or an organization because how
you can use VR to its true benefit now
so so so Jon just give you a quick bit
background we are one of the world&#39;s
leading producers and distributors of VR
content we&#39;ve worked in over 300
productions now a range of different
partners all sorts of wars we actually
won an Emmy last week for a piece of
content and basically over the last four
years we have film VR in pretty much
every scenario there is whether it&#39;s
underwater drones helicopters the whole
kind of piece and what excites me the
most about VR I think is that when
people say to me why is it what is it
about VR that gets you excited what is
it about VR that you think makes it
special and for me it&#39;s because this
quote I think when VR is done properly
VR can create a connection with the user
like no other media so if you take VRS
core strengths of immersing someone into
a situation what you can do is you can
forge a connection with that person it
just isn&#39;t possible in any other form of
media we all know we spent years
watching sixteen by nine films and TV
programs and over those over that time
we have become masters of that trade and
what we as
consumers we&#39;ve become masters of
consuming that content but actually with
VR allows you to engage with those users
in the completely different a new way
and what&#39;s exciting about that is that
when you do it right what you get from
putting someone in VR is an incredible
sense of presence so obviously if you
are watching this on on TV you kind of
see the environment around you you see
that your sauce is Everest but you don&#39;t
feel like you&#39;re there you know we
probably all seen images of Everest
before on TV in VR
you can play someone there on that
mountain if it&#39;s a particular example
you are there you&#39;re with the guide you
are looking around you have complete
freedom to explore that a world around
you so what it does is even though you
know you&#39;re in virtual reality it&#39;s
still powerful enough to trick your
brain into believing that you&#39;re there
and what that then does is elicit an
incredible sense of intimacy so the
minute you start injecting people into
this all of sudden what you get is that
feeling that actually that was an
experience you share with these people
an example here is a film we did with a
band in a tour bus now it&#39;s kind of
ghost this idea of the ticket you can&#39;t
buy normally if you were to go to a
concert you would stand there you would
see the band it&#39;s obviously a great
experience but you don&#39;t get this what
VR can do is place you somewhere that
you wouldn&#39;t normally go and in this
example you&#39;re watching the band play
and it feels like they&#39;re playing to you
we even did a film with Paul McCartney
and you&#39;re there in his private studio
as you do and he&#39;s there and he&#39;s
playing to you he&#39;s looking at you and
you feel like again even though you know
you&#39;re in VR you still feel like he&#39;s
there looking at you playing just for
you it&#39;s this kind of idea of a private
concert and when you put all that
together what you get is emotion and
that is an incredibly powerful thing for
any brand or organization this is an
example of a film we&#39;ve behind the
scenes and again because you&#39;re viewing
this content as if you&#39;re a fan when the
action takes place when it happens you
feel like you were there present in that
situation and your intimate those around
you and you&#39;re sharing the emotion of
that situation and as we know once you
unlock emotion in people all of a sudden
what can cook you can communicate to
them is so powerful because they are
there in a state of wanting to be
entertained by this content they&#39;re
there they&#39;re present they&#39;re aware and
actually what that means is that you can
tell stories and fundamentally if you
look at the hitch
three of any sort of media all it&#39;s been
used for TRADOC predominantly is to tell
stories and every single innovation in
storytelling every single innovation in
media has been a new more powerful way
of telling stories so if you and so if
you take for example the how we&#39;ve
transformed over the years from radio to
TV to PCs to to smartphones all of these
things fundamentally allowed people to
tell stories in new ways now there&#39;s
also a hundred of different types of
stories you can tell when it can be a
story about your brand or your
organization it can be it can be
anything but ultimately if you look at
the evolution for all of these every
single juncture I&#39;m not old enough to
remember some of these but at the time
there were people that would say oh I&#39;m
not sure I want to sit in front of a box
in my front room and watch some images
on a TV I&#39;m not sure I want to say air
box on my desktop and type away you know
I even remember when the first iPhone
came out people were saying I&#39;m not
really sure I&#39;m going to want to hold
something and tap on some glass I want
my keypad you know I want my blackberry
Keeper and actually if you look at the
VR industry now and people are saying do
I really want to wear a headset you&#39;re
gonna put headset on and sit there with
a headset on my head and look around and
I think actually we have to recognize it
the industry as a whole is pretty
embryonic it&#39;s still early days the
hardware is still kind of first gen but
if you think of how powerful it is now
even with first generation hardware
think about where that&#39;s going to be in
the future and bring in and what Rob was
talking about about AI there&#39;s a lot of
companies now that are even looking at
how you bring AI onto VR so you can be
in a situation and actually have
intelligence around you so you have that
sense of presence you had that sense of
emotion but you actually am interacting
with objects that have some intelligence
behind them and again I think for all of
this it&#39;s incredible how much more
capabilities these deliver to those
people that wanted to tell compelling
stories and we believe that VR is a huge
leap for that and I personally believe
that um there&#39;s a lot of different
versions that some of you guys may have
seen some of this stuff there&#39;s a lot of
different versions of this kind of stat
around how much we believe if we when we
remember when we see here and recommend
things I think for me what&#39;s true is
that when we feel like we actually
experience something we&#39;re much more
likely to remember that experience if we
feel like we were there if we feel
like if our brains feel like it was
something that we physically experienced
we are much more likely to recall that
to remember it and also to enjoy it so
if you look at the example of a lot of
work that&#39;s being done the moment in VR
training there are examples there where
people would normally sit in front of a
bit of paper and read or they might go
on a board and write some stuff down or
even be lectured to in VR you can put
someone in that situation so we&#39;re
working with a company that my friend
mature butch is working with and they
put together a training example for you
right Anna we&#39;re actually rather than do
the evacuation procedure on the actual
train itself or even in a lecture hall
what you can actually do is go there and
be in that train and do every step of
that evacuation in VR which basically
there means as a result you feel like
you did that yourself you&#39;ve been for
that train you&#39;ve done you&#39;ve done that
experience and therefore as a result of
that how much more you remember then you
would do otherwise is incredibly
powerful and as a result of that for
always being used across pretty much
every industry now in all sorts of
scenarios from there&#39;s even a company
doing crane training you can go there
have a headset on you can control the
crane I mean everything so it&#39;s so
exciting to see as a technology what its
enabling people to do and the people the
creatives who have the thought behind
what you can do with the technology
where it can go it&#39;s really really
exciting to see where the future where
the future will lie so I think one thing
that&#39;s really really exciting is that if
you look our everyday lives now we walk
down the street wherever we are turn on
the TV go on our phone we are bombarded
with marketing messages you know we it
is just a sea of deals and offers and
bright lights telling us to go in and
buy this and buy that and it was a
result of that what we really have is
noise we have all this noise around
people trying to tell us tell us stuff
plans trying to tell their stories
organizations trying to tell their
stories retailers trying to get you into
their stores and I think over time we&#39;ve
also come numb to all of this noise
that&#39;s around us as a brand as an
organization how on earth do you break
through that how do you get yourselves
noticed how do you get yourselves known
now I saw this this is there just a
thing I found on Google I think it&#39;s
even more now in a world where we see
about 5,000 pieces marketing a day again
as
Shuma how are we meant to remember that
how are we meant to as an advertiser how
are you meant to work out what is going
to appeal to a consumer what&#39;s going to
resonate you look at marketing now and
most of the first have all been done
people are trying to sell a stuff in an
in a manner of ways the beauty of VR is
that actually you don&#39;t have that
distraction we live in a world now when
people are on their phones constantly on
Twitter on Facebook we are looking at
advert off to add after advert we are
being trying to sold slippers and share
and all this kind of stuff right and I
think we all become so numb to this that
we are so engrained with our technology
obviously we know and we love our
smartphones I&#39;m not taking anything away
from that
but these days we are so glued to
technology we have it have around us
that I think we loo almost as as
consumers you almost become numb to the
meshes that are being portrayed to us
how much second screening goes on if
you&#39;re Sat if you&#39;re watching Netflix or
Amazon actually you&#39;re there you on your
phone at the same time you know my cakes
my kids and nagging me wife nagging me
you know there&#39;s I am so distracted in
that scenario and most of us are
probably speak for myself here but most
of us I think probably when it comes to
adverts on TV if we&#39;ve got sky well
fast-forward them anyway but we don&#39;t
read pay much attention the beauty of VR
is that when that headset is on you have
that person&#39;s undivided attention they
are there you have them for however long
you hunt right this guy here loving his
milkshake and he is loving whatever
experience is being presented to him
here the key message here really is that
when that headset is on that person if
it&#39;s a 2 3 4 minute experience you have
them they&#39;re not second screening
they&#39;re not looking around they&#39;re not
watching something else at the same time
they are there and actually the power of
that for a brand or an organization it&#39;s
huge and I think actually what part of
the challenge of VR is for brands to
work out with this bow what they do with
it how they make use of this power
because actually if you look at the VR
industry there&#39;s been a lot of content
as the market is growing a lot of
contents being crated that doesn&#39;t
really utilize the core strengths of
them of the medium when you take that
headset off it doesn&#39;t really give you a
lot there&#39;s no feeling as a result for
me the power of VR is that starting with
take when that person takes that headset
off how do you want them to feel what do
you want them to do what you want them
to say if I take the headset off and
they go okay that was a right I sort of
looked around a room for a bit and if
there&#39;s no outtake to it if it can be
done in 69 don&#39;t do it because
fundamentally you&#39;re not using the
strength or the platform what we are
allows you to do is put your brand put
your user put your consumer in the
middle of your brand and tell them a
story that is compelling in a way that
makes them remember your brand in a new
way you guys have probably seen this
kind of fabled millennial generation how
we don&#39;t want to be blatantly sold
products now we don&#39;t want to be say
here&#39;s a you know for example here&#39;s a
glass coca-cola buy it we don&#39;t want
that anymore what consumers want is to
be told a story by a brand and as a
result that brand equity changes based
on the experience you&#39;ve given them so a
great example is the Heineken I think
you ever seen the Heineken world
two-part film where it puts two people
in a room they&#39;ve told to construct a
bar together they then construct the bar
they sit down and they&#39;re shown in a
video that each of them has been has
been filmed with quite prejudiced views
about each other or about the type of
person that each other is and then as a
result of that they then asked whether
they want to stay and solve their
problems together or leave it&#39;s
incredibly powerful film incredibly
powerful and it tells the story in a way
in its Heineken saying it&#39;s not saying
we&#39;re Heineken look how cool we are
it&#39;s them telling a story and as a
result you feel differently about their
brand because they brought you that
story and at the end of the film they
share a Heineken and they discuss their
differences and in that film every
single person&#39;s chose to stay and
discuss their differences rather than
leave and I think that for me shows
where the future of storytelling is
going especially with brands and with VR
that is an incredible synergy because in
that world then you can tell those
stories in a manner that feels immersive
it makes the person feel emotion and as
a result feel differently about your
brand or organization and if you think
of it like we all know that in cinemas
that kind of gold spot that 60 seconds
before the main feature is one of the
most expensive pieces marketing you can
buy because that is the piece where
people are thought to be most attentive
you know you&#39;ve watched the 75 trial is
beforehand of films you&#39;re never going
to watch all the best bits of all those
films and then you watch a couple of
adverts and then you sit down the lights
go down the screen expands and
that&#39;s when you have their attention
with VR you have that all the time
they&#39;re there they have the headset on
they&#39;re ready for the message you&#39;re
going to to transmit to them the
challenge is how you make the most out
of that and make sure that it&#39;s
experience they want to recommend and
come back to and if you look at the VR
industry as a whole there is trillions
of dollars of market capital behind it
all of these companies Google Sony
oculus YouTube are investing millions
and millions in VR and they&#39;re doing it
because they realize that as a medium as
time goes on it will allow them and
their appetizers to tell their stories
in much more compelling ways that allow
the user to have genuinely unique
experiences and as a result of that
you&#39;re seeing some big brands already
leaning into VR so from McDonald&#39;s to
North Face to Marriott they&#39;re all
trying to work out how VR can add value
in their particular industry because in
a lot of circumstances there&#39;s not a lot
of innovation taking place with
marketing in this world so VR allows
them a new way to bring their stories to
life and this is an example of a brands
that we work with but again for brands
from a range of different industries
range of different environments and it
isn&#39;t a case of there&#39;s one particular I
always get asked you know what&#39;s the
low-hanging fruit what&#39;s the one
industry that you think they are working
and genuinely there isn&#39;t one it VR can
work anywhere it just needs the
creativity and thought behind it and the
halo effect for that is actually from
the research there&#39;s a from the people
that use VR there&#39;s a massively positive
effect so 60% of people forming a more
positive view of that brand seeing it&#39;s
for thinking I&#39;m more likely to buy
their products and even here I think
them it&#39;s the most powerful slide people
that try the offices from a Nielsen
study are 83 percent more likely to
enjoy that experience to be engaged with
it and also recall that brand and again
if you are a brand if you&#39;re an
advertiser that is incredibly you know
that what the possibilities that opens
are endless for a brand so but also one
of the key is making sure that as the
industry evolves that what we have is
distribution and allowing people to see
that content I think a lot of the
challenge in the industry at the moment
is even as a consumer if you want to go
and get into VR where do you start what
product you buy do you buy a mobile VR
headset you buy oculus rift do you buy
HTC vive and I think what&#39;s important
for the industry is to make sure that
whatever content is created is available
across all of these mediums so who
wants to try VR can try it regardless of
the platform they&#39;re on and I think that
will settle down is this kind of land
grab subsides over the next couple of
years so yeah so a range of different
opportunities are available for original
content to co-productions of IP holders
to pure branded content when players
such as The North Face Hellmann&#39;s lam
rover are all looking at saying we have
this great story to tell we have
innovation we have technology we have a
story behind who we are and what they&#39;re
all looking at doing is saying how do we
utilize VR how do we utilize its power
to make sure that we can tell that story
in a new way so I think you&#39;ll see how
the next couple of years more and more
brands more and more organizations
really looking at how they utilize the
true power of VR and also how they
harness the adoption that will come in
the marketplace ie people having VR
headsets in their houses and in their
homes how they utilize that to provide
benefits to their business so yeah so
the time is not tomorrow or later this
Google Image Search says it is now thank
you very much
