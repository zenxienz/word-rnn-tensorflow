so I&#39;ll begin with by saying I&#39;m here
for you today
I&#39;m here to make a difference hopefully
in your life I say that because I want
to when we talk about building bridges
bridges start with you the bridge starts
from your head to your heart to your
stomach to your feet can you think of
the idea that&#39;s going to change the
world do you have the emotion to be able
to deliver against it do you have a
taste and a palate for it that helps you
to stomach it day in and day out but
most important are you going to use your
feet to get it done so I say I love you
and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it
I say that and my wife is in the back
she said that&#39;s very provocative for a
group of women to say that but I say
that for for a particular reason I said
because I think the people that are
sitting in this room when your feet hit
the floor in the morning you&#39;re excited
about changing the world one place one
space at a time so the space that we
serve in and this is the space that we
serve in when you walk through it you&#39;re
better in that space is better because
you&#39;re being all that you can be so
again my goal today is helping you to be
all that you can be so therefore I say
again I love you and there&#39;s nothing you
can do about it but with that being said
it&#39;s going to take all of you to show up
to be able to make it happen and to be
able to do that every great leader has
gone through a watershed moment every
great leader has gone through a crucible
that crucible we sometimes run from the
thing I would say is embrace the
crucible because that crucible helps you
to be the best you that you possibly can
be that crucible takes you to another
level again building bridges you see as
a child I grew up running I grew up
sprinting I grew up sprinting through
life I did it for two particular reasons
one because I was good at it
I had world-class speed it took me to
college took me the university opened
doors that I thought would never be open
gave me opportunity
gave me a wart and reward for being fast
but the second reason that I was
sprinting because I wanted that success
I wanted to achieve success like my
father had achieved like my mother had
achieved and so I looked at them as role
models and said this is what I want but
when I want it I want it at 40 I I can&#39;t
wait I need to have that success at 40
and you asked why the why is my father
passed when he was 42 so think about the
burden on a ten-year-old child of a
father that has success and at 42
passing away from exhaustion taking care
of six kids with three jobs that&#39;s what
the burden that was placed on my
shoulder so sometime we put burns on our
shoulders that are unnecessary so I had
to have success by 40 by 40 I
accomplished a lot but I accomplished
nothing because I sprinted from place to
place trying to get this thing they call
success but for you the thing I would
come back in and say is success it&#39;s not
a destination but a journey so let&#39;s
enjoy the journey as we take the journey
of what we&#39;re calling life and building
these bridges are you enjoying the
journey are you making a difference in
the space that you&#39;re serving
I had a life coaching and she told me
she said you know the - is living you
you&#39;re not living the - and you&#39;re going
well what is the - see that - is
something that we all have in common you
may not realize it and it&#39;s kind of
morbid to say it but there&#39;s a time of
year that will say born this day pass
this day in the middle there&#39;s a - that
- is going to define the legacy that we
have and that we&#39;re going to live - are
we living to the legacy are we living
the - and living our particular legacy
with that being said the life coach said
James you need to slow down your path
you may not be able to tell it but I am
way past 40 now you may not be able to
see it on the face what you can&#39;t tell
I&#39;m Way past 40 being past 40 she said
you need to slow down and there are five
events log this is the best that I need
you to participate in that that will
slow you down physically maybe not slow
you down from a speed standpoint but
from
basically it will slow you down and the
two things I want you to get out of this
running these races the two things I
want you to finish and I want you to
allow your senses to come to life those
five senses to come to life so I went
through the first for the 3k the five to
the 5k 10k to half marathon did very
good in it finished it but my senses
were horrible I felt the blisters that
were on my feet the aches and pains that
was there were in my body the stars that
were floating around my head I saw
nothing I didn&#39;t even want to get up out
of bed after running these particular
races so I couldn&#39;t tick the box of Wow
in his senses to come to life the only
race I had left was a marathon so my
story around the crucible moment and
helping you to build the bridge is this
marathon so I started on the marathon
and at the beginning that began with
trouble to begin with see what they
didn&#39;t tell me is I would be running
with thirty five thousand of my closest
friends they didn&#39;t tell me that the
start line wasn&#39;t the start line we had
to start a mile and a half back before
we got to the start line and so
therefore I would say to you first
recognizing your life where&#39;s your start
line is your start line where it needs
to be because you can&#39;t get to the
finish line
unless you understand what the start
line is and also understand the
environment that you serve in and
because I was serving with 35,000 other
people I couldn&#39;t find my pace I
couldn&#39;t find my stride so by mile 10 I
was completely exhausted have you ever
been exhausted in your life where you
said I&#39;m giving up it doesn&#39;t make a
difference here I decided that I would
go to mile 17 you acts while mile 17 and
when I write my memoirs I&#39;ll have a
chapter that says mile 17 when I got to
mile 17 my wife and I had made an
agreement she would meet me at Mile 5
she would meet me at mile tennis she
would meet me at mile 17 and she met me
at mile 17 and I had made up in my mind
that a mile 17 I was done I couldn&#39;t
finish I was mentally exhausted
physically exhausted hams were torn up
my mind where I was physically and
mentally just distraught and couldn&#39;t
get to the place where I needed to be so
we were going to grab hands kiss and
walk off and go home and enjoy a nice
bottle of wine
she saw me and she saw that I was
distraught when I got to mile 17 she
said here&#39;s some Gatorade you need to
hydrate she said you got too many
clothes on take the shirt off this under
you and put the shirt back on and I said
you know I&#39;m really ready to go let&#39;s
let&#39;s go head to the car she looked at
me gave me a kiss looked at me and I and
said I&#39;ll see you at the finish and
after I said a few choice words about
her I had to make a decision on what it
is that I would needed to do and for you
this is what I would challenge you to
think about when you get to the crucible
moment first recognize that you&#39;re at
the crucible moment because you can&#39;t
solve it until you recognize that you&#39;re
sitting in the middle of it you can&#39;t
get out of a job an addiction a bad
relationship until you really realize
I&#39;m in this particular crew scible
moment be present in the crucible moment
because again it makes you a better
person it helps you to be laser-focused
on delivering against what your legacy
is going to be the second part is in
your resilience it takes resilience to
get you where you need to be you see I
have prepared over 150 miles that I had
run for this 24.6 mile race I had a
personal coach that taught me how to
hydrate I had a personal nutrition that
taught me what I should be eating and
for six months I trained to get through
this marathon and here I was suffering
at Mile 17 so have resilience through
the crucible moment that you&#39;re at and
then to the feet respond for every
action there&#39;s a reaction what&#39;s your
reaction is the defeat retreat or did to
go forward you have to make that
decision after my wife walked off I
decided to take one step towards the
finish line you see that one step
towards the finish line wasn&#39;t me in my
mind saying I&#39;m going from mile 17 to my
low 26
it was just saying take one step towards
it I took one step again towards that
finish line and I decided that it&#39;s time
to get up it&#39;s time to move to making
sure that I can cross the finish line
and then something happened and that&#39;s
the second part of what that coaches
said this census came alive I began to
see I hear birds chirping in the
background that I&#39;d never heard before
and a crowd cheering I was able to taste
the air go
to my lungs my feet were walking on
clouds and like I wasn&#39;t even moving and
the next thing I did I looked up and I
was crossing the finish line because I
became in the zone have you ever been in
the zone when you get things done you
don&#39;t know how you did it
I crossed the finish line and my life
has never been the same so I say to you
if you want to make a different this is
a great thing that&#39;s it in this venue
and have all the great people sitting
around you hear great speeches but if
you really want to make a difference
understand and recognize that you&#39;re in
the crucible moment understand and be
resilient through because your life
lenses have allowed you to be successful
in driving you through that you&#39;ve been
set up to succeed and the last piece of
this respond put one foot in front of
another go towards the finish line and
achieve the great success that you would
want to have with that being said I&#39;ll
see you at the top I&#39;ll see you at the
finish line but most important I love
you and there&#39;s nothing you can do about
it
[Applause]
