what I want to do today is talk about
two things sort of you know what the
title is you know what I learned as a
space cadet I&#39;ve considered myself the
space cadet and I wanted to talk about
how I arrived at where I met today and
have some tools two techniques which you
might find useful in your own careers
and then I want to talk about space
because I&#39;m a huge space buff I love
space everything about space and I think
we&#39;ve just begun to enter what I
consider to be the true business of
space I mean before was a space race now
it&#39;s a space collaboration and so those
are the two things that I that I wanted
to touch upon today so first a little
bit of background
most of my peer group got interested in
space via the Apollo program the program
that was spent a significant fraction of
the nation&#39;s gep United States to put
humans in the moon it was a very clear
deadline a very clear mandate by
President Kennedy man moon decade and
that towards the 19th 1960s the first
launches occurred and the teacher would
wheel in this old black-and-white TV set
into the classroom and we&#39;d all sit
there and we would watch the launch and
that just caught my imagination that was
it for me the the the next launch we
didn&#39;t have TV sets in every classroom
so our classroom didn&#39;t get that get the
watch launch so I pretended to be sick I
went into our bathroom and took a
thermometer and a match and I put the
match ether thermometer and exploded so
that was the beginning of my experience
in combustion sciences my mom took pity
on me let me stay home anyways and I sat
on my couch upside down like the
astronauts did the countdown 5 4 3 2 1
blast-off and watched another launch I
wrote to NASA and you see on the right a
picture that I got from NASA in this
packet unfortunate that&#39;s the only
picture I have left but I&#39;ve kept that
picture ever since it&#39;s a grainy photo
it&#39;s it&#39;s authentic it&#39;s one of my most
cherished possessions and so that&#39;s
that&#39;s how I really got interested in
this field called space at at that point
time I started as I got older could
you do experience and experiment in
combustion sciences I mean what little
kid would love to have a little model
rocket with a with an engine that
actually you know spontaneously could
bus in a controlled fashion you can see
here some some of the markets I still
have it&#39;s interesting enough I still
keep these they&#39;re kind of beat up the
kind of warrant I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re
flight worthy anymore I think the
quality control is probably out of them
but I still keep them just because
they&#39;re mementos of my childhood and and
what I was drawn to when when I entered
this fuel of space I&#39;ve decided to go to
when it&#39;s go to college I thought about
what I want to do and I want to be an
astronaut
unfortunately these my glasses
prohibited me from doing that and so a
good buddy of mine said hey well if you
can&#39;t fly them when you design them and
so that&#39;s when I said you know what I&#39;ll
think I&#39;ll do that so I went to school
got a nervous engineering degree got a
master&#39;s in system engineering and I
built salads salads on the Left I build
all kinds of salads I worked on GPS I
worked on communication satellites I
worked on the remote sensing satellites
that bring you Google Earth I worked on
the very first Rovers that went to Mars
so it&#39;s kind of cool to be able to say I
have Hardware on another planet and that
worked on a lot of science missions and
and then eventually I went from
engineering to program management from
program management to a P&amp;L
responsibility where I actually managed
launch vehicle so I actually managed the
vehicle that took those salads in the
space and and there&#39;s a phrase we use
and that is without lift there is no
space the cells are cool looking in my
opinion but they do you know good when
they sit in the high bay that of the
factories so you need to have lift and
that&#39;s where I want to talk about in a
few minutes where a lot of the
entrepreneurial ISM is occurring is in
the left field but but I didn&#39;t want to
tell you about my background in the
sense of trying to say here&#39;s my family
photos and here&#39;s my pet dog
but to give you some ideas of what I
learned in the course of 30-plus years
which is all about being resilient so so
what is resiliency well resiliency is
the ability to recover quickly from
difficulties now career resiliency is
just adjusting to career change to adapt
to market demands so your markets going
to change whatever field you choose I
can guarantee you and I think it&#39;s true
for everybody in this room you&#39;ve
entered into a market
and it changed over over time either you
became less interested in that market or
you didn&#39;t like the job you&#39;re doing or
maybe it was the environment that you&#39;re
in or maybe you&#39;re commuting too much
but there&#39;s always one aspect of any
career that says wow it&#39;d be perfect if
I could change this or be perfect if I
got more responsibilities for example I
was young I was a young system engineer
at Rockwell our national and I wanted to
be a lead and I remember going to my
uncle who was a very successful
businessman and he said well how old are
you Robert I got 27 years old sir it was
like what person the right mind would
give a 27 year old that kind of
responsibility and he was absolutely
correct we&#39;re talking hundreds of
millions of dollars with you know
invested to build that Sally and so what
I learned was that as you are faced
these obstacles as you face these
challenges you need to pivot and that&#39;s
the word you&#39;re going to hear a couple
times today and I pivoted from
engineering to program management to to
what I&#39;m doing now which is I just quit
a fortune 50 company to do a startup
I hope it&#39;s successful we&#39;re going to
give it all we got but it was something
that I chose to do and I&#39;ll tell you
some techniques that we learned to do
that and the first technique is defining
what&#39;s important to you it&#39;s really
important to do this it&#39;s really
important to write down the list of
things and this is a list I wrote about
my mid-career about 17 years ago I wrote
this list and it&#39;s still valid today and
you could think about these and your
list may be different that&#39;s okay but
you want to be able to say what are the
things are important now the unfortunate
thing with this list is you look at it
you say well I want at all you know I
want everything but the fact is some
things are more important than other
things so so how do you determine what&#39;s
more important well technically and and
you know you probably thought as an
engineer I wouldn&#39;t be presenting a
matrix to it but I&#39;m sorry to say that
I&#39;m gonna do some matrix manipulation
today so what you do is it&#39;s a technique
called the analytical hierarchical
process HB simply put you just do a
pairwise comparison between item a and
item B is item a less important of equal
importance or greater importance and I
just fictitiously filled this this chart
out so you can go anywhere from well you
know negative five to a positive five or
you know fractions it&#39;s different ways
of doing it and and you can see when I
did this list just sort of fictitional
e2 items came out on top
work-life balance and career
satisfaction the other ones not that
important you know I mean they&#39;re still
pretty high 17 percent I&#39;m not going to
discount but that&#39;s not that important
earlier in my career when we made the
move from Southern California in
Northern California the dot bomb
occurred you know which is you know when
the when the the market collapsed career
stability was very important to me I
needed I had three young kids the first
one about to go to college
two more behind it we had house payments
we had also demands we want to take
vacations we wanted new cars over a
couple years and so stability was very
important I did this last year stability
did become much less important which
allowed me to trash lies and to justify
moving from a fortune 50 company to the
startup and so this was something that
would advise you to do if you to choose
this technique I would advise you to do
it over time you do it a couple of times
by the way you didn&#39;t have to be on
career my wife and I did this when we
were choosing a home so where do we want
to live at in the barrier we put
together our list
you know proximity schools safety and so
forth so you can do this kind of
technique and a lot of other things just
not your career it&#39;s not limited to your
career once you have that list and you
know kind of what&#39;s important then you
can start thinking about a career that&#39;s
that you would find rewarding that could
maximize the benefit but then the
question becomes okay I know what career
I want to go into now but I don&#39;t know
where I want to be in that field say you
choose a field in banking or you choose
a field in real estate how do you know
where you want to be well this is a
second technique I used was was just a
visualization now I wish there&#39;s a
software program like Waze that allows
you to navigate to your endpoint sadly
there is no such thing it just doesn&#39;t
exist but it would be very cool wouldn&#39;t
it maybe something can start one up from
the catskill you know as soon as they
graduate here and so the idea here is
very simple you pick a future state and
a future time say you want to be a CEO
at age 60 you know make it up whatever
works for you write down the attributes
now this is where the LinkedIn program
comes in great handy because you can
look up at LinkedIn you could read
people&#39;s BIOS you can connect with them
you can ask them about hey what are the
things that you need to do in your
career and they&#39;ll give you those
attributes and and everybody&#39;s
CV is going to be different some people
can emphasize you know the financials or
maybe strategy or maybe product
management it&#39;s going to vary so maybe
there&#39;s a couple axes in a couple of
attributes and then you cut it in half
and you cut it in half again and you ask
yourself are you getting the attributes
you need to get to that future stay if
you are great stay when what you&#39;re
doing deal with it maybe it&#39;s there&#39;s
something about that job that you don&#39;t
like but if you always can get presented
an opportunity and it&#39;s not any of these
attributes on your you might want to
think about that&#39;s not what you know
maybe don&#39;t take that opportunity so
again it&#39;s not perfect it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
ideal but this is what I&#39;ve used started
about 17 years ago and it&#39;s been useful
to me
to get to there so at this point now I
want to pivot to to space and you know
the field that I&#39;m most passionate about
and so the first thing is I just want to
talk about the numbers so how big is it
that&#39;s pretty big 260 billion dollars as
of 2016 these numbers just came out a
couple months ago you can see the cater
you can see the market segments it&#39;s
predominated by the services industry
which makes sense because space is
freaking Mordor it&#39;s infrastructure if
the means to provide a capability to
people on the earth just like Stephen
Hawking they want to get science back
you got to build the satellite to get
there you got some engineering
challenges to get that sell a bill but
but the value proposition is to bring
the science return bring the science
back they actually call that science
return believe it or not and and it&#39;s
really there to only use right now the
sellers that are there now only using
one of the properties that space
provides and that property is
perspective and that&#39;s what gives you
the high-resolution imagery you see on
the left or the ability could connect
homes together or business together or
GPS every satellite up there is using
perspective there are two other
properties I&#39;ll talk about in a minute
that aren&#39;t being used so think about
that 260 billion dollars only two
properties the one the left I love
that&#39;s a picture of a human cargo
trafficking activity taking place in the
Asia Pacific or a digital globe a couple
D in Longmont Colorado was able to image
this ship leaving port and they were
able to track it they notified the
authorities the authorities went there
they free
human cargo what a great story I mean
what a wonderful story and this whole
segment is referred to as advanced
industries in advanced industry you can
see the footnote down there it&#39;s
basically a lot of IR ad is being spent
and a lot of a lot of people with high
degrees in it and there&#39;s about fourteen
advanced industries in the world if you
look at Brookings Institute and McKenzie
did a study which I participated on a
few years ago so you have an advanced
industry and this is why a lot of new
nations are looking at space and trying
to get involved in space which is
fantastic because more investment comes
in it&#39;s going to raise the level of
humanity such that I think I agree with
what Stephen Hawking said which was
eventually we&#39;re either gonna have to
figure out how to do better with our
energy on the planet but inevitably
we&#39;re going to figure out how to get off
the planet that&#39;s what&#39;s called a type 1
planet if you believe in the future ISM
and so forth so that&#39;s that&#39;s the
business as it is today and here&#39;s the
best part we&#39;re about to move into the
consumerization space you might have
heard the phrase democratization I love
that word because it says that no longer
is the purview of a few countries and
now every country can use it but
consumerization to me is more apt
because it&#39;s really where mainframes
were and the 80s to what your iPhone is
today so on the left you see a mainframe
and obviously that was the main computer
today it&#39;s your iPhone your iPhone is
your computer you don&#39;t need a computer
anymore these things on the right are
called cube sets there are 10
centimeters by 10 centimeters by 10
centimeters and this one&#39;s got a couple
them together so this is maybe a 30
centimeter by 10 by 10 these are
relatively inexpensive about $50,000
which I know it&#39;s expensive but compared
to you know a billion-dollar satellite
it&#39;s a bargain trust me and you could
put these up there&#39;s a company called
planet labs in San Francisco who built
200 these last year launch and they&#39;re
called doves and they&#39;re up there to
provide remote sensing you know
real-time community remote sensing of
the earth and so you can put all kinds
of missions on now you&#39;ve lowered the
barrier to entry and you&#39;ve created an
avenue to enter space which didn&#39;t exist
five years ago and as a result of that
you you&#39;re seeing a new tremendous
amount of venture capital going into the
market up until 2015 about 15 billion
dollars were invested in space in 2017
this year alone Softbank the Japanese
company committed 1.7 billion dollars to
Greg Wilders company oneweb which is
going to put up three or four thousand
salads to provide high-speed
connectivity 30 megabits per second at
$15 a month take a little suitcase you
throw in your roof it automatically
finds the satellites tracks it that&#39;s
his business model it&#39;s that&#39;s all about
access and and so that&#39;s where these
small salads come and they&#39;re going to
mass produce salads up until these cells
are built the biggest constellation of
salads ever built was iridium at 77 so
you think about that you know one also
talked about buildings earlier you know
these are one-off salads for the most
part you know Saudis have so 3000-4000
that&#39;s mass production when it comes to
spacecraft which is incredible and then
if you think about this projected
forward and you say well okay that&#39;s
good I could get that that&#39;s kind of
neat it&#39;s still kind of expensive but
you know what about the next five or 15
or 25 years you&#39;re not a futurist but it
doesn&#39;t take much of an imagination to
look out in the future I mean we&#39;ve got
for example robotics on the left is a
Canada arm built by the Canadians for
the Space Shuttle and it was a six
degree of freedom arm that went out and
grabbed satellites and deployed them and
so forth
of course you&#39;ve all familiar with the
Rovers that go on Mars those are 100%
robotics 20-minute speed light change
you can never remotely control that it&#39;s
all about artificial intelligence it&#39;s
all about deep machine learning before
those phrases were ever coined the
picture on the right there&#39;s a program
by DARPA to put up a satellite that&#39;s
got all these in defectors which are
basically tool belts it&#39;s a tool belt a
bunch of tools to do things from
repairing satellites refueling
satellites fixing satellites and then
there are some concepts of you&#39;re
pulling out antennas and other things to
make these cells more capable so think
about that project out 10 years with the
advance of with all this venture capital
money going into it it doesn&#39;t take much
to think well so we could do a lot more
maybe we could put a factory to space so
I&#39;ve mentioned earlier there&#39;s there&#39;s
we&#39;re using or exploiting only the one
value that space has today which is its
perspective space is two of the values
it has the microgravity perfect spheres
right which is very important for things
like drug delivery systems and vacuum
properties you know it&#39;s got a 10 to
minus twelfth Torr vacuum of space which
becomes important for silicon so you can
lay down silicon one cell at a time and
have ultra pure silicon you know
surpassing Moore&#39;s laws Moore&#39;s law in
terms of of what the chips can do today
so right now the economics aren&#39;t there
I don&#39;t know when they will be there
that&#39;s a good business case another
business case for the category but
eventually you know you can imagine that
these other properties these other
capabilities will be in space to a
certain degree and then obviously you
know building human sustainable human
cargos and then ships of that nature
into space for that 260 billion dollar
number I saw that you saw earlier you
could travel it you could quadruple it
again I don&#39;t know the time I&#39;m the one
set next to an economist who said you
always quote a number but never a date
so I&#39;ll say it&#39;s going to quadruple at
some point but I want to give you the
day but that&#39;s that&#39;s that to me is
really really nice and it needs every
discipline lawyers regulatory engineers
scientists program managers it needs
every discipline you can imagine out
there so this is a again back to the
advanced industry this is a really neat
advanced industry so the final slide I
have is kind of this this perspective of
the thing we call earth and you think
about that you look at that and thank
you for the deep breathing treatments
earlier dr. I really appreciate it
really helped me calm and when I look at
this picture I get the same sensation
like my heartbeat goes down my stress
level drops you don&#39;t see borders you
don&#39;t see terrorism you don&#39;t see
political strife you don&#39;t see any
issues you don&#39;t see of course you don&#39;t
see famine and other things that are on
this planet of ours but what you see is
a planet with a very very thin
atmosphere and that&#39;s the only thing
that&#39;s holding us together that&#39;s the
only thing that&#39;s creating this thing we
call life and so when we look at the
space station and here&#39;s an interesting
fact for you if you were born after
November 2nd of 2000 he moans will have
been in space your entire life you think
about that for a minute November 2nd
2000 humans will have been in
base your entire life I can&#39;t say that
there&#39;s been periods were right there
were no humans in space but there were
periods were there were humans in space
but Pumas are here to stay in spaces
with is what all argue and and when
you&#39;re in space right now the space
station has all kinds of nationalities
they&#39;ve had Russians they&#39;ve had Chinese
Americans Europeans Malaysians Japanese
other countries you have to work
together it&#39;s all about you working
together so space could be a unifier now
I have to give credit where credit&#39;s due
I was a bit nervous about this too
professor Hawking gave a a speech when
Sir Richard Branson unveiled his
spaceship to and the Mojave Desert
earlier this year I was fortunate enough
to be invited down there and Sir Richard
Branson played this video from Professor
Hawking and professor Hawking actually
coined the phrase space could be unifier
and as a result when you look at
spaceship 2 it&#39;s now called
unity which i think is just brew it so
that&#39;s my conclusion I hope you enjoyed
it and space is a place to be thank you
[Applause]
