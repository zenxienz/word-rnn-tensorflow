well kalimera first of all I&#39;d like to
thank Nicky and the organizers for
giving me the honor to open this
incredible event thank you so much
well what you have just seen is the
first trailer of have a new film which
is called woman but let me introduce
myself first I have been making
documentaries for many years now mostly
focused on social topics whether it
would be organ trafficking immigration
or poverty and one day a famous French
photographer and director young artist
Burton called me and said you know I&#39;m
preparing a film which will make a
revolution in documentary industry it
will look like nothing that you have
already seen and I thought yeah yeah
well this man is crazy
but at the same time I was curious and
so I came to see him and I asked to see
the scenario and I still remember he
showed me this one piece of paper and on
that paper it was written well it is a
firm that will focus on women and human
stories will go all around the world to
try to understand what is it to be a
human on this earth today and I am that
in a way it explains you know how we
human share things together and what
other things the Teresa parts and at the
end I remember it ended with a beautiful
sentence it said only love can save the
world and so I said wow this is amazing
the idea is incredible but I mean can I
see the scenario and he said no there is
no scenario what will happen is that we
will go everywhere in the world and will
interview 2,000 people and the people
will make the story of this film
we&#39;ll build the story around their
testimonies and at that point I really
thought he was crazy and so to be honest
I also thought that it will never work
and I have to tell you that I was wrong
because four years later well this film
was released and it has been seen by
more than 60 million people from all
around the world and you can watch it
online for free it is called human and
you go on YouTube and you just type
human the movie and what really struck
me while we were filming the interviews
for this film is the difference in the
perspective between men and women
women&#39;s perspective wasn&#39;t better or
worse than man it was just different you
know where&#39;s man you know while men
would be very proud and very happy to
talk about their achievements which is
great women would have difficulties even
to use the I sentence they would always
prefer to say we us and I was like you
know there is no one in the picture only
you talk about yourself but now they
would always put their children their
family their community first and at the
same time a thing that really amazed me
was like the need for women to talk if
we would go to any even the most remote
area in Bangladesh with find women who
would come to us and say you know I know
you&#39;re doing this film and I want to be
part of it I want to share my story and
this is a completely different situation
from what it was let&#39;s say even 10 years
ago because 10 years ago we had to go
and search for women to convince them
and most of them were really frightened
and you know it was difficult and I can
understand but with human I realized
that the situation has changed and all
over the world there are more and more
women who don&#39;t want to wait for change
coming from outside
they want to see the change now and they
want to be part of that change you can
see it in Iran let&#39;s say where women
can&#39;t sink in public and however there
are women who do that you can see it in
Saudi Arabia where until several days
ago women were not allowed to drive but
there were always women who would dare
to do that and see just several days ago
the King finally allowed them you know
to drive Wow incredible so things are
changing for the better and even though
there are also countries where things
are regressing with my co-director Yong
we thought we would be with luck to be
part of that positive change and how we
do that by giving women a voice and this
is how this project woman started and
well you you may wonder so what&#39;s so
important about you know giving women a
voice and still we are talking here
about you know making better selves from
who we are and well I&#39;m sure that you
have seen it in our trailer there&#39;s an
interesting fact countries where that
have achill achieved the you know better
gender equality are also countries with
the highest ranks of happiness and I
truly believe there is a link between
these two numbers by the way here in
Greece you are on the 89th rank for the
Happiness index and on the 87th as far
as the gender equality is concerned you
see that there is really a correlation
between the two numbers and there is
also a lot of work still to do because
well even ten years ago the situation
here was different and you were on the
69th place so you&#39;ve you know you lost
20 places just in ten years and I think
the economic crisis has something to do
with it
it hits women even harder the man so
these is
these other topics would like to talk
about in the firm and so we&#39;ve started
we go to interview women starting from
Michelle Obama and to any girl woman
lady who is here in this room and we try
to know their story and to give them a
voice and it&#39;s incredible because what
really struck me since and surprised me
since we started is that the worst enemy
we women have is not the one I thought
it was obviously man well there are a
few of them in the room are there some
of them are fighting really hard you
know to make the change for the better
some of them are fighting really hard
not to see any change but most of them
are not doing much at all and I mean I
can understand that it has been like
that for years for thousands of years so
why would you bother since you know
you&#39;re born it was already been like
that so why would you do something you
didn&#39;t you know provoke that situation
so yeah I understand but the worst enemy
we women have well often are other women
and it&#39;s not my opinion it&#39;s what I&#39;ve
heard from hundreds of women around the
world and I&#39;ve heard it from women in
politics
I&#39;ve heard it on women on the head of
great corporations attack in all kinds
of fields a lot of them told me that in
their career they have faced more you
know jealousy and problems with other
women then with man interesting you see
and well when you think about it I can
understand I mean for thousands of years
there were actually almost no women in
those positions of power so when you
finally after a lot of struggle get to
the top well when there is another one
you obviously think there is only place
for one so yourself so you don&#39;t see her
as a friend you see her at threats and
so I&#39;ve heard it from women on the top
but I&#39;ve also heard it from women on the
bottom I just came back from Turkey and
while I&#39;ll share
Astoria with you a woman told me you
know that she was forced to marriage
when she was young then she experienced
violence with her husband then she
experienced a lot of abuse with a family
in law and once she finally got a son
who became adult and who married the
same woman have suffered so much became
a horrible mother-in-law for this young
girl It was as if she was you know
taking revenge for everything she has
been through so for so so many years but
she was not doing it against her
husband&#39;s against her family in law no
she was doing it against another
innocent woman and I mean girls woman we
need to change this we need to change
this mindset because I mean we have half
of the population
think about it and if only millions of
our voices finally start to sound as one
imagine what we could do imagine because
on the other head what really impresses
me every time I travel is the strength
women have and I&#39;m not talking about you
know the physical strength here I&#39;m
talking about something you can&#39;t see
with naked eye and inner strength most
of the women have inside it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s
like as if despite the violence it&#39;s
discrimination then you know the problem
daily routine that we all have women
never give up they always stand still on
their faith and they continue and quite
often they don&#39;t even do it for
themselves they do it for their children
and they do it for their family and
there is an interview that I really you
know turned me upside down which shows
this inner strength I&#39;m talking about
I&#39;d like to share with you right now I
have done so many things in my life that
I consider very difficult I&#39;ve climbed
difficult moans I ran across deserts
you know I&#39;ve swim 122 miles in the
ocean but standing up and saying I&#39;m a
survivor of sexual violence and human
traffic and for the first time was the
most difficult thing I&#39;ve ever done
because saying it makes it a more real
saying aloud I can take it back by
denying it I just hope that if I tonight
enough it&#39;s one day it&#39;s gonna turn out
that wasn&#39;t true there was a dream
this incredible woman is Norma Bastidas
and well when she was 12 she was abused
by her grandfather and it lasted four
years when she finally became a teenager
was 17 she was offered a contract to
become a model and to go abroad and so
she wanted you know to go away from this
life so she accepted and she found
herself in a horrible you know sexual
trafficking Network and so to have her
passport back she had to become a
prostitute for years when she finally
got back to her country she moved from
Mexico to Canada and she started to you
know a new life she married she had a
child and one day doctors told her that
her son was becoming blind he had
exactly the same disease that her
grandfather had the one who had abused
her for years
so at that point she thought okay life
is really against me there is no way out
and she started drinking and I can
understand and so she became a drunk one
night because she most did you know
drink during night time when she wanted
to reach out for the bottle well she
thought about her son
and she saw that well I&#39;m not here alone
anymore I have to fight for him and
instead of you know reaching out for the
bottle she put her sneakers on and she
went for a run and each night when she
wanted to drink she would do that and
she started to run marathons and then
ultramarathons and then this woman well
she completely amazing she did the
longest three Atlin in the world she&#39;s
even in the Guinness World Book for that
so can you imagine this is the inner
strength I&#39;m talking about and obviously
not all of the stories we women have are
so amazing but almost all of us have
this inner strength inside and just
imagine what we could do if we became
conscious of that and if we just would
release it and man here in this room
just imagine what could happen if you&#39;d
help us women release that ranks Wow
and also I mean we&#39;ve taught the man&#39;s
way for thousands of years and it wasn&#39;t
that bad
but I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re completely happy
with where it got us
so why why not try something else
why well I&#39;d like to finish with another
incredible woman I&#39;ve interviewed she&#39;s
from a pastoral community in Kenya and
she has a message for all of us right
now even if you have not gone to school
make sure that we men have opened their
eyes they know what is going around
people are talking of women right Yuma
right child right they hear in our
language we do we call them for for
seminars so if you are not aware one of
you one of me is aware of the enumerate
the child right the violence against
women I handed now for the wonder you
have not gone to school whether you have
gone to school people have I yes they
have taken something in so I think from
now the women will fight for their right
and I am one of them
[Applause]
well I won&#39;t tell you what to do I won&#39;t
give you any lesson just to conclude
after a woman like that what can I say
I&#39;d like to finish with a quote from one
of the strongest interviews with dance
or human it was a little boy 12 years
old who lives in the streets of Kinshasa
in Congo you know he was rejected by his
family he&#39;s all by himself and when he
asked him what&#39;s the meaning of your
life he told us we all have a mission I
just didn&#39;t find yet what mine is well
once this incredible day is finished and
you go back to your daily routine just
stop for a minute and think about that
what&#39;s your mission to make this world a
better place thank you

[Applause]
