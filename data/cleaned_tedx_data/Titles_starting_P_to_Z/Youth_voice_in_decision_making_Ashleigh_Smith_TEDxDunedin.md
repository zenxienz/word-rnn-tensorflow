I never really know how to start these
things so today I thought this be a
little bit different and we&#39;ll start
with a riddle now if you know the answer
I wouldn&#39;t either shout it out to me but
be warned I&#39;ve got very high
expectations that all of you should know
what it is and if you don&#39;t I&#39;m gonna
seriously suggest you go back and relive
your childhood because you&#39;ve seriously
missed out here goes who lives in a
pineapple under the sea here&#39;s a great
SpongeBob SquarePants
now I know what you&#39;re thinking I&#39;ve
come to this TEDx event and this checks
opening line is from the SpongeBob
SquarePants theme song but also maybe
this is gonna be a little more
interesting than what I first thought so
what does spongebob have to do with
young people sir there&#39;s second line of
a theme song that gives us a little bit
more of a clue absorbent and yellow and
porous as hey why is spongebob absorbent
yellow and porous it&#39;s sponge still does
answer your question though does it well
the way that society views spongebob and
the way that society views young people
can often be one in the same and today
I&#39;m gonna tell you why now before I go
into the depths of my very extensive
research on the correlation between how
society views spongebob and how society
views young people
I just like to take this opportunity to
reassure you all this is completely
legit talking peer-reviewed published
and a highly renowned and respected
journal known as actually Facebook page
and I should probably just take this
opportunity as well to thank my very
hard-working and committed research
partner Google for the part they&#39;ve
hidden head here too so when
scientifically analyzing this
correlation my first major discovery was
that unlike spongebob young people are
not living in pineapples under the sea
yep I
was pretty disappointed too but is the
things that are the same like spongebob
society often believes that young people
are one naive into a sponge now if I was
a young person listening to this right
now my thoughts would be something along
the lines of if this check calls me
naive again I think we&#39;re gonna have
some problems but that&#39;s because the
definition of naive is often thought
about in such a negative way if it shows
information is showing a lack of
experience wisdom or judgment this is
what being a young person is actually
all about it&#39;s the time in our lives
where we don&#39;t have a lot of that
pre-existing life experience to pull on
it can sometimes mean we make some
pretty sketchy and maybe not so well
thought through decisions but it&#39;s not
just a lack of life experience that
contributes to these decisions it&#39;s also
the fact that our brains are still
trying to get their shit together and
develop properly but the good news here
is that young people&#39;s developing brains
are also in prime condition to learn
kind of like they can absorb all this
information just like a sponge
we need to absorb information from left
right and center so it gives me great
pleasure today to be able to introduce
you to my young person who&#39;s kindly
volunteered to help out this is Bob he&#39;s
a sponge like spongebob it&#39;s funny
laughs so Bob like every other young
person in this country in the world is
weighing up life impacting decisions all
the time and because of his lack of life
experience he&#39;s vulnerable to some of
those riskier decisions right so how do
we keep young people like Bob from
making decisions that might be dangerous
or unsafe easy we seemed in experts
someone there is particularly
knowledgeable about or skillful in a
particular area basically they know
stuff and we use these people in a
couple of different ways the first is we
get them to tell our young people is
what and what not to do and with the
second ders we get them to make
decisions for our young people with this
you know around bullying alcohol drives
safe sex we get them to come in and tell
them how is it clear they should be
making those decisions how they should
be living their lives but there&#39;s a flaw
to our logic here and today I want to
show you why so we&#39;re gonna take our
bowl this is like our school assembly or
classroom so you&#39;re sort of environment
that we like to put a young person in to
learn I&#39;ll take Bob shove him in the end
sorry Bob and at this point we like to
get our experts in to come and share all
their wonderful knowledge so we&#39;ll start
with bullying it&#39;s usually their treat
other people the way that you want to be
treated talk and it goes after that we
usually have drugs it&#39;s the health
teacher that tells you if you take drugs
you are going to die dangerous driving
it&#39;s usually the school assembly they
excuse you into driving like your
grandparents necks this is a real good a
personal favorite of most University
students alcohol there&#39;s really far too
much to cover here but if I wanted to
make it specific to DES need it and it&#39;s
please don&#39;t burn any couches and last
but most certainly not least we have
safe sex this conversation usually goes
somewhere along the lines of if you have
unprotected sex you will end up pregnant
and with herpes in chlamydia and
gonorrhea and HIV and what send blisters
all over your dear selves but to make
sure that this could never possibly
happen to our young people we&#39;d
literally just like to throw condoms at
them so they never could possibly have
unprotected sex don&#39;t if you take them
plenty to go around
so what do we lease worth here an
exceptionally overwhelmed young person
and
Hondo infested waters we expect that by
the power of osmosis young people just
gonna absorb all of this information and
never make it unsafe decision again but
what we know from looking out in the
real world it&#39;s not how it happens so I
think it&#39;s fairly safe to say here that
young people and not sponges to be
filled
giving the experts in to scare us into
making good decisions just isn&#39;t isn&#39;t
working
we&#39;re so desensitized to these
worst-case scenarios that we just go
we&#39;re gonna happen to us so I think with
that conclusion we&#39;re pretty safe to say
that is how don&#39;t people with sponges
idea can go so what do we know now we
know that young people are not living in
pineapples under the sea and we know
they&#39;re not sponges but unfortunately
there is another reason why our young
people aren&#39;t able to absorb a lot of
this information so often there&#39;s a gap
a Giffen generation between our experts
and our young people growing up in new
zealand today is completely different to
growing up in New Zealand 30 years ago
it&#39;s kind of the super polite way of me
saying you guys are kind of old sorry
unfortunately we live in such a not
unfortunately we live in a fast changing
world and that&#39;s great but what that
means is the older we get the further
away we&#39;re getting from understanding
what this current day experience is like
only young people know what it&#39;s like to
be a young person and 2017 so they&#39;re
literally makes young people themselves
the experts the only experts of young
people are the young people themselves
that means that any decision that may
that is made that affects young people
needs to be made with them if not by
those young people themselves that means
any information or programs that are
delivered to young people needs to come
from them but I&#39;ll tell you what the
awesome thing is
yeah if we empower young people to be
the experts they get involved they take
responsibility for their ideas and they
own it and you can get some bloody
incredible results and I want to share
with you a story of just how cool this
has been in 2012 an incredible lady this
is her here Carla Sanders I approached a
group of young people in situ otago she
had this great idea for this new
anti-bullying campaign and it was gonna
help young people navigate their lives
online so she went in and she pitched
her idea and they turned around and told
her it was crap why because they were
tired they were tired of being drowned
and information that wasn&#39;t relevant to
them but it was at this point Carla did
something incredible she swallowed her
pride and turn around and asked those
young people what needed to happen let&#39;s
see if we don&#39;t need another one of this
but we&#39;re here why can&#39;t you use us and
so it started with 30 young people
across the otago 30 young people that
believed in a world free of bullying
where every single young person in this
country can grow up feeling accepted and
respected for who they are
it was the same dream that got them
called naive time and time again they
got told bullying is just part of
growing up you&#39;re never gonna get rid of
that but they refused to believe that
all they needed was one person to
believe in them so they could believe in
themselves Carla was that person today
those sticks and stones young people are
changing behaviors from the inside out
and it all comes from them what start is
a blank piece of paper soon became a
name a brand and a logo they are in our
schools every single day they&#39;re
challenging their own actions
challenging the actions of their peers
challenging schools other organizations
and even as high up as government they
design their programs they&#39;re embracing
technology to create innovative ways to
support young people all around this
country
but not only is it pretty incredible for
their peers it can be pretty
life-changing for them as well today
I&#39;ve been given permission to share a
story with you all one of the founding
members of sticks and stones about the
impact it&#39;s had on her life this girl
grew up in a very small rural community
it was the sort of place we had everyone
knew everyone she had experienced some
bullying for the first couple years of
high school and it got to the point
where she received a death threat over
Facebook but she was really lucky she
was supportive family and a great
community behind her to help pull her
through there but it was a day in
September 2011 that changed her life the
night of her dad&#39;s 40th birthday she got
a message over Facebook
and it told her a classmate had taken
her own life she&#39;d never felt more
helpless shocked to this day she still
struggles to be able to articulate what
that felt like and unfortunately there
was a lot more of that feeling to come
and there 8 months that community lost
three young people bullying was linked
to one of those deaths and that was left
feeling angry sad confused but most of
all there was this overwhelming sense of
hopelessness she didn&#39;t know what to do
she wanted to make sure that no no one
else should ever have to go through what
those young people did but she had no
idea where to start no idea whether her
ideas were even worse cheering in 2013
tally came to her school suddenly there
was that sense of hope someone wanted to
listen and hear her ideas as sticks and
stones grew the slang lady got to grow
as well she was able to connect with
other like-minded people all throughout
this country
she alongside their peers gained
experience in organizing events working
with media and have even been known to
collaborate with some of the most
incredible organizations and people this
world has to offer she&#39;s been able to
attend national events and share her
voice on
stage at age 18 alongside some of her
colleagues she traveled to Dublin to
present in an international
anti-bullying conference and she sits on
committees within the Ministry of
Education making sure that young people
voice is valued within that space and
today she&#39;s standing in front of you
delivering a TEDx talk my name is Ashley
Smith at age 13 I went through the most
horrific period of my life but at age 15
someone believed in me and they ignited
a passion today at age 19 I&#39;m
chairperson of sticks and stones and so
incredibly humbled to be New Zealand&#39;s
Queen&#39;s young leader for 2017 I believe
that every single young person in this
country is passionate about something
all they need is someone to believe in
them and then they can change the world
that someone could be you
the only experts of young people are
young people themselves because if it&#39;s
about us without us it&#39;s not for us
thank you for listening
you
