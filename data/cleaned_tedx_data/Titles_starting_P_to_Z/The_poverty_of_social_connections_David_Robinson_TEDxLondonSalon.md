my journey begins on a bus in East
London
I was growing up UUM Hackney and Chow
Hamlet&#39;s made up one of the largest
blocks of urban deprivation in Western
Europe some of us who were at school at
the time raised some money 360 pounds to
be exact and we bought a double-decker
bus we took out the seats and sold them
and we bought some gold posts and some
footballs and some art materials and
some other games and toys and we
arranged a rotor of bus drivers from
plasto bus carriage because of course we
were too young to drive this thing and
they would take it down to different
sites at evenings and weekends we would
run children&#39;s and youth activities on
and around the bus it was fabulously
popular sometimes we get one hundred and
twenty hundred and forty kids at those
sessions and so began Community Links
the Community Action organization which
I&#39;ve been associated with ever since
sometimes I would arrive very early for
those sessions or I would stay behind
afterwards and I would walk around the
estates with the children and we would
talk about their lives there were
conversations which were to shape to my
life I learnt about their overcrowded
homes often cold and damp about broken
heating broken windows about thin
hand-me-down clothes and embarrassment
at school about irregular meals
sometimes adequate sometimes not and
about an entire existence lived on these
few foogoo streets no outings no trips
no treats
I learnt of course that poverty is about
money not enough of it but it was also
about something else my friends and I
were often the only adults outside the
family with whom those children had any
conversations had any real relationship
sometimes even including the family we
were the only people with whom they had
a real relationship even though we were
ourselves only a couple of years older
than they were
and I saw how this relational poverty
was linked to three effects there was an
absence of what we now call cultural
capital the knowledge we acquire from
mixing with others the knowledge about
how to dress how to behave how to speak
in certain situations there was an
absence of networks the people we know
who can be accessible role models who
can introduce us to work experience
opportunities to jobs perhaps can tell
us about college on the wider world I no
doubt in part as a consequence of those
first two effects there was an absence
of belief not aspiration that&#39;s a quite
separate thing but an absence of belief
and absence of confidence an absence of
self-esteem I began to realize that two
things really
first that relational poverty was at
least as aggressive and as destructive
as material deprivation and second that
the two were inextricably entwined of
course it&#39;s possible to be isolated but
not poor poor but not isolated but there
is a particular probability that the two
will coincide and when they do a trap is
sprung relational want compounds
material hardship material hardship
compounds relational what so my
subsequent life as a community worker
has been built around two missions
really one around tackling the material
is the inequalities around those
material essentials and secondly around
building and sustaining relationships
the human essentials fast-forward 40 odd
years hour now as a society are we doing
well be in a better place than we were
four decades ago well I&#39;d like to say
that we are
but I can&#39;t say that honestly one in
four people in you now some 60,000 have
debts they cannot manage now I look
around the world and of course I
recognized that all things are relative
but I also think about a mother I spoke
to at Community Links a few weeks ago at
the start of the new school term our 11
year old son at a new secondary school
at kam home and said that he was being
bullied and indeed being threatened
because of his quotes poor boy trainers
now none of us are a separate from the
society in which we live and if you&#39;re a
lone parent on a low income perhaps also
any regular income you want to do the
very very best you can for your child
what is the right thing to do in those
circumstances we in East London live in
the shadow of Canary Wharf the
difference between their community and
ours has got bigger the gap between the
top 10% of income earners in the UK and
the bottom 10% of income earners has got
about 10% bigger over the lifetime of
Community Links and of course the
extremes at both ends have become more
and more extreme the Trussell trust the
UK&#39;s leading food bank charity gave away
some 42,000 food parcels 7 years ago
last year it was 1.2 million so
sadly I would say that material
deprivation is alive and well in the UK
what about the relational poverty well
most of us network more than ever but
study after study suggests that
meaningful time together is being
systematically displaced by fast and
shallow connections we&#39;re becoming more
atomized and automated simultaneously
our institutions have got bigger and
bigger and more and more remote and I
suggest also that our attitudes have
changed aggressive self interest has
become both a political and economic
orthodoxy and also a kind of new popular
common sense so it is that one in five
of us are lonely one in ten are severely
isolated with clinical implications
I might not these wicked numbers also
account for many others the number of
hospital admissions for self abuse for
instance self-harming
have increased by some 68 percent over
the last ten years more troubles me
about all this is not those absolute
numbers but it is the direction of the
tides we&#39;re drifting apart and we are
doing this for ourselves that&#39;s the
really important part here this is some
kind of act of God we have made these
tides and consequently we can change
them I go back to my teenage self and my
friends buying a bus because we had an
idea about doing things differently and
because it was something we could do we
are the most educated potentially
capable generation that there has ever
been if we can&#39;t beat the causes of
poverty and social exclusion it won&#39;t be
for want of capacity or capability it
will be for want of curiosity and want
of ambition so first on material poverty
why have food banks become our response
to the slashing of the welfare safety
net why not a poor people&#39;s March on
Parliament why such mute acceptance
returning to a position where we don&#39;t
have the levels of penury that
necessitate the charity of food parcels
isn&#39;t about right and left it is surely
about right and wrong our politicians
need to know that we care about these
things and of course there will be
implications for our tax rates we need
to embrace them they are the
subscription that we pay for membership
of a civilized society a second on
relationships
this one isn&#39;t just about politicians in
fact it isn&#39;t at all about politicians
my relationship with you is about you
and me there is stuff here that we and
we alone can do start young pairing and
budding schemes work well in some
schools from nursery to sixth floor
mentoring a mutual support should be
built into school life and as much a
universal part of growing up as school
dinners and playground games maybe
schools aren&#39;t your thing think of your
workplace the intern scheme the Saturday
job offer the work experience program
make it a promise that you won&#39;t draw
from the usual staff gene pool next time
look beyond it adds to it then consider
our communities maybe you&#39;re a shop
owner or you work for the council
certainly you vote for one invest in bed
cheese market street art jokes in the
bus shelter stuff that feeds social
connection and call for a common ground
test the test applied in all our local
planning regulation requiring developers
to design social connection into every
new development every nudist new estate
not as so often happens today to design
it out above all look around we can only
tackle the causes of social isolation by
fundamentally rethinking how Britain
works our cities our communities
everything everywhere imagine a place
where meaningful relationships run
through everything we do
they are the central operating principle
now think of your place
your city your school your business what
would need to change think big
let&#39;s give this the thought the the
depth the reach that it needs there are
quick wins but this is also a long-term
mission make it a generational shift
imagining and planning for the land of
our children and fundamentally
rethinking the way we live our lives if
there was one thing one thing that I
would like you to take away from my
contribution this evening it would be
this make a plan nurture and in bed
meaningful relationships in everything
you do it might now be 40 years a long
time ago but I still remember those
children who would say that we were the
best friends we had not because it was a
ridiculous thing to say after so short
an acquaintance but because I thought
that sadly it was probably true and that
is the nature of poverty of inequality
of social exclusion the nature of life
for some people in the UK today and we
can all do better than that
so please fight the tide make your plan
find your bus
you
