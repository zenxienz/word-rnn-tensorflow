how do you test a new idea especially
one that&#39;s expensive
or will require a lot of effort to
explore and plan we can use an analog
analogs are less expensive they&#39;re
easier to create and they provide a
realistic testing environment for our
ideas have you been thinking about
launching a new business or maybe you
have a project that you&#39;d like to try
but you&#39;ve never done it before you may
want to consider an analog so analogs
are probably more familiar with as with
terms that we use such as flight
simulators you know if you wanted to be
a pilot and fly a high-performance
aircraft you wouldn&#39;t just jump behind
the controls and take off instead a new
pilot will sit in a high-fidelity
simulator with an instructor and perhaps
even a full crew learning how the
systems of this airplane work
recognizing failures and then being able
to do it themselves and of course the
agenda the curriculum has been planned
but they&#39;ll have individual learning
that they&#39;ll take away on areas where
they need to improve to succeed and this
is simulated this is similar in our
medical community where we use medical
mannequins to teach our doctors nurses
maybe if you&#39;ve even taken a CPR class
and then in science we use pilot studies
before we go and launch a big project so
why do we use analogs
well because analogs are more than a
model they&#39;re able for us to test our
predictions and because analogs bring
together a lot of smart people they
widen our perspectives because all those
people are giving their input and
because we go through the actions we
actually do something then we&#39;re able to
lead to learning and discovery so I&#39;d
like to tell you about an analogue that
I participated in with NASA
you know NASA is planning to go to the
surface of a body somewhere in our solar
system soon whether we go back to the
moon or to an asteroid that&#39;s closer to
the earth or even to the surface of Mars
we&#39;ll have done a lot of testing and
preparation before we get there and
analogs are one of the ways we do this
so for example if we want to go to a
near-earth asteroid we&#39;d want to know
how we could actually sample it so we&#39;d
know if there&#39;s useful resources and how
did our solar system actually form and
there are thoughts that maybe we could
use translation lines a lot like the
ropes we set up here on earth to a rock
climb or maybe jetpacks or vehicles and
of course we&#39;ll be living closer to
these bodies to the asteroids and then
going to visit them so the analog I
participated in 2012 was called NASA&#39;s
extreme environment mission operation or
Nemo because it&#39;s underwater and of
course we were looking at how to
actually sample an asteroid so it is
more than a model we went to an actual
vehicle that&#39;s 62 feet below the ocean
surface five miles off the coast of
Florida it&#39;s called the Aquarius habitat
and here it&#39;s about the size of busts
here six of us are crew members actual
astronauts living underwater together in
a high-risk environment that&#39;s isolated
starting to sound like a space station
and we had a smaller Mission Control
team back on that Coast and in that
control team of course we had those
flight controllers that do work at
Houston and we had the same people that
teach us as astronauts and we had the
engineers that build the tools so that
they could see what we were breaking or
what we what we found useful what we
didn&#39;t and we even had flight doctors
there to see if the communication delay
impacted any of the things that we were
doing another important person that
that we had was the safety diver for the
obvious reason of providing the safety
but because they also helped the make
this less expensive because they&#39;re
helping neutrally weigh out any of the
equipment that we didn&#39;t have time to
make neutrally buoyant as well as they
provided that omniscient point of view
because they were around us at all times
so we went out to test these hypotheses
about how to actually work at the
asteroid every day we&#39;d suit up in our
wetsuit and get our helmet on and we go
out in the morning and in the afternoon
to do our spacewalks we started out on
those translation lines and it was
quickly apparent that this was not the
most useful way to sample an asteroid
because we imagined that most asteroids
are going to have loose rubble at the
surface and a translation line does not
allow you to stabilize yourself well
enough unless you&#39;re really only
scooping loose material if you want to
get something more it just won&#39;t work
and you&#39;ll kick up a bunch of sediment
which will be hazardous to you so then
we tried the jetpacks
jetpacks right how cool is that except
we found out it might not actually be
that cool remember those safety divers
they were able to point out that in this
environment of water the water was
providing drag and so it was holding us
close to the surface we were sampling
but if you were really at an asteroid
you would have to put a pulse into your
jetpack for every sample that you wanted
to take and that would quickly waste or
propellant and put you in a precarious
position
so however cool they were we realized
that maybe jetpacks are only good for a
safety measure
finally we brought in the vehicles in
this case they were submersibles and
this led to our big discovery the
vehicle was able to hold us in position
now we could sample both loose material
and firm material and even use bigger
tools because it was a lot like working
off a robotic arm and it provided a
level of safety because we had that
astronaut sitting in the vehicle and
able to look out for us and if we were
working with another crew member they
could look out for both of us at the
same time and because of the mass of the
vehicle
our inputs on the asteroid would not be
wasted propellant that mass of that
vehicle would hold us in place so now
the question becomes if we go to an
asteroid or another body no matter what
we&#39;ve still learned and how many
vehicles do you start pulling together
to do this learning and so that&#39;s left
to another analog now let&#39;s bring it
back to your ideas perhaps you&#39;re
considering opening a new restaurant
what would be the analog well try having
for catering parties back to back with
the team that you plan to use and it
will help you flush out any of the
things that you need to overcome before
doing this or maybe you&#39;re in charge of
your family safety or the safety of your
crew member or your ad coworkers well is
your plan really going to work have you
put it into place
or is it just written up in a document
consider running an authentic drill to
see if your ten-year-old is really
really ready to help you if you are
incapacitated or if your co-workers know
how to use the AED or other equipment
you have finally maybe there&#39;s some of
you there in this room that want to go
to Mars perhaps you want to consider
signing up for one of the analogs that
NASA takes volunteers for or go the
private route with the Mars Society or
things like biospheres to test new ideas
and big projects especially the ones
that are expensive take a lot of effort
and require a lot of time we can use an
analog because it leads to discovery and
learning thank you
