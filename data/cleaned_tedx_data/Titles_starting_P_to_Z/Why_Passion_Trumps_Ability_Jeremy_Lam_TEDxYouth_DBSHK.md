so hello everybody today my talk is how
to pursue your passion and this is a
particularly important topic because
we&#39;ve we hear it many times but I want
to make the argument today that pursue
your passion is one of the most useless
pieces of advices and why is that so why
is it that Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and
other successful business or political
leaders they say pursue your passion
it&#39;s not bad because they&#39;re wrong it&#39;s
bad because they don&#39;t tell us how to do
it or exactly what passion is so today
I&#39;m gonna talk about three things number
one my own journey to pursue passion
number two what misconceptions people
have when pursuing their passion and
number three actually two easy steps you
can do to follow and find your passion
so my journey starts at the University
of Pennsylvania I was accepted to study
finance at the Wharton School and I
thought my life was complete because I
have two parents who work in finance I
live in Hong Kong and so I&#39;m on track to
be one of the investment bankers so when
at university you have 80 choices over
the four years to take any kind of
courses you want and I thought I was
going to major in finance because I was
at Wharton and I first realized that
finance was not my passion I had the
ability I did not have the passion
because I was studying the same finance
course with my friend I asked him can I
borrow your cheat sheet a cheat sheet is
a sheet where you can write your
formulas down legally for the for the
exam and he said I don&#39;t have a cheat
sheet and I said what do you mean you
don&#39;t have a cheat sheet and he said oh
because I don&#39;t need to memorize the
formulas because I spent so much time
reading about this anyway if I forget
the formula in class I can just prove
prove the formula from first principles
in math and I said I thought to myself
you know how am I ever you know we have
the same mathematical ability but do I
spend my whole day reading about finance
no and so I realized that ability is
important but passion is what takes you
to the next level and it will help you
win the race in the end so finding that
finance was not my passion I tried to
major in different things I I took a
selection of courses from every
different departments in the end I
actually ended up with two degrees and
five majors you can see I&#39;m super I&#39;m
super greedy big
one of my majors is politics philosophy
and economics so I couldn&#39;t even choose
between a three so I just took a
combined major and so my mom always says
why is spending over a million dollars
on a college education what are you
studying
and you&#39;re not even studying finance of
why we&#39;ve hang so much and I said no we
bought one degree I got five majors for
a forum for majors for free so it was a
great deal so that&#39;s what I learned in
Business School is to how to make more
make get more bang out of your buck so
so here&#39;s me at university pan Sylvania
five majors I still have no idea what I
want to do so when you don&#39;t know what
you want to do the easiest thing is just
to do what everyone else is doing so so
my next job I tried to get an internship
in an investment bank so I was working

in Hong Kong it was 9:00 to 5:00 but it

was 5:00 a.m. and then I just thought
what is the point of life I&#39;m just
sitting here
there&#39;s aircon but that&#39;s about it so my
second job I took a job in management
consulting and so why do I have this
list of six industries it&#39;s because when
you go to one of these institutions it
might be an American institution it
might be a British it might be a local
institution you sort of have parents or
societal expectations that if you have
the ability you are going to do one of
these six things and so by default I
wasn&#39;t doing finance not doing
Investment Banking so I thought I was
special and better than everyone else so
I went to the second one which is
management consulting so I don&#39;t take
pictures when I&#39;m at work but here&#39;s a
picture of me rowing in New York City
I&#39;m enjoying my time as a management
consultant but over time two years when
I was in New York working there I
realized that prestige is totally an
illusion what does that mean it&#39;s
because my friends really didn&#39;t care
where I worked and the people who are
not my friends they care about where I
worked and so why did I care about these
people who don&#39;t care about me over
they&#39;re not my friends and so prestige I
put in brackets here in quotations
because I think it really is only
prestigious to people who think it&#39;s
prestigious but in reality we derive our
own meaning in life so that was my first
step I decided to leave my management
consulting job and so what else could I
do instead so I try to do something a
little different so my next step was to
move to Hong Kong and I thought you know
dun finance I&#39;ve done consulting what
can I do and I thought maybe the third
way to pursue my passion is to follow
the footsteps of people who have made it
in Hong Kong and whether you like it or
not real estate tycoons are you know
considered successful in Hong Kong and I
thought if I was going to be successful
and passionate maybe I should try real
estate so I&#39;m working in a real estate
fund this is a building that we helped
to deconstruct and reconstruct a
shopping mall that&#39;s right next to the
World Trade Center and the Excelsior and
so I was there one day we were finishing
off the deal and I was tasked with
collecting all the contracts that that
we had to make sure the tenants were
gonna move out soon and so when we
closed the deal my colleague asked me he
said oh how do you feel about finishing
this deal and I asked him what do you
mean what do you feel what am I supposed
to feel and then he said oh don&#39;t you
feel like you&#39;ve accomplished something
remarkable you&#39;re gonna you&#39;ve
contributed to having a building in the
Hong Kong skyline that&#39;s a major
achievement and I said you know what I
did today was I took a box you asked me
to count the contracts I counted 29
contracts and then I put it back in the
box what do you mean I&#39;m building a
building so I realized that once again
because he had the passion he saw it as
something meaningful something bigger
than what it was I didn&#39;t have the
passion I was trying to do someone
else&#39;s passion and to me I told him
today at lunch I had a fried rice inside
there were these green peas I didn&#39;t
like I was counting them out of the
fried rice and I showed him my pile of
peas and it&#39;s the same thing that
there&#39;s peace and then there&#39;s contracts
like what&#39;s the difference so so a few
months later I left this company too
because I was trying to live the life of
someone else this was a third attempt
and so something really funny happened
when I was working in real estate was
that in real estate there&#39;s the tycoons
who bid the auctions there is also the
people who the business owners because
they ran still shopping the shops and
then number three their investors so
there are people with excessive wealth
of themselves or other people and during
my time at this real estate fund no one
ever asked me well you know what do you
think of this real estate what do you
think of this investment
and said my manager was always saying oh
oh you know Jeremy went to warden so
that he&#39;s gonna be handling your Excel
model and so all the clients they would
come in and they would never ask me what
I thought about the business or the real
estate they would just ask me how do I
get my kid into warden how do I get my
kid into the Ivy League and so I just
realized you know since no one cares
about my knowledge and real estate or
finance maybe I should just do education
instead and then the word of mouth
started continuing and then I think two
months into my job these managers and
the founders they started bringing their
kids to work on Saturday and I had to
tutor them and then so the conference
room of the school of the of the office
was my tutoring center and so I actually
made more money on Saturday than my day
job and so I just took that as my last
sign I need to quit I need to do
education so fourth step I moved to
education and so if I wasn&#39;t going to
live a glamorous life like this I was
still in the mode of you know glamour
and prestige so I decided I wanted to
pursue education in in my opinion a
famous way so I actually went to to
become a celebrity turd in Hong Kong
teaching English mostly and so this job
is you know one of my friends kept
telling me for you know many many years
you should do this you should do this
and I said okay I&#39;m though I&#39;ll do it so
I was the only one he convinced out of
his friends to do it and so this job is
actually really hard to get so in Hong
Kong there are two major companies
there&#39;s a and then there&#39;s B I
interviewed with both and then they both
gave me a job so I went to company a so
I went to a company a I worked as an
assistant for one of the major tutors I
laid as videos I I did some marking I
made some notes for him and then six
months into the job I just thought you
know when when are you going to put my
face on the bus or I&#39;m just gonna be
here so so so he said what so he said
you know we don&#39;t we you can keep
working hard and what think about it one
day and I realized the whole thing was a
scam he had tried to scare me to sign a
contract so I couldn&#39;t work anywhere
else and then I would just be there so
because I had turned down company B
before six months later I went back and
I said just joking I changed my mind I&#39;m
here
I went to Company B and then it was not
that simple they they ignored me for
weeks so I called them I called everyone
in the company and they ignored me for
three weeks and so I thought oh no I
I&#39;ve lost this whole path what can I do
and so I was not gonna let them say no
to me because I wanted to I really
wanted to do this job and so my first
step I realized that the company all the
numbers in the the directory they
started with the same six digits as 3/1
actually don&#39;t call them but uh but uh
they start with the same six digits so I
just called I you know the founder is
called person a I asked I call I started
from zero zero and I went all the way to
ninety nine and then I just called I
just called a person every day and I
talked to them and I said oh I&#39;m
actually doing this can you transfer me
to the right person I&#39;m looking for the
assistant manager secretary whatever and
then they kept ignoring me at they took
a message and I never got through so and
then I was like oh oh no I&#39;ve put my job
I&#39;ve been kind of been an assistant for
six months what do I do
so all the tutors even the founders they
actually work as a tutor too and so I
took the timetable of the tutor the
founder and then I just looked where is
he gonna be and so I just went to every
single class that he was because there&#39;s
only two doors and so one door you don&#39;t
use it so I just waited therefore I went
to every single class for 21 days and
then he said I&#39;m busy and busy and busy
and then the 21st day he said okay I&#39;ll
let you talk to someone and then I got
the job and then he didn&#39;t put me on a
restraining order so that was great so I
got the job so this is just some photos
but there was one interesting thing so
he offered me a job I had to wait until
July to start the job because it&#39;s a
academic cycle and so I just thought to
myself the contract is so many years I
will be in my 30s when I&#39;m done with a
contract what in my life do I really
want to do that I&#39;ve never done before
and I need to do when I&#39;m still young a
young adult and taking a deep breath in
my moment of truth I just reflected on
my teenage years and I knew what my
dream was my dream was always to be a
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model at the store
so
it&#39;s something that&#39;s really personal to
me someone gave me a t-shirt when I was
a teenager and I was so ashamed to wear
it because I just thought I was so
different from the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch
model so I went to interview I worked
out for a month I went to interview for
the store model and they said they would
call me in a week and then one week
later they did not call me so I I called
them back and I said did you lose my
number maybe you couldn&#39;t read my number
right and then and then they just said
no we didn&#39;t call you that&#39;s it that&#39;s
it so I was determined to get this job
because it was my teenage dream so I
worked out religiously for six months to
become very muscular and I actually live
near the store so every day I get off
the mini bus it&#39;s right at the door and
I would look in and I&#39;d see these guys
that are always more muscular than me so
what can I do
can I do six months my my other job is
starting I need to land as quickly so I
just thought how could I make myself
muscular when I&#39;m not muscular my idea
you can see it executed on the right a
little bit I was at home I I wore I took
all my t-shirts I wore eight of them at
the same time and then I work out and I
went in and I got the job so yeah so on
the right hand side I think I&#39;m wearing
four t-shirts I had to ask for four to
pad myself but Abercrombie and Fitch was
a really big turning point for me
because I was able to detach myself from
my past identity also one really
important thing in the interview is that
you have to say the slogan at the bottom
it says hey what&#39;s going on so every
time a customer walks by you say hey
what&#39;s going on to make the store see
more American and the importance of this
it was the first time I realized that
English is so important because it at
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch there are two jobs
one is called model so you had the
storefront like this and then the other
job is called impact where you are
somewhere in the back so I just realized
that whether you become model or impact
it depends not only on the way you look
but how will you speak English and so
and so when you say this line and you
say it while your English is good you
are presentable then you work at the
storefront as a model
and if you are if your English is not
good if you cannot speak well then you
you will be in called an impact and you
will be at the back folding clothes and
so I realized that I realized that
whether you are presentable why do you
speak English it will determine whether
or not you are the model or the impact
and that really has affected my my
tutoring job and so mm-hmm so when I
pursued my passions
you know unexpected things happen so my
parents were really concerned that I was
majoring in linguistics they don&#39;t know
what it is it&#39;s not even English so what
are you gonna do with it so one day the
magazine called me and this is Cecilia
charm on the left she&#39;s talking with her
two sons in broken English and the
magazine asked me what do I think about
her use of grammar and so I told them oh
she made a mistake in these two words
and then it became a cover story about
how she&#39;s a negligent mom because she
cannot speak English on the right I&#39;m
being interviewed by CNN about what
students think about Donald Trump so I
just I never you know six years ago when
I graduated as a linguistics as a
linguistics major as one of my majors I
never thought that you know six years
later I would use this in such a way but
looking back I was really happy that I
just went from my interest and life will
work itself out if you do well enough
and you persist long enough so I want to
talk about what passion is not because
it&#39;s so easy to get confused between
something nice and passion so first of
all passion is definitely not prestige
prestige is an illusion it lives in the
minds of other people but not yourself
so always think about what you want and
not what society tells you think about
if no one cared about this thing would
you also care and very often the answer
is no number two prestige is not money
so at a certain point when you start to
make a certain amount of money when you
start to make certain amount of money
the you you don&#39;t want to work as hard
if you don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing
that&#39;s why people with a lot of money
they actually don&#39;t want the money
because they just do it for fun that
their job or their career number three
Fame is also not passion
those three are easy but I have number
four number five are a little more
difficult to understand a hobby or an
interest is not necessarily a passion so
for instance you know playing video
games all day long it&#39;s it&#39;s fun but it
really isn&#39;t a passion I&#39;ll tell you why
later and sometimes even an industry or
a job is not really a passion that&#39;s
because you know I can be a teacher or a
tutor that&#39;s what I do I go to class
every day or five times a week and I do
I like every moment of teaching you know
honestly no but but I I enjoy it when my
students send me a message saying oh
because of your class I was able to go
to university which was never possible
before or I was able to migrate with my
family to Australia or even I just never
gave up because of you or sometimes
people say oh I got a job at ANF and I
go take a picture with them so so so
passion is north these five things
instead what is it so the importance of
passion can be reflected in the
education system when you apply to top
universities everywhere in the world
they&#39;re looking for these few things so
this is for America but it&#39;s the same
everywhere so at the bottom there&#39;s your
GPA which is your school grades you have
your SAT and your ap or IGCC scores your
exam scores but after those qualitative
factors everything above is qualitative
so there&#39;s your activities your
interview your recommendation your essay
it&#39;s no longer about abilities or skills
or talent is actually about why you
choose to do something or what it means
to you and so everywhere you go people
there&#39;s an abundance of ability there&#39;s
abundance of talent but actually
something that people lack is passion
and because the tournament or the
competition is so intense that it&#39;s easy
to forget what&#39;s important and
meaningful to you so the reason why it&#39;s
important is that when there are a lot
of students that come and say oh I have
no passion or the mom might say oh my
child just likes to play computer games
all day long and what they think is that
if I had passion I have a magic potion I
drink it and I&#39;m suddenly interested
enthusiastic determined motivated so on
the left-hand side it&#39;s the common but
incorrect notion of passion which is
it&#39;s instant
and you get it you dream about it and
suddenly you have the inspiration to be
a successful person but it&#39;s not like
that
on the right hand side is what I believe
passion looks like a little more it&#39;s
over time it&#39;s much longer it comes in
waves that get bigger and bigger and
bigger every time so you get something
you you know you you move away from it
you fail a little and then it comes back
bigger and then it comes back bigger
every time it could be the same thing it
can be something different it can build
on your previous experiences so passion
is something sustainable over time it&#39;s
not necessarily an emotion it&#39;s actually
more like determination but more
specifically there are when people say
passion they are thinking about interest
or inspiration it&#39;s actually not bad at
all I think that passion is these seven
things number one you actually have to
have interest in what you&#39;re doing but
you need six more things number two you
need talents right because if you&#39;re not
good at it then no one&#39;s gonna value it
number three you need to be determined
to persevere throughout the adversities
number four there needs to be a
sufficient monetary award if you&#39;re
doing it for a career you need to be
able to pay your bills number five there
needs to be significance beyond the
individual level so if you&#39;re doing it
for yourself it gets boring after a
while but if you&#39;re able to help and
impact others that is a passion so
number six you need courage because you
have to say yes to new things I need to
learn to say note in old things or the
things that you don&#39;t want in your life
anymore and number seven definitely
takes time it&#39;s not an instant thing so
how do pursue your passion people say it
how do you do it it&#39;s very simple
actually I&#39;ve boiled it down into two
steps number one you have a list of
things you can do you eliminate them so
for me I knew I didn&#39;t want to do
finance and then I knew I didn&#39;t want to
be an investment banker and I took these
out one at a time and so I took action
on everything else
I studied several majors you can just
take some courses and then the second
thing after I had one iteration I tried
again so I went further down one path I
took some out that I didn&#39;t want and
then I just keep repeating so in summary
for everyone in the audience who still
hasn&#39;t found his or her passion yet
don&#39;t stop it&#39;s it&#39;s not that difficult
just stop dreaming start doing and you
won&#39;t find your passion because if you
continue your passion will find you
thank you
[Applause]
