so I remember the first time my son said
he was sitting at the kitchen table over
a bowl of oatmeal and it just slipped
out really easily I&#39;m not smart enough
and my heart broke a little because it
was happening to him in my line of work
I talked with a lot of people about
their experience in school and over the
years what I&#39;ve noticed is that people
walk away from their kindergarten
through twelfth grade education with a
really good sense of all the things
they&#39;re not good at something or things
that made them feel inadequate at the
time but because it&#39;s such a formative
period it became part of their identity
as an adult overwhelmingly people leave
school knowing ways in which they aren&#39;t
as much and the reason is that instead
of seeing us for everything we are
traditional school and traditional
education spotlights all the ways that
we don&#39;t need expectations and this is
such a common experience that we take it
for granted
but we really shouldn&#39;t because we&#39;re
missing the chance to help people
translate their uniqueness into an idea
of who they can become and so here&#39;s my
question what do we really want for our
kids what do we want for society what if
education could be designed in a way but
it was about recognizing and cultivating
each child&#39;s humanity helping them
nurture their interests and strengths
and expanding their idea of who they
could become so I&#39;m gonna ask you to sit
back and just imagine something with me
you work in an office building that
overlooks a park in your desk is by a
window and one morning in September you
see four kids come to the park they&#39;re
different ages they stay for a couple of
hours that day but they come back almost
every day over the next several weeks
sometimes it&#39;s just one sometimes it&#39;s
all four sometimes they&#39;re only there
for an hour sometimes they&#39;re there all
day
they draw they sketch they take pictures
they talk to kids on the playground and
they climb in the branches of these
trees nearby so your curiosity gets the
better of you and you start eating lunch
in the park and you find out that these
four kids go to a school in town called
spark house
and over the course of the next nine
months they&#39;re gonna be building a
community treehouse William is the
oldest and he developed this idea
because he wants to develop the skills
that allow him to manage complex
projects and diverse teams Elijah is 12
and like many kids with autism he is
really intense interest in his case it&#39;s
engineering and rapid prototyping he&#39;s
never had a hard even easy time in
school he was put in special education
other kids found him weird so he was
socially isolated but he loves designing
and iterating on ideas for the treehouse
he&#39;s working on writing skills and
social skills skills things that he&#39;s
always hated because they&#39;re important
to something that he&#39;s passionate about
Mariana is a sophomore and spark house
is a place that has asked her to think
about how she learns and she knows that
math when it&#39;s about formulas on a page
or screen are really confusing to her
they swim around but when she can see
things and math applied developing a
budget designing blueprints or a tree
house it all clicks and makes sense and
Francis is Tammy her dyslexia means that
she spent a lot of her time in school
feeling dumb and behind in writing and
reading but it&#39;s Barkhouse she&#39;s allowed
to use text-to-speech and dictation
software and she&#39;s allowed to build on
her visual and spatial strings now in
the past she&#39;s been called bossy and
she&#39;s had trouble interacting with her
peers and working in groups but William
has been a really great mentor to her
and working with Elijah brings out a
nurturing side to her now in addition to
building the tree house this team has
been researching the environmental
impacts of different building materials
they&#39;re weighing issues of cost and
sustainability against their budget
they&#39;ve applied for permits they&#39;ve
talked to town council meetings they&#39;ve
applied for grants
they&#39;ve solicited pro bono support from
people in the community so over the next
nine months you watch as blueprints are
drawn up you join dozens of young people
and adults in the community to help
build the tree house and it becomes real
and at the ribbon-cutting the next
summer you watch the look on these four
kids faces and they realize that they&#39;ve
contributed in the meaning
away to their community and you wonder
what it would have been like to go to a
school like this now what I just
described to you is a radically
different way of educating young people
it&#39;s deeply learner-centered I don&#39;t see
their role as facilitating learning
experiences with and for young people
I&#39;ll contrast this to what I call school
centered systems where we decide upfront
what every kid is gonna do and then find
ways to try and make them do those
things learner centered education starts
with each child&#39;s individual interests
adults serve as advisors asking them to
think about who they want to be in the
world what they want to contribute and
what pathways make sense for them and
what this means is often going out into
the community and doing meaningful
projects now this type of education
isn&#39;t something Toby in fantasy it is
actually happening in schools around
this country but not nearly enough
because I think it needs to be the model
for how we educate all young people what
I think but what I think about when I
think about the treehouse project is the
future of smart which is based on two
big ideas first we&#39;ve got to bring the
whole range of human experience back
into education we&#39;ve got to value what
it means to be real human beings and
second we need to recognize and embrace
the unique potential of every single
person there is no one definition of
smart each of us is smart and the
challenge is to figure out how to find
the fit between our passions and our
strengths and who we want to be in the
world so let&#39;s start with this first
idea I&#39;m being fully human you may be
familiar with Rene Descartes he&#39;s famous
for the saying I think therefore I am
now the underlying assumptions of this
phrase have deeply shaped the Western
world essentially dividing human beings
into two parts first there&#39;s the mind
that&#39;s the part of us that engages in
rational thought it deals in
abstractions it wants to take feelings
and emotions and reduce them down to
data points that represent reality
it likes standardization and efficiency
and then there&#39;s the body that&#39;s the
part of us that is about our lived
experience it&#39;s about our emotions it&#39;s
the part of us that engages in play in
non structured nonlinear
not efficient ways of being but the
bigger point here is that we need to be
in the world both experientially and
intellectually and what&#39;s interesting is
that this left-right this but my body
divided tracks what scientists are
finding out about our right and left
hemispheres our right hemisphere acts
like the large end of a funnel it takes
in sensory experiences and our
experiences in the world and the process
that processes them holistically in a
way that allows us to understand our
experience in the world the left
hemisphere takes those big pieces of
data and and in a linear sequential way
reduces them down to abstraction and
that&#39;s really important for helping us
to manipulate the world to be fully
human we have to embrace our bodies our
minds our right and our left hemispheres
and we know this intuitively it&#39;s not
enough for me to know that I&#39;m loved
pain to be with my children with my
family success at work isn&#39;t just about
having learned business theory or having
a graduate degree it&#39;s about actually
being able to weave teams and finish
projects now school centered systems and
school centered education neglects these
types of experiences it&#39;s focused almost
exclusively on the life of the mind
you only get credit for math if you can
pass a paper and pencil or
computer-based tests applying math by
building a tree house doesn&#39;t count it&#39;s
built on the idea that learning happens
inside the walls of a building
everything else is an elective an extra
curricular or a hobby and you don&#39;t get
credit for the things you learn to do
and be while you&#39;re engaged in those
there&#39;s a standard idea of what every
kid is supposed to know and be able to
do whether you want to be an artist a
contractor a plumber a lawyer you&#39;ve got
to take the exact same classes and
school centered systems divide things up
they divide knowledge into discrete
subjects they divide kids by age even
though these things are totally divorced
from how we actually live in the world
and finally they measure learning and
really standardized ways the common
thread here is efficiency it&#39;s efficient
and that&#39;s the problem because school
centered systems flatten out the
realness of being human
in the interest of efficiency so let&#39;s
compare this to our treehouse team they
were engaged in a messy complex
real-world task
there was nothing abstract or
standardized about it the treehouse was
real and it was unique they learned
about things in integrated ways because
it turns out that geometry physics
design aesthetics are all connected if
you want to build a functional treehouse
the kids will want to play in the kids
got to explore possibilities they fail
they regroup they try it again the
process might not have been efficient
but it allowed them to engage both with
academic content and also with feelings
and experiences in fact that was part of
the point was to engage with each other
with their mentors with the community
and in doing this they debated they
argue they resolved conflicts they
developed empathy and compassion they
were to support each other and they
learned to persist not because of grades
not because of AP credits but because
they cared they&#39;ve chosen this project
it meant something to them and like all
of us wouldn&#39;t care about something we
don&#39;t need external rewards and
punishments to persist now the second
idea of the future smart is recognizing
and embracing the unique potential of
every person school centered systems
prefer sameness policymakers make lists
of things that every kid is supposed to
know and be able to do take the right
courses learn the same content every kid
is gonna come out and be a leader a
collaborator an innovator the list goes
on
in some places it&#39;s hundreds of pages
long and that list becomes the focus and
that&#39;s the problem because it makes the
goal of Education trying to make every
kid look like that standard average kid
and when a system that prefers sameness
encounter something that doesn&#39;t meet
the standard or doesn&#39;t fit the mold it
throws it out and that is figuratively
what we do in our current system when we
label kids dyslexic autistic hyperactive
not proficient and the point is they
don&#39;t meet some artificial standards
13% of kids in the US are dead diagnosed
with the learning does that
this is 16% increase over the last six
years and the vast majority of these
disabilities don&#39;t affect them when
they&#39;re not inside of a school it seems
to me that when you have to label that
many kids the problem is with the system
and not with the kids because because
different brains are good at different
things like Francis forty percent of
scientists at NASA are dyslexic they may
struggle with sequential linear
processing but their brains excel at
holistic processing which it turns out
is really important for the work that
they do at NASA Elisha&#39;s autism means
that he sees possibilities differently
than other people but that&#39;s really
beneficial to him in his passion for
designing and and rapid prototyping
embracing diversity means that we&#39;ve
gotta let kids chart unique pathways
we&#39;ve got to build on the assets that
they bring instead of always focusing on
the ways that they don&#39;t need some
artificial standard now some of you
might be worrying that educating kids in
this way isn&#39;t gonna prepare them for
the real world but what we&#39;re doing is
not preparing them for the real world
either American students continue to lag
behind other countries on international
tests just by billions of dollars
invested over the last few decades to
improve the system that happens to be a
metric the school centered system cares
about but beyond that we have 65% of the
American public that doesn&#39;t actually
have a lot of faith in our education
system and that includes a lot of
employers but most concerning to me that
our kids aren&#39;t well there&#39;s been a
doubling in hospital admissions for
suicidal teenagers over the last ten
years and that number spikes every fall
right after school starts compared to
other industrialized countries we have
the highest rates of anxiety depression
self-harm substance abuse bullying and
youth violence there is something
fundamental wrong fundamentally wrong in
our support of young people and I would
argue that school centered education is
part of the problem because when it
comes to preparing kids for the real
world
everything indicates that the world
demands what learner-centered education
produces until relatively recently the
majority of Americans cited power wealth
and status when they were asked to
define success in other words success
was about competing and winning usually
against somebody else&#39;s definition of
who you should be but that&#39;s changed
recently researchers found that 80% of
people now cite some aspect of personal
fulfillment when they&#39;re asked to define
success yes that&#39;s great place that like
spark house explicitly asked kids to
develop a sense of self a sense of
purpose and that&#39;s critical in any type
of personal fulfillment and that&#39;s
comparing it to school centered systems
that focus on competition ranking and
sorting which is leading to stressed
unwell kids and just as our values are
changing the world is changing we can&#39;t
even imagine the world we&#39;re preparing
our kids for many of the jobs they&#39;re
going to apply for don&#39;t even exist yet
how many of us knew what an app was 20
years ago let alone that there were 1.7
million jobs related to it who knew that
the mindsets and the skills that are
associated with mild to moderate
moderate autism would be a driving force
in Silicon Valley&#39;s success we had no
idea what differences are gonna be
critical for where the world is headed I
think of it this way biodiversity is
important in natural ecosystems because
it lets systems adapt to unexpected
changes neurodiversity this idea of
different brains different people is
critical for human systems because it&#39;s
going to allow us to adapt to changes
that we can anticipate but we can&#39;t
predict and that brings us to our last
the last reason that learner centered
education is not only impossible it&#39;s
necessary in a world with artificial
intelligence and technological
innovation human beings have to play to
their comparative advantage
remember that mind body left
right hemispheric divide it turns out
that artificial intelligence is really
good at the left hemispheric mind and
stuff where it falls short is when there
are unknowns or unpredictable
possibilities which is a standard state
when we&#39;re trying to take on real-world
problems and yet that&#39;s where human
beings can thrive with complexity and
uncertainty and in situations and
settings that require us to demonstrate
authenticity compassion empathy human
connection we just have to make sure
we&#39;re educating our kids in ways that
let them develop these deeply human
capabilities we&#39;ve got to let each kid
find their treehouse it&#39;s time for us to
trust our instincts that education can
be so much more than what it is it&#39;s
what the world demands
it&#39;s what my sons require and it&#39;s what
all kids deserve education needs to
focus on developing healthy
well-adjusted human beings who are
capable of living individually
meaningful lives in an increasingly
complex world and that is the future of
smart
