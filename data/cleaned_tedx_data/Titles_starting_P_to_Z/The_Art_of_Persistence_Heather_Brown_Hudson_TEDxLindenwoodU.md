resist persists occupy
rise up
expect us do these imperatives sound
familiar yes yes they are probably
tattooed somewhere on my body but this
that&#39;s another talk these are the
imperatives of a generation the battle
cries of 21st century social movements
they are also part of our currently
trending hashtag culture the words that
you may or may not be able to make out
from these photos behind me are from the
women&#39;s March in DC this January these
are the words that facilitate collective
action and social change
when invoked alongside what writer
Rebecca Solnit caused a politics of
process these words have created and
continue to create unprecedented
collective action rendering visible what
are typically unnoticed cooperation and
persistence the women&#39;s March in DC and
its sister marches all over the world
and their continued pervasive efforts
are a perfect example of this fellowship
I&#39;d like to shift emphasis from the
aggregate force of these terms to be
able to dissect what I think to be the
most critical of all because it&#39;s the
single imperative that stands to
facilitate all the rest it&#39;s the one
that catalyzes the remainder despite the
context or goal without persistence
there can be no rising up persistence
sustains the efforts of so many in this
era of popular resistance these are
efforts that may never bear fruit in our
lifetime but remember persistence is
often germination for belated blooming
meaning that simply demonstrating
persistence becomes a trait that has
legs
don&#39;t underestimate where it may take
you so this is a picture of me when I
was about 12 years old Cyrano around
this time I began taking gymnastics
classes with a few of my girlfriends in
the neighborhood just to clue you in 12
years old is very old
begin taking gymnastics classes were
once or twice a week I got to hang out
with my girlfriends and be silly I
thoroughly enjoyed them I used to learn
how to do all these daring moves finally
finally getting to do a back walkover
without crumbling to the ground was a
feeling I will never forget the aerial
back handspring front semi off of the
springboard all over the horse thing
learning how to do these moves was
exhilarating notice I said learning and
I have to stress this learning part
because it is the act of learning class
after class month after month that has
stayed with me all these years 30 years
later it was the coach spotting me again
and again showing me how to do the moves
what I was doing wrong so I could fix it
I stressed the learning part because in
all honesty I don&#39;t think I ever knew
how to do any of those moves let&#39;s put
it this way some gymnastics kids are in
full swing pun intended by age to
semi-retired Eddie and basically injured
by 12 so I was getting taller
I was growing in other ways and I also
had some lovely braces disastrous shag
haircut and to top it all off a fancy
perm so so now that we&#39;re clear how
striking I was off the gym mat let&#39;s get
to the gym at my accomplishments on the
gym mat okay my biggest enemy gravity my
back handsprings reminded me of this
fact but I just couldn&#39;t stop trying
could not stop trying to get it right I
would regularly hold up all the other
kids behind me who are waiting for their
turn telling the coach upon falling to
the floor for the ninth time in two
minutes let me do it again one more time
one more time I&#39;ll get it let me do it
again
he often obliged me but no matter the
move I always struggled with the
execution I requested to do it over and
over again one more time so by the time
our big gymnastics show case came
I was as good as I was gonna get uh and
it was gonna be videotaped I never saw
myself doing gymnastics before so in my
mind I was graceful smooth I was at my
most flexible my most confident and I
generally enjoyed performing so
everybody was proud parents coach me I
was over the moon so at the end of the
show the coach gave out awards
predictably I did not get an award that
indicated I was a skilled gymnast but I
got an award that reflected my
persistence I watched that VHS tape a
little bit later week later or so at my
friend&#39;s house on our giant tube TV I
was dumbfounded not only was I none of
the adjectives I just mentioned
gracefully
I was a happy sloppy confident ball of
chaos close your eyes and just imagine
with me one thing imagine for a moment
the human version of a heaping pile of
adolescent mashed potatoes trying to
execute a back handspring precisely yeah
fortunately for me though I was a kid
hooked on persistence and not perfection
so persist I did so maybe my talent was
not recognized but something else was
and this recognition has stuck with me
all these years
coach gave me the one more time award
straight-up made up
I didn&#39;t care I was being recognized for
something that would stay with me very
long after my pedestrian flipping
capabilities were a thing of the past I
was being recognized for something that
I didn&#39;t even need an able body to
implement something that I never knew
one could get recognized for yet the
reinforcements that my endurance and my
efforts were qualities that were
valuable outside of the flippin was a
complete game changer I was recognized
for my persistence by continuing in a
course of action in spite of difficulty
opposition and malfunction to persist is
to understand that a current may be
working against you and you will advance
on regardless it&#39;s a survival skill also
and it&#39;s critical however it is
important to remember that persistence
is not intrinsic and it needs to be
fostered persistence can be modeled it
can be taught and it should be inspired
each of us can share in the
responsibility of being persisters for
brothers and for people so when I intend
to take this work of persisting beyond
self-interest toward an area of
cooperation where despite all sorts of
risks cognitive material there is a
return there is always a return on your
investment this is because persistence
is contagious from the gym map to the
classroom the small act of allowing me
to persist and then recognizing me for
this gave rise to a horrendous gymnast
with an unflappable work ethic and a
boatload of confidence if you think
about it especially educators we are
always asking persistence of our
students we are requiring it really show
up yet we rarely spend time modeling
this behavior or positively identifying
it even good news it&#39;s not too late we
can all start right now when we ask an
audience to bear with us during a
presentation snafu we&#39;re asking them to
persist
when we you know get through the
presentation we have demonstrated
persistence when Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren kept reading that
letter by Coretta Scott King during a
Senate debate earlier this year despite
requests that she stopped she modeled
persistence in action my seeing
potential in my students is paramount to
my ability to persist on university
campuses potential is bursting at the
seams come August in January the
persistence persistence takes the
downturn come week five or six and I
think that persistence can invoke a
singular and collective spirit of
something either that we want to attain
or reclaim you can get back to class any
time this can be a goal any goal
political academic health-related or
personal but when persistence seems to
fly in the face of expected outcomes
it&#39;s easy to question its worth in her
new book the new better off courtney
martin interrogate our commonplace
assumptions about how younger people are
choosing to persist in to forge ahead
she finds that the old American Dream
may no longer be doing it for them her
research reveals that Americans are
actually no longer pining for their
parents or their grandparents version of
the American dream instead persisting in
their own ways on alternative paths to
seek happiness and success through
avenues that disturb the cliched dictate
that homeownership marriage and a
nine-to-five job frame the quest for the
American Dream that is despite the
notions that do persist about being well
off her findings are that young people
are coalescing toward more of a
community finding value in and seeking
worth from reinventing the often trite
upwardly mobile to-do list to step back
from my gymnast years and my current
days in the classroom let&#39;s circle back
to those battle cries of the
Republic an expert on social movements
dr. michael white recently suggested in
his latest book the end of protests that
activism today is a crossroads between
innovation and irrelevance dr. White&#39;s
tactics are meant to ensure that the
next generation of activists doesn&#39;t
suffer from generational amnesia which
he sees currently plaguing our culture
his message focus is not on the Y but on
the how of persistence and on the how of
protest in other words he offers us a
manifesto that speaks in part to the
starting place of persistence and I
suggest that if we can move this how
into the classroom to the office the gym
the writing desk wherever we need it we
will start seeing positive outcomes how
comes that may not result in MVP awards
but outcomes that can see us to the end
of our goal whatever that is it might
not be to fall down or to go to class
today we&#39;re gonna make it to the end of
my shift at build-a-bear whatever it is
active persistence should get you there
I always tell my students that the
semester is one long musical and if I
can&#39;t implement a musical theater
analogy in my classes I have failed so
here it is day one you come in you are
canned canning your way into class front
and center in the chorus line notebook
color pens out ready for your solo and I
tell me this is really great awesome
start but remember you need to make it
to May or December so as you can can can
your way out I also tell them to my
short-term memory much better than my
long-term memory and for that reason
alone they have got to remember the last
scenes choreography and not neglect
their final wardrobe change even if that
number has the worst choreography and
the most dreadful costumes in learning
communities discomfort is paramount and
being willing to examine the sources of
our discomfort is one of the ways that
persistence can happen
so if persistence is the bullseye space
around it has got to contain connection
work cooperation empathy even anger
these are the tools we need to hit that
target when handling them be deliberate
in using them be the most deliberate
heaping pile of adolescent mashed
potatoes that has ever flipped thank you
