so I work too
here in Florida which for me means that
I spent a lot of time sitting down at
kitchen tables and maybe talking to a
forester about how we can buy their
forest and turn it into a park I might
sit down with a farmer and talk to them
about how we can keep their farm a farm
producing fresh local food rather than
become a shopping mall or I might sit
down with a rancher and talk to that
Rancher about how we can make sure that
their ranch not only works for cows but
also works for wildlife so when I tell
people what I do they intuitively kind
of get that well buying land and
restoring habitat might be expensive so
one of the first questions they always
ask me is mark how do you pay for that
and see that question right there is a
problem
it&#39;s a problem in part because you do
pay for it if you pay income taxes if
you pay property taxes gasoline taxes
sales taxes
some of those tax revenues go to some of
the programs that I use but the real
problem is that you don&#39;t know that you
pay for it and how we pay for things a
large part determines how we value them
I bet you know exactly how much your
house is worth because you pay your
mortgage I bet you know how much your
car is worth because you make a car
payment you probably know how much the
shirt on your back and every doodad and
bobble in your life is worth but the one
thing that all life depends on nature
most people have no concept of the value
it&#39;s really common to say it&#39;s priceless
but we destroy it so it&#39;s clearly isn&#39;t
so how do we value nature let me tell
you how I value nature I grew up in the
country and I learned to value the back
40 if you grew up the country what the
back 40 is is there&#39;s a part of the farm
that a farmer doesn&#39;t farm they just
leave it as woods and they might do that
because well they they like to go hiking
or fishing or hunting on it but the real
reason is is that the trees that grow in
the back 40 have value it&#39;s a piggy bank
it&#39;s a crop that grows itself and so if
there&#39;s a medical emergency in the
family if a kid needs to go to college
or heaven forbid a crop fails
the farmer can go harvest those trees
and make it through the season so I grew
up understanding the back forty kind of
like a piggy bank but I was also lucky
enough when to grow up with two wildlife
biologists for parents and they showed
me that the back 40 had a lot more value
than just as a PE Bank that it helped
make sure that we filtered a lot of the
pollutants out of our water bodies that
it had absorbed stormwater when there
was a flood there was a safe haven for a
lot of the wildlife we enjoyed and that
it even kept us cooler in the summertime
so while I got to see the back 40 as
this great service provider I also saw
it as this piggy bank
those services are things that you and I
use and we need but however we value the
back 40 that value is not actually being
given to the farmer they could only
realize value out of that property when
they took it away and so that if we&#39;re
ever going to save our environment we
have to find out a way that we value
nature to actually turn into monetary
value for the people who take care of it
and this is a particularly true in
Florida because over the next couple of
generations 13 million people are going
to move to the state of Florida that&#39;s
as if the entire state of Ohio moved to
Florida and I thought we had Knuffle
high winds here already I&#39;m from Ohio so
I&#39;m gonna show you what thirteen million
new people means to the state of Florida
now I got a couple maps I want you to
really pay attention to them here&#39;s the
first one this is a map that all the red
areas on this map are our current cities
and towns here in Florida this is what
Florida looks like if we have 13 million
more people as you can see much of our
natural environment our farms and our
forests are going to be lost and that&#39;s
going to be made worse by these 13
million people who are gonna exacerbate
existing issues that we have with sea
level rise with biodiversity decline
with water supply water quality
wildfires you name it it&#39;s gonna be a
lot harder to deal with
and so we in particular need to find a
way to value natural Florida or else
it&#39;s gonna go away so what if there was
an easy way for you guys to help invest
in the saving of natural Florida and in
return you got those services you were
guaranteed those services that nature
gives us all
now I mentioned a couple easy ways that
you guys pay for things in your life I
mentioned a mortgage I mentioned a car
payment who here pays a utility bill
you&#39;re lying you do we all do and you
know the thing about nature and
utilities is they do a lot of the same
things for us so what if there was an
eco utility one that invested in nature
that restored it and protected it and
then rewarded you with nature&#39;s services
that you didn&#39;t just pay a monthly bill
because nature and utilities do have a
lot of income and you pay the utility to
give you clean drinking water right well
doesn&#39;t that water come from our natural
aquifer and you pay the utility to treat
sewer that we all create and to make
sure that it does include our rivers and
streams well wetlands treat the polluted
runoff water that we all create so that
we don&#39;t have polluted rivers and
streams and you may not know this but
here in Jacksonville we have a storm
water utility whose job it is to make
sure that we aren&#39;t flooded but when we
have a hurricane isn&#39;t it the dunes the
marshes and the wetlands who are
protecting us from a lot of flooding
already so nature and utilities do a lot
of the same things for us but one of the
cooler things is is that we even know
how to value them the same way I&#39;ll give
you an example so when you pay your
sewer bill you&#39;re actually paying for a
wastewater treatment plant that&#39;s right
up there behind me and see one of the
ways that we can value a wastewater
treatment plant is we look at its cost
efficiency how much it costs that
wastewater treatment plant to treat one
a pound of pollution so let&#39;s say that
wastewater treatment plant it costs it
400 dollars to treat one pound of
pollution well if that wetland also
treats one pound of pollution is it not
giving us a $400 service I think so and
if that wetland treats 20 pounds is that
not an $8,000 wetland so not only do you
Atilla teas in nature do a lot of the
same things for us but we can actually
compare their values and in that way we
can invest in an eco utility can do the
same things for you that your utility
does they&#39;re just doing it via a
different way by investing and restoring
in nature well how does this work mark
well let me give you some examples now
water if we have 13 million more people
come here we&#39;re gonna need more drinking
water there&#39;s not enough and we can try
to find new supplies of water we can try
to desalinate the ocean but that&#39;s
really expensive trying to take salt out
of salt water we can conserve water
which is good we should do it but that
means I have less water which and I&#39;m
thirsty
it also MIT has some negative social
impacts and can also be more costly but
what if there was a way that we could
invest in nature that we could assure
ourselves more water in the aquifer at a
rate that no more than we&#39;re paying
right now and the way we would do it is
we can access a source of water that
none of us even know that we&#39;re using in
our everyday life what do I mean by that
I mean paper now how many of you have
driven down an interstate and Florida
passed through rows upon rows upon rows
of pine trees doesn&#39;t make i-10 exciting
well believe it or not pine trees don&#39;t
naturally grow in rows they were planted
that way and the reason that we plant
them that way is by and large so that
they can be grown to be turned into pulp
for the use in the production of paper
and here in the American South we
actually produce more paper than
anywhere in the world or the paper
capital but the thing about when you&#39;re
growing pine trees for pay
is you try to squeeze as many pine trees
into a small of area as possible to
maximize your income now I have nothing
against paper keeps a lot of rural
people employed but it does change our
landscape quite a bit so that a paper
forest looks a lot like this Roza pine
trees really dense very low biodiversity
all you see is Pines when our natural
pine forests around here should look
like this now do you see the difference
there&#39;s a lot more pine trees in the
paper for us and what a pine trees all
use water next time if you want to
change how you perceive the landscape in
Florida next time you drive down the
interstate look at all those trees as if
they are drinking straws they use a lot
of water to the tune of a couple
hundreds gallons per acre per day extra
over a natural forest condition so what
does that mean in total well that means
hundreds of millions if not billions of
gallons of water per day that we&#39;re
using effectively to grow paper so what
could an eco utility do in this case
well they could just invest money with
foresters to thin out their forests
restore it to a natural condition what
does that mean well it means that the
foresters are still getting paid so they
don&#39;t care it means that there&#39;s more
water in our aquifer and our forests are
more healthy and you want to know the
coolest thing about it it&#39;s 8 to 33
percent more profitable for the
foresters growing trees for water rather
than paper so that&#39;s just one thing in
eco utility can do now here in Florida
we&#39;ve experienced a few hurricanes here
recently so a 13 million people moved to
Florida where do you think they&#39;re gonna
want to live right next to the water and
that&#39;s problem because that means a lot
of our real estate and our people are
gonna be at more risk to future
hurricanes and it&#39;s not just a problem
in the humanitarian sense that&#39;s a real
problem for the national flood insurance
program we&#39;re going to be more risky to
insure and so as a result
everybody&#39;s insurance rates are gonna go
up now what if an eco utility
I could go ahead and invest in dune
restoration invest in marsh
rehabilitation and fix some broken
wetlands they can then base on a real
argument that they&#39;ve reduced the risk
to all of our water adjacent homes go to
the National Flood Insurance Program and
argue for a reduced rate and as
customers to the Eco utility the only
bet that you have to make with them is
that you will pay less than what may
save you in flood insurance that&#39;s one
of the things Nico utility can do and
you know I started this thing out with
the back forty and what one of the
things the back forty does is it treats
pollution and when thirteen million
people come here there&#39;s gonna be a lot
more pollution running off our yards or
streets and everywhere else
well what if an eco utility pays the
farmer to keep back 40 to restore the
back 40 to treat allow the runoff water
we all create the farmer gets value out
of the back forty that isn&#39;t harvesting
the trees we all get cleaner rivers and
streams and we have a more natural
Florida that&#39;s one of the things that
can eco utility can do but you know what
I think the biggest thing in eco utility
can do as they not only will make you
value nature in a way that means
something to your pocketbook but I think
they can make you investors in it when
you see how well you get returned for
having just given a little to nature if
I can give you a bill that says hey last
month we provided you with 600 gallons
of water and we restored four acres of
forest if I can give you a bill that
says that we treated a couple pounds of
your pollution and we built a wetland
how are you gonna value wetlands and oh
by the way we save your house and all
your neighbors from a hurricane and we
saved you money on your flood insurance
how are you gonna feel about the dunes
and marshes I think you&#39;re in a value in
a way that&#39;s completely different
and that&#39;s what I want an eco utility to
do because if we don&#39;t find new ways
better ways to value nature
we&#39;re gonna lose it all and I don&#39;t
think we can afford that thank you
