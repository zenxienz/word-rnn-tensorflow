what happened to you during this short
silence did it bring you more or less in
contact with yourself your neighbor the
whole audience or the space in between
us I&#39;ll leave that question to you what
I do know is when we enter the silence
we entered yes we we we enter the shared
domain and that share domain has a
certain quality in that share domain in
that silence were equal we equal in the
light of something bigger am I talking
about God or something
no I&#39;m talking about a Hertz
a herd of horses horses have survived
for 65 million years by the wisdom of
the earth horses are prey animals horses
are probably more a we than a me she it
happens always and always on the right
moment so what interesting is all the
information of the herd is still present
in every single horse you meet every
single horse you meet you can meet the
wisdom of the whole herd you can make
contact with the soul of the herd but
for us humans is not so easy to get
access to that information and that&#39;s
because for the simple reason we are
predators
we are predators because we think in
lines they move in circles we think in
goals in focus
for her movement in itself is the most
essence element for us dependency is
something we have we have at least
ambivalent emotion about for her
dependency is a blessing but if we can
connect in a way that she allows us to
be part of her hurt then we can get
access to vital information about a way
we are connected to our own hurt our
grandfathers our grandmothers everything
which happens in our history everything
which made us what we are right now why
because she will tell you in a split
second if you are a reliable member of
the hood and it&#39;s nothing personal it&#39;s
nothing personal it&#39;s just feedback or
feed-forward whatever you call it from
with rooted back to the soul of the hood
it&#39;s not personal
first let me introduce you to us now
this is Kelly and she&#39;s my leading man
it touches me when she makes contact in
this way yeah
she&#39;s 31 years old she&#39;s my leading
mayor and my name is whit whit Clara I&#39;m
a coach consultant and I work with the
wisdom of the hurt in transformation
processes in companies and on a personal
level both when I bought her when I met
her she was given up for dressage
because she cannot bend because of her
back problems so this horse had no
future and that was a safe here at the
time I looked at her and I thought I&#39;m
gonna save you but in fact
she saved me how did this happen again
it&#39;s nice it&#39;s nice that you noticed
that that she first asked me for this
movement and then I say okay go and she
makes it
I worked for two years every day every
hour every minute every second and with
every minute I could get my hands on to
get in real contact with her but she
didn&#39;t allow me
she just didn&#39;t allow me I was totally
obsessed with it two years long till one
morning one Saturday morning she was
standing in a paddock in the corner and
the session ended the same as all the
sessions before
carolien standing in the corner her back
towards me stiff no options to move and
I was waiting in the middle waiting for
something to happened but she could not
escape there was so much pressure and
this morning the same thing happened but
I saw something different
and I couldn&#39;t look at it anymore
and I just I know I remember it I turned
around but it was too late it was too
late because the picture of her so
frozen in the corner had already hit my
body it just hit my body and my head
became dizzy my legs became heavy and
there was this unknown pain which flow
to my to my body and it must have been
there for a very very long time and it
was so strange because in that moment I
heard a deep right beside me and I felt
three whiskers nose hairs tickling
against the back of my hand for the
first time Caelian stood right beside me
right behind me for the first time she
allowed me to be part of her hood and
more important maybe I had become part
of my of my own hood of my own in a hood
miron I want you to ask you to take
Kelly in with you just my daughter thank
you very much
after that moment with Caelian my own
learning moment I became a horse&#39;s head
coach and ten years later I&#39;m standing
in a riding school in a Manish it was a
seminar it was a seminar about personal
issues and there was this all the woman
who comes to me I think she was 65 years
old she looks at me and she says I have
a rather difficult heavy issue and you
know I don&#39;t want to talk about it but
maybe I can look at it can you help me I
said yes but I didn&#39;t know how and we
started the seminar I know I remember
and there was first was a guy who went
into the paddock but the horse couldn&#39;t
connect to the guy because it was
already connected to that woman and the
horse stood still in front of that woman
on one meter distance in total silence
with only the rope in between them and
it was such a silence it had such a
waited everyone in the group
instinctively moved backwards to make
space for the process which happened and
what I saw was this deep interaction
this woman sitting with her hands on her
lap receiving whatever it was in full
contact with the horse in totally
silence and a sentence hit me it
top it was not my sentence it came from
out of the field and because I promised
her not to speak I said it in my head
and the sentence was dear child when
it&#39;s my time I will follow you and she
looked at me I was just it not was the
end of the session and after the seminar
she comes to me again
she says Ruth thank you and your horse
for offering me the possibility to look
at my firstborn child who died
immediately for the first time she was
65 years old and she continued
it&#39;s a strange I feel more connected
with him than ever and it&#39;s so strange I
feel more alive than ever and moreover
in some kind of silly way I feel open
for everything to come and I was
flabbergasted and I looked at her I
looked at her face there was no emotion
no drama no tears nothing what I saw
what I noticed what she entered another
state and I call it a wee state a wee
state
it was the first time in her life she
looked at this very dramatic event for a
moderates it&#39;s dramatic when you lose
your child and now she had looked at it
until then she could not look at it she
had excluded it from her life she had
excluded it from her past
and now it was included she was no
longer separated from her past but had
become a part of it and feyza feyza the
past had become a part of her life like
a like a source like a resource and the
strength to say about such an event
Dennis what the horses do this is what
horses do and to be honest I don&#39;t
understand how it works there yes there
is scientific research search for
written on Google that I don&#39;t
understand but I see it happen what I
see happen is that they offer us a we
state and in that we state we&#39;re in some
kind of way are very gently open for
everything reality gives us and has
given us our blessings our traumas full
potential everything in a strange way
everything it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s everything
which made us who we are and probably
what we what we will what we will be but
it&#39;s a resource that is what I was doing
thank you very much this was what I
wanted to share with you with without
galleon
