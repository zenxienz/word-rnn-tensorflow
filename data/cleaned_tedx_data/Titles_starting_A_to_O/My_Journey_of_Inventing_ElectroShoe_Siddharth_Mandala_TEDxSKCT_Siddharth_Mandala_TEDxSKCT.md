so before I start I think there will be
a consensus here that any statistics of
a number of women being raped in any
country would be too many but we live in
a large population and with that reality
comes many staggering statistics and
responsibilities as of 2015 according to
National Crime Records Bureau every day
95 men were raped that is 95 women today
yesterday and tomorrow this is the
horrible average that exists in our
country now by the time I&#39;m done giving
this talk
chances are under 1 has been raped I was
failure stolen in advance then took
place I did not even know what rape
means back then my mom used to take me
to this nearby rally as a woman this
incident was very dear to her she wanted
me to the world and his problems no
broader perspective like most kids I
used to play a lot of video games like a
lot and Shane wanted me to take
everything for granted and to my
surprise this one instant didn&#39;t change
my perspective and shape with the many
goals and efforts that I will be
focusing on in the next few years while
the incident was horriffic it also had
an effect offering yours so many people
who demanded a change so I went home to
the challenge and tried to come up with
some rough sketches products ideas and
their implementation some of them turned
out to be very very impractical and some
of them were only simplified I kind of
saw this process like a game
I thought rapers this level 19 balls
that you would face in Dark Souls kind
of flame right well I was definitely a
weird kid back then so I went home to
the challenge and the ice I kind of came
up with this concept called electro show
after much trial and error and I
explained this concept to my best friend
Abhishek fantastic guy he was there with
me since day one
so we started working on this I am
Telling You we absolutely had no sense
in fashion over what women wanted in a
put
and if you actually take a look at this
thing you would all agree that you would
all agree that we absolutely had no idea
I mean if you actually I mean would
anyone know a few here actually wear
this thing and god I sure hope not
because cops would actually first York
at the conducts a time bomb but yeah but
we understood physics and we understood
that something had to be done
so what for was an education electronics
embedded systems aided by Internet Red
Bull and couple of sleepless night we
felt like we were these lone Warriors
for trying to solve this problem rape
again I know it&#39;s lame but hey sometimes
you need to be the hero of your own
story to get their works out so which we
tried learning as much knowledge that we
can about embedded systems electronics
from internet and various resources and
I used to spam random people on lincoln
in facebook whenever my quadrant workers
and kind of shameless in this way and
it&#39;s all something that i would
encourage others here who are interested
in effecting a change never be ashamed
of what you do not nor what you cannot
do these same is in your pursuit of
knowledge and resources
know that there are people out there who
might not be personally motivated to
healthy art but they can be actuated by
your enthusiasm
so the guy who had this was Joseph
Stalin was the guy who had this was
Joseph Solomon he had this understand
some of the core concepts between why it
happens in annex manage my method and
way to implement it now I would be lying
if I thought I never got frustrated we
had to start from the very fundamentals
such as piezoelectric effect how does it
work
does it create enough charge if not what
can we do to make it produce more charge
after working on this this guy Joseph
all-in-one he he made us show that we
get these fundamentals right
and after Marinera we&#39;re able to execute
this electro show so I thought the next
step would be to actually let people
know about this amazing journey after
went through explaining this thing I
would be lying if I told us I haven&#39;t
got frustrated but that never stopped us
biologically I can tell you with the
hindsight that failures mirror on the
right track if your approach is not
faring then you&#39;re probably not testing
it hard enough so by that definition we
were actually talking this thing up our
prototype failed 17 times miserably
I got electrocuted twice while working
on it my friend I be shake even develop
in nozbe at one point he&#39;s better had to
rush all the way to my house and pick
him up
but these failures and setbacks actually
has just for some of the interesting
innovations best memories and adventures
we had together
honestly the time I&#39;ve been working on
is for the tour of this for me
I was thinking learning researching was
just very very educational
so the one hopsicle we could not bring
forward examinations and our parents
rate on the law that we have to cause
electroshock for a while and constrain
our words
so as enough as soon as the votes were
done I jumped back into my work
recognized another some fear impatience
to what we could do technically I felt
like the next step would to let people
know about this amazing thing we created
and I emailed better India and I wrote a
your story blog about this journey we&#39;ve
gone through I wanted to let everyone
know that the process we&#39;ve gone through
inventing this thing
and to my surprise when I woke up next
day had over 2,000 is falls from random
strangers and so let me a phone rang
again I answered they said that they&#39;re
just reading math put in love your work
Frank and again my phone rang again this
time it was from a recognizable number
that was from a friend who in cornet was
a local newspaper so now while all of
this might actually seem fool I panicked
it was too much experiment one single
day now throughout my life I&#39;ve never
been this social and suddenly everyone&#39;s
eyes were on me so I quickly deleted the
US tour applause but it&#39;s already too
late
people started copying my story and
pasted it on your websites and magazines
then people started messaging that when
is a project going to come out when I
water with air planning lyrics and all
that other stuff
I recognized that I needed to get back
to my work and focus on that and what
actually happened was after I actually
hit that thing that foot on the first
floor instant I realized that I was
letting people down I started there with
this huge anxiety because I already used
a couple of incubators and discuss some
of the major flaws I bought my shoe such
as getting necessary rights making it
water-resistant I understood that
turning an invention to our visits the
whole different thing and suddenly the
people whom I knew from the very
beginning
my best friend started to hate me the
friends who might hit the - well our
road trips with the friends whom I did
some crazy attention to stuff started to
despise me
this one single exposure just kill our
years of friendship I felt so alone
I couldn&#39;t even explain the situation to
anyone and the people whom I never met
in my life
indirectly they smash at me with all
these high expectations every day the
shade from started to skyrocket hundred
thousand two hundred thousand three
hundred thousand shares every week and
my inbox just get piling up with
people&#39;s gratification
I don&#39;t know what to do at the time so
identically the people whom I met on
social media whether once we actually
heard me I emailed my education
counselor Club Singh at 2 a.m. in the
morning
Rani saw again someone whom I met on
social media taught me focus on other
stuff that I wanted to work on he made
sure that I don&#39;t get swelled into a
fear of being judged and we both a trend
of creating this amazing simple skin
skin cancer detection tools and honestly
in this critical situation
you only need someone to help you get
focused on the track and do what you
want to do sometimes you already know
the answer but you will never accept it
until you hear it from someone whom you
can delete on a very personal level I
also realized that you will get hate no
matter what you do it is just another
hurdle telling you that you&#39;re on the
right path but at the same time you need
to wait for the right people to
acknowledge you for the right reasons
unable to push your work forward and
trust me we are probably living in the
most interesting we appear in the
history of the earth we&#39;re on the verge
of artificial islands 5000 currencies
blockchain technology I mean just think
about what kind of wonderful a wonderful
era we are living here hello your
failure to pursue even further now I&#39;m
not saying that I&#39;ve mastered this skill
but I&#39;m more handsome confident that
this is the right path try to acquire a
work ethic that will power you through
insecurities and self-doubt find the
common ground that supports your skills
and perceive it with so much dedication
that saying no to you should be
impossible make the most of your lucky
position and really think about how you
can contribute to the community and as
easy and pleased as it may sound never
give up the world needs you more than
ever
thank you very much
you
[Applause]
