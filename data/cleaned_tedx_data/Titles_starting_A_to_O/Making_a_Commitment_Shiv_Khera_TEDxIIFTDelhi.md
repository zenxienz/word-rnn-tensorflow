good morning folks January 1973 I
remember very distinctly we had coal
mines in India and they got nationalized
the government took over and right from
being a mine owner we came on the street
Street Main Street we had a thousand
people working my father had died when I
just about finished college we were left
with the liabilities and the assets were
gone and I was just married four weeks
then some of your calculating my age but
that&#39;s your problem but folks I saw my
life change we started selling little
little things to get money for food we
started selling furniture I remember a
year later my daughter was born and I
saw some of the last pieces of my
mother&#39;s Julie to get a release from the
hospital
did not have ten bucks to buy milk that
night I tried my hands on three
businesses with no money and I failed in
all three finally November 13 1975 I
decided to live in there my sister
sponsored me from Canada went to Toronto
rented a one-bedroom apartment we were
sleeping on the floor we had no
furniture my wife is an MBA she took up
a job as a cashier at a bank at six
hundred dollars a month to keep money
coming in for food and I used to go out
wearing my suit and my tie doing nothing
and when people asked me what do you do
for a living I was embarrassed to tell
them I am
unemployed I used to say I do
import-export
don&#39;t get me wrong I tried went on like
this for a year now just about that time
after a year I was going through a trade
show and a young Canadian was following
me from behind
looked like a handyman came close asked
my name and he asked me what do you do
for a living I said import/export and he
asked me how much money do you make now
I did give him a rather flat answer I
said that&#39;s none of your business but
that day it got me thinking it doesn&#39;t
matter how many suits and ties you where
people can tell you got nothing inside
well I asked him his name was bill weir
and I said what do you do for a living
he said I simonize cars folks people who
don&#39;t know what Simon izing is it&#39;s a
glorified word for washing cars with the
machines that&#39;s all well I asked him how
much money do you make
he says sometimes $25 $30 45 55
depending on number of cars oh I wash as
we went out of the auditorium as if he
could read my mind
right outside he stopped me look into
the eye and he asked me would you like
to wash cars with me
I started thinking how long can I go
like this I got nothing to eat
I asked him what will you pay me he said
I&#39;ll take off five dollars for the
chemicals rest we will split half as a
when do we start is at tomorrow I asked
him I said build washing cars is not
high-tech you&#39;re doing well by yourself
you don&#39;t need a joint-venture
collaboration why do you want to split
money with me he said share washing cars
alone can get very lonely I just need
somebody to talk to that&#39;s all well next
I went out washing cars we made 25 bucks
each
the day after 45 25 55 every day started
making little little money
and I started buying things for the home
and right about that time I saw an ad in
the newspaper you want to make some
extra money do the door-to-door demos
for vacuum cleaners I&#39;m sure you must
have seen those I responded to the ad
there were a couple of hundred people
they gave us a pep talk and they said go
do the demo and every demo you do you
get paid five bucks folks I was
genuinely knive I actually believed we
only had to do a demo and not do sell so
I used to go to an apartment building
knock at door when the lady or the man
used to open I used to say ma&#39;am you
don&#39;t have to buy the vacuum cleaner all
that you got to do is take a demo and
I&#39;ll get paid five bucks so some people
took pity on me let me come in some
people kicked me out and some people
slammed the door and that was fine one
day I was doing a demo in an Indian
family&#39;s home and the man and woman were
sitting on the sofa and I was on the
floor and this man instead of looking at
the vacuum cleaner he kept looking at me
all the time so I asked him sir
did I do something wrong he said no I
said then why do you look at me this way
he asked me she have you ever so life
insurance I said no I have never so life
insurance and besides I never will
because I remember back home in India
that agent that pest who would not live
your life for three hours till you
signed the application I said no wonder
they called him life insurance agents
because they don&#39;t live your life well I
said I will never be that pest in my
life he said no shame it doesn&#39;t work
that way here look at me I&#39;m a life
insurance agent look at my lifestyle I
Drive a Lincoln later when I came to
know he was working for MetLife and they
had a recruitment drive going on
if you recruited a new salesperson you
would get a Samsonite briefcase so I was
they
briefcase well folks I finished the demo
and I left but then you cannot go
straight you go the other way round we
were living in the same building and
somehow his wife became friendly with my
wife and convinced her that selling life
insurance was the right thing to do and
my wife also knew we couldn&#39;t go through
life washing cars we had to do something
different I had a family to support our
little daughter and my wife also knew my
failure record and life was pretty good
even in school I wasn&#39;t the brightest
kid I was the backbench a troubling the
front benchers in my eighth grade after
six or seven subjects I failed and all
except one
so my principal called me and said she
will paying too much attention on one
subject well folks out of 28 kids I was
number 27 because the 28 was absent no
kidding my principal used to call my
parents and tell them get this kid out
of the school he&#39;s one kid who&#39;s gonna
bring the average of the school well I
was bringing the average down I told my
wife I&#39;m not selling life insurance
she said she do sell life insurance you
gotta take an exam why don&#39;t you take
the examine if you pass if you pass you
have a choice right now you have no
choice I said all right I&#39;ll take the
exam what I won&#39;t sell folks I took the
exam and guess what I I passed well this
guy who&#39;s got everything rolling took me
to his office introduced me to his
district manager was a very sharp
elderly man by the name of Joe Bonney
and he said Jim if you decide to become
life insurance agent right now I&#39;ll give
you a draw of a hundred and fifty
dollars a week and I&#39;ll give you time to
think before I would draw the offer he
said you got 30 seconds to decide I said
Joe you said you&#39;ll give me time to
think he said you have 20 left now I
said I&#39;ll take it and now I became a
life insurance agent which I never in my
life ever wanted to be now they gave me
the book the game
little training and they said boy goes
sell and folks for the next three months
I went out selling I put in a hundred
percent why a hundred percent I actually
put in two hundred percent we all can
tell when we&#39;ve done our best we all can
tell when we&#39;ve not done our best I can
look at the mirror and say I did my best
and guess what
I broke the company&#39;s record well
obviously you&#39;re not impressed why you
oh thanks a lot well wait till you find
which record I broke how many sales I
made almost none so my manager called me
right back he said I&#39;ve been in it&#39;s
life insurance business 35 years and
I&#39;ve seen some slow starts in my life
but I&#39;ve never seen one like you
he said don&#39;t come back tomorrow you&#39;re
fired I said wait a minute Joe before
you fire me at least you hear me out I&#39;m
not an educated person I&#39;m not a doctor
and Geney attorney accountant I&#39;m a
become third division failed in my 10th
I got a handicap how do you expect
performance out of me folks that day
somebody spoke very harshly to me and
I&#39;m glad he did and later on I realized
it was not anger it was concerned and
here&#39;s what he said to me he said you
shut up you shut up and listen to me he
said you don&#39;t have a handicap you got a
bad attitude
and it is people like you not only do
they do they ruin their own lives but
they also ruin their family&#39;s life too
and he said do you know who has a
handicap in life he said the doctor
engineer attorney accounted they all
have handicaps I said boy never heard
that one how do they have handicaps
he said go check out all over the world
it is generally true exceptions
different they all have chosen they feel
they&#39;re stuck
they all have chosen the filthiest stuck
he said you haven&#39;t chosen your field
don&#39;t you see the world is open to you I
said joy never thought from that point
of view he said now that you&#39;re fired he
said you got all the time
things that leave my office folks I left
his office that day that evening I had
an appointment about 30 miles away I had
a choice to keep her not to keep I knew
I had no job next day I might or might
not get paid for it well I decided to
keep that appointment that evening it

was 6:30 while I was driving having
failed one after the other in my life
that night I was feeling so depressed I
don&#39;t know what happened to me I just
burst out into crying I couldn&#39;t
understand what was going on in my life
I had a family to support I had a little
daughter I didn&#39;t know how to earn a
living I kept crying I kept praying that
night that 30 miles distance seemed like
30 years it&#39;s a lot easier to talk about
it tonight it was not easy that night
seven o&#39;clock I reached my appointment
got a handle on myself went up started
selling by the time the man looked at

his watch it was 11:30 I got in at 7:00
no wonder they call life insurance agent
past four and a half hours I was sitting
there he said do you realize what time
it is it&#39;s a polite way of saying get
out and he said I gotta go to work
tomorrow morning I said I realize but
somehow that night I wasn&#39;t moving he
looked at me I looked back at him I
don&#39;t know what got into this person&#39;s

mind out of 11:30
he asked me what does it take to get rid
of you right now I thought he was asking
me the rates on the insurance I opened
the book back again looked at the age
looked at the factor multiplied with
insurance and I said sir that&#39;ll be
$27.50 he said what I said 27 dollars
and 58 cents he looked at me
disgustingly why didn&#39;t you tell me when
you walked in he wrote me a check and he
says take this and get out before I
change my mind folks that was one of my
first sales came home midnight next day
morning I went to my office I went to my
manager and I said Joe I got an
application today
it&#39;s a small one but it&#39;s a bound one
with a check but without a check has no
meaning and I said Joe will you let me
stay I make one commitment to you I will
not let you down because of my effort
but if you fire me today I don&#39;t know
where to go
the only place I know where to go is go
back to washing cars and I said I don&#39;t
want to do that anymore I got a family
to support but I commit I won&#39;t let you
down he looked at me he says shift that
was that&#39;s not just small one that&#39;s
your big one and he said I&#39;ll only let
you stay here if you make a commitment
not to me but to yourself I&#39;ll let you
stay folks that day I made a commitment
that day I made a commitment and that
was one of the turning points in my life
and he would do the papers and that year
I went ahead sold close to a million
dollars next year 3 million the year
after close to 5 million moved on to the
US got into 3 businesses bought out a
company out of California in 1984
started a New Jersey operation with no
clients and I sold my company with close
to 500 clients now folks why do I share
my life with you for a few reasons
number one I kept failing all my life
and kept blaming the whole world for my
failure not realizing that I was my own
biggest problem nothing changed outside
something changed inside here and the
direction in my life changed folks let
me ask you many times in life aren&#39;t we
our own biggest problem and the second
lesson I learned was folks when he said
to me you shut up and listen to me I
learned that day that sometimes in life
you got to be unkind to be kind and I
realized one more thing that the
greatest coaches in the world are the
greatest critics in the world for
and that they also realize one thing
that there are only two relationships in
life that care to correct
well punishes only two relationships in
life care to correct only parents and
teachers in life care to correct the
world punishes and that&#39;s the time I
realize the difference between a promise
and a commitment folks a promise is an
agreement we make with the world a
commitment is an agreement we make with
ourselves and folks unfortunately
today&#39;s world runs away from conviction
commitments in fact they confuse the
word commitment with confinement not
true in fact confinement restricts you
commitment frees you in life to do a lot
of things and folks that&#39;s the time I
realized the difference between a moral
commitment and a legal commitment I
realized that in life moral commitments
are way way way stronger than legal
commitments and in this world of
commitment phobia the basic ingredients
to success is missing and if we want to
succeed in life we need to make a first
commitment to our values that is
integrity live a life of integrity
that&#39;s first commitment to we need to
make a commitment to ourselves 3 we need
we need to make a commitment to our
families
4 we need to make a commitment to our
organizations and our customers and 5
need to make a commitment to society
only then and then only we have the
basic ingredient and found
datian to success god bless thank you
very much
[Applause]
