before we reimagine the future of
longevity we&#39;re through a quick pop quiz
on something you learned earlier I&#39;d
like to ask you to count that number of
times the letter F appears in this
single sentence not a trick question
just read the number read the sentence
count the number of times the letter F
up here&#39;s in the sense okay I know you
guys are fast readers how many people
saw all three most of you anybody see
for some of you anybody see five okay so
the real answer is six and so now that
you know the answers you can count the
six FS I&#39;m gonna help you out five flies
of of scientific of hiding plain sight
as Robert said earlier now young kids
can see these things two older we get
the harder it is for us to see these FS
that&#39;s another depressing future of
aging except I&#39;m here to tell you it&#39;s
good news you know why because that F
could represent the future of longevity
in fact that F represents functional
longevity that&#39;s what&#39;s coming now
what&#39;s current longevity current
longevity is we&#39;re living longer and
stronger lives or we&#39;re not solving your
online problem aging so we&#39;ll create an
older population that needs to consume
more health care that&#39;s a vicious cycle
when you do something radically
different than that this is whack Amole
the current system right so let&#39;s build
it ground up from first principles
living systems the first principle is
selection favors increasing homeostatic
capacity now what&#39;s what we said a
capacity well here are some definitions
resilience for a bus test you can read
the rest of the list but it&#39;s it&#39;s
easier if I show you
you remember homeostasis which is a
state of equilibrium when we set a
capacity is your ability to get to
homeostasis which is think about it like
a weeble wobble that&#39;s my other favorite
toy you push it and it self centers
that&#39;s such a when nature gave us and
it&#39;s so successful that we don&#39;t realize
we have it until we start losing it
right around my age so here are the
things I lost I&#39;m gonna catalog for you
I turned 40 and all of a sudden I
couldn&#39;t ride a roller coaster or do a
cartwheel
to a somersault because now I come out
of it wobbly my weeble doesn&#39;t
self-centered and I say I don&#39;t want to
do it anymore my kids have no idea what
I&#39;m talking about my kids have no idea
what I&#39;m talking about
when I said 8,000 feet I don&#39;t feel well
they&#39;re running around they&#39;re sprinting
at 8,000 feet I&#39;ve lost something my
weeble doesn&#39;t self-center when I go
into a restaurant my peoples won&#39;t open
up enough so now it&#39;s too dark you know
outside 55 degrees my kids are in
t-shirts and I made two layers
I&#39;ve lost my ability to self-center when
they get sick they&#39;re sick for two days
they&#39;re totally fine I get sick I&#39;m
coughing for a month you know ice to be
able to stay up all night in college and
feel fine the next day I want to see
Coldplay last Wednesday I was still
tired on Saturday there is no recovery
recovering from an injury wound it just
takes forever you know I still eat
anything now I want to eat a bad meal I

wake up at 1:00 a.m. so is it really bad
diet alone is it also lost when we set a
capacity I&#39;m losing metabolic capacity
this the reason I think all high-end
athletes are retiring at 40 because all
of a sudden though homey set a capacity
across-the-board Czar&#39;s declining those
are the subjective experiences of
lawsonia static capacity
now think about objective things you
can&#39;t feel when we&#39;re young and our
blood pressure sugar go high or homey
static capacity returns at the
homeostasis except after 40 and some of
us they stay high and we give it names
like diabetes and hypertension what if
all these things are just features of
loss when we set a capacity just one
thing we should always look for the most
parsimonious explanation for this prayer
for Naaman on may be lost when we
aesthetic capacity is that explanation
and that we just can&#39;t see it because in
evolutionary terms were stuck in a
adaptive Valley where it&#39;s an uphill
battle to see a completely new way of
treating the human body so in order to
create a new system we created a prize
with the industry leaders and scientific
leaders called the power of the prize my
wife and I put a million dollars in to
create this new system that we want to
see and we recently announced a two
million dollar donation to the National
Academy of Medicine to foster new
innovations and the way we think about
aging now in order to do this we have to
fundamentally change the way we think
about things again build it bottoms up
our bodies our dynamics
and yet we&#39;ve been using static models
of study at what am I mean by this
physics cut integrated by treating as a
dynamic system Minkowski added the
fourth dimension that physics integrated
space and time and all of a sudden now
physics made sense we need to do the
same thing in biology files you right
now at three Natural Sciences let&#39;s just
add one more dimension make it four
dimensional and it&#39;ll change everything
let me explain right now when you go to
the annual checkup a doctor will measure
your heart rate blood pressure glucose
cholesterol these are all state
variables that&#39;s like a seismic
scientist trying to forecast the
collapse risk of a building based on the
angle of declination that&#39;s not what
they do they do resilience testing right
that map&#39;s much better collabora so we
know that our heart rate doesn&#39;t change
your whole life our heart rate response
to exercise what the clients so why are
we using the thing that doesn&#39;t
correlate with aging and risk instead of
using the one that actually does
correlate now imagine doing this to
every diagnostic test turning every
diagnostic test into a resilience test
dynamic diagnostic is a new diagnostic
field we got to create on top of the
current field to bring it up to date to
the 21st century 100 years after physics
the goal here is to add temporal
resolution to biology we have great
spatial resolution getting smaller and
smaller but it&#39;s actually our the time
domain and that&#39;ll change everything
it&#39;ll also change the way we do drug
discovery because instead of think about
longevity as the endpoint we can think
about homeostatic capacity as endpoint
that&#39;s something we can measure right
now how resilient are you let&#39;s stay
healthy a whole lot longer and longevity
is a free call option okay so when you
think about therapeutics now we&#39;ve got
to think very differently than we have
been instead of trying to restore
homeostasis let&#39;s increase homeostatic
capacity let&#39;s focus on capacity
building instead of just trying to solve
the problem the way we treat
hypertension right now is we give you a
blood pressure lowering medicine your
blood pressure - I try to prop up the we
bowl with a drug and what happens he was
propping up it causes system atrophy
your body actually it gets worse and
eating more and more drug this is like
the coffee model it&#39;s a great pick-me-up
but the more you drink the more tired
your baseline so you can&#39;t solve chronic
problems with these acute therapies
that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing for the
last 100 you
what&#39;s the best way to treat high blood
pressure is to exercise and when you&#39;re
exercising you&#39;re raising your heart
rate and raising your blood pressure and
your home is set of capacity acts as a
drug and restores normal blood pressure
imagine putting blood pressure raising
medicines into the body low doses
intermittently as a way to lower blood
pressure we&#39;ve never tried this except
we know it already works in fact we know
it works in exercise the more you make
the body worse the stronger it gets it&#39;s
like building a muscle or you can take
about a like bassant vaccination make
the body worse it gets stronger
completely counterintuitive building
capacity instead of solving the problem
is the future of therapeutics now
there&#39;s something I&#39;m even more excited
about there&#39;s an old idea in evolution
called Wiseman&#39;s hypothesis which is the
idea that maybe senescence was actually
a trait this idea wasn&#39;t biology for
many decades until 1953 when Nobel
laureate Peter Medawar said you know
senescence is unlikely to be a trade
because it occurs after you finished
reproducing that&#39;s known as Mathers
argument and people stop thinking about
senescence as a trait that you could do
something about so now the assumption is
aging is something that happens now
here&#39;s the counter-argument to metamours
argument we just lost miss Amanda aging
now he was reproducing long after he
started aging so maybe man where&#39;s
argument applies to females it doesn&#39;t
apply to males and I would argue even in
females menopause happens during
reproductive age there should have been
runaway selection to defer menopause it
didn&#39;t happen so I don&#39;t think MANOWAR&#39;s
argument holds fact if you look across
nature they&#39;re species that have no
evidence of senescence solving
senescence doesn&#39;t violate the laws of
physics right because we are not a
closed system we can always acquire more
energy to fight entropy but I&#39;m not here
to debate whether or not senescence is a
trait or not I&#39;m just gonna take the
road less traveled because the idea that
senescence might be a trade has not been
looked at in decades and yet this is
exactly what might be possible when you
think about this possibility I think
it&#39;s actually quite like it we&#39;re gonna
be able to find these and be able to
edit it out because it&#39;s happening
already
there was an old idea biology that cells
have programmed into them
death and aging that was a heretic alai
dia until now it&#39;s accepted well what
are cells that are programmed to age and
die who edit out their own genes today
they&#39;re called cancers it is happening
all over the place now cancers the
scourge of humanity but why don&#39;t we
focus on not only what they&#39;re doing
wrong what are they doing right how are
they able to edit out their senescence
pathways sometimes your greatest enemy
is your greatest friend as Bob Marley
said now I think that there are
interesting things that we already know
that are destroying that are genetic
traits that are destroying our body
after 40 Clarke&#39;s control systems repair
mechanisms and power these other things
are all in decline every cell under
performs a little bit after 40 and the
cumulative effects of that are probably
the features of aging so let&#39;s go find
those genes edit the amount they could
be the end of senescence as we know it
relatively soon which is crazy now it&#39;s
only 1953 that we discovered the code of
life this is James Watson who
co-discovered the double helix
ironically the year we discovered the
code of life is a year we stop thinking
about the code for aging and death so
it&#39;s time to put it all back together on
the table right use all the molecular
biology and the tools we know to go hunt
for the cure for aging all this is not
going to slow down evolution it&#39;s not
you&#39;re going to increase evolutionary
speed right cuz the olden days we needed
hardware to be able to select
preferences for blue flu or red pill
because everything was hardwired but now
that we have a brain and we can use
memes and ideas as a way to acquire
traits it&#39;s more important to live so
historically Darwinian evolution relied
on the death of individuals as a way to
innovate for hardware innovation we need
to die for software innovation we have
to live right now we&#39;re accumulating all
these memes and yet we&#39;re dying
so we&#39;re shoveling all this knowledge to
the next generation through school and
books no it&#39;s actually much better if
you just continue living and living
healthier lives stuff so the end of
senescence is actually the human destiny
it&#39;s the evolutionary destiny okay
so what are the things that you can do
right now while we&#39;re waiting for
scientists to figure all this stuff out
you guys ready for this this is your
prescription for a functional longevity
you can
are doing today okay how many people
here have spent a day surfing or being
out of the beach and they get tired at
night how many people to experience that
okay seriously here&#39;s the ball do you
need to know
sunlight suppresses melatonin and you
get the return of melatonin a night
every species in nature history lived in
ambient light day night variation were
the first species to cover ourselves
during the day with indoor jobs sunblock
sunglasses clothes and at night instead
of enjoying the darkness we put on all
the lights
we&#39;re losing the dynamic range we&#39;re
actually losing functional capacity
let&#39;s actually do the other thing let&#39;s
increase our dynamic range you know
right now if you stay away from the Sun
you actually D buffer your capacity to
be able to helm them so we always have
the perfect amount of melanin in our
skin and now that we&#39;re staying away
from it is why we get some burns and
other types of skin diseases where the
first pieces did not live in ambient
temperature every species out there
lived in 40 degrees 100 degrees they&#39;re
brown fat to heat them up their cooling
mechanisms were the first species that&#39;s
trying to stay 70 degrees all the time
we&#39;re trying to narrow our dynamic range
right we put on clothes we have HVAC
systems we moved to California
your Bloods not fitting when you move to
California losing dynamic range one of
my clients said you know my wife can
tell the difference between 69 and 71
that&#39;s a disaster but you&#39;re supposed to
handle everything so spend more time in
cold weather and spent time in altitude
spend time in depths stretch your range
spend time in the desert this is my son
and his friends at Burning Man and okay
it&#39;s not exercise all the lifestyle
recommendations out there are half right
they got half of a right exercise is
good but it&#39;s about variation and
exercise different routines therefore
time of day different muscle groups
different pace I mean running a marathon
is fine but what happened to the first
guy that ran 26.2 miles he died right so
think about variations of exercise
rather than static exercise but now that
you think about increasing homeostatic
capacity increase your dynamic range
there&#39;s now a new idea you can think
about which is that you can get above
normal healthy because right now
everything about health is getting back
to healthy no what do you think about
homeostatic capacity you can have
above baseline you can have more health
than you were born with this is gonna
transform the way we think about help
athletes already doing it again
ergonomic and neutral that&#39;s reducing
dynamic range right we know what happens
if you put your leg in a cast you
actually lose muscle what you should do
is the opposite instead of ergonomic and
neutral you should be stretching your
dynamic range flexion and extension
again it our eyes have the ability to
see things that are six inches away and
30 miles away right you can see it you
have incredible dynamic range how we use
in those eyes 18 inches in front of us
all day long
we&#39;re losing dynamic great stretch that
dynamic range okay so that last lady
look a little stress but chronic stress
is what&#39;s bad well I accept that but the
answer to that isn&#39;t meditation or
sleeping which is what we&#39;re told sleep
and meditate more that&#39;s all good stuff
but what I&#39;m here to tell you is it&#39;s
actually that and alternating with
something exhilarating right don&#39;t just
meditate do something exciting
it&#39;s the variation that matters it&#39;s not
meditation or asleep it&#39;s the change
increase your dynamic range again
there&#39;s so much news out there and
recommendations about food eat this eat
that eat that I&#39;m here to tell you the
exact opposite I&#39;m here to tell you to
eat a dynamic range of diet it&#39;s okay to
eat healthy but if you keep doing that
you&#39;re gonna lose metabolic capacity so
fine if you eat healthy but have at
least one bag of the reader per month
otherwise you&#39;re gonna lose metabolic
capacity okay
we&#39;re supposed to have a wide range of
human experiences and we&#39;re putting
everybody on Prozac we&#39;re losing this
dynamic range stretch it out right we&#39;re
supposed to be happy and sad that&#39;s holy
okay in fact if you think about the
things that really resonate whether it&#39;s
music or the arts this is Shakespeare
and I basically do a graphical line
around the plot of Shakespeare
it basically is a dynamic range right
these are the things that really
resonate inside of us okay then if this
means you should change the way you
think about the world by having new
experiences go travel go do amazing
things go listen to interesting talks
now hang out with new people try on a
different way to look at things look at
the world upside down try on the
opposing point of view keep stretching
your mental dynamic range as well you
know go to Burning Man which will
totally throw you for a loop
I started doing improv on stage which
complete changed my perspective on on
humor I couldn&#39;t find any pictures on
the internet and this one
and your thing that really helps is
laughter laughter dramatically increases
their pulmonary dynamic range and that&#39;s
a gateway to health as well so this is a
really an amazing thing right I mean I
think we&#39;re on the front end of a
revolution in longevity Sciences if
we&#39;re able to successfully increase
homeostatic capacity we&#39;re gonna unleash
human capacity but while we&#39;re waiting
for all that the good news is that the
Gateway to your personal longevity the
Gateway to increasing your functional
longevity isn&#39;t eating more broccoli
like we were told when we&#39;re young it&#39;s
actually doing more the things you
already love doing more time in the Sun
more time sleeping more time meditating
more time riding roller coasters more
time skiing spending time in that desert
meeting with interesting people eating
different kinds of food trying on new
ideas learning more having more sex
laughing more these are all things we
love doing and that actually is the best
news of all thank you so much
[Applause]
