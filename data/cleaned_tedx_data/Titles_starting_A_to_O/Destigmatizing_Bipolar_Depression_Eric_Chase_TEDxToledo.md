stigma with mental health not for me
hopelessness and helplessness yes that&#39;s
me one in five American adults suffer
from some kind of mental illness one in
25 American adults suffer from a severe
mental illness things like schizophrenia
dark depression ridden PTSD
schizophrenia and and much much worse
I&#39;m bipolar 2 type 2 it&#39;s a lesser form
of the disorder I don&#39;t get manic I
don&#39;t have mania I don&#39;t have like sex
rampages or I don&#39;t spend my time at the
casino gambling my savings away I know
that sounds like fun shit I kind of wish
I had that stuff but then I&#39;d be broke I
do get hypomania it&#39;s it&#39;s a lesser form
of all that stuff it&#39;s you&#39;re actually
seeing it right now how does it look
does it look good good I get creative
bursts of energy I&#39;ll talk really fast I
would talk with my hands if not for
having the clicker and the microphone
here I do get the depression part of
bipolar really bad I get anxiety I get
some OCD and if this is gonna make you
leave now is the time I get suicidal
thoughts this is that&#39;s not funny to
laugh at sir it&#39;s not curable how fun is
that it is very treatable we&#39;re gonna
talk about that it&#39;s apocryphal you can
give me the credit for it though
Shakespeare Picasso is what you&#39;ll find
if you google it they say the meaning of
life is to find your gift and the
purpose of life is to give that gift
away I hope my gift here today is to
empower you and your loved ones to talk
about mental health without stigma let&#39;s
jump back in to the early 2000s this is
a good Ash life right straight off my
myspace page it was the early 2000s I
was living and working in Orlando my
radio career was going exactly where I
wanted it to go I was doing a morning
show down there Orlando great place to
live in vacation and all that
morning show great music got the
interview cool artists my hours I was at
the pool by 11 a.m. the pool took a nap
there went to the gym it was a wonderful
life my career trajectory was right
where I needed it to be on the weekends
I knew a guy named DJ Jake he was
essentially and we all had this friend
he was the social mayor of Orlando Eye
with DJ and host clubs and parties with
him on Friday and Saturday nights I
would drink for free
do the deejaying thing hang out and hook
up with really good-looking people I
mean it&#39;s good work for a
twenty-something and I was able to have
it and here&#39;s where it gets scary there
would be some Friday or Saturday nights
again I&#39;m twenty-something at this point
early 20s and I would call Jake up and
saying I don&#39;t think I can make it
tonight and he&#39;d be totally
understanding I didn&#39;t understand it but
there was something shackling me from
the inside as to why it wasn&#39;t shyness
or introversion I just I couldn&#39;t go and
he was totally understanding of that
will will jump ahead a little bit and
we&#39;ll go talk about my inner Web MD
which whether you like Star Trek or Star
Wars was on hyperdrive or warp speed
when I was a little bit older my mid-20s
living and working in Saginaw I enjoyed
working there with the people made some
lifelong friendships living in Saginaw
we got it really good here where we&#39;re
at I would have these strange bouts of
questions like did my social and sexual
decisions in my recent past well did
that wreck my liver or when it got
really bad did I perhaps heavy as yet
unidentified
STD cancer aids hybrid I hadn&#39;t been to
the dentist in like five years so I just
assumed my teeth would begin to fall out
one by one by one and mind you there
were no symptoms
this all culminated this medical drama
that puts that up that show with Ellen
Pompeii to shame with a real ailment
something in my chest here this anytime
I would adjust anything mostly liquids
it would feel like it would make Pompeii
look like a match was flickering out and
I just assumed it was kind of like the
first of many heart attacks or heart
problems anyway this is all up here I
called my dad who is who is my rock with
things and I was totally panicked and my
dad still is my rock and I basically
alluded to having a heart attack my
dad&#39;s like hold on a second like I mean
the dad would say how long has this been
going on and I&#39;m like two weeks he&#39;s
like well okay well congratulations
you&#39;re having the longest heart attack
in human history turns out it was like
acid reflux and as you might have
guessed where this is all going some
volcanic levels of anxiety and this was
on the days when I didn&#39;t feel like I
was depressed I was down I was sad and
there was no reason like life was good
sex was good my dog was good my friend
work everything was good so it was one
or the other and I would call these like
the beginning of my emotional valleys so
I wasn&#39;t averse to it I&#39;d been to a
therapist the counselor in Orlando dr.
Mary Leakey she&#39;s probably dead now but
she was very helpful I don&#39;t know why I
went I don&#39;t know how she helped but she
did in fact so much so that when DJ Jake
called me and said hey can I can I talk
to somebody okay she helped him too so
now we&#39;re in the summer of 2005 and
again I decided to go back to a
counselor these emotional valleys had
become too much I explained to her what
was going on she said I was a creative
type intelligent and I&#39;m thankful to
have those two traits thanks to all this
up here and what was going on but I
expressed like low energy anxiety I
didn&#39;t want to socialize if I did and to
this day my friends were in the room can
attest to this I would be hesitant to
make plans because when it would time
would come to do the plans well Erik
wouldn&#39;t exactly be there or if he would
he&#39;d only be there for 10 minutes and
then gone the other thing that anybody
who has suffered from any kind of
depression can sympathize with I didn&#39;t
want to get out of bed I had to though
we have to get out of bed when I did get
out of bed
I counted the minutes and seconds for
getting back into bed
not because my bed was safe but because
I could go to sleep and four six seven
eight hours this mysterious melancholy
was not anything I was thinking about
she digested all this it said okay I got
this bipolar too before the happy emoji
even came around I was completely
completely elated I was sitting down
like this and then I literally got up
and and cheered it&#39;s like I won the
Super Ball pour the damn Gatorade on me
and she&#39;s like well that&#39;s not exactly
the reaction I get when I tell somebody
they&#39;ve got a mental illness I said
you&#39;ve never met me before I was truly
elated
this was the best day of my life and it
still is because I being endlessly
curious knew who the enemy was
I put my son&#39;s ooh art of war hat on
that I made at home and I said I&#39;m gonna
do whenever I know how to do besides
going to therapy to beat this foe books
you can laugh if you want cognitive
behavioral therapy for dummies I went
and bought this book and this other one
right here this feeling good handbook it
is what I call my my psychology Bible
it&#39;s the best piece of this I&#39;ve ever
read and both of these books and more
offered me some very easy to digest
practical applicable things that I was
almost immediately able to improve what
was going on with me I didn&#39;t care the
social cost I felt like shit and I
didn&#39;t know why but I knew why I just
wanted to feel better some of these
these books and others taught me certain
techniques like what&#39;s the worst that
could happen I mean this doesn&#39;t get me
anxious I enjoy doing this but what&#39;s
the worst can happen if you came up here
and if I called you up here to talk
right now
they blew you off you nothing on
flooding and immersion good for anxiety
or things you&#39;re scared of because
they&#39;re often irrational immerse
yourself flood yourself with what you&#39;re
afraid of and once you see that it&#39;s
irrational and sit through it sweat it
out you&#39;ll see it was irrational it will
have gone away the last one
fortune-telling we all do this
especially if there&#39;s something not
right up here where the chemicals are
wrong
with me we predict what we think will
happen it&#39;s usually bad the other thing
that we do is we think we know how we
will react to bad situations two years
ago if you would have told me I was
gonna get fired and I&#39;d probably be
three sideways to Saturday not knowing
what I was gonna do with myself Oh guess
what I got fired and I&#39;m up here right
now
these very applicable techniques helped
me immensely look at it this way if I
were to fall off the stage right now
that would be embarrassing I&#39;d probably
be hurt too but if you strain something
if you think you broke something if
you&#39;ve got a call forever that was not
calling you out but if it gets real
Flemmi we we&#39;re unfortunately
conditioned to to haul ass that first
we&#39;re gonna post about it on Facebook
then we&#39;re gonna haul ass to the doctor
and we&#39;re maybe we&#39;re gonna go to Urgent
Care 24/7 because now especially here
where we live I can get to an urgent
care faster than I can find a Starbucks
and that&#39;s saying something why why do
we address that so quickly but not
what&#39;s up here because of stigma of
course and usually what&#39;s up here
shrouds our judgment and obfuscates our
happiness I&#39;m the one in five I
mentioned but there&#39;s a lot of dark
times where I inch closer to the one in
twenty five the severe stuff I&#39;ll tell
you about a time I was living and
working in Allentown again jobs going
really well I was an hour from home
originally from Philadelphia and I&#39;m
driving on a highway called 22 I called
my dad I was in one of these emotional
valleys so my dad knew where I was on
the other end of the phone and I felt
helpless I wanted to escape I was
exasperated feeling like this and I said
to my dad dad I don&#39;t care right now if
my car careened into the median I want
this to end
there were silence on the other end of
the phone had I jerked the wheel there
would have been silence on my end of the
phone and from that moment forward I
resolved no matter how bleak things were
I couldn&#39;t go through with that 90% of
suicides are connected
if suicide bothers you I suggest you
leave right now because I&#39;m gonna say
some pretty challenging things to what
you think about this 90% of suicides are
connected to mental health the other 10%
I like to say you will little Tony a lot
of money I&#39;m working on that joke I
swear working on that one I&#39;m working on
that one all right so go back to the
90/10 thing um healthy minded people
when everything is working right up here
don&#39;t get out of bed enjoy a day like
this go to the gym come home and go you
know what I&#39;m gonna blow my fucking
brains out today that&#39;s the disease
that&#39;s the illness talking I like I said
if ever resolved never to do that
although I have had suicidal thoughts
and I immediately think back to my dad
I&#39;ve wanted to escape this darkness
before thankfully I haven&#39;t gone through
with it I don&#39;t know where I think I go
not a religious person maybe where I
would go is worse
I don&#39;t know I&#39;m here so I haven&#39;t been
there I know that you don&#39;t come back
the emotional shrapnel that flies from
committing that act is unconscionable
the emotional collateral damage that you
caused from that selfish act to escape
whatever it is is unthinkable but we
don&#39;t talk about this stuff you don&#39;t
talk about it I do
it&#39;s stigmatized for most people we&#39;re
not where we need to be
we&#39;re not pre Freudian times anymore
we&#39;re not in the 1950s there is no
vehicle outside that&#39;s gonna say Eric
you got to come with us back in the
straitjacket I&#39;m not going back to any
asylum and yes the shirt I didn&#39;t dress
up because of the meeting here the
duality of this all I&#39;m not going back
to an asylum we don&#39;t call him that
anymore
I&#39;m not going to be institutionalized no
one&#39;s going to take me after this and
cut my skull open and take out parts of
my brain we don&#39;t do that anymore all
these words right here if I were to go
to a psychological professional a
counselor for the very first time and
sat down and explained all the things
I&#39;m telling you guys
they&#39;re not gonna say I&#39;m psycho or mad
or a weirdo crazy a lunatic none of
those words are gonna get used I do my
best to take them out of my daily
lexicon especially in this context let&#39;s
do a little exercise what&#39;s the worst
that could happen from a couple of
minutes ago if you may be inspired by me
here today or someone else who talks
about this stuff you want to talk to a
friend about some depressive feelings
maybe some dark ones one of two things
is likely to happen very they&#39;re gonna
say what can I do to get you some help
I&#39;ve heard about free resources like
Nami we&#39;re gonna get you there right
away or they&#39;re gonna say you&#39;re crazy
let&#39;s have a drink and we&#39;ll get over it
they&#39;re either not as close as you
thought or they&#39;re ignorant to where
we&#39;re going with mental health and
raising more and more awareness I told
you this isn&#39;t curable but a damn sure
is treatable it&#39;s why I&#39;m standing here
today the other bad news is it&#39;s often
progressive as it gets stronger I you
have to get stronger just like we work
out of the gym to get stronger or faster
we got to work out up here we got to get
more educated we got to follow the
science the imaging is getting better so
we can better diagnose these therapists
I&#39;ve been to a lot of them the one I
have right now is absolutely incredible
you might not click with the first or
second one but the right one is out
there when you decide to seek the help
or help for that person employers ask
about EAP programs Employee Assistance
Programs they give you like three five
seven confidential visits obviously free
visits so you can find the right person
I like to relate counselors and therapy
to dating you date a lot of different
people before you find that&#39;s that
person that you&#39;re going to spend a long
time with because they understand how
you think how you talk
maybe you connect better with someone of
the opposite sex or the same sex
medications this has been the most
trying part of all of this for me
because the side effects you&#39;ve heard
and read all about them
one medication that I thought was
working it lifted my depression but in
the middle of the day I was sedated so I
was depressed from wanting to go to bed
at 8 o&#39;clock different dosages
experimentation what works combinations
it&#39;s challenging I&#39;m not gonna lie to
you about that it&#39;s tough in fact right
now what I&#39;m on is cymbalta
I was on wellbutrin for a very long time
I didn&#39;t know that cymbalta which was
suggested to me by a friend for some
chronic pain was going to work better I
just stumbled on to it not only is it
squashed laying my depression but it is
completely quelled any of my anxiety as
well and I stumbled onto it so stick
with it I assure you the daily struggle
will be less of one my dogs are my
therapy the gym is my therapy doing this
is my therapy I&#39;ve got to know my
triggers like stress which we can&#39;t
avoid I&#39;ve got to watch out for the
cloud but the triggers one is alcohol
don&#39;t let this stop you from drinking
here today and have a good time I&#39;ve got
to limit my alcohol which is difficult
because I like to drink for two reasons
one it&#39;s a depressant two it inhibits my
medication ability to do what it&#39;s
supposed to do it fuels that cloud that
cloud gets bigger and stronger when I
ask myself some existential questions
about life like maybe I shouldn&#39;t be
doing radio or Facebook live for my
living room maybe I should go home and
live with my dad and Philadelphia maybe
I should say fu to their hurricanes I&#39;m
going to live in the tropics the more
outlandish those questions get the
bigger that cloud is that cloud is not
filled with rain or nudes or dick pecks
a couple of dick pics it&#39;s filled with
have a creaking depression so how do I
fight it off how do I move it away from
me get back into a routine get your ass
up and go to the gym take the dogs for a
longer walk if it&#39;s really serious
go see your therapist maybe your
medications need to be changed it says
stay in bed it says don&#39;t socialize it
says have a couple more drinks I&#39;ve got
to do the opposite of what it&#39;s telling
me to do so that I can shrink it and
push it away for one more day I know we
were talking superhero as earlier with
Alex&#39;s stuff I wish I was a superhero I
mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a good job good hours
they&#39;re usually rich I&#39;m down with
wearing a cape and a costume you get
pretty girls you get to beat up bad guys
there&#39;s really very little bad stuff
about it
I don&#39;t have a single traditional
superpower but I can stand up here and
talk about mental health without stigma
and you can talk about mental health
without stigma as well
it is cathartic it is medicinal I told
you how my mind has concocted some
insidious and I thought fatal diseases
I have shunned responsibilities and jobs
and friends and relationships I have
thought about what the world my dad and
my dogs would be like without me in it
but I&#39;m still here because I&#39;ve armed
myself with everything that I talked
about the free roofs resources like Nami
your counselors our EAP by dog you could
do the same as we wrap up here do me a
couple of favors in those darkest hours
know that you&#39;re not alone there&#39;s
millions of us there&#39;s millions of me
but to end in those dark and hopeless
and helpless of times remember those two
key root words help and hope they are
there for you I&#39;m happy of two to have
been as well
and thank you
you
[Applause]
