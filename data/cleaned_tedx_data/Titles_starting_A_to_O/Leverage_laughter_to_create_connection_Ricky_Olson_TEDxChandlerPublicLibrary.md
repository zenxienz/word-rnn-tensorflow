this last June my wife and I celebrated
our 26th wedding anniversary that&#39;s okay
you can applaud its if you knew me you
knew it was a big deal when I tell
people that they have two questions the
first question is how did you meet and
it&#39;s hard for me to imagine that it&#39;s
been 26 years because it feels like just
yesterday when our eyes locked across
the room I knew immediately what I
wanted so I walked right up to her but I
couldn&#39;t speak thankfully she broke the
ice and said welcome to McDonald&#39;s may I
take your order it&#39;s like a voice of an
angel I couldn&#39;t speak I just pointed
out the board grunted she said number
one Big Mac fries and a coke you want to
supersize that it was like she knew me
but when she said I&#39;ll have that right
out for you sir it was then that I knew
that she knew it was her job to serve me
I could never say that with a straight
face especially when she&#39;s in the room
in 1972 Victor Borge said laughter is
the shortest distance between two people
so thank you for laughing 35 years later
modern neuroscience and functional MRI
scans are proving what Victor knew
intuitively that laughter is more than
amusement laughter his affiliation
agreement and affection laughter is
connection British neuroscientist Sophie
Scott said that laughter is a positive
social signal that I like you I agree
with you and I&#39;m in the same group with
you laughter is connection so if there&#39;s
one thing to remember from our time
together is that laughter is connection
today I&#39;m going to share with you how
you can create a laughter rich
environment so that you can connect
through laughter the first ingredient is
you need to laugh at yourself when you
laugh at yourself you connect to your
own humanity
you&#39;ve heard this saying laugh and the
world laughs with you chew with your
mouth open and you&#39;ll eat alone
yesterday I found myself at Whole Foods
around lunchtime which was very
convenient the door is open and I could
immediately smell the hot food bar as if
as like a sirens call beckoning me I
find myself at the hot food bar and as I
wake make my way up to the bar I see one
sign in particular catches my attention
vegan meatballs
let me say that again vegan meatballs
I&#39;m thinking am I being Punk&#39;d I had to
laugh because you may have guessed I
have some food issues well I&#39;ve got a
lot of food issues but but I&#39;m also very
literal so I don&#39;t know if I can eat
vegan meatballs and I laughed even more
because I got to thinking about myself
as a vegan or vegetarian and if you are
that&#39;s great but I just know with my
literal mentality I would not be able to
eat meat but I would avoid meat in any
form I wouldn&#39;t be happy to meet you I
wouldn&#39;t meet you halfway
I wouldn&#39;t meet you for lunch I wouldn&#39;t
join meetup comm I wouldn&#39;t go to meet
and greet and you would never see me at
a swap meet I would be so afraid of
anything with a hint of animal I
couldn&#39;t give a piggyback ride
couldn&#39;t horse around bear hug out of
the question and I would have to quit
picking out that one would be hard for
me to do I don&#39;t think I could just quit
cold-turkey
and that is a lot of puns my friends the
first ingredient of a laughter rich
environment is to laugh at your own
situation your own circumstances because
when you laugh at yourself you connect
to your own humanity the second
ingredient is to laugh with others you
are 30 times more likely to laugh when
you&#39;re in a group of people plus you&#39;re
going to try to make eye contact with
the person whose connection you value
most Martha Beck author said that
laughter is social glue that binds
people together and fills the small gaps
that inevitably remain that&#39;s connection
who do you spend the most time with who
do you love to laugh with I mentioned
earlier that people have two questions
about being married 26 years the second
question is what&#39;s the secret to a happy
marriage now I look them straight in the
eye and say I have no idea
all right just check and see if y&#39;all
are with me on the laughter
I have no idea that&#39;s just a joke but
here&#39;s the real answer don&#39;t fight we
are one of those couples that never
fight ever about anything well yeah
there&#39;s one thing and that&#39;s the fact
that she wants to go places and see
things and I want to see things too I
just don&#39;t want to have to leave home to
do it I&#39;ve got the internet and I&#39;ve got
cable I&#39;ve got the couch you can google
anything right for example last
Christmas she said I want to go see the
giant Christmas tree and anthem honey
how do you know there&#39;s a giant
Christmas tree an anthem I saw it in the
paper
okay so you&#39;ve seen it now here&#39;s the
real secret to 26 year marriage next
thing I know like that we&#39;re up in
Anthem looking at the giant Christmas
tree and it&#39;s nice and I found myself
getting a little nostalgic thinking way
back to before in the paper you look
just like it
when we moved to Phoenix she said I want
to go see the view from South Mountain
so I pulled it up on Google I said there
you go honey hiker girl 33 it&#39;s already
done the work that&#39;s not what I want I
don&#39;t want a picture I want to see it
for myself
so she drugged me up South Mountain now
I wasn&#39;t drugged but I wish I&#39;d been
drugged and let&#39;s face it it&#39;s not
hiking it&#39;s climbing and it&#39;s hot and I
am sweaty and thirsty and tired and
angry and a bit of a whiny pants that&#39;s
right I said it
that&#39;s why we don&#39;t have kids because I
am one but we get to the top and the
first thing she does when we get to the
top any guesses she took a picture you
want to see it honey oh yeah look at
that it looks like before at home when I
wasn&#39;t hot and sweaty and thirsty and
tired and angry in Hawaii pants and she
said you have to admit it&#39;s not the same
it is to me and now she&#39;s upset and
rightfully so because I&#39;ve ruined her
trip to South Mountain on the way home
we&#39;re driving you want to go get some
ice cream no answer you want to go get
some ice cream no answer now as my head
turns for the third time she thrusts her
phone into my face there&#39;s your ice
cream tubby
it&#39;s a picture of a banana split and it
was then that I realized she&#39;s right
some things you need to really
experience a picture is not worth those
thousand words
the other thing you need to experience
is shared laughter because when you
create that moment you create an
opportunity to in an instant transport
yourself back to that moment and regain
those benefits but also to regain that
connection the first ingredient is laugh
at yourself the second is to laugh with
others and the third is make others
laugh
Lauren Martin said that those who make
us laugh are more than just our friends
they may just be our saviors back in
2000 my mother was passing away with
cancer it made for a long difficult time
for both of us but I wanted to honor
what she wanted as far as her
arrangements I wanted I said mom tell me
what you want I want to do what you want
done but she wouldn&#39;t have that
conversation with me she avoided it at
every turn
finally I slipped into her bedroom sat
on the edge of her bed and with the TV
glow illuminating our conversation I
said I want to do this will you tell me
she wouldn&#39;t answer and I said finally
you know me if you don&#39;t tell me what
you want I will have you stuffed and put
in a rocking chair and as we&#39;ve grown
accustomed to by now her response was
Ricky
that was her typical response to my
inappropriate comments but we shared a
laugh in a very difficult time and I got
to help her
connect to her own humanity we connected
together in it to this day it&#39;s one of
my fondest memories of that difficult
time the three ingredients till after
rich environment laugh at yourself you
connect to your own humanity laugh with
others because it&#39;s social glue it binds
us together make others laugh because
you just may be their Savior but
everything I&#39;ve shared up till now
doesn&#39;t really matter as much as this
point as you leave here today who do you
need to laugh with what situation in
your life do you need to laugh about and
who do you need to make laugh because if
you want to connect you need to laugh
but if you really want to connect share
a banana split
