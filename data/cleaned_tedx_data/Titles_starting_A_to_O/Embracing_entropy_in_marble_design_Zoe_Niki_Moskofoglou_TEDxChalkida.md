nanostick Rica um so hello everyone
thank you for being here we are sisters
I am so in Nikki and we are the founders
and designers of marble studio on
entropy our relationship with marble has
started a long time ago
so looking into family photo albums
there was a lot of traveling and island
hopping exploring rocky landscapes and
quarries and different mineral
formations that they were so bright that
it was often I heard things we were
getting blind and blinded by their
whiteness and then there was more rocks
and occasionally Nikki and mum and Zoe
in the photos so indeed marble has
played a key role in our development or
in the Greek term excelling as has
entropy
I understand how entropy and marble
might not be quite easy to understand
the relationship with but I was always
fascinated by this term so we start with
my personal experience with entropy and
the best moment in my life was when I
had my son and
there must be a few working mothers here
so life had changed completely
I was oscillating between order and
disorder I was living in an organized
beautiful cares so like things had
accepted a lot had changed a lot and I
was very after all the existential
issues and queer queries I started
looking to them term entropy and what it
meant meant to be in order and disorder
and the theory of chaos a really so at
the same time I was working for an
architect&#39;s practice designing a marble
architectural columns very interesting
at the time being I was very familiar
with the material from my teenage years
and I found it quite challenging turning
it quite hard and called material into
calm or even an item like that so for me
marble triggered this kind of chaotic
feeling so that was it I had realized
there was a relationship between the two
and I kind of lifetime on ongoing as a
project started so over the years
together with my sister Zoe and with
lots of love discipline oscillating many
times between chaos and order and
ordering cares and we got to develop
this mental toolkit and quite practical
at some point on how to deal with
challenging materials or situations so
today we will talk about life evolution
XL exists through our eyes into our
marble world and so this is not going to
be talk about geology or physics it will
be about notions of understanding and
relating experiencing and learning and
creativity so ultimately x alex is by
design
so let&#39;s start from the basics and let&#39;s
get you involved a little bit so how
many of you know what marble is I
suppose a lot of Greeks we have in the
audience of course yes marble and then
how about entropy or any people familiar
with yes okay that&#39;s encouraging more
than what I was expecting so that&#39;s good
so starting with marble it is a
metamorphic rock that means that it has
been formed inside the earth under very
high temperatures and very high
pressures for long long time millions of
years while it&#39;s been formed
discontinuities in the rock developed
that appear like these trucks these are
physical discontinuities but then there
are also chemical discontinuities like
these which form because of different
minerals been deposited there for a very
very long time and forming these
beautiful veins now the reason why we
mention this is that other than their
aesthetic value these are the weak
points in marble these are the breaking
points and this is something that it&#39;s
very crucial in our work as you will see
later on but first to immerse you in our
world of marble this video which is a
video yes it is a video indeed and it
was and I think a lovely Saiki see Zak
can do a little bit about the music
because it has a really nice music
behind well still we can do without the
music it was you can you can imagine it
visualize it it&#39;s a very nice piece by
many we&#39;ve all done a bit of ballet no
so this this film was shot in the quarry
of yoni sauce which is located in the
mountain / Delhi but then it&#39;s a very
cult very important landscape because
it&#39;s a cultural landscape and that&#39;s
because this is where all marble for all
major works of antiquity came from so
the parthenon marbles the marbles at
works exported to Pompeii but what we
look here at the moment is the current
and active site on the opposite side of
Benelli at be honest which see it&#39;s it&#39;s
active obviously the reason one it&#39;s
protected is an ecological site so as
you move into this store you get a bit
of a daunting feeling originally because
you move from a place which is very
bright into a darker place and as you
see as you move up it&#39;s quite a big holy
literally what it is it&#39;s a huge hole
into the mountain this height as you go
up from the very bottom all the way up
it&#39;s about 40 meters high so to give you
a bit of a scale to this if I was to be
standing there I would be between there
and there
it&#39;s a huge enormous place and it gives
you that feeling almost metaphysical and
probably for the right reasons because
one day one way or the other we will all
eventually end up back there
you know huge marble home for eternity
[Music]
so yes it&#39;s I mean it&#39;s a very important
place in the reason this particular
quarry that it&#39;s still active you can
see daily just there the opposite
it&#39;s where the place that marble is
sourced for all the current important
architectural landmarks including the
Opera House the National Opera House by
Renzo Piano as well as international
projects in India the Baha&#39;i temple
marble is sourced from there so it&#39;s if
you ever get the chance it&#39;s a really
unique place to visit
so moving on with entropy now this is a
term that it&#39;s been defined in many
disciplines that range from
thermodynamics and systems fear in
mathematics to psychology and it&#39;s a
term that it&#39;s puzzling even to
scientists and that&#39;s because of the
many interpretations that it has so
today we do not expect that you will
leave this talk knowing all about
entropy but what we do hope is that you
will get to understand how entropy is a
source of inspiration and how it helped
us evolve so before getting into the
very specifics just to take a step back
and appreciate that it is so important
entropy which falls into the second law
of thermodynamics it&#39;s that important
that ignorance of which the second law
of thermodynamics is equivalent to never
have read a work by Shakespeare now
this big statement and and and probably
for the right reasons because what
entropy does I mean I still haven&#39;t got
there what entropy is but I promise I
will get there in a minute
what entropy does it measure it explains
it sets a basis to why any change occurs
in life and by any we don&#39;t just mean
how engines run but why Nina Simone has
been feeling good and has made us feel
good and has done all this great work
from her music work that she has
refocused it into her fight for civil
rights entropy is behind literature it&#39;s
everywhere because what entropy is
eventually a measure of change so to
make it a little bit more tangible we
will see its etymology that it comes
from the word and which sees means
inside and throw P which means a
tourniquet transformation so it&#39;s an
internal transformation and to make it
now tangible we will look at this
example of how an ice cube when it
interacts with the environment
it melts pretty straightforward there&#39;s
a temperature difference heat flows and
it melts now trying to reverse this
process and this is where entropy comes
in if we were in a lab in an idealized
scenario it would be quite
straightforward but in any real process
and at the level where we are working
and in any real-life case scenario that
wouldn&#39;t be easy
mainly because processes in life are
irreversible because they&#39;re not a
hundred percent efficient as you move on
in life there are losses I mean in this
example it was energy loss to the
environment it was heat it can be
friction in life we lose patients we
lose our temper so many other things and
as we move on from a very order state to
a more free state and more chaotic state
the entropy increases so at the more
personal level probably that was my head
back in my early 20s a very structured
civil engineer with all the boxes set
out clearly very safe and and as I
evolved and grew out of my 20s and as I
appreciated that life can be chaotic
this is more of me having a well not as
chaotic but having appreciated that and
an embrace that chaos is there so back
to marble how we bring the two together
that was entropy and I hope you have at
least four the sense of it so how do we
put the two together marble and drop in
what we do it up in a physical sense so
we take marble from the earth which sits
there in a very stable position it took
millions of years for it to be informed
so it&#39;s entropy is very low we extract
it from the earth we square it in two
big volumes and then we shape it into
smaller ones we finish it by hand into a
refined object whose entropy we have
increased also in our designs we like to
introduce light which doesn&#39;t change the
structure configuration of marble
obviously but it changes the field
making it more airy and light and
finally we like to hang our marble
creations invoking a more floating
feeling if you like
so probably I&#39;ve had quite a bit of me
and of science and now Mickey is going
to give us another perspective of marble
and entropy so looking to the cultural
values embedded in marble and entropy
what we would like to do is continue
this entropic process through marble to
the cultural values embedded so looking
back in history this is the first
evidence of marble found in Greece 4000
years ago
it&#39;s the prehistoric Cycladic I know it
symbolizing fertility and it was a means
for the religious and spiritual
expression 2,000 years later the carry
artist
a female sculpture that was acting as an
architectural element as support is
nowadays historic and architectural icon
today through our work we are hoping
that we can add quite tiny remark at the
contemporary phase interpretation of
marble but how actually did we do this
as mentioned before marble is a brittle
material and it&#39;s a characterized but by
it&#39;s quite a high breaking point and
this can often be it can be seen often
as obstacles in design but I would like
to see them as challenges
it looks very strong it&#39;s a solid rock
but when it&#39;s configuration changes it
becomes extremely fragile so when there
is an entropy increase which means it
changes from one state to the other then
there is a risk of failure and we can
see this in the video below it&#39;s one of
our designs yes you can see this is the
inherent vein which just by pulling it
this is the point where it breaks these
veins this way these are sneaky veins
that appear very very often and there&#39;s
not much you can do about it other than
accepting really that they&#39;re there so
especially in our light designs these
challenges becoming an even more
apparent because they&#39;re what we&#39;re
trying to do is to balance translucency
with rigidity what this means is that we
try to make marble feel enough for light
to pass through but at the same time
strong for it
so strong so that it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t
fail we don&#39;t want any more able to fail
and it hasn&#39;t of course 3000 of course
and but in the process of doing that in
every new design this means a lot of
experimentation a lot of trial and error
and however much you have studied marble
and however many calculations you&#39;ve
done I&#39;ve done then it fails because now
marble is a natural material and in
these cracks are coming where you do not
expect so imagine how the civil
engineering inside me feels when this
happens but it&#39;s it&#39;s part of the
process it&#39;s something we have learned
to accept so similarly in life in the
life that you can change to the next as
them you anthropologist Bateson stated
and there is a tendency of things to get
into a model and we have seen a lot of
model in quarries and this is actually
the floor of a quarry sewing in a few
minutes sorry so and this is actually
one of our newest investigation turning
and marble dust into items so you cannot
control everything and what we do is
with that we accept that with every new
design there things might not work the
way we wanted them to work and seem
things simply break and I guess it&#39;s the
same with us we&#39;ve all reached our
breaking points but that&#39;s ok because
there is something quiet available in
this experience so we&#39;ll be quiet we&#39;ve
become quite comfortable with mess so we
decided that and we did in the project
we did last year at Somerset House at
the London Design Biennale we embrace
the weak points of the marble and we
exposed the natural beauty and the same
inherit cracks and in a way of
celebrating nature in the material but
also celebrating life so why have these
entropic aspects and have been
important for us and what have we gained
so we&#39;ve developed our toolkit and I can
give you a small a few words that you
can pull out in them obtained in life
so understanding the relationship of
these two concepts have been very
important to us because it&#39;s a driving
force for our Creeper creativity and
evolution so in this toolkit we have
experimentation we have investigation
where we have research of the
challenging materials and situations but
love lots of love and passion we
understand that living in the
uncontrolled world has this got a
certain level of uncertainty and chaos
and it&#39;s okay to oscillate between order
and disorder as long as some kind of
discipline and failure of course and I
would like to think that when we are
conscious of the project of the of the
project the process of design as well
and the process of life there is room
and space for transformation and even
more there is no real failure but only
evolution so essentially this is how we
evolve by embracing mess and concluding
we would like to think that we have
encourage you also to think that through
any rigid and solid situation you can
transform it into something light full
of brightest in life when indeed life
can be messy but sorry miss I keep not
being very so yes I think we run out of
battery so this is quite anthropic in
that state as well
thank you fucker yes and this 30 days
that this is the last one yes so yes
this is a life&#39;s messiness this happen
right now
and 1/4 of us in the quiet in metres
high and as sometimes in life the more
entropic they&#39;re more evolutionary and
even though we&#39;re it in metres high as
long as we are safe and together we&#39;re
evolving thank you again
