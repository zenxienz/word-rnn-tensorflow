thank you all for being here today it&#39;s
working it&#39;s such a pleasure being here
today I&#39;d initially thought the thought
of talking about the importance of just
entrepreneurship in high schools in
India well I started doing some research
on the Indian education system I came
across an alarming fact that switched
the tone of my talk from a common sense
a nice-to-have framework to a social and
ethical imperative I&#39;ll get straight to
the point
India has one of the highest suicide
rates among 15 to 29 year old students
in the whole world
every hour a student in India commits
suicide
and these are just the numbers reported
by the National Crime Records Bureau
take a second to let that sink in fear
of failure failure failure to cope with
exams and a sense of hopelessness were
reasons written in suicide notes
India has a world-class STEM education
but the resulting mindset of these
students is the antithesis of what a
world-class education should yield does
this not urge us to ask why a 15 year
old would feel these extreme feelings of
despair and hopelessness in in their
lives find ways to end their lives when
it hasn&#39;t even really begun really
disturbed
I started thinking and then I realized
the sad truth is that most Indian kids
derive their sense of self-worth from
their grades from the time they can
barely speak they are taught that it&#39;s a
shame if their grades do not match up to
Sharma G&#39;s son or the neighbor&#39;s
daughter there he is I added this slide
for a bit of comic relief because the
reality is so not funny because with
this one single comparison we stunt a
child&#39;s ability to become the best
version of themselves instead of
striving their whole lives to be a good
enough version of someone else but this
one instant their sense of self is now
derived in reference to the next person
instead of rooting a child&#39;s identity in
their strengths we choose to focus on
their weaknesses as areas of improvement
this now sets in motion a downward
spiral of unmet expectations a
paralyzing fear of failure and an
eventual resentment of the self that
causes these students at 15 to take
their lives and these are these are
unrealistic standards set by said
virtuously by well-meaning parents and
I&#39;m being sarcastic because I&#39;m a bit
enraged we need to realize that unless
we stop this madness at home of
reinforcing good grades instead of
encouraging Allah
learning no amount of suicide hotlines
and mental health awareness campaigns in
schools is gonna have a real impact on
the mental well-being of these kids now
I was a happily mediocre student in high
school sure my parents asked me to study
and I did what I had to but if I ever
have the chance to watch cricket or do
ten minutes extra studying I would
always choose cricket being a topper a
topper was never a life goal for me
because somehow I always knew that my
life would start after school so I left
India right after my high school for my
education and I know the kind of
unlearning I had to do in order to
thrive in an environment where
understanding concepts and comprehending
ideas were encouraged over memorizing
facts were independent exchange of ideas
in original thinking were encouraged as
forms of learning there needs to be a
paradigm shift in the Indian education
system on the role of Education in our
lives on the role of educators in
society educators need to re-examine
their roles in the classroom and outside
we need to stop being figures of
authorities and start being nurturers we
need to we need to foster a culture of
mutual respect in the classrooms where
students feel just as respected as
professors where their ideas are
encouraged and their thinking is heard
only then will Indian classrooms be
foundations of real education inspiring
great ideas
now I&#39;d always known that I wanted to
study biomed so I majored in biomedical
technology explored a bit in college I
majored in biomedical technology in my
bachelor&#39;s I did not do a masters right
after my bachelor&#39;s because a master&#39;s
is not just a lead-in from a bachelor&#39;s
I did
masters when I wanted to pursue cancer
research at a good lab in the US so I
did my masters in cancer biology hoping
to do a PhD once I started working in
lab I didn&#39;t do my PhD because I
realized that I didn&#39;t love lab I didn&#39;t
feel like lab was embracing the full
range of my abilities so I did an MBA
instead and in Business School during my
entrepreneurship education at Johns
Hopkins that was the first time I felt
like I was exploring all those little
things that I always thought I was good
at my point in sharing this with you is
don&#39;t become a slave to education make
your education work for you an education
is a functional asset it&#39;s not an
ornament so please I beg you don&#39;t try
to get into Medical School
when your heart lies in the arts why
would you try to get into engineering
college when you have a natural flair
for languages in poetry and storytelling
comes naturally to you the only reason
you should spend sleepless nights
getting into IIT is if the love is your
is your love for the technological
education that IITs provide because when
that love drives your efforts it
naturally prepares you for the
challenges ahead look I&#39;m not here to
turn you into intellectual renegades who
question education or defy the
importance of it I tremendously respect
the importance of education God knows
I&#39;ve had my share if it serves your
purpose but I am here to tell you that
the role of education is not to fill
your minds with information it is to
open up your minds to the possibilities
outside the role of Education is not to
prepare you for the four walls of your
school is to prepare you for the
uncertainties waiting outside for you
once you graduate we are grossly failing
our students we are grossly failing our
youth by preparing them with these
myopic curricular
for school helping them get from one
grade to another I have a fundamental
problem with defining the vastness of
any human beings potential with one
quotient an exam score an entrance exam
score I am here to tell you to every
student here and everywhere you are not
your entrance exam score you are not
just your class rank you are not just an
engineering student and you&#39;re certainly
not just I didn&#39;t get into engineering
student I have met so many of you you
were kind you are creative you&#39;re
naturally entrepreneurial you are
anything you want to be and don&#39;t let
anybody tell you any different
we need to readjust our focus from a
weakness and needs based outlook at home
and in school to a talent and strengths
based outlook because when we focus on
our weaknesses we as a society end up
with a talent deficit economy but when
we focus on our strengths we end up with
a surplus in our strength in our talent
economy
nobody ever became super successful by
minimizing their weaknesses but they
certainly did so by leveraging their
strengths in this context
entrepreneurship education according to
me is the single most effective way to
imbibe a strengths focused Purpose
Driven outlook in life at any age
especially during our teens let&#39;s define
entrepreneurship because there seems to
be some let&#39;s demystify entrepreneurship
some people think it&#39;s just opening up a
shop or starting a business some kids
think it&#39;s just doing something cool
some parents fear that it&#39;s their kids
dropping out of school doing something
meaningless with their lives let&#39;s go
with the World Economic Forum&#39;s
definition of entrepreneurship
entrepreneurship is the ability to turn
ideas into action through the pursuit of
resources not directly in our control I
love this definition because it breaks
down a fancy French word into
comprehensible terms I want to draw your
attention to the latter half of this
definition turning ideas into reality
sure requires a skill set but through
the pursuit of resources not directly in
our control requires a mindset the
entrepreneurial mindset that requires
entrepreneurs to have certain traits
that builds them to survive the odds and
the beauty of entrepreneurship is and
here&#39;s the good news by the way
according to experts at Stanford
University entrepreneurship can be
learned take it from me because I was
not naturally entrepreneurial I learned
it and the beauty of entrepreneurship
education is through experiential
learning it helps you uncover your own
strengths it helps you discover talents
you didn&#39;t even know you had and when a
person becomes aware of something that
they&#39;re good at that thing becomes a
source of tremendous inspiration in
everything they do and view themselves
as but don&#39;t get me wrong
raw talent has very little value in the
real world so when you find that thing
you get really good at it I often say I
like to say that success is the
firstborn child of passion and practice
now I know passion is an often overused
words a lot of people say you know
passion is overrated strengths are
overrated
but in entrepreneurship when you&#39;re
starting to create something of your own
passion and strength are actually two
functional requirements for success or
at least the likelihood of it passion
because it&#39;s a great cushion for every
time you fall and you will fall it&#39;ll
get you up every morning in strength
because when you&#39;re naturally good at
something it gets far easier to excel in
that thing rather than trying to start
learning something from scratch that
doesn&#39;t come naturally to you certainly
can be done now all this talk of
passions and strengths and
entrepreneurship we&#39;re missing a key
ingredient that makes the
entrepreneurial journey or any journey
the arrival of arrival that much sweeter
uncertainty when I started when I first
started thinking about the theme for
today I asked myself what does embracing
uncertainty mean it was so beautiful
then I realized it means embracing life
is there any other way to really live
and then it dawned on me without
uncertainty there would be no hope if
you think about it it&#39;s the uncertainty
of a thing that helps us appreciate it&#39;s
very beam praying for a loved one&#39;s good
health the idea of love ever after
eternal love success in life itself if
we knew for a fact that we&#39;d live
forever if we knew for a fact marriages
were meant to last forever if we were
guaranteed success in any venture
birthdays anniversaries and celebration
of success would lose its meaning it&#39;s
the uncertainty of these journeys that
lends itself to an accomplishment just
like every success comes with the chance
of a failure so does every failure stand
the chance of turning into a tremendous
success eventually and the only way to
find out is to draw your inspiration
from your own strengths let your passion
drive your purpose in life embrace the
uncertainty of it all and do it anyway
that&#39;s how marriages happen every cent
certainly GF we all do it anyway so it&#39;s
my real it&#39;s my it&#39;s my one hope that
every one every single one of you 15 or
50 ask yourselves what am I really good
at what is it one thing that I love
doing and it&#39;s my one wish that the
answer comes to you just as easily as
the courage to go do that one thing
so go start that blog write that poetry
build that app create that website go
tell that person you love them be an
entrepreneurial lover because in the end
we only regret the chances we didn&#39;t
take with that I&#39;d like to share a tiny
bit of our journey at young preneur zwi
just launched this year and young
pruners just conducted the very first
official teen entrepreneurship camp in
india and it was the most beautiful
experience of my life and spending five
short days during the workshop with
these 14 year olds was all I needed to
experience and witness to know that
young people everywhere are born
entrepreneurial we put them in boxes and
20 years later reward them for
out-of-the-box thinking at the workplace
and as with any new initiative some
people told us you know 15 year olds I
don&#39;t know parents might think 15 year
olds are too young to be learning about
entrepreneurship
what is this mindset you speak off and I
smile silently to all of those parents
if you all agree that 15 year olds are
too young to be taking their own lives
because of a fear of failure in
hopelessness with the thought that they
fail to realize your dreams I say to you
all 15 year olds are certainly not too
young to start taking charge of their
lives and it&#39;s about time we get out of
their way and help them create a life of
meaning a life of purpose based on their
dreams not yours thank you very much for
you
