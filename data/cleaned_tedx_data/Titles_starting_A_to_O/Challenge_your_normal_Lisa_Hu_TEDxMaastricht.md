hello everyone before I tell you about
my few I&#39;d actually like to lick here
yours so please raise your hand if you
agree with the following who would like
a world in which we care for each other
and who would like a world with more
equality and who would like everyone in
this world to get a chance to develop
themselves well you know what we have a
chance to make that happen right here
because there were actually hundreds of
people on the wait list and 50 of them
have never joined such an event before
so we want to give them a chance to have
one of the good spots at this event and
are actually standing outside in the
lobby right now so we put some cards
under your seats and if you find one we
ask you to stand up and please give up
your spots so please check your seats
no one okay so that wasn&#39;t true
so there are no cards so that wasn&#39;t
true but the relief I spotted over here
was very true though and and how can we
blame you because who doesn&#39;t want a
better world and keep their entitlements
keep their good chair at the same time
but think about it do our entitlements
sometimes stand in the way of seeing the
other perspective and therefore maybe
stand in the way of change well knowing
we always see the world from our own
perspectives from our seated position so
to say it almost seems impossible to
know what is truly fair right well my
mother she found a way she didn&#39;t
exactly create world peace but she did
create peace at home because as a child
I had quite a strong focus for fairness
but mostly fairness for me
so in competition with my two year older
brother whenever there was something to
split I was always checking if I wasn&#39;t
getting the lesser option so when I was
something to share let&#39;s say a cake my
mom would say one of you gets to cut the
cake and the other one gets to pick
simple as that because if you don&#39;t know
what piece you&#39;ll end up having you
better make sure you split it fairly and
imagine the world working like this if I
don&#39;t know whether I will end up in the
Western world or end up having a head
start or not I&#39;m going to make sure
there&#39;s great health care and great
education for everyone right I better
make sure there&#39;s cake for everyone and
as long as questioning ourselves like
this it&#39;s not a common practice we
should stimulate dialogue and creativity
on how to make fair the new normal
because just like normal it&#39;s not a
fixed thing nor is fairness so as the
world keeps on changing
let&#39;s explore what we want this thing to
be now Roenick lee in the real world
aren&#39;t the people who get to cut first
usually also the ones who get to pick
first people with power how can we deal
with this how can we make sure that
anyone can take part in exploring how we
want society to work for exactly this I
designed a discussion tool together with
hundreds of children and t-shirts and
it&#39;s called Terra Nova mini mass obey
the mini society works like this along
the storyline of an island players
discuss solutions for societal issues
and the game asks you to let go of the
world as we know it just imagine if
anything were to be possible how would
you want it to work but you sit around
this game with other people and we&#39;re
all trying to apply our own ideals on
this little piece of land so I&#39;m curious
what happens then let&#39;s see what happens
then let&#39;s imagine that with the
thousands people in this room so look
around you with all these people here
we&#39;re going to start a new society so
are we going to group ourselves look
around are your neighbors are those the
people that you&#39;re going to live with or
are we free to mingle and moreover who
is deciding this for us which one of us
will become the new leaders of the group
and then daily life starts can I ask you
for your what&#39;s your name Oh Hank over
here has got two large fish really large
so it&#39;s Hank going to split his fish
with all of you or can you keep them and
then everyone wearing something blue
right now becomes ill for a long time
who&#39;s going to take care of them and
then for how long are you going to
support these people
so these are the exact questions that
players of Terranova whether it&#39;s teams
of nine-year-olds at school or adults of
local government the exact question that
they get to deal with on their islands
let&#39;s get an impression of what that
looks like
except on a look for day don&#39;t doubt the
record of salmon know it kept about this
is you&#39;ve got it&#39;ll become a pair of
somehow two fifties and the andhra
health rejoice your videos well here you
see kids at school and it&#39;s true in two
weeks a thousand of these games will be
spread among schools in the netherlands
but I&#39;m sure that the adults in this
room like challenge just as well so
let&#39;s play one of these ident questions
shall we I&#39;m going to read it out and
then I want to see hands for option A or
option B okay here we go
so you&#39;re Orange Islanders want to trade
their coconuts
for these blue people&#39;s fish an equal
trade is one to one but we know that the
blue people&#39;s fish will rot at some
points and therefore if we wait two
weeks who actually gets twice as much
and then the blue people did that work
equally hard for their fish but they
just get less back so these are the
options I&#39;d like to see Han so who&#39;s for
option a an equal trade right now one to
one and who&#39;s for option B way two weeks
but receive more I see so there&#39;s mostly
a minded people in this room and maybe
you might also wonder what does it even
matter what we want
in the end isn&#39;t it&#39;s the big companies
or governments who decide these things
and that&#39;s where I&#39;d like to like you
and and children and anyone who plays
terranova to experience that we decide
every day here you go a can of fish and
the second one is free recognize that so
we decide with our choices and someone
pays the price whether it&#39;s fishermen or
the environment so we decide what is
normal in society and therefore there
are also no right and wrong answers in
Terranova but you are challenged to
think about what is normal because we
give them to keep on viewing something
as normal we seem to just accept it
right
we no longer wonder about it or question
it and if we do not question we do not
change now you might have noticed in
practice when it comes to controversial
topics if you&#39;re talking to someone with
a different opinion and you don&#39;t agree
the conversation stops we declare that
the other one doesn&#39;t understand the
world like we do and that&#39;s that and
then if we talk to someone who we do
agree with well actually the more we
agree the more we want to talk to them
and maybe secretly enjoy that feeling of
being right but I was wondering what a
game situation would add to this
equation what if we could talk about
societal topics in a game play let&#39;s see
how kids handle the next situations
newcomers arriving on their islands
yeah those are kids but then the
ultimate test what happens if we get
voters for a right-wing populist party a
Labour Party and social liberalists to
figure the same question out together
can they form a society on a new piece
of land let&#39;s check it out yeah so
anything fell out and Terra Nova and so
there&#39;s a lot of diversity in these
things but there&#39;s actually one thing
that often happens in these mini
societies and that&#39;s like one of the
boys in the kids video what he says is
the orange people were here first
so they get to decide the rules and then
they do say that the blue and orange
people are equals
but then if later on in the game if the
blue people want to host a noisy ritual
or if they make a mistake it&#39;s the
orange people on their Island who
decides who has to leave or what the
rules are even so are they then truly
equals and if they&#39;re not in the
beginning can blue and orange ever
become equals then I&#39;ve literally asked
them like can the blue people ever
become orange so these are the exact
questions that I wanted to design
something for
societal challenges and I want to do to
do so together with the champions of
imagination and also the champions of
questioning why together with children
and I want to stress not so much for
children but rather with children
because they are the ones who showed me
that this should be a game because of
the game all players are equal
you don&#39;t need prior knowledge so anyone
can join and if you materialize these
abstract issues you can actually show
your ideas and another thing kids also
never asked me the question of how can I
win this game only adults do in that
question in that voice so then I like to
ask them back how can you win at society
and are you winning yet are we there yes
so it&#39;s the exploring that matters and
then the last thing about kids I admire
their openness and sometimes she&#39;s
saying huh that&#39;s really weird that I
thought this how often do we still do
this so what&#39;s the solution then for a
better society a little more empathy
well beware because the research says
that we empathize more with people from
our own social group people who are like
us
so our empathy is actually prejudice and
that means it&#39;s not enough to sit on our
chairs and then imagine from there what
other people might want we actually have
to work to see the other perspective
well here&#39;s the last example of how that
could work three years ago I was at a
school with kids for mostly higher
educated parents and clearly they were
all very aware of the social accepted
norms so when newcomers came to their
islands they said sure we will take care
of them here you go here&#39;s your camp and
a fish in a tree all set
so they thought until one girl said what
could be the downsides and she said if
you put them over here separately with
their own things they will never get to
know each other
and if you don&#39;t know each other you
could war later on because you can
understand each other well go 11
year-olds but there&#39;s a serious notion
behind this so if we do not organize
something we don&#39;t get to know each
other because you know what is normal
it&#39;s not universal and what is normal is
also not for a forever so let&#39;s
challenge our own and each other&#39;s
normals and we can start right now
think of something you found normal and
then go find one person who things
differently talk to them hear their
perspective maybe you change your ideas
maybe you don&#39;t but you leave knowing
there&#39;s other normals out there and
that&#39;s relevant anywhere citizens of the
world but also in the smaller societies
we know at our neighborhoods at work and
at home so next time let&#39;s invite
someone else to cut a cake thank you
