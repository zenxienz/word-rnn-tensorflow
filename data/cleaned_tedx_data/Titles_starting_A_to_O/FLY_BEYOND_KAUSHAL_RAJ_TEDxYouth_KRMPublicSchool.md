I feel like I&#39;m on top of the universe
as a privileged opportunity do you
forget next stop at my nightly flight
beyond
you don&#39;t know what would happen if I
drop this bit before you yes
but instead of this instead of this
falling down you float up yes
float up in space there&#39;s no gravity in
space the bend we float up have any of
you ever experienced zero gravity I had
the chance of experiencing it in Russia
last summer yes I was all geared up and
I was waiting with my instructor in
front of a huge glass chamber then he
told me to go into it then suddenly a
huge rush of Magnus push me to the top
in seconds
I was parallel to the surface of the
earth I was floating this is my
experience on zero-gravity
I regarded since it made not father we
had gone to come back on to see the
Naugatuck articles authors in each
temple he told me the name of the quad
the temple depicted and then told me
that each temple represented a celestial
body in the solar system
I wonder how ancient Indians you know
who the planets given went telescopes
were not invented then surah anaam
temple with this work which is dedicated
to the Sun burn the sunrays falls on the
deity with or another&#39;s of the media or
the word Equinox
this marks the birth of summer or how
the season in India this also happens in
kanakam Phil in Orissa and go there a
temple in Gujarat at the same end when I
was 11 years old I I gave a talk on
zero-gravity in my school I learned that
an ancient man vacationers are Alberta
and Bhaskar acharya and they have
discovered zero gravity over 1500 years
ago
Bhaskar Achaia has even given a sloka on
zero gravity off crustacean mischievous
italian custom who saw a become so Sofia
appreciated that positive Amati some a
Samantha were but i think i am que it
means that all objects follow the earth
due to the force of attraction which
gives the Earth Moon Sun stars and
constellations in their orbit this is
the Guru percussion Shakti or the
gravitational force but it was nine
years old my dad had got an awesome when
he came back he told me about the
patients shuttle launches propellers
and give me a lot more information I was
really surprised learn that NASA was
directly inspired by our be Monica
Shastra written by receiver and watcher
over 7,000 years ago he&#39;s written a hood
machines to fly in the air pushpaka
vimana and which fly in space shuttle a
vimana and about mercury propulsion
designing of spacecrafts spacesuits
eating food in space and even becoming
invisible the savior dr. - champion of
Ray had come to a school he gave a talk
on the ancient Indian science then my
dad got me a sinister as to master
telescope through which I star guests
because of which my interest in space
travel
multiplied I also remember one of the
ancient Sanskrit scholars named SP
Targaryen who hadn&#39;t written an aircraft
in 1895 mailmark Shakti which flew up to
a height of 1500 feet he also
demonstrated it in front of a huge
audience in Java the beach of Mumbai I
thought that if people could do so much
why can&#39;t I do something in the field of
space my interest field theorizing my
interest my parents sent me to Russia to
learn about space first we visited the
Moscow Aviation Institute that the
professor&#39;s
told us about that teaching methods
rocket engineering and space
listenership they were also allowed to
interact with the university students
there I was able to see satellites which
I am gone to space and had come back
second we visited the Russian Space
Center Ross cosmos there are over 250
cosmonauts have been trained and have
been sent to space I was able to meet
cosmonaut cherish our cherry pop a
person who had stairs
for more than six months I was able to
have my doubts clarified the space have
an end and the Broncos exist
we were also allowed to see him in one
of his training sessions in the
simulations I found out that living in
space was very difficult
we wouldn&#39;t build that and we have to
eat vacuum rifle one of the easiest
exercises on earth is one of us they
exist in space yes it is sleeping if you
wanted to sleep you know you just go
jump on a bed of sleep but it is not the
same in space first you have to stop
your back to the wall or the ceiling of
the spaceship then you have to get into
it then you have to zip yourself up and
attach your head to the to the wall
however your neck to relax only then can
you sleep sometimes if you don&#39;t tuck
your arms inside in the morning might
see one floating in front of you a
little bit what is that it is you don&#39;t
know you would also allow nations one of
it was doggy a spaceship to the
International Space Station and another
one was to have repaired the past in
space the end of that shoes gloves to
handle those minut paths and I couldn&#39;t
imagine doing the same in zero-gravity
after this experience I decided that I
should do something field and that I
should become a space scientist I want
to make space more reachable
enough for the good for everyone if you
are thinking I will I go under a lot of
problems to sauce to do this as point
has two sides there are less two ways
for a problem to be solved when life
gives you lemons you make lemonade out
of it
Steve Jobs has said that when you
innovate you make mistakes it is best to
admit them then and get on with the
proof your other innovations
they will do it an ancient Tamil poet
say in one of the steel colors that the
earth is spherical tsardom epic nether
whatever other are who don&#39;t have a type
it means no occupation is better than
agriculture in the spinning blow he knew
that the earth used to spin and was
freaking over 2,000 years ago space
saints has helped improve our knowledge
about the earth atmosphere and outer
space it has helped in the development
of many fields like education
communication health and disaster
management for example I am giving a
TEDx speech here in Chennai but you are
able to build all over the globe
thanks to silence which are the space
and now my hero
my inspiration my spacebar dr. APJ Abdul
Kalam sir has played an important role
in the India spare science I had the
chance of meeting him when in 2014 when
he had come to a school he asked me what
I wanted to become and they told him
that I wanted to become a nano scientist
I ever taught your speeches and about
how he said how he says that nano
science
he&#39;s very much helpful in space science
and health he is also spoken about how
space research is useful in fields like
then you open energy from space moon
based solar power stations faster travel
to space reusable spacecrafts
the space search nowadays is growing
very fast the European Space Agency is
planning to send a satellite name Cheops
to explore extraterrestrial planets
which will determine whether it can suit
human life or not the NASA&#39;s new
Horizons satellite had reached Pluto and
its moon Charon in 2016 and is now
traveling to towards the cube event
which is out a new path
for the most part of the solar system
before Easter by 2019 Japan aerospace
exploration agency Hayabusa 2 will be
reaching an ingenuity asteroid into the
first half of 2018 after it is done it
will launch sensors which will go by
data the asteroid which is useful for
determining the origin of life the
Indian Space Research Organisation will
be sending Chandra - to the moon in 2018
to find about its ecology and evolution
but this is being done only by
governments and that space agencies I
want this to be the dream of every
individual officers we can all go to a
country nearest by flight in one heart
was and I want space 7 and
interplanetary talent to be at the same
time according to modern science we the
speed of light it still lacked kilometer
per second even if we can&#39;t reach that
speed if we just down 1/5 of the speed
of night we can reach mass within an arm
I will like to invent such a machine
which towers at that speed and it will
have the best technology so people don&#39;t
need to have spacesuits
I have artificial gravity so people
would have a hassle-free travel if we
can please mass within an hour Marshall
not already be a pure spot you can go
there for daily work and you can come
back like we are visiting the Navigon
our temples cocoon up in one day we
might be able to use it all a nice
solar system in one day who knows maybe
even giving a TEDx piece of math I&#39;m
thinking about space turbine we should
forget about our mother
Yuri Gagarin the first cosmonaut in
space said that I saw how beautiful the
earth is I saw the clouds and then dark
shadows on the distant earth no walk the
water was darkest slightly gleaming
spots a light blue RN surrounds the
earth which gradually darkens becoming
turf eyes dark blue violet and finally
cold black I enjoy the rich color
spectrum of the earth people let us
preserve and increase is beauty and not
destroyed let us fly beyond and conquer
the galaxies thank you
[Applause]
