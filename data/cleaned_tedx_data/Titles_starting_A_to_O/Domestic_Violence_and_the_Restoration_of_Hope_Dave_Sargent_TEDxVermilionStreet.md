one night
I went to pick up a woman who ran away
from her husband after he beat her she
had fled on foot leaving behind for
three babies when I came upon her
location I saw merely a speck of her at
a payphone at the shell of a big-box
store across a huge empty parking lot a
modern-day picture of the utter
desolation of the dark night of a soul I
thought what do I do now these dark
nights often come to a deadlier end
recently a man allegedly stabbed his
ex-partner to death by slitting her
throat and staying in the bedroom with
her body for 10 hours imagine the fear
and suffering this young woman endured
probably knowing she was about to die a
police officer once said to me if people
only saw the cruelty of a domestic
murder like we do we would still ask
what do we do about it
more than ten million victims are abused
by their intimate partners each year
more than half the women who are killed
or murdered by their partners three
dying every day so why do we tolerate
such savagery because we are not
sufficiently outraged to act effectively
because domestic violence doesn&#39;t
usually enter our consciousness until it
enters our lives and when it does it
devastates all involved because no one
knows what to do
a father is scared he fears his
daughters in danger from her abusive
husband his worst fear comes true
and he laments I knew he would kill her
I didn&#39;t know what to do domestic
violence is so deeply pervasive reaching
into every class of every community some
of us here have suffered domestic
violence because of a loved one struggle
some of us here are victims some
survivors one in four women one in seven
men will experience severe intimate
partner violence in their lives this is
the world to which victims awoke this
morning or died in it&#39;s also our world
what will we choose to do about it
I come to you as a former Washington DC
police officer who&#39;s worked in
neighboring Maryland in a second career
with domestic violence who is
experienced its ravages on a personal
level at every level the same question
what can I do today I&#39;ll offer an answer
a note to start I&#39;ll sometimes refer to
the victim as a woman to emphasize the
crux of the problem as an issue of
violence against women
some men are abused as well have you
ever seen a woman walking down the
street late at night with a stroller
kids straggling behind did you shake
your head at the sadness of that site or
even judge what&#39;s she doing out at this
are with those kids how did you respond
like many of us it&#39;s none of my business
or with the thought she might be abused
even harder yet they can choose to leave
this is what makes domestic abuse so
difficult to process the illusion that
victims have choices what are the
destructive forces that caused the
victims dilemma intimate partner
violence is perpetrated by a lone abuser
who&#39;s the current or ex-partner of their
target the one they&#39;re said to love
victims are under the abusers power and
control coerced and manipulated at every
step
abuse is very often physically violent
but always emotional 28%
of murdered victims had never
experienced physical violence in the
relationship it&#39;s learned behavior
through experiences growing up creating
both abusers and victims carried on from
one generation to the next
abusers aren&#39;t born violent it&#39;s a
pattern of abuse not an isolated
incident abusers are not one-hit wonders
they have a history of abuse for which
they are often not held accountable
giving them license to continue
unfettered many victims would choose to
leave but feel they can&#39;t because of
uncontrollable circumstances having the
ability to pack up and leave is
privileged many victims have nothing not
money for food for bus fare for hotel
for diapers victims are often paralyzed
by the fear their partners will become
more violent or kill them if they tried
to leave and their sense is correct
75% of murdered victims were leaving or
had left their partner fear devastation
listen to the shambles of a child&#39;s
voice now an orphan as she tells the
9-1-1 operator that her daddy just
killed her mommy and they&#39;re both dead
you will never be able to unhear that
and once violence starts it often
becomes more frequent more severe can
you imagine how a woman can sleep can
cope how the kids can look forward to
their day at school when they know their
mother is being
brutalized and their own beatings may
await them the specter of violence
always lurking victims always looking
over their shoulder can you imagine a
darker world but this is the world in
which many members of this community are
living or dying as each day passes what
can we do if we know someone in our
community is in danger and we have the
benefit of learning who they are and
doing something about it whose job is it
to try to save their life the struggle
toward the restoration of Hope involves
one more ingredient responsibility in
its fullest form the will and the
willingness of the community to step in
and the faithfulness and resolve to do
it will
a recent study cites that 10% of
domestic homicide victims had
experienced some form of violence in the
month preceding their death noting
potential missed opportunities for
intervention I&#39;m here to talk to you
about becoming proactive in intervention
and prevention specifically through a
practice used in 36 states called the
lethality assessment program the lab the
lab came about in 2003 because the
Maryland Network Against Domestic
Violence a nonprofit organization wanted
to address the problem of
intimate-partner homicides and to
provide first responders and advocates
the tools to do that using the best
research we wanted to create
a user-friendly instrument for field
practitioners that would identify high
danger victims those in the greatest
danger of being killed by their partner
and get them help a team of researchers
and practitioners with the commitment to
getting it right
worked for two years to create a new
model in the way practitioners such as
law enforcement and domestic violence
advocates would do business getting it
right also men we had to create a
proactive way to connect high danger
victims immediately to the protective
and empowering services of a domestic
violence program the stark reality is
that only four percent of victims who&#39;d
been killed had reached out to a hotline
or shelter in the year prior to their
death we had to change that dynamic the
best way in our judgment a phone call
from the scene we feel tested officers
told us the Lapp process was easy enough
to do we implemented in 2005 here&#39;s how
it works on the scene an officer uses
criteria to decide if a lethality screen
should be administered that an assault
occur have officers been to the home
before did something just not seem right
the screen is comprised of eleven
yes-or-no questions these are evidence
based mostly nonviolent behaviors and
factors that identify high danger
victims once a victim is assessed as
being in high danger the officer gives
them first
the bad news then the good news it
sounds like this miss Sonia according to
your answers you&#39;re in danger
people in your situation have been
killed what I&#39;d like to do now is call
the local domestic violence hotline to
get some information to give to you and
while I&#39;m on the phone I&#39;d like you to
think about speaking with them what do
you think no you don&#39;t want to it&#39;s okay
you know you don&#39;t have to but as I said
I&#39;m gonna call them to get some
information for you and while I&#39;m on the
phone
just think about maybe speaking with
them
the officer makes the call if the victim
agrees with the officer on the scene the
advocate and the victim have a brief
private conversation in which the
Advocate actively encourages the victim
to go into the program&#39;s services this
dialogue you just heard is about
encouraging trust promoting a
partnership among the officer advocate
and victim and offering the victim hope
and empowerment
even with successes we strive to make
the lap even better by putting it in the
hands of anyone who comes in contact
with a victim of domestic violence the
vision of the lab is three
interconnected circles of participation
the first circle is law enforcement the
primary first responders the second
circle or the healthcare system social
services private practices and
organizations the faith community these
are professionals in whom victims trust
and confide who connect them to domestic
violence services the third circle not
yet closed with the greatest power to
help prevent domestic homicide is the
public particularly those personally
involved in a victim&#39;s life
family friends harken back to that
father&#39;s lament if we don&#39;t close that
third circle the lap is not complete and
that father&#39;s lament will become our
Bane it takes all three circles of
community participation to have as full
and effect on prevention as we humanly
and systematically can so what can we
choose to do about it it&#39;s likely so few
high danger victims go into services
because they don&#39;t realize the trouble
they&#39;re in or that services even exist
I call upon you law enforcement health
care allied professionals the faith
community to close that third circle so
the community can join you in a
proactive community commitment to
faithfully and fully accept the
responsibility of getting victims into
services and saving lives and if you
will let&#39;s take the first step now faith
house of Acadiana is the local domestic
violence program please take out your
phones you can take out your phones and
save this number their local 24-hour
hotline for when you need some of you
may not be from this area so I encourage
you to look up your local domestic
violence program and save their number
agencies organizations if you don&#39;t know
faiths house already make a call
introduce yourselves make the connection
mother&#39;s father&#39;s family friends
concerned community members if a loved
one is being abused call faith house
don&#39;t wait become the first community to
realize the full vision of the lab as an
empowering force to restore hope and
choice to victims in your midst you can
choose to do that
