[Music]
[Applause]
breathe when you want
so you can breathe come back in mostly
for my benefit it sounds like the sea
try out the letter M
keep yelling breathe come in when you
want that&#39;s a rule breathe when you want
is actually one of the human rights so
that&#39;s a rule that I can&#39;t take it away
from you you breathe when you want the
alternative is worse keep going
[Music]
so now you&#39;re singing em switch it
gradually to an like super celestial
tower back to me switch to sing my one
keep going
maybe lo people yellow people you keep
it going
[Music]
someone over here
that can be ladder be breakable when I
say someone I&#39;m in this region gonna
have a debate over so ever remember you
know this is it breed and singing the
game so now it&#39;s stronger because you
have air that won&#39;t last so we&#39;ll do it
again
yeah even it can be stronger we could
make one way to make it stronger switch
it to our but go back to oh I want I
don&#39;t know why it&#39;s just my mood this is
you or no deep yeah now watch
interesting okay forget the cord
beautiful Rosa was ooh everyone&#39;s back
here that&#39;ll work
that&#39;s it
what do you think this is this is a
direction for example make sense you go
breathe somehow I hate to tell you this
but don&#39;t laugh ah
that was a breath when I do this it&#39;s a
breath we have to figure that together
and you know we&#39;ve got other time hands
up who has never sung in a choir before
hmm
who has there&#39;s another question who
doesn&#39;t think their voice is good enough
to sing in a choir ah more that makes
sense that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t join the
choir um that&#39;s actually really common
and it&#39;s funny but it&#39;s also super
tragic so in my work you might have
guessed that I&#39;m a choir conductor does
it say oh that&#39;s me kinda thing acquire
as was this in my line of work a lot of
people when they find out I&#39;m a choir
conductor they almost always unless they
sing in choirs tell me I&#39;ll never sing
in your choir and they back it up I
haven&#39;t a note in my head I&#39;m terrible
I&#39;m the worst I it&#39;s it&#39;s and that
started happening and I thought okay
fair enough some people don&#39;t like to
sing in choirs but it happens often and
it&#39;s quite intense they they really dig
the heel in I know it&#39;s not for me I
can&#39;t do it which got me thinking maybe
this isn&#39;t as simple as this person has
made a choice that they&#39;ve tried it and
singing isn&#39;t for them um
the interesting thing is that their
voice so everyone&#39;s voice is unique it
has to be because everyone&#39;s physiology
is unique on top of that generally
people&#39;s ears are good enough that you
can identify if you know someone you
know their voice you don&#39;t have to see
them you answer the phone before they&#39;ve
said hello its me it&#39;s Sam you if you&#39;ve
met me if you&#39;ve heard my voice ago I
know that place um we&#39;re very good
associating ourselves and other people
with their voice our voice is
representative of everything we do and
you see in politics that oh you&#39;ve got a
vote equals your voice and all this
rhetoric stuff well that sort of sleeps
in that when you how you use your voice
is ultimately how people perceive you a
lot of the time scaring a reason why
people end up being a bit scared of
singing a more direct reason is this
common story that these people tell me
when I have these chats about them not
joining my choir
they usually when they get to it they&#39;re
not saying they never want to they&#39;re
saying they did singing was at one point
a great thing to do and what ended up
happening it&#39;s inevitably the same story
I know Ted usually you pick oh this
little Jerry and little Jerry was
singing in the choir and he was politely
asked not to
there is no Jerry but I figure it&#39;s
easier um
this is common enough I don&#39;t know
that&#39;s another question maybe for the
hands who&#39;s been asked to mine when they
were a kid I see it&#39;s they the thing of
it is it saves the Christmas play maybe
but what it ends up doing is you send a
message to a young person that your
voice which you already know at this age
represents all of you is not welcome
here and your contribution to the group
makes the group worse it&#39;s intense
so that&#39;s the summary of it that people
are scared to sing doing and for that
reason I i somehow escaped that I&#39;ll
sing all day long on the bus and on the
Darton under my car what car is safe
enough um I wanted that experience to be
everyone&#39;s experience so I said up a Koi
de la la la choir its main goal was open
to anyone and whatever disasters that
brings my way as a choral conduct
I just have to deal with it and
interesting enough it didn&#39;t bring any
disasters actually um people flocked
actually it was a word-of-mouth thing
and they all said okay let&#39;s check this
out and a lot of people who have been
told this same story that you cannot
sing you should mind you should do
tennis or something they came and we did
rehearsals we did this we did you and
all the rest of it and it it started
sinking in that actually maybe I can&#39;t
they actually some of them have said
that you know this is life-changing or
this is next part of the week and one
guy that it hit me and this is a real
guy not like little Jerry who I invented
but I won&#39;t tell you think he said it
changed how he ordered a cup of coffee
in his words the rehearsal that we would
have resonated in him throughout the
week nice musical phrase and he found
that let&#39;s say we rehearsed on a
Thursday the following Tuesday he just
was able to use his speaking voice he
was more present in everything that he
did so with that in mind I camera going
with it but I&#39;m just looking at the
clock I&#39;m gonna make a choir out of you
mm I go say that
[Music]
mango mango mango mango mango mango
mango mango mango mango mango - that&#39;s
always an interesting test clap twice it
never works unless you have the grew the
mango ice grooves going on so mango
mango mango juice isn&#39;t mango mango
mango mango mango mango mango mango
mango mango Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi
Kiwi there are ten Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi
Kiwi
yes but birdied first because otherwise
you sound like a most Kiwi that I
accidentally walked in on my way here
ready I&#39;m gonna do it then you&#39;re gonna
do Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi
Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi mommy do it again yeah do
you make me the first one Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi
Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi yes there&#39;s a third one
banana banana mmm
here I got two three
[Music]
yeah okay now the second time you&#39;ve
seen banana silly but don&#39;t don&#39;t
sacrifice the music for it listen bah
bah it&#39;s the highest note in the song
but it&#39;s not that high you can totally
do it listen to how I see bahnana
bahnana bahnana forget them for a second
we&#39;ll get that in there
here we go dude yeah but that was
similarly sad like the key it helps if
you tap your legs I don&#39;t want to hear
it it&#39;s just for you one two three and
[Music]
[Music]
go get
[Music]
yes so this is actually important
believe it or not
mmm have to lead into the banana the act
of going mmm uses up all your air if
you&#39;re doing it well but you can&#39;t do
that your singers now you&#39;re
professionals your audience you have to
be aware when you go bananas kiwi Kiwi
Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi just these
guys the ones who sang that wonderful
quarter all three of you know I think
the way I&#39;m gonna do it is just judging
from the yeah you&#39;re first hmm a second
one mmm mango mango the less of you need
to be three times as brave and then you
go Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi Kiwi
listen to each other we have a couple
time left chop-chop wait beautiful but
you will benefit a lot from although
with that cell you&#39;ve got the self
satisfaction that comes from seeing
mango you think your part is the only
one but it&#39;s not they have to sing as
well and that&#39;s what happens and I can
attest that myself and the balloon
audience loved it but it didn&#39;t have the
same time this is where the tapping your
leg thing comes in not too passionate
but chuckling here we go this time
nothing to stop so there they&#39;re coming
in regardless you got mangoes Kiwis
