good afternoon fellow I&#39;m here to tell
you a story and the story starts with a
mattress a few months ago I wanted a new
mattress so I went to a store and I
asked the salesperson I really need a
good mattress and she said well this is
the best mattress you will ever have and
I asked her why and she said it&#39;s very
good for your back and when you sleep on
this mattress the next morning you are
so fresh you full of energy so it&#39;s the
best thing you can ever buy and then I
asked her is this really a good mattress
and she said yes is a good mattress it&#39;s
good for your back you will sleep very
well and then I said well maybe I&#39;m not
quite clear but can you tell me where
this mattress is made from her eyes
became a little bit bigger and then I
asked her how is it produced where does
it come from and maybe completely funny
in five years can I return this mattress
as a resource and get a new one back and
your eyes became bigger and bigger and
bigger so she called her chief and he
came and he said this is the best
mattress you can ever buy and I said no
I want a really good mattress and what I
find out that we had different points of
perspectives regarding quality but let
me tell you this story why did I ask
these questions well we all facing huge
problems and I&#39;m not here today to talk
about these huge problems we all know
them when I drove to van Lowe this
morning I heard on the radio there&#39;s a
big conference now going on and born and
Germany about climate change in 2017
will be again record warm but we are
facing co2 increase me increasing we are
facing energy crisis we have a lot of
wastes and we have to do something about
it and we all know that
and we feel actually guilty about that
and what we are doing is that we try to
minimize these things instead of really
handling them so I was thinking maybe we
should turn it around maybe we can
create goodness and solve these problems
by consuming wouldn&#39;t that be nice
that we can actually be beneficial as
humans in this world and buying things
and developing things and that we don&#39;t
have to feel guilty about that that
wouldn&#39;t that be great I&#39;m convinced
that would create a complete different
kind of energy how did it all start it
it has to do with a mindset it has to do
with consciousness regarding - what&#39;s
quality worth and I had the honor to be
the project manager of this beautiful
new City Hall and van Lowe started eight
years ago a building that is cleaning
the air it&#39;s closing water loops it&#39;s
cleaning water it&#39;s a resource bank the
materials that are in this building can
be reused again without a quality lost
it makes Venlo a little bit better
because it&#39;s cleaning the air outside
but most of all it&#39;s a healthy building
by using the right materials and usually
using fresh air the people who are
working in this building actually
healthier and more productive and being
good for this city so that was the main
goal of this building that was all about
quality but how did we get to that that
was the mindset of cradle to cradle
cradle to cradle is a principle that&#39;s
the city embedded eight years ago and
that is all about creating a positive
footprint that we as humans can be
beneficial to the third to this earth by
consuming and pray Cradle to Cradle has
three principles
the first one is waste this food every
material that we are using aren&#39;t
producing can be reused again without a
quality lost
and as healthy and when we produce these
materials we use the right energy so
like solar income or water energy or
wind energy we have enough of this
energy I&#39;m always amazed that we are
talking about an energy problem when you
realize that every day the Sun spends
energy as that we have used the last 200
years every day so we have enough we
just have to use it and the third one is
enjoy diversity this means that we would
like to create a diverse world not only
in a society but also in an economical
way and this mindset helped me in my
work here in Venlo to make a building
that is really making fellow better but
let me translate these principles to
what I really would like to tell you we
talked about these problems about
climate change about waste problems
water problems air problems and we try
to fix them but how are we doing this
the last 30 years we try to reduce
negative things so we try to minimize
waste we try to make the air a little
bit less dirty but we are not going to
solve the main problems by reducing
things and I am convinced that we don&#39;t
want to reduce we want to consume I
think that&#39;s one of the main problems
that it isn&#39;t working in the right way
and actually the reducing mindset can
lead to other problems for example air
quality we are so focused on reducing
bad energy like gases or coals or oil
that we isolated our buildings in a way
that we are creating sick buildings and
that&#39;s actually a funny thing so we try
to do something good we are minimizing
things and actually creating a new
problem isn&#39;t that funny that has all to
do with a mindset it has to do with
awareness
when you brought your children to school
to the ground school did you ever ask
the question what is the air quality in
this building or when you buy your house
what&#39;s the air quality in this building
or when you go to work and isn&#39;t it
actually a funny thing when you realize
that per thousand parts per million co2
you can have your concentration level
goes down with 25 percent in the
Netherlands we have schools with three
thousand parts cu2 per million
then it isn&#39;t funny that children cannot
concentrate so the mindset of reducing
doesn&#39;t solve problems maybe in the end
we make it perfectly wrong but we are
not creating a positive footprint so I
was thinking wouldn&#39;t it be nice to do
something good for yourself
and for the world by consuming and do
something 100 percent good I&#39;m convinced
that this will create lots of different
kind of energy that it&#39;s alright to be
on this earth that&#39;s a fest that we can
celebrate that we are here but we have
to do it in a way we have to consume it
in a way that we&#39;re actually really
creating this positive footprint and how
can you do that by asking questions that
was why when I was buying I wanted to
buy this mattress I asked these
questions because for me these questions
are now so obvious thanks to my work and
the new City Hall that I am
understanding on what quality is really
worth so please start asking these
questions and wouldn&#39;t it be nice that
you do something good for yourself and
for the world and of course people are
always saying well at this way more
expensive well first of all asking
questions doesn&#39;t cost money so
everybody can do that and second of all
when you are aware of what you are
buying you will actually see that you&#39;re
often buying things that are bad or
maybe a little bit less bad so maybe we
should stop doing that and saving
actually money but most of all if we are
aware that we can
solve these big problems and they cost a
lot of money by consuming then we can
really do something else then we can add
quality and quality is also a value and
maybe make it quite simple when I ask
you do you want to live above the red
line or beneath the red line of course
this is an open door everybody wants to
live in a world that&#39;s healthy with
clean air with clean water without waste
and with biodiversity so if you don&#39;t
want to talk about cradle to cradle
that&#39;s ok that&#39;s fine for me but realize
that we can actually establish your
world above the red line by consuming
awareness is the key to make this change
two weeks ago I did buy a mattress
because the producer of another store
could tell me where the mattress was
made from and how it was produced but
one week later this person from the
first shop he called me and he said well
did you buy a mattress I said yes I did
oh I said ok I just want you to know
that last week someone else asked me
exactly the same questions and I&#39;ve made
him thought he said I am going to
contact the producers of the mattresses
that I am selling because I want to sell
good stuff because I didn&#39;t see that
something is going on in this world and
the mindset is changing and we can
increase this change by asking the right
question so please when you buy
something when you bring your children
to school ask yourself the question am i
adding value or doing am i doing
something bad a little bit less bad
because I am convinced and the proof is
for example a new cereal that we can
create goodness and solve problems by
consuming thank you
so FinCEN thank you could you perhaps
maybe summarize a little bit on how do
we actually add value to our life and
environment first of all why not well
when you are buying things for me as a
person I&#39;m for me it&#39;s very important
that they are healthy so that I know
that I want to buy that other I spend
money on something and I just want to
know what I&#39;m buying
yes okay thank you Michelle we&#39;ve had
some fascinating discussions I don&#39;t
know if the audience actually knows this
but Michelle&#39;s not only worked on
sustainability and the environment here
but also in a country that I hold very
dear which is Namibia so I&#39;d like to ask
you one quick question about Namibia and
then after that invite you to join me
for a drink downstairs so we can talk a
little bit more yeah what do you see as
the main challenges both for the first
world in terms of sustainability in the
environment and the third world where do
you see the crossover I think that that
awareness is one of the biggest
challenges and what I see is that when
we do projects that a lot of people are
saying why didn&#39;t we do that before and
that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t ask the right
questions thank you very much for I&#39;m
still very interested in hearing more
about Namibia so let&#39;s go have a drink
we&#39;re and carry on with the program oh
thank you very much ladies and gentlemen
you
[Applause]
