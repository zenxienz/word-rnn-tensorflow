oh my gosh you&#39;re beautiful I&#39;m
beautiful together we are beautiful and
our scars are beautiful I want you to
place your hand over your heart you feel
that that&#39;s our purpose I want you to
take a deep breath in inhaling through
your nose and exhaling through your
mouth repeat after me I love you I am
enough thank you it has taken me decades
to understand that concept as a
recovering perfectionist I struggled and
hid my wounds because of shame
embarrassment and never feeling good
enough I suffered in silence tonight I
stand here in front of you sharing my
authentic genuine true self to break the
stigma of mental health and addiction
I&#39;ve done intensive work both personally
and professionally and my mission is to
help others so that they know that they
too may heal we&#39;ve got to stop comparing
ourselves to others and minimizing our
symptoms today I know we&#39;re not alone
and I know it&#39;s not our fault untreated
mental health is a global epidemic and
people are dying because of it as a
psychotherapist over the last 13 years I
have had the honor of working with
thousands of people to help them treat
symptoms of anxiety depression bipolar
disorder addiction and
drama we do heal but we can&#39;t do it
alone
we heal together and I am living proof
one in five people struggle with mental
health we have to take action if we have
a medical condition such as diabetes we
see a doctor
we take medication we follow a food and
exercise plan self-care is a
non-negotiable we cannot treat mental
health any differently we have to stop
hiding and living in shame
this summer I was privy to seven
suicides of people ranging in ages from
15 to 40 we&#39;ve got to tell on ourselves
to get the help we deserve to live the
life we desire we&#39;re all recovering from
something and we&#39;re all survivors I once
heard a 12-step meeting we are as sick
as our secrets and that could not have
rang more true to me once I started
sharing my story with others I heard me
too and a connection was made
shame evaporated and empathy was
all-consuming radical honesty in our
relationships lead to greater intimacy
and as a result we never have to feel
alone at a young age I heard a parent
describing me to another parent as a
precocious child she&#39;s big for her
britches and attention-seeking well
there&#39;s some truth to those adjectives
however what they didn&#39;t know was that I
was an old soul I felt deeply and at a
young age I had a strong spiritual
connection women for girls is sexually
abused and that statistic comes from
only the number of those that are
reported at the age
and there was an innocence that was
taken away from me when a family friend
had sexually abused me on numerous
occasions I was so scared but I didn&#39;t
tell anybody because I thought it was my
fault
until one day in school we were learning
about appropriate verse inappropriate
touch and we were encouraged to tell a
safe adult if we had ever experienced
anything bad happened to us so I came
home from school that day I put on my
brave cape I dug deep into my core for
the courage and I told my dad and I
wanted him to be my superhero and saved
me but he didn&#39;t believe me it was my
first lesson in learning to bottle up my
feelings shove them deep down side and
never to talk about those types of
things
I had regretted I had ever said anything
40 to 60% of elementary school girls
ages 6 through 12
are worried about gaining weight or
becoming fat one in five women will
develop a significantly clinical eating
disorder at some point in their life a
driving factor for developing an eating
disorder is a need to self-soothe self
punishment and shame as many young
survivors experienced I started becoming
body conscious I remember being in a
dance class standing in front of the
mirror and comparing myself to my peers
I looked down at my stomach and I
thought oh you&#39;re so fat it was a
gradual progression but I started over
exercising I loved the high I got from
cardio I loved the way my body felt in
the shape of my muscles started changing
my dad started noticing and complimented
me on how good I looked I loved his
attention I felt powerful in control and
I strived for perfection by the age of
13 I had taken things to extreme
measures when I could no longer starve
myself I&#39;d hoard food in my room and eat
until I was so uncomfortably
fall and then I would use laxatives and
vomiting until I was clean my best
friend noticed my strange behaviors and
she wanted me to get help so she told on
me
little did I know she would continue to
be an angel in my life for the next 20
years
but I really hated her for it at the
time I got honest with my mom and the
next day she had appointments for me to
see a psychiatrist and a nutritionist
and I started individual therapy it
saved my life but I still felt defective
and I didn&#39;t tell anybody so it was just
our secret she would drive me downtown
every week and I started liking who I
was becoming we worked on having a
healthier relationship with food
self-love and I started processing the
sexual abuse for the first time in my
life I felt like I had an advocate and
at the age of 16 I knew that I too
wanted to become a therapist to help
others heal my writing and self-help
books really helped me I would spend
hours in bookstores reading memoirs
written by women who had overcome
similar things that I was struggling
with I craved a healthy lifestyle and I
had a clear vision in my mind that I
wanted to become a social worker college
would be a chance to start over in my
final year of undergrad I was working as
a cocktail waitress at a bar to pay for
school I was walking down a street on my
way home and the man met me in a dimly
lit alley he approached me and knocked
me hard onto the concrete and started
sexually assaulting me I screamed as
loud as I could but it felt like only
whispers I fought for my life I was able
to break free and I ran to the nearest
public place and now
them to call the police two male
officers arrived and they asked if I had
been drinking I was stone-cold sober yet
again I felt shame embarrassment and as
if I was the one who had done something
wrong I struggled with post-traumatic
stress disorder for the next year I felt
dirty and violated I couldn&#39;t stand
being in my own skin therapy had helped
me in the past so I knew where to go I
joined a group for survivors who were
who had been sexually abused and I
started individual therapy again having
daily corrective experiences of feeling
safe in my environment my treatment and
the most supportive relationship with my
boyfriend who is now my husband were the
major contributors to my healing by 25 I
had more clinical training from personal
experiences than I could have ever
learned in any doctoral program but I
went back and got my masters in Social
Work with a concentration in mental
health I graduated married my boyfriend
and we moved to Southern California to
follow our dreams I could hardly wait to
start building a life together a clean
slate new beginnings I was on my way a
year later we decided to start a family
parenting is the hardest job I have ever
had can I get an amen thank you but it
is also the most rewarding it can be so
extreme and dichotomous in nature I can
go from one minute screaming at my
five-year-old daughter for scaling the
refrigerator and pulling out a gallon of
chocolate spilling it all over the floor
to then the next minute picking her up
as we&#39;re singing and laughing on our way
to the bath we become parents overnight
we go to the hospital we have a baby we
bring them home and a couple of days
later we&#39;re supposed to know how to care
for these little Souls we can read
thousands of books I know I did and
didn&#39;t help there&#39;s nothing that
compares to the experiential learning
process I call it trial by fire we can
be hard on ourselves for the type of
parent we want to be we need to
recognize what our limitations are and
try to do our best we can have all of
these plates spinning in the air
expecting them to be shiny and perfect
but it&#39;s just not possible
we&#39;re sleep-deprived having body image
issues of gaining 40 pounds during
pregnancy trying to connect with our
partner while having low libido as a
result of Nursing it felt so
overwhelming one in seven women struggle
with postpartum depression and I was one
of them I thought having a baby was
supposed to be a happy time again I felt
that self judgment and shame I went back
to therapy and I started medication and
the FOB began to lift it was amazing I
learned how to lean on other people and
I learned to be more gentle with myself
I truly believe it takes a village to
raise my tribe one in seven people
struggle with substance abuse
the addiction being runs strong in my
family of origin and I grew up above my
parent&#39;s bar a heavy drinking culture to
say the least I had my first drink when
I was 12 and I blacked out my biggest
fear in life was becoming an alcoholic
so much so that I did my graduate
internship at a drug and alcohol rehab
facility I thought I can outsmart this
disease for 20 years I tried to manage
and control my drinking I&#39;ll just drink
beer during the week okay red wine on
the weekends but just a bottle and I&#39;ll
alternate every other drink with water
I&#39;ll just sip tequila okay I definitely

won&#39;t drink before 5:00 okay twist my
arm for do not alcoholic seriously have
this much
dialogue it was exhausting and I was the
definition of insanity I kept doing the
same thing over and over again and
expecting different results
I&#39;m high-functioning I ran marathons I
got married and had children I wasn&#39;t
what an alcoholic looked like at least
in my eyes I was successful in my career
I certainly wasn&#39;t as bad as those
people in that drug and alcohol rehab
facility we have got to stop labeling am
I an alcoholic
am I not is it a disease I took that
damn 12 question are you an alcoholic
test dozens of times and I didn&#39;t quite
fit the bill so it gave me permission to
keep drinking I had this moment in my
kitchen and I was over looking into the
living room at my four small children as
I was pouring a glass of wine after work
and then another and I thought how the
hell am I going to be able to take these
kids to all their activities and still
have happy hour which didn&#39;t seem so
happy anymore I was sick and tired of
being sick and tired on March 10th 2013
at the age of 35 I decided to give up
drinking for good what sealed the deal
was when my best friend that same girl
who told on me for having an eating
disorder had decided to get sober
herself
I saw her exude serenity acceptance and
self-love I wanted what she had I didn&#39;t
need to hit rock bottom to give up
drinking I had hit so many rock bottoms
in my drinking career she offered to
take me to a women&#39;s meeting and she
suggested that I pour out all the
alcohol in my house I was scared as hell
but I listened I craved self-respect I
attached to a community of people who
taught me how to be sober and I felt
found role models
today my kids know that I don&#39;t drink
they know that mom is not the best
version of herself with alcohol and
every year on my sober anniversary they
celebrate with me we live in a normally
saturated drinking culture when I told
people I had stopped drinking they said
Kelly if you&#39;re an alcoholic then I&#39;m an
alcoholic
you&#39;re really hard on yourself can&#39;t you
just drink less well I wish I could
aren&#39;t those meetings for old homeless
men who smoke too many cigarettes and
drink coffee and church basements well
sure there are some of those but
addiction does not discriminate it can
affect any age race socio-economic and
education level we have got to change
our perception of what we think an
alcoholic looks like or we will stay
sick and people will die
my writing helped me heal I&#39;ve kept a
journal since I was 12 and I knew that I
always wanted to write a book on April
12th 2017 I published an autobiography
of rival called myself I wanted others
to know that they too could heal and
that they never had to feel alone who my
strength is my husband and my children
they&#39;re the most precious gift to me I
needed to break the cycle of addiction
for me but for them as well because the
likelihood that one of the four of them
will struggle with mental health or
addiction is high and I wanted to and
need to be a living example of positive
recovery for them I beg you to heal your
wounds so that they can become beautiful
scars
we are so resilient and we can keep
climbing that mountain no matter how
many damn times we get knocked down we
need to remain open and spiritually
awake we need to build communities of
people who inspire us we need to seek
professional help I wish it were a
mandatory requirement that everybody
engaged in one year of therapy we all be
more compassionate and less judgmental
through all this adversity I thought I
can&#39;t go on I can&#39;t do this anymore but
there was always hope deep down inside
and when we tap into that hope show up
and do the hard work we can live a life
beyond our wildest imagination
and I promise you it will be worth the
ride namaste
[Applause]
