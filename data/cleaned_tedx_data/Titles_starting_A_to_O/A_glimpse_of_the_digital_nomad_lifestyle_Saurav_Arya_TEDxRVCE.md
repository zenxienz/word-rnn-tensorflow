as a little kid I always imagined that
one day I would run up this is a picture
of beautified elder brother and as you
can see I&#39;m all geared up to run towards
the distant horizon that caught my
attention I never got a real chance to
run away as a kid you know how
protective parents are but when I grew
up I pursued my engineering and then I
started working as a sufficient
professional it was a regular
nine-to-five jobs and very soon I
started getting bored of the monotony of
Magpies and then one day I stumbled upon
this coat the real betrayal is
forgetting yourself and this reminded me
of my childhood dream that is to break
free and explode the world so I feel
that probably this is the right time to
break free from the 9 to 5 and do what I
really wanted that is to store the world
so I break up with 9 to 5 and I decided
to travel for a year in search of
fulfillment creative freedom and
spiritual growth I call that here a year
full of Sundays because the idea was
live every day of that year like a leave
my country no work no boss no
subordinate just go with the flow and
explore so I started that here with
first circumnavigating India then I went
to Southeast Asia East Africa and China
and I need all of this travel on
extremely shoestring budget on a
youthful day I used to spend close to
just $5 I&#39;m sure you you would be
surprised how is that possible son I
just explained you have a lot of places
I hitchhiked which i think is a great
way to get from point A to B and it&#39;s
boring you see at many of the places
that&#39;s me hitchhiking in emotions I use
couchsurfing to stay wherever I went I
would have to knock out surfing can you
raise your hand how many of you don&#39;t
know
okay so those who don&#39;t know of it it&#39;s
a hospitality network where you can meet
other travelers and you can send that
request to stay with them so it&#39;s a
great way to meet travelers and a great
way to to cultural exchange so that&#39;s me
with my host Kapoor in Budapest I send
him a couch requesting that I want to
stay at your place and I noticed that he
loves Indian curry so I offered him that
I&#39;ll cook Indian curry for you and that
worked a lot of places during my travels
I my partner so that&#39;s me in a remote
village in Rajasthan and I need that get
a balloon in return of the meat that it
costs so the entire year present world
was full of such incredible experience
and moments and that by the end of the
year I felt that my life is crap with so
many interesting experiences that I said
that I don&#39;t want to go back to
nine-to-five ever again I started
looking for options that how I can
sustain my life of nomadic life of being
on the move and keep traveling the way I
hope in fact so then I feel that they
must give it just working and taking
vacations is not a bully way to live and
I figured that usually for the first
twenty five of years of our life we
spend learning then forty years of our
life we spend working and then at the
end of end of it we retire and most of
us will push our dreams to the
retirement age believe a life of
drudgery making ourselves believe that
maybe we will enjoy a retirement but it
doesn&#39;t happen that a lot of us we we
did for the entire default riding we
read for the entire year for summer and
we fit for the entire land line for
happiness but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the
only way making a living and making a
life doesn&#39;t have to point towards
opposite directions
don&#39;t you think it will be better to
combine work and life together
so I
that one way to combine work and life
together is to be a digital nomad this
Shulamite is a term used for all those
people who leverage technology to work
remotely
while living a nomadic lifestyle so
these are individuals with all different
skill sets a lot of them are developers
designers they&#39;re doctors a lot of
they&#39;ll have made traveling they pretend
job by being a youtuber or social-media
influencer or a blogger and they come
from all different parts of the world so
there are a claps of fish nomads who
work from places like Bali Chiang Mai
Bangkok and and they&#39;re working and
traveling at same time a lot of them
they have they have a full-time job when
they have convinced their boss to allow
them to work remotely a lot of them have
been told by little business to to work
remotely because a lot of businesses
feel that it&#39;s better to allow their
employees to be on the move they can
also save a lot of costs in like office
rent and also they make sure that
employees are
enjoying their life so I feel that
that&#39;s what I need to do if I want to
sustain by nomadic life I have always
been interested into design so excited
visual content design agency impressive
infographics and then the work was no
longer a place for me so this dish
automatic life in Apple mean to travel
to almost 50% we in the next five years
and I had some of the most mind-bending
trips during these years only when I&#39;ve
been to Iran I realize that it&#39;s it&#39;s
just amazing controller things that we
read about this country online is
completely wrong if you read on the
mainstream media audience is Quran in
the unsafe and a lot of countries don&#39;t
advise you to go there but when I went
there it some of the most hospitable
people and I thought gee PC
I thought the best sunset of my life in
Baraka Philippines met Masai people in
Kenya and I pretended to be a Masai
myself I saw the best landscape of my
life in Kyrgyzstan by the way you can&#39;t
take a bad picture and get response just
click anywhere that&#39;s me at the world&#39;s
lowest point on earth any gets very bad
right and that&#39;s me crossing one of the
world&#39;s most remotest fast that is
between Korea and China that&#39;s dedicated
on bus
so it&#39;s this puzzle so we put that on
any single day I need to know how people
go through this path and when I was
going through with with my fellow
intimate friends the occasion of the
Pakistani side he he asked us to wait
wait there and he had so many questions
for us like we spent hours telling our
stories he told me that probably or the
first Indian I am seeing who is crossing
this this border and I told him that it
used to operate many are coming that&#39;s
he was fired this city from the sea
so after living the dishes of Maddock
life I felt that a lot of drink that we
have of going to exotic locations are
giving time for hobbies is not limited
only for the super-rich people if you
make your top people you&#39;ll have access
to all these places evening at the same
time I would like to say that this
lifestyle is not at all perfect there
are some challenges as well for example
if you live in addition imagine life at
times it can be extremely distracting to
work from a very scenic place like a
beautiful landscape you want to happen
to be productive all the time a lot of
times it&#39;s extremely intuitive because
maybe you&#39;ll be meeting a lot of friends
making friends but
end of it you&#39;ll be alone and will have
to be self-motivated in order to keep
keep going a lot of times you&#39;ll have
difficulty explaining your life choices
to dear ones because they are so used to
complete life and they would expect you
to do the same you remember this
this child code whenever we used to do
things that our parents don&#39;t like you a
question is that would you jump off the
bridge if your friends but also the idea
was don&#39;t do stupid things just because
others are weak but as you grow up it&#39;s
like a table is turned when you do
things that you want to they would say
hey everyone is jumping off the bridge
wire and you but remember the real
betrayal is forgetting yourself so don&#39;t
jump off the bridge if you don&#39;t feel
like I&#39;m not sure by now if you have
already made your mind to be rich - no
matter or not I don&#39;t know if this
lesson is suitable for you but I feel
that one way to figure it out is to walk
to the horizon jump off the cliff and
spread your wings on the video
[Applause]
you
