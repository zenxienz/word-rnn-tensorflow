[Music]
okay so I know you have been hearing
stories since morning so I&#39;m not here to
share my story I know Google is with us
we all have our social media profiles
you can easily Google means you&#39;ll find
more details about me I&#39;m here to talk
about something much more important one
year especially last six months it has
been a depressing time in India has
anyone noticed that yeah so what do you
think what has been the depression D
monetization was it really depression
not really you have got so much of money
in the banks GST why has all that
happened do you know that not because of
Modi because of you guys because Modi
was probably concerned about you
[Laughter]
absolutely so you know what has been
happening and you know where the world
is going and where India is going but
but everything is coming to an end for
the start of a new future and the future
is you guys so I wanted to share some
important statistics with you about
what&#39;s happening where are we headed
where&#39;s the world headed and where you
guys should be so first of all you know
about our population I don&#39;t need to
tell you about that do you know about
the literacy rate in India it&#39;s about 74
percent across the country this has
grown drastically 57 percent growth
post-independence when British left us
but but the interesting fact is literacy
rate between 15 and 21 which is the age
group in which you guys are falling is
above 90% and that is expected to go to
98 percent however the concern is jobs
so today I got it all got this topic
from Sameer
how can a million youngsters
collectively create 10 million jobs and
I wanted I want you guys to really think
about it we are not here to build
another Facebook or another Amazon we
know world has been transforming we know
trade is changing we know our
professions are changing but we are
there to do something more substantial
and today I want you to question the
white collar jobs for which we started
expecting we&#39;ll get a job as we graduate
but do we actually get a job have we
been getting jobs what has been the
place track record is something which
needs our attention now I want you to go
slightly reverse way and think about
yourself as a person who&#39;s without a job
and whose
the opportunity to create a job do you
think each of you can create ten jobs or
at least nine jobs or is that a
difficult task do you think you can be
your own entrepreneur or do you think
you want to work for someone now if I
share some more interesting statistics
and and that&#39;s when you&#39;ll get to know
why D monetization happen so in India an
average salary after you graduate is
about fifteen to twenty thousand rupees
this is without a master&#39;s degree if you
actually employ ten people under you you
end up paying two lakh rupees of salad
to them if there are million of you who
do that two lakh rupees of salaries a
month which means a million of you
create about twenty four lakh rupees of
salaries each multiplied by 1 million
people do the math does anyone have that
number no one has that number that&#39;s why
I was saying be attentive and I&#39;m gonna
check your mental maths it turns out to
be 2 lakh 40,000 crore rupees that&#39;s the
that&#39;s the kind of impact you guys can
make by just creating 9 to 10 jobs it
can be by doing anything it can be by
writing it can be by selling something
it can be by setting up a process it can
be anything you don&#39;t need to think
about building the next billion dollar
enterprise you got to just think about
creating 9 to 10 jobs
if you do so that&#39;s gonna be impactful
so I&#39;ll give you a bit of history about
myself now I&#39;ve been an entrepreneur
since the age of 16 so I&#39;m a borderline
graduate I started my first company when
I was still in high school and I was
always concerned about
problem you know I wanted to be my own
boss I wanted to earn good money I
wanted to be a millionaire but was it
easy I started my first venture took me
three years to actually even create a
single job took me three years to even
to get my first check and then what next
after three years I started another
company lost all of that money I was
like shit what do you do
I went bankrupt post that I realized it
it&#39;s not being millionaire what what you
got to aim for you got to be thinking
about thinking about something beyond
money you got to be thinking about the
society you got to be thinking about
doing something good you got to be doing
that with full commitment and passion
and that&#39;s exactly what I did I side my
rest of the ventures with that
commitment with that passion I was able
to create an impact about six years back
I got in a know got an opportunity to
start supporting other entrepreneurs how
do I do that I would go college to go
organize events to inspire people to
startup I would give them a platform
I&#39;ll tell them hey stage is open why
don&#39;t you come forward pitch an idea you
never know it might it might be the next
big idea over a period of time I would
say over three years at least 10,000
people pitched at my events about
thousand companies were born each of
them probably creating eight to ten jobs
eventually but more than that it was
given an opportunity to build a build a
support system for them so I started
building co-working spaces at that point
of time at each of the co-working space
my aim was to foster people like you
shelter them provide them support so
that they are able to work on their
ideas over a period of time what
happened it was all without
money without any support without any
partners all by myself as I side think
the m6e build about six spaces assume he
said all sustaining by on their own each
of them becoming profitable in fifth to
six-month of their operations each of
that space creating at least five to six
for support staff but beyond that each
of them shelters about 70 to 80 people
as a result of that today the entire the
entire network is has about 450 to 500
people these 500 people within
themselves run about 60 companies and
they do a cumulative turnover of about 6
million dollars every year that&#39;s the
impact which you guys can create now
I&#39;ll narrate you another example why I
did that
so 6 years back this was 2011 and I was
operating a place in Greater Kailash one
in New Delhi and I got a hippie
youngster he was just 18 probably 17
looking for a job it was with this
backpack needed a job because he wanted
a place to stay and my myspace provided
that facility as I met him obviously I
couldn&#39;t I didn&#39;t hire him because I
found him to be too young but he pitched
an idea to me it sounded cool and
eventually he ended up living there got
some support he was able to because he
he had the exposure around himself with
all the like-minded people he started
his company you surprised to know that
guy ended up starting up all your rooms
with a shower wall second guy
there are three now there were three
more people who came to my space in the
year 2000 I think 13 these guys had just
quit their job and they said you know we
are trying to restructure the
blue-collared working environment which
is will provide handyman services to
people will try to provide additional
source of livelihood to people I was
like okay idea sounds good
what&#39;s your deal they said we need space
but we cannot afford it we are three
founders we have limited capital so we
rented them our dining table so that
they could work on their ideas and this
company started their operations from
this dining table and one day on this
dining table
they started figuring out the name of
their company guess which company can
that be any guesses that was open clap
yeah so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the impact
today open clap all alone has about 60
thousand skilled workers on their
platform who are anywhere between 20
thousand rupees to fifty thousand rupees
a month and these were the same people
who used to make anywhere between seven
thousand to twelve thousand rupees a
month so an urban clap all alone is able
to create a job for at least 60,000
people and a revenue of about one
hundred and twenty million dollars every
year you can be the next person you can
be doing the same thing or you can do a
smaller set up whatever you decide to do
you go to
you are just start from somewhere and I
think the place to start up is your
campus and it&#39;s time for us to tell the
world that yes we can and we will make
it happen thank you
you
