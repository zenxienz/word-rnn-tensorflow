what a cool introduction well Kyoto Oh
d&#39;etat he is tremendous to be here right
now in this place and our beautiful cool
regenerating and innovative city but I&#39;m
going to take you back three months back
to July 22 July 16 2017 two months
before this incredible general election
that we&#39;ve just had the leader of the
new co-leader at the New Zealand Green
Party Metiria today stands before a
crowd a little bit like this one
she&#39;s got an important role to play on
this day if I tell my story she says we
can start to talk about social welfare
and so she begins her voice crackles
with emotion with the importance of what
is before her what you don&#39;t know about
me she says is that I had to tell a lie
and with those words she reveals that
while studying as a student 15 years
earlier for her law degree she had to
mislead the social welfare authorities
she she didn&#39;t reveal that she had some
flatmates and that meant that if she
receives she received a benefit greater
too than that she was entitled to she
did this in order to feed her baby in
order to live in order to study and stay
well and it&#39;s with these words that she
launches a powerful and visceral
discussion in this country the response
is immediate it&#39;s warm there is an
outpouring of support for Metiria
hashtag I am materia burns hotly on the
Twitter sphere as a trending hashtag
others with stories of hardship with an
ax punitive wealthiest system tell their
story the greens are looking to launch a
new policy suite that they say will mend
the safety net within this country that
will introduce social welfare reform
that will be less punitive that will be
kinder on people in their time of
greatest need
but elsewhere there is a political
trainwreck bearing down another story
has been told and that story has been
told by those with the most to gain from
a weakening of the greens and that&#39;s the
story of Metiria the benefit fraud stir
the woman who wanted to be in power but
had told a lie now we all know how the
story ends the scrutiny upon Metiria and
her family was simply too great and she
was forced to stand down
and we now know of course that the New
Zealand New Zealand Green Party is in
support position and government the most
powerful it has been in its twenty-year
history and we now of course have green
ministers who sit outside cabinet this
must be heartbreaking for Metiria who
worked so hard for so long to represent
the people who she represented as she
packed up her office in the wake of all
of us three caricatures began to emerge
number one
Metiria the victim the victim of sexism
racism and a post-colonial hegemony
number two Metiria the benefit fraud
stir the woman who had lied in order to
gain political capital and caricature
number three was Metiria as the
committed hard-working politician who
had taken a political gamble rolled the
dice and simply got it wrong in every
version of these truths her position had
become untenable but did it need to be
this way could we not have had a better
social discourse around this critically
important topic for New Zealand could we
not have had a discussion that took us
to a kind of place well I think we could
but I think it comes down to all of us
to start to change our behaviors and to
change the way that we enter into social
discourse it&#39;s up to you to me and every
one of us who cares about New Zealand
in the 20 years that I&#39;ve worked as a
journalist I have learned to understand
stand a great deal about all of you I
understand New Zealand audiences I
understand what you read what drives you
to read it and what will make you more
likely to read a piece of content but
also in that time I&#39;ve learned to
understand that an order to understand
New Zealanders you need to understand
those with vastly different viewpoints
than your own but that&#39;s harder than it
ever has been before why because we are
all now living inside these things
called filter bubbles so what&#39;s a filter
bubble terms not mine it was first
coined by social media activists and up
with the CEO
Eli parisa he wrote a great book by the
same name back in 2011 excuse me he also
gave a really super tip talk that I
advise you all jump on and have a look
at after this and in that he said the
internet shows us what we want to see
but what not what we need to see what we
want not what we need and he argued that
it was up to the social media giants who
he called the new gatekeepers to fix the
problem he argued the coders should get
along and do their thing recode the
algorithms so that they were kinder they
allowed a much more socially and
civically engaged conversation his words
were powerful and compelling yet six
years on we are as isolated and divided
as even so what is the filter bubble
well a filter bubble is when readers are
locked into streams of content that
reinforced their ideological viewpoint
and worse prejudices they&#39;ve always
existed back in the old days before the
internet you guys remember that you
won&#39;t write
there was that time and there were these
things called echo chambers and we all
know how they worked it&#39;s when people
listen to one particularly partisan
talkback show and talk back man was
pretty crazy back in those days or read
one particularly partisan print
publication but increasingly filter
bubbles are created by the very
technology upon which we have become
reliant and addicted social media feeds
that spoon feeds us content that is
targeted at an audience of one hyper
relevant to our lives hyper connected
and we quite like that because it&#39;s
content that we relate to our technology
also connects us to others who share the
same view and again continues to
reinforce those same ideologies it&#39;s
been proven that the content that we
received through our social media feeds
can even impact our moods and within
those types of environments very quickly
viewpoints become truths and this has
been proven with alarming efficiency in
the past 12 months
millions of people many of us in this
room I&#39;m sure felt blindsided by the
election of Donald Trump and by brexit
why because we never looked outside our
own viewpoint to see these massive
social movements that were coming
towards us on the eve of the u.s.
election the New York Times which I
absolutely adore was predicting with a
high probability a Clinton when I
believed them and so did my Facebook
feed because it was full of content by
people who believed it to be true and
wished it to be so man they let me down
and we all know what that looks like now
the documentary more maker Michael Moore
put it best when he said we were all
inside our bubbles and we didn&#39;t pay
attention to our fellow Americans didn&#39;t
pay
tenshun ouch and when we&#39;re in that
situation we were not paying attention
or we&#39;re not attempting to understand
and look through the eyes of others
there&#39;s another problem that can emerge
we start to shout at one another and
even worse we shout past one another and
this creates a situation we were not
attempting to gain an understanding of
our fellow man there&#39;s a really
interesting u.s. commentator by the name
of Bret Stevens he was over he&#39;s got
some pretty extreme views and he has no
shout and no stranger to being shouted
down he was over in Australia last month
and he talked to a press freedom for him
and there he said he argued that we&#39;ve
lost the ability to constructively
disagree and he put it like this he said
we no longer ever we&#39;re no longer not
only have our own opinions we have our
own facts and I think there&#39;s another
term for that alternative facts and we
knew what we all know where that goes to
this place called fake news and we
shouldn&#39;t assume that we are in any way
immune in this country social media
penetration in New Zealand is wide and
deep and I&#39;m sure many of you would be
on social media right now had you all
been not told to turn your phone&#39;s off
last month 2.7 million New Zealanders
logged on to Facebook here in Canterbury
three hundred and twenty thousand of us
logged on last month and when we did we
clicked to refresh an average of 19
times per day that kind of penetration
is matched only by Google and stuff
cotton said in this country so you can
start to see how very quickly we become
locked into very narrow sources of
content now Facebook itself has
knowledge acknowledged the extent of
this issue earlier this year Mark
Zuckerberg wrote a bit of a treatise on
this and he talked about how Facebook
could become that place which is safe
and kind and helps people in
and civil conversations he argued that
Facebook could help in some of the
isolation that technology had created
other technology companies are also
having a go at fixing this problem and
you can now get apps that you can plug
into your browser that will help refill
to your social feeds to expose you to a
greater range of content and the media
companies take it really seriously - I
know because I have obviously worked as
an editor all of the mainstream media
companies in this country work really
hard to present a diversity of
viewpoints and new entrants into the
market are also filling in venetie&#39;s
internationally the New York Times
BuzzFeed Huffington Post and others all
introduce new content in the wake of the
u.s. election acknowledging the problems
that had occurred and to help people
read across the aisle but I argue the
fastest way to get outside your filter
bubble is to do it yourself
the power is in our hands so my call to
action today is not to the social media
giants it&#39;s not to the editors who
create content on your behalf it&#39;s to
you reach outside your filter bubble and
pop it yourself if we all take steps to
do this then we start to engage in a far
more constructive conversation so what
are the steps step number one awareness
know that there&#39;s a problem and it&#39;s our
obligation to fix it
step number two acceptance accept the
rights of others to have viewpoints that
differ from your own it&#39;s really really
good thing diversity of viewpoint and
freedom of expression are fundamental to
a safe society step number three listen
well and read widely seek out the views
of others seek the views of the
journalists who you hate listen to the
commentators who have views that are
vastly different than your own and
you&#39;re all going to grow in when I say
this but read the comments on the bottom
of stories
now there is a diversity of viewpoint a
tapestry of views sitting there waiting
to be absorbed step number four read
those comments and then critically
analyze them take the time to pay
attention to those views of others and
even be prepared to take on some of
those view points where critical
analysis gives them validity and step
number five and this I think is the most
important of all never shout or sneer at
others before you seemed there oh so
clever that caustic tweet think again
don&#39;t assume that your viewpoint comes
from a place of kindness and others are
harsh and uncaring think again don&#39;t
assume that the strength of your
conviction gives you the right to shout
at another think again take the time to
respond a little differently with
greater empathy and when you do this you
may just find that someone reaches back
and you start to engage in a far more
constructive conversation this is why I
will often take the time to log on to
blocks of those with whom I often wildly
disagree I&#39;m not going to name them now
but there are certainly a great there is
a great diversity of viewpoint available
not because I think that these
polemicists will drive me to my true
north but because I want to understand
the viewpoint and I love them why
because they are us they and New
Zealanders these are the people we work
with we shop with we ride buses with and
most importantly we vote with and until
we understand that diversity of
viewpoint we can&#39;t possibly hope to
understand our community so I invite all
of you today to reach out to pop your
filter bubble and when you do you will
find that we are starting to talk about
the areas that we share rather than
where we differ we will start to find we
are building common conversations and
working together to solve the problems
that our community faces when we do that
we start to look through the eyes of
others and we have truly popped our
filter bubble to the benefit of a
stronger safer kinder community pop your
filter bubble today thank you
[Applause]
you
