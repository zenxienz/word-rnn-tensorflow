[Applause]
thank you so I like to start with our
new games trailer which is going to be
launched on 16 December 2017
[Music]
[Music]
thank you so like you know just from the
video you guys can guess two things one
is we make games more specifically we
make so like the first thing is we make
games and more specifically we make
mobile games we exclusively work for our
mobiles right now working on Android
platform the second thing is we are
building a game on which is the theme is
in 1971 but whenever I go to an event
one of the thing that confuses people is
they tend to think that we are only
about 1971 but which is not correct so
like this is like you know me
my co-founder who is not here is
actually quite ill so please pray for
him so our goal is to bring and English
Bengalis into mobile games with the
content they love so you might like you
guys might ask why would we want to
bring like you know Bengalis into mobile
games so like you know so to answer that
first I want to go back to like the
Bangla part right so our beloved
language this is actually like the sixth
most spoken language globally if you
consider native speakers with 242
million native speakers and will be very
rich heritage right we have like the
first Nobel laureate of subcontinent is
actually like an otaku and from there on
like we have very like you know very
steady stream of quality intellectual
people but and as a millennial right you
know we all grew up reading Bengali
books like you know for me like I&#39;m like
actually like you know I have many but I
have picked three so one is she shuns
mukha birthday he is like you know
stories like actually there are 42 books
and they give me a very good picture
about rural Bangladesh when I was
growing up as a kid
and then like in this failure and caca
would they take us to like you know
different exotic places and like you
know shoonoon gangopadhyay is like there
are three books right Shh oh my poor
thermal oh and puro question these three
books actually taught me history like in
a way that no other history books can
but right now what we see is it like
disconnect like we as Millennials like
people who grew up in the 90s we
actually had a system in sports and like
you know we were connected and like it
comes to books then what is very rich
like I can also be like music but we
like the problem that we&#39;re facing right
now is like you know opportunity for the
next generation the one we call like you
know generation zip and like we started
night I was actually watching a video
from like you know snaps event and then
they were saying is like you&#39;re there
now like having this problem that this
the engineers from the only has three to
five second attention span so you have
to make your content like you know it
used to pop out into the five seconds
which is very difficult and like things
like books right now it doesn&#39;t really
work on this generation opportunity so
we should be worried about is like you
know the Guardian Valley language
it actually has failed to transform into
the digital age you see in like new
Google Apps II only three are from like
you know actually top 20 they&#39;re only
three from local developers and like you
know if you like and the biggest problem
is the interactive media right then like
you know if you look at the youngster
the thing like most easy for me to the
connection is games that will give 0 an
iPad and they can like do this
immediately start a game and there we
have the biggest problem like in the
least what you see is like the top three
games actually somewhat like local
context but like it open there&#39;s only
one game which is maybe one of the
developers and like you know these other
games like movies are sort of based on
our culture is made by other people so
if we don&#39;t like you know start
developing our own
someone else to do so that&#39;s one like
you know so I think it&#39;s like the good
thing is there is demand we launched our
first two games hero 71 in retaliation
in like you know 2016 and like actually
like you know 16 December 2015 and the
next one was March 2016 and we got like
5.6 million unique users in two games
without actually spending anything on
marketing it was like completely viral
and to be honest the games were a leg of
good standard but it was not like
hundred percent national standard and
people still like you know played the
game and what still surprises us is like
even till now like we have around more
than three hundred thousand like you
know monthly active users like for the
September we had three hundred thirty
thousand active users and like you know
every month we have more than sixteen
human like you know here people like you
know spend in the games and we have
86,000 reviews in Google Play so that
got us thinking that like you know that
if we can make like you know something
that is close to interval standard and
this gets like good response from more
people like such a good response what
will actually happen if we build
something which is truly like in a
global standard and like another part
which is like you know outside game is
like you know our games it also got in
terms of the attention it&#39;s not only
like the game like you know people in
mahadesh they loved our games they
played our games they&#39;re still playing
our games but you also got her internal
attention but the interesting thing is
it&#39;s not for the reason that you would
think they&#39;d got the attention for none
of the internal media actually focus on
the game itself
they actually focused on the political
side of things like you know the okay so
these Bengali guy is they made a game
and they&#39;re actually killing Pakistanis
that&#39;s the only thing like you know they
deducted from the whole game and
economists wrote an article they didn&#39;t
even mention how the game is they just
say it like you know this is wrong so
like you know do that like an hour like
you know question is like whenever
someone is making a game on Second World
War
no one is asking these sort of questions
like you know that you know hey you know
why this is happening and we got very
strange questions asked to ourselves
like you know that what happens if like
you know someone from Pakistan developed
a game like that to that like in our
answer was like you know would it feel
nice
you feel like you know German like game
development company develop the game
where Nazis are many wins and then like
you know the answer is like you know the
situations are not the same to which we
are very surprised and like you know
even if now you like you know do Google
like who are of 1971 the first thing
that will come up is indo-pakistan war
of 1971 and those of us like you know
who actually lived abroad they will know
that people actually think that you know
the 1971 our independence was I don&#39;t
want to use the like you know term but
they sort of think of it as a by-product
which is certainly not true and it&#39;s on
us to change that like situation and
like you know for us as a game developer
we think making games can help so that&#39;s
one of the other reason that we are
making games on 1971 so a second video
and like you know this is another video
like every time we get asked this
question that are we teaching violence
in everything to the kids when it&#39;s
exclusively like you don&#39;t show any
Bloods or anything in our game
[Music]
so like you know from this video right
you know what we have seen like after
making the first two games is like you
know people from all over Bangladesh
from like you know dhaka kids to like
you know people from like forest poor we
have seen people playing the game so
what we have decided is like in which
also our responsibility to try to like
you know insert some of the filth
realities of Bangladesh like to people
so here you see like you know one person
actually like you know trying to like
you know to farming right so 1917 we
tend to forget like you know we try to
minimize the whole thing by like you
know if you don&#39;t fighters fighting like
you know Pakistan army but there are
like you know what I think is like apart
from few people who collaborated
Pakistan everyone else or the freedom
fighters somewhat like some people had
the like you know opportunity to like
you know go and fight some people
actually helped and give them shelter so
we are like in our next game we are
trying to incorporate all these things
into our games like you know as a pair
you just don&#39;t have to fight you have to
actually like you know provide support
to the of like you know freedom fighters
and everything next one
[Music]
so like you know as we have mentioned
that we we think that this is our
responsibility to like you know show
like Bangladesh in a positive way even
though like you know the game is set on
a wire like environment so this is like
you know early like in a prototype of
our map how it will look in the game and
like you know we really want to portray
a beautiful Bangladesh so these are the
like you know first like first few
actually like you know artistic
impression of the game and like in this
game will have more than 40 characters
and each character you can actually
customize like you know the way you want
to and like another like element that we
have incorporated is like you know we
really work with our fans like through
Facebook and like what we are seeing is
like you know we are a small team we are
only a team of like 28 people trying to
make one of the like you know the
biggest game in Bangladesh so like we
get a lot of help from our like users so
every time like you know we do some art
or anything like you can see a mundane
art here and like you know there was
like more than 10,000 people reacted on
the art and we received like hundreds of
comments so what we have done so far is
like you know to incorporate a system by
which every day we upload whatever we&#39;re
doing on our game and we see the user
base right they actually give us like
input and in few cases they actually
give us very good input like here you
see the flag right like in the first
like like you know art we actually like
mistakenly like you know put the actual
flag of Bangladesh right now which is
not correct because in 71 we use this
flag and our fans actually pointed that
out to us that you know this is the
wrong flag and like in every sort of
research they are actually like our fans
are actually doing the research for us
so that&#39;s a big achievement for us so
like the takeaway so like the three
points I want to make one is like you
know make local content like it&#39;s not
only games we have a big gap of local
content recently Bioscope came out it&#39;s
a good move
I now see these are giving us a few
hopes but we believe there are there&#39;s a
big gap in local content generation and
like you know it&#39;s not only games it can
be cartoon it can be like you know
comics anything second is like organic
beer like coming back to the second
point like as there are very few good
local content so if you actually make
decent content you will get very good
traction people will recognize and they
will really help you so that&#39;s another
great chance
the third is talent pool definitely as
these sort of things are new in
Bangladesh if you are the first mover
you will be able to get like really good
talents which like you know you may say
like you know in abroad like let&#39;s say
in India right we get these arts like
you know question asked a lot like in
India they have talent so how will you
like you know develop to that what I say
is like you know like they have eight
times more population but hundred times
more competition they have more than 200
game studios in Bangalore itself in
Dhaka they&#39;re only few so it&#39;s very easy
for us to get great talent so it&#39;s time
to like you know work and the last
question people might say that local
content is not monetizable which is
still up like like you know like pain
point for us but things are changing so
our like you know ecosystem is
developing and I believe like you know
things will go great thank you
[Applause]
