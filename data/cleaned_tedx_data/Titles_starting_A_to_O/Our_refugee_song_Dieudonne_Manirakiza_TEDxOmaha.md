everyone on this stage has a journey
story to tell yeah but we only have 13
minutes but I&#39;m going to share my my
began in a tiny country in East Africa
called Burundi my family Fred this
turned violent on land heading to a
refugee camp in the middle of the jungle
in Tanzania although we were safe within
a camp the place had its own challenges
the little food we had was awful there
was never enough water for drinking or
bathing we walked miles and miles to
gather firewood for cooking and
sometimes some of us never made it back
despite all these challenges Sunday
morning was a day I was always looking
forward to that&#39;s when I heard the music
of church I this music will take me away
from hunger and all the struggles were
facing I was fired through a crowd to
make it to the front and next to a choir
where I can see the main the Hinton&#39;s of
the man who is playing piano his music
inspired me and wished wanted to be a
piano player someday his music will take
me away from so much I finally after 12
long years in this refugee camp we were
accepted in four United States our
dreams our hopes were finally coming
true
[Applause]
our imagination didn&#39;t quite match up
with reality we found now we have we
have left our families our friends
languages and culture everything we knew
we had nothing until one day one
American man asked me what can i buy for
you without even hesitating as a piano
right when he brought me that black
Akashi I took it and I remained I ran
into my room and exactly that moment
immediately my hands started going and
doing exactly what the mana church had
been doing for so long and I would try
to find the chords every time I find the
right chords I&#39;ll get so excited and my
family who got around was seeing happy
songs I&#39;m that moment it would take away
from all the problems were facing here
at that moment surely two years after
many refugees and Burundians I started
coming in Omaha one thing come in they
all had the kids were having troubles to
adjust so I said music music let&#39;s play
some songs let&#39;s get together we started
as seven kids and just playing it we
have grown to a community to where we
have more than five countries and
refugees here we see we&#39;re all refugees
who have Fred of violence and looking
for a safe of our families we have so
much to offer though the experiences
such as engineering education medicine
including the music where that binds us
all together in pure joy we are doing
today so I hope that you enjoyed the our
next piece thank you
