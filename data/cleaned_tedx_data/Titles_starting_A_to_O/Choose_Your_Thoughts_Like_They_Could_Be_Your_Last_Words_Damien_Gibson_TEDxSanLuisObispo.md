fire in our hearts truth in our eyes so
choose your thoughts like they could be
your last word
[Music]
your lives were one creation one love I
can&#39;t let it go cuz nobody is ever torn
apart we&#39;re all one people one heart
beating strong stronger by the second we
are back to back hold each other up make
it through the storm like this rough
plan we are not in this alone
once it always connected so please stop
the war looking in the mirror both sides
of the quarrel over standing true
replace it with love that of which is
unconditional creek&#39; dreams rise above
redevelop what was lost expansion of
consciousness realigned with the Stars
we&#39;ve realized this is not a race to
Mars more like a race to see there is no
racing off on us
[Music]
that wishes if I don&#39;t let it pass you
by that clouds around these new beats we
climb fire in our hearts truth in our
eyes so choose your thoughts like they
could be your last ones you hope you
need for minds that which are divine
don&#39;t let them pass us by like clouds
around these new beats we climb fiery
rockers truth in our words so choose
your thoughts like they could be your
last word like they could be your last
[Music]
no paste-like homes they sit around and
wait for their dreams to be actual
summer tactical about it and reach out
to the factual but don&#39;t get me wrong
dream is what can keep us from that
rabbit hole seem so often in my mind of
work though dreams turn into obstacles
yes probable causes for the masses to
wander and gather them up in the back
alley way straight slide at the youth
fine line between genius lies an insane
truth what do I do with some of my time
will I write rhymes to save lives trying
to change the times were living in
before I die cuz I&#39;ve witnessed the
cries of kids in institutions that this
messed up corrupt cookie-cut system uses
to confuse the so ludicrous that they do
this when the youth is the only chance
we had for the righteous future but
still water that we drink is so polluted
fluoride and chromium six your fire get
used to it underlined words emerge from
a closed book get it descriptively
inflicted multiple bars no hook waiting
but chasing dreams at our station every
obstacles probably illogical but gifted
with the follow-through were
metaphorically opening doors to the last
row subconsciously watching but dropping
what&#39;s past to bigger ups picking up
they hold it back as a tool so they can
watch your squirm around like
experiments in a tube so I don&#39;t tune
into that TV no another way that they
play with you devised scheme so that
people think they hold the keys to but
the lies lead to the eyes of the teens
they&#39;ve reached you in time just another
invented sedative meant to keep you from
the idea a life lives can be something
to see through so speak to the youth
utilize the population that exceeds you
or the unused potential be the demon
that defeats you
[Music]
we hope you did for minds that which are
defined don&#39;t let them pass us by like
clouds Romney&#39;s new beats we climb fire
in our hearts truth in our eyes so
choose your thoughts like they could be
your last word
[Applause]
