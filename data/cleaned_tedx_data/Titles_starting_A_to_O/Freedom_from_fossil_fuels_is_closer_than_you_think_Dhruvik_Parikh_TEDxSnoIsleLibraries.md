as a young person with hopefully a long
future lifetime ahead the picture
painted by climate change was really
concerning to me and I wanted to do
something about it now you might be
wondering what can a high schooler do to
help address climate change and to be
completely honest with you I had
absolutely no idea either but
fortunately for me I had signed up for
the intro to science and engineering
research class in my freshman year of
high school in this class each student
selects a topic of research that
interests them and spends the air doing
background research planning and running
experiments and presenting their
research in written and oral forms for
me I felt the most dire and urgent need
was to do research relating to energy
specifically renewable energy my work
was with the concept called energy
independence often when we hear this
term it&#39;s in relation to the oil crisis
in the Middle East coal and oil plants
in the US and protectionist trade
ideologies well I&#39;m here to show you
that there is another definition of
energy independence specifically
communities and cities can come together
and harness renewable energy within
their regions allowing them to become
self-sustaining this way the motivation
for independence isn&#39;t political but
instead environmental and economic
moreover the costs to both our wallets
and the environment that arise from the
production transportation and usage of
fossil fuels can be reduced technologies
such as solar panels wind and
hydroelectric are considered to be the
future of energy because we don&#39;t have
to deplete any physical resources to
take advantage of them and they don&#39;t
emit nearly as much carbon into the
atmosphere when we think about these
next generation energy sources people
often like to pit them against each
other
in a competition of sorts to see which
will be the one that saves us all but
really after working with the variety of
these energy technologies over the past
few years I&#39;ve learned that there is no
one that is effective in every situation
but instead each has potential to be
used in some location and at some scale
for my research project I worked with
biomass which is basically plant matter
that can be processed into usable fuels
currently most of the biomass energy we
use today comes from corn or soybeans
that are planted specifically for the
purpose of being converted to energy but
it&#39;s also possible to use plant matter
that we are already producing such as
agricultural waste I started by looking
into these different agricultural waste
products and what options we have to
recycle them it turns out that the waste
of the wine production process which is
basically the stems skins and seeds of
grapes doesn&#39;t have any specific use so
I decided to put it to use by making it
into a plant-based fuel called biodiesel
which can be used in any diesel engine
if winemakers use their waste to create
this fuel it can be used in the
equipment and machinery for the next
batch and then the whole process can
repeat this is called a closed loop and
it&#39;s a concept that really drew me in I
was fascinated by how the waste of some
process could eventually become the fuel
for that same process I learned from
this that on a small scale energy can be
individualized so that one doesn&#39;t have
to be reliant on the grid and fossil
fuels to come up with their energy this
applies in a variety of situations from
the winemakers I was working with two
other farm owners who have waste plant
matter to everyday individuals who
harness renewable energy from their
homes the following year I decided that
I wanted to do research again I was
still really interested in off-grid
energy storage but I wanted to explore
how this would work on a larger scale
than just a
farm or home into something like a
village or small town I was satisfied
with the progress I had made on the wine
waste biodiesel and so I decided to
switch gears to society this cooperative
energy system to put this in perspective
say if we could implement an isolated
energy system in communities where
energy is harvested in energy farms and
then stored in within the community or
nearby there would be very little
transportation cost and the community
could share the costs associated with
maintaining and operating the systems
this is especially interesting in
developing countries where there are
many villages that are not yet connected
to the grid if they had a system where
they could collectively utilize solar
and other renewable forms of energy and
store it within their village they could
essentially leapfrog all the
developmental steps that come with the
electrical grid moving from a big
picture vision to a doable research
project I wanted to study how energy
storage could be combined with another
problem faced by many around the world
access to clean water to do this I
incorporated a hydrogen fuel cell into a
solar water purification device this
runs using the principle of
photocatalysis which is when a special
material called a catalyst is submerged
in water and when exposed to a light
source like the Sun it&#39;s able to split
water into its component hydrogen and
oxygen gases this hydrogen gas can then
be routed through a hydrogen fuel cell
which generates electricity that the
village can use and then after this the
hydrogen is recombined with the oxygen
to form pure h2o or water at the same
time the photocatalysis reactions also
work on breaking apart other molecules
in the initial water sample which means
that toxic compounds can be degraded and
bacteria can be killed this sounds great
in theory but unfortunately I wasn&#39;t
able to get very conclusive results
experimentally but still from the
background research I read and
conversations I had with professionals
working with similar technologies I
learned that this concept
of a whole community having its own
collective renewable energy system is
actually quite feasible and some even
exist today
for example the coronal ultra-mega solar
park is a solar farm in India that
encompasses over 10 square miles the
solar energy harness here is enough to
meet the electricity demands of over 4
million people across 6,000 square miles
of mostly rural land these people don&#39;t
have to rely on coal transported from
far away and burned with carbon
emissions to generate their electricity
you don&#39;t have to be on your own to
achieve the dream of energy independence
you can actually still be
environmentally friendly and low-cost by
producing energy centrally within your
region so taking a step back at this
point we&#39;ve covered that on scales
ranging from individuals to whole
communities energy can be captured
stored and used communally but the
United Nations reports that over 54% of
the world&#39;s population lives in urban
areas and a whopping 81% of Americans do
according to the census in these big
cities there simply isn&#39;t enough space
to build large-scale energy farms so
what can all of these people do to be
energy independent well just because
there isn&#39;t one continuous expanse of
space doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t
space at all instead of having one place
where energy can be harnessed households
and firms can use their own means to
generate electricity and then share it
with their neighbors the problem here is
that unlike coal and oil which have
natural physical forms that they can be
stored in renewable energy needs to be
stored in something like a battery one
proposed solution is by using
large-scale batteries in power plants to
store renewable energy these are called
redox flow batteries they&#39;re very
efficient and offer great modularity the
main obstacle preventing their
implementation is currently caught
and the main problem component is the
membrane that separates the positive and
negative sides of the battery because I
had gained a working understanding of
electrochemistry for my work with the
hydrogen fuel cells it was a natural
transition for me to begin studying
these batteries this last year I&#39;ve been
working with researchers at the
University of Washington to develop a
low-cost membrane from readily available
materials and the initial results are
very promising the hope is that once the
science behind the battery is worked out
it can be implemented in cities and
renewable energy produced by households
and firms can be stored in these
batteries until it is distributed back
to customers so thinking about the three
systems I&#39;ve described the waste energy
our closed-loop system the central
renewable energy production and the
shared energy storage what they all have
in common is that they help us achieve
energy independence this would greatly
reduce our dependency on fossil fuels in
the environmental and economic costs
associated with them there would be no
need for building long pipe lines or
cleaning up oil spills or fighting wars
over oil reserves but before any of this
can become a reality the government and
corporations need to see that this
future is what the citizens actually
want by using our voice as consumers and
investing in technologies like solar
panels we can incentivize corporations
to put more money into developing the
necessary infrastructure I think that if
you look around with this perspective
you can find surprising ways to
contribute to this energy plan in your
daily lives it might be investing in
technologies such as solar panels
yourself there are a variety of free
online tools that can help you gauge if
your house and roof orientation are
optimized for solar and how much it
would cost you to switch even in Western
Washington where we can go weeks without
a single sunny day the technology has
advanced to the point where we can still
use solar panels efficiently here
I encourage all of you to explore these
options as you can really be surprised
at how affordable they truly can be
another option is to use your voice as
citizens to talk to policymakers about
incentivizing closed-loop energy systems
like solar to both corporations and
consumers this can be the financial
boost we need to get even more people
excited about trying out renewables a
third option which is my personal
favorite is to engage in research
projects of your own you don&#39;t innate
you don&#39;t need any special
qualifications or equipment to get into
it and some of the most important
discoveries have been made in just
everyday people&#39;s garages and plus it
can be a lot of fun I&#39;m living proof
that even without a formal scientific
education and huge amounts of funding
and backing you can make real
contributions to research just by taking
the initiative to look around and ask
questions an energy independent future
where people at every scale can
sustainably harness renewable energy is
just within reach and I invite you all
to join me in grasping it thank you very
much
