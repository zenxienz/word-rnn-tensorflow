that&#39;s me
and who&#39;s this who recognizes this man
any idea little hint former US president
oh very good very good my students think
Bill Clinton no bachelor students older
hey Rosa vote very correct known from a
night in the museum the movie which is a
very strange claim to fame for a u.s.
president but that&#39;s how most people
recognize him anyway in 1912 he wanted
to be reelected as a US president and
back in those days of course they didn&#39;t
have television they didn&#39;t even have a
radio if you wanted to be US president
you had to travel from city to city and
the only means of advertisement was a
brochure there we see it with the image
printed on it now they just wanted to
leave they have printed three million
brochures and we&#39;re ready to leave and
then somebody from the campaign team saw
something terrible on it
not the face but the writing moffat
Studios Chicago in other words a certain
mr. Moffet from Chicago held the rights
to that image and they totally forgotten
to speak to him so they had a crisis
meeting and one of them said hey what
are we gonna do
moffat has all the power once said hey
you know what let&#39;s just do it anyway
just not in Chicago probably have to pay
a little fine but the fine would have
been three million $1 per unauthorized
copy and of course scandal so they
didn&#39;t do that they came up with a
different solution which I will tell you
about at the end of my talk power that&#39;s
the topic negotiation power tell you a
little story I teach at Munich Business
School and across the street we have a
little snack bar and it&#39;s called
it&#39;s run by a guy called Giovanni and
the place is called javonni&#39;s both said
oh awesome a name that is impossible to
translate because it&#39;s very Bavarian so
Giovanni stands there in front of his
boat side wasa and he waves at me every
morning is a very nice guy he doesn&#39;t
have any power
over me but the moment I approach him
and say hey Giovanni because he knows
pizza he started selling pizza but years
ago and it&#39;s really good and if I said
hey Jimmy I need the recipe for a pizza
because there&#39;s a pizza contest all of a
sudden he has power over me and the more
important this competition is for me the
more power he has
so Giovanni is the same it&#39;s just me and
my perception of Giovanni now let&#39;s say
he has a son call him Mario I should I
asked him before this talk and he does
have a son who is called Mario sometimes
and so he has a son called Mario and for
Mario when Mario was five or six
Giovanni is the most powerful person on
the planet because he tells the one to
go to bed what to eat when to get up
everything now as far as I know Mario is
about 20 years old
Angelo honey is not so powerful anymore
but Giovanni&#39;s the same now if I see you
do I have any power over you not reaiiy
could ruin your next 15 minutes or so if
I were boring yes certain power now
usually I have executives here for about
two days and I train them in negotiation
so they have paid already and they you
know took two days off so I have more
power but if you were students I&#39;d have
even more power because I would grade
you but let&#39;s say there are 100 students
sitting here for each and every student
the perception of my power is different
probably one of them is very wealthy he
doesn&#39;t care he&#39;s just sitting there
somebody else probably is the only one
from a very remote village who could
study on university he walks to Munich
Business School barefoot every morning
uphill probably the way back also a
built and to him I&#39;m a god-like figure
because I could really make the
difference he feels the urge to bring me
refreshments and beverages doing class
hasn&#39;t happened yet but hopefully one
nature
so to all these students sitting there
to all these people they have a
different perception of power let&#39;s
imagine you meet the CEO you see the CEO
of your company in a restaurant and you
see why powerful guy and your friend is
there I say who&#39;s that fat guy said well
it&#39;s a seal so so the power is not in
him it&#39;s in your perception and that is
the idea of power in a negotiation that
there is no power there&#39;s only the
perception of power which is inside of
you and I&#39;ll show you a more extreme
example of another gentleman Jim
Stockdale Jim Stockdale was a US soldier
during the Vietnam War and he was
captured by the Viet Cong was put in a
Cell and one night something happened
they rattled on his cell I just open it
was war after all and very polite and
they said something you never want to
hear when you&#39;re in a jail cell
they said you face and that is why you
will play the starring role in a
propaganda movie against the United
States tomorrow morning and he sat down
in his stool they closed the door what
power did this guy have well he thought
for a while then he took the stool and
smashed his face and he smashed it again
and again until it was a bloody mess
not a good image for a propaganda movie
which was never shot he was actually in
prison for over seven years and he
survived and later he he said that that
night he cried in his cell not because
of the pain probably not only because of
the pain but he said that for the first
time in all these years he felt powerful
and he regained his confidence well he
survived he became a Vice Admiral and
went to politics few years ago a u.s.
senator was running going for a jog on
Capitol Hill wearing a nice watch and
somebody came with the international
symbol you can turn off him
with the international symbol for power
a loaded gun he said give me a watch and
he said Wow very nice good to see you
because you know I have cancer I&#39;m
terminally ill I wanted to commit
suicide anyway but then my wife wouldn&#39;t
collect the life insurance so please
just you know shoot you do all of us a
great favor and you can just remove the
watch easily it&#39;s a little tricky but I
would manage so the Robert was probably
standing there looking at the guy
looking at his gun scratching his head
and just walked off so the senator
wasn&#39;t sick with little ruse but I think
it was quite justified so why am I
telling you this this story about James
Stockdale this story about the senator
because sometimes we face a loaded gun
in a negotiation we&#39;re scared we think
the other one is so much more powerful
he has all the more options we are
looking for a job we&#39;re looking we&#39;re at
the bank looking for a loan so we see
this loaded gun and no matter where I am
because I worked a lot for cars
suppliers they said how we&#39;re facing
Daimler and Audia then I worked for
these big companies and they didn&#39;t feel
like gods they said we have to you know
we need our supplies we can&#39;t build cars
the union&#39;s think the big bosses run the
factories then I work for the big bosses
in union contracts big bosses don&#39;t feel
like big bosses they think we don&#39;t have
any power
we&#39;re employees ourselves we have two
year contracts the media is against us
the courts are against us we are nothing
so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to tell you
that we only see the other guys loaded
gun and it&#39;s the same in every
negotiation so before you face a
negotiation and we don&#39;t have much time
there&#39;s not a training it&#39;s just a
little talk but you have to ask yourself
what is the worst thing that can happen
what&#39;s the worst thing this guy could do
to you it&#39;s gonna kill you probably not
if you&#39;re not imprisoned in a Vietcong
cell and probably is not going to happen
if it&#39;s just a negotiation what&#39;s the
worst thing you can always go home
watch Netflix probably even show if
you&#39;re a little lucky it&#39;s okay right
and especially live in Germany or in a
western country nothing really bad is
gonna happen
you can always rely on welfare yeah and
you know welfare pays Netflix ten euros
a month that&#39;s fine that&#39;s the worst
thing that can happen eat spaghetti all
day okay it&#39;s not that bad so if you
imagine this and usually a negotiation
it&#39;s much better it&#39;s not even that bad
so there is no power in a negotiation
it&#39;s only the perception of power so
let&#39;s go back to the first gentleman
Teddy Roosevelt what happened in that
very instance well the head of the
election campaign came and said Moffett
doesn&#39;t have any power you think he has
a power but he doesn&#39;t we have all the
power because he doesn&#39;t know about it
so he sent Moffett a telegram and said
hey we are the campaign team of the old
and new US president we&#39;re planning to
print 3 million brochures and we&#39;re
looking for a great photograph would be
great advertisement for the photographer
how much would you be willing to pay us
if we chose yours you have eight hours
because they had to leave almost
immediately
can the reply I&#39;ve never done anything
like that but under these circumstances
I would be willing to pay you $250 I&#39;m
sure they could have negotiated it up
with a certain negotiation adviser but
they were nice and hey Moffett got the
advertisement of his life over 100 years
later we still talked about him so
that&#39;s what the thought I want to leave
you with in any negotiation in any
argument there is no power there is only
the perception of power because you are
the source of all power I wish you great
deals thank you very much
you
