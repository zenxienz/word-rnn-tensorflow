chill or Chi Hiroshi strana I have been
living here in you know chrome for about
two months and I I have fallen in love
with the people the the traditions
everybody&#39;s very nice everybody is very
polite and I am I&#39;m very happy to be
here okay so let&#39;s do it
so I want to tell you a little bit about
assessment I hope that you guys can like
this presentation I know that maybe when
you&#39;re thinking about being a teacher
sometimes we think okay assessment is
this evil machinery that we have to give
students so that you know is you know
sometimes as as teachers within
assessment is bad but also it is
unnecessary thing well I remember when I
was a teacher in the u.s. I started
teaching my students I heard about
assessment I hear about that we needed
to to have students the scores would be
higher because it has to do with money
has to do with a lot of things but
anyway after after I was teaching for a
few years I had the chance to
participate in assessment in how in
high-stakes large-scale assessment for
several states and then I realized I
understood how complex assessment is so
whenever you see your students taking
under standardized tests such as TOEFL
IELTS etc yes it may imagine a difficult
assessment but a lot of work went into
that it&#39;s very difficult to create an
assessment and I really encourage you as
teachers you&#39;re going to have a very
very long path in your life as a
teachers but if you get an opportunity
to be involved in assessed
in creating assessments either here in
Ukraine or anywhere in the world please
do it because you&#39;re going to you&#39;re
going to learn a lot and it&#39;s a very
satisfying thing because you actually
you can be in a position where you can
be a teacher and you can say okay I&#39;m
going to put my teaching soul into these
and I&#39;m gonna make sure I create the
best assessment I could do and this is
again for for the kids anyway so I&#39;m
gonna tell you very quickly about a
project that I have done in the past and
there is a new trend in in the US and
this is the implementation of formative
assessment formative assessment is very
important because it allows teachers to
gather data to gather systematic data
and then make decisions about how to
improve our curriculum how to improve
our teaching so as a formative
assessment is very important so you can
see my my definition there now
everybody I assume here knows or have
have heard about this famous linguist
called Jim Cummins Jim Cummins if I am
not mistaken he&#39;s from the University of
Vancouver he&#39;s a very well known
linguist in in the US he has done a lot
of very important work so as you can see
this is his famous quadrant a schema for
teaching so as you can see on the on
quadrant a we have something called
context embedded and cognitively on
demanding tasks so all of the speaker&#39;s
so father I have her they&#39;re talking
about communication they&#39;re talking
about Student Center approaches they&#39;re
talking about having a lot of pressures
a lot of visuals connecting with the
students and that is good that is what
we really want to do in our teaching
situations so according to qu means
theory he says the first quadrant
quadrant a is very important because we
can make the delivery out of our
teaching
can make content comprehensible and that
is very important and as we go down to B
C and D the tasks in our teaching
situation become more complex now let me
point out to quadrant D so here you have
context context reduce and cognitively
demanding tasks and this is what coming
coming soon Cummings calls
cognitive academic language proficiency
so here we can see things such as
standardized tests taking a test using
math concepts and and calculations
listening to a lecture so as you have
seen sometimes in universities we have
the teacher he comes in front to the
podium and starts lecturing the students
and the students are supposed to listen
take notes etc so that is very
cognitively demanding because the only
visuals that the students have is the
the speaker right so anyway so this is
my metaphor taken from teaching to this
notion of assessment so as you can see
here when we design this assessment this
assessment is was the sign in order to
assess cognitive academic language
proficiency this was an assessment
designed for English language arts
classes now a little bit of information
here so these classes in the u.s.
obviously in the u.s. we have what we
call mainstream students meaning native
speakers of English but also we have
immigrant students or well or you know
what we call ESL students so we have
students from several countries from
Asia from Europe run Ukraine from Mexico
etc so here the idea is that we designed
this assessment of course in English
with the understanding that we&#39;re going
to have some students who are ESL
students who&#39;s maybe
English language proficiency is not
going to be right at the same level as a
native speaker of English so my metaphor
is this the idea is to use this academic
language that strives for high levels of
cognition but instead of just coming and
applying to applying it to students who
are going to stuff all the delivery of
the assessment we&#39;re going to make the
delivery of the assessment
comprehensible okay and that&#39;s the
beauty of formative assessment so here
you can see I have academic language is
moving towards the other quadrant
because we are going to provide the
context needed for the students to
understand how we&#39;re implementing the
assessment so let me talk to you about
this Clell component that we have in the
in this assessment so you can see a
funnel here so basically there&#39;s three
circles there one says UDR okay
ud are for those who are familiar in
language assessment means what it stands
for univille Universal Design Review
what that means is that test developers
or even us as teachers when we&#39;re
designing an assessment we must make
sure that our passages our test
questions our items etc have to be
design in a general way in an
approachable way that can be understood
by different student populations so for
instance talking about ll students
talking about students with special
needs etc so that this is a component
that is very important in in assessment
al basically means academic language so
we&#39;re making sure that our test is
accurate that it measures high standards
and in the in the middle you see
national standards in the US of you a
few years ago it was implemented what is
called the Common Core State Standards
so now every state in the US has to
has to be bound to these standards so
teachers no matter if you are teaching
science social studies language arts ESL
etc have to teach towards these
standards so what this is the metaphor
or this is the point of this assessment
if we take the elements of making the
content comprehensible for Els in our
classroom and we take I guess the
elements of good of a standards good
assessment and if we make our assessment
comprehensible if we made the delivery
of this assessment comprehensible then
we&#39;re going to have an English language
arts formative assessment addressing the
needs of both English language arts
students meaning native speakers and
English language learners so that&#39;s the
the main idea of our assessment okay so
now let me talk to you about this notion
of linguistic I ll misconceptions I am
sure you are familiar with this notion
of inter language so inter language is
this concept crafted by all of these
linguists but basically it means that
when we are learning a second language
in that process we sometimes tend to
borrow elements from the first language
and we use it in the second language
sometimes there&#39;s something called
negative transfer what that means is
that I may I may use certain grammatical
elements from my first language or
vocabulary or even pragmatics I can use
my de prague marries from the first
language use it in the second language
in the second context and that leads to
pragma linguistic failure meaning that
if I if I am communique am learning
Ukrainian and if I try to talk to you
and if I transfer elements from my first
language to Iranian you may understand
me but you&#39;re going to notice my in my
mistakes right and you&#39;re gonna say well
you know he&#39;s learning or whatever and
that&#39;s that&#39;s fine so this is the
process of inter language
okay so let me talk now about the
rubrics so our rubrics have three
columns okay and this is the idea the
idea is to have the students perform an
activity so they&#39;re going to be
assessing and in a in a very specific
activity according to a specific
standard or objective and the teacher is
going to is going to start delivering
the activity so actually our tasks look
like a lesson plan it&#39;s almost like a
lesson plan but students don&#39;t know that
we&#39;re we&#39;re assessing them okay but
anyway in the rubric in the first column
we have what we call in we stick inter
language misconceptions so these are
descriptions that the teacher when when
he or she is going to assess the student
he or she needs to be aware about what
could be the linguistic misconceptions
that that particular student could do
when being assessed this also has to be
with aspis aspects of grammar vocabulary
discourse features etc another one is
cultural misconceptions obviously if I
am let&#39;s say if I am a student for a new
crane I moved to the US and I star
learning English I start learning the
concepts there there&#39;s going to be a
discrepancy in the culture so there&#39;s
going to be a lot of contextual things
in the instruction in the assessment
that I am NOT going to understand so I
need help with that and the other one is
I have to do with misconceptions related
to instructional background let me give
you an example i was born in mexico and
then i moved to the US when i moved to
the US and I became a teacher I was told
you need to teach the writing process
and I didn&#39;t know what the writing
process was so in the u.s. it is a very
systematic approach to writing any any
type of writing or essay so as you know
we start by brainstorming ideas we start
by making that our
we start by writing a draft then we edit
the draft we do some peer review then we
produce another draft and then we get a
final copy and then we have our essay
okay so that concept that is an that is
an instructional concept that I was
never taught in Mexico for instance and
in many Latin American countries they
don&#39;t teach the writing process so this
is something that is very important to
be aware if we&#39;re assessing our students
they may not be familiar with the
instructional background or
instructional concept that you are
trying to do with them right so this is
column number two so in column number
two basically what we have are these
questions in order to elicit els
thinking around language challenges of
the task so the idea here is if the
student is not responding as we want the
idea here is not to penalize the student
as Todd said don&#39;t penalize the student
the idea is to elicit questions that are
going to help the student understand
what we&#39;re trying to assess what we&#39;re
trying to measure so and these questions
of course should be tapping of higher
order critical thinking skills so that
is my column number two so let me talk
to you about column number three so in
column number three basically our
suggestions for different differentiated
instruction so or or English language
support so here the idea is that based
on the assessment procedure that we just
implemented teachers can make
annotations about what are the next
steps in terms of instruction what our
son maybe accommodations what are some
instructional things that we can do in
order to help that student in the in the
future so in other words this is the
formative goal so another thing could be
instructional ideas that may help
Els achieve and understanding the task
or basic concepts sometimes we may
realize okay I am us
the student impressed in present
progressive for instance but then I
realize in that the student housing
master present progressive so then my
next steps would be to encourage the
teaching of present progressive so that
that&#39;s the whole point of formative
assessment now I want to show you if you
can click on the first one group
presentations please let me give you
some background about the task so the
task is basically the students the
students have read a poem okay and they
have they they Mason annotations and
they were supposed to do a presentation
about the poem and the idea is that
everybody would present and the rest of
the students are supposed to take notes
write down comments for for those who
are presenting etc so here you can see
this looks like like a lesson plan and
of course not gonna read it or anything
but here the idea is that the students
are going to do some presentations about
a poem and then the rest is going to
take notes so I wonder if you could
scroll all the way to the to the rubric
so this is our rubric okay so notice
that in the first column we have the we
have implemented a mr. Yellen is
conceptions so in this case it is
important to tell the teachers who are
assessing the students that Els may not
be a word about they come about the
speaking conventions in the US for
instance so they may not know the basic
principles of content presentations
delivery how to use hang movements
gestures our body how to use intonation
etc so here the point is that the
teacher must be aware that perhaps some
students may not be familiar with this
so that&#39;s something to take into
consideration so as this - as the
teacher is assessing the student then
the teacher can ask follow-up questions
so for instance okay so I am the teacher
maybe I have a student and I could be
asked in the the student okay you did
your presentation what do you think
when good what what do you think went
wrong how do you think you can improve
the delivery of your presentations what
can you do in terms of gestures volume
and intonation visual aids etc so these
are questions that were the teacher can
be asking the student in order to to
help him or help her okay and on the
third column we have basically
instructional advices for the future so
for instance students need to be active
active listeners so that means that they
need to be quietly they need to be
sitting down they need to take notes
they need to to make sure they they take
notes on the most important parts of the
presentation also as you know in the
u.s. the the teacher respects responses
from the from the students so it is
important that each of our students
participate raise their hands etc so if
I am if I am NOT an active if I am a
passive listener maybe we need to teach
the student to be an activist speaker so
to ask questions to be participative etc
could we scroll a little bit to the next
page please if you want to copy this
does email me I&#39;m happy to share it with
you but look at this our rubric one has
all of the misconceptions for instance
just just to give you more examples
students may not know how to be
participative in a group conversation
when somebody is speaking as we know in
the u.s. there is this notion that when
we are listening to a presentation or
when we are in a conversation we have to
we have to know how to take the floor we
raise our hand we wait until somebody
stops speaking then we interrupt so some
of these things students may not be
aware of let me give you another example
in different cultures for instance in
Hispanic culture in some African
American cultures in the u.s. people are
what we call
polychronic what that means is that we
could have maybe four people talking and
I am talking to somebody here and these
two people are talking at the same time
and is perfectly fine because everybody
understands each other that and that&#39;s
culture okay
but in other settings for instance in
the u.s. is not is not correct so we
need to wait our turn and then continue
speaking also another thing so I want
you to take a look at this the third
column we can use this opportunity to to
talk about language so we can teach you
students for instance how to get at to
get additional information what types of
questions do they need to us to give
encouragement and showing empathy etc
I&#39;m going to close here because of the
timing but feel free to email me if you
want a a copy of this of this test and
I&#39;ll be happy to share it with you and
and again so don&#39;t be afraid about
getting yourselves involved in
assessment assessment is a very
interesting field and we needed for our
students thank you very much
[Applause]
