well let me be clear I did not overcome
any terrible health problem I did not
start a non-profit I&#39;m not saving the
world at all I&#39;m terribly terribly
ordinary but I have a curse word in my
title and I have pictures so we should
have fun let me tell you a little bit
about give you a little background about
my my family so I&#39;m the youngest of C
and I told you don&#39;t tell the boss I&#39;m
the youngest of seven kids from the
fabulous 70s very similar the Brady
Bunch except more children my parents
have lived with my husband and I for 15
years we&#39;ve been married for 25 so 15 of
our 25 years so he has immediately
opened the gates of heaven for himself
and he could do no wrong on this earth
for the rest of his life good deal I
have a really bad habit of taking in
stray animals particularly dogs and one
elusive cat does not like to be filmed I
have four fabulous crazy wild fun
children and I have a hundred crazy and
wild fun people who I work for me
in advertising and this is kind of what
a day looks like
[Applause]
I didn&#39;t need to get many volunteers for
that they were all signing up for that
they were actually fighting for the
bucket so every Sunday night and or
monday morning depending on how much I
have my act together I send out did it
the done the family text where everybody
has to go to the 15 places and there&#39;s
only three drivers but we have a nanny
and it always changes and Bernadette
needs to go to you oh because she&#39;s got
lacrosse but then she&#39;s gotta take her
brother to debate and then we got to
pick up Tim at st. Mark&#39;s because he has
to go over to you our Ursuline for
because he&#39;s in the pipe but then he has
to get back to water polo because then
my brother has to pick up my his other
brother and then they got to drive back
to lacrosse because Bernadette has the
car and then it all changes in about two
hours because somebody forgot their
swimsuit or somebody had a concussion
but I will say it&#39;s highly entertaining
and if you want to be added to the
family eat text I would be happy to get
your ear cell phone because it brings
great joy into most people&#39;s lives when
I read it to them so everybody asked me
every day of my life I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
happened and since the last 20 years I
get this question every single day how
do you do how do you do it and I usually
come up with something ridiculously
grossly trite like one day at a time not
well at all
but the truth is I don&#39;t think about it
this is my reality it&#39;s my happy place I
thought I mean I have an amazing job I
love my job I love my company I have the
most incredible husband on the planet
and if anyone has met him they will
vouch me that he really is truly is the
one and only I&#39;ll make sure he here here
is that I have four absolutely fantastic
kids and I have two parents that are
elderly but relatively healthy that live
with me
I consider myself ridiculously lucky but
there&#39;s a totally different way of
looking at that you can look at it and
say it&#39;s ridiculous it&#39;s stupid it&#39;s
it&#39;s exhausting I fail at at least one
thing at any given time in my life on a
daily basis I don&#39;t I don&#39;t my life is
not filled with sturdy bridges my life
is a row
Brij and I fall down all the time this
is the one thing that women are really
great at is striving for perfection why
do we do that to ourselves I mean doing
more we don&#39;t would this little that
there is no such thing as perfection but
we strive for it always strive for it
and then what&#39;s our most that our
strongest Achilles heel
striving everyone together striving for
perfection and it&#39;s so ridiculous of
what we do to do to ourselves and how we
beat ourselves up
I was recently in New York and at an
award ceremony for women in marketing
and advertising and just an incredible
group of women and really influential
and doing amazing things and I was
walking up on stage and there was
another woman walking up behind me and
she was about 30 years old and she was
on her second startup and she leans up
to me and she says he&#39;s women these
women around here I don&#39;t belong here
and I turn around I said you&#39;re 30 years
old and you&#39;re on your second startup
you are a badass and then I walked off
the stage and there was another young
woman and she&#39;s lamenting her weight and
she says this is my second baby the
baby&#39;s two years old and I cannot lose
this weight and I&#39;m just exhausted and
I&#39;m just a hot mess and I said look
around the room take a look around the
room and we could take a look around
this room and look at all the incredible
women and I&#39;m talking incredible these
women are winning awards they&#39;re doing
amazing things in the workplace in in
the social space and communities and I
said and I guarantee you every single
one of them looked in the mirror today
and said I am such a hot mess
and you know what we are we are hot mess
because you know the board meeting is
gonna Trump the baseball game sometimes
and the debate tournament is gonna force
you to cancel client meeting
it just happens it&#39;s just reality why do
we strive so hard for this perfect
balance it&#39;s not real
life is not balanced its ebb and flow
and why don&#39;t we just get in the groove
and enjoy the ride it&#39;s it&#39;s really
amazing to me how hard we are on
ourselves and it&#39;s by the definitions we
create we create and society creates
these ideas of what is important to our
children we we feel like huge failures
because we miss the sports and sports
awards ceremony or we miss the field
trip or miss moms and muffins and
whoever came up with moms and muffins
needs to be arrested I mean seriously
what evil person did that just another
thing I&#39;m gonna miss if you find her let
me know and dad&#39;s with donuts too that&#39;s
another one totally wrong but those are
things that we defined ourselves and the
society defines is that what our kids
remember do our kids really consorted
concerned about the fact that mom missed
one of my plays one night and I thought
about my own kids and my kids loved
telling stories and they&#39;re great
storytellers and they love to listen to
stories and I have this journal I keep
at my bedside I&#39;ve had since they were
babies and I wrote down every funny
thing they ever said when their babies
and toddlers and today they&#39;re teenagers
and they&#39;re still saying really really
funny things and they love when I read
from that book and so we&#39;re constantly
talking about childhood stories and one
night we were probably out two years ago
we were sitting on the bottom bunk of my
son&#39;s bed all four kids piled on and I
was sitting on the end of the bed and
telling stories and Pete was 14 at the
time and he told me a story that I&#39;d
never heard and I need to preface this
story because there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s
a prop involved you might see this it&#39;s
a noisy thing that everybody in fact is
like why is she wearing that bracelet
right by the mic it&#39;s driving me crazy
well this is a very important this is a
very important piece of jewelry for me
this never goes off my wrist it&#39;s very
noisy it&#39;s very obnoxious people call my
dog tags it has four metals on it and
they&#39;re saint metals and they&#39;re all my
children so wherever I go my children
are with me and it&#39;s very very
sentimental to me my husband is
wonderful with jewelry he&#39;s very
generous but nothing can trump this
bracelet so he&#39;s telling me this story
and he says I remember when I was in
kindergarten and I was in mrs. McCarty&#39;s
class and they used to have special
readers don&#39;t you hate that special

videos at 10:00 a.m. like who can make
that special readers and he says and I
know you
I knew you could never do it because
you&#39;re either working or traveling and
one day mrs. McCarty said oh we have a
very very special surprise today we have
a very very special reader and we can&#39;t
wait for you see the special readers and
he&#39;s curious and he says and then I hear
this and he says and I close my eyes and
i clenched my eyes shut and I squeezed
them I said it&#39;s gotta be Tyler&#39;s mom
she has a brace that there&#39;s no way can
be mom and I secretly pray and I
secretly praise you and I open my eyes
and there you were and I thought how did
he remember that he was five years old
of course I cried like a baby I&#39;m trying
to keep it together up here but then I
thought well I had forgotten that all
those years ago I was in Los Angeles on
a business trip and I was there for
several days and my morning meaning was
canceled and I was just aching for my
kids and I said you know what I&#39;m gonna
get on the red-eye I&#39;m gonna change my
flight
I called his teacher I said I&#39;m going
straight from the airport to reading
time just go with me I&#39;m gonna text when
you get there and just we&#39;re gonna have
to play with the timing she said
absolutely so I did that I did it from
me I did it
that wasn&#39;t a plan scripted moment out
of a play in a sports banquet that was
just something I needed it I needed to
be with him and I needed to be with my
kids and it frankly kind of selfish
because I was just missing him and that
was his treasured moment that he that he
remembered and it made me think what do
you remember about childhood what are
your best memories I&#39;ll tell you a
couple of mine my mom was pretty strict
she had seven
I had a run-in type you saw the Brady
Bunch house / - yeah
she had seven kids and eight and a half
years by the way she makes me look very
inefficient so she was in the kitchen
and she&#39;s kind of singing a goofy song
and she&#39;s kind of goofing around which
is not like my mom all of us are
standing around and one by one one of us
starts to sing with mom and then another
one piles in and before you know it all
seven of us they&#39;re singing and we&#39;re
dancing and we&#39;re roaring laughing and
it made my heart swell and I just
thought this is so awesome
I don&#39;t remember if she went to my play
I don&#39;t remember a field trip I remember
my mom being goofy in the kitchen and
she never did I never I remember doing
the dishes with one of my brothers and
we had a good there were seven of us so
we got teams you know we could all break
up in camps so it was our our dish duty
and by the way I highly recommend having
a lot of kids because they do do the
dishes when they get older so a little
tip my mother taught me so my brother
and I are in the kitchen and we&#39;re and
we&#39;re fighting over who&#39;s gonna wash and
who&#39;s gonna dry because frankly neither
one we neither of us want to do either
so we decided to dump all kinds of soap
into the sink and start a huge bubble
fight and made a huge mess over the
kitchen and my mother comes storming
into the kitchen and I&#39;m thinking we&#39;re
dead we are dead storms in the kitchen
sees this huge mess just starts down -
laughs and there&#39;s scoops up to big
things of bowls and throws it right in
our face and I thought that&#39;s awesome
that&#39;s a moment that I will never ever
forget and that&#39;s an unscripted moment
that&#39;s an unplanned moment and those are
the moments those are the moments that
build that crazy beautiful messy rope
bridge that we walk every day in life so
don&#39;t worry about those planned moments
don&#39;t worry about moms and muffins or
the field trip that you miss or the
teachers meeting that you&#39;re three hours
late for just cherish the moments
because at the end of the day that&#39;s all
that anyone remembers
you
