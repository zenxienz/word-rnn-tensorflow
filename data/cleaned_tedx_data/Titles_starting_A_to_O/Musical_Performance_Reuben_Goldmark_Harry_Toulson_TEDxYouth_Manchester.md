hi my name is Ruben and this is Harry
hello there
we&#39;re from Cheatham School of Music in
Manchester which as he heard is the
largest specialist school in the UK we
have 300 students aged from 8 to 18 and
we&#39;re all musicians and Harry and I from
the jazz department yeah so essentially
what we do it&#39;s jazz improvisation so
it&#39;s making stuff up on the spot like
with classical music you kind of play
what you&#39;re told to do and express it
your own way well this we just kind of
come up with it on the spot
so it&#39;s great fun so we&#39;ll talk about
that and we&#39;re going to first play a
piece that I wrote called
little Rosebery which is named after a
mountain and our feast near where I live
you
[Music]
okay so essentially what we did we
played the tune that I wrote and then
just improvised upon the chord sequence
which exists on that and what I was what
we wanted to talk about really is how
jazz links with conversation because we
were like classical music your toldot to
say like you&#39;re given a script in a way
and then you express it in your own way
which is like reading from a book but
with commas like it with jazz it&#39;s like
conversation so someone says something
to you and you respond to it like in the
same with jazz women could play an idea
yeah and I respond with something
corresponding to that maybe low which I
don&#39;t know it might work on it depends
on the situation anyway so and a lot of
people say were just like I can&#39;t really
do it I don&#39;t know what to do but who
taught you to speak I mean you learn it
as you go along when you speak into
someone you&#39;re not told I say this in
this situation you try things out you
say something awkward and you never do
it again you know that does not work and
then so and then you wouldn&#39;t do that
game the same with jazz so take a nice
yeah to make this called misty
it&#39;s lovely and slow and I could just
play something that would not work at
all well hope it doesn&#39;t anyway I&#39;ll try
[Music]
it&#39;s a bit ways so you&#39;re awkward and so
all you could do something which fits in
the situation so let&#39;s try it out see I
hope it works
[Music]
yeah so are we musicians I mean we could
be painters or poets or artists whoever
because music is such a universal
language it&#39;s amazing I could walk into
a bar in Tokyo and there would be
Japanese jazz musicians and I don&#39;t
speak any Japanese at all and they they
might not speak in English but we could
play jazz and not talk at all and we
could sort of discuss things like
musically and artistically which we
wouldn&#39;t be able to do with words and
with music you can describe incredibly
abstract things like emotion and thought
and you can be very subtle with how you
want to phrase things yeah so we&#39;re
going to take you through hikes we&#39;re
going to play a tune which you&#39;ll all
know eventually we were going to like
take through the foundations of music so
there&#39;s there&#39;s a card sequence which
exists
I don&#39;t know whether any of you&#39;ll get
it off the spot so in essentially that&#39;s
what you improvise over
and he could modulate to some if you&#39;re
going to change it you could not
modulate over that so change key
it&#39;s no difficulty I go back okay yeah
but then if you had a bit of rhythm to
that so like a B you get it now
ed Sheeran shake for you right and then
so what we&#39;ll do we&#39;ll just I&#39;ll play
the tune and then yeah you get the time
we&#39;ll play the tune and then we&#39;ll just
see where we go on there it might go a
bit weird
[Music]
yeah
[Applause]
