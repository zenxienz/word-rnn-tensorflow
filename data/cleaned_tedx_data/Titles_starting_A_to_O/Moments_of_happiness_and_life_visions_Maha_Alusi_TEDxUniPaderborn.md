it&#39;s something we should not wait for
happiness was something we could create
but how do we create happiness do we
know its ingredients wait I was 15 years
old when the peaceful prosperous life I
was living was threatened with war and
death I lived in their 60s when I
started there in Baghdad in Iraq my
parents and the people around them were
so the individuals were empowered to
build they were building schools
hospitals art philosophical debates were
coming around this is how I lived
empowered people who are doing they had
help then I remember them singing John
Lennon&#39;s song imagine it was not a dream
what they were living they were inviting
people from the outside internationalism
and they were talking about world peace
four years later I was in London
studying architecture my parents have
decided that we&#39;re gonna study then
anything until the war is over the war
was never over and I witnessed exactly
those people powerful and ours I would
miss them waiting they were waiting for
the news to tell them something
my father watched the television day and
night listened to the radio
my life in London was the continuity of
the life I lived in
that where I was living in an
international peaceful hopeful
environment and I wanted so much to
share that with my father but I couldn&#39;t
I watched sadly how my father was not
the the powerful person but somebody who
was waiting years later I arrived to
Berlin and I started my life in Berlin
and I am somebody from childhood who was
fascinated with time I like to visualize
time time for me is my passion which I
later on made of my professional
I&#39;ve made this created this object we&#39;re
using the flame as this eternal symbol
for time to start it it has burst and
then it&#39;s branches into many and then it
goes down to two and then one and it
finishes
I was so keen and telling this to
everybody else to watch organic I&#39;ll
create a business out of this there was
nothing for this business then available
because nobody knew the product nobody
there was no technology of multi-lane no
production established so I had to do
everything and good as it was I was
doing it I was achieving it it was
rewarding
it was incredibly happy to see that I
was able to but it was a big task and
that I was over alone so then no matter
how happy I was there was something
wrong I was unhappy because the people
around me my children my family they
didn&#39;t have any much of my time I
couldn&#39;t get it so I looked at the
situation and I thought I
to do something and that&#39;s what I did I
use the same capacity where I envisioned
my business I looked at my life my life
I&#39;ve got a beginning and it has an end
and why would it side would live the
ideal life wouldn&#39;t I want to have happy
moments until the very end well that&#39;s
what I said and I started doing that and
at the beginning when I was doing this I
was truly controlling my feelings but
when I faced a moment of anger instead
of going in I would just go hmm
or if I faced a moment of fear instead
of good I would just go hmm I started
literally changing first of all my
impression towards the moment I started
seeing it in another vision then I was
asked to give a TEDx talk in 2010 in
Berlin about this happy moment and
people afterwards kept on asking me but
hey there are unhappy moments in life
you are you are you telling you are
fooling yourself here then I was being
aware I started becoming aware of what I
was doing in fact little by little it
didn&#39;t come from one day to the other I
started practicing a methodology and the
method is and I&#39;ll share it with you
today you see you know when you go
through a very hard moment and it takes
time for this moment the pain and and
then the change and you know that at
some point in the future this time
stretch you get out of it and you&#39;re
happy again
now most then often this
would have caused a happier moment it
would&#39;ve caused something in your future
but we could only see that backwards Oh
what I did with my methodology is that I
squeezed this time and I reduced it to
that moment and here we are
I&#39;ll give you the method the method has
got three keys time creators thinking
which is not really much don&#39;t tell me
I&#39;m not creative and you&#39;ll see that
examples in life would feed your
creativity and storytelling one very
very vital factor in order for this
methodology to work you will need the
humans sharing in the moment because you
will see now how I tell you and an
example you will need to use your
storytelling to tell those people about
the moment so when I do this I first a
moment that is difficult with me and I
immediately within that moment forced
myself instead of falling for I reduced
this bad luck
I&#39;ll reduce the superficial ah okay bad
moment I forced myself into creating a
vision that encompasses the mist moment
within a bigger picture of time time is
my profession so then I make sure that
those people who are scared
exhausted whatever they are share it
with them and then it is more often than
it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not the future
prediction that I did but sometimes it
hits and it looks like I might advise a
govern which is like a future teller and
and we would have our fun so not only
does the moment pass by but we are
having fun
your story so the example is I chose
free for my company see when I was when
the company was expanding I plan for our
larger production and lot of production
meant getting lots of money from the
bank borrowing it organizing it we were
a team of six people and we were going
ahead and doing the steps to leading to
this production but one of them with
team members made a mistake and it
costed a lot of money so here we are on
my team members completely shocked and
looking at me to my reaction I was like
inside here it was like mmm I don&#39;t know
where to get the money from but I said
to them hello look at it this way this
is not a mistake I thank you that is a
price we paid for a point in the future
it&#39;s not gonna be far ladies and
gentlemen we&#39;re gonna be big we&#39;re gonna
be international we did the commentator
on international that was one of my
future predictions but anyway I was
waiting for that and and then if we
would have made this which you&#39;re
calling a mistake not reminded us there
it with a bit of disaster for us the
money worked to find I managed the money
my team was calm we managed a production
that was a big number for us and only
they won they year later I was a
negotiation thing for to get more
financing with investors and guess what
was our biggest plus they evaluated the
team because it was the team that was
something for the investors I didn&#39;t
know that I mean I was still new to the
previews of business making so I added
the value to my company because my team
knew if they do any mistakes then they
knew that we will work it out together
there is a way another value by added
which I did not know which was actually
the SMI of my at the beginning can i
balance and to my family and my business
I didn&#39;t times they were autonomous I
could depend on the people I am working
with and they could make their decisions
and I could deal with my family so I
mean from this example to the fact that
the more I practice this methodology the
more I realized something there was
something I did not calculate with I
started with happy moments but I ended
up gaining an insight into human
connections the more people I connected
to the more good relationship with them
my human universe I started calling it
the universe started expanding so the
older I got the more the time passes by
you know you know I loved visualizing
time I started seeing the universe that
was expanding that is made out of humans
and then one day I was reading watching
a TEDx talk combine a robot valanor he
is from Harvard University and
researcher they did
75 years years ago it is a very rare
study because it is hard for such study
to continue over a lifespan so they
visualized time in a scientific way they
studied 720 for many from teenagers till
that an old age and they connected all
of the information about their lives at
the beginning those men who are seeking
fame they were seeking richness and a
hard work but the ones the data says
that those who
beings who managed to figure out to be
connected to their society to be
connected to their family to have good
relationships are the ones who were
happier and healthier all of this year&#39;s
years of data from Harvard University
was shrunken to one sentence good
relationships make us healthier and
happier and I was going yeah that&#39;s what
I found out myself so active meanwhile
my priorities because of that were
changing because I did not measure my
time with how much Fame I get or what I
gain of it financially I changed the way
I deal with decision making
so it was connecting to humans and we
had two years ago there&#39;s this crisis
where people seeking refuge coming and
there are so many people who were
helpless powerless bad they brought me
to this time when I saw my father in not
having the power the energy to do
anything and I thought to myself I&#39;ll go
there
I&#39;ll help and that&#39;s what I did the
first time I must admit the first couple
of months I was exhausted I was drained
the people around me to helpers they
were equally exhausted and help because
the concept was wrong then I reminded
myself no it&#39;s not about helping it is
about empowering so that&#39;s what I did I
started a program I&#39;ve been running this
program since February 2016
I bring locals and the refugees together
with the aid of music and songs popular
songs we exchange stories I brought them
in my 13 year we called it the time
Academy once every week only
three hours I bring people that together
and it was very entertaining for people
and I put them under my condition and
the condition we had my methodology
which said here we are not talking about
pain we are talking about the future and
I&#39;ll tell you if each one of you knew
the value of how beautiful it is for us
to be here together Hey it was war what
brought you but we are now together we
could make something out of it
so those locals and the newcomers they
became they had an exchange the music
helped us and then something incredible
happened well I added a little bit of
touch of my creative and visionary let&#39;s
call it storytelling I said if we just
were here with pleasure then we could
change the future for our generations
and that piece will come all over the
world because all humans need for peace
is that they they are in the moment
connected to each other happy without
hate so that worked and it was a joke
between us and many people really
managed from the locals I must say they
were happily continuing with this
communication the refugees they started
learning the languages and they work
empowered I have many stories that that
happened we became a community of more
than 350 and many internationals we
became as something a word-of-mouth
people were selling about us and it was
spreading
we got people visiting us from outside
learning another detail of this Harvard
study which was announced extra bonus
which said those people with good
relationships perceived pain in another
way they were no matter how big pain was
they did not use their happiness and I
have another proof just two weeks ago I
was in the s-1 I mean here&#39;s the
embarrassing to tell how the accident
I&#39;ll tell you because it will help you
and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here I was in the
shade of the shelter of the s-bahn
walking see that the train is coming
exist six minutes to send is shining
after so many days of rain so I walked
towards the Sun the Sun shone in my eyes
I close them we continue to continue
walking and I fell in the track of the s
part so here I was the train I knew it
was another six minute I lived at my leg
and it was only my foot was connected to
my neighborhood my brown skin so I put
it back together and I called for help
I&#39;m villain he picked me up the lovely
people told me out of the truck and then
I was in the hospital for ten days it
was incredibly painful but guess what
what I did all throughout the time I
just was just it became for me a nature
I connected to human beings and just to
all of you by the way I can enjoy your
spines your lovely identities reason it
was like that it was every second the
young people who lifted me up from the
tract the lovely woman who received me I
learned that she&#39;s a Harkins rooster is
just a nurse and the man who took me in
the ambulance
he&#39;s 31 years old who just found the
partner of his life and he now wants to
make kids and the surgeon the nurses I
can&#39;t stop telling you how beautiful it
was when I was leaving the hospital they
were saying to me
it&#39;s beautiful having your own they said
yeah that was a lovely experience I will
finish up because my sign is that Alton
the conclusion is if we have good
connections good relationships then we
are going to be happy
healthy nothing will measure it to us
only our capacity to view our life in
image if you have that connection then
you lose out on one your ingredients of
the close relationship but ideally this
is mama and papa are giving me as you
grow you keep your connections to human
beings you don&#39;t have to be every day
seeing them but just be kind a smile on
your face and don&#39;t upset people don&#39;t
let them upset you because you can and
you know it is your ingredients and if
you reach to this symbol with all of
those names then you are a healthy human
being and you are a happy one
