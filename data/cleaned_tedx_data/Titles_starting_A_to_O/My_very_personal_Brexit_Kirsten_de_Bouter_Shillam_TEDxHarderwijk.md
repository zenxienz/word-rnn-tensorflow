full of nerves and anxiety I was
standing at the meeting point at
Heathrow Airport this was such an
exciting and buzzing place from here
people would fly all over the world I
was in London London I had just turned
20 years old I didn&#39;t really speak any
English I also hadn&#39;t found out just yet
that my Dutch go up and speak to anybody
and make new friends did quite a line
with the English stiff-upper-lip I was
about to embark on a journey for six
months and I learned lots I learned to
drive on the left-hand side of the road
to eat potatoes with the skin on I
enjoyed sweet treats at the English high
tea and I learned to say please and
thank you but my six months turned into
twenty-six years as you can tell I
learned to speak the language I traveled
the length and the breadth of the United
Kingdom I made lots of friends I funded
my own education I set our businesses I
paid my taxes and I made lots of
mistakes but when after 26 years I
wanted to return to the Netherlands
because my mum was very ill it turned
out it wasn&#39;t quite so easy to come back
sometimes life weaves an intricate web
and it&#39;s not quite so easy to
disentangle yourself from it I learned
that I need a permission from a judge to
move my children from the UK to the
Netherlands on the 23rd of June 2016 I
was
in the Brighton family court a quite
typically English tired and gray looking
building where disappointment and misery
lives there was nobody left in the
building we were the only ones there it
was heart-wrenching to sit and wait
whilst the judge deliberated at that
point we were unable to make any
decisions about our future we just sit
there and waiting just a secured ik
security guards occasionally would poke
their head around the door look at their
watches wondering why it was taking so
long our families were trying to phone
us we were just sitting there waiting
and finally finally after an exhausting
day we got the news that we&#39;ve been
hoping for the judge had given us
permission to move back to the
Netherlands on that very same day the
23rd of June 2016 the British people
voted in favor of brexit by small
majority they aimed to create that
greater division between the EU and the
UK they wanted to sharpen those lines of
in and exclusion the judge gave us the
green light to move back to the
Netherlands and brexit sealed our fate
this is the story of my very personal
brexit my family crosses borders where
do we really belong soon after we got
the judge&#39;s decision our life went into
overdrive we just moved up again we were
going to move and we decided that moving
to a new country would be like giving
yourself a clean slate because don&#39;t you
acquire a lot of stuff
over the years we said we would either
sell recycle or give away most of our
possessions and have that clean slate we
used the moving boxes and on the garage
floor we outlined the parameters of the
small van that we&#39;d hired anything that
would fit in the van would come with us
and everything else had to stay behind
so we worked tirelessly until the house
was more and more empty and echoing and
the Skip outside got fuller and fuller
and fuller until the van was packed and
ready to go
now this coincided with the last day of
term of our children&#39;s school this was
notoriously celebrated with a blanket
banquet anybody involved in the school
community would bring a plate of food
and a blanket and would enjoy the start
of summer now we knew that would be our
last time with our friends on that field
the children played and then
ceremoniously handed over their school
uniforms because that was no longer
needed and then it was time to go my
husband and our two little boys went in
the van and I went in the car with our
eldest son and as we drove off and I
look to my rearview mirror and I saw our
friends waving us tearfully goodbye just
for a moment I wondered what are we
doing with all our possessions just in
these two cars but my eldest son grabbed
my arm and he said mum we&#39;re really
doing this and just his excitement about
the whole adventure somehow made things
okay this is the story of my very
personal brexit my family crosses
borders where do we really belong
we arrived in the Netherlands and the
height of summer now this is odd for me
because I saw very familiar things
through unfamiliar eyes bikes everywhere
of course this was the country with more
bikes than inhabitants and little
children playing unsupervised in the
street and Dutch people waving
everywhere because the Dutch are very
good at waving my children would pull me
to one side and say mom he just waved at
you do you know him as you want perhaps
slightly overly conditioned by the
English reserve my children started
their journey to learning Dutch by
initially speaking English with a Dutch
accent just throw a few hooks in there
and you&#39;ll join the rest of them they
sounded hilarious and a bit odd
we&#39;d been so worried about the children
how would they settle in how would they
learn the language by Christmas all
three boys were bilingual the one thing
we did pick them up on an irregular
basis in those early weeks was their use
of the word weird though our children
are like they named things as they see
them so at times they would say well
that&#39;s weird that&#39;s a bit weird and we
said oh not really
just because you see it for the first
time doesn&#39;t mean is weird it&#39;s
different just because you&#39;re unfamiliar
with this particular thing doesn&#39;t mean
it&#39;s weird not weird but different but
things were very very different for us
now I help manage changing companies on
a day to day basis I understand change
but this transition was on a different
scale how do you reintegrate in a
country
that no longer feels like your home how
do you come back after 26 years to a
country in which everything&#39;s changed
and I&#39;ve changed no I see what you&#39;re
thinking you&#39;re thinking well England
the Netherlands same thing you&#39;re
probably also thinking abut you spoke
the language you ride a bike surely you
understand their bread butter chocolate
sprinkles that&#39;s lunch but you see in
England I&#39;d always been the Dutch wife
now I was the one with the English
husband those first couple of weeks I
was a nervous wreck wreck I&#39;ve been so
conditioned by the emphasis on Health
and Safety in England that seeing my
children cycle off and play in the
street was nerve-racking and we were
that family in a Dutch house in a Dutch
Street watching BBC TV and any other
English channels we could get our hands
on then outside was that car with the
steering wheel on the side where God did
not intended as our Dutch friends sold
it I now finally for the first time in
my life possess a Dutch car and I can
tell you that not a week goes by that I
don&#39;t go out of my house walk to one
side of the car and think I&#39;ve done it
again
then I look around me to see if
anybody&#39;s seen it and then I open the
door quickly put my bags in walk around
to the other side this is the story of
my very personal brexit in the meantime
your bureaucratic mill had started
churning you have no idea you need to
get all your legal paperwork stamped by
the Foreign Office
the originals not the copies so you send
them off pay a price for the privilege
and wait for them to come back in the
Netherlands you need to choose schools
now that&#39;s easy in England because they
could allocated by postcode but in the
Netherlands as many good schools to
choose from and then there is the health
insurance in the Netherlands well that&#39;s
a minefield in its own right but you can
only get health insurance when you have
a National Insurance number my children
didn&#39;t have one that takes weeks to come
through and nobody knows what to do in
the mean time this exchange of all sorts
of documents change of driving licence
and then there&#39;s the immunization
program more or less the same I not
exactly so we were bombarded with
letters of appointments of where our
children also be not a day went by that
I didn&#39;t think to myself what must it be
like for people who come to this country
who don&#39;t speak the language what must
it be like if you come to the
Netherlands or any other European
country and you didn&#39;t make that
conscious choice perhaps you were a fear
of your life it must be so so difficult
during our move we traveled between the
UK and the Netherlands an awful lot and
we would go through Calais and I&#39;ve seen
with my own eyes how people will prepare
to risk their life to jump on moving
trucks where was your mind
be if you&#39;re able to throw your child
over the barbed wire none of us know
each other&#39;s personal stories and as
long as the lines of in and exclusion
are guarded with suspicion and judgment
as long as we see things as weird and
not just different it is almost
impossible to integrate anywhere brexit
has come to symbolize for me the
deepening of those lines between in and
exclusion the desire to gray their
greatest space between the EU and the UK
the island and the mainland to somehow
make Great Britain great again where
after all those years of collaboration a
free movement that&#39;s very hard to
reverse maybe the EU is not all things
to all people but it has ensured a long
time of peace and harmony and
collaboration if I had had a vote I
would have voted remain and that I left
and looking back now my life of 26 years
in the UK I have to wonder did I really
belong inclusion/exclusion who decides
isn&#39;t it true that complex issues could
be best resolved through collaboration
rather than isolation isn&#39;t it true that
some of the big global issues that face
us all will be best resolved by the sum
of all our experiences this past year
has been all about my personal brexit my
family
like so many families out there crosses
borders we don&#39;t sit very well on this
side of the line but we also don&#39;t sit
very well over here we live on that
dividing line and from here we have a
unique perspective to see and learn the
best of multiple cultures we can really
miss the English Sunday roast but get
the ingredients and share it and
exchange with our Dutch friends we don&#39;t
have to choose to be here or there
identify with this or that we live on
that dividing line and it&#39;s not weird
it&#39;s hugely I open enriching
entertaining heartwarming teaching us
constantly not to label things my family
crosses borders we live on this dividing
line proudly looking to the future and
building our tomorrow
