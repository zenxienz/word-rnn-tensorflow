as a psychologist working at a college
Counseling Center one day I decided to
start a new group It was as if that
voice from the movie Field of Dreams was
whispering if you build it and so I
plastered these posters all across the
campus I had borrowed it from a meme and
if there&#39;s any way to get Millennials to
a group it&#39;s through an internet meme
here&#39;s what I put up now I&#39;m glad that
you&#39;re laughing with me because a lot of
people were laughing at me including my
colleagues and my co-workers because
they said to me Mike
who&#39;s gonna even show up to this group
and even if they do are they even going
to talk right so it turns out though
that this group was one of the most
popular the most diverse and the most
connected group I had ever run on a
college campus so why was that I was
sort of surprised myself and I think you
know one of the things the reason that
people were surprised about this group
is because we have a misconception in
our culture about introverts we tend to
think of them as loners as painfully shy
or as people who can&#39;t really have a
good time with others right and and this
is the furthest thing from the truth in
fact when we look at the definition of
introversion it really is about people
who take in a lot from their environment
they are sensitive and perceptive and
they completely are tuned to what&#39;s
happening outside of them and they&#39;re
spending a lot of time processing and
absorbing it Stephen Hawking has a
saying he says quiet people have the
loudest minds right so the other thing
about introverts is while they are
taking all this stuff in every once in a
while they need to replenish and
recharge and they do that best by going
into the world of their imagination and
ideas in other words going inside from
the inside out well before I had a word
for this growing up this sensibility was
most understood by my best friend Emily
wise beyond her years
Emily was quiet and sensitive like
myself and she loved to write about all
of the beauty and wonder of the world
alongside its heartbreak and its pain
cool and fiery she said to me once the
best writing can take off the top of
your head so I really shouldn&#39;t have
been surprised when one day she looked
me dead in the eye and read from her
notebook and said I am nobody who are
you are you nobody too dumbfounded I
didn&#39;t understand what she quite meant I
was sort of discombobulated and she
could see it and so slyly she leaned in
with a mischievous grin and she said
then there&#39;s a pair of us instantly I
felt less alone
because I could see that now we were
part of the secret Club the secret Club
of quiet sensitive misfits together
we&#39;ve kept in touch throughout the years
for a long long time Emily and I in fact
we took a selfie last year like it
introduced you to her
so for those of you who don&#39;t know my
best friend she is in fact 19th century
poet Emily Dickinson
[Applause]
fast forward a number of years I&#39;m a PhD
psychologist and as I go through my work
life I notice more and more
psychologists being passed over for
positions or promotions because they too
were introverts they too were nobodies
in fact they were the Omegas rather than
the alphas of our world and this really
pained me really saddened me and so what
did I do well as a good introvert I read
a book and the book that I found and
discovered was won by a woman a woman
named Susan Cain this book was called
quiet and what Susan Cain did was she
talked about the power of introverts and
she reclaimed what it meant to be an
interest and celebrated it in a way that
was like a revelation to me sort of like
coming home again and the cool thing
about what Susan Cain did is she also
answered Emily&#39;s question in a much
different way it was as she was saying I
thought I was a nobody but actually I&#39;m
a somebody to Susan&#39;s work has done
wonders for helping to nurture and
support our future Abraham Lincoln&#39;s our
Meryl Streep&#39;s our Eleanor Roosevelt&#39;s
our Steve Wozniak&#39;s our Michael Jordan&#39;s
our Stephen Colbert&#39;s our Barack Obama&#39;s
all these different lights and talents
who are introverted themself inspired by
her work as a psychologist I brought it
into my work and what I found was that
if we could help introverts take their
place not only could we help so many
people but we also could help everybody
else take their place in fact we had the
one of the keys to solving our mental
health crisis now what is this crisis
you might ask well I don&#39;t know if any
of you familiar with college where I
work but college Counseling Center these
days are inundated and flooded with
coming into their counseling centers
basically we know the center for Bleach
collegiate mental health did a study
recently and over a six-year period they
found that the number of students at
college counseling centers grew at a
rate five times the rate of
institutional enrollment as you could
see the number of attended appointments
grow at more than seven times the rate
it&#39;s all alarming and so we have a
number of students coming in we have a
system that&#39;s overwhelmed by students
who are overwhelmed and what are these
students coming in with well the
majority of students coming in for
psychological counseling are coming in
for anxiety and depression right now
imagine for a moment if we could help 10
20 or even 30 percent of these students
imagine now for a moment if we can do
that without putting any more dollars
without adding any more staff without
medication with just a simple shift in
our mindset and approach well it turns
out that about a third to a half of the
population in America are introverts
that&#39;s about 33 to 50 percent many of
you are here tonight
great and many you know them they&#39;re
your significant others your children
your brothers your co-workers your
colleagues
so imagine what we could do if we can
help those 33 to 50 percent and even
more but the question I had was why
hadn&#39;t we do it been doing it already
what was sort of like the purloined
letter which was right in front of us
because it turns out when you look at
anxiety and depression
we tend to look at those students with
anxiety and depression as if they&#39;re all
the same we have this one-size-fits-all
mentality in our culture that everybody
is extroverted just like everybody seems
to be right-handed once upon a time
right
and then even psychologists those of us
who are trained tend to focus more on
what can be changed rather than what&#39;s
relatively fixed in other words we focus
more on
nurture rather than nature but the most
confusing part when we look at those
many students who have anxiety and
depression is that for introverts the
anxiety and depression is the effect and
not the cause in other words the true
source of their distress and difficulty
is not anxiety or depression and if we
use the standard treatments it&#39;s really
not going to help them very much
so what can we do what did I do the
first thing that we need to do all of us
is to help introverts learn who they are
what their nature is and to help them to
stop shaming and blaming themselves for
who they are
so let me give you an example we all
have one of these cell phone right so
you know as well as I do you if we have
a number of apps or programs running our
battery drains a whole lot faster right
and so if my battery is that 10% or even
5%
I don&#39;t deem the thing worthless and
throw it away I just charge it up well
turns out that introverts tend to
denigrate themselves like this because
you know they&#39;re also remember
processing so much in their minds
they&#39;re so much inside taking in all
this information and so when they drain
very quickly they start to judge
themselves and they start to think well
I&#39;m worthless another analogy might help
us here to think about it like this it&#39;s
a majority of cars in our country are
gas powered so if you happen to have a
car and you&#39;re running out of fuel all
you need to do is just go down the road
probably a mile or two there&#39;ll be
another gas station but what happens if
you&#39;re an electric car if you&#39;re an
electric car it might take you a long
time before you can find a charging
station or you might have to choose to
go home to do it yourself
well introverts are a lot like those
electric cars the culture sometimes
hasn&#39;t caught up with making sure
there&#39;s enough spaces and places to help
them to really replenish does that make
sense
so but the cool thing is what if I told
you as an introvert that you&#39;re really a
Tesla right so you&#39;re a high-performance
car you might be quiet and you&#39;re
eco-friendly but you also can really be
energized and powerful imagine what a
difference this would make in telling
our fellow introverts in the world that
this is how they&#39;re built right now if
we don&#39;t do something like this we don&#39;t
remind introverts of how they drain so
quickly and how they work well then
we&#39;ll see those anxiety and depression
symptoms come up quite big so now that
we know how introverts drain how can we
help them to charge up how can we help
them to replenish and refill the well
there&#39;s a lot of simple things that
introverts can do the things that we all
can do first off as I said introverts
love to steep in in the world of the
imagination so the best thing for
introverts is to go and read just like I
did with my friend Emily remember the
other thing that introverts can do is to
commune with nature and walk in the
woods just like Henry David Thoreau told
us that we need to do that every once in
a while to connect to our solitude and
the greater connection and mystery of
the world also we need to connect to the
cultural wealth and beauty that we have
like maybe strolling in a museum
another thing that an introvert can do
is you know introverts really hate small
talk
they hate cocktail party conversation so
the better thing for them is to connect
with a best friend or a small group with
what my mother used to call little tea
and sympathy because it turns out that
introverts love to swim in the depths
together with other people who can go
there too now in our very busy and
buzzing culture where there&#39;s very
little room for privacy
one of the last havens for an introvert
is the morning shower which I think we
all kind of look forward to don&#39;t we so
these are things that introverts can do
and what I did in my counseling with
students at the college level is I
started to engage
this kind of way of thinking about
introversion rather than looking at
anxiety depression and when I did it was
like Vera&#39;s dramatic results students
who came in thinking they had profound
issues all of a sudden started to see
them melt away
they had scores of depression and
anxiety in the 80s and 90s out of a
hundred all the way up here and usually
they stayed consistent from weeks a week
so they thought it was a stable trait
but once we incorporated some of these
strategies some of these ways of
understanding things all of a sudden it
dropped down to the same levels that
every ordinary stressed college student
had right and the other thing that was
so wonderful about this work is that
students progress through their sessions
faster they would do in three sessions
what ordinarily would take ten or more
sessions it was wonderful it was like a
miracle and what I saw was students who
were happier and healthier they were
more productive and more creative and
more engaged more recharged more alive
now despite all these wonderful benefits
many of my students still thought of
themselves as nobodies still thought of
themselves like outcasts and I wanted
them to see just what I saw which was
quiet thoughtful bright sensitive
powerful individuals who had so much to
contribute to themselves and the world
remember that group that I started in
the beginning of our talk well that&#39;s
when I have this funny little idea to
set this group in motion because I
wanted introverts to see that not only
were they not alone but they were
blessed with this unique sensibility and
that there was more than a pair of them
there were so many of them in fact and
you know the paradox of bringing
introverts together in a group is they
are the most outgoing Bunch you will
ever find
so they were delighted by this they had
a place that they could call home they
had a place that they could recharge
every week and they could do it together
now imagine if we had more groups like
this at our culture imagine if we had
more of this across the country as far
as I know this was one of the first
groups we had dedicated towards
introverts in the country wouldn&#39;t it be
wonderful if we could have more I
imagine maybe even Emily would have come
to the group if she had been around and
it had have been around for her so you
might think that this is only about
introverts right and it&#39;s wonderful that
you can now maybe take this and help
your children your significant other
your brother or your sister or a perfect
stranger who you want to try and
understand better but it turns out
introverts are like the canary in the
coalmine they alert us to something
really essential for those of you who
read the book the little prince the Fox
says one thing very beautiful he says
one can only see rightly with the heart
what is essential is invisible to the
eye now this is what introverts remind
us of I think it turns out that today in
this culture we embarked &#39;add and
diverted by all of our different
technological devices by Facebook by
Twitter by texts by the 24/7 news cycle
you name it
the world is simply too much with us
right and so introverts remind us that
we all could use a break we all could
use a reprieve we all could spend some
time going inward to connect to the
greatest technology that we have which
is our connection to the internal world
if we could all drop into that then we
could all rise to the occasion to meet
ourselves and the world with greater
vitality creativity and connection and
as Robert Frost said that can make all
the difference
thank you so much
[Applause]
