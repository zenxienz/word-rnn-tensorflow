all it takes take a moment and have
everyone stand up get that blood flow
and get a pump into your brain and in
that moment I want you to think about
your life it&#39;s a kind of a big question
but as you reflect on your life I have a
question so I want you to remain
standing if you have ever accomplished a
task or done something difficult huh yes
see you standing good job
see feel proud you know take that deep
breath being like yeah I&#39;ve done it okay
now I want you to remain standing if you
believe that you are capable of
completing another challenging task in
your life so proud go ahead and sit down
because that right there is confidence
right but it&#39;s a specific type of
confidence see often in life we think
that we&#39;re like oh this is just your
self-esteem which is important and it&#39;s
an umbrella term that we use to describe
anything that has to do with our sense
of self ourselves confidence and ourself
anything respect worth and so when you
have a belief though in a task that you
can accomplish it
that is called self-efficacy and that&#39;s
something I want to explore with you
today in order to do that I want to roll
with a particular metaphor that you can
guess it fits with the theme of today
that life is a game and the reason that
I chose this metaphor outside of the
fact that it fits with the theme for
today it&#39;s because a life is in a game
as a task it&#39;s something that you do
something that you engage in and that
you accomplish and you want to know that
when you play a game that you&#39;re going
to be successful and so in this context
saying that okay you&#39;re self-efficacy is
your belief that you can accomplish a
task within the metaphor that life is a
game it is saying okay I believe that I
can play the game and that I can do it
well and so when you play a game you
want all the pieces if you want to go
out onto the football field and have a
rousing game of football whether it&#39;s
American or proper football
you want to have all the pieces right
you need to actually have the football
to play football and it&#39;s the same with
life we want to have all the pieces that
can make life happy and exciting and
help us be successful you want to play
with determination and grit and
willingness and passion and you want
that confidence that confidence that you
can succeed when you step out onto that
field and so when you think about your
self-efficacy and you think about what
you can do it&#39;s amazing how that can
reflect in your life and so what is
self-efficacy right it&#39;s not a new
concept it&#39;s been around for a while but
maybe it&#39;s been on the sidelines off the
bat on the bench of our lives so what I
want to do is to encourage everyone to
get itself up if you see off the bench
you know do some stretches do some yoga
warm it up a little bit get it out into
the field so that you can use it so that
you can play your game of life with
everything that you&#39;ve got the idea of
self-efficacy comes from a psychologist
named Albert bandura and from the 1970s
he&#39;s been looking at how self-efficacy
affects human functioning in other words
he looks at as how you as an individual
play the game and he has found the
self-efficacy affects so much from how
you act and motivate yourself to how you
face your challenges and achieve goals
and it&#39;s all based in the human
experience because everyone here in this
room everyone in this world is unique
you&#39;re different you each have your own
abilities and capabilities you have
different skills different talents and
differ interests and so you&#39;re going to
play your game of life differently than
every single person but no matter how
you play that game you want to know that
you&#39;re going to be successful you want
to have a strong sense of self-efficacy
and what does that look like someone who
has a strong sense of self-efficacy as
you can imagine is someone who&#39;s
confident someone who&#39;s positive they
focus on the things in life that are
successful even when there are failures
there are people that step onto the
field they are committed they&#39;re engaged
in what they are doing they&#39;re out there
saying I&#39;m giving this all that I&#39;ve got
right now there
on the sidelines or distracted watching
someone else they&#39;re living their life
doing what they want to do they are
people who move past the intent to do
something and actually do it instead of
saying oh I will do this like I will
file my taxes or I will figure out how
to do 50 pushups by next year they
actually go out and say nope
I can and I am doing it so how do we
have individuals strengthen our
self-efficacy see Albert bandura he says
that there are four different ways for
influences of our self-efficacy for
exercises in a way if we&#39;re going to
roll with the life as a game metaphor
ways that we can strengthen it way that
we can make it better and bandura says
that there is one in particular that&#39;s
the best it&#39;s most effective exercise
and that&#39;s what I want to share with you
today it&#39;s something that he calls a
mastery experience a mastery experience
is something that you have done the
first question that I have asked I asked
you when you were standing up and
getting all the blood flowing is saying
hey did you do anything in your life
challenging your difficult or even not
have you done anything that is a mastery
experience it&#39;s not just what you learn
at the end is the whole process from A
to B because if you think about when you
play a game you&#39;re going along right
let&#39;s say you&#39;re playing football and
you want to go for a goal and you&#39;re not
100% sure that you could make it but you
have a coach and friends and family on
the sidelines and they&#39;re saying hey you
can do it has you&#39;ve done it and that&#39;s
a mastery experience it&#39;s that whole
process that you can go through whether
that goes up and down sometimes we know
that the game gets a little bit rough
but it&#39;s something that helps us and
that whole mastery experience teaches us
that we can succeed and every time we
have a mastery experience every time you
accomplish a task no matter how rough or
difficult it might have been beforehand
if it has its ups and downs to the
process but it&#39;s ultimately successful
you are strengthening your self-efficacy
and you can learn so much from each of
your mastery experiences for me and one
in particular that has influenced my
life is
the first language I decided to learn
besides obviously English which I&#39;m
still working on but is Latin I took
Latin in high school which you know I
realized that&#39;s not exactly a foreign
language but it&#39;s a foreign language
might be dead but it&#39;s not my native
language so by definition and you know
it was really exciting I took it from my
last four years of high school and in
fact I learned more about English
grammar in the three years of taking
Latin then I did the twelve years of
school so it was very productive three
years but I had a plan people I had a
game plan and that game plan was I was
going to become an Egyptologist and to
do that I needed to learn Arabic because
what is the use of going to a country
and not being able to talk to people so
it&#39;s like okay I&#39;m gonna go I&#39;m gonna
take Arabic so I go off to university
you know bright-eyed excited as a little
freshman in America and go okay here we
go
sign up for Arabic 101 I&#39;m gonna do this
sit down and go to class the very first
day you know you can imagine there&#39;s
that a little bit of nervousness a
little bit of trepidation because I
don&#39;t really know I&#39;ve never been to
college before but you know that&#39;s okay
I believe I can do it I did high school
I can go to university I sit down this
class I&#39;m like okay look at my teammates
you know your classmates around you&#39;re
like we&#39;ve got this people we&#39;ve got
this we can learn it&#39;s going to be fun
it&#39;s going to be exciting and the
teacher comes in you know halt
professional and whatnot as college
professors often are and says okay and
he just speaks Arabic the whole time and
it hit me all right
I&#39;ve got to learn how to talk that&#39;s
awkward because Latin as being a dead
language you don&#39;t have a casual
conversation in Latin with someone on
the street I mean you can if you want
you know so who up someone say hey quit
a geese which I think means how are you
don&#39;t quote me it&#39;s been a while since I
took Latin qualm comm is the only word I
remember and it hit me that how am I
supposed to learn a foreign language and
and talk I mean I you know you go to the
playbook of life and it&#39;s like language
skills reading writing listening
speaking well it&#39;s I should learn how to
talk I mean I speak English but the
concept of speaking in a foreign
language
fight me so I left class that day and I
felt like I had just done a glory
faceplant in life you know that you&#39;re
triumphantly running down the field and
you trip over your shoelace and you&#39;re
dead you&#39;re gone and you&#39;re like I&#39;m
gonna quit you know I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna
be done we&#39;re gonna go home drop the
class and I&#39;ll just figure out a new
life plan Egypt doesn&#39;t need me then and
I know I got home and I had one of those
you know internal rousing debates with
myself you know how they often go
there&#39;s that part of you that&#39;s like oh
I don&#39;t know scared and then your coach
comes in this coach is self-efficacy and
it is wise it&#39;s been around the block a
few times it knows comes in and says
okay excuse me let&#39;s open the playbooks
sure you say that you can&#39;t learn this
language you can&#39;t learn Arabic why this
part of you is just like because we&#39;ll
want to have to learn new alphabet it&#39;s
written the opposite direction of
English I just I don&#39;t know if I can do
it it&#39;s I mean how am I else is supposed
to learn it if my teacher doesn&#39;t speak
English if he&#39;s speaking Arabic how am I
supposed to pick up this language I
don&#39;t know about those pretty valid
points and here comes self-efficacy it
says okay excuse me let&#39;s roll it back
and let&#39;s open the playbook sure you
took Latin and you didn&#39;t learn speaking
skills that&#39;s okay but let&#39;s see what
you did learn you learned vocabulary and
how to learn vocabulary you learned
grammar hey you learn more about grammar
and English as well so that&#39;s something
you learned how to conjugate verbs and
decline now no one does that anymore
that&#39;s important so why can&#39;t you take
that and apply it to learning a new
language to learning Arabic I was like
you know what coach self-efficacy you
are right I can do it so I did go to
class that next day teacher still spoke
Arabic that I still really had no idea
what was going on I did learn the
personal pronouns that day though I was
really proud of myself
teammates we&#39;ve got this even if it&#39;s
one word we learned something and it was
really exciting because I ended up doing
Arabic as half of what I did in my
undergraduate degree which was
unexpected it was challenging I believe
me I was not a natural speaker the
reading and writing part fine but the
speaking part who even did some Advanced
Studies in Cairo and people would look
at me and be like what language are you
speaking I&#39;m trying but that was what
counted but that I believed that I could
do it because I had done it before I can
see some of you thinking going we&#39;ll
marry it makes sense that you can take a
master experience for Latin because
that&#39;s a language and apply it to Arabic
it&#39;s also a language so I mean come on
it&#39;s like playing the variation of the
same game like playing chess and
speeches or something like that
and so you&#39;re right you know sometimes
the game changes but a mastery
experience is so much more than the end
result it&#39;s the process that helped you
get through that mastery experience
right your determination to continue
your grit you&#39;re optimistic realism or
you&#39;re realistic optimism whichever way
you decide to view the world
those are things those are traits that
you develop as you go through a mastery
experience because as you are
accomplishing a task you develop traits
that you might not even notice the
courage to do something to do something
new
hey to step out onto that field and try
a new game to go and say hey I&#39;m gonna
do this tomorrow and I&#39;m gonna do it
today the willingness to be okay with
being awkward because let&#39;s be honest
we&#39;re all a little bit awkward and when
you&#39;re living and doing something new
it&#39;s okay to be awkward you&#39;ve learned
the resilience right to bounce back from
those moments where it gets tough and
not to give up you learn how to be
patient with yourself you learn to be
excited about when you learn new things
to fill that sense of accomplishment
because guess what the game does change
sometimes you&#39;re going along and you
have got this you&#39;re you&#39;re kicking the
ball down the field
and you&#39;re like I&#39;ve got that I&#39;m gonna
make this I know the rules I have
strategies I know the playbook but the
whistle blows someone pulls you off the
fields and all of a sudden you&#39;re
playing competitive cup stacking which
is real by the way I did it in fifth
grade it&#39;s pretty awesome and so you
just but you don&#39;t know the rule so
you&#39;re like huh how am I supposed to
learn to play this game but it&#39;s okay
because it&#39;s the moment where the game
changes it&#39;s the moment where it gets a
little bit challenging that make life
exciting it makes life it makes life so
much more thrilling and fulfilling
because guess what you get to learn
something new and with a strong sense of
self-efficacy it makes it accomplishable
it&#39;s not some undoable new sport it&#39;s
not CrossFit it is doing what you want
to do and believing that you can do it
if you believe you can do CrossFit you
can do it too so you know what nothing
can hold you back if you believe that
you can do it because I didn&#39;t end up
becoming an Egyptologist
with my Arabic skills as my original
plan was my game of life changed and it
introduced me to new passions and to new
things but Arabic it taught me more than
just a language it taught me patience
it taught me diligence and most of all
it taught me the courage to speak up
everything that has led me to more
mastery experiences that have enriched
and fulfilled my life because my friends
the game of life it&#39;s fun and fantastic
it&#39;s exciting and it can be so much more
fulfilling and wonderful when we play
the game with everything that we have
with nothing on the sidelines that when
we go out onto that field that we say
okay I&#39;ve got all these qualities and
I&#39;ve got the confidence that I can do it
that I can succeed because the game does
get tough sometimes those moments can
hurt a little bit when we fall or we
fall out of bounds or someone steals the
ball but it&#39;s those moments where a
strong sense of self-efficacy can help
us get back on our feet it can help us
get the ball back and get back into the
game and recommit and do well because
you have had mass
experiences you have accomplished
something you all stood so that means
that was at least one thing that you
have done in your life and I&#39;m sure that
you have done hundreds of things and you
will continue to have hundreds and
thousands of mastery experiences that
will not only teach you new skills and
talents but as well as help you develop
traits that will help you have so many
more because every time that you succeed
each time you complete a task no matter
if it&#39;s really rough in the process you
are strengthening your self-efficacy so
in your game of life give it everything
that you have because you are capable
thank you
[Applause]
