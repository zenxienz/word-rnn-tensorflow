there&#39;s a skill out there more important
than reading or math by the time a child
is 5 years old
this skill predicts their health wealth
and love well into adulthood this skill
is called emotional regulation emotional
regulation is the ability to not act
impulsively it&#39;s the ability to take on
challenge and gracefully deal with
life&#39;s ups and downs emotional
regulation is learn about what I want to
do is you know think about how kids
learn emotional regulation now you know
kids who struggle they do get support
and it often comes from specialists and
teachers and they&#39;re very very good at
their jobs but these methods they&#39;re
hard to replicate their one-on-one they
take time and they don&#39;t always meet
kids at their level so as a thought
experiment I&#39;d like to go through with
you what it would be like to teach kids
how to ride a bike in the same way we
teach right emotional regulation now so
for this experiment I&#39;m gonna give you a
kid her name is Sally I&#39;m gonna give you
a bike but the game is a little
different here you and Sally are gonna
meet in an office this office is small
so you can&#39;t actually ride the bike
inside this office so instead what
you&#39;re going to do is you&#39;re going to
talk about the bike
you&#39;re gonna read the manual for the
bike you&#39;re gonna talk about what it
might feel like to ride the bike you&#39;re
gonna come up with strategies for riding
the bike but what you are absolutely not
going to do is ride that bike now time
will pass and you&#39;re gonna call Sally&#39;s
parents in at the end of your session
you&#39;re gonna tell them Sally did a
really good job thinking about that bike
and then you&#39;re gonna send them out
you&#39;re gonna put them on Main Street
Main streets pretty busy and you&#39;re
gonna hope she gets home safely this is
exactly what we&#39;re doing for kids and
emotional regulation right now this is
how we&#39;re talking and that&#39;s how we&#39;re
teaching them my team started wondering
you know how could we build a bike for
emotional regulation what would that
bike look like what would its parts be
and what we realized is that video games
could be a very powerful bike for
emotional regulation so games are great
so games give you a space to learn and
explore and play these are all the ways
that kids learn they take in the world
they build meaning for themselves um
it&#39;s up to us what type of learning
happens in the game whether it&#39;s good or
bad and we choose to build these games
so that they are for emotional
regulation they build these important
skills so let&#39;s take a look at what that
game looks like so what you see here is
you see a player he&#39;s playing the game
and the first thing you think he&#39;s just
playing a game but what you might notice
down at the bottom we&#39;re actually
watching his heart rate heart rate is a
proxy for his emotional state and as he
concentrates on that game his heart
rates gonna change and his heart rate
changed what we do is we actually make
the game harder this might seem
counterintuitive at first but it&#39;s but
what it does is it&#39;s a lot like life so
when you&#39;re in the middle of an argument
you don&#39;t get to turn out and turn away
when you&#39;re taking a test you don&#39;t get
this stop and turn away in fact your
emotions if you don&#39;t have control over
them they&#39;re gonna make that interaction
all the much harder so what happens in
this game is as his heart rate goes up
as he concentrates and gets more
involved in that game smoke starts to
fill the screen that fruit is gonna
start he it&#39;s gonna keep falling out it
he&#39;s not gonna get to stop and withdraw
from the game the only options he has
or to figure out how to get out of that
thing and figure it out for himself
so what he&#39;ll do is he&#39;ll start
breathing and start deep breathing
his heart rate he&#39;ll see it go down and
then he&#39;ll be able to continue on and
play the game as normal the great part
about this is that it works and to
illustrate that fact I want to introduce
you to Bruin Bruin is six years old
Bruin lives in Australia when Drouin was
three he was nonverbal and he was
diagnosed with autism he got a lot of
early support from specialists and he
started to connect with his family so
that was good but then Bruin as most
kids do he kept growing and when he was
five and he was time to go to school now
like most kids with autism transitions
and new experiences were really hard for
Bruin he found himself unable to gain
his composure when things weren&#39;t going
his way or something new was happening
and he was spending a lot of time in the
principal&#39;s office his parents didn&#39;t
know what to do and that context they
found us and the work that my team had
been working on and they started playing
our games so let&#39;s quickly step through
what bruins journey was first thing
Bruin did he started playing just like
the bike rather than sit in the room he
was able to start and look and see and
experiences emotions he&#39;s able to see
that there was something there and he
was able there was something changing
because he was seeing something changing
he was able to become much more aware of
what was going on he was aware there was
a there was a lever there were things
changing in his body as he concentrates
because they&#39;ve been able to feel
himself through and see that that
existed because he had that awareness
he was now motivated for mastery he was
able to he was able to see what worked
take it on and try it out in the game
most kids know that deep breathing is a
strategy that helps them navigate
through challenge but in reality
strategies can come from anywhere
so maybe Bruin has ideas maybe he feels
something in his body
maybe maybe as parents have
ideas maybe his teachers have idea the
reality is he now has a playground he
has a place where he can ride that bike
and see where he can balance himself and
where he can&#39;t balance himself because
he&#39;s able to do this he&#39;s now able to
take on more and more challenge so he
now is motivated both in and out of the
game to see how far he can go for Bruin
the changes outside of the game were
remarkable so he started doing a lot
better at school he started doing a lot
better at home he started bringing the
words from the games into his
interactions and he started doing much
much better for me I was amazed through
an interaction we were able to impact a
family an ocean away so Bruin is just
one kid and right now we&#39;ve reached
about 500 more Bruins we&#39;ve also run
clinical trials to try to establish you
know what is working and what&#39;s not
working as we build these tools and
three results have really stood out to
me so the first is a decrease in
disruptive behaviors so kids who play
these games they are less impulsive and
they&#39;re able to navigate themselves out
of trouble more often second is an
increase in emotional regulation so
these kids have more awareness of
themselves and more strategy when things
are different and new to pull themselves
back to get back in and finally is a
decrease in parent stress it&#39;s very
important for me that these kids don&#39;t
just build skills inside of video games
these kids have to and they are they&#39;re
taking these skills into their home and
into their school and they&#39;re making
real progress it&#39;s not lost on me that
the world is an increasingly angry place
our leaders now they&#39;re interacting and
talking with each other through anger
now more than ever we need to make
emotional regulation and emotional
strength a priority we need kids like
Bruin to lead the way I&#39;m proud that we
can be a force for good thank you
you
