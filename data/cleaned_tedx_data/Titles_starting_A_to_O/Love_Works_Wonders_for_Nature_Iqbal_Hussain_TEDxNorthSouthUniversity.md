thank you thank you very much
Tyler so Bangladesh when I say it the
first thing comes to our mind are the
cricketers at the Bangladeshi cricketers
because we all love them and they are
our Tigers but the question is how much
you know about our real Tigers please
raise your hand if you know how many
wild tigers you have in Bangladesh
anyone unless the reality we came
ourselves as a tiger nation but we know
very little about our wild tigers and
those who don&#39;t know we have honey and
six tigers left in the Sunderbans
and I am NOT not talk about this
cricketing team today I&#39;m going to talk
about a team devoted to save the world
higher the team spreading love love for
nature love for Tigers and I&#39;m also a
proud member of that team and I get this
question a lot why do you serve Tigers
what&#39;s in it for us very valid question
isn&#39;t it I have a very small answer to
start with very simple as well we say
Tigers because we have Tigers out of 195
countries in the world only 12 countries
have Tigers and we are one of them we
are pretty special and this majestic
beast is a very powerful symbol of our
history and pride you see Tiger
everywhere from the icon of the
cricketing team to the East Bengal
regiment our army to our currency Tiger
is deeply embedded into our culture and
can you imagine if you lose the Tigers
we will face identity crisis as a nation
let&#39;s look into the other side you could
lose Tyler from the Sunderbans we risk
losing our sunderbans
because Tiger is the natural dad of this
forest and shunned Ruben is the green
shield of the coast saving millions of
people every year from cyclones so we
don&#39;t just say Tigers
we are saving us how identity how many
of you have a visitation the band&#39;s
quite a few of them amazing this is our
Amazon forest isn&#39;t it the largest
mangrove forest in the world and the
only mango forest where you can get
Tigers pretty unique and I remember one
of my friends said that there&#39;s no Wi-Fi
in the forest but I promise you you will
get a better connection and American
poet and philosopher Henry David took me
to the next level he said I took a walk
into the woods and came out taller than
the trees you see love for nature can
make a big difference in your inner self
and the same love can transform the way
we think and take action and that&#39;s what
we asked ourselves when we started our
initiative and we realized to save
Tigers we have to say work with the
people the people living next to the
Sunderbans the people deal with the
forests and tigers every day because
without them we don&#39;t have any chance to
save the Tigers
the journey began in 2007 and it wasn&#39;t
a easy journey for us I&#39;m talking about
a time when 50 to 70 type of people get
attacked by Tiger every year two to
three Tiger beaten to them by the people
when they stay enter into a village
the conflict between human and Tiger was
unexpected and when we went to the Sun
Devils for the first time we are shocked
to see the day-to-day struggle of the
people due to poverty saving Tiger
should not be their priority at all they
are more concerned what they would eat
the next day but we believed in people
and we believe people are the solution
so we went there with an open mind we
started listening to them we want to
understand their world we want to see
the world from their perspective and we
saw there&#39;s a deep love and respect for
tigers and forests in their own ways one
thing they realized that as long as the
forest tribes they have a future but one
thing they don&#39;t know how to transform
their love into action and this is where
we started our word we designed the
campaign coefficient urban smile model
means model action the ones where people
can celebrate nature they can express
their love for nature this campaign
allowed them to connect emotionally with
the forest and the animals and research
shows that people take their decision
emotionally rather than rationally I&#39;m
sure some of you are thinking no brother
I take my decision logically I&#39;m a
logical person
I have a bad news for you Antonia
demacia then neuroscientists recently
discovered that what you believe about
the logical decisions the very point of
choice is based on emotion and thus with
that understanding we started designing
our camp in life should intervene is
like our mother the way mother Fitz&#39;s
protects us the shoulder once is
providing us fish honey and all the
services it protects us from the
cyclones and people forest and animals
we all are like a family and we lost
this campaign in 2012 in 26 unions of
five districts around the Sunderbans
and now after five years when I look
back I see love everywhere and most
importantly it&#39;s working let me tell you
a love story of a little girl one of our
team organized a campaign event in a
school near shondor Birns they showed
some campaign drama organize some games
for their students and discussions and
one of the guests were talking to some
students and he asked a little girl what
does your father do and the little girl
stood silent with head down she didn&#39;t
say anything so the guests moved to the
next student as he realized for some
reason the girl is not comfortable
answering the question after the event
that day she went home sad looking at
her her father asked what happened to
you why are you so sad and she replied
crying today there was a campaign in our
school and they showed how shondor Birns
is like your mother and all the animals
are like a family
surprise father our that&#39;s good what&#39;s
wrong with that then she said one of the
guests asked me what do you do for
and I couldn&#39;t answer it I&#39;m so ashamed
as I know you poached deer and birds
from the forest that one incident
changed the father forever he never went
back to the Sunderbans didn&#39;t poach
anymore and now he do the agriculture
and deliver in the in the village and
there are hundreds of such stories all
over the schindler ones now and we
learned a very lesson that if you want a
happy ending for nature and people it
has to be a love story and all these
were possible by this team of targeting
you started with the few volunteers from
the villages and nature lovers but now
who have more than 400 volunteers from
the villages engaged in this campaign
spreading love for nature and love for
Tigers and we have members who lost
their own families by Tiger attack let
me tell you another story of cows
immoral cow so Morel was a team leader
of rectangular how we tie the team in
shap here one day how some oil went to
the Sunderbans for fishing and suddenly
a tiger talked to me and he died
surprisingly the next day his son came
to us she is Merle and said he wants to
join Tiger team and he said my father
would want it as well because he taught
me the tiger is the savior of the forest
and we need the forest and Tiger killed
my father because my father went to his
home and now we have hundreds of members
like shears Moreau is doing wonder
saving all sorts of animal in the Sun
Devils over the years they saved three
the rescued three Tigers from the
village and send them back to the forest
not only Tigers there has been over 200
different wildlife including python deer
wild boar monitor lizard crocodile
events
and release them back into the forest
five years that you can&#39;t even think
about it and for the UH notable
contribution this team got the highest
recognition from the government the
bongo wonder wildlife conservation award
this year from the prime minister of
Bangladesh thank you I am receiving it
from on behalf of them but before I
finish I have a small request for you as
well I know we are the urban dwellers
with very little free time but whenever
you get some free spend please try to
visit any wild earnest at your
convenience of any distance I promise
you you will also find the connection I
mean one point you will also fall in
love with the nature and when you
probably love with nature you take your
own actions to do something about the
nature and the wildlife and eventually
you&#39;ll experience how a small act of
love can do wonders thank you very much
[Applause]
