I&#39;ve given presentations in the past
where I&#39;ve celebrated our
accomplishments of blue sky or talked
about the process beats behind some of
the movies we make or some technical
aspect of the work but one of the
suggestions I had for today was just to
talk about building the company what I
have is a is a story from my own
perspective chapter that well I think I
learned a lot about collaboration but
also some of the difficult the ways that
we finding creative clarity in an
environment when where there&#39;s just a
lot of input in the fall of 2001 blue
sky was about 15 years old and we were
months away from accomplishing something
that was just our grandest goal and that
was to deliver an animated feature film
the name of that movie was ice age and I
was directing it and like most efforts
on this scale it had been a tremendous
collaboration and one that I had felt
completely prepared for I&#39;d been making
little animated movies from the time I
was 12 or 13 years old I&#39;d gone to film
school I&#39;d won little prizes for my
short films I I&#39;d landed one of the
first jobs that ever existed in making
animation with computers I had a company
called Magi we did a lot of the
animation for the Disney movie Tron were
the first movies to make extensive use
of this and even after working on like
what was it then the bleeding edge of
this above this technology I went back
to school to learn more about it I just
want to know more about the technique in
the in the
technology then in 1987 a group of
former colleagues and friends and I
started our decided to start our own
company we had some very specific ideas
about how to do it right so we pulled
our life savings and we bought some of
the first workstation computers and and
some cheap office furniture and we had
at it that was the beginning of blue sky
now this was an era when if you&#39;re gonna
make animation with computers you had to
develop the technology to do it so it
was a couple of years before we even had
enough imagery to go out and peddle our
wares and then time after that before
we were getting little bits and pieces
of commercial work and then you know a
little bit more time went by and we
finally had more work than we could
handle
yeah which was great but we had you know
with that and expenses and and and we
had underbid all the work and the first
place thing to get it I remember driving
back to the studio one night after
having had a quick dinner with my family
feeling sorry for myself thinking about
all the mountains of nonsense I had to
get through before I was slept again and
and pulling into the into the parking
lot I saw there was a light on and I
remembered we&#39;d hired a freelancer and
we weren&#39;t paying ourselves yet but we
were paying them and they&#39;d been there
while I was gone for dinner and they
were gonna stay with me through the
night until work was done and from that
moment I and my colleagues dedicated
ourselves to developing and nurturing a
crew you know we started depending on
other people to help us and and and and
people joined us that shared the vision
understood the vision and this the crew
grew and the company grew ultimately
that vision was bigger than the one we
had started with which was great there
were enough people doing the work so
that I for one was left to do the things
that interested me the most I&#39;ve been
working on a short film from the day we
started the company and in 1998 would
help a lot of blue sky people we
finished it
and bunny went on to win awards around
the world including an Oscar for best
animated short film that year so with so
with the success of bunny and the
maturity of our our technology and our
crew we were given the opportunity to
make a feature film so ice age is the
story of three completely different
characters through completely different
animals that bond over what to do with a
human baby once a knuckleheaded sloth
one is a kind of duplicitous
saber-toothed tiger one is a
curmudgeonly mammoths it turns out they
have a heart of gold yeah I always from
the beginning I like the themes in the
movie about finding family where all the
members didn&#39;t look like each other and
and being able to accomplish something
together that no one individual could on
their own the only caveat was that the
studio that was financing the movie 20th
Century Fox wanted us to take what was
at the at that time a fairly straight
forward adventure movie and and turning
it into a comedy
there was no mean feat because well for
one thing the tiger wanted to eat the
baby
this was the Ice Age things were kind of
rugged you know we in the script we had
characters dropping off every other page
but we took this as a challenge and and
and we had at it now just a word about
the way animations made most people know
that to make a movie you write a script
and you gonna shoot it and you cut it
together and you have a movie
well animations made almost in reverse
order of this an animation we cut the
movie then we animate it ie to this
because it&#39;s animations time-consuming
and it&#39;s expensive what we do is we draw
little storyboards little quick drawings
of every shot of the movie or a
significant moment or you know
significant character pose or expression
we cut these all together into like a
comic book version of the movie it&#39;s a
quick way to see how the whole thing is
it&#39;s gonna is going to
it&#39;s an iterative process you know it&#39;s
easy to change things but imagine you&#39;ve
been working on this for months
sometimes up to a year thousands of
drawings pouring all of your genius
ideas into all this and then putting it
up and watching it for the first time
which is what I recommend the next time
you do this and and seem like you know I
put all my great ideas into this if it&#39;s
not playing exactly the way I thought it
was you know that that that joke right
there just isn&#39;t funny because there&#39;s
one awfully similar in the sequence
before it and and this in this moment
here isn&#39;t playing as emotionally as I
thought it would because we haven&#39;t
spent the time developing the characters
that enter that scene so you know you
can go back and work on it and get to
fix those little things and even make
them a little different but usually what
happens is after a little bit of time
the the the the movie starts moving into
places that you hadn&#39;t anticipated and
now now what do you do when kids are
really little
then they imprint on you they mimic you
remembers my daughter saying something
to me once and I don&#39;t remember exactly
what it was but but the effect for me
was was of my own voice coming back from
a tape recorder and I thought I&#39;m like
no no no no that doesn&#39;t sound right
coming out of your little face you know
you have to be use your own voice you
have to find your you know become your
own person
and in the same way you know I I went
back and I looked at these reels and I
realized I had to let the movie become
what it kind of what it wanted to and
become more of a guard and guard
Guardian to it and and just like just
try to try to nurture it and you know
and try to keep bad influences away from
it you never know I mean that was not to
let no influences on it because a spirit
of collaboration you never know when the
next best idea is is going to come from
but but you know you you know anyone I
want to impose your strict will on it to
keep it out of trouble to keep it safe
keep it alive now the most
interactive conversation I was having
about the story yeah at that point was
with the studio executives from from
20th Century Fox now these are the
people that are responsible for not only
the creative success of the movie but
the financial success of the movie so
it&#39;s a real rubber meets the road thing
it&#39;s not it&#39;s not an easy job and for
the most part you know we were trying to
make the same movie better as we went on
but you know I&#39;ll admit more than a few
times we had disagreements over things
like whether a joke was funny or not
explain why a jokes funny or you know
how much you know cartoon violence or
sarcasm or slow pacing a family audience
could tolerate now in the couple of
years two or two-and-a-half years that I
had been working on the movie that word
audience was probably not one that had
passed my lips but the studio knew they
were out there and the day came when
they they scheduled an audience preview
for the movie now an audience preview
for those of you that don&#39;t know is it&#39;s
where you it&#39;s a screening where you
recruit an audience that that matches a
demographic that you think the film is
intended for and you sit and you watch
it with them and afterwards often they
fill out a questionnaire or sometimes
they sit in a focus group and this
happens on just about every movie that
you see but this was this was my first
movie and part of me was thinking wow
there are a lot of opinions a lot of
opinion swarming around this right now
do they disagree with mine so much that
they&#39;re gonna leave it up to an audience
to decide what to do with this movie so
I&#39;ve given you a lot of this background
you know building the company up from
nothing and my lifelong you know quest
to get to this moment to help you
understand my perspective in this moment
you know the
you know my deserving feeling of being
in a tour on the movie wasn&#39;t gonna be
somebody in the audience that knew more
about my movie than I did and plus at
this point it&#39;s not finished you know
it&#39;s only half animated and so the rest
is in those story reels I was talking
about how are they even going to
understand it well the night before we
left on the preview for the preview we
sat and we watched the movie in
editorial and I just had the flattest
experience of it that I had had to that
point you know with the anxiety of my
excited about losing control and after
hearing the same jokes over and over
again a million times it just was it was
completely lifeless and I thought oh my
god you know they know something I don&#39;t
know they&#39;re there right you know I&#39;m
headed for a fall here so that Saturday
morning we pull up to a multiplex in a
suburb of Los Angeles and I see a line
of people sneaking out the entrance and
around the back of the building and
people of matching polo shirts and
clipboards and walkie-talkies walking
around and one of the producers said to
me well there&#39;s your audience so I
walked up to them and there&#39;s I got
close my my heart sank into my shoes
here were hundreds of people who at
first glance were and true to my
suspicions were completely different
than me you know different shapes and
sizes just to get started but but you
know different different clothes you
know different languages and and kids
running around in their own tiny worlds
distracting their parents I sat in the
back of this theater and it didn&#39;t have
an objective view of the of the room and
maybe to be close to the exit as these
kids climbed over seats and you know
some parents took them to get more soda
and candy and other parents just leaned
back and close their eyes and my career
and the future of our company was just
crumbling down around me yeah
the lights went down and that familiar
20th Century Fox logo
the fans that you know the klieg lights
giant thing a fanfare you know for my
poor half-finished movie hiding behind
the curtains you know just ready to get
walk out and give it all it had but you
know they started watching and and
before too long I realized that although
I had all these emotional histories and
you know knots and facial tics
associated with every beat that was
going by it was just another movie to
them and as they started reacting an
amazing thing started happening my
perspective aligned with theirs and and
the movie came to life they it it was
like they were interacting with with the
movie like it wasn&#39;t no it wasn&#39;t a one
way street it was like they were
projecting their imaginations into it
and in inflating it in so it seemed
almost as if the characters were you
know we&#39;re like reaching off the screen
and the space between the seats and the
screen was filled with this very
palpable energy of engagement and the
fluctuation of that or the intensity of
it became the only measure of creative
integrity that I was you know cared
about from from from from that moment
forward you know they didn&#39;t realize it
but they were collaborating with me at
that point it was probably the most
vivid moment of collaboration I had on
the whole project and it wasn&#39;t coming
from you know like an average of
different voices it was coming out of
this kind of communal intuition that was
coming out of this crowd of people that
I had seen so disparate only 20 minutes
before so I went right back to work on
it we worked hard with a renewed sense
of focus and confidence and by the time
we were done
we knew we had it you know the last
screening a kid in front of me literally
fell out of his chair laughing and and
there was a lady behind us I heard make
that little gasp when like one of them
you know one of our characters was
reunited with his heard and I and I you
know I don&#39;t say any of this to for my
own self aggrandizement it was you know
in order for it to work I had to get out
of the way a couple years ago later we
were we were approaching the end of our
next movie and we finally had some
finished footage to show to the CRO and
up it went and they owed and odd and
it&#39;s validated everything we&#39;d been
going after and helped them understand
where we were going and one of the
artists on the staff walked up to me
afterwards
a recent member to our crew but a but a
but a but a veteran of many other
animated movies and he said with a
wizened grin he said well here&#39;s where
the movie gets bigger than the people
that made it yeah bigger the people who
made it and then I thought that&#39;s deep
that&#39;s like what what what what what
does that mean I you know I couldn&#39;t
figure out it stuck with me and it felt
like kind of important and I&#39;ve always
had it in my head and I&#39;ve never quite
understood why you know is it that ok
you know you gather enough people and
together they put in more man-hours than
any one person has in a lifetime
there&#39;s bigger than oh I get that you
know or is it that intangible you know
whole is greater than the sum of its
parts and I think yeah well maybe you
know if you leave the movie alone do you
let it with all the influences around it
and all the help from everybody it
becomes something distinct from every
you know from the rest of it you know
but when I think about it you know after
working after all that work and they all
the effort it&#39;s like sitting in that
group in that audience you know in a
group of people that are completely
different on the outside you know and
you&#39;re all feeling the same thing
together on the ends
that&#39;s that&#39;s like the point to me
that&#39;s when it&#39;s working that&#39;s when
it&#39;s bigger than everybody and that&#39;s
what I&#39;ve been going with so thanks
[Applause]
