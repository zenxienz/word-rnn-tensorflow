No
yes my name is Papa che and I want to
talk about how AI artificial
intelligence can help me compose good
songs hit songs compelling songs but the
first thing I want to do is to come back
to nineteen 1964 because something very
important happened in our Western world
in 64 well I was born but another thing
has important happen and this is this
thing
[Music]
[Music]
the Beatles Beatlemania started more or
less in 64 and the world discovered his
songs with which we are so new so great
so creative at the time so compelling
and like many millions of people I was
born with his songs in my head not only
this song actually many other songs let
me play another song that probably you
know as well
[Music]
let me just play the intro for you that
you really have it in your head and it&#39;s
a song that every musician knows more
less well not only a musician every
everyone knows so it goes like this at
the beginning line and what happened
there it&#39;s a very lovely piece of sound
there is what we call a chromatic
descent like something like there is no
going down by half steps and it&#39;s
something that the beatles have invented
actually well there were things like
this in a classical music before but
they invented those kinds of things
those kinds of lovely patterns and they
invented many many other things in
harmony in sound and many things and
well being raised in this in this
culture i was always fascinated by how
can can someone or van invents such
lovely compelling things and so i always
wanted to become a composer myself and
do that kind of stuff and so I studied
music little bit I studied guitar and
stuff and I did I compose some songs
actually so there is something I compose
it&#39;s a jazz tune
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh yeah thanks but you should know it&#39;s
not the right time no not now
later later I will tell you otherwise it
ruins the show what I wanted to say that
it&#39;s okay but it&#39;s not as great okay as
those great songs by the Beatles The
Beach Boys and many others okay
and so I didn&#39;t become a composer I mean
I do this as a hobby basically and I did
other things I basically I I became an
AI researcher I mean I turned out badly
but as an ER researcher it&#39;s a natural
question what hey I can do to help me
compose songs composed better song I&#39;m
not talking about composing just like
kilometer music talking about composing
really good new creative songs
what AI can do and so AI and music is a
very old story actually the first the
very first applications of computers
were already in AI mu zyk in 1958 the
index wit was the first AI music
composition in the style of bass so it&#39;s
really hold it&#39;s not a not a little new
but in the same style in recently this
year actually we had the quite
spectacular result in the team trying to
model the style of Sebastian Sebastian
Bach using deep learning artificial
intelligence techniques and I want to
show you a little bit so that you get
you know you understand what it&#39;s about
so basically the problem is of FIBA is
that back has composed Corral&#39;s which
are for poor four part pieces there is a
soprano melody here and then there are
three other voices and it&#39;s a very
specific style so this is an example of
what ba has composed
[Music]
and it has been a long a long time then
since computer scientists and AI
researchers try to generate to make
program that could generate that kind of
stuff and now with AI what we can do is
we don&#39;t have to write programs so we
can feed machine learning algorithms
with the chorus that back has composed a
few hundreds and these algorithms can
look at the statistics of what&#39;s going
on which not go often which with which
other nodes and stuff like that
statistics and then these models can be
used to generate new new pieces in the
same style so here I will show you what
we can generate in the same style but
also keeping the same Soprano so you
will hear the same piece with the same
soprano sorry but all the voices the
other voices are composed by the machine
so and you will hear with a flute sound
and this is a stem called deep bass deep
learning for back depe designed by a guy
who is a PhD student in the team this is
what you get you see the same soprano
here but the different orchestration
[Music]
so you see it sounds pretty much like
back and we have shown that even trained
professional trained musician would
consider that this as almost as good or
almost not distinct distinguishable from
back alright okay but we are thumbs trap
from the Beatles right I mean this is a
nice piece of musics not as exciting not
as compelling so music is about
statistics yes but not only I mean there
are other things in there there actually
many other things so we had to look at
other dimensions and statistics and a
few years ago I designed a system called
continued ATAR which taught us a lot of
things about what is musical excitement
so it is in this system basically what
happened is that you had a pianist for
instance improvising so this is the
pianist here Albert von Baden that is
going to improvise and the system would
just listen and when the guys stops
playing the system continues you know
the phrase by in the same style by
trying to elaborate on the motif that we
are just play let me just show you two
seconds of this here
[Music]
improvised and system continues
something different it&#39;s really
interesting and it goes on and goes on
like this for four hours and the guy
listens to himself actually the machine
has captured his own style and is
elaborating on that and money has enough
you will play again machine stops all
right and so sorry so what we learned
with this is that a big part of the
excitement in music comes from the
fascination of what we have inside us
that we are not yet able to realize and
this is what the machine would do you
know you would play something and
machine would do would play as if it was
you but in a kind of near future it was
so it&#39;s very excited was very exciting
for many people it was exciting for the
users not so much for the audience so we
still not they&#39;re quite you know but we
learn a lot of things with this thing
and more recently well this is just only
slightly a cryptic slide I have but
recently we have been working on trying
to extend those statistic models with
more constraints that to take into
account more dimensions of music in
particular rhythm and meter
I will not detail these things too much
well I want to show here is the song
Michele you know I&#39;m a this thing is
about focus I&#39;m really focused on
Michele and let&#39;s say obsessed but this
is the kind of model that the system
computer can build from the analysis of
this song and when it showed here it&#39;s a
probabilistic automaton it shows there
that the system is able somehow to
generalize to make it bigger it&#39;s going
not to be able on not only to play
sure that many other things that are in
the same style and these kinds of object
can be created automatically now what do
we do with this well we built a tool
called flow machines to help people
compose songs and of course the first
thing we did was to compose a song in
the style of the Beatles so what we did
is we fed the system with about 40
titles of the beaters including Michelle
yes
but others and it has some success on on
YouTube you know for a researcher one
point five million views is really a
time and usually we have like eighty
four views one when we do something and
I want to show you what what there is
inside so that you understand the point
so this is a the first seconds of this
song called Daddy&#39;s car so in composed
with this AI
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I cannot pastry minute-long please go
and increase our view count I want to
play an extract a bit later in the song
okay and you have to listen to it
carefully a bit later a few seconds
later you have this
[Music]
does it tell you something so let me
take this extract transpose it a bit
below make it sound a bit lower in pitch
the same thing so now let&#39;s go back to
Michelle the beginning of Michelle all
the same harmonically you have the same
chromatic descent and if you don&#39;t
believe me now I will play the both
things together so one will be on the
right one on the left so the beginning
of Michelle and the extract of that song
composed by the AI okay so please listen
carefully what I want to say here is
that what did the AI do it somehow
captures this bit of Michelle I did not
ask it to do him to do it I did it by a
by chance and replaced it in another
context which it created and so to reuse
it in a creative way so this is exactly
what AI can do to help us and find
inspiration as they&#39;re taking bits of
things which exist more or less we
tweaking them and risk and setting them
in new context and this is I think very
very interesting it&#39;s going to open a
lot of new ways to make music so let me
continue and show you other things that
AI can do what I&#39;ve shown here is
basically about school abouts what we
call symbolic music nodes harmony chords
and stuff like that rhythm but here we
want to play with sound sound texture so
let&#39;s do a cover of well let&#39;s let&#39;s do
a cover of Michelle you know for a
change
but using another technique or style
transfer so the thing I will do is okay
I will take this song by
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Stevie Wonder is one of the great
geniuses like the Beatles he has
invented so many things but here I will
not talk about him I will just take this
introduction of loves in liver of love
of love today because I like the sound
right and then I will take another piece
of music of sound sorry I will take I
will take McKelvey bliss voice in a song
called everything you&#39;re a phone stop
you&#39;re the getaway car you&#39;re the line
in the sand and what I want to do is to
create a cover of Michelle you have
heard both vision right so you remember
this song and I want to map these two
sounds onto this Michelle score and this
process of mapping is called sty
transfer so just for fun you know this
is what you get
[Music]
you recognize I guess the melody of
Michele recognize the voice recognition
so what we are doing here is completely
automatic by the way there is just you
just select the sounds press click and
that&#39;s it
so what you get here is we could say an
interesting cover a cover is just
another orchestration interpretation of
an existing song it&#39;s not composition
right but it&#39;s interesting because those
tools are going to help us think about
new ways of orchestration okay
orchestrating a song let me show you
some other covers in the lab wheel that
we liked very much the beaters but also
Brazilian music like Tom Jobim who is
like Stevie Wonder McCartney one of the
great geniuses of our Western
civilization and so we like for instance
Girl From Ipanema okay so there is a
girl from Ipanema but from a sty
transfer of amount of Marvin Gaye
[Music]
so you can recognize the intonation
expression of mark of course Marvin
Gaye&#39;s never sang sang this song another
example which nice is a one not Samba we
buy the same Jobim
[Music]
do you get the idea and so on I want to
insist that this is not composition but
this is no work either just one click
you know selection of what you want to
map selection of the target lead sheet
target song this one that one we have a
database with all the songs in the world
and then selection of an audio file and
any try and it works so it doesn&#39;t work
I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s nice or not I don&#39;t
know but at least this is the kind of
tool that we are going to have very soon
let me show you something more creative
because these work covers covers is
again an existing song that you re
orchestrate so we did obsessed by Tom
Jobim as well we loved this song which
is called in sunset days which is very
well known I will play rock performance
by drawer drawer Giotto with great
Brazilian guitarist but so and then what
I will show that we try to do new
composition with the same kind of
patterns and in particular pay attention
to the fact that the melody is very
chromatic you have very small movements
between notes
alright so this is
[Music]
give us a face so my sink with our very
nice song it&#39;s really hard to do that
really
so what we did is we fed the system with
lots of Tom Jobim songs this one this
one and many others and we asked a new
song this is what we got
it&#39;s nice no well you don&#39;t read music
fluently all right you can see that
there are lots of chromatic chromatic
stuff also that the notes don&#39;t don&#39;t be
do big jumps all right but let me play
this with tile transfer so that it&#39;s
nicer than just a MIDI file so what we
did here is we took King Crimson&#39;s voice
and a bit of stock transfer from song by
Bill McRea French musician we work with
and this is what we get
[Music]
every beauty
[Music]
I&#39;m talking
[Music]
is not
[Music]
and what I think is really interesting
in there that&#39;s you you have you do
recognize the chromatic dimension which
is really hard actually to specify but
yet it&#39;s a completely different song
it&#39;s not a pleasure it&#39;s completely
different so you you see what the ayah
is a is going to do is going to let you
explore at the fringe of existing stuff
it&#39;s not going to do plagiarism or
copy-paste but go a little bit farther
and let you course control all that let
me show you something more creative so
this is a jazz singer committee Otto who
is really fantastic by the West well
concept we did in October in Paris last
October and she sings a song that&#39;s real
that&#39;s generated on the fly just by a
click so she has never seen the song she
sees the score and then she sings it
just to show that you can create from
scratch and this isn&#39;t the style of Bill
Evans Bill Evans is yet another genius
who has composed a lot of very nice jazz
tunes very sophisticated so this is what
you get now a full song it&#39;s a so short
trot song it&#39;s 12 bars very short just
to that you get the idea of what you can
do now
I
[Music]
to
[Music]
nevermind
I have to skip okay this is one click
and of course if you click again you
have something else
so what these algorithms algorithms do
is sampling that is they generate a lot
of different things each time you use
them some of them are good that&#39;s good
some of them are really good so then
it&#39;s a matter of choice and selection I
mean from the user this is why we really
need the user not only user about a
musician but you see the kind of stuff
that we can do with AI so this was in
the style of Bill Evans I want to stop
right now just by giving you some
examples of real things we have been
doing this is something for a French
television that&#39;s going to be broadcast
very soon from the celebration of the
prints with either one year ago so we
want we wanted to do something with
songs from prints with a jazz a composer

mediary : young French a composer and
trumpet trumpet player and which with
some sounds from Miles Davis also so
this is just to show you that we are not
doing only demos but actual music is a
groovy kind of drew drew jazz with a few
seconds
[Music]
[Music]
so you recognize the voice of Buble okay
again my capably and are very nice
suddenly you know melodic traits that
come from nowhere the I I suggest this
and all the sounds here are generated by
the AI and the last thing I want to show
is mainstream music we need a title
well Bernie McCauley the composer
working with us wanted to do something
mainstream you&#39;re really popular but see
how a I because AI you can do very crazy
stuff you know but what about non crazy
stuff you know this is actually harder
to do sometimes so here we did a song we
did a song from inspired from a Michelle
Beltre with a popular French composer
died now but and a lot of sounds from
many people like be a pet or winter the
voice of Elvis Presley you will
recognize the type vibrato probably and
lots of sounds pete seeger coming from
here and there taken on the web and so
it&#39;s called magic man let&#39;s just fill a
few seconds of this
[Music]
boys the oldest is generated
[Music]
all right so I will stop conclude as I
will answer my question can i hi help me
compose songs I say yes but the real the
real proof will come when people say yes
not only me you know not like myself but
the audience so we are now finishing at
first what will be the first album pop
album well there will be some pop
electronic music hip hop a bit of jazz
which we should be out in the coming
month and then well we&#39;ll see
right what other thing other people
think thank you very much
[Applause]
[Music]
