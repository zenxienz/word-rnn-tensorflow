so my grandfather was kind of my hero
growing up he was kind smart super
passionate about every little thing he
was doing and really argumentative about
it too he was happy successful loved his
family and if you asked me what living a
good life meant when I was a kid I would
have told you it was to be like my
granddad so when he was diagnosed with
cancer when I was 14 it shattered my
world we were gonna go on vacation that
summer but his doctors found two tumors
at the same time one in his throat and
another in his brain so instead I spent
that summer watching week-by-week
month-by-month as he got sicker and
frailer and also heartbreakingly
forgetful and paranoid he was given
medicine that kept him alive a little
bit longer but he never really was
himself again and in my last
conversations with him he talked with me
about how terrifying it was knowing that
day by day he was slipping away knowing
that he wasn&#39;t getting better when he
died I fell into a depression I couldn&#39;t
stop thinking about the fact that no
matter how good of a life we live every
one of us has the same thing waiting for
us that my granddad months or years of
suffering of some terrible disease like
cancer or dementia or a stroke what was
the point of getting A&#39;s in school or
scoring the winning goal in the big game
if that&#39;s all we had to look forward to
I spent months feeling this way and it
wasn&#39;t until I stumbled across an idea
that I was finally able to crawl out of
that depression I latched on to
something that gave me a purpose what if
I spent my life fighting against those
diseases so that other people didn&#39;t
have to suffer from them the way that my
granddad did that purpose has been
keeping me going until this very day so
there I was I had my epiphany the big
idea but had no idea how to go about
doing it how could I fight against the
diseases that had killed every single
person I knew who had died I started
casting around and learning as much as I
could and it didn&#39;t take me long to find
something interesting
well cancer and heart attacks are
today&#39;s biggest killers they haven&#39;t
always been as recently as nineteen
hundred people died of infectious
diseases the leading causes of death
were pneumonia tuberculosis and
influenza and the average life
expectancy was 45 years old doctors and
scientists spent the last century
struggling heroically against these
diseases and we invented antibiotics and
vaccines in order to fight them those
were the biggest challenges of the 20th
century and we&#39;ve been so successful
fighting them that now we live in a
world where the average life expectancy
is 80 and in developed countries all ten
of the two leading causes of death are
caused by simply living long enough to
not die of anything else the 21st
century will be defined by our struggle
against these diseases of aging and it&#39;s
not going to be an easy one for 75 years
these have been the leading causes of
death for Humanity
and everything that we&#39;ve done to fight
them has barely made a dent in the
number of people dying of any one of
them in fact they&#39;re rising as a
fraction of total deaths in the world as
we continue to make strides against
infectious disease malnutrition and
violence around the world you see as a
society we look to medicines to make us
well when we&#39;re sick and so far almost
everything that we&#39;ve designed to treat
the diseases of Aging has fit in that
paradigm we wait for someone to get
cancer to have a stroke or start losing
their memories and then try to do
something about it
but this approach hasn&#39;t really been
working since 2000 we&#39;ve done 200
clinical trials and humans just for
Alzheimer&#39;s disease and 99 percent of
those have failed the two that succeeded
haven&#39;t even given us a drug that does
much to treat Alzheimer&#39;s disease we
spend over 20 billion a year on cancer
research and trials but most of the
gains that we&#39;ve made against cancer
since 1970 have come from better
diagnosis of cancer not from curing the
disease this should tell us that we&#39;re
doing something wrong in our approach to
the diseases of aging because unlike
infections the diseases of aging are
caused by the slow gradual buildup of
damage to our bodies over a lifetime
before they ever caused enough of a
problem for us to go see a doctor and by
the time that we go see that doctor so
much has happened inside of our bodies
that there&#39;s not much that they can do
to help us so this is how I started my
academic career I was one of a small
group of scientists and we were all
thinking the same thing
if we ever wanted to eliminate
Alzheimer&#39;s and cancer the way that we
eliminated smallpox we would have to
take a different approach to health care
we would have to treat the diseases of
aging by anticipating them
building medicines that could remove
damage caused by getting old before it
ever accumulated enough to make us sick
and this kind of makes sense right
because we all feel the effects of
getting old right now even when we&#39;re
not sick
I mean who here can run as fast as they
could when they were 18 years old
because if some 18 year olds in the
audience nice or maybe bounce back up
after falling out of a tree like they
could when they were 12 I&#39;m by no means
old and even though my risk of
osteoporosis or cancer is diminishing
Lee small I am getting older just like
all of you are my blood vessels are
hardening my neurons are starting to get
tired my DNA is mutating I&#39;m losing the
battle to keep my cells and tissues in
good condition right now we only think
of this progressive accumulation of
damage as a problem when everything goes
to hell and it erupts as some kind of
disease if we want to stop this gradual
buildup of damage in our bodies we&#39;re
told that the only things that we can do
are eat better exercise avoid smoking
hope that we&#39;ve gotten lucky with our
genes it&#39;s not exactly a hopeful message
we&#39;re not leveraging the power of modern
medicine to prevent us from getting sick
from the things that are killing us the
most but that&#39;s all changing because for
the first time in history we understand
what makes us get older we&#39;ve traced to
the biochemical level the diseases of
Aging and what causes them and we&#39;ve
been able to categorize the damage of
aging into 9 buckets things like the
random mutations of DNA
or the exhaustion of our stem cells our
understanding is now at the cellular and
molecular level which means that we can
actually design medicines to target and
treat these things and those medicines
actually exist we have a repository of
over 50 interventions whether a small
molecule drug or a genetic change that
can extend healthy life by as much as
50% think about that 50% longer without
getting Alzheimer&#39;s disease or cancer or
having a stroke or having our bones and
muscles wear down 50% in mice
and so the mice are super excited about
this but what does it mean for us humans
well luckily this is how new medicines
are usually born we take a piece of
research and test it in mice to see if
it works and if it does then we advance
that to cute to human trials and the
good news is we&#39;ve got 50 things that
are ready to test but making the jump
from mice to humans for these sorts of
diseases won&#39;t exactly be
straightforward you see a trial to
prevent a disease instead of treat it
has some additional challenges it&#39;s more
time consuming and more expensive which
means that companies which have to pave
the tens of millions of dollars for
these trials are often hesitant to do so
when they&#39;re used to doing the more
traditional reactive trials however we
have a glimmer of hope here too
that may be able to fast-track some of
these preventative medicines into the
clinic you see if you build a medicine
that does a good job preventing damage
which could eventually cause a disease
it turns out that the same medicine can
stop a disease from getting any worse by
halting that same damage and sometimes
we can even repair the damage reversing
the effects of a disease now if you
caught yourself thinking well wait that
sounds completely obvious I might
forgive you for that
it does seem reasonable that if
something is going wrong with my cells
and I fix that thing then it would help
whether or not I&#39;ve labeled my cells
diseased or not but until very recently
we just didn&#39;t know that because it
hadn&#39;t really been tested the people who
were working on studying what goes wrong
in an old Mouse and the people who were
giving treatments to Alzheimer&#39;s
patients weren&#39;t really talking to each
other but now they are an are
with this new knowledge of what makes us
age and what we can do about it we&#39;re
able to pursue two ambitious goals at
the same time first we have the ability
to create new medicines to treat
patients suffering from the diseases of
aging this is what motivates me and the
people that I work with every single day
using this new research to come up with
a medicine that can impact millions of
people who are sick right now but
there&#39;s also a second thing we can be
doing as we create new medicines from
these diseases and test them in the
traditional way we have to remember that
what we really want is a medicine that
can prevent disease instead of just
treating it and to get there we&#39;re going
to need to have proven safe effective
medicines targeted at treating the
damage of Aging and there&#39;s been
progress on this front as well one of
the 50 interventions that I told you
guys about before happens to be an
approved drug that&#39;s already been used
in humans for decades so after results
in mice came out showing that we could
extend their health span a group of
researchers started combing through
hundreds of thousands of patient records
who had been taking this drug and they
found something incredible this drug
which people didn&#39;t take to prevent the
diseases of Aging they took to prevent
their blood glucose from going up
because they had diabetes but when they
were on this drug they had a lower
incidence of both cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s
disease even compared to healthy people
that didn&#39;t have diabetes so this thing
may actually be working this drug which
is called metformin can extend Mouse
lifespan on average by five to ten
percent which if it worked the same in
humans would mean four to eight extra
healthy years and that&#39;s a lot because
if we invented a pill that
oculus Li cured all cancer in all of
humanity right now we would expect an
average lifespan gain of about three and
a half years because we would succumb to
another disease as we got older so based
on this research a new clinical trial
has started to test whether people who
are healthy can take metformin and avoid
cancer and Alzheimer&#39;s disease so you
might want to wait for the results of
that trial before you go beg your doctor
for diabetes meds so now you may be
asking yourself whether it&#39;s this trial
or another medicine that gets approved
who&#39;s going to pay for these
preventative medicines and it&#39;s worth
pausing here to reflect for a moment
that insurance companies are actually
already paying for something very
similar many of us in this room may be
taking medicines that lower our
cholesterol which reduce the chances of
getting a stroke when we invent new
medicines that can not just reduce your
chances of getting a stroke but also
Alzheimer&#39;s disease and cancer which are
way more expensive for those insurance
companies to treat you can bet that
they&#39;ll be lining up to pay for those
drugs too with insurance companies in
the game
this means that pharma companies are
going to pay top dollar for the rights
to test and sell these medicines and
that means that scientists working at
universities or at biotech companies are
going to be competing with each other to
create the next greatest preventative
medicine it&#39;s a positive feedback loop
and the cycle can be kicked off with
just one victory even a drug that
extends healthy lifespan by a year or
two can start a cycle of investment and
research and testing that can change the
way we do health care forever and I have
good news because there are 50
interventions that we already have ready
to go we just need to get to work as I
close up here I think it&#39;s worth
addressing
one little thing which is that I get
asked all the time if we even should be
trying to treat aging or extend life and
I think that this is absolutely the
wrong question I think the question that
we should be asking ourselves is when do
you want to get Alzheimer&#39;s disease when
do you want to have a stroke when do you
want your muscles to break down for most
of these I think everyone that I know
will say never it&#39;s like asking somebody
in 1900 and what age they like to get
tuberculosis or polio
no thank you the evidence that we have
suggests that we can make new medicines
based on our understanding of Aging that
can help people who are suffering from
today&#39;s biggest killers yes this will
change healthcare it will redefine
medicine in the 21st century the same
way that vaccines and antibiotics
redefined medicine in the 20th but
that&#39;s good that&#39;s progress because I
want to be able to enter the 22nd
century and face our newest medical
challenges whatever those may be we have
the opportunity in our lifetimes
to flip healthcare on its head by
wetting the power of modern medicine
with our understanding of what makes us
age we&#39;re going to invent new medicines
that can treat the damage caused by
getting old before we ever get sick and
that that&#39;s a future that I can look
forward to thank you
you
