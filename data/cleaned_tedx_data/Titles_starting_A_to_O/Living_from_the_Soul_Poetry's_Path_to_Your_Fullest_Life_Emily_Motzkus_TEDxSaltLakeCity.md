imagine you&#39;re in a music class I pass
out sheet music I teach you about notes
octaves and instruments pitch and tone
we discussed time signatures and
repeating Coda&#39;s sonatas and rap all
semester I tell you music is amazing I
proclaim certain melodies bring people
to tears I tell you how much I love
music but I never play you a single song
I only let you write and read music on a
page I never let you strum a guitar or
beat a drum
we never sing I never offer you the
experience of music and then I wonder
why don&#39;t you like music I say why don&#39;t
you get it
you look frustrated this brings me to
poetry last year poet Ben Lerner
published a book titled the hatred of
poetry clearly poetry has problems
Lerner explains one many more people
agree they hate poetry then can agree
what poetry is what is poetry is it that
hard to define or enjoy
is it like music is the experience
essential to its understanding there are
foundational poetic experiences yes
experiences you did not receive in
school because these poetic glimmers are
not testable and therefore you are not
taught them I know this because I taught
boring confusing bad poetry lessons and
watched as they failed the wisdom of our
greatest poets welcome to the University
of Denver fall of 2015 I thought I had
made it I survived a summer of 10 our
study days past my comprehensive exams I
was finally finished with my own
coursework and for the first time in
nearly a decade of graduate study I was
going to teach an elective course for
once my students chose to study the art
of poetry they were gonna like poems and
I had built a syllabus of life-changing
poems that afternoon when I walked into
the classroom I truly believed I had a
gift to give that semester I would
change my students life but here&#39;s what
changed mine they didn&#39;t care they
didn&#39;t want my gift and although they
had elected to take my course they
actually wanted to watch house of cards
with one ear button flirt eat burritos
browse Facebook whisper sleep and eight
weeks later once again I had become a
poetry which leading a silent and
miserable classroom but this semester
was extra bad no one did the reading and
I felt forced to give a pop quiz at the
start of every class then I would braid
those quizzes on the spot and kick
everyone out of class except to studious
English nerds each night on the drive
home I would cry then I would lie on my
apartment floor and eat chips and cry
I googled new career options I took
online strengths finder tests what&#39;s a
few more years of school I solved
jealous of my sister who was becoming a
lawyer I wondered if I even liked poetry
I wondered why I have made such a
terrible life mistake becoming a poet
why didn&#39;t my parents stop me why did I
get the lucky elective class containing
11 fraternity bros why this fall was
supposed to be different looking back on
it I can see that my life breakdown
wasn&#39;t about some students who didn&#39;t do
their reading but they were Mearing back
to me what it really was through the
course of my education I had begun to
believe poetry was valueless this was
pretty terrifying I had spent my entire
professional development on the study of
poems poetry was my identity income
well-being and honestly this was
something I was insecure about did I
have any real
value when I would sit next to a
stranger on a plane or converse with
someone standing in a line the moment I
told them I was getting a PhD in poetry
they would all get a weird face and say
the exact same thing what are you gonna
do with that teat when was the last time
you purchased a book of contemporary
poetry yeah I was gonna teach but at
that moment I hated teaching and the
harder I tried to excite or explain
poetry to my students the more blank
stares I met if you think taking a
poetry class is bad
try leading one why couldn&#39;t I convey
everything I understood and loved why
was I sailing miserably that leads me to
this moment standing in front of you
wanting to tell you what feels like a
lost secret a hidden gem something the
poets know keep to themselves and use in
their life but that&#39;s something school
silences poet Robin blazer of the San
Francisco Renaissance explains the
problem we wind up at the University of
California you can&#39;t use the word spirit
soul any of those things because they
belong to a non rationalist view now
it&#39;s very hard to understand what that
means except you weren&#39;t supposed to use
them contemporary poet
Nathaniel Mackay explains today&#39;s
problem like this we live at a time in
history here in the United States in
which nothing exists unless you can see
it touch it smell it or hold it in your
hands Sol doesn&#39;t exist in that
mentality in an interview Mackey
explains the necessity of continuing to
pursue soul
despite the term being bracketed and
even out of fashion in poetry quarters
where that term has traditionally been
at home Mackey&#39;s work is brave and vital
for poetry in school we teach poetry as
a literary art but that is only one-half
it&#39;s not a smaller fraction of poetic
experience poetry existed long before
there was any such thing as literature
poetry is first and foremost a spiritual
art form I speak for myself when I say
for fear of looking naive not rational
not academic I talked around the vital
half the half that is the experience the
knowing the silent sound behind the
words but doing so I was teaching the
terrible music class I described earlier
I was missing the most important aspect
poet Barbra guest of the New York school
of poets explains that aspect the most
important act of a poem is to reach
further than the page so that we are
aware of another aspect of the art this
will introduce us to the spiritual
essence the essence has no limits the
guest was concerned that in the
institution there was what she called a
demise of the spirit and during her life
she worried poetry and therefore the
meanings we make in our life would start
to reflect that spiritual absence her
concern has come true in the majority of
classrooms across America like in mind
that absence is a reality and the
reasons feel complex historically poets
were messengers of the gods today we are
careful to separate church and state in
public school but let me be clear
poetry is not any type of religion it&#39;s
completely free of doctrine and dogma
every religion race sexual orientation
gender has a poet still it is a human
experience that involves a spiritual
realization
a sacred Epiphany to use the term of the
ancient Greeks furthermore an instructor
really shouldn&#39;t give away their beliefs
science can&#39;t prove a spiritual
dimension academics can&#39;t even agree
what poetry is the silent absence that
bracket it&#39;s very present and yet it
missing I believe the missing element in
the poetry classroom is the missing
experience in our daily life when we
have meaning but we don&#39;t have
meaningfulness we have words on a page
but we don&#39;t feel poetry it&#39;s the
fullness of meaning that we all crave
the experience of our fullness that&#39;s
what a poetic experience offers to each
of you but if we&#39;re missing the
foundational teaching of poetry the
personal experience of our spiritual
essence then we&#39;re missing the poetic
dimension in our life and that&#39;s sad
because poetry&#39;s dimension is life
itself to have wife to be a wife to be
filled with spirit to live on a planet
with others and oceans and flowers to
see that beauty as your own that
fullness cannot be put into words it is
as guest said beyond the page it has
nothing to do with rhymes metaphors or
memorization it won&#39;t help if I ask you
to count the ambach pentameter x&#39; and
sonnets are the syllables in haiku no
amount of literary analysis will tell me
your souls experience when you bite into
a summer&#39;s peach no paper you write will
reveal the vitality of your being when
you dive in the sea and no literary term
will explain the feeling of holding a
newborn baby watching the totality
moment of an eclipse seeing your partner
smile or being in the room when someone
you love takes a final breath
it won&#39;t work if I tell you the poem has
one correct meaning that these
experiences have one correct fullness
that there&#39;s something to get that you
don&#39;t already have so if your poetry
class left you feeling like poetry is
useless I want to offer you a way to
create poetic value in
your own life so you can experience
poetry&#39;s rapture for yourself one night
during the poetic crisis of my life I
realized I had ironically forgotten the
one thing poetry teaches better than any
other subject how to make meaning not
just flat arbitrary meaning but soul
fulfilling meaning then it occurred to
me if I just started living and teaching
the exact same way I write or read a
poem maybe I could find what I was
missing the question became how could I
reverse-engineer poetic experience the
unspeakable experience of poetry for
myself for my students so we could all
feel it individually create it in our
days and let its presence help us live
our life as wallace stevens famously
wrote this question took me off the page
back to a very ancient poetry where to
be inspired inspir ra meant to breathe
or blow into to be filled with spirit
the breath of life and poetry poesis
meant only to make or making and Plato
argued anyone who made something from
nothing was a poet that&#39;s the poetry I
now teach to CEOs and other innovators a
spiritually liberated poetry a life
liberated poetry the poetic art of how
to be inspired how to be filled with
life and then make something meaningful
from nothing now poets although they
work in the line of sages prophets and
mystics they&#39;re just ordinary people
maybe a little out there but they are
living in a world full of joy and making
deep meaning every day as they witness
spiritual essence in everything William
Carlos Williams has a poem where he sees
divinity and a man gathering dog poo the
old man who goes
out gathering dog line walks in the
gutter without looking up and his tread
is more majestic than that of the
Episcopal minister approaching the
pulpit of a Sunday these things astonish
me beyond words that same astonishment
lives inside you you all have your own
criterion for truth and beauty you all
have the ability when you get quiet to
render yourself speechless you can
create your own inspiration and bring
yourself to a place beyond language
that&#39;s what I love most about poetry
most of us live our life thinking
inspiration is something we have to wait
around for we&#39;re waiting for the idea to
strike for the moment we can be creative
and yes inspiration does strike but a
poet also knows they can make their own
inspiration they can fill themselves
with the breath of life all they have to
do is start making it bringing attention
to their existence to the magnificence
of being alive and in rapture of that
that is the first meaning the poet makes
and when we start making meaning there
with that incredible but simple but
incredible awareness anything we ask is
only going to blow us open with beauty
and wonder as your poetry teacher I have
to teach you first how to be alive I
have to let you feel the enormousness of
living I have to offer you space to
create your own inspiration to fill your
own spiritual essence you must
experience that beyond words swell of
connection and power to your life first
before I can teach you to make anything
with it but if you are alive you have
already started making poetry and the
person who enters completely into the
experience of poesis of making will be
initiated into a deeper intimacy with
life itself
so go transcend follow your impulses
make life breathe life with the
awareness and silent wonder of what Walt
Whitman&#39;s saying that you are here that
life exists and identity that the
powerful play goes on and you may
contribute a verse for when you live
poetically you are responsive to your
deepest voice the callings truce and
truest expression whether in words
whether in paint whether in business or
in a garden of your being
I won&#39;t define it what is poetry it&#39;s
limitless but it is and what&#39;s a song
without the pulse behind it it&#39;s your
life without your soul behind it it&#39;s
the world without humanity&#39;s beauty and
fullness behind it we are all masters
all poets all conductors we only have to
open up and discover what is already
here I will leave you with one final
consideration dear
beings welcome to earth you have arrived
there will be raging rivers and stars
and you can travel to the South of
France
climb the mist in Bhutan and every
single day a sunset and yeah it will
hurt but there will be dazzling cities
and wind and somewhere in between you
will love and you will die and that all
of it is poetry those are the opening
words to the poetry class you never took
and I never taught thank you
you
[Applause]
