in his famous commencement speech David
Foster Wallace tells the story of two
fish who swim alone at some point the
two young fish meet an older fish who
happens to be swimming the other
direction who nods at them and says
morning boys how&#39;s the water now the two
young fish swim on and at some point one
looks at the other and says what the
hell is water now indeed what the hell
is water did any of you ever thought
about that now imagine that you are one
of the two young fish who actually
realizes that this is water and by this
realization you can actually start
enjoying the water you can start
exploring that water and as you swim
along and as you enjoy your life because
you notice that there&#39;s different
temperatures to water you also notice
that there are different currents and
those currents in some way affect your
life and behavior because sometimes you
have to swim in a very hard way and it&#39;s
hard to swim if you&#39;re swimming against
the current and then if you swim with
the currents it&#39;s much easier and you
notice that actually the same currents
affect other fish and so once you know
how it affects you you can actually know
how it affects other fish and therefore
you can be predict their behavior and so
you know that there is water and at some
point maybe you know there&#39;s air you
decide to swim up and you jump up and
say wow this is like a different
universe it&#39;s not wet sand it&#39;s not
sticky this is new and so you know what
is water and you know what it&#39;s air and
then maybe just maybe at some point you
do notice that there&#39;s land and you get
curious about land 400 million years ago
the first fish came on land and start
the revolution of evolution although of
the species that we know now this fish
was a rebel who was a revolutionary and
that fish was our ancestor that fish
hacked the system by realizing what is
water now what about the other fish the
one that didn&#39;t realize what is water
what that fish probably still swims
around and looks at other things say
what the hell was that
and that fish probably sooner or later
will end up on a fish hook on a fish
ball or on our plate fast forward couple
hundred million years to fairly recent
times of 399 BC we find ourselves in the
great city of Athens at the Athens
square the town square there&#39;s an older
man walking around and talking to the
youth and he&#39;s asking them weird
questions he says why do you do what you
do could you do something else what do
you think what you think he&#39;s
challenging their assumptions he say why
do you think this is impossible what do
you think this is possible
who told you so he&#39;s telling them to
know themselves because he says if you
know yourself you also know the gods now
his name is socratis he is the father of
Western philosophy he was a rebel
revolutionary and the first modern
hacker socratis was sentenced to death
for impiety and corruption of the youth
but his know thyself is one of the best
hacking tools
ever invented fast forward two and a
half thousand years later today today we
don&#39;t worship the same gods as people in
the athens did but we worship other
things we don&#39;t gather and discuss
things on the Agora Square but we do
gather and discuss things in different
spaces Facebook Twitter snapchat today
software is eating up the world code is
everything and everything is code the
computational power of machines doubles
every 18 months
change is becoming the only constant and
systems around us are getting hacked
whether that be technical system
political system or human system so the
question is what is our water my name is
Patricia and I have spent quite a bit of
time researching how and why humans get
hacked in ocean as an academic I
research the dark Hawks
of history that is our research what
were the hacks in the history that led
to a downgrade of humanity my research
was focused on the psychological
mechanisms behind genocide hatred
bigotry and violence today is an
entrepreneur I study how humans teams
organizations can hack rewire and
upgrade themselves some people say what
I do is mind hacking and so as any nerdy
hacker I&#39;m fascinated by tech and I
appreciate good code that&#39;s efficient
and well written
now the code and technology I talk about
right now is organic in its nature it
has the ability of wire and we wire
itself as it interacts with the
environment and no it is not the new
super quantum computer it is the
technology of you and me it is the human
technology it&#39;s built out of or emerged
out of 100 billion neurons 100 trillion
synaptic connections 30-month spinal
nerves that carry information the speed
of 40 400 kilometers per hour now this
technology makes us humans a living code
one that wires and we worse itself as we
live learn and evolve now on top of this
wetware we have software we call this
software psychological ways now
psychological OS consists of our
thoughts memories stories that we tell
ourselves and tell others assumptions
biases expectations and this software
runs in the background like any good
software like a software of your
computer or your smartphone because we
all know that the best technology is
seamless and invisible just like
electricity just like water because this
is our water now this is the layer also
when we get hacked or we can hack
ourselves talking about hacking the
world is new but the concept of hacking
has existed and a companion as as
humanity since the dawn of humanity and
it started with tribal elders and tribal
leaders telling stories over bonfire and
those score is later on
spread far and wide as the print was
invented and books got invented and then
those stories got multiplied and
amplified as mass media mass propaganda
got introduced and now those stories
with two billion people connected in a
single app those stories have the
ability to connect us and make us
collaborate or disconnect us by creating
digital echo chambers today
more than half of the world&#39;s
populations is connected by through and
with tech with technology called the
Internet now with such a connectivity
and non-linearity my virus have the
ability of spreading as quickly as a
computer virus and so we will get hacked
pinging beeping buzzing like me heart me
follow me upload me share me buy me we
are getting hot there&#39;s a very famous
book in business innovation field and
has a lovely title change or die now I
would change it for self innovation I
would say it&#39;s hack or be hacked so how
do we do that how do we hack ourselves
well all starts with questions it was
the older finish that was swimming along
and said how&#39;s the water guys and got
the two young fish thinking the socratic
met is actually based on asking
questions
good question has the ability to show us
the nature of reality it has the ability
to show us what is water has the ability
to show us what is our own code a good
question has the ability to help you
hack rewire and upgrade yourself now so
let&#39;s hack something and I thought for
today since we at 10 we might want to
hack the concept of impossible because
why not in order to hack you really need
to understand the deep psychological
wiring of this human OS I want to share
with you a framework we have developed
that has four parts and those are the
four parts of how we as humans get
program how we get hacked
but it&#39;s also the four ways how we can
hack ourselves and it starts with the
head now the head is our cognitive OS
and that means this is where our beliefs
live this is where our assumptions live
this is what the category of possible
and impossible lives what did suck what
socratis did is he will walk around and
he would tell people can you embrace the
opposite can you think that what you
think is impossible is actually possible
and that really is the hack for the head
what would happen if you took the
impossible out of the bucket of
impossible and put it into a possible
what are the thought and cognitive
consequence of thinking that something
that seemed to be impossible is actually
possible and it&#39;s just a thought
experiment but we know that everything
starts in the head and then there&#39;s the
heart this is the symbolic source and
house of human emotions now human
emotions have a very wide spectrum they
go all the way from the dark ones or
so-called dark ones the fear despair
terror anger all the way to the lighter
ones inspiration aww wander and so the
human heart has the ability to hold it
all the question for the heart is what
am I feeling right now and is what am I
feeling leading to breakdowns
breakthroughs or breakdown first and you
would be surprised how many impossible
things got happen from this side of the
human spectrum
how many impossible things got happen
because somebody was frustrated or angry
with the status quo and then we have the
body the body is our hardware we go
where our body goes some psychologists
would say that the body never lies
that the body always keeps the score as
opposed to the head now the question for
the body is what is my body
communicating to me that I need to
acknowledge in order to become the
version of myself that can actually hack
the impossible and then we have people
we have other people this is our social
ecosystem we are hard-wired to be social
other people jaquez other people inspire
us other people teach us
the question is who can I bring into my
tribe who can I bring into my community
that will actually help me hack me and
help me upgrade me now the title of this
talk was hacking humanity the next
revolution with a question mark
I&#39;m actually not going to a question so
and so while hacking Humanity be the
next revolution I don&#39;t know and I don&#39;t
think anybody knows we live an
exponential and nonlinear times for this
human race we&#39;re small change can lead
to a big difference but what I do know
is that it took a couple of brave
courageous and rebellious fish to the
side and say this is water and decide to
go on land and that started a revolution
of evolution for all of us and I like to
end with something called the hackers
manifesto hackers manifested was
published in January in 1986 and it was
the cornerstone of the hacker movement
all over the world written by and
intended for the hacker community the
computer hacking community I think today
it applies to all of us because by the
fact that we human we also all hackers
we have developed to hack rewire and
upgrade ourselves and therefore hacker
wanna upgrade humanity and it says I am
a hacker and this is my manifesto you
may stop this individual but you can
stop us all after all we are alike and
so I think you fellow hackers
