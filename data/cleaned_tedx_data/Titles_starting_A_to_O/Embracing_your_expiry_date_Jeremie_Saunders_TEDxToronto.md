my name is Jimmy Saunders I am 29 years
old and three months from now I will
breathe my very last breath at least
this is what I&#39;ve been told for the
majority of my adult life and this fact
has had the most incredibly profound
effect on my life I live with a chronic
and terminal lung disease called cystic
fibrosis and a very real part in living
with cystic fibrosis is knowing that my
time here on this earth is much more
limited than your average person at only
29 years old I am far too aware that I
only have so many long rich deep breaths
left my lungs currently function at
about the 60% range which isn&#39;t bad you
know I learned back in high school
60% is considered a passing grade so hey
things could be worse but for a moment
just consider what it means when you
apply 60% functionality to your ability
to breathe actually you know what try it
with me altogether take one full breath
in and a full breath out now let&#39;s call
that your ability to breathe that 100%
capacity let&#39;s do it again full breath
in full breath out
feels good doesn&#39;t it let&#39;s take it back
about 50% 50% on your inhale ready
inhale pause exhale fully let&#39;s do 50%
again inhale pause exhale fully let&#39;s
take away another 10%
inhale 40% pause exhale fully
30% in paws full exhale again 30% full
exhale now 20% in paws exhale fully okay
breathe easy so for the last ten years
or so my lungs have been on this very
slow but very steady decline and
statistically speaking it&#39;s due to this
decline in lung function that&#39;s probably
going to Nevitt ibly lead me to my my
death and for most of you who are not
suffering from a fatal lung disease this
isn&#39;t very relatable however what is
very much relatable is that not one
single person in this room has the
ability to escape that one thing that we
all share in common death you are all
going to die everyone you&#39;ve ever known
everyone you&#39;ve ever loved they&#39;re all
going to die your mother is gonna die
your father will die your daughter your
son is gonna die your husband your wife
all of your friends all of them just
like me every single one of you with
every breath that you take you get one
breath closer to taking your very last
breath but this shouldn&#39;t come as a
surprise we all at one point in our
lives come to realize that life is
finite and because your impending demise
is for the most part out of your control
and assumed to be so far off into the
future
that there really is not no need to
dwell upon the matter so in other words
you all accept the fact that you&#39;re
going to die but today
I challenge you to embrace the fact that
you&#39;re all going to die if you met a
genie in a bottle and instead of
offering you three wishes that genie
gave you the opportunity to learn what
your expiry date would be would you take
him up on it
19 years ago I met that genie and he
didn&#39;t give me an opportunity to choose
the year was 1998
on this ten-year-old little goof ball
running through the world and my life
boils down to four very important
priorities frosted flakes for breakfast
lunch and dinner trying to unlock smoke
in Mortal Kombat two trying to convince
my parents to let me stay up late enough
on a Sunday night to watch The X Files
and of course the World Wrestling
Federation what a life
hey well Who am I kidding I mean that
basically sums up my life as it is today
the only difference is when I was 10 I
was blissfully unaware that cystic
fibrosis was actually a fatal disease
back then to me it was just an everyday
nuisance a general pain in my ass but
otherwise life was good until I met that
genie he presented himself to me in the
form of a pamphlet titled all about
cystic fibrosis and in that pamphlet I
came across a sentence and little did I
know that sentence would go on to change
my life in ways that I could never have
imagined the sentence read cystic
fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease now
as a ten-year-old unbeatable MORTAL
KOMBAT god I was fully aware of what the
word fatal meant it was the next portion
of that sentence that offered up that
roundhouse kick straight to the gut the
average life expectancy of someone
living with cystic fibrosis is 30 years
of age
that moment was a life-changer
everything I thought I knew was all of a
sudden flipped upside down my
ten-year-old logic interpreted this new
information by thinking everything I&#39;ve
done in my life I can only do two more
times this moment of realizing that
death is a very real very scary concept
is not uncommon I&#39;m sure that most of
you in this room have been touched by
death in this way maybe it was due to
the the death of a childhood pet or the
the sudden or unexpected death of a
family member or friend or maybe you
yourself have had a close brush in with
death and maybe not maybe you&#39;ve gone
this far in your life without without
having to truly face the inevitability
of it however when we do face that harsh
reality of death we all process that
information in our own way and for me
when I was 10 it was met with fear anger
rejection avoidance it&#39;s so rare that we
process the concept of death willingly
with open arms so when I was thinking
about you know what I wanted to speak to
you all today about I decided to do a
little bit of time travel back to my
younger years how did I feel about this
this concept of living life with a
shorter life expectancy and I&#39;m really
lucky to say that I have a couple of
those cliche proud parents you know the
ones that refuse to throw out any of my
old school work and so I was able to dig
up this gem and it&#39;s it&#39;s an excerpt
from an autobiography that I wrote when
I was 16 years old part for my future
when it comes to thinking about my
future and what I want to do with my
life when it comes to getting married
and having kids I don&#39;t really know what
to think
about 40% of children with cystic
fibrosis live beyond the age of 18 the
average lifespan for those who lived to
adulthood is 30 to 33 if you think about
it what&#39;s the point of getting married
if I&#39;m only going to live for a few
years through that marriage and having a
kid would be pointless unless I want
them to grow up over half their life
without a dad these kinds of things are
hard to think about and it makes me feel
kind of useless now I know what you&#39;re
thinking what a drama queen
right well fast forward to the present
day thirteen years later my perspective
on what it means to live with cystic
fibrosis my perspective on death has
shifted massively it might surprise some
of you to hear this but I can honestly
stand up here today and say that without
a doubt cystic fibrosis is one of the
best things that has ever happened to me
no longer does that sentence cystic
fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease
carry the weight of fear rejection anger
instead it&#39;s become this powerful source
of inspiration it drives me you see my
unavoidable fate opened up my eyes so
wide that it fundamentally changed what
it means to live day in day out moment
to moment
cystic fibrosis has essentially given me
the impetus to not only accept my own
mortality but to embrace my own
mortality and with that comes this
extraordinary sense of freedom and I can
take that freedom and sprinkle it into
my life by living like nothing is
unattainable I can take that big scary
concept of death and instead of fear it
use it as a tool to motivate myself to
live life to the fullest
I honestly think that this piece of
writing played a huge role in that shift
in perspective it was once I was able to
take the words put it on the paper that
I could finally see that yes I
do you accept the fact that I&#39;m going to
die but that acceptance is shrouded in
fear and so right there I had two
choices
let the fear consume me or use it as a
tool to strive the fear of death follows
from the fear of life a man who lives
fully is prepared to die at any time I
just made that up
no I&#39;m kidding it&#39;s a quote from Mark
Twain and I love that quote I love it
let me hit you with it one more time the
fear of death follows from the fear of
life a man who lives fully is prepared
to die at any time I freaking love that
quote because I feel like it almost
perfectly describes the journey that
I&#39;ve been on I am beyond proud to stand
here today and to tell you that by the
age of 29 an age my parents were told I
would never live to see the day I had
accomplished a buttload of amazing
things I was the host of my own
children&#39;s television show on CBC called
art suka aired in 50 countries across
the world and because of my work I want
a Gemini Award and a Canadian Screen
Award I hosted a documentary where I
followed astronaut Chris Hadfield around
the world we went to Russia we went to
Kazakhstan I watched him train for his
mission to command the International
Space Station I got to live out one of
my all-time life dreams I was killed off
in a horror movie sucked up by an alien
it was so badass I went on a three-month
whitewater kayaking expedition living
out of a tent hucking off 40-foot
waterfalls in Mexico something I never
thought I&#39;d have the physical ability to
do I had indeed fallen in love and
gotten married she&#39;s cute
along with my two best friends we
started an internationally-recognized
podcast called sick boy we pull in 1.5
million downloads a year and together we
speak with thousands of people about my
experience in living with cystic
fibrosis and two others who live with
chronic or terminal illness in order to
D stigmatize illness and build community
and support for those who are sick and
somewhere within this crazy fortunate
whirlwind of events I think I attained
my greatest achievement of all at only
18 years old
I was awarded employee of the month at
an adult video store for my ability to
up sell the most lube my mother was
mortified and that is not a joke so how
did I get here right how did I go from
that emotionally distraught teenager to
the young driven successful lube
merchant you see before you today it&#39;s
because I wholeheartedly believed in
that expiry date I&#39;ve lived my life as
if it&#39;s going to end three months from
now I&#39;ve tried to cram in as much life
as I can in my allotted 30 years so that
statistically speaking when I should be
knocking on death&#39;s door regardless of
whether or not I&#39;m actually close to
death I can stand back look at all the
things I&#39;ve done and say I did it
I stopped fearing life and therefore
lived a life with no fear of death I was
the man who lived fully and here&#39;s the
beautiful part about all of this is that
you do not need a diagnosis of a
terminal illness to adopt this view on
life I said it earlier you&#39;re all gonna
die just like me
you all have an expiry date although
yours might just be a little less clear
but what if you didn&#39;t have to be
like that set your expiry date now how
long do you think you have to live 60
years hmm for most of you probably not
how about 50 years 30 years 10 what if
you had 5 years left what if you had 3
months the exciting part about all of
this is that nobody including myself
have any idea of what that number really
is we hear people say it all the time
yeah I could die today
I could walk outside and get hit by a
bus perfect so then how do you want to
live in those moments between right now
and the face of that bus do you want to
live those moments with a little more
compassion more courage more
vulnerability more love how about a
little more laughter my name is Jeremy
Saunders and three months from now when
I hit 30 after I&#39;ve squeezed out as much
life as I can after I take my very last
breath everything from that moment
forward is Bonus Time
so how about you start your clock today
and ask yourself how do you want to
finish your life thank you
