I remember in German language class when
I was 13 a teacher made a real point of
focusing on vocabulary maybe you&#39;ve had
a similar experience
one day in explaining the importance of
repetition she taught us use a word ten
times and it shall be yours for life it
was then I heard my friend Simon behind
me and clasped elbows rooted into the
table chanting Sara Sara Sara Sara Sara
I&#39;m sorry to tell you Sara didn&#39;t fall
lovingly into Simon&#39;s arms that day it
seems the repeat and you shall keep raw
didn&#39;t work for Simon it doesn&#39;t work
for love and it definitely doesn&#39;t work
for language T I&#39;m an English language
teacher I&#39;ve worked for many years with
children from around the world to
develop their English skills and today I
hope to show you a few experiences I&#39;ve
had along the way and particularly would
like to convince you of the importance
of our home languages oh think back to
when you were 13 years old you&#39;re sat in
a classroom facing the front and the
teacher writes on the board
big Annamma tree your face drops you
know I&#39;ve never fully understood
trigonometry even now actually more than
that I&#39;ve never quite trusted those who
do I don&#39;t know perhaps my brains not
wired in that way either way
trigonometry is a subject the teacher
tries to work the class through every
detailed measurement of a triangle not
an easy test to teach
never mind learn now imagine this is
what you were given this is an expert
of trigonometry in Bosnian I&#39;m not going
to read it or attempt I don&#39;t want to
look like a fool here today but the
point is how much more difficult is this
when we don&#39;t have the language see our
home languages our mother tongues are an
essential part of our thinking minds and
identities they represent who we are and
they&#39;re also the bedrock of all our
learning be that maths science or
English our home languages are so so
important
even when we&#39;re learning through second
language but do we as parents and
educators pay enough attention to the
home language of the children we support
I&#39;d argue maybe not now it may surprise
you to know that most children around
the world attend schools which teach in
a different language without which they
use at home now this may sound
impossible but think about it how many
languages exist China for example and
we&#39;re not just talking accents here but
whole spoken languages we have Cantonese
in Guangdong for example and there are
many other examples from around the
world but what&#39;s important is it&#39;s not
uncommon for children to go and learn in
one language and go home and speak an
entirely different language with their
family state education is delivered in
Mandarin yet many children will speak a
different dialect at home now added to
these types of schools is another type
of school which has seen incredible
growth in the last ten years the
International School this has been
particularly true in China
how many international schools do you
know in Guangzhou there&#39;s a new one open
interest down the road from here and of
course were all gathered today in an
international school study Sid
but the number one reason for parents
choosing international schools is so
that their children can learn English
and this makes sense in our ever
globalized world English has become the
lingua franca the common language of
government business and communities now
naturally in pursuit of English parents
are willing to go to great lengths to
ensure success for their children in
line with the rise of international
schools we also see an explosion of
English academies in our city
now these at one point used to serve a
mainly adult population usually for
business English yet now they&#39;re open
every evening and every weekend and
serve more and more children it&#39;s not
uncommon for a child to go to an
international school where they speak in
English read in English write in English
all day then go straight after school
through an Academy to learn yet more
English this is unnecessary
not only that or potentially damaging to
our children&#39;s language learning
journeys and worse still damaging to
their social and emotional well-being
let me tell you a story a few years ago
I worked with a young boy Joe a lovely
little guy from Korea about 6 years old
now he&#39;d moved China with his family for
their work as many do and so he signed
up to the English International School
where I was teaching now first Joe was
doing great he always had a big smile on
his face ear to ear quiet yes he was
making friends ok yet soon teachers
to worry dough was making very little
progress with his English he would only
speak in very simple phrases but to be
honest he he stays silent most of the
time oh we got his parents in to find
out a little bit more and when they came
in we were stumped he were his parents
the kind of parents every teacher wants
super supportive in anticipation of him
starting at the International School
they bought those of English books to
read with him they subscribed on the TV
to some English TV channels for him and
they even signed him up at a local
Academy those same before with all this
support surely you would have expected
his English to improve it wasn&#39;t then we
asked a question now chose Korean
answered well okay but we&#39;re trying to
focus on English now how about reading
do you read with Jo in Korean well no
but every day in English well that&#39;s
good it&#39;s good that they read English
books with him how about TV any Korean
TV no just English now yes just Jo study
any Korean they said well no he&#39;s in an
English school just studies English you
where this is going we ask the parents
to try something for the next few months
bring Korean back those life read with
him Korean watch TV in Korean and talk
about what Joe&#39;s been doing at school
not in English but in Korean and then
we&#39;ll meet again before we wanted to
move on to see if there was any
underlying learning needs we wanted to
try this first and
did and one month later Joe was speaking
more English reading more English
writing more English and his skills in
other subjects were on the up why did
this work because the different
languages we learn don&#39;t exist in
isolated parts of the brain scientists
are increasingly coming to understand
that actually there is no single
language component in the brain at all
and that we use many parts of the brain
to store and produce language Jim
Cummings a Canadian professor gave this
analogy which I find rather useful this
is the dual iceberg model here you can
see two ice boats two tips of the
icebergs and these represent the surface
features of our languages how they sound
how they look the things that make them
different so you can see here we&#39;ve got
two tips that represents a bilingual
learner if there were three tips you&#39;ll
be trilingual if there were four tips
you&#39;d be showing off but what&#39;s
important is that if we look underneath
the icebergs we would see that they&#39;re
connected and this connecting section is
what Jim Cummins labels the common
underlying proficiency and this is
important as it means if we learn a
concept in one language we don&#39;t have to
relearn that concept again when speaking
another language we just need to learn
the language bribe it if you learn how
to do trigonometry in Chinese you don&#39;t
have to relearn how to do trigonometry
again when learning English you just
need the language to describe it all I
may even have to do as a teacher is
display the concept in your mother
tongue or pictorially and if you already
know the concept you can connect the
dots
the father of modern linguistics Noam
Chomsky who celebrates his 88th birthday
this year once said within one mother
tongue are all mother tongues but
another way our brains are actually
hardwired for language there may not be
hardwired for trigonometry but they are
for language language is innate how we
think and the thousands of languages
that exist on this planet all follow
certain principles all know languages
have nouns for example words that
describe things and all known languages
have verbs words that describe actions
in fact all known languages probably
also have swear words which describe
people we don&#39;t like but what&#39;s
important is that our brains are
hard-wired for this language now a few
months ago I was sat in the staff room
having a coffee with a geography teacher
I know who would choose in their break
to sit with a geography teacher but I
did while having a coffee he told me of
a project he was doing with his year
nines that&#39;s about 13 14 years old in
the project he asked them his class to
make a presentation on the formation of
natural disasters but three girls in his
class were from Thailand and spoke
limited English between them now alarm
bells started ringing in my head at this
point I&#39;ve seen it before where children
with limited English are thrown into
project work and struggle to get the
concepts the whole way through imagine
you had to make a presentation on the
formation of earthquakes and through
healy for example we probably couldn&#39;t
even engage with the reading we had to
do
never mind discuss on conclusions or
present
so we try to take a slightly different
approach for these girls the teacher
said to them you can do this whole
project in Thai you can plan in Thai use
the Internet talk with family do
everything in your research in Thai but
when it comes to the end of the project
I&#39;d like you to translate your findings
into English then to the class was of
this the girls engaged deeply with the
content in front of them they
passionately researched their
presentation into the formation of
volcanoes using family and friends for
advice reading texts they could
understand and then at the end as agreed
they translated their findings into
English and presented to the class now
of course they needed a little extra
time for this and that was rightly given
but it also resulted in them receiving
the highest grades in the class now I&#39;m
not one to say that grades are the sum
total of education but think about that
for a second the highest grades in the
class from these girls and that could
have ended so differently as I said if
they&#39;d have had to plan in English could
they have confidently researched learned
and presented on the complexities of
volcanoes perhaps not and the teacher
would have assumed that they simply
didn&#39;t have the ability or worse still
the girls could have assumed the same
the damaging message - by supporting the
home language of the children we learn
and embracing it we can actively
encourage positive outcomes for them
food in educational social and emotional
and we as parents teachers are
responsible for making sure this happens
you know the conversation we&#39;re having
today is actually already been had in
the little detail and not too far from
here
when Hong Kong was returned to China in
97 the government had some decisions to
make about language the years British
English was the language of a lot of
government and education yet most
children went home he Cantonese with
their family often who couldn&#39;t
understand English themselves and this
was given as one of the reasons why
educational standards were not as high
as would have been liked as a result of
this policies were put in place to
ensure that children didn&#39;t fall behind
and one of these policies was a renewed
emphasis on Cantonese the home language
of the majority of Hong Kong is it was
reported as a result that this led and
led to better student results oh if we
can agree then that nurturing first
languages is good for the students or
how do we go about nurturing I propose
three steps that we both parents and
educators can use to support our
children with their home languages
review read relax review parents this
one is key what do you do at home to
support the content of your child&#39;s
learning the maths science inquiry
simple thing you can do is ask your
child what did you do at school today
you know this is a common conversation
in the homes of monolingual children but
can be absent from homes of bilingual
children perhaps the parents
subconsciously detach from the language
school because it&#39;s different to their
own but you don&#39;t need to speak schools
language to talk to your child about
what they&#39;ve done at school do it in
your mother tongue that way their
academic language can develop I&#39;ll ingre
lee an equally
teachers what opportunities can you make
to bring the home language into your
classroom is there ways that you can
share with parents what the children
have been doing in school so that they
can take their learning home secondly
Reid and I should add right to that
again
parents read with your children in their
mother tongue we learn so much through
what we read and why restrict that just
English equally teachers other
opportunities you can use for reading in
home language in your classroom
and of course writing as I mentioned
before you know there&#39;s so many things
we can do for writing in their home
language at home for example why not
write letters to friends and family
stories be creative it can be great fun
and certainly might not be something
they&#39;re doing at school and finally
relax you know learning a second
language is hard and it can be stressful
what do you do and what pressure do you
put on the children to pour the number
one barrier to learning anything breath
if we can take off the pressure just a
little and yes that may include not
taking on that extra tutor that may
include setting slightly less homework
and that may include taking a lighter
approach to testing then we can give our
children the space they deserve hello
review read relax
I hope the
if this message is made clear in the
very labeling by home languages think
about it home language home place we&#39;re
safe the place we return to everyday the
place we think the place we feel base we
love and mother tongue mother the very
symbol of our safety our grounding and
our birth you know I live away from my
birth home I&#39;m from England but I live
in China yeah I returned home every year
and where my mother and father are will
always be a home to me they&#39;re my
grounding and have laid the foundations
for everything I have and everything I
am today regardless of how many
languages were lucky enough to learn our
mother tongues our home languages are
the foundations on which everything else
we learn built thank you
