good evening so the origins of my
torture like go back a number of years -
and I was seen down to watch the nightly
news and two news stories came on a bell
Iraq now the first news story was about
the Iraqi recruiting centers and
apparently enthusiasm was so great for
joining the new Iraqi army that the line
went out the door down the street and
around the corner so much so that the
insurgents had started a campaign of car
bombing to try to stem the tide of
enthusiasm for joining the new Iraqi
army the second news story was about the
performance of the new rocky army Mosul
and it wasn&#39;t very flattering so what
happened was that they were deployed
down to Mosul and these new Iraqi units
deserted along the way so the Sunni and
Shia and Kurds they were deployed
together down to Mosul and they decided
along the road why am i fighting with
these guys against my co ethnics and
they these new units began to
disintegrate so this got me thinking
about armies and the model of army that
were trying to impose on these countries
now this is really important it&#39;s
important for the host countries
themselves because security is the
concrete foundation upon which
everything else is built whether you&#39;re
talking about electricity and plumbing
or the rule of law and good governance
none of that can be built if there&#39;s car
bombs going off in the street i ADIZ and
there&#39;s ambushes on every second corner
it&#39;s also important for the United
States the United States has the most
powerful military in human history and
if they can&#39;t win they can&#39;t win an in
Vietnam they can&#39;t win in Afghanistan
they can&#39;t win you know Iraq and the
problem is is that they can&#39;t rebuild
these militaries in these
trees passing the baton of security onto
a reliable and effective host nation
military is the exit strategy it&#39;s how
you win and if they don&#39;t seem to be out
do this very well at the moment so I
started thinking more broadly about
armies and when you think about armies
you probably conjure up the image of
these mixed national armies it doesn&#39;t
matter about your ethnicity your race
your religion whether you came from the
South lost north or the east or the west
we could all get climb on the bus
together and you all become Marines or
you all become soldiers you&#39;re mixed up
in this National Army but this model is
really recent and it&#39;s quite odd think
back over 60,000 years of human history
back when we first have evidence of
people gathering together to fight other
people you&#39;ll be fighting in your tribe
you&#39;ve been fighting amongst your
brother your cousin your father
fast-forward again to the Middle Ages
and you might have all watched that Mel
Gibson movie Braveheart where you got
the villager on the field of battle and
he says I&#39;m not gonna fight for died for
these bastards and for the whole army
starts to disintegrate that villager is
talking to people he&#39;s known his entire
life next door neighbors cousins
brothers again and that army was either
all going to stay on that field of
battle or is all gone berserk as one you
can&#39;t desert on your next-door neighbor
how do you look their mother in the face
fast-forward again to the first world
war and local recruitment was still the
model that most armies was build upon
the slogan was that you would join
together you train together you button
together and you would fight together
the pre-existing social bonds was going
to be the glue that was going to hold
these units together so they wouldn&#39;t
just run away without a fight for as a
band of brothers together but you could
add to this propaganda picture however
was you or die together the first world
war changed everything it changed things
for two reasons the first was that the
weapons of
had gotten to a point where entire units
could be wiped out in seconds imagine
what would happen if an artillery shell
was to fall upon this trench line all
the sons of one town creep wiped out in
seconds and you see this as you travel
around small towns around the country
you have two small towns that would seem
similar in every way except that one has
a woman Morel with a lot of names and
the next town has relative a few names
why because unfortunately one group of
soldiers had artillery show for them or
that they were sent to attack a
particularly toughness trench line
whereas the next town long may have got
off fairly lightly the other thing that
World War two changed was nationalism
that governments learnt that they could
beat the drum that they could wave the
flag and young men would rally to the
cause so they no longer needed to
recruit locally in order to attract
soldiers and have them stick together so
when we think about armies we think
about these new armies this this
national army of them all being mixed
together but yet this is a model that
we&#39;re trying to impose on these
countries and it&#39;s just not working one
nationalism hasn&#39;t risen to the point
where people&#39;s primary loyalty is to the
country rather than to their local
neighborhood the second is that often
the conflict in these countries isn&#39;t
going to be the type that&#39;s going to
wipe out entire units all in one go it&#39;s
often insurgency and guerrilla warfare
rather than the mass slaughter that we
saw in the first world war
so this first approach may not be work
it isn&#39;t working and it may not be
appropriate for these countries that
we&#39;re trying to build new armies in a
second approach though would be to just
group all the co ethnics together so you
go to Iraq and you build an army based
upon a Kurdish army a sunni army and
ashiya army now this isn&#39;t going to work
either because you&#39;re building
ready-made ethnic militias for when you
depart so that second model is probably
inappropriate as well so what my
research is currently looking at is a
third way something between these two
extremes imagine an army where the unit
that you wake up with or from the local
neighborhood the unit that you eat with
that you trained with that you pray with
that you fight with or Co ethnics from
the same background and the same
community that you come from the glue is
already pre-existing in the unit yet
within the macro unit you&#39;re mixed up so
perhaps you could imagine an institution
where at the company level or the
battalion level you&#39;re all her ethnics
and your will being locally recruited
but yet at the gate and regimental level
you&#39;re all mixed up so institutionally
you can&#39;t link in with other co efflux
to form a ethnic militia when the
international forces go home so this
institutional approach isn&#39;t going to be
a super board so soldiers were still
desert if you don&#39;t pay them soldiers
were still desert if their officers are
hopeless but the model that we&#39;ve been
applying in South Vietnam Afghanistan
Iraq clearly isn&#39;t working and as we
look forward to look forward but look
for look in the future to future
operations in Syria in Yemen impossible
in Libya then we need to approach this
with a new institutional model so Wars
aren&#39;t won these days through breaking
things wars are won these days through
fixing them and the sooner that our
armies can learn to fix foreign
militaries in a different way to the way
that we do them the better it&#39;s going to
be for everybody thank you
you
