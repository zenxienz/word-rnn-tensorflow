so I still remember the exact spot on
the highway where I was driving I think
I remember it so vividly because I was
having one of the most important
conversations that I&#39;ve ever had with
myself in that moment in my car I knew
in my bones I wouldn&#39;t drink alcohol
again so you might be thinking what was
the rock bottom that brought me to that
point and the answer is there wasn&#39;t one
you see I was a gray area drinker and I
drank between two extremes I wasn&#39;t an
end-stage lose everything kind of
drinker not by a long shot if you would
have asked my friends and family if they
thought I had a drinking problem they
would have said of course not but I also
wasn&#39;t in every now and again drinker
who would have a glass of champagne for
example at a wedding and then not
drinking in four weeks I didn&#39;t fall
into either one of those drinking
categories or drinking extremes and
maybe you can identify as a nutritionist
who has worked in corporate wellness
since 2004 I functioned really well I
knew how to eat well I worked out on a
regular basis I loved to read and study
everything health and wellness but what
people didn&#39;t know was how much I loved
the off switch
that wine provided to my on and often
anxious brain
I loved the immediate effect that red
wine delivered and people also didn&#39;t
see how easy and frequent it was for one
glass of wine to turn into one bottle of
wine there&#39;s a common characteristic and
pattern in gray area drinking that I
experienced and I&#39;ve watched many others
experience as well and that&#39;s a stopping
and restarting drinking one time I
stopped for seven months
another time I stopped for thirty days
and other short periods in between and
then I would think to myself why am i
being serviced
I could be a social drinker so I&#39;d
return to drinking only to return to a
level of drinking and I regret it this
back and forth drinking merry-go-round
was the exact thing that I knew I wanted
to exit off of for good that day in my
car on the highway and maybe you
actually don&#39;t identify with gray area
drinking because not everyone will but
here&#39;s what I know with absolute
certainty there are people in your life
right now could be family members close
friends colleagues and they&#39;re worrying
and wondering as they&#39;re rethinking
their drinking because they are in the
gray area but more than likely they&#39;re
not talking to you about it and they&#39;re
not talking to others about it because
they think they&#39;re the only ones and
they keep there alone so how do I know
this I lived this for many years and the
more I&#39;ve been speaking out
professionally about my gray area
drinking experience the more my email
inbox is flooded with emails from
attorneys therapist senior level
managers and nurses stay-at-home moms
yoga instructors and many many others
and their words are different but the
gist of what they write to me is all the
same and they say I identify with your
drinking story I don&#39;t have a rock
bottom either I want to be able to drink
socially but I end up regretting how
much I drink on a frequent basis this
gray area drinking spectrum it&#39;s real
it&#39;s large and there are a lot of high
achieving high functioning people who
silently live here every day
but beyond gray area drinking that&#39;s
even something bigger and that&#39;s a
collective story of anxiety mists I
believe is where we are collectively
missing the mark we don&#39;t need anymore
cognitive hoops to jump through and we
don&#39;t need anymore ways to focus our
willpower and contort our willpower in a
to fix ourselves what we need is
practical training in how to nourish our
nervous system in a revolutionary and
new way so there&#39;s many components and
pieces to this but one component and one
interesting place to start can be
understanding your neural transmitters
so let&#39;s start with gaba so GABA is the
natural anti-anxiety neurotransmitter
and when gaba
is low we can feel anxious and our mind
can get stuck in a loop of worry
rumination or obsession about anything
serotonin is the natural antidepressant
neurotransmitter when serotonin is low
we can feel more depressed unhappy and
crave things like carbs and alcohol and
have trouble sleeping dopamine is the
neurotransmitter that&#39;s in charge of our
focus and motivation when dopamine&#39;s low
it can be hard to stay the course and
stay on track with your goals and your
routines so people with low GABA will
often say they drink as a way to relax
that was me people with low serotonin
will say they drink is a way to have fun
and people with low dopamine will say
they drink is a way to connect and
engage with others here&#39;s the problem if
here&#39;s what I want you to know and take
them this hot it can be relatively easy
for most people on the gray area
drinking spectrum to stop drinking but
it can be hard to stay stopped
especially if we&#39;re not replenishing our
neurotransmitters and nourishing our
nervous system in a comprehensive and
consistent way so here&#39;s the good news
it turns out there&#39;s actually specific
foods movements and lifestyle practices
that while they&#39;re great wellness tips
for everyone
they have very direct and immediate
roles in boosting all of our
neurotransmitters
so as a way to give you some practical
ways that you can begin to boost your
neurotransmitters now I&#39;d like to start
by doing that by using the acronym
nourish so n notice nature research
shows that when our pleasure which is
built Amin and our happiness which is
serotonin both begin to rise when we go
into areas with a large density of trees
or a large body of water like an ocean
all it takes is 20 minutes of being
around nature with a lot of trees a lot
of water for your gaba serotonin and
dopamine to begin to rise observe your
breath there are many medications that
can stunt blunts and block the fight
flight freeze response in your body
there are no medications that can boost
the commerce pots but there&#39;s one
mechanism in your body that can do that
naturally and that mechanism is your
breath when our breath is regulated our
neurotransmitters become regulated take
a breath
none of that yeah you all just gave a
little boost to your gaba serotonin
dopamine uniting with others their
research is solid close social bonds
community and social connections have a
direct impact on our nervous system in
our technology driven world we&#39;ve become
very deficient of human touch hug the
people who support you have your pets
give bodywork massage or Reiki it
doesn&#39;t matter whatever resonates with
you
physical touch has an immediate impact
on boosting gaba serotonin and dopamine
replenish with food when you eat protein
whether it&#39;s animal protein or vegetable
protein it doesn&#39;t matter it breaks down
into amino acids and amino acids are
what we&#39;re klemish gaba serotonin and
dopamine when you eat healthy fats
particularly in the form of omega-3 fats
like fish oil flax seeds or walnuts
those omega-3 fats are the raw materials
that make your neurotransmitters when
you eat carbohydrates specifically in
the ideal form of vegetables and even
more specifically fiy green vegetables
they break down into B vitamins and B
vitamins are the precursors that make
serotonin when you replenish with food
you replenish your neurotransmitters I
initiate movement any exercise will
boost neurotransmitters but Boston
University did a study with yoga
participants and they had them do a
60-minute yoga class and then when they
measured their GABA after that class
they found everyone&#39;s GABA went up at
least 27% some participants how to
arrive and gather up to 80 percent
compared to a control group that read a
book for 60 minutes there was no change
in their GABA 160 minute yoga class can
initiate a boost in all your
neurotransmitters but after we&#39;re active
we need to be still sitting in stillness
allows the nervous system the
opportunity to respond and adapt in our
complex world that we live and work in
in a very nourishing way and
particularly sitting in stillness inside
invoking a sacred prayer meditation or
scripture can really feed and replenish
your gaba serotonin and dopamine H
harness your creativity dopamine loves
the creative flow and the way you get
into a creative flow is to pick a single
focused activity that ends in IMG some
examples are gardening fishing painting
but be careful because there&#39;s some
other activities that end in ing that
make us feel like we get a dopamine hit
drinking smoking overeating fishing
painting that positive hobbies boost
your dopamine the other drinking smoking
overeating depletes dopamine harness
your creativity but be very
conscientious how you&#39;re doing that as
of today it&#39;s been 1054 days since I&#39;ve
had a drink of alcohol
but I didn&#39;t have a rock-bottom moment
that brought me to this point and you
don&#39;t need to have one either from the
outside looking in my drinking did not
look problematic but from the inside
looking out at the road I was traveling
down I knew the way I was drinking was a
problem for me I&#39;m not the only one
making this decision there are thousands
of people in this country in the UK
Australia and Canada who are rethinking
their drinking and stopping drinking
because they choose to not because they
have to a whole paradigm is shifting and
we&#39;re upon a whole new wellness movement
it&#39;s starting to go alcohol-free but
I&#39;ll be honest there were two things I
worried about when I stopped drinking
and the first was what would happen with
my relationships this one surprised me
the important relationships in my life
not only stuck by me but they deepened
and I look back at all the new and
wonderful people who have entered my
life in the last three years some of the
drinks some of them don&#39;t but our
relationship is not built on my personal
decision to not drink we&#39;ve been able to
connect and relate and were aligned in a
way that is new for me and it&#39;s been
really really nourishing to have these
relationships to my life the second
thing that I worried about was what if
something awful happens and it&#39;ll be so
painful then I&#39;ll want to numb it with a
glass or a bottle of wine that word came
true
18 months into not drinking I hit my
worst personal financial crisis of my
life if there was ever a time that I
wanted to numb the experience and
anesthetize the intense anxiety and fear
that I felt that was the time but I
didn&#39;t do it and I believe the reason I
got through that time without drinking
wasn&#39;t because I had an intellectual
understanding of the nervous system
which I do but intellectualizing
something isn&#39;t what gets me through
something and it wasn&#39;t because I have
strong willpower which I don&#39;t my
willpower fatigues as much as the next
person
but what I had was very targeted and
specific nourishment that I&#39;d given my
nervous system leading up to that point
in a very new and different way and that
had given me a zone of resilience an
internal zone of resilience that I never
had the whole so whatever road you&#39;re on
wherever you are on that road with your
own internal conversation whether you&#39;re
a health care practitioner like myself a
business professional in any industry a
stay-at-home parent or anyone else if
you know in your bones that you&#39;re in
the gray area with drinking or anything
else as an attempt to regulate the
anxiety in your body or the discomfort
in your life don&#39;t forget you&#39;re GABA
your serotonin and your dopamine on
waiting for you to activate them with
certain foods movements and lifestyle
practices and when you do that you&#39;re
giving your nervous system the
nourishment it&#39;s been craving
