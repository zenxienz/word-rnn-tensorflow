my first love affair with stories began
with gossip from my mother so I would
listen to her and her friends gossip and
my mother rest her soul loved gossip
funny as hell to you but then you get to
a certain age where you spats
understanding the stories that they&#39;re
talking about and then one day you laugh
a little too loud and they realize that
oh this one can understand the jokes now
and I&#39;m the spender story so the next
time someone tries to say something sips
so so then they stop talking and then
you don&#39;t have your source of stories
anymore and that&#39;s when I moved on to
reading but my first reading material
when I was about seven eight years old
was with the newspapers that my father&#39;s
continues to buy religiously to this day
and then that got boring because
newspapers are the same thing it&#39;s the
same used as different people tomorrow
just someone filling space everyday got
boring and somehow from some way I got a
hold of books I don&#39;t know where they
came from but I&#39;m grateful that I found
them because it was in those books that
I finally lent of the joy of getting
yourself lost in a story of having your
soul held ransom by a story you know
when you&#39;re reading a good book and the
last pages you don&#39;t want it to end
because you don&#39;t want the people to go
you don&#39;t want to lose them but you do
and that that&#39;s what I found in books
and so I read anything and everything I
could lay my hands on when I was in high
school I spent my free time I went to
boarding school in the Catholic school
all girls don&#39;t do that to your children
I went to boarding school and during our
free time what I would do is I would
write stories in notebooks I don&#39;t know
if anyone remembers those two choir
notebooks that we used to write it in
highs at school back when I was a school
and who didn&#39;t have tablets and and I
would write stories in there and then I
would have the books go out and loan to
the students much like one who do take a
book out alone in the library and I
think that&#39;s when I knew that my life
and my world would comprise of words and
stories
and I took made a resolution right they
in there I was going to work with words
with stories all my life that was the
carrier I was going to do but with the
little information I had available to me
at that time it seemed to me that the
only way in to that world was through
journalism and so I was gonna study
journalism but things didn&#39;t go quite as
planned finish my trick
I had a big bursary sponsor they say
listen anywhere you want to go all you
have to do study engineering and I loved
maths awesome I can do this wrong
spectacular fail I studied engineering
for four years and by the end of it I
was depressed and a shadow of the
brilliant student that I have always
known myself to be but it is also at
that time that I remembered my passion
with stories and I wanted to get back to
it
but I still thought journalism so off I
went to the University of Pretoria to
apply for journalism and I get there the
night sorry sweetie too late
fool so I&#39;m sitting there thinking this
dream it&#39;s just never gonna happen
and a career counsellor took me aside
and said to me well there&#39;s a thing
called publishing that you could do and
then she started to explain to me what
publishing was and at some point I
stopped listening because that woman had
said to me you could work in a place
where you make books and I thought what
you can make books in South Africa
because I had never seen a book written
by a local person up to that time so I
thought so books are not an overseas
thing you know because I always thought
they had to come from all the season to
get to us and so I&#39;m like okay let&#39;s do
this thing and then I studied I started
studying and it wasn&#39;t quite as dreamy
as I&#39;d imagined it to be because I was
chasing a dream alongside people who
knew more than I did
who had exposed to more than what I had
been exposed to so where I as a child
had to find my own
material they had grown up in
environments that enabled them to read
and they always had the right reading
material so when someone said to me
so the Diary of a Wimpy Kid I did a
blink and someone said sweet very high
and I did a double blink because I
didn&#39;t know whether I was reading Mills
and Boon I was far ahead I didn&#39;t know
what those were and because I love
stories so much
another performative stories that I love
is television and I can sit and watch TV
for days which is why I do not have TV
at my house now because I would never
get anywhere done but when I was still
very liberal with my TV watching I
remember the movie Matilda that came out
in 1996 that had tentatively turn it and
you know Danny DeVito another class nice
Rose who always like a little scoundrel
like a little devilish guy you know and
he&#39;s arguing his characters arguing in
the movie with his daughter the
daughters questioning their the ethics
of his work and he turns around because
you know and I&#39;d also defeated their
going to big defense mode and he says to
the doctor to the daughter I&#39;m smart
you&#39;re dumb I&#39;m big you&#39;re little so
shut up you cannot say anything further
and we&#39;re not studying publishing that
is what I began to felt like the world
was saying to me I felt like everything
around me was telling me that you can&#39;t
have an opinion because you don&#39;t know
enough you can&#39;t say anything you can&#39;t
raise your hand up in class because what
if you pronounce that guy&#39;s name wrong
but I cut up because school is a much
better environment because often if you
like he like ours and you have nurturing
lecturers like I did it gets better
and it did get better and I finished
studying but nothing and I mean nothing
could have prepared me for the working
industry that is the South African
publishing industry I arrived full of
life I&#39;m gonna do this
books yay and I arrived and I&#39;m like
whoa
so all publishers are white not just
white but they&#39;re also old
and reluctant to retire the Lord won&#39;t
call them it&#39;s a Miss the bookstore&#39;s
our white-owned the book reviewers are
white the writers are almost all white
and the readers are white and um and you
know we have book launches as book
people and you get to these launches and
it&#39;s like all white I have to tell my
friends because then my friends would
start coming to book launches and I&#39;d
say to the single ones you&#39;re not
finding a man this is not that kind of
party you&#39;re not going to find a black
man here at this book launches and so
you sit there and you think I don&#39;t know
I mean I can say these names now but
back then I didn&#39;t know I didn&#39;t know
them like I didn&#39;t know who TN Mayor was
I had never heard of him but he was like
the biggest selling thing in South
Africa in terms of books so you&#39;re
sitting at book launches and in between
sips of wine and our womb I&#39;m not
judging anyone for the one because you
need one in this industry I need wine
and in between sips of wine there&#39;s the
infamous phrase that is a favorite in
South Africa that says blacks do not
read but you look around you like what
would they read but I realized that you
know I&#39;m again in this in the center of
this world way the walls seem to be
closing in on me my little friend Danny
DeVito comes back I&#39;m big you&#39;re small
I&#39;m smart you&#39;re done and I do feel it
because you sit in editorial meetings
where we talk commissioning and we talk
up I would identify the gaps that need
to be filled and almost every every name
that comes up is an is a White&#39;s name
you know so you sit there and you feel
inadequate because you don&#39;t know these
people and the people that you want to
suggest no one knows them soon but I
stood there and I realized the one thing
I now know about life is that when you
surrender yourself to a situation
it allows you to come back to a place of
Commerce that allows you to adapt to
think and to act and the one thing that
Toni Morrison said was that if there&#39;s a
book you want to read and you can&#39;t find
it write it and I thought well if there
is a younger me some way trying to find
books
what would they find and what I started
to do and people ask me all the time is
how do you choose the books that you&#39;re
going to publish and I say to them all
the time that publishing is a very
subjective filled and this is why the
output from the white publishing
industry is so white because people
publish what there is a need with so I
said by all means by all account if we
fail listen great but I am going to
publish the stories that I know because
when you&#39;re a parish you need to be able
to direct a story so how do you direct a
story if you don&#39;t understand the
context you know because and I have but
in the beginning of my career and I used
to have fights with editors because they
would want to change things so if
someone said and then the teacher beats
us with a duster in school they said
surely that can&#39;t have happened but it
did
and if someone says in dialogue in a
book my mother asked me to go borrow
fish oil from next door honey it is not
cooking oil it is fish oil
the managers call it cooking oil you&#39;ve
distorted the context you&#39;ve taken
completely remove the story so as a
black publisher coming up on me young
and I&#39;m coming up against this was and
they keep saying old TV so that&#39;s not
how you do it though and I said but
that&#39;s how we said it though so it it
becomes a tussle but I wake up one day
and I look back at my work and I
realized that having stayed in my
smallness having accepted it had
resulted in a body of work of voices and
of stories that would never have seen
the light of day so I&#39;m not the only
person that realizes this so suddenly
people are like hey you smart like I
know this and and so then I get offered
the opportunity to head up a publishing
imprint which is called Blackbird books
which started in 2015 and operates as a
platform for new fresh black voices and
black narratives and I&#39;m going to place
if you like so if I&#39;m so you really if
I&#39;m a white person and I&#39;m writing a
black story sweetie you shouldn&#39;t be
doing that so I don&#39;t I&#39;m unapologetic
and it took a while for me to come to be
as unapologetic about it as I am and so
you would think and the point that I
made now I&#39;m big no longer feeling small
accept the world doesn&#39;t work that way
when you&#39;re a black woman everything
remains a fight you know people always
want to undermine you and to catch you I
remember a man who looks like Danny
DeVito but he is a real person he&#39;s
alive he published he operates in the
publishing industry flipped through one
of my books once and said oh this is
rubbish
and I thought wow okay and it took me
such a long time to actually realize
that I can&#39;t publish for everyone what
one of the first female black female
writers in this country made I&#39;m glad
you said that if I write something and
you find that you did not like it it&#39;s
okay it&#39;s not for you because and it&#39;s a
difficult thing when you still operate
and work in a world where the people you
are publishing for and walking to the
book shops because the book shops are
placed in certain places so the access
is a problem and I keep telling people
if you other people don&#39;t want to spend
money because you have never seen an
advert for tape away you&#39;ve never you
don&#39;t know what their jingle is you
don&#39;t know what their slogan is and it
is an every single household in the
township but it is because it is people
being sold to in the way that they want
to consume but if you&#39;re a little old me
small damn in the publishing industry
with old people it&#39;s very difficult to
affect that kind of change but it
doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t affect any
change at all so what I know now about
my life about my work is that I can
affect change from where I am from my
smallness even though I may still appear
dumb to some I can still have the most
impactful work because when you return
to a place of truth of knowing who you
are it really does not matter who says
what about you because then you&#39;re
putting out authentic work impactful
work and work that changes lives
so I remain small to some people in this
industry and it was never as apparent as
when Blackbird books turn to two years
in August and one of the books that came
out caused a huge backlash and I had
everyone and I mean everyone going in
and I was like some of you have just
been waiting though you know because I
woman you not allowed failure or
mistakes you know your failure and your
mistakes
I carry a threatening not for anyone
else but yours I carry a threatening and
I looked at my career being threatened
and I could not believe it that after
every every single book that I&#39;ve
published that only one book was enough
to dismiss me okay and now I have to get
that I have to get back to Who I am to
my intention to my purpose and carry on
doing the work that I want to do and I
may be small I may be dumb but I can
mention my name in the same sentence and
20 Morrison now so I owe my growth my
being to the structures and the systems
that told me I&#39;m big you&#39;re small I&#39;m
smart you&#39;re done
