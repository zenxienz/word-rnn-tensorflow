that was a that was an amazing intro
thank you and it&#39;s a delight to be here
so thank you very much
as Sara said I work at virgin Management
which is the central part of the Virgin
Group and I joined virgin about 10 years
ago actually originally joined Virgin
Mobile which was part of Virgin Media
and I was one of their HR business
partners and then six years ago I moved
into virgin Management in a kind of a
version of the job that I do now I have
a very long job title and actually I
almost was going to start by making some
trying to make some funny gag about my
name and obviously the thing with
bridges but I failed miserably but at
least I&#39;ve kind of liked it so when I
moved so as Sarah said my role is to
work with all of the Virgin Group
companies globally and just very quickly
sorry if it&#39;s a bit dull but um the
Virgin Group is a is a is a very complex
structure we are not one trading
organization we are made up of as Sarah
said many different organisations that
are individually operating they&#39;re
independently operating and that makes
my remit a very interesting one to say
the least and so when I moved into the
grief about six years into the group
role about six years ago I came in with
a specific mandate which was to change
the nature of the relationship between
the group and between the operating
companies before I arrived historically
there had been a bit of a disconnection
between the virgin companies and the way
that we did things at virgin group that
there was a sense that group was sitting
in a little bit of an ivory tower and of
course we were we are still that little
bit further removed from some of the
customer challenge in some operating
challenges that the businesses
experienced but my mandate was to build
in some cases and rebuild some bridges
and some connections across the group
but also to encourage the businesses to
build those bridges and connections to
each other you know there&#39;s a huge
amount of power and value in being part
of this global family and we probably
weren&#39;t leveraging that enough and the
way that I went about that was certainly
rocket science but one of the things
that it really reinforced for me is the
importance of face-to-face time which is
kind of challenging if you&#39;ve got
obviously businesses all over the world
but I don&#39;t think many things can
replace the opportunity to sit you know
side by side with someone or across the
table from someone and see the whites of
their eyes and really truly listen to
get a deeper understanding about what&#39;s
going on for that person what&#39;s going on
for that business what are their
challenges what are their requirements
and where are the opportunities for us
to work more effectively together and
once you&#39;ve got that relationship
established you obviously need to keep
you know pay attention to it you need to
maintain it and but it makes it a lot
easier if that if that connection that
that bridge if you like is there to
enable that two-way flow of
communication and it took a lot of time
and effort but I you know I&#39;m very
pleased to say now that we have a
fantastic kind of global community of
certainly of my key stakeholders which
the teams that lead kind of the people
experience in all of the businesses and
that&#39;s because we have that sense that
we have a shared goal and that we&#39;re
supporting each other and that shared
goal and specifically around creating a
great employee experience for our 72,000
employees globally and central to that
is how do we create a sense of meaning
and belonging for our people so we know
that it&#39;s hugely important to Virgin
employees they join the Virgin family we
often use that word there&#39;s some
interesting connotations sometimes
associated with that but when our
employees consider joining us and you
know and after their time with this they
have the expectation that they&#39;re
joining a group of companies they have
an expectation that are joining you know
a much bigger entity than the specific
version company that they arrive at and
so you know part of what my team and the
the people teams try to do is to make
sure that we are creating a global
community of brand advocates there&#39;s
nothing wrong in admitting that but
helping them to make the connections
with each other and helping them to
really feel part
something bigger and we do that through
many different many different things I
think I&#39;ve talked before about the fact
that we do have a really uniting set of
values there&#39;s a lot of debate about the
value of values but they do truly unite
us we talk about our red thread that
runs through the Virgin can a global
community and again we have a number of
mechanisms in place that we try to
ensure create that sense of belonging
for our people one of the things that we
did gosh about two years ago which given
that we&#39;ve been going for forty eight
years you would have thought that virgin
would have had it before we had never
articulated what our employer brand was
we&#39;d never articulated what employees
can expect when they come to work for us
and what we expect of them in return
we all had a gut instinct for what it
was but we also have an allergy to
codifying anything too clearly but we
finally got around to doing this and it
centers around our purpose our business
purpose which is changing business for
good and which essentially means that we
make sure we put people and planet
alongside profit but this purposes are
then underpinned by four pillars and two
of the pillars I think are particularly
relevant to the theme of bridges and
that is be yourself and go to go
together and they&#39;re these these pillars
have to work as pairs they have to be in
balance they have to be in harmony with
one another and the go together for me
really encapsulates that sense that we
are stronger together and as I said
there is a real power and value when we
are aligned and that we&#39;re pulling
behind a shared goal when we have those
connections across the group so that we
can share learnings we can support each
other and some of you may recognize that
sort of phrasing around go together but
it&#39;s it&#39;s actually from an African
proverb which we which we loved I mean
we kind of wanted to emulate that as
much as we can and this African proverb
is if you want to go fast go alone if
you want to go far go together and so
this is this is kind of at the core of
our people promise and how we also think
about diversity and inclusion it frames
the need for people
to be able to be the individuals that
they are and not to put on a corporate
veneer when they walk in the door but to
recognize and respect the fact that we
need to do that an inclusive environment
where everybody is welcome I&#39;m really
conscious and this is going on to a
point that Sarah just made I&#39;m really
conscious that our employees aren&#39;t
unique in wanting that sense of meaning
and wanting that sense of belonging
I studied anthropology at university
many years ago and and that sense of
belonging and kinship is kind of a
fundamental part of the human condition
and it&#39;s been there for millennia you
know and I guess it kind of originally
derived from the fact that we we needed
to be parts we needed to be part of a
tribe or part of a community in order to
survive quite frankly in terms of being
able to defend ourselves against wild
animals and or other tribes and also to
survive in terms of feeding ourselves
and obviously society has moved on some
significant ways since I sort of
hunter-gatherer ancestors but you still
see there&#39;s two kind of tribal
affiliations now in society in many
different components of society so that
that sense of belonging and kinship if
you like is a fundamental part of the
human DNA and that makes me think given
I spend a lot of time trying to think
about what&#39;s the future of work what you
know what do we need to be thinking
about as an employer to make sure that
we&#39;re creating the best kind of
environment this weekend for our people
and there&#39;s a lot of talk about the fact
that you know the gig economy people are
going to be working in portfolio careers
and no longer going to work for one
employer and indeed there may not be
workplaces in the future and I think the
example if you look at like the space we
work space that would suggest that it&#39;s
not going to go down that that extreme
length because people do want that sense
of connection and sense of community
even if they&#39;re not actually working on
the same things people want to feel that
they&#39;re in that kind of hubbub and they
have those those day-to-day connections
and so um you know for me whilst I think
having greater flexibility and greater
choice is hugely hugely important I kind
of take some reassurance in the fact
that we will
never move I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll ever
move away from the fact that you know
people do want those connections in many
different components of their life and
with society&#39;s changing as it as it is
work more often than not is the place
through which people get that sense of
meaning and connection and that&#39;s
certainly something that we hold very
dear at virgin and one of it as I said
one of the kind of cool parts of my job
to work with all the other virgin
companies is to make sure that we are
creating a place where people can find
those connections and that sense of
belonging a sense of meaning that
they&#39;re looking for
