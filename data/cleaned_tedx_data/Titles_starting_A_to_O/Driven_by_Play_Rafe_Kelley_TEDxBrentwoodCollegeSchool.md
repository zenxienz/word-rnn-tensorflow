so most of you in the audience tonight
are reaching the age where it&#39;s time to
get serious about your lives where
you&#39;re supposed to put the hard work in
to make something of yourself and I
think that&#39;s very important it&#39;s it&#39;s
incredibly necessary to have discipline
in life but as you stand on the cusp of
adulthood I want to say I work for play
and we&#39;re going to look at a little
video here there we go

okay so that&#39;s what I do
and we tend to think of play as being
something frivolous or whimsical on our
culture but I think that we need to re
conceptualize play we need to understand
that play is actually one of our most
powerful drives and then once one of the
most powerful means that we have
available to us to become the people
that we want to become so I come from
the movement industry and from the
fitness industry and the biggest problem
that we have in those industries is that
people just aren&#39;t motivated to do it
right everybody knows that you&#39;re
supposed to exercise everybody wants to
be healthy everybody wants to look good
and yet for some reason most people
can&#39;t seem to stop arguing on Twitter
stop playing call of duty put down the
Cheetos and actually go outside or get
to the gym so why is that I think it&#39;s
because fundamentally we&#39;ve
misunderstood the most powerful drive to
get us moving and that drive is the play
drive
so imagine a a small child right
they&#39;ll will go find a hill to slide
down over and over again right as they
do that of course they&#39;re exercising
intensely but they don&#39;t think about it
like that they think about it as fun and
unfortunately we don&#39;t think about it as
exercise either because we&#39;ve come up
with a strange idea that that in order
for something to be useful it kind of
has to be boring and Rudra&#39;s but
actually what we find is when we look at
play play is one of our most powerful
means of learning okay
so play is something that is a
motivational Drive it&#39;s a it&#39;s a force
that you can use and it&#39;s a guide to who
you can become
and a model for for how you can build
yourself within my little work in
movement we&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve seen this over
and over again this is the heart of what
I do I get people to start playing and
I&#39;ve seen the same thing in parkour so
I&#39;ve been in the parkour community for
13 years and I watch it grow from about
a few hundred people worldwide to
probably over millions of people now
and what I&#39;ve seen is in 13 years we&#39;ve
seen this incredible growth and skill
and the people who&#39;ve gone out and done
parkour they&#39;ve become courageous and
competent and really integrated people
in a broad way because what they&#39;ve done
is is essentially rediscover the power
of their play Drive and they&#39;ve applied
it to the urban environment so what does
play actually do why do we play well
play builds your brain play is actually
one of your most powerful learning
systems when we are playing our learning
system or our capacity to learn
increases by something like five hundred
percent when we play our mood increases
stress decreases we increase our
capacity for concentration and
persistence so play is this incredible
powerful medicine for our minds and more
than that it&#39;s actually a means by which
we socialize so yok pong SEP whom I
mentioned earlier he discovered that
there&#39;s a play drive in there in the
mammal brain it&#39;s something very
specific it&#39;s not the same thing as
motivation to eat it&#39;s not the same
thing as motivation for love or
motivation for dominance we&#39;re motivated
to play and if you look at little rats
that are denied play there is motivated
to get in and get a chance to play as
that is if you starve a rat and look at
its motivation to go and eat so why are
we so driven to play research in monkey
models actually shows that we&#39;re so
driven to play that we that the wheel
play even when it&#39;s in a cost to our
growth so what is play doing well
socially what play is doing is it&#39;s
teaching us how to negotiate and
communicate with each other it&#39;s
teaching us where our body is and where
another thing&#39;s body is how to deal with
pain deal with stress deal with conflict
so if you want to be effective social if
you want to make friends easily if you
want to be effective in your career if
you want to be effectively assertive and
also empathic play is actually your
primary learning grounds for this so
every species actually plays in its own
way too you guys have all seen dogs dogs
love to chase and play tag and play
games a tug of war and pull things down
Neath and tear them apart because that&#39;s
how wolves catch their prey similarly if
you watch a cat cats love to stalk and
pounce and grapple and bite
that&#39;s how cats have evolved to make
their living in the world human beings
also have a species specific form of
play and if you look at every culture in
the world you&#39;ll find that we also love
to play games of tag and chase
we are also pursue predators we also
love to play hide-and-seek and ambush
each other like cats we ambush our prey
and we&#39;re also prey animals so we need
to hide we need to be able to run away
and we climb trees human beings are
primates primates have been in the trees
for 90 million years you have binocular
vision and grasping hands and any number
of other features because they have all
first in the trees so when we look at
play what we&#39;re actually seeing is a
guideline to how you can best move in
order to become the best version of
yourself as a human being but a human
being is a very interesting thing
because human beings play in very
diverse ways so some of you guys may
love say long-distance running that was
a really important aspect of our evolved
movement too but some of you may hate it
personally I found it pretty miserable
until pretty recently in my life
likewise some of you guys may love team
sports and some of you may prefer solo
activities well the thing about human
beings that makes us really unique is
that we share and we collaborate for the
most part other animals that don&#39;t share
food like wolves work together to take
down and prey but then they try to wolf
as much of the food down as possible try
to guard it from all the other wolves
chimpanzees will share with their young
the the females and you know lots of
animals will share with young but for
the most part they don&#39;t share between
peers where human beings do if you take
down on a bison you share with everyone
in the tribe and because of that we
actually benefit from temperamental
variations in our personalities right
it&#39;s good for you it&#39;s good for me if
you and I don&#39;t have the same strengths
because then as a super organism as a
group of animals we&#39;re stronger so some
of you guys may be very risk tolerant
some of you guys may be more risk averse
that&#39;s actually something that helps the
whole tribe because somebody needs to be
the guy who&#39;s gonna jump off the cliff
and somebody needs to be the person
who&#39;s going to say hey this is dangerous
let&#39;s not do this and this tells you
something about the type of life that
you&#39;re gonna thrive best in
because the type of person who loves to
jump off a cliff
is someone who is high in risk tolerance
and risk tolerance is critical if you
want to be for instance an entrepreneur
it&#39;s also critical if you want to be an
artist you have to take a lot of risks
if you&#39;re an athlete or an artist to
make success in your career so you need
some risk tolerance on the other hand
some of you guys may enjoy putting
things together in a very specific way
in a very orderly way
and that&#39;s actually a measure of your
conscientiousness people who are really
orderly and like to put things in place
or people who are gonna do well in
accounting and management or if you like
to take things apart and put them back
together you&#39;re gonna find that you do
well as an engineer so the way that you
play is actually a way to motivate
yourself it&#39;s a way to understand your
own personality and it&#39;s a way to
integrate the different aspects of your
personality think of life as a big game
it&#39;s filled with many little micro games
that you can play and in each game
there&#39;s times when it&#39;s gonna be fun and
playful and easy and there are times
when it&#39;s gonna be hard and you&#39;re gonna
have to grind you&#39;re gonna have to have
grit you&#39;re gonna have to have
discipline but go back to that little
kid climbing the hill all right if you
don&#39;t have discipline then you don&#39;t get
to climb the hill you&#39;re not gonna drag
your inner tubes back to the top and so
you don&#39;t get to go down the slip and
slide if you&#39;re not willing to work hard
you don&#39;t get to play the best games but
there&#39;s a flip side of that which is
that if all you ever do is grind and
grind and grind if you&#39;re always
disciplined if you&#39;re always pushing and
you never take the time to slide back
down the hill if you never let play lead
and motivate you you&#39;re gonna end up 20
years into your career completely burned
out you&#39;re gonna have maybe success
you&#39;re gonna have power you&#39;re gonna
have prestige you&#39;re gonna have money
the nice car whatever it is but you&#39;re
gonna feel hollow inside because you
never discovered the aspects of yourself
that you&#39;re most passionate about you
never found your own inner drives you
want to set yourself up so that you&#39;re
engaging the things that are rewarding
to you not just the people around you so
the thing about play is that it&#39;s
intrinsically motivating you will do it
whether you get a good grade
or you get no great you will do it
whether you paid or you don&#39;t get paid
you will do it whether you get a gold
star or not and if we go back to the
model of the the little rats who didn&#39;t
get a chance to play unfortunately we
live in a culture where kind of all of
us are experiencing that way take kids
at five years old and put them in seats
for six hours a day and they don&#39;t get a
full chance to play so it&#39;s easy in our
lives to not connect with your own
deepest motivations and I think that&#39;s a
big reason why we have epidemics of
anxiety and depression the modern era
because people don&#39;t know how to play so
the great thing is as you guys age you
grow up and you get a chance to build
the own your own game of life right you
get to design the game for yourself and
as you do I would suggest that you build
a game that incorporates your own drive
to play right when we are playing we are
at our most inspired we are at our most
creative so design a game that works for
you so study the way that you play as an
individual right in my own life the way
that I&#39;m trying to set myself up is I
love to Train I love to move all right I
want to jump and climb and flip I love
to teach and train and work with people
and I love to share my ideas with people
so if I understand that about myself
then I know something about the type of
life that I want to live so define your
winning conditions right figure out what
a great life looks like to you do you
need to make a lot of money are you
happier with less are you someone who&#39;s
very passionate about traveling the
world are you somebody who really loves
to stay home and cultivate something
deeply are you somebody who likes to
work with others or you&#39;re somebody who
likes to work solo all those can you can
discover through through playing games
and then figure out who you are and what
game you&#39;re gonna thrive in so to find
your winning conditions once you&#39;re
there what you want to do is use your
passions to motivate you so we all have
to go through the hard parts in our life
what you want to do is keep in mind that
the things that you care about in your
profession in your life are the rewards
for the work that you have to do
next what you want to do don&#39;t forget
your place sir is you want to find
strategies to stack your time you want
to find strategies where more and more
of the time that you spend is spent on
doing the things that are intrinsically
rewarding for you the ultimate win the
best game to play is the game where
everything that you do for money
is something that you would choose to do
for fun in my own life I my biggest need
maybe is to market and to administrate
my business so within marketing you know
I could go and I could study lots of
different marketing mechanisms but to be
honest my eyes kind of glaze over when I
have to read about cost-per-click and
advanced behavioural targeting but what
I love to do is I love to move so when I
can make a video and share with people
that&#39;s marketing when I write an essay
on something that&#39;s deep that I&#39;m deeply
passionate about that&#39;s also content
marketing so the more that I can
leverage the things that I&#39;m passionate
about to achieve the things that I need
the better the game that I get to play
is the more fun I have and actually the
more productive I am so remember these
these these ideas if you can define your
life this way if you can take place
seriously and set yourself up to play a
game that&#39;s deeply meaningful to you
you&#39;re going to be far more productive
in the long run
and you&#39;re gonna have so much more fun
doing it thank you guys
