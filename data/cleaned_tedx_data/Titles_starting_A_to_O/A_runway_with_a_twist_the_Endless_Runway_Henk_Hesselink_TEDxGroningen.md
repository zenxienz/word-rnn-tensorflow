I love science fiction films I love to
see how creative people imagine a future
that is very different from our world in
1919
one creative writer imagined cars would
very soon become obsolete
the aircraft had just been invented and
we would all use this to fly to work so
on top of the skyscrapers in New York he
invented a structure that we could use
to fly to our offices now we&#39;re not
going to work like this but still in 100
years of aviation we&#39;ve reached a lot
we&#39;ve come from wooden aircraft to
airframes made of advanced composite
materials we&#39;ve come from navigating by
the Stars to the use of complex
algorithms to guide our way we even cut
down flight times for intercontinental
flights from days to last only hours but
still with all these advances in the
aircraft why hasn&#39;t the airport been
changed now you may think I never
thought about that why do you need to
change if it isn&#39;t broken don&#39;t fix it
well our Airport system does not beat a
future demands already when you travel
to an airport now you see on busy days
it is extremely crowded and this will
only get worse
aviation doubles every 15 years which
means that in 2030 there will be twice
the number of people traveling on twice
the number of planes traveling twice the
distance as they do today
2,050 it means there will be three or
four times as many as today this also
puts an enormous pressure on our
environment we have subscribed to the
sustainable mobility goals of the Paris
agreement which means that the impact of
aviation will has to read will have to
reduce despite the fact that it grows
concreted means for example that the co2
emissions will have to be reduced with
75% in the year 2050 this will not work
without current straight runways and
then we have the problem of the weather
in stormy wind conditions aircraft have
problems with landing and you probably
think I&#39;m happy I was not onboard this
aircraft I know I am still pilots are
trained for these situations but this
aircraft has to circle around a couple
of times before being able to make a
landing which means delay extra fuel
burn and not only for this aircraft but
for all the ones to follow as well then
why in a hundred years
airports have not changed we need an
innovation in airports we need a
breakthrough this is what we have
designed this Airport design was made by
me and my team at the Netherlands
Aerospace Center together with a team of
experts from all over Europe and the
European Commission it is a large
circumventing runway which offers the
possibility to put the buildings in the
middle the diameter of the runway is
three and a half kilometers meaning this
runway is 11 kilometres long now here&#39;s
how it works
the aircraft flies straight in until at
the last moment it aligns its structure
with the size of the runway the sides
are banked as you can see which means
the aircraft will stay on the surface
just like you see on highways or on rail
tracks the aircraft does not circle
around a couple of times before coming
to a full stop it will only require the
use of about one quarter of the runway
for landing this means you will not feel
like you&#39;re in a rollercoaster and just
as well it means we can have three
aircraft simultaneously on the runway
while still including safety margins for
any possible error
this runway offers the possibility to
fly in from different directions so if
you make a landing you do not have to
circle around anymore
before lining up to the runway it also
means for taking off you do not have to
wait in a long queue but you can enter
anywhere you would like and just as well
as the buildings are in the middle the
taxi times from the gate to the runway
is much shorter than it is today now you
may think you set 11 kilometres of
runway that is quite a lot and it is
quite a lot but if you compare this
compare our airport with the current
airport of Paris and this is Paris shell
the goal you see that our runway only
requires about half of the size of the
current airfields you may think okay
this is nice but it&#39;s a big Airport can
you live up to the standard of this
Airport
if you depicted on this Airport does
this really work or is this science
fiction and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve tried to
find out as well
we have modeled the airport of Paris
shall the goal which is one of the
busiest airports in Europe we have taken
the busiest day of the year that is one
day in July we took all the traffic that
occurred on that day and depicted it on
a computer model that we made from the
endless runway we put our system to the
test and we found it works our research
shows air traffic controllers are
capable of managing multiple aircraft on
the runway and it also shows air traffic
controllers are capable of managing
traffic coming from different directions
we also measure two reductions in
emissions because aircrafts can now fly
straight in or if the fly outs greyed
out and very important this runway it&#39;s
much less depending on the weather
if the wind is blowing too strong from a
certain direction
this runway only faces partial closure
meaning we have a sustainable capacity
all year long now you may think does
this affect me as a passenger it will it
will also affect pilots they will need
additional training it will affect
engineers we need to redesign landing
gears we need to look what happens with
the tires you may also think this is a
crazy idea well the video was posted on
Facebook for this endless runway and I
never imagined it would go viral in just
two or three days and up to today over
50 million people have seen the video of
the endless runway I&#39;m totally amazed by
that and I only hope that this crazy
idea inspires you to also keep an open
mind in science and to keep innovating
let&#39;s realize our dream for an endless
runway and for a new generation of
airports and move from science fiction
to science fact
thank you
