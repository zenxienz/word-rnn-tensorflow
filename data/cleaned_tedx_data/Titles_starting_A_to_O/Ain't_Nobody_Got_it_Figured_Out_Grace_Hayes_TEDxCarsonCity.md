[Music]
hey thank you so much hello everyone I
hope you&#39;re doing well my name is Grace
Hayes and I love people I believe in the
power of individuality
everybody&#39;s got such a unique
irreplaceable incomparable presence
going on so I got a question for you
have you ever met someone not by
standing next to them you felt a little
bit braver or maybe they don&#39;t have to
say a single word but their presence is
just calming to you I have a friend that
whenever I&#39;m around her my soul feels
like it&#39;s slipping on chamomile by her
simply being she&#39;s bettered me and I
find it curious that we can also easily
agree that beauty fills everyone but are
quick to believe that we are somehow an
exception to that rule
now self-doubt is no stranger to me
because I like a multitude of artists
struggle with something called impostor
syndrome and that&#39;s a little bit like
looking around your workplace and going
whoa I don&#39;t belong here everybody knows
what they&#39;re doing but me they got it
all figured out and my business cards
are a photo of myself with the body of a
llama
yikes imposter syndrome is considering
yourself to be a very strategic mess if
we thrive in a specific field we figure
we&#39;re just winging it
so the validity of our hard work is
undermined in our own mind you deny that
you had a role in any of your
achievements figuring you took a
backseat to luck chance and people who
are none the wiser to your shenanigans
but they&#39;re on to you soon you&#39;ll be
outed as a fraud and the facade of your
accomplishments will crash and burn
because it&#39;s psychologically easier to
draw on our shortcomings weren&#39;t able to
internalize our successes now coming
back to eleven people
I wouldn&#39;t question the impact of my
friend&#39;s music or art yet my internal
narrative tends to go graves what are
you doing talking jive right and chicken
scratch your ideas are just as
discombobulated as your hair
my actual thoughts are a lot meaner but
I&#39;m trying to keep this talk--i PG maybe
you can relate
have you ever judged yourself through
other people superimposing what you
think about you into someone else&#39;s head
it&#39;s going I believe that about me so it
must be blatant to this guy that I&#39;m not
when in reality your flaws aren&#39;t even
Crossin homeboys mind consistently
questioning yourself and how others view
you is detrimental to living your truth
being you not the you you think the
world wants but the you that you want
existing in a state of not enough is
paralyzing so how do we return to our
truth when I think of people who are
true to themselves I picture children
and the elderly they are the epitome of
not caring what anybody thinks so I&#39;m a
child voice coach I teach four to ten
year olds and if I were to go up to one
of my students and say hey write me a
song here&#39;s a beat they are on it nine
times out of ten doesn&#39;t even rhyme but
it&#39;s beautiful they&#39;re singing about
their pets their mom green beans what
have you complete artistic freedom turn
around and ask an adult for freestyle
and the results are usually something
like why what about I&#39;m unprepared let
me check my google calendar I&#39;ll get
back to you next week kids are naturally
transparent and we are afraid of looking
silly keep in mind looking silly is not
the worst thing that could happen to you
so what&#39;s the deal with these being
yourself bookends the way I see it when
you&#39;re little you don&#39;t know nothing
about the status quo and no one&#39;s told
you that you&#39;re wrong yet so we get
older and grow in societal and cultural
understanding and we are pressured into
conformity don&#39;t act think or do
anything differently that&#39;ll set you
apart so we pursue normality pursue
perfection and by the time we&#39;re old or
we are exhausted from this chase and why
is enough to know that those constructs
don&#39;t even exist so we return to freedom
consider this if there
no such thing as normal or perfect how
come we&#39;re running headfirst into these
unobtainable goals and beating ourselves
up overcoming short freedom begins when
you start disassembling lies that you
believe about yourself for example when
I was younger I hated my hair I
straightened it every single day and
finally asked how come and I figured ok
growing up I was told curly hair is ugly
straight hair is pretty so if you got
some waves I got some bad news for you
so I believed it I don&#39;t anymore but
that&#39;s why it&#39;s so important to evaluate
what you&#39;re feeling
identify why and dismantle the lies so
we all know is that the media portrays
very narrow standards of beauty not a
lot of hair skin and body types are
widely represented you see beauty
articles entitled 15 celebrities who
shouldn&#39;t be confident in bikini but our
actual celeb clothing sizes that&#39;ll make
you feel better about your own body well
first of all confidence is not a
commodity we&#39;re not born with a static
sense of self in direct correlation to
how society will value us God doesn&#39;t
look down at babies in utero and go this
child will grow up to be a
conventionally attractive male with a
favorable socio-economical background X
amount of confidence for the rest of
your days and oh this kid&#39;s gonna grow
up to be a frizzy songwriter who spills
copious amounts of coffee on herself but
look about right Gabriel X amount of
confidence that doesn&#39;t happen right
self-confidence is not a ration also
it&#39;s not rational it&#39;s strictly
emotional there&#39;s no logic or reasoning
behind it that&#39;s why you can be
incredible in what you do and
simultaneously believe that your work is
worthless and that&#39;s why five-year-old
me made one weird-looking sculpture out
of hot glue gun blobs and thought that
was my best work now you may be
wondering who gives a five-year-old a
hot glue gun
well my parents
they are in the building today I just
wanted to say mom and dad thank you so
much for allowing me freedom and
creative liberties at a young age albeit
dangerous ones coming back to
self-confidence it is a variable not a
constant to me its title like creativity
and M flow a daily struggle to tell
myself my input is valuable and pursuing
my truth is worthwhile I admire people
who can provide advice from a place of
completely overcoming self-doubt that&#39;s
not me though I cried in a Chili&#39;s
thinking about giving this talk but
actively dealing with a problem isn&#39;t
sad it&#39;s just real victory is not just
for those who had victory is for those
who have it&#39;s for people who have
overcome and are overcoming here&#39;s a
crazy idea be nice to you you&#39;re doing a
great job take time to congratulate
yourself on your killer personality or
shoes allow yourself the space to feel
whether that&#39;s feeling proud or bummed
about your performance as long as you
understand your not your performance and
you don&#39;t have to force positive
affirmations on yourself if you&#39;re not
feeling it if looking in the mirror and
going you&#39;re great feels dissin genuine
at first start small meet yourself
halfway with self talk instead of
immediately going I hate myself for
missing this deadline find the middle
ground like I feel like I let my team
down and when it&#39;s right work towards
positivity something like I know that
I&#39;m capable I love my heart and how much
it cares for my co-workers and look
forward to going above and beyond next
time you&#39;ve got that same something that
you see in others what it&#39;s your own
don&#39;t question it one of the biggest
mistakes you can make is waiting for
someone to give you permission to be
yourself there are so many things that
need to be said that only can be said
with a life and how it&#39;s lived don&#39;t
deprive the world another day of the
gift that is you living your truth
with the amount of sadness that fills
the world we can&#39;t afford to hold hatred
in our hearts
now you&#39;ve been towards ourselves so um
with that being said I want to talk
about well give you a poem this is a
poem I wrote it&#39;s called boy voices and
it&#39;s about loving yourself well and
loving others and it goes like this
I&#39;m not the only one who lives in my
head
civilizations stretched wide across
synapses rich culture vibrant ancestry
find me between foothills a false
dichotomy political anomalies
autobiographies that read we shy away
behind online anonymity painting our
brother to be the enemy you see these
stings are similar to those of see and
enemies no conscience nor consequences
in high tide come low it&#39;s time to hide
where the current of emotion surges you
will see carnal urges metastasize
discriminating with whom we empathize
two vital organs demanding pick aside
frequencies playing contrasted
distinctly dissonant tones we find
comfort in the belief that we are not
alone that we will be well received by
strangers on the streets we would like
to believe that permanent aspects of our
composure will not perpetuate a ride on
this nightmarish rollercoaster we never
asked to get on in the first place
have you ever looked to fear in the face
when you listen to your own thoughts who
do you hear if it&#39;s just you you are for
taking in the highest form of vanity I&#39;d
go as far as to question your sanity if
you do not hear voices other than your
own voices that cry no not in my home
voices behind hard-working hands rough
from shaping this land into a sanctuary
for our peers a safe haven as it is in
heaven speaking you were welcome here
voices that chill and not your bones
voices that only martyrdom could compose
high-pitched shrill shrieks of those
that orchestrate the conjugal fate but
justice seats voices
that still speak long after
assassination attempts of silence each
word trembling with a depth that is
known violence but they speak regardless
of what they see these voices set
emotions and movement emotion into
motion like the waves of the ocean each
drop of love each drop of peace rippling
far beyond the peak of eternity voices
that instill bravery voices that see
that the future is more than just me are
you the only one who lives in your head
you get more than two choices beyond you
beyond me there&#39;s us instead you&#39;re
crazy if you don&#39;t hear voices thank you
you
