my first client as a professional
counselor was a little girl named Marie
she was three-and-a-half years old she
was nonverbal hadn&#39;t spoken a word since
she&#39;s picked up by Child Protective
Services both she and her six-year-old
sister were being treated for gonorrhea
this was my first professional client
now I can tell you folks that I was not
interested in this being my lifelong
journey my plan was to get some
practical counseling experience then
move into a ph.d program for
organizational psychology where I could
learn about how to help corporate
America make more money and myself too
but Marie changed that I was working as
a volunteer for a sex center against
sexual assault in Phoenix Arizona in
1981 and the organization realized that
I had a statistics and research
background so they asked me to take a
part-time job as their data analyst a
veteran therapist there knew that I was
in the master&#39;s program for counseling
and asked if I would be interested in
helping her with this children&#39;s play
group I said I would like to do that she
explained that there were a half a dozen
children in this group ages three to
seven and all of them were for dealing
with abuse of some kind various levels
of extreme and that she wanted me to pay
special attention to this little girl
named Marie
she seemed to be having a harder time
than most so I&#39;d had the opportunity to
use things I&#39;d learned working at the
preschool at Arizona State University to
make a relationship between Maria and
myself I&#39;d pay attention to what she was
looking at and how she was reacting and
every once in a while I&#39;d make eye
contact and give her a nice smile I
treat her very respectfully and I&#39;d show
her the different options she had for
colors and and all the different
drawings that she could do different
activities but she didn&#39;t speak about
session four she was becoming more
animated and involved making more eye
contact and smiling and at the end of
that session that play therapy session
they were having a sing-along and all of
a sudden Marie out of the blue joined in
so the first sounds I ever heard from
this little girl named Marie was of her
singing a joyful sound that touched me
but the message really came home to me
two weeks later I was at a street fair
in downtown Tempe and on a crowded
sidewalk on that particular day I heard
a small voice behind me seemed to be
calling my name but it was a little
fuzzy so I stopped and I turned and when
I did the crowd parted like the Red Sea
and there was Marie running up the
sidewalk her foster parents behind her
and her sister they were walking hand in
hand and smiling over the fact that they
had surprised me it was delightful
I got down on one knee and I greeted
Marie as she got close we gave each
other a hug and she just talked and
talked about all the adventures that
they had that morning all the things
they had done all the things they were
going to do
and we just chatted there on that busy
sidewalk as Marie left with her family
she turned around and she waved bye mr.
CooCoo doll my name is pronounced
Kuykendall but she called me mr. keuken
doll and that was precious I could not
turn away I I simply could not or would
not turn away from what had happened a
transformational moment or time in this
little girl&#39;s life had happened and I
was a part of it and nothing else that I
had imagined in my future seemed to
matter because I was a part of something
that seemed profoundly precious and it
has been for 20 years I worked
delivering direct services to children
and families who were victims of sexual
abuse from survivors for the next 14
years I spent much of my time caregiving
the most remarkable survivor of
childhood sexual abuse I&#39;ve ever known
that&#39;s my late wife Carol Jarvis
Kuykendall we were married 28 years and
now today I have a daughter that I&#39;m
gonna have the cut for also I provide as
good counseling as I can for her also
because she suffers from many of the
same problems her mother did and we
found Joey in peace in her life it&#39;s
important that you know that that there
is joy and peace after such horrible
ugly things can happen to a child
I&#39;d like you to imagine now with me that
there are children coming down the
middle aisle the aisles on the side a
variety of children coming onstage to
form a line and a little bit of a crowd
here facing you and these are special
children to me because these are the
children I&#39;ve worked with or that my
wife worked with oh that some of my
colleagues have worked with I&#39;ve known
all of these children and as you see
them line up behind me and fan out on
both sides behind this chair I want you
to see that there are people there are
children there for various ages various
races socio-economic groups gender
identities philosophies religions every
one of those things are represented here
this is a diverse group of children and
the thing that they all have in common
is that they have been or will be
sexually abused in their lives they&#39;re a
happy looking group they know that
they&#39;re here for me today the show the
younger ones are standing in front the
older ones are standing behind and
they&#39;re here to show themselves to you
this is a profound profession I&#39;ve been
in for the last 30-some years it has a
joys that I had no idea we&#39;re going to
come in the face of truly ugly things
that can happen to children there are
beauty there is something sacred in this
work and I invite you all to not let the
ugly truths of this scare you away from
being involved
some of these children have bounced back
very easily or they&#39;re quite resilient
or maybe the abuse was minimal but some
of them are going to struggle all of
their life off and on with the results
of that trauma many of them are not
going to make it and that&#39;s what the
empty chairs about some of them are
going to die from their injuries soon
some of them can possibly go off into
drug and alcohol abuse risk-taking
behaviors even suicide some of the
children don&#39;t make it but these
children have and we celebrate the fact
that we&#39;re enjoying life together and
after today&#39;s presentation we&#39;re all
going over to aunt Rose&#39;s house for a
celebration of life party which is a
wonderful thing I&#39;d like to leave you
with three important principles or
points one is that there&#39;s a commonality
of purpose here today it&#39;s whatever the
divisive &#39;no still Drance parents have
had due to various demographic groups or
races or religions we all love these
children that&#39;s what we have in common
across all these other boundaries or
borders we love these children and we
want the best for them that commonality
of purpose I&#39;ve seen it in therapy more
times than I can count
families parents come together to talk
about the fact that their children had
been
abused and what they discover is that
they empathize with each other that
they&#39;ve reach across what would have
been boundaries that they couldn&#39;t
imagine crossing and they embrace each
other in their love for each other&#39;s
children and they help each other this
is a powerful dynamic and human
relationships second and my word choice
is quite deliberate here sexual abuse of
children is predominantly a man-made
problem man-made problem there aren&#39;t
many men working in this industry
historically women lead the charge on
this issue on this cause saving children
and giving them services that will help
them thrive as children too many men are
standing on the sidelines so part of my
purpose for being here today is to make
a call call to action for men to get
more involved to partner up with the
women who are leading this this world of
saving and helping children have been
sexually abused we need men in this
equation men who can empathize and be
kind and compassionate who can bring
time energy money or political capital
to this cause if you are involved in
this industry this profession this cause
men I salute you I embrace you I
celebrate your contribution if you&#39;re
not involved I want you to know that I
embrace you too they&#39;re good men let&#39;s
become more involved let&#39;s make sure
that all of these children get the
services they need because what we know
right now is
that the children of privilege are going
to get the services the brown and the
black children aren&#39;t going to get as
many as the white children and at the
bottom of the this Gale is probably the
red children we need some equality we
need some services for all of them
regardless of all the other parts of our
adult equation we want these children to
have a chance at life
that&#39;s our commonality of purpose and
third is this we&#39;re in a time an era if
you will of chaos and confusion of
deception and hidden agendas on a
national and world scale sometimes we
don&#39;t know what&#39;s gonna happen next
sometimes we don&#39;t want to watch the
news we we&#39;re at a decisive moment in
history and what I&#39;d like to suggest is
this notion that our love of these
children can bring us together in a
commonality of purpose that if we
partner with other groups that don&#39;t
look like us or don&#39;t sound like us and
we build a relationship on the fact that
we love these children and we want them
to have a full and happy life
who knows what else we might be able to
talk to each other about we could take
this ugly truth and turn it into
something profound by talking with each
other about how to help them
they&#39;re giving me the eye because they
know we&#39;re close to a big finale
I thank you all for being here and for
all of you at home listening let us be
brave let&#39;s be committed and let&#39;s
imagine a world where all these children
get their needs met
are we ready all right you remember how
we rehearsed it okay let&#39;s start our
wave okay one two three
see you later alligator
you
