hi good morning so I want to actually
help some of you who are maybe born in
the last 45 years to understand what the
60s look like see this is a picture of
the sixties in fact this is what a
photograph looked like from the 60s this
is me in bed in my footie pajamas you
know and I have in my hand what you
would call a tablet but we called it a
comic book and those comic books showed
us static images and stories and we read
these and we also read science fiction
written by Clark and Bradbury and in
Heinlein and we dreamed about the future
we dreamed about a world in which we
would have the wrist communicators and
we would have jetpacks and we would have
talking computers and robots and even
flying cars now everything I just
mentioned exists except for maybe the
flying car now we have the self-driving
car but all those amazing prescient
authors who imagined so many wonderful
things didn&#39;t think of the most amazing
inventions since the beginning or the
creation of the alphabet and that is the
creation of the World Wide Web the world
wide web has brought together our entire
planet
there are over 3.8 billion people
connected on the world wide web at
Lightspeed now that&#39;s pretty fast you
know a message can go around the planet
seven and a half times in a second when
it&#39;s traveling over the web it&#39;s enabled
so many amazing things to happen last
year I worked with net Scout systems and
Verner Hertzog to build a film called lo
and behold reveries of the connected
world and in that film we interviewed
Sebastian Thrun and Sebastian Thrun was
the inventor of the Google car and
Sebastian told us that the great thing
about autonomous vehicles is that every
newborn car
is as smart as every car that came
before it you&#39;re born with all of the
knowledge that it takes to travel
through a city as a newborn autonomous
vehicle and that&#39;s kind of cool
it&#39;s not just cars that are driving
themselves because also last year
Budweiser made the first fully
autonomous beer run they drove 120 miles
down the highway there was two drivers
in the cab but they weren&#39;t driving and
they delivered fifty thousand cans of
Budweiser using auto technology which is
a company that was a spin-out from
Google and it&#39;s owned by uber and so in
the very near future we&#39;re gonna see a
lot of 18 wheelers and semi trucks
driving down the road and don&#39;t be
surprised if maybe the guys drinking a
beer because it won&#39;t matter right but
when the beer gets to your destination
it also needs to get to your house and
how you gonna do that well 7-elevens got
this figured out because they deployed
an Air Force of drones and again last
year 7-eleven delivered 77 packages in
Reno
they beat Amazon they beat Walmart and
they&#39;re flying Slurpees and hot dogs
through the air now some of us who went
to middle school know that flying
Slurpees are not a good thing but in
this case it may not be so bad they can
also deliver medicines which is really
interesting
but think about this these drones are
gonna be part of our everyday life
whether you think that&#39;s a good thing or
not it&#39;s gonna happen
telex is a company that also believes
that once you teach one robot how to do
something all the others should know it
so they created the 1 million robot
challenge and after you teach a robot
how to perform a very delicate operation
such as lifting an egg every other robot
who taps into that cloud knows it so if
every one of these robots learns a
different operation then these robots
are gonna learn well a million times
faster and talking about robots here&#39;s a
pretty good-sized one this is the Falcon
5 rocket which was built by Elon Musk&#39;s
company SpaceX now Elon Musk and Jeff
Bezos of Amazon both have visions of
going into space and Elon has an intent
to go to Mars
with his bfr his big f rocket
and and it&#39;s a pretty glorious goal and
one of the things that Elan wants to do
to be able to finance his mission to
Mars is to launch four thousand six
hundred and fifty eight low-earth orbit
satellites into space to surround our
planet with broadband communications and
one ways one way he&#39;s going to afford to
do that is that unlike NASA Elon does
not throw away his Rockets every rocket
that he sends up into space he flies
back down on earth robotically and it
lands on a robotic barge that&#39;s pretty
good recycling you know sixty million
dollars worth every time not a bad idea
so once we get this broadband
communications network around the planet
a lot of things are going to become
really interesting for instance these
devices here are going to be able to
charge themselves from radio waves jiva
Wireless has figured out how to take
vibrations from radio frequency and
activate it and turn it into electrons
so now you don&#39;t have to change the
batteries which is gonna be really good
for people with pacemakers or hearing
aids and we have so many different
sensors around the world in fact Cisco
and Intel predict we&#39;re gonna have 200
billion sensors by the year 2020
200 billion things they&#39;re basically
anything that is collecting data whether
it&#39;s temperature humidity moisture from
the soil to help farmers plant their
crops is going to have an IP address
it&#39;s gonna talk over the web all this
data is gonna get collected aggregated
and analyzed and you&#39;ll have the tiniest
sensor detecting moisture and soil to
the largest sensors which are driving
combines and tractors down the fields of
the prairies and they&#39;re they&#39;re being
driven with a resolution of one
centimeter
that&#39;s a lot better than any farmer can
can control a device so we&#39;re going into
a very interesting world and these
things are going to instrument our lives
they&#39;re gonna talk about our health and
well-being and they&#39;re also going to be
part of everyday living and the other
thing that&#39;s part of all of our lives is
the fact that this just happened I mean
stop and think about it the reason I
started the 60s is because back in the
60s we wrote letters and we
hand-delivered
we had vinyl and that went to VHS but
but now we send text around the world at
Lightspeed and we voice dictate we
talked to our computers and they talk
back to us vinyl and VHS have become
mp3s and and and binging weekends on
Netflix all this stuff has just happened
and all the data that gets created is
actually useful
AJ Bhangarh who is the CEO of MasterCard
was recently speaking to the Arab
investment forum and he told all these
oil sheiks that data is the new oil so
you&#39;re walking around with a computer in
your pocket that is a million times this
is not just some number a million times
faster than the computers that were used
to put a Saturn 5 rocket into space the
first rocket that put a man on the moon
a million times in your pocket that&#39;s a
big deal and all these devices that are
living in your house share that kind of
power and these devices in your house
are you know your Alexa your Google your
thermostat maybe your refrigerator but
it&#39;s also simple things like your TV TVs
that can watch you and listen to you
in fact silver pushes work with Procter
and Gamble and a bunch of other
companies to transmit ultrasonic beacons
from your TV program to determine if
you&#39;re in the room well how do they know
that because your phone is listening and
it tells them that Jim&#39;s in the room or
Ren&#39;s in the room or Bob&#39;s in the room
and that&#39;s a really valuable thing for
Procter &amp; Gamble because they know if
you&#39;re watching their program and
another thing that we might want to
think about is what happens when we&#39;re
surfing the web because there may be a
computer on that kitchen desk and when
we go and visit that central location
which is CNET or the New York Times or
Forbes did you know that there are 40 50
60 maybe even 70 other parties listening
to what you&#39;re doing these are websites
this is an image of what happens when
you go online it&#39;s as if you went to a
cocktail party to go talk to a dear
friend of yours and you&#39;re just about to
lean over talk about your chronic
athlete&#39;s foot and everybody surrounds
you and listens in
it&#39;s a little bit disturbing don&#39;t you
think and there are other things that we
have to think about because all that
data is being recorded and kept so
Google recently sent out their minis
which is a smaller Google home and they
send a bunch of them to their their
directors and they revealed that oh by
the way we didn&#39;t mention to you they&#39;re
listening all the time if you&#39;re an
Android user they&#39;re 234 apps that they
found researchers found on the Android
Play Store that are listening you know
for beacons enough also for human speech
they can recognize key words yeah as a
marketer and my background is in
technology and marketing it&#39;s so
incredibly valuable to me to be able to
know when you want to buy something so
if you&#39;re chatting with your friend
about this car that car and I get to
hear about that isn&#39;t the great time to
step in and say hey I work at Mercedes I
want to sell you a car that&#39;s what this
technology can do and that&#39;s why Google
you know who recorded 89 billion dollars
last year and Facebook who just recorded
their twenty billion dollar quarter make
all that money I mean you would get
these services you know when you search
Google you&#39;re searching one point
trillion pages of data
it happened comes back at three quarters
of a second that&#39;s a pretty amazing
thing it takes a lot of compute did you
pay for those data centers the answer is
yes you paid for it with your attention
and with your date with your time when
your data so this is a record of a trip
that I took into the city with my wife
you know to celebrate her birthday and
go shopping and have dinner with the
kids this is not a map that I created
this is a map of Google following what
we did that day and if you&#39;re curious as
to where you were last year or the year
before or the year before you can log
into your Google account and you can
pull this up it goes back 10 years and
if you ever said to Google hey where&#39;s
the best place to get pizza in New York
that conversations on their records
every time you say ok Google perks up
not ok Google but every time you say ok
so ever if you ever use the word ok in
your conversations
Google&#39;s listening another thing you
might want to think about is IP cameras
there they&#39;re really very popular you
can buy them for you know less than $50
and they transmit over the web and you
can watch them on your phone and so you
can monitor what&#39;s happening at your
business or your your home and one of
the biggest manufacturers of these
cameras
we called hikvision and they&#39;re watching
you and hikvision is owned by the
chinese government they put six billion
dollars into hikvision they have twenty
eight thousand employees
it&#39;s a twenty six billion dollar
industry it&#39;s growing at double digits
and it&#39;s really cool technology except
for maybe one minor setback the fact is
that when the US State Department
installed these cameras in Kabul in the
embassy they discovered that the video
being recorded somehow was making its
way back to China so you may not be an
important enough for the Chinese to spy
on you but if you have a hikvision
camera or what&#39;s called in the u.s. easy
vis then they can and that&#39;s not
necessarily a good thing so all this
stuff I talk to you about is really
what&#39;s happening you know kind of in the
digital space and in the digital world
it&#39;s all data that&#39;s being collected
about you and your behavior and where
you go but there&#39;s other data about you
which is really important too
in 1990 the US government set out to
unlock the human genome they said it was
gonna take 15 years well thankfully it
took 13 years and it came in under
budget instead of three billion dollars
we spent 2.7 billion dollars it&#39;s a
pretty good deal so 3 billion base pairs
of DNA are unlocked in the human genome
and we&#39;re off to the races you know how
long it takes today to unlock or to
sequence a human genome with the compute
power we have doesn&#39;t take 15 years or
13 years it takes 26 hours and it costs
$1,000 so you have to ask the question
if it costs a thousand dollars it takes
26 hours how can 23andme charge $79 to
sequence the human genome Anne Wojcicki
who started 23andme was married to
Sergey Brin Sergey Brin is a founder of
Google is Google a search company no
Google is a data company Google to
collects data and they sell that data to
help people market well Anne Wojcicki
wants to be the Google of you they want
to be the Google of DNA they&#39;ve already
got two million records in there and
there&#39;s a lot of great stuff that&#39;s
gonna come out of it you know do you
have a propensity for breast cancer or
Alzheimer&#39;s or Parkinson&#39;s that&#39;s really
great and your stuff can also be used to
research your cures for really important
diseases she&#39;s making money
by partnering with 30 life sciences
companies who are using her pooled DNA
set to do research and discovery but
other things could happen if it&#39;s not
done properly for instance you not
getting a job because of some disease
you might have or you having a different
insurance rate because of some disease
you might have so the the thing about
data we have to think about is not
people going out to try and maliciously
do something wrong it&#39;s really the
unintended consequences that we have to
be concerned about now if at this point
you realize that what I&#39;m telling you is
that there&#39;s a spy in your pocket and
there&#39;s a spy in your house and just
about everything there is to know about
you is known you might just say oh I&#39;m
gonna just check out I&#39;m gonna throw
this on the Charles and I&#39;m not gonna be
part of this anymore
well that&#39;s not good enough because
we&#39;ve now have 28,000 licensed drones in
the United States no I&#39;m sorry 28,000
licensed pilots 550,000 drones 1,000
companies that are licensed to fly in US
airspace entities like the DEA the ATF
the FBI local law enforcement are also
flying these drones and if they fly up
at the observation deck of the Empire
State Building which is about a thousand
feet up and they have a 1080p HD camera
they can look at your face and they know
who you are they can recognize your face
for a thousand feet away you&#39;re not
gonna see them you&#39;re not gonna hear
them they can read the license plate on
your car so we are living in a state
that is more highly surveilled than any
time in history so what&#39;s the summary of
this I mean basically they know who you
are where you live where you work where
you play how much you make your gender
your age your marital status what you
like what you don&#39;t like what you&#39;re
shopping for your political leanings
your interests what you do for fun were
you dying they know where you are where
you go how far you drive
they also know probably where you&#39;re
going because looking we&#39;re habitual
people we have patterns every day you

know maybe you go to lunch at 1:00

o&#39;clock or 12:30 and you go to one or
four places they can maybe notify you
and say
instead of going over to Chili&#39;s why
don&#39;t you come over here to you know to
Applebee&#39;s I&#39;ll give you a 10% discount
so there&#39;s there&#39;s really valid uses for
all this data and a lot of companies are
well-intentioned and they want to use it
the right way but doesn&#39;t it make you
just a little bit uncomfortable that
this much information about you is in
the hands of corporations who are
supposed to be looking out for your best
interests I mean companies like this who
I think have the best intentions but
they make mistakes
Apple famously had their cloud hacked
and a bunch of celebrities were shocked
to find out their photographs are in the
wild Google has been listening to people
without them really knowing it AT&amp;T got
fined 25 million dollars for releasing
two hundred and sixty thousand records
incorrectly some individual at OkCupid
released 70,000 records of members with
username gender and sexual orientation
which is probably not a good thing
there&#39;s there&#39;s data scientists can look
at Facebook Facebook profiles and
determine what your sexual orientation
is which could be a really bad thing if
you are gain you live in Afghanistan
Qatar or Saudi Arabia or seven other
states because it&#39;s punishable by death
so we need to think about what this data
can do and not just the data about you
but what happens in the data about you
gets combined with all different other
types of data because that&#39;s what&#39;s
happening these gentlemen were part of
the Tuskegee Experiment there were 600
sharecroppers in Georgia 399 of which
had contracted syphilis this went on for
40 years in 1972 it was discovered that
the US health services were conducting
this survey to find out what happens
and even though penicillin was
efficacious in curing and treating
syphilis they didn&#39;t bother to hand it
to these poor gentlemen and it wasn&#39;t
just these men who suffered it was their
wives and children 40 years I bring this
up because this is what instigated the
development of the common rule the
common rule is what protects us every
day it&#39;s what guards clinical trials so
you have phase one which is basically do
no harm it&#39;s safety phase all
want to do is make sure that nothing
goes wrong in phase one of a clinical
trial do we have phase one for data and
the use of data do no harm is a really
really good mantra Facebook&#39;s mantra is
move fast and break things all right I
mean that&#39;s great if you&#39;re a 25 year
old hacker but if you&#39;re controlling the
fate of America&#39;s you know liberty and
privacy and you&#39;re saying go fast and
break things that&#39;s not exactly the best
way to go in my opinion so we believe I
believe that data is going to be misused
and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s gonna be misused
intentionally I think it&#39;s more than
likely going to be misused
unintentionally and we need to have an
adult in the room we need to have
somebody whose job is not to determine
how do we eat out a couple extra pennies
and earnings at the end of the quarter
we need to have somebody sitting there
and saying hey could this hurt somebody
is this going to affect a or a
population or a city or a school if we
release all this information to you know
ice or we could have a bunch of kids get
picked up and then sent out of the
country tomorrow yeah these are the
things we have to think about and what
has it got to be based on it&#39;s gonna be
based on doing the morally correct thing
ethics the difference between right and
wrong so we don&#39;t have data ethicists
yet they&#39;re just beginning and when I
spoke to the people at the future
privacy forum about this they told me
when I said what do we do about this
they said we don&#39;t know so I&#39;m gonna
encourage you to do something about it
and what I want you to do is I want you
to get educated I want you to know what
I know I want you to go to future
privacy forum the Electronic Frontier
the Center for Democracy and Technology
and just get up to speed about what&#39;s
being done with your data and what do we
have to do as citizens to protect
ourselves about things going wrong
because think about it we are more
highly surveyed today surveilled today
than in the history of the American
people Rosa Luxemburg
said and she was in 1800s activists in
Russia she said those who do not move do
not feel their chains
I think this is something we need to
move on thank you very much
[Applause]
