namaskara
are we see I&#39;m varun Tita from this very
college and it&#39;s an absolute privilege
to be here at this wonderful event I
thought we could start off on an
interesting flashback that will
eventually lead us to an unconventional
world with unheard possibilities On
January 10th 2017 I was selected to go
to Delhi and Chennai for the annual
World Book Fair where my work was
selected to be displayed
I met a 23 year old chap there who was
lean and quite introvert
he bought a bunch of books including
mine and stormed out of the stall like
there was no tomorrow to finish reading
all the pages a month hence I was taken
aback when I received a mail from the
same person I&#39;d read hey this is
so-and-so I loved your work and you know
what I have started to reciprocate a
relatable plot into my life so I go down
to the AI seus Indian Cancer Society
every weekend and play memory gumgum to
all the patients there in fact we have
our own bank and that is possibly the
best medication we as a team have had
until now this mysterious go-getter is
our Vaishnavi or C a graduate who was a
patient fighting cancer earlier this
year it wasn&#39;t easy for him as he was
going through severe depression and even
attempted to give up on his life several
times with only a few weeks remaining
for him was the book fair he decided to
motivate himself by searching for
material that would change his mind his
approach his way of looking through the
most difficult phase of life he began to
use his skills in the field of music the
Gellin with the other patients to create
this fear of hunger and optimism around
them tank or tank or tank or they would
proudly chant their team name day and
night as the musical notes would loudly
echo through the corridors of the ICS
office that is who they represent the
pawn in conquer replay
with the can from cancer I&#39;m sure there
are a few takeaways from this that made
you take notice and think all right well
the miracle of recovery or what was in
that book that brought about this
drastic change or maybe even on how
these coincidences became the strongest
element for them this year to be honest
with you I don&#39;t see the crux of this
turn around through either of these
options and all do they it&#39;s just how
the belief in someone to use his or her
potential to make a difference impacted
one to take notice and resonate on the
same to another to another to another
person until all these creative media
led to an avalanche of opportunities
perseverance and solutions these bunch
of extraordinary folks are just one
among millions who do can create
something special from the grassroots of
a skill set they love it&#39;s no illusion
that this idea of using our talents to
bring about a change can be the most
satisfying feed you can achieve I can
achieve we together and achieve when we
talk of discrimination and crimes based
on gender status sexuality beliefs and
so on the first thing that comes to our
minds on these lines are thousands of
members marching down the street with
large banners and slogans echoed with
utmost passion we all surely have that
voice a loud crisp and clear voice but
to channelize it and make that count
through an intriguing path so as to reap
results we have desired for years now
there lies an idea a roadmap a way of
life which uses out the individualistic
uniqueness we all possess sitting over
there right now you might have this
question at the tip of your tongue so
what he&#39;s trying to say is that my
passion for a change through a creative
medium can impact large volumes of
people really the foundation of this
idea he is trying to interpret is that
simple well not really not as
straightforward as it may seem putting
it that way
but yes it&#39;s nowhere close to impossible
either I&#39;m sure that you focus at the
moment is divided between the spotlight
here and your subconsciousness where
you&#39;re brainstorming are the simple
things you love doing on a daily basis
I&#39;m guessing many of you are thinking on
the lines of music dance theater
I heard literature literature and maybe
even writing yeah
finally there will be a few here too who
will say you know what forget purchasing
a passion meat operas in so for my
bitanga what about conga or football
Premier League a sorry matches their
conga bus I kid you not I was the same
chap during my childhood the one thing I
was crazy about as a couch potato back
in the day was to listen to the sports
commentary I picked up a lot from that
fake accents of course but the three for
doing so was always there earlier this
year when I visited a couple of shelter
homes I noticed that a group of
abandoned mentally challenged boys and
girls were playing cricket in the corner
of a grown over time I bonded with the
lads and got to know about their past of
child abuse and acid attacks which was a
very disturbing mind rod for them as
they would continue to play while
hooting and cheering I made sure I stood
behind a batsman and gave a commentary
in the background what a game this is
turning out to be and what a fantastic
audience we have gathered here today
just when he once we called from six
balls of the star player which news on
soy mauling or comes teeming with the
stroke washing rocker Bishnu cuts under
the ball who strikes a big how that goes
how low how low boom would you believe
it it&#39;s going all the way for a maximum
[Applause]
eventually as many volunteers joined in
for this practice it brought about an
amazing sense of belief that they
started to use sports and commentary as
a mechanism to look at their future in a
completely different dimension today six
to eight students are in the process of
being registered under the PCI training
program our Olympics Committee of India
that became the power of translating
talents roping in different individuals
into this common space of uncountable
opportunities and hence creating that
tandem of influence through just the
basic creativity that aim believe in the
scales definitely vary when we look at
scenarios that are possibly large and
sensitive but the very foundation to
make ourselves count pretty much remains
the same there is no restriction to aim
big even if it&#39;s something that&#39;s
causing ripples at the global level
recognize that situation the so-called
taboo of perception you believe you want
to turn fortunes in the right direction
and let us accept the actual influence
it has had on crumbling our society
researching and understanding the root
cause is important as we then have a
direction to toil hard and get ourselves
into a zone of solid clarity create
mental pictures in your mind as to how
you would want to shape your vision and
let us do patient if we don&#39;t manage to
achieve them at a brisk pace be bold to
fall back to references to people new
organizations who have already had some
experience with respect to the target
issue that&#39;s the best part of being a
change maker you only keep learning more
and more as you further progress change
then no wrong the law no longer remains
a phenomenon that happens when it&#39;s
supposed to happen rather it becomes a
way of life which can be adopted on
simplistic yet impactful terms this wise
idea of changing life through innovation
will only scale up in terms of the
thrust it has to change minds start off
with a message which would gradually
shape into a program an initiative a
practical solution to the cause and
hence the big picture we all come across
a range of topics through articles and
videos right but the one that personally
caught my eyes with the practices that
cost hey wok the girls during the time
of the month period discrimination or D
menstruation taboo as they call it to
start off with I was greeted with weird
expressions as to why on earth would i
guy take up something like this
eventually I came across an organization
who had thought provoked by a proposal
or the red drive with interesting
workshops involving students who were
victimized on these basis we managed to
document their stories and raging
opinions by this every such individual
was all said to be an example to their
peers through their field of interest we
could observe that most of the 12 to 16
year olds is not spending time with the
crayons and paint boxes that is when
they were assisted to express their
inner voice of resilience through the
form of art these works made them
realize the need of standing up for who
they represented and why bleeding should
be a matter of pride and not shame
another set of beneficiaries were
banished from homes to art lonely
menstruation huts they would secretly
cuddle in corners and draft verses of
their desires to end such impositions
with the few good musicians on board
compositions were created on the same
and that in turn showcased empowerment
to others that instantly caught their
attention
such was the effect that every victim of
this taboo began to stamp authority over
the patriotical practices in a zone of
absolute confidence and solace over a
thousand eco-friendly sanitary napkins
have been distributed to such heroes
across different schools and camps
notice how I coined them as heroes now
and not beneficiaries in fact we all
start to look at different communities
around us through a lens of
possibilities and capabilities once we
imbibe this out-of-the-box thought
process
recognized research create mental
pictures execute Network and there we
have the potential revolution you are a
part of from scratch the initial budget
or the reputation of the team they don&#39;t
really predetermine the pedigree of the
region do they draw the results may seem
wonderful over time every individual
continues to develop on the dynamic work
environment in order to make a
productive contribution to the world we
deserve that&#39;s what this ideology can do
it&#39;s infectious so infectious that
capital and social status don&#39;t really
drive where you&#39;re headed but the only
ingredient create that path of
successfully making a difference is the
belief in translating your skillset to
the big stage because until now we have
been looking at the brittle shadows who
are falling off the bridge of equality
and acceptance with hope that they
somehow find a way to climb back up if
the question still arises in your mind
as to can I should I then think again
whether there really is a need to ask so
you may hit the right cause if a guitar
every practice session you may love to
sing your heart out under a spotlight
you may create magic with the paintbrush
in a palette or you may even have an
unreal talent of shooting a goal from
hustling trust me every minut
accomplishment you take in your stride
can drop off a to people in a
thought-provoking manner hope walks
through fire while faith leaps over it
it&#39;s not a fancy saying that should be
preached rather it is a practical truth
that can be executed quite amazingly as
we inch closer and closer towards a
strong social stature the mortal to be a
part of this we don&#39;t have to rely on
any parameter as such rather it could be
the reason of something as simple as a
handshake mahi and saroja are two
transgender women I make me the signal a
few months ago as I gave her a warm
handshake before leaving she broke down
saying
after 29 years of changing sexual
orientation she finally met someone
outside the community who initiated a
conversation remember change is not a
phenomenon but a way of life roughly six
months forced the spark a student LGBT
Union has managed to create an image of
identity as a choice and sexuality as a
state of liberalisation using dance and
drama to be able to draw out optimism
and pride through such work becomes an
extension to the core understanding that
the very spirit and charisma of every
individual irrespective of their
community can be and should be
celebrated that&#39;s what sets you apart
and in turn sets us apart of spaces
which seemed ideal only until yesterday
if you believe that I am here on stage
because I have found myself many steps
ahead I wouldn&#39;t agree with you on that
because at the end of it most of you are
bound to ask me for the final piece of
this roadmap where will it finally end
fair enough that&#39;s fair enough
it could be the medium of sports or the
involvement with the rural kids or a
union with the queer community or maybe
even our collaboration in the near
future there you go the fortress of
faith if one would like to label it that
way pretty vague isn&#39;t it well observe
again think clear and now reinterpreted
you start off with one and believe that
it&#39;s unique in its own way
when dispersed among a pool of many
others your ought to observe that a few
more resonate on this friend and hence
such directions which opens doors to a
whole new dimension of thinking every
stage becomes an unprecedented extension
to the message you just believed in
that&#39;s the whole point when we all come
to the state of realization that we
alone are the author of asset there was
a start somewhere but never seems to be
a blueprint to reach an end and we never
will find one but the ultimate a
is to get somewhere close through a part
you believe in ladies and gentlemen
each one sitting beside you will have
their own approach but with the common
perspective of being a catalyst for
change through the unpadded caliber our
generation possesses believe construct
set the benchmark and come be a part of
the real where we are the possible and
impossible you have been a wonderful
audience till now
thank you so much
[Applause]
