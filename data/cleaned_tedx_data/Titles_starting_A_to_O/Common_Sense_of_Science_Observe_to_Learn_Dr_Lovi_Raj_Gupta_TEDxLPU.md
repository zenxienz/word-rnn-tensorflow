when you see a cricket ball then you
know there&#39;s a boiler there is a batsman
their self feet up maybe in terms of
wicket keeper or something like that and
then somebody called us enough I know
believe me if you observe this game on
any game each and every ball or have a
different mathematics because from the
bowler if all is leaving him and going
away from him but for a batsman point of
view the ball has left the baller and it
is coming on to the batsman some boob
tube visualized what kind of
mathematical difference would be it&#39;s
not just simply playing simple game and
you know for a wicket keeper it has not
this striking of the ball it is more one
can see that particular home so the
entire physics and the entire
mathematics of his observation
differentiates from that of one that&#39;s
been the batsman will have to come into
a life to strike the ball spring bearing
then always be a case condition an
opportunity of a baller that he will be
deceptive the continuity if you if you
study you know calculus then it up then
the containers you know theory of
continuity he&#39;s going to deceive that
continually either by a swimmer up by a
spin or by changing the pace of people
for the admirer he has to look to be
born at any given point of time and if
it strikes somewhere in the length you
have to take up office now these
biographies for all these four different
factors the observation is the only key
now if you if you start observing that
ball by D by they are striking the ball
then you become a better batsman
if you start visualizing the movement of
the ball in terms of one throwing it
creating at this
should become a better batsman and if
you start getting each and every one of
you could be changed the trajectory of
the ball you become it&#39;s also there&#39;s
one load of power of observation and
observation makes you live into a
particular subject discipline skill or
whatever so there are women of
mathematics which one is tell me what
are you what comes your mind when you
see the first blow that I have comes
into mind does the snake come to do
little by now there&#39;s only one specific
thing which comes into your mind because
you have lived with this logo you didn&#39;t
rank this level you didn&#39;t study this
logo you didn&#39;t learn this local you
live in this particular know what comes
into your mind when you are when you&#39;re
visualizing an object like this plain
and simple now if you are looking for
this particular diagram will I let them
into your mind
no because you haven&#39;t you haven&#39;t read
it you haven&#39;t studied the best example
of living into a thing is when you drive
nobody taught you driving there are no
classes conducted for driving they know
of course now the discs are there but we
all go there was not nothing you know
which happened related to read study
something related to learn but most of
the things and most of the times where
you are driving you are basically
believing on the observations which you
have see believe me if I if I go by the
theory if I were to put and there is a
truck going in front of you while you
are driving a car if you if you bring
all the pictures of dopplers effect or
relative
and things like that in order to decide
whether to overtake the truck or not
we&#39;ll take you at least 30 minutes to
decide whether to overtake or home which
you do not you do it in just nanoseconds
of microseconds and that is there my
point is that you start living is a
skill set he was talking about
fashionable guitars and everything when
you become somebody in playing that
guitar you never go to the springs you
never look to what your fingers where
they&#39;re going because you have started
living in that that can be both those of
example of living and then learning a
system from that a chef
never calculates that this much amount
of salt is to be put into a dish ask
your mother she never calculates that to
me she never pays one arms or 1.5 pounds
of material to be put in and she&#39;s the
best cook because she never something
like that that&#39;s another story but she
never studied or learned she started
living into it now for all of you might
take over there is why don&#39;t you start
deserving into your some sense it is
beyond reading it is beyond studying it
is beyond even learnings start living
into your subjects even if you&#39;re
programming there are the words of
observations around you which can teach
you programming there are work words of
happenings around you which even point
which you will correlate with any
subject of this world
thus you live it subject by just simply
your observations and believe me I are
basing your observation with a
correlation of the
basic concepts will change your life
because start seeing things differently
and you become a person living into a
subject rather than actually studying or
learning that particular subject I have
done this throughout my life and that is
what I wanted to present or put across
thank you very much
