good evening I think I am loud enough
right for the people at the back yes so
my name is Gaurav GL and I am 31
yes I understand a lot of people think
he like I&#39;m I look younger it&#39;s very -
achar samarium breakup attorney in
shelter and ok to be a question for you
guys what do you think X means over
there
Ted X now basically it&#39;s Ted anxiety you
understand so all the speakers who come
they should have a counselor here
because the anxiety it produces within
the speakers and moving on I would like
to share a story and I can&#39;t be more
narcissist because it&#39;s about me so I
would like to share some insights into
my own life which has made me realize
and why I stand here it&#39;s a long journey
so before I go into my childhood I would
like to start from say right after my 12
so I will always like animation as I was
a kid because everybody all the children
like cartoons right and so similarly I
was like this is the only thing I would
like to do and doing when I was in
eighth I realized this so when I was in
tenth I asked someone okay how do I
pursue animation somebody said okay buy
the software called 3d studio max so I
went to Delhi about what a pirated CD I
hope Autodesk doesn&#39;t sue me now but I
bought the pirated CD went back home
learned it so for next two years I
pursued that and after 12th I went to
Bombay I did my 3d animation course
wherein I realized ski this is they have
taught me a lot of software but what
about the knowledge the actual ABC of
animation and I&#39;d also got a job after
my 12th after this course and my sister
is an artist as well and she got through
NID also after doing her graduation from
Delhi College of Arts and she told me
this is a brilliant place for you you
should come here so I applied once I
didn&#39;t get through I realized why I
didn&#39;t get through so I applied again I
got through an ID and I joined and I had
the most
in time there I owe all my skills and
basically talents to that place and
right after my college when I was in my
final year had given my diploma done all
that I got offered from Walt Disney
because my friend was working there and
they said there is a job profile and you
suit the profile so you should try and
that one of time I had dreadlocks okay
so I applied for the job I got through
they cut my dreads after hiring me for
the same reason and what Walt Disney did
for me apart from all the TI I&#39;m
standing here because you guys seen me
on TV it&#39;s you know as seen on TV you
bought it and you brought me here if I
wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t on TV I possibly
wouldn&#39;t be here right but more than
that what wall doesn&#39;t he has done for
me is introducing me to children and for
me the only passion I had before this
was animation there was nothing else
there was army at some point of time
Indian Army I don&#39;t know how they are
related but because I am a pretty
accident prone guy so doctor said you
don&#39;t even try because you are pretty
much too taboo tousle they won&#39;t take
you so so what Walt Disney did for me
was they introduced me to children and
that was the most fascinating thing and
then actual my journey began because I
could relate that to my childhood and
after Walt Disney we shot for three
years and I realized I you need to work
in this field so I was working
independently for almost five to six
years conducting workshop across India
with children in different subjects and
then I realize I must have a company
because you know it has more credibility
and we were also a team now so I founded
thought symbols along with my partners
there was puja and sumit initially with
puja and so but I realized my limitation
also after forming the company because
one I love being a researcher and
content creator so being an entrepreneur
is it&#39;s not easy and also not the best
thing I like I would like to do in my
life I would rather be in the backstage
not stand here have a talk but be
somewhere create things test it out so
now now you have
overall overview of my journey and now
I&#39;m standing here right now I would like
to take you back to my childhood so if I
ask you what kind of personality do you
realize or do you imagine me being as a
kid knowing me seeing me on TV seeing me
now how I speak what do you think you
can create an imaginary personality in
your head right and I would like to say
I was a pretty wild kid I was untamable
you know very stubborn very free I
didn&#39;t need anyone to take care of me I
was out there playing mixing expired
medicine to see if maybe I&#39;m some magic
potion comes out or making my own crack
or burning my eyelashes on my hair and
[Music]
so I I was pretty much untamable and I
refused to study because I asked my
parents why should I study and nobody
could answer me see a child you can&#39;t
tell him though you will get a job and
you&#39;ll get based on you it&#39;s important
for an intellectual whatever development
a child will not understand that good
it&#39;s just some random words which
doesn&#39;t mean anything so I actually
refused to study so during exams what
used to happen was all my I had my elder
brother and my elder sister elder sister
so I am the youngest them and my father
and my mother everybody would be after
me to make me study and they would be
like with a poem and they&#39;re like
reciting so by the end of it my whole
family would remember everything my
whole post course structure but I would
not know anything I would literally
close my ears and refuse to study I was
that stubborn against education and so
once my I was sleep and my father is
like you know he&#39;s sleeping so let&#39;s
just dictate the course any of the years
maybe something goes in his some point
just because tomorrow is the exam okay
so they have been to that extreme also
so from I think I scored the highest in
my life in my nursery okay honestly
and then the graph goes down and then
something happens and the graph goes up
okay but I had a really I was almost
like I don&#39;t remember my school time
I remember everything outside but not my
school time one because I had my own
limitations as a child I did not
understand text it was the last thing I
would like to read is a text and I
wouldn&#39;t understand I had problems
speaking even now I do there sometime
and it comes now so I go like sir like I
can&#39;t speak properly and at the same
time God really forgot to install the
hard disk drive in my system which means
I only work with RAM okay
I can&#39;t store anything so if I&#39;m in the
now it&#39;s okay
and possibly I&#39;ll actually forget the
images from this talk as well it is
pretty extreme I&#39;ll remember the essence
of it I might remember myself from a
third person point of view because my
brain is trying to recreate the memories
which I don&#39;t remember from my own eyes
so the good thing is that I&#39;m always
it&#39;s the old past or old memories or all
Gayle the world friends they don&#39;t
trouble me anymore
if I am there I&#39;m there I&#39;m working and
I&#39;m totally dedicated because so these
three three problems which is the memory
part which also not unjust able to
understand text and now if you see so
I&#39;ll show you how okay this is
classified information all right okay so
the thing is if you see my grades from
class 1 to 5 like I told you notice Lee
was my golden era so my grades go
actually down till the fifth grade and
although the average remains more or
less like 55 something person but I&#39;m
flunking in some example like many of
the subjects
okay so this is the first grade all
right road number 20 91 92 were you born
then
so okay you see that pay attention to
the red marks okay and then you go to
the way should I point this okay okay so
slowly you see those B and F they&#39;re
three now and then it increases hope
increase to four five six seven eight
something like that okay and then it
increases to this is the fourth class
three is four five six seven eight like
uncountable stuff okay but also
interesting to see that Hindi language
literature is eighty and at the same
time 39-inch whistle studies I don&#39;t
know how it&#39;s that is happening and the
fifth grade was this alright I flunked
into I think English language there and
mathematics down there and the in the
middle over there you see that&#39;s I have
Photoshop because it was obstructing the
view so this is what I got in the fifth
grade
oh yeah so this says okay they didn&#39;t
mention my name
they were being polite I guess but he
has been if he doesn&#39;t show any
improvement in the week subjects by the
end of the next academic year he or she
will not be promoted to the next class
and please take this matter seriously
this is class v for God&#39;s sake okay
and I&#39;m like smart enough to remove the
headmistress name and the school name so
and you can see the where
okay so this is this is not nursery
nurse it would be up up there somewhere
okay so this goes down and then goes
down and this is where I get this
morning and then I would go to plus six
which would be around here and you see
the up this thing so what happened why
did I start studying because of the
trial that shit which was there I
couldn&#39;t read anyways I didn&#39;t like text
so it didn&#39;t make sense when I went to
the first day of my class of sixth grade
they our teacher she made a stand and
she asks us he who all got promoted on
trial basis so three of us stand up and
that was the most embarrassing time of
my life okay
standing up in the middle of the class
being pointed out I never want that even
now okay Who am I there okay so I got so
embarrassed that I&#39;m like good this will
this shouldn&#39;t happen ever I do not want
this to ever repeat and that&#39;s how I
forced myself to study so the grades
went up I&#39;m not like I ought break early
okay so they it goes slide they&#39;re still
like around about 65 something then why
do you think this happen over there and
this happened to hit the peak yeah so
which means because of the pressure and
now I know it would like because see I
took it upon she&#39;s decision to study
right and I also consciously know what
that boards they are important so just
before the exam I would study and this
is the board scum marks and if you see
my the prelims or whatever you call them
the rest of the exams I would be
flunking okay there so I would just
study for the boards and eleventh off
good days no board so like I didn&#39;t
study and like when twelfth his board so
I study again just for that I can make
my future somehow what worked for me was
one that I had a strong willpower which
means if I really think about something
I do it secondly I had awareness as well
which means when I was going through
when I didn&#39;t want to study it was a
conscious decision because nobody could
me why I should study when I wanted to
study again it was a conscious decision
that okay dude I have to do something I
don&#39;t want to be embarrassed again in
public and one was the most important
thing out of this is my parents I am
very lucky to have the best parents it&#39;s
a relative so for me there was a nice
mix of they gave us a lot of freedom
they never indulged and what we were
doing and they would not ask us much
maybe some children needed but I didn&#39;t
I was anyways free and I was happy with
myself so my parents were like my father
is a scientist was a scientist is
retired now and he was always in his
work so I don&#39;t think he will even know
what class I was studying in I mean
whether was super active working and
like helping everyone and a social
worker also and she still does if you
ask if you call my home and mother is
not there they will say over the jailing
jail may hang because there is a jail
near her house and she goes everyday
there to teach meditation and yoga to
the inmates of the jail so she has been
doing that forever now working with
children and so so one thing Chiefs to
tell us was we trust you and you are
responsible for your life all right
so that actually empowers a child a lot
more because one you know that they are
not they don&#39;t care what you do so you
are free to do anything and secondly
when they say they trust you and you are
responsible that dialogue somehow comes
at the crucial moment when you are about
to take some crucial decision and that
comes in and you like dude like oh we
are responsible for our own actions okay
okay so even if you go through then you
take the responsibility okay and that
gives you a lot of power when you take
responsibility and it applies to your
job or studies now or whenever anything
you do even if you don&#39;t want to do it
but if you have to do it then take
responsibility what&#39;s the point of doing
something insane a mission in which I
Bowl Arthur so I am doing it there is no
point of that either don&#39;t do it if you
are doing it then take responsibility
for what ever you do so parents is I
realized it&#39;s see education comes later
right but the child is spending time at
home
so parents have to form this a force
field around the child and if the child
knows that okay I have this support like
artillery and infantry with me that
nothing happens like anything because
the world is as you know we have a lot
of problems each one of us we have our
own unique problems and we&#39;ll keep
facing them our whole life so when the
world is also going to bombard you with
problems you don&#39;t want problem to exist
at home also that really will destroy a
child when he knows key okay the world
is also there were so many problem
coming in and my parents are also
doesn&#39;t and they don&#39;t understand me so
you the parents really have to form a
shield you can discipline your child at
home whichever way you want to you have
to be smart about it
but in public you have to defend your
child I&#39;m not saying like if he goes and
really hurts someone and you are like
named a debauch and a cuchini gear but
there has to be a way but parents they
should not want discuss the child like
the problems or the funny habits a child
has in front of him
don&#39;t do that don&#39;t embarrass the child
okay you should always imagine a child
as a complete being he is not like you
know when this kid is small and you like
googoo gaga like doing something making
stupid faces no he understands
everything okay
he like what the hell wouldn&#39;t Booga I
would like the because his neurons are
still developing muscles are still he is
like taking control of all that doesn&#39;t
mean that he doesn&#39;t understand things
all right so whenever you see a child
regardless of what age treat him or her
with respect and see through and treat
him like an individual okay talk
normally like you would to anyone like
to me like I&#39;m talking to you
when I would take workshop with children
I also like do the same thing I talked
to them naturally like you would because
when you distort your voice it&#39;s
confusing for children they&#39;re like what
the hell is it doing why we like talking
that squeaky voice that is not required
that&#39;s our interpretation of the
children in some weird way okay so
parents is like I said do not indulge in
their lives but be interested you have
to be interested in your child&#39;s life
and right now that you can say the
culture is that everybody wants one
button like solution Oh tell me
something that I buy and the child or he
is like spending too much time on
gadgets what do I do
oh maybe Flint Oh box arch into box
whatever you want to buy give it to him
it doesn&#39;t work like that you have to be
interested you have to improve yourself
go through things and then participate
in case your child is not very active
and going out so you have to be
interested at the same time not indulge
in his or her life then if you come to
education what is the whole core of
Education it is to empower lives right
but if if you see my report card and the
trial basis how the hell is that going
to work how is that helping anyone I
don&#39;t understand I truly feel in a
certain age you should let the child be
I would if it&#39;s up to me till 8th grade
okay then you can turn competitive and
whatever you want to but at least in
eighth grade
he should be exposed to a lot of things
I am an autumn aster you think a lot of
people think because of the show that
I&#39;m an artist and I paint and they
requested me to do something over here
if you take an average of the skill of
the artist in India I would be somewhere
average the same you report card you
solve like 54 percent I would be there
somewhere there n number of like
infinite number of people who are more
talented than me in terms of art but
that&#39;s not my power field my code field
I would say would be to simplify things
simplify knowledge and reach a core so
because I&#39;ve been self teaching myself
my whole life in my college luckily we
never had subjects like they never
should teach us something it all
everything was self taught and because I
couldn&#39;t understand the way they taught
in school so later in life I started
teaching myself
of how do I understand so I would go
I&#39;ll search I&#39;ll try to understand the
core and if you understand the core it&#39;s
almost like if you understand 1/3 you
understand all the trees and that
actually it&#39;s true to a certain extent
so so education I would say so that&#39;s my
current goal that because I had a
terrible time in the education sector
now I&#39;d like to simplify the whole and
it&#39;s not a easy task
obviously nobody will invite me I come
and change ICSC CBSE are nobody going to
do that of course but soon I would I
think I would be releasing some modules
of some programs that can maybe help and
of course it needs a continuous feedback
to improve it and honestly speaking
problem-solving is dynamic process you
have to keep working on it and at the
same time when if I am passionate about
children I would request you guys also
when you meet another child be conscious
of this fact what I just spoke about and
don&#39;t indulge but do try to help in
whatever way you can to make their life
simpler because the world may arrive
into now we have created it honestly so
you can&#39;t blame them for being like
dabbing or like you know being too much
on Facebook because we created that
platform for them and they haven&#39;t seen
their platforms which existed before so
it doesn&#39;t make sense to blame them for
such stuff and they are the generation
they should use their tools of course
why not
the only thing is balanced that to
strike that balance you need to do our
bit and so we have covered the education
and we have covered the children and
parents yes so I think I would like to
end now and by ending I would just like
to say that please see children as the
first citizens of the world which they
truly are all right ok thank you
