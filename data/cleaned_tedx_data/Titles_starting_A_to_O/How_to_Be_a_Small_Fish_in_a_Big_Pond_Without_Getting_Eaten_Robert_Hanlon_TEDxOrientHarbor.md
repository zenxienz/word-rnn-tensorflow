this is a tale about how a small
community insists on being heard ramps
up the political discourse and help
shape its own destiny
who are we we&#39;re orient we&#39;re the end
next stop Portugal with the tail of the
dog we&#39;re a hamlet in the channel South
hold about 750 people out of about
22,000 about 5 square miles out of 54
we&#39;re older than the rest of the town on
average 58 compared to 48 in the town as
a whole our buildings are older two out
of three hundred historically preserved
buildings in all of South hold about 150
half of them are in orient when we&#39;re
rural in the rest of the town and we
have more preserved land than the rest
of the town we&#39;re less commercial we
have one full-time store a few part-time
stores a service station and a few
trades people this is our downtown we
are different not so much but enough we
vote a little differently we&#39;re gay or
than the rest of the town and we are our
own unique little community what do we
want we want what everyone wants we want
our interests recognized our needs met
our values preserved how do we get that
well we don&#39;t get to decide directly we
don&#39;t have a legislative body the
nearest legislative body is the town but
we don&#39;t have direct representation on
the town board nor on the Planning Board
nor the board of trustees nor the Zoning
Board we have to depend that the
at-large representatives elected
primarily by the 21250 other residents
of Southold
will look out for our interests hmm we
do have a civic organization the
organization Oh ay OH ay is a 501 C 3
not-for-profit organization educational
not religious not political our primary
purpose is to bring information to the
community of or
about issues that are critical to its
well-being what does OE do well we
witness we try and go to every town
board meeting that has an issue that
affects orient we go to the Planning
Board meetings the Zoning Board meetings
the Historic Preservation Commission
meetings and we watch and we listen we
don&#39;t speak much because we don&#39;t take
positions on individual issues in
general unless they have a broad
community impact and our members have
weighed in on it
but we&#39;re there and the commissioners
get to know us and we think our presence
makes a difference we think they&#39;re more
thoughtful and more careful because
we&#39;re there we sometimes fight the Orion
Association was founded in the 1980s
when there was a plan to bring dense
housing to our small community there was
strenuous objections we fought the plan
the plan was abandoned we fought again
when there was a plan to bring a major
water main project here because that
seemed to signal more density for this
Hamlet that the community didn&#39;t want
that plan also died a transportation
committee came up with an idea to have
massive trucking come through our Hamlet
they were going to reduce traffic on the
New England Thruway and instead put it
on our single two-lane road in Orion and
they were going to have bigger trucks
and more of them we fought this the plan
was abandoned a congressional committee
came up with an idea to have 750 condos
on Plum Island we&#39;re the path to Plum
Island this would have crowds and
traffic and overwhelm our infrastructure
we screamed the town listens and the
town came up with a zoning plan that we
hope would yet to be seen but we hope
will help keep Plum Island in its
natural state recently the state decided
without consultation with our Hamlet or
with the town to put massive traffic
signs on again on our little two-lane
road leading people know where
advertising nothing we how the
politicians joined us the signs came
down
but we are not primarily a lobbying
group we&#39;re not a legislature mostly
we&#39;re educational we reinforce our
tactical issues we&#39;ve been doing here
this is not the big long-term issues
that we often face we know how to put
out a fire we know how to wage war do we
know how to create methods to deal with
those slow changes those things that
reshape our community possibly in ways
that we don&#39;t care for do we know how to
wage peace what we needed was a big
long-range plan something strategic well
the town is already working on a
strategic plan they&#39;re holding meetings
they&#39;re inviting people in and many from
worrying have gone and we participated
and spoken up a good deal at these
meetings the town of South South holds
moving in a pretty good direction but it
doesn&#39;t necessarily cover the exact and
specific needs that this hamlet needs so
we began to have meetings a few people
started to get together and three became
six and six became a dozen and then 30
and then a hundred and thirty talking
planning meeting trying to figure out
what orient needs what we are what we
love and what we&#39;re going to be there
were many many ideas and complaints and
issues that people raised in these
meetings when people raised these kinds
of concerns it generally falls into
three categories the broadest are
feelings I won orient to be just the way
it was when I was a kid even if my
idyllic memory is not really accurate or
that the most specific is I don&#39;t want
to see any fences or any hedges on any
road in Orient
do these approaches work are these
really the broad values that we have to
try and pursue no neither of them lead
to success the first is much too broad
and vague it means different things to
different people
and it doesn&#39;t lead to any particular
action the latter is much too specific
and too personal it doesn&#39;t take into a
the needs of others farmers may need
fences to help take care of deer some
people love hedges and we&#39;re committed
to trying to represent the broadest
community interests not just a subgroup
so we have to go for a middle-level
a policy based approach not platitudes
not procedures so we talk these things
through and we try to figure out what
kept coming up over and over and what
people wanted and what was likely to
lead to something that could be
implemented we came up with 9
propositions in four major areas I&#39;m not
going to go through the whole set of
propositions you can see them on our
website the four main areas were
building in land-use traffic
agriculture and pest control and water
quality these are the things that kept
coming up and these issues really were
it seemed like we might get a consensus
on some of them I&#39;m gonna give you one
example of an issue that came up people
in Oriya kept saying we don&#39;t want to
end up like the some of the Hamptons we
don&#39;t want our small housing to be
dwarfed by hulking McMansions crowding
out neighbors until the neighbor sells
to the next hedge fund mogul and he puts
up a behemoth and then there goes the
neighborhood people didn&#39;t want that so
we had a proposal that said housing a
new construction or renovations in
housing has to be in scale with the
other housing in the neighborhood a
policy not a procedure as to how to do
it not just we don&#39;t like big houses but
something that would lead us to
something we could agree upon so we had
these great ideas how do we get a sense
of what the what oregan feels about it
even a hundred people talking is not a
whole community we created a ballot the
ballot would allow people to vote
individually on each proposition and
then we sent out over a thousand letters
we had 400 people on our mailing list
who got multiple mailings we asked other
organizations to send out to their
members as well we had ads and
newspapers and several stories ran as
well we then created a paper ballot that
could be voted on on
paper or by mail we got responses over
three hundred and sixty people answered
the ballots that&#39;s more than half of the
eligible voters in Orion we had over a
hundred people give us detailed comments
so we had a huge response on something
that didn&#39;t elect officials didn&#39;t raise
lower taxes it wasn&#39;t the kind of thing
that drove people to the polls and yet
we got a great response okay we got the
responses
how many yes responses do we get how
many favorables and what level would we
need in order to say this is the will of
Orion
this is something that we can go to the
town authorities and say these ought to
be implemented we weren&#39;t sure what
level of support would justify a
statement like that sixty percent
seventy seventy-five we thought we&#39;d get
strong support for some propositions but
we didn&#39;t know how much and how many as
it turned out it didn&#39;t matter every
proposition got at least four out of
five of the Orion stakeholders
responding in favor of that proposition
one of them getting a ninety two percent
support rate we wanted to hear from
orient Wow
Orion speaks and with nearly a unanimous
voice so we now have these ideas these
things that the Orion community says
that it wants what&#39;s next how do we make
it happen
well we told the community we told the
town the results of this meeting we then
form committees in the four major areas
to try and work with town officials and
other experts so we could try and put
together plans to get from what we
wanted to how to do it to how to
implement it and we now have that we are
now having those committees begin to
work with town officials and other
experts to help us get to something that
can be actually implemented well the
town go along we don&#39;t know for sure
perhaps the town will let us have
certain policies and procedures that are
applicable to our small community
perhaps the town will decide to
implement some of these policies for the
whole community
perhaps the town will talk and meet and
dither and do nothing any differently we
don&#39;t know for sure but we&#39;re going to
find out this community meets informs
each other advocates and fights and we
know how to do it in a disciplined and
controlled way when we when when the
Orion community speaks the town the
county and the state do listen when we
call up a meeting and ask people to come
out they show up in numbers far greater
than in other Hamlet&#39;s and in the town
as a whole we invite politicians to our
meetings and they come and I see one or
two of them here tonight the press
follows what we do we&#39;re going to
continue to watch to inform and to work
toward the goals of what the Orion
community wants but we&#39;ve already
accomplished a great deal
hundreds of people have come out and
been involved in this process
talking debating listening to what this
community wants to be we&#39;ve had more
than half the adult population actively
working on designing plans for the
future of Orion and we will continue to
inform to lobby to work together this is
now a better informed better engaged
community than it was in the past and
our community votes we&#39;ve already won
thank you
you
