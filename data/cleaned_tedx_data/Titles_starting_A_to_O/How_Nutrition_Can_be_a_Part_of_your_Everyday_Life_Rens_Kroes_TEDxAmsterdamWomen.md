what am i interest a topic of a great
debate is something that can change your
life have in common that is nutrition my
great-grandfather he was an amazing
Baker and he made the most delicious
food the Mason delicious sourdough
breads and also pastries my granddad he
had an organic farm and he chose organic
in the sixties in the 70s because he
thought that it was better for the soil
the crops and also for the humans and
the animals he was pretty ahead of his
time
this was my granddad mm-hmm it was a
newspaper from 1970 he was pretty ahead
and he was also pretty like a hipster if
you can call it he did already yoga in
the 70s and the 80s and he inspired me a
lot so this is my grandmom and she
thought everything that my mother offers
contains all the vitamins and nutrition
that my button that our body needs so my
mom grew up in that kind of environment
very aware and my dad got inspired as
well so my sister and I we grew up in
the same kind of environment very
conscious and I think this is what
happens when you normalize a topic like
nutrition way of it&#39;s a way of life
it creates awareness and it becomes
unconscious a part of your lifestyle so
it becomes normal
so as a result I started working in an
obesity clinic and I made my website and
after that I did courses and had my own
practice and wrote four cookbooks so I
was thinking it&#39;s so normal for me so
why shouldn&#39;t I say
with everybody but everyone has a
different opinion about healthy food
because what is it you have a different
opinion about it
you have a different opinion about it
Emmy - I think that healthy food is our
Whole Foods and unprocessed food that
makes your body happy so when I say
whole I mean eating food that still
looks as a kid growing in nature are
very close to it so food that and not
has been messed with or minimally messed
with so when I say happy I think that
it&#39;s eating variety of food that gives
you the nutrition you need to maintain
your health feel good and have energy
this is where I grew up this is a nice
garden this is me right now so but what
is the right way and why does this
matter it prevents diseases you get more
energy you sleep better it clean better
to a better performance of your mind and
body so you become more happy and
overall a better quality of life and who
doesn&#39;t want that right everyone wants
that so but like I said what is the
right way there are three elements which
I think that are important to start
eating healthy and there are create
awareness quality over quantity and also
being positive talking about create
awareness I always think it&#39;s really
good to have a clear and honest picture
what you eating so what I usually do is
to go to the grocery store and look at
the ingredient list what you can do is
just make a food schedule for just one
week and just after that you can just
look and see what you&#39;ve been eating so
awareness I think that&#39;s really
important and then you have quality over
quantity everyone knows that quality is
better
so it gives you the best nutrition an
enormous tree that is positivity when
I&#39;m cooking I enjoy it I love it I dance
in a kitchen and just have fun with my
friends and cook with them I think those
things are so important don&#39;t look at
the that you can but you can&#39;t eat but
look at what you can eat so look at the
don&#39;t look at the don&#39;ts so just have
fun and just be flexible and I think
balance is also a key so but why aren&#39;t
we do this if it sounds so easy I mean
we all have those resources everyone
it&#39;s called time money and support let&#39;s
talk about time I mean you probably
think that I have the best all the time
in the world to cook of course but I
still need to plan and when I&#39;m on the
road
I make sure I always have my food
prepped so but what I&#39;m trying to say
I&#39;ll make time so what I always suggest
to everyone else is that you should just
make the time it should be in your
healthy lifestyle so and then money when
I grew up I didn&#39;t really have that much
money
my parents were had like four jobs
sometimes and my mom drove and my dad as
well 20 kilometres to go to the healthy
store to buy something because he
thought it was better for us so what I&#39;m
trying to say is we didn&#39;t really have
as much but you made the priority to eat
healthy and then I&#39;m a three is support
set up an environment that works for you
instead of against you make sure you
create people around you that you
that understand you be very oh that that
are very open-minded I think that number
tree I think that is really important as
well so focus on that you have people
that support you that understands you
so if it&#39;s not a priority
eating healthy what is it&#39;s a choice and
it&#39;s about setting priorities with a
little bit commitment your focus will
start to become contagious you just want
to keep on going you just like yeah I
feel great it&#39;s so amazing and what
looks in the beginning like a mountain
will shift to a hill and then you
realize it&#39;s like flat lands and you
think like wow it&#39;s never been a
mountain but it&#39;s a mindset 70% of the
today&#39;s diseases our lifestyle related
based on everyday choices we make you
have the power to change this what
choices will you make thank you
