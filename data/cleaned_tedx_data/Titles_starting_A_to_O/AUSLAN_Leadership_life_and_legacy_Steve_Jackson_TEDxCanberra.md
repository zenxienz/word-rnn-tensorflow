I&#39;d like to take you back to 1960 I&#39;d
like you to remember what might have
been happening in your life in 1960 the
6th of December to be precise 826 a.m.
it&#39;s a cold winter&#39;s morning in South
Yorkshire and a little mining village
called one well and if you can visualize
a two up two down terraced house like
you might remember seeing on Coronation
Street and in the front room of that
house a new life was born in a in a
galvanized tin bath in front of an open
coal fire the son of a coal miner called

Steve Jackson was born at 8:26 a.m. on
the 6th of December 1960 that was me
they started my life that&#39;s been
incredibly rich with opportunities and
challenge and crisis sadness and
happiness and it has that however taken
a significant life event for me to
reflect on how I want to close that life
what do I want to be remembered for what
do I want my legacy to be if you&#39;re a
numerologist you&#39;re just going six
twelve 1960 that guy&#39;s life path will be
denoted by the number seven it&#39;ll become
the searcher and the seeker of the truth
it will be focused on analysis awareness
and understanding the search and the
seeker of truth it became quite true
because in January 1984 our join the
Australian Federal Police here in
Canberra I became a detective searching
and seeking for the truth but this isn&#39;t
about to become Steve&#39;s ten golden rules
about how to be remembered as the son of
a coal miner who did good it&#39;s not about
that it&#39;s not about to become a
rendition of Monty Python&#39;s the life of
Brian remember that classic that classic
line well it&#39;s simple really try to
avoid eating fat read a good book try to
take a walk every now and again
and remember to be kind to everybody of
all Creed&#39;s and Nations I&#39;ll let others
talk about Monty Python this is about my
story and it&#39;s about my story that&#39;s
been punctuated by the need to focus on
personal resilience we&#39;ve seen 38 years
in my career I&#39;ve really worked on how I
can make a difference I&#39;m a leader I&#39;ve
never been a good bridesmaid I&#39;ve really
never been a follower I&#39;ve always wanted
to be in the crucible of conflict in the
field leading people but to do that it
takes resilience and it took an event
last year for me to focus on what all
that meant so as I say a few words this
morning I&#39;d like you to think about what
your journey might have been what&#39;s your
legacy so mine started in earnest in
September 1979 I became the son of a
coal miner after being told you can&#39;t do
this I joined the Royal Navy as a young
as a midshipman and then my career
progressed into when I emigrated to
Australia into the Australian Federal
Police been involved is from wonderful
opportunities as the operational command
of his the Sydney 2000 Olympics
supporting the New South Wales Police
and I was incredibly humbled to have the
opportunity to be the field commander
and the lead investigator in the Bali
bombings in 2002 working with some other
incredible people many of whom were came
burned and then of course my current
role is the global chief of security for
Qantas but the most telling point that
really starts to ground truth my legacy
was the role I played in Bali because
people who suffer acts of terrorism
seldom have a voice and on that fateful
night in October as a result of two bomb
blasts when 202 people died including 88
Australians and many hundreds if not
thousands people were injured and
affected in some other way
there needed to be a voice the role of
me as the field commander my team was to
help with that voice to work with the
Indonesian police and hunt down those
responsible like the animals they were
and bring them to justice
and that&#39;s exactly what we did but
throughout all of that and throughout
some other challenges in recent years
you need to tap into as I found and I&#39;ve
referred to this this saying as a
personal reservoir of resilience you may
often feel that you don&#39;t have that you
know you feel sometimes when you&#39;re
dealing with adversity how am I going to
get out of this trough I&#39;ve got no hope
everyone has a personal reservoir of
resilience my legacy is to try and and
provide a voice based on my experiences
what&#39;s worked for me it&#39;s not gonna work
for everybody what&#39;s worked for me to
help people unlock this resilience is
something we hear every day but what is
it well simply port resilience is about
dealing with adverse events dealing with
life as close to normal as you can while
facing an adverse event or events it&#39;s
something in my view that is not a gift
of nature
you must nurture it like any other
personal attribute you have to feed it
you have to know it&#39;s there you have to
know what food to give it you have to
know how to tap it and unlock it and
make it work for you because when you&#39;re
failing at you&#39;re facing adversity often
people have got no idea no hope about
how to deal with it people like me
who&#39;ve been incredibly lucky who are
strong and resilient have a role to play
in helping people unlock their
reservoirs of resilience
the life event I referred to earlier
visited me in April last year when I was
diagnosed with high grade stage 4 lung
cancer that spread into my liver now
looking at me I don&#39;t look like somebody
who&#39;s suffering from a terminal illness
that I have a primary tumor in my lung I
have a malignant pleural effusion fluid
in my lung I have nine tumors in my
liver the largest measuring 6
centimeters by 5 centimeters that will
kill me so yet another adverse event but
most importantly where&#39;s the resilience
that&#39;s going to help me get through on
this this absolutely focused and
accelerated my drive to work out and an
advocate my legacy because there&#39;s a
start of my journey as a cancer patient
I saw people who felt they had no hope
and what&#39;s called an alkie it&#39;s a rare
genetic mutation I&#39;m the beneficiary of
cutting-edge cancer research
I take chemotherapy twice a day my
disease this week I&#39;ve been in hospital
a couple of days this week my disease is
progressing regrettably but we get out
of the corner I&#39;m not going to suck my
thumb I never have I never will but many
people feel they have no alternative and
it&#39;s my and I&#39;m never going to start a
foundation I&#39;m not going to raise a
million dollars but I am a big person
with a big voice and my legacy is to
promise to do what I can to allow others
to have a voice but to do that I&#39;ve got
to develop a couple of golden rules a
couple of waypoints about how I can put
markers in the ground for the rest of my
life one of those golden rules is to
give yourself options those who feel
despondent feel they have no options
yeah find some time either alone or with
support to lay out forensic ly the
options you have the good bits and the
bad B
and then work out what you can do to
deal with the bad ones but only control
what you can control it&#39;s a little like
the sword of Damocles isn&#39;t it the Greek
ode of the sword we&#39;ve all got a sword
of Damocles it&#39;s called life the sword
starts to hang the minute you&#39;re born
often it&#39;s large and often it&#39;s got a
very sharp point but for some of us the
thread is thin but for some of us people
like me who have the opportunity is to
thicken the strand I can&#39;t remove the
sword where I can strengthen the strand
that suspends it to stop it dropping
sooner than what it normally would it&#39;s
about coping mechanisms it&#39;s about
developing routine it&#39;s about setting
yourself a path a playbook for how you
want to lead the rest of your life I
found for me it&#39;s about being sincere if
you feel you want to make a difference
because you&#39;ve all been around long
enough to know that when people with a
voice take the stage a lack of sincerity
is something that the first thing to
shine through so if you want to make a
difference then have the courage to
stand up and be counted
but if you feel that you don&#39;t have that
as part of your DNA you can still make a
difference by helping others by being
there as part of a person&#39;s social
support mechanism whether as a cancer
sufferer or as a cancer patient as a
cancer a carer for those with cancer or
any other adverse life event recently I
have been asked by the lung Foundation
to become one of their ambassadors a
spokesperson not to be involved in
philanthropy yeah I&#39;ve got a big brand
beyond me
yeah sure I work for a fantastic company
it has been
wonderful in its support and we are a
philanthropic company but this is about
my voice this is about my story having
been connected that can help others
without the voice take that forward the
lung foundation isn&#39;t just about people
with cancer it&#39;s about what people with
lung disease my grandfather died of coal
miners pneumoconiosis my father COPD so
it kind of it kind of fits so I see that
as a very very important part of my life
to to now move off the field of play I
don&#39;t need to move onto the crucible of
conflict anymore I&#39;m not going to put my
black overalls on anymore
and jump into battle with my my
co-workers and fight the good fight I&#39;m
I&#39;ve become more of a coach or a mentor
for people who are at the start of the
journey that&#39;s what my legacy can be in
my professional life but also my private
life now I&#39;m suffering dealing with some
medical challenges the overarching thing
about my desire to provide a voice
particularly for those with lung cancer
is the stigma I wish I got a dollar for
every time somebody says every day I can
guarantee someone will say but you look
so well and I never knew you smoked and
for those of you that know somebody that
suffering lung cancer you&#39;ll know what
I&#39;m talking about it does become quite
annoying but lung cancer kills more
people than breast cancer bowel cancer
and prostate cancer put together but
attracts a fraction of government
funding so my job is to be an advocate
to try and get a level playing field to
give people a voice for those people
like you word earlier who don&#39;t know
what to do I&#39;m lucky
sure I started off in poverty I was born
into poverty but I&#39;ve been very very
lucky and I intend to to create an
environment to allow others and myself
and my family to realize a benefit from
my incredibly lucky journey throughout
all of that it&#39;s about developing a
thing that&#39;s very important it&#39;s a
desire to win and a will to survive when
I was in hospital this week I was in a
mixed ward doing the triage stuff and
the lady an elderly lady in the bed
across from me was Betty from Tamura and
Betty had been in the hospital quite a
few times she&#39;s quite despondent and
she&#39;d given up because her family hadn&#39;t
visited for three weeks all Betty wanted
was somebody to talk to somebody to help
her try and bring back a little bit of
that desire to live so I said to Betty
three simple things Betty
look up aim up never give up it&#39;s always
going to be somebody here to help you
it&#39;s just that you may not know who that
person or those people might be until
tomorrow but never give up never give up
remember Henry Ford and reforged said
remember when things are tough think
about an aeroplane what does an airplane
do it takes off into the wind it never
takes off with the wind behind it
so in closing think about the voice and
think about your legacy thank you
[Applause]
you
