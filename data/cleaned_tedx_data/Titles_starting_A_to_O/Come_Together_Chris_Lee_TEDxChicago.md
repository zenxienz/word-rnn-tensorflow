overtime are you doing okay
yeah yeah all right so um thank you for
being here thank you for having me today
this is my friend BJ he&#39;s gonna be
playing with me today
so I wrote this song and it&#39;s called
coming together
um coincidentally and I wrote this
specifically for this beautiful event
and it really only works well if I have
just a minimal amount of crowd
participation right so what I&#39;m gonna
have you do it&#39;s very simple call a
response any time I sing the words come
together you&#39;re just gonna sing them
right back to me is that alright today
is that okay so if I say come to gather
come to try yeah come to gather come to
yeah y&#39;all are like a choir in here yes
is got sectioned out this is beautiful
all right thank y&#39;all so much okay oh no
[Music]
it&#39;s amazing fabric could you see the
same old song something crazy happens we
get set and everyone goes on but I can&#39;t
take it I&#39;m not trying to blame nobody
else I&#39;ve been shaking cuz we&#39;re all
about ourselves we stand and pledge
allegiance for just this live
and when we don&#39;t see justice we decide
to take me and now a lot of us get upset
while other folks agree and it&#39;s a
never-ending cycle we&#39;re distracted as
the nightfall
but this one big man I know just like
Aerosmith and Michael said we gotta come
to gether
then everybody&#39;s they come together
you will feed only sakes you and me it
change it up if we come to there are
people and they&#39;re looking for the love
it cannot find we&#39;re all equal right so
what do we continue to be vibe wealth or
eco I can&#39;t seem to get a mop up my G B
G Q I see you know I live a privileged
life I pledge allegiance but justice and
liberty and when I don&#39;t see justice I
decide to take it me
and now a lot of us get upset while of
the folks agree and it&#39;s a never-ending
cycle we&#39;re distracted as the night
falls but there&#39;s one thing that I know
just like ever Smith and Michael said we
gotta come to gather yeah you know it
now jump - hey
see it only takes you and me to change
it up if we come to yeah okay okay they
want me to go slay take a minute to
position my image with no shame put a
mirror to political figures that chose
Fame over clinical ambition they clear
up the whole game a miracle my lyrical
visions and folks change I see the fish
and killing us innocents won&#39;t hang
can&#39;t spark a hand as long as we fear
but a head start from sad talks is so
real I pledge allegiance for justice in
and when I don&#39;t see justice I decide to
take me now a lot of y&#39;all get upset
while up before Sabri but it&#39;s never in
a cycle and we&#39;re distracted as the
night falls
but there&#39;s one thing that I know just
like every bit and Michael said we gotta
come
