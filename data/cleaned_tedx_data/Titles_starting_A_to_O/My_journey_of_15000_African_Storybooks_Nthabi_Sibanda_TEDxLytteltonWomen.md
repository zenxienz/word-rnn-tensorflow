my story or my journey rather of 15,000
African storybooks started 13 years ago
when my children were babies and at the
time it was actually a no-brainer for my
husband and I that we would speak to
them in our African languages it was one
of those decisions as as parents that we
didn&#39;t even have to discuss it was
actually just seamless in in how we did
it so in doing that then we said okay we
want to speech them in our African
languages because for us that was an
important connection to who they are as
Africans it was important in terms of
the identity it was important in terms
of the culture it was important in terms
of their sense of pride so armed with
this decision we then went about
speaking in our African languages now
the dynamic with us is that my home
language is the Soto and his is some
dead end so you can imagine then how
people around us our parents included
thought okay you&#39;re just gonna confuse
our grandchildren like what are you
doing but we put on our academic hats on
and did a lot of research and realize
that actually this can be done and after
all your average South African adult is
bilingual or trilingual so why can&#39;t we
then just pass this on to our children
as well so we were very determined to do
this because as you know language is
inextricably linked to culture so we
thought you know what
English is a given as a middle-class
black person they are going to learn
English but what about our languages and
the culture that comes with that
so we soldiered on and wanted to then
support this decision with story books
toons videos anything that can then just
fit in seamlessly with our busy
lifestyles so off we went to the local
malls to look into to to book stores to
look for this material you can imagine
them walking in to this space into this
bookstore where from floor to ceiling
you&#39;ve got books galore you&#39;ve got
different genres you&#39;ve got different
sections it is just packed with books
but when you look around you don&#39;t see
yourself as a black person represented
and this was very problematic because
one we know that we&#39;ve got all those
stories we know that Africa is filled
with stories but somehow growing up you
know about the Roman Empire and the
Vikings but you don&#39;t know about Queen
Sheba and Maupin go way and and Timbuktu
you know about the Loch Ness monster but
you don&#39;t know about Yami Yami the
mythical water god of Musa watry Nia who
the Europeans call Victoria Falls by the
way so it was very frustrating getting
into this space where we know that from
a Content perspective that is definitely
something that we are not missing but
somehow when you translate that into
what&#39;s available in our spaces there is
a gap there and more than just about the
content
it was also then about what does a story
actually do we must not underestimate
the power of a story a story can be
inclusive it can show you visually just
that I matter because these people look
like me they come from my context it
resonates but it can also at the same
time tell you that
you don&#39;t matter it can exclude it can
then tell you time and time again before
you even get into the actual story just
looking at the visuals it can tell you
that actually you don&#39;t belong or as we
like to say in South Africa you&#39;re not
stealing you&#39;re not the main person
right so then for us then I just found
this very puzzling and when I did the
research at the time I found that only
17% of of stories are in African
languages only 17% that included all the
genres so not just the children so once
you get to children it was even smaller
less than that and I found that then
this was actually very puzzling because
we are actually missing a big
opportunity to deliberately empower our
children through the images that they
see and through the languages in which
they read their books and it&#39;s also very
it was also very puzzling for me in
terms of the educational piece as well
that the Department of Education and the
Department of arts and culture could do
so much more in terms of getting those
stories into that space I&#39;m happy to say
though 10 years later there&#39;s a lot that
has been moved in in that arena but the
other thing that was also very important
was that if we are then going to make
sure that our children understand who
they are the story is also very powerful
from a sense of imagination when you
read a book you locate yourself in that
book you you you learn from that book
you wanna you want to be able to like
the hero and heroine in the book be able
to then think believe that you can do
anything you want to do and be anything
that you want to do so when we&#39;re
building up our children to then take
over and and build this economy and come
up with local solutions
and be the the innovators and and the
the inventors and the entrepreneurs of
of Africa then by by the stories that
were telling them when they still
excluded and alienating were actually
doing the opposite
so with this then in mind I had this
crazy idea that I&#39;m gonna change the
situation yeah so what about I mean so
we started out then by saying okay let&#39;s
start out with the content that we have
so looking at the content we then had
Lula and level stories that we created
it was very important in terms of the
images that we used Luna whose full name
is Lu Lama and which is a person name
which means meek and soft-spoken but
trust me Lula is anything but that then
there&#39;s laybourn LeBeau han which means
to give thanks and to be thankful her
younger brother so these stories then
went around these two characters and we
also then wanted to make sure that her
hair is something that children can
relate to you know the tone of their
skin is something that other children
can relate to and mind you when we said
that we&#39;re going to put them on the
cover we had quite a few people telling
us that no one&#39;s gonna buy a book with a
black child on the cover 15,000 books so
[Applause]
so we went about creating these these
story books we also very deliberately
created them in a urban setting again
we&#39;ve got different contexts
it&#39;s not just one side of the story or
the narrative that that I have seen and
then in addition to that we then saw how
can we infuse our African culture into
these stories so simple things like
greeting very important in African
culture the so the storybook shopping
day is actually a to teach children how
to greet and different ways of greeting
and the fact that when you enter a room
you must acknowledge the other person
and if you think about it in so subtle
the way that we agree to say hello you
would say okay or the guy which actually
means where are you to which the
response is getting I am here in this
Azul is Sal born I see you
so it&#39;s deeper than just okay yes we&#39;ve
got our casual ways of saying it but
it&#39;s deeper and and I think that must
not be missed in terms of the importance
of why we say when you enter a room you
acknowledge a person because you&#39;re
saying I see you how where are you I am
here and how we then as a society gonna
start to understand one another
if you can&#39;t even acknowledge my
presence so that was the rule and there
were series and in addition to the
ludendi boosters and the many adventures
that they went on as a family we also
then did a folk tale series a folk tale
sorry called how the line got its wrong
with oh man clean and prepare the queen
of of storytelling was internationally
renowned as a storyteller that was also
another really wonderful thing to be
able to work with her but also the
support that we got from the from the
essay book development council in
addition to to that kind of support
we also got international support
recognition we got approved by the
Department of Education Department of
Arts and Culture we got accolades all
around and I think more than just the
accolade itself it was actually just a
validation that that crazy idea that as
a black person in Africa I can be
present visually is actually not such a
crazy idea so with that then in mind we
had this wonderful content we had this
great feedback from from from different
from different people and so it was
really wonderful were on to a good thing
okay but it&#39;s no good having these books
just sitting in the warehouse right so
enter distribution distribution
separates the girls from the women
that&#39;s where it gets real I&#39;m telling
you content is ego distribution is
reality okay so how do we go about the
distribution then so first of all we
went to retail because again remember
that was where it was you know the idea
was born then why can&#39;t we get into
retail we got into quite a big retail
chain wonderful excitement
and grades they&#39;re gonna bring in orders
this is it&#39;s gonna retire rich young
okay reality is that they take up to 45
to 50 percent of your retail price so
cash flow is just non-existent so your
margins are just killed from the get-go
so that&#39;s the reality of retail and
that&#39;s we at that they are actually
dominant in the space and as a small
player as a start-up there isn&#39;t really
much that you can do about that but
that&#39;s fine as an entrepreneur you keep
the hustle going right so besides the
retailers then we also then looked at
direct and direct was always so it&#39;s
either pop-up stores either book fairs
with the boot of my car my hand
I was that woman who had about a book in
her bag and would come upon unsuspecting
people in the mall if I saw you with the
time I&#39;m like oh I&#39;ve got the perfect
thing here you go you know and our books
are bilingual so it&#39;ll be English with
soso - English with so it&#39;s like no no
actually we speak so it&#39;s fine I Papa
Zulu it&#39;s fine whatever you need you
know so the hospital is just there to
get that cash flow going and then
besides besides besides the the direct
we also did some international book
fairs which was which was great we had
an online store at some point as well
and I&#39;ll never forget when we got our
first on international order I was so
excited I ran up to my husband I&#39;m like
we caught an international order and
he&#39;s like where no one we know
and I&#39;m like no one we know a complete
stranger I don&#39;t know this person
and that was again just validating the
story and the notion and just the fact
that a child can be on the cover of a
book and the fact that we&#39;ve got so many
stories that action needs to be told and
people are hungry to hear them it&#39;s
really just about how do you connect the
content with the market we did libraries
we did schools both public and private
it wasn&#39;t until we did rural schools
that the impact that we were the other
side of the impact that we were having
actually just hit home it turns out that
in South Africa only 7% of our schools
have functioning libraries so access to
books is a real problem and what we then
found was that through our books we were
actually killing two birds with one
stone we were getting access we were
getting them the books so from a
literacy perspective we were having an
impact but we were also then getting
books that would then fill them with
pride and with self-esteem and really
just connect them with the fact that I
can be on a cover of a book that my
story also matters and it&#39;s really that
that then really then drove a lot of the
the distribution actually but it just
drove that bigger purpose of what it is
that we&#39;re doing and why we&#39;re doing it
so we would do container libraries we
would take them to the rural areas I&#39;ve
traveled quite a lot in terms of some of
the places that we would go to and the
excitement when we arrived there and the
kids see these books was just amazing
and they would unpack them we&#39;d also
bring in their parents as well and the
teachers so that they have a sense of
ownership of the books and the library
that&#39;s going to be used and the
excitement as you&#39;re unpacking them to
hear the parents already and the
teachers already saying okay so we&#39;re
gonna extend this as part of that corner
library we had and we&#39;re gonna check in
on the kids are gonna and this is as
were unpacking them and that was really
just priceless in terms of that kind of
impact that you can have we also then
created a campaign called give books
change lives and this was an opportunity
for people to be able to buy the books
and then be able to to take them we just
distribute them to NGOs who were in the
literary space again just ensuring that
you would be able to have the impact of
the usage of of of the books and we know
as well that the impact of investing in
education especially at the foundation
fades just brings back returns more than
any other phase of education so if you
build that found
early through literacy but at the same
time building that sense of pride and
recognition then that is the that is
where the magic comes in in terms of
investing in our future
and through our children so with that in
mind then from a distribution
perspective I must say it takes a
village to distribute 15,000 books so
along this journey we had so much help
from people who really just bought into
what it is that we were doing so we had
you know from from art from our lawyer
from from legal advice to the financials
to marketing at some point one of one of
my friends was like Oh everyone&#39;s doing
something for poor like this is just
everyone is coming in and getting
involved in one way or the other I mean
any kind of input that you need from a
business perspective we had friends
coming along and just helping out in one
way or the other
and to me yes it was about you know
helping because this is the new startup
business and and the like but more than
that I think it spoke to the fact that
there is that bigger understanding and
support that people had in the mission
and Bend and the purpose that we were
trying to do in terms of getting our
local content out into the market so
with that in mind where are we now
so the picture has changed slightly
so that&#39;s 17 percent of African content
or languages is now sitting at about 20
percent I think in terms of children&#39;s
mark children&#39;s books
it is also starting
slightly change but actually if you
think about the fact that children from
nine years and younger in South Africa
we have about 10 million children in
that age group the 15,000 that we did is
a drop in the ocean and the fact that
when you walk through our public spaces
you also don&#39;t have that sense still
that we are making that dent and that we
are actually present so there is still a
lot more that needs to be done there&#39;s a
lot that needs to be done from a Content
perspective we&#39;ve got the stories we
need to get them out and we need to get
them out with urgency if we are going to
then build up our children to be able to
believe that they can change our economy
they can change our society they do have
a valuable contribution to make from
local solutions then we do need to get
more of those stories out and what&#39;s
really nice now is that self-publishing
is also taking on a more of a foothold
than it was 10 years ago when we started
out we need to then distribute them and
we need to distribute them in in more
spaces and not just rely on the
retailers but be more innovative in how
we distribute them but also for each one
of us are we asking the questions as we
go into our different spaces to put
those demands on the retailer&#39;s on the
schools on any space that you&#39;re in to
say we are living in Africa why am I not
seeing us represented and then lastly
for our children we then need to then
make sure that they have those books
directly they&#39;ve got the different
content directly so that when they&#39;re
reading that story whether it&#39;s a
folktale whether it&#39;s a fiction so I was
a folktale
it&#39;s about the great civilization
whatever that story is so they can then
locate themselves into that story and
translate that into their real lives and
believe and know that they can do
anything that they want to do just like
they read in a storybook
