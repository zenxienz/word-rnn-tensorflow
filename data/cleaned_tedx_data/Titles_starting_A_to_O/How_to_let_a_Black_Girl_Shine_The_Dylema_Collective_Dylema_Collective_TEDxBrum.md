that beauty is not a shade for our
mindset and the best indicator of it is
self-confidence as I talk some sense
insert here confidence
[Music]
what if a black girl knew what if a
black or no what if a black girl what if
a black girl knew what if a black don&#39;t
know what if a black girl what if a
black girl knew then her lips were plump
and beautiful but she does not need to
hold them in make them thin does not
need to rely on Kylie Jenner to make her
lips an attainable thing what if a black
girl knew that there is no such thing as
a perfect nose because the nose isn&#39;t
meant to be perfect it&#39;s meant to help
you breathe and if you can breathe black
girl you&#39;ve succeeded so what if a black
girl knew that to be Russian as a
culture defined by the black goddesses
whose we could be any color and whose
speech could be any kind of cross from
slam to misplace grammar such creativity
so what does it matter
Miley Cyrus does not need to twerk to
generate praise for our culture but what
if a black or knew not to be bitter that
her father like her sons were raised by
black hands and you see in your father
what you eventually see in your map for
the modem of your father came from
similar hands so if theta is the stock
tur then how sweet can be demand if
bitter is the black girl then how sweet
can be our plan what if a black or knew
that her roofies waited in the South
what if a black girl knew that higher
two was like finally refined would
another fiber of her hair was
opposite of cool but it reflects on the
inside the struggle on the outside where
natural meets the straightness that we
take to our hatred hatred for ourselves
that we project upon each other but what
if a blacker knew that history recorded
her as the most sought after that her
bosoms were like raindrops that would
have dry out though
then her body was a magnet to world wide
wonder and the jealousy was so great
that if we lose to the perception of a
girl until a thousand years later she
was in the back
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
and they wonder why we go
because therefore doc kills the
Lafitte&#39;s a yo
what you think events opportunities are
what you take from it and there will be
no presents if no black girl wants to be
victim because to spring from our floors
I said no longer take me abusive

in your mind with walls decorated in
memories painted into vivid motions of
childhood lust and in town good
curiosity I see Mantle&#39;s of your first
love and the way her words left murals
on your tabletop I&#39;m a witness to the
pain you&#39;ve held on to for all these
years
in a mist I sit with your deepest
darkest fears but I stay I&#39;m still
standing in this room unafraid
everything is exactly as it was all
that&#39;s missing is the bed my bed my
limbs slowly becoming furniture this
room are too familiar fixated I know
exactly where I should be situated
