so did you hear that fisher-price has
come out with a bar set for toddlers
complete with beer bottles bar stools
neon sign the works yeah except it&#39;s not
true it&#39;s fake news and I was so angry
when I saw it because I had been
researching this concept for months so
let&#39;s face it it&#39;s easy to be duped by
fake and misleading news but I&#39;m
guessing that most of us don&#39;t want to
be duped or mislead so today I&#39;d like to
talk to you certainly about the rise of
fake news but much more importantly how
we can and should evolve in the use of
our critical thinking skills especially
when it comes to social media now
interestingly the term fake news has
been around since 1890 but as we all
know it&#39;s recently become more pervasive
and politicized now I&#39;m certainly going
to talk about politics so I think that
it&#39;s only fair that I tell you that I am
politically speaking a moderate yeah I
think that&#39;s actually illegal in the
United States these days but I&#39;ve
actually been a registered Republican a
registered Democrat I have voted in
every election since I turned 18 but I
have never paid attention to partisan
politics until the election of 2016 and
then when I began to pay attention to
the whole concept of fake and misleading
news the scope of the problem astounded
me politics and beyond so the first
question I had to ask myself was where
does the news in our social media feed
come from and the simple answer is that
it comes from legitimate sources not
legitimate fake news and a whole lot of
gray so the next question then became
how the heck did we go from having
Walter Cronkite as the most trusted man
in America to getting our news through
memes like the most interesting man in
the world well I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any
secret that news organ is
nations have needed to become more
focused on entertainment but that&#39;s
because we demand it and some would say
that that&#39;s because of our decreased
attention spans that&#39;s due to our
increasingly digitalized lifestyles but
news organizations have also started to
pay attention to make to the bottom line
ever since 60 Minutes appeared in 1968
news organizations have realized that
they can make money then let&#39;s throw in
cable news where everything is breaking
news on a 24/7 basis they need to fill
their time with shows that are
personality based that rely more on
content and ratings than news and hard
facts let&#39;s talk about newspapers for a
minute pure research says that in 2017
news well we know that newspapers have
also needed to move online in order to
maintain their profitability in 2017 Pew
Research said that now 29 percent of
newspaper revenue comes from on-line
sources like advertising and
subscriptions and that number is growing
even pen live our local based news
organization reports that 50% of their
revenue comes from online sources
because they made the decision a few
years ago to move more onto a social
media platform now let&#39;s also talk about
the online impact a little bit more and
hopefully you&#39;ll see why I chose to
focus on social media pure research also
says that in the last year 90% of
Americans say that they have accessed
news via a digital device forty to forty
five percent of Americans say they often
use a mobile device like a tablet or a
phone to get their news and that number
is growing even among adults over
sixty now Cathy O&#39;Neil author of weapons
of mass destruction says the problem
with getting our news this way is that
we begin to lose the contextualization
of information so something from a
legitimate news site like the New York
Times place in our brain the same way as
something from the onion a parody site
or something from a truly fake news site
furthermore O&#39;Neal goes on to say
Facebook does not optimize for truth or
for content it optimizes for likes and
shares and those that optimization comes
to us courtesy of algorithms now I don&#39;t
have a lot of time to get into
algorithms but suffice it to say that
algorithms pretty much drive everything
we see on social media and the data
shows that we are really only shown
about 30 percent of what we could see
and that&#39;s generally based on our likes
our comments and our shares so while we
think that we&#39;re seeing everything that
our neighbor posted the reality is that
we&#39;re seeing targeting courtesy of
algorithms targeting is also why if you
just did a search for sneakers what are
you gonna see online more sneaker ads
absolutely
now PC world did a study during the 2016
election and they wanted to test out how
algorithms made things different people
see different things and they created
two users who had the same demographics
except political affiliation and what
they found amazed them with almost
totally different news feeds with highly
partisan information going to each user
now let&#39;s also talk about those
seemingly innocuous Facebook quizzes
they promised to tell us what color our
personality truly is
the reality of those is that they are
often sponsored by companies who use
them to gain information about us that
they then sell to other companies who
use it to target back to us so yes we
all want to know what character and
harrypotter best represents us but it&#39;s
probably not in our best idea
all right much of what we see on
Facebook and social media appeals to our
emotions rather than our intellect in
order to get us to click on it and that
has led to the 2016 word of the year
post truth which means that we allow our
emotions to guide us in making decisions
more so than facts and here is where we
begin to see gray because where we used
to have to go in search of the news now
the news finds us online and it&#39;s mostly
tailored to things that we already
believe in and that has led to the
concept of the echo chamber and the echo
chamber basically says that we&#39;re
primarily exposed to things that already
reinforce our existing biases
now let me clearly state bias is not a
dirty word we all have them and if
somebody creates something it is biased
but the problem becomes when we as media
consumers don&#39;t see how our bias affects
what we see and then what we believe now
I&#39;ve had people tell me that I am all
wrong about the echo chamber because all
they see is news that they disagree with
well it&#39;s possible that that person is
seeing things that his or her neighbor
posted but I&#39;m also betting that that&#39;s
a person who&#39;s heavy on the trigger
finger with the angry and the dislike
face or commenting negatively on posts
they disagree with because the
algorithms don&#39;t differentiate they just
think that user wants to see more of the
same now much of what we&#39;ve read about
her we&#39;ve heard about after the 2016
election was predated in a book written
in 2012 by Ryan holiday called trust me
I&#39;m lying confessions of a media
manipulator and he says it&#39;s not about
getting facts out
it&#39;s about getting information to spread
quickly and generally in small bites
he says it&#39;s also not about if something
says that it&#39;s leaked or breaking he
says it probably means it hasn&#39;t been
fact checked and he says if it says the
truth about it&#39;s probably pretty far
from the truth now people who create
fake news that which they know to be
false
do it for multiple reasons some do it
because they want to upset the system
others do it because as holiday and
others point out it&#39;s pretty lucrative
studies show that people who create fake
news that they know to be fake can earn
up to twenty thousand dollars per month
anybody want to change jobs now Facebook
and Google have come out and said that
they are tweaking their algorithms so
that we won&#39;t see fake news anymore or
will at least be alerted to it and
that&#39;s good but the problem is it&#39;s not
going to do anything about that big gray
area of bias furthermore I think we need
to acknowledge that everything old is
new again technology is credited with
helping Martin Luther distribute his 95
theses George Washington is said to have
lamented his press coverage news and
entertainment have sometimes collided as
in War of the Worlds journalists don&#39;t
always get it right and we are making
their job harder because we demand
instant in
Meishan and finally it&#39;s not just a
problem in the United States it&#39;s
actually a worldwide problem so I have a
friend who&#39;s highly educated very
well-read and she looked at me and said
Linda I have no idea where to go for
good news these days not good news but
good sources of news and I think that
many Americans fall into that same boat
and I&#39;m here to tell you today that it&#39;s
really not as hard as it sounds it
really comes down to a change of habits
and that would mean that you have to
check your bias and check your facts so
let&#39;s first of all talk about checking
your bias the very first thing that I do
when I look at something is to consider
the source first I want to know is it
legitimate but then is it an opinion
piece or a hard news piece and beyond
that most importantly I want to know who
published it because that&#39;s going to
tell me a lot about what&#39;s in there and
what&#39;s missing after I&#39;ve identified the
source the next question I ask myself is
does it make me feel strong emotions
because here&#39;s a hint if something makes
you feel like yeah absolutely
or it makes you feel very angry chances
are it&#39;s playing to your biases now I
never recommend if somebody relies on
bias sources to get their news I never
recommend that they look at the opposite
side because that will only make them
angrier I encourage people to look at
least biased sources and that&#39;s
something that&#39;s been missed in our
conversation today is there our least
bias sources that focus on facts and
give both sides of any kind of issue my
favorite go-to place for least bias
sources and to find the bias of any
publication is media bias fact check
calm you can also I realize it might
sound like a lot you can consider the
path of least resistance by doing a
short term experiment commit to doing
this for a few weeks or more importantly
go into your social
media feeds identify where it is that
the biased information that you&#39;re
getting and eliminate it it&#39;s not going
to totally trick your algorithm but over
time you&#39;ll begin to see more balanced
information now after you&#39;ve checked
your bias check your facts as daniel
patrick moynihan once said everyone is
entitled to their own opinion but not
their own facts so I certainly encourage
people to take a look at headlines
because face book there are studies that
show that Facebook users don&#39;t 80% of
Facebook users don&#39;t read beyond a
headline and truly how could we read
everything but recognize that many
headlines are created by content
creators who know that they need to get
you to click on it if they want to make
money so recognize the headline is not
always telling the whole story then also
use fact-checking sites like fact check
PolitiFact snopes.com
now i realized i&#39;ve heard well linda
they&#39;re all biased any of the research
that i&#39;ve done all of their methodology
is spot-on and places them strictly in
the least biased category but other news
organizations are coming up with
fact-checking as well so and it always
is good to check more than one source
anyway finally it&#39;s also important to
consider who you listen to as an expert
in this day and age where everything can
be packaged so convincingly it&#39;s really
easy for people to dupe and mislead
others into thinking that they know what
they&#39;re talking about so you really need
to choose your experts carefully now I
know you can choose to do this and you
can choose not to do this I am thankful
that my husband decided to humor me
during my time of research and he
realized that he was unknowingly relying
on highly biased sources to get his news
from he eliminated them and he was
extremely surprised at how much
misinformation
he had been getting and how much
information he was missing now he hasn&#39;t
changed his political views but he is a
lot more fun to have political
conversations with and that&#39;s really my
final message for you today
Reuters indicated that 12 to 15 percent
of Americans severed relationships
during and immediately after the 2016
election I firmly believe that if we do
the things that I&#39;ve talked about we can
decrease that number and we can increase
understanding among us I really
questioned why anybody would serve or it
would continue habits that only serve to
continue to divide us so please won&#39;t
you join me in evolving in the use of
your social media by checking your bias
and checking your facts because after
all wasn&#39;t it Abraham Lincoln who said
can&#39;t believe everything you read on the
Internet
