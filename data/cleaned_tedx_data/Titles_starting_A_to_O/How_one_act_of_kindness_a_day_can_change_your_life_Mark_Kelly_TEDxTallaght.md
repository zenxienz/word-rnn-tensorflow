hope you feel better your anxiety levels
are gonna drop your blood pressure

improving your vitality and ultimately
making you live longer imagine that
anybody interested show hands everyone
else is lying okay well let me tell you
how I came across this unexpectedly my
name is Mark Kelly I&#39;m married I&#39;ve got
two kids I run a business I&#39;ve got the
same concerns as everybody else here I&#39;d
love to be happier and healthier like
everybody else here I&#39;m sure on a cold
and wet January morning I was running to
work and I came across a homeless man
the same homeless man truth be told that
I walked by each time and I don&#39;t know
what it was for I said to him would you
want anything
he said yeah I do coffee a milk and two
sugars grant so went in they got it from
and I gave it to him and I said my name
is mark by the way Sedley thanks for the
coffee then I was it awful away running
back to work and laying around that
morning I was feeling really good now
I wasn&#39;t sure because feeling really
good because I gave somebody a coffee or
because he was homeless not quite sure
but let me give you a little bit of
background at me I&#39;m a guy who&#39;s always
chasing self-help book seminar yoga
class I&#39;m trying them all in and this
feeling made me feel better than any of
them so I started to Google I was like
how can I make a difference a small
difference to somebody that&#39;s homeless
so it turns out that money and
perishable goods they&#39;re actually not
the way to go but to paste to brush and
socks are so he said grant went with two
pennies in Blanche&#39;s town and I got a
Tanner&#39;s worked and I started to put
them in these little plastic packs
and I put them in my bag and I said if
and when I come across anyone that needs
them coming and going from work
I&#39;ll give them a pack so Monday evening
I&#39;m coming home I&#39;m cycling through the
liberties and I came across somebody
grab my bike went over handed the pack
he didn&#39;t look up didn&#39;t acknowledge us
as a bit disappointed if I&#39;m honest
so got back on the bike but hey you know
whatever got back on the bike and I&#39;m
cycling down by Houston station and I
came across a man just beside the bridge
there and he was wearing these socks but
they were tonus sucks the type of socks
that you would have if you just come out
of an operation so I got off my bike you
took out my pack and I handed this woman
he took out the black socks and he
fought them on he looked up at me now I
could see I made a difference so go back
on my bike I put the kids to bed and
made some dinner and I was just feeling
great I was like that small difference
it made to their friends and I was
feeling really good so for the next
couple of weeks I just started to do act
of kindness I&#39;d leave her door open just
long enough for someone else to walk by
buy somebody a coffee I be able with my
charlie from shopping instead of
bringing it back to the Charlie ranch I
actually bring it over to someone&#39;s car
give take it to your often they can take
the trolley and then I do my way one of
my colleagues John has said he caught me
act doing a nice deed and he said to me
that&#39;s really nice what you&#39;re doing I
said you know what I&#39;m not doing it for
them I&#39;m actually doing it for me
because actually most selfish thing you
can do and it made me feel really good
word spread in my office as far as
learning development and they said mark
I think we should share this tell more
people about us so we did so we did
random acts of kindness for a week he
was kind of like Chris Kindle but random
we had a jar we put everyone&#39;s name in
us and they took a name and they do an
act of kindness for somebody else in the
job so Connor at lunchtime got a
sandwich on his desk
Dave our sales manager who spent most of
his time our sales meetings drive around
Ireland two colleagues surprised
them and watched his car one of our
colleagues just started two days into
her new job and a bicycle stolen on
hardwood trees as an office we came
together and we donated four euro each
and the Friday we presented her with a
new bike she couldn&#39;t believe that we
would do this for her she burst into
tears crying she now had a bicycle to go
with that helmet that she&#39;d been looking
at all week we were on a high because we
just found out for Euro we could see the
difference it makes now at the start of
this talk I said to you I&#39;ll make you
look younger and make you look feel
better anyone interested still yeah well
it turns out when you do a nice deed the
hormone oxytocin is released that has a
knock-on impact that drops your blood
pressure reduces your anxiety gets the
blood circulating so much so it goes up
to cheeks so they go all rosy red so you
look about 10 years younger where to
improve your vitality because
statistically shows you&#39;re gonna live
longer now I came across this completely
unexpectedly I was thinking I can make a
difference here so what I&#39;m asking you
today is do one act of kindness a day
for you but you just might help society
around the world thank you
