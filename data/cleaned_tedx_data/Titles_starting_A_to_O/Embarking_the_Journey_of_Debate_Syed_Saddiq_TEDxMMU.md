assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi
wabarakatu and good evening everyone
it&#39;s a pleasure to be here it&#39;s also
good to know that this event is not
canceled more to myself I just want to
correct the organizer the beauty about
debating in Malaysia is that you don&#39;t
need one icon to succeed in Malaysia I&#39;m
not the only Aegis bass speaker we have
Mubarak Wasi we have mr. Mohammed we
have Amira Natasha more just Minho the
beauty about the debating community in
Malaysia is that it&#39;s like a family I
mean I was with the organizers in
Istanbul where they made it to the grand
final of an international debating
championship the very sons of MMU but by
the end of my presentation here today I
hope you&#39;ll get one thing which is
debating is not only about winning
trophies it&#39;s not only about restoring
pride to the beloved country which we
debate for it&#39;s not only about the cash
price and the socials in which we enjoy
by debating is a lifestyle debating is
the community debating is something
which we breathe in and breathe out as
each day passes by and I think that&#39;s
the journey which I undertook and I
believe that that&#39;s the journey which I
will continue to pursue even after my
competitive debating days if you had
asked me approximately 7 to 8 years ago
what was debating to me before I started
and I asked this question to myself
almost every day because I&#39;m lucky
because approximately 8 years ago when
someone asked me to join the baiting I
see a debater is arrogant ultra
competitive
and back then of course I was in a Royal
Military College there are some people
who join debating just because they
wanna exit like military school on
weekends to see women in debating
competitions I&#39;m not denying that that&#39;s
one of my motivations but not the
biggest one but to me at that point in
time debating is not a thing I remember
when I was in military school when I
when I even considered to join the
bathing people say hey the debate club
is only filled by my boy oh you know
boyo that&#39;s not on your military school
slang Jenny like people who are arrogant
but one of my seniors decided to pull me
in and the experimenting side of me
decided to accept it
before I joined debating I was a
completely different person I distinctly
remember that when I was cooling in
Johor ninja Hall you have to go to
school on gammon after you finish like
your Navy school I used to skip school
agama all the time and I&#39;m not gonna lie
that&#39;s not the best part of me by used
to skip my religious class in school
almost every day till at one point in
time my gustas uh-oh the teacher of mine
said that sadek I predict that in the
future you will be a drug addict so
Nobunaga Dada obviously there&#39;s not the
proudest moments of my life there was a
time in which I was ridiculously lazy I
was ignorant I didn&#39;t care about the
issues around me I spent nights in cyber
cafes playing games but not nice reading
researching and engaging in critical
discussions but that was as I would put
it the man jahiliya the dark days of my
of my life what brought me out was the
light through debating because when my
senior senior Michael army as for who
until today I still call Master Yoda
when he pulled me into debating at that
point in time no one else saw hope in me
I personally thought I was hopeless as
well my English was horrible
I I always say this i used to pronounce
recipe as a recipe and all the typical
it&#39;s known in english is like clear-cut
mispronunciation it was horrible
even though my mum was an English
teacher guru to Milan Mary but by the
Sun to not be good in English slightly
odd it&#39;s not my mom it&#39;s me my knowledge
was very thin I always say that I once
thought Africa was the country and Egypt
was the continent if you ask me about
who&#39;s the name of the Prime Minister
back then only no one I wouldn&#39;t mention
because I&#39;m scared people might feel
it&#39;s very political but I don&#39;t know
about the rest I don&#39;t know my country&#39;s
history that was again Samantha Helia
but then when I got into debating slowly
but surely I started to disengage myself
from the ignorant shell of mine because
at that point in time debating if you
ask me was not about winning trophies
because I never ever imagined I&#39;ll be
able to win trophies through debating
debating at that point in time was me
joining important discussions with my
senior was me having discussions about
the history of Malaysia and global
politics with my senior from 8 o&#39;clock

at 9:00 until 2 or 3 a.m. in the morning
and from there onward I slowly virtually
moved into the more critical discussions
from where I was before but from there
onward I noticed that in order for me to
pursue my passion which is debating and
as soon as I found that passion I wanted
to do a lot more
I not only one win trophies and cash
prizes as cool but not the best but I
wanted to prove a point that someone
from Malaysia can win international
championships then someone who who once
couldn&#39;t speak English or was very
ignorant
could compete with the best in the world
and in order for me to reach that end
game I had to sacrifice a lot and a lot
of my close friends will know this I
read like so many newspapers every day
and a highlight you know it&#39;s very nerdy
usually hide I just text books a
highlight newspapers in which I&#39;m
blowing my own horn people call me the
walking Wikipedia because like every
time I on my phone reading the new
articles I&#39;m it&#39;s not the best or
sources but back them and you did enough
much like just keep on reading it all
when I wake up I read the BBC al Jazeera
The Economist and then during lunch
I&#39;ll read local newspapers and at night
I&#39;ll do a nice one research topic on an
important issue but that daily shadow of
mine it&#39;s not something which I only did
drink my debate days I still do it today
whenever I wake up in the morning
besides checking what&#39;s left which
everyone does and obviously for Muslims
in this my young football
but I still do my daily shadow of
opening BBC al Jazeera and checking my
apps because that will always be my
source of knowledge but it was their
journey which I took and it took me at
least two or three years for me to
slowly accustom myself to competitive
debating and I started winning national
championships and from international
regional tournaments and from there
onward moving to the wall platform the
World Championship
it was never an easy journey because
throughout that process there was so
much resistance just imagine a person
who&#39;s like a company I couldn&#39;t speak
much English and slowly starting to
speak in English imagine what your car
when you losing your friends back then
you say like you are you kamusta da
cunha can&#39;t pass the pinata which is
like you using the the language of the
invaders in Malaya is a lot funnier that
was one of the reasons my interface and
again when I used to see you debates are
ignorant and now I&#39;m debating my friends
go where you bloody hypocrite I mean yes
I was stupid
then now I&#39;m J I&#39;ve changed but from day
I realized in just the same way how a
senior of mine who&#39;s not a world debater
but someone&#39;s very passionate can
liberate me from the prison of ignorance
I owe a duty to do the same to those
around me and that&#39;s why I disbelieve
the notion that an individual is unable
to bring change in your own respective
ways that one person is merely one
entity which cannot change your whole
structure or whole system because if
that one person and the senior of mine
can change me why can&#39;t I do the rest
I&#39;m here today because of what that
person did because obviously of my
parents and the passion which I took but
that one person&#39;s path that passion in
me and from there on what I realized
that I wanted to do a lot more in just
the same way how debating liberated me
from the prison of ignorance back then
if you had met me back then it&#39;s only
ignorance I was ridiculously lazy I was
a bigot when I say bigger in the worst
of ways I&#39;m sorry to the ladies but I
mean in order for me to correct my past
injustice I had I have to be honest
about it back then to my sister and my
car car I used to tell her that she must
be a lady who knows how to cook
everything she must be at home she
cannot be a female leader because women
can only and I&#39;m sorry and I say that
with a straight face I&#39;m sorry that was
me back then I also used to believe that
people who do not share the same race
and religion with me will go to hell for
sure there is no hope for them that they
are always subpar substandard and
suboptimal in comparison to someone who
share the same characteristics as me it
was a painful experience exiting that
that framework eventually I did it but
then I noticed that I can&#39;t be the only
one if I&#39;m privileged to exit that
circumstance I must be able to share it
with the rest
and from there onward I no longer treat
debating only as a competitive sport if
I treated it as a lifestyle I treated it
as the means to activate the activism
inside of me from there onward I travel
from one country to another and now I
think it&#39;s almost 30 countries where I
teach debating and public speaking and
youth activism and I always make it a
point to go to countries where debating
is not that prominent I still remember
my trip to Pakistan some time last year
and that was literally two weeks after
the Peshawar bombing and when that
happened obviously where my mom knew
that I was traveling to pack his time I
must like her arm you cannot go there if
you go there you are sacrificing your
life and me being the disobedient child
which I still have not grown out from I
only told my mum that I&#39;m going when I&#39;m
on the flight said I love you MA and I
said what&#39;s that
bye-bye and I think I know I&#39;m there but
I had to make sacrifices obviously
because a lot of people sacrificed to
get me to where I&#39;m at today and from
there onward taught debating and public
speaking and from there or what I was
hired as a lecturer also as a part-time
debate trainer in my university in
International Islamic University of
Malaysia and there&#39;s a very unique place
and I can tell you this now because due
to some hiccups along the way not
necessarily my fault and now I cannot
like change more in public universities
but throughout that process I learned a
lot of things for example I had to teach
those who had the same mindset as me
seven to eight years ago for example
when I trained a person from Saudi
Arabia that person will tell me studying
how can I defend a topic by allowing
women the same equal rights as men sorry
how can I defend a topic which I&#39;m not
ideologically comfortable with but my
answer is always the same I say that if
you can still hold firm to your
principles if it is right
even after critically assessing both
sides understanding it in a
comprehensive fashion and yet in the end
you still maintain that principle of
yours that means you&#39;re not following
something blindly but you&#39;re an informed
voter you an informed person and from
there on what you can move forward and
that&#39;s why I never ever force a person
to change his viewpoints I always try my
best to bring that person through the
journey of self-discovery because I had
to go to that journey if from this start
I label the person as a bigger the
racist of the sexist we don&#39;t attempting
to engage that person that means I will
feel from the start to liberate the
person or to at least bring that person
on that journey or self-discovery and
from there onward slowly hearts and
minds are changed and from there onward
I also realize that I cannot be the only
one or the only debater who wants to
treat the meeting as a platform for
activism I also want to ensure that
other debaters share the same spirit and
passion as well and that&#39;s why whenever
I give talks like this or whenever I
attend debate tournaments I always
emphasize on the point the s debaters we
all our moral duty and responsibility to
assist those who are not given the same
opportunities SS the debating is a lot
more than debating about critical
life-changing issues in the confines of
the bedroom but debating is the
lifestyle in which you carry out side of
the debate room is something which we&#39;re
with you every single day
even when you go to sleep I hope that&#39;s
not blasphemous to fear still religion
is important to the point that I was
well I have to be very cautious twice in
all this this is one of it but from
their own way I see this trend becoming
a reality and in Malaysia I see a lot
more people doing this and even I know
even before me people are doing this by
now I think alhamdulillah I give a
national limelight but whenever that&#39;s
national limelight siowiy
see I&#39;m not the only one that&#39;s why I
feel a lot of other people around there
I just like to share a few things
specifically about Malaysia so even
though there are those who say that
debating is not our culture the bad
become Buddha Akita
but Malaysia has done a lot we have want
world championships just recently the
World Championship which I was elected
as the chief adjudicator I didn&#39;t appear
or the chief adjudicator I&#39;m glad to
report that UiTM Shah aalam a university
which is continuously condemned I&#39;m not
saying that they don&#39;t have problems in
structural reasons not saying that but
in a way despite facing those
circumstances two of the debaters from
UiTM Shah aalam was ranked second in the
world and it&#39;s brilliant they took down
the best of debaters from Oxford from
Cambridge Yale Sydney mana and one of my
students Amira Natasha Moore was ranked
the best speaker in the world and it&#39;s
not just an isolated event there are so
many cases this last year alone we broke
the Asian record they broke my record as
well by winning the Australasian
championship they won the Cambridge the
fastest but I know that these people in
the end will not just stop when talking
about debates and debate issues in
debate rules but in the end I know that
they will be your own activist even if
you don&#39;t choose to join politics in the
end that discussion alone will reach out
in areas which wouldn&#39;t have reached out
before and that to me what debating is
really about it&#39;s not only about winning
trophies and the fun socials but abating
is you engaging the journey of
self-discovery you finding who you are
what your principles truly are it&#39;s also
a journey in which you empower those who
might not share the same privilege as
you and I envision a future in which
every single person is a debater and I
always say this that debating is not
only a and
Club in Malaysia I&#39;m very glad to say
there&#39;s not a Lee club you go to
countryside Philippines the vast
majority of debaters they are sons of
millionaires and billionaires of rich
lawyers etc but in Malaysia I think is
still very much accessible to all
classes of people but I hope that that
sport and that culture can be expended
today reach out to everyone because to
me everyone is born a debater you don&#39;t
need to attend a debate club you don&#39;t
need to attend a debate competition in
order for you to become a debater the
point in which you believe in critical
thinking you believe in the journey of
self-discovery you love not only seeking
you care about issues around you you
want to empower and assist those who are
under privileged to me that inherently
the characteristics of a debater I&#39;m
sure each and every one of us would have
had the difficult conversation of
convincing our parents to do something
me is convincing to my parents to allow
me to play games back then but I was
debating but obviously as I always like
to stress once you are equipped with
those skills the power of persuasion as
my senior army has for once taught me
never misuse it by joining the dark side
of the force I mean if a Star Wars fan I
am as well also like we like to use
these references that&#39;s why to me in the
end
if after going through that journey
being equipped with the right skills and
from there on what you misuse it for
personal interest by backstabbing the
very course in which you undertook at
the beginning by putting people who are
on the privilege in worst position by
increasing a privilege I think that&#39;s
where the trouble lies but I think
that&#39;s when our community will check on
one another to ensure that the very
things which we learn will not be abused
and that&#39;s why I truly truly believe
that no matter who we are where we are
from what race and religion we subscribe
to I mean what background we had to go
through as long as you have the passion
and the desire to achieve a goal which
is conscionable I believe that anyone
can succeed and anyone will be able to
go to the junior self-discovery no
matter how painful and tedious it is I
will always remember where I stood that
before what I did the wrongs which I
have committed I made I might not be
able to correct my past but what I can
do is to ensure that the present and the
future will be much better if every
single action which I come in and I
still say that today that I&#39;m still
imperfect no one else I still commit
mistakes but throughout that process it
is a conscious effort which I learned
through debating which I&#39;ll apply in my
daily activity and I hope and I wish for
those of you who hear me today you will
engage on that journey despite not
wanting to join the debate pile promote
the debate club MMU for a bit but at
least you start going to the edge in
yourself discovery you start reading up
on local and international issues you no
longer shut your eyes and ears to
concern some problems of bickerings of
those around you but in the end we all
go through the process of self-discovery
discovery to become a global citizen
because I personally and truly believe
that being a debater or debating or that
lifestyle which is debating is something
which everyone is born with it&#39;s only a
matter of time when you will discover it
and for me even though I&#39;ve exited the
competitive debate scene I&#39;ll continue
to teach I&#39;ll continue to write I&#39;ll
continue to pursue the passion to ensure
the privilege which I have now can be
shed the rest of the world and I will
always always remain a debater until I
draw my final breath thank you very much
[Applause]
