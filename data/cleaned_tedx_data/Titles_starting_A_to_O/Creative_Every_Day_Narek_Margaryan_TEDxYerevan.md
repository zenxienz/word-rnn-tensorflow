hi I&#39;m Nora Markarian and I write funny
things for the internet movies and a TV
show called arm comedy which may be best
described as two guys making fun of
politics and still getting away with
that so when I was preparing for this
talk today I analyzed how I got into
comedy a little bit and I went as far
back as 1997 when I was about 14 years
old I went to school in Moscow and I
stood out in that school because I was
the black kid that&#39;s what people mean
people in Moscow call you when you&#39;re
from Armenia but I had really good
friends here are my buddies so you can
see I&#39;m standing out just a little bit
I&#39;m not the tallest I&#39;m not the
strongest I&#39;m not the smartest so I had
to be the funniest right truth is I
wasn&#39;t all of these guys were super
funny and this group right here we had a
tradition every day after school we&#39;d go
and hang around in exactly the same spot
would make jokes would make pranks
practical jokes would make fun of
passers-by
and we&#39;d make fun of each other we
ruthlessly destroyed each other every
day and we left to tears and every day
we tried to be better
tried not to repeat ourselves try to top
each other so as I was deconstructing
this this was my first comedy exercise
and probably the first creativity
exercise other than drawing supermen and
then bringing it to this children&#39;s art
gallery and being rejected so the topic
I wanna tackle today is can you produce
outstanding creative content on a daily
basis the answer is no of course what
are you crazy
nobody has ever pulled that off not even
Leonardo or the Beatles or Hemingway not
even Armand chick so this was the
shortest talk for today goodbye but what
if you had to produce creative content
every day so through the years I&#39;ve
learned a few tricks to how to keep the
creative juices flowing and I want to
share them with
you first one is reasonable
perfectionism what does it mean can you
expect to be in your Beatles or your
Armand chick mode every day no the truth
is you won&#39;t but the once you make peace
with that once you take that pressure
off you&#39;ll get less nervous and you will
have more concentration and focus to
create your to create your work
that&#39;s this mean you have to settle for
average and forget about great no
because once you&#39;re relaxed once you
lose yourself in your work that&#39;s when
the true sparkles of awesomeness keep
emerging the other one of course Armand
she keeps popping up the other one I
wanted to talk about is maintaining a
routine I&#39;ve noticed that the more I
maintain a routine the easier it is to
write every day it would take a
psychologist or a neuroscientist to
explain the reason why all I can say is
if you feed the muse more frequently on
the same at the same time the more it
keeps coming back
much like your friends so at this summer
I ran across a book it&#39;s called daily
rituals by Mason Curry and the book
tells that every great man you can think
of had daily rituals like Mozart Darwin
I don&#39;t know
Hemingway Kafka all of them had very
specific rituals the book sadly omits
Armand Schick for some reason but it&#39;s
reasonable for factionism so there&#39;s
nothing you can do about it
so this book told us that Beethoven for
example counted exactly 50 beans for
every cup of coffee he had in the
morning or Schiller kept rotting apples
in his drawer so that the decaying
smells somehow stimulated his his brain
or Stravinsky used to stand on his head
but since we&#39;re nowhere near this guy&#39;s
is genius we can be more humble for
example what I do I run in the morning I
have a piece of dark chocolates I tidy
up my desk and then and then I sit down
to work or on the days when I&#39;m very
very lazy I don&#39;t run
have a lot more chocolate and I just
clean up my computer&#39;s desktop somehow
it has a similar effect a music exists
and writer&#39;s blocks don&#39;t exist first of
all let&#39;s talk about what is a muse muse
is a fancy word for inspiration right
and many have tried to decode its
mysterious way through the years but now
on it no one has truly done it what we
can say is that some patterns exist for
example a great idea tends to come out
at night when you&#39;re sleeping on before
you&#39;re just about to wake up and my
advice is keep a notepad or a smartphone
really nearby so you can write that idea
down because believe me the idea will
disappear as unexpectedly as it came to
you I&#39;ve tried other things I tried the
voice recorder on my iPhone it worked
tremendously the only problem was that
in the morning when I woke up my awesome
idea sounded like this so yes write your
ideas down the other place where great
ideas usually come of course is another
place where it&#39;s impossible to write
anything down it&#39;s the shower there&#39;s
something primal about you standing
there naked water flowing or over you
and then a good idea pops well do
something can be creative muse has been
so much popularized in literature in the
movies that eventually I think it led to
what we call a writer&#39;s block
what is writer&#39;s block it&#39;s an umbrella
term for the time when you do not have
any new ideas and it applies to everyone
in the creative field there is dancers
block composers block I don&#39;t know
designers block that thing here is the
more you acknowledge writer&#39;s block the
more you feed the monster and if you are
creative kind you tend to dramatize
things and now suddenly you&#39;re standing
on a cliff
lightning sparks up the night waves are
crashing into the rock and you&#39;re
pondering over your great creative
problem should I use scarlet for that
color of that logo or
crimson of course to me the non-designer
these are the same colors and they&#39;re
both called
red but not to the designer the designer
is preoccupied so the suggestion I want
to make here is just relax sit down and
start writing something start designing
something because once you do that your
creative muscle kicks in your routine we
talked about earlier kicks in and then
you start producing something that is
has a chance of being good
the real creativity killer is
distractions and if I go for eight hours
working on something with distractions
and maybe a couple of hours in complete
isolation
I&#39;ve been work productively in those
couple of hours but the future that we
live in the future that is yet to come
has made isolation a complete utopia
right you get a call on your phone your
SmartWatch is why vibrating then
suddenly your laptop tells you you have
an email and then you get a message on
your Facebook your Twitter your
Instagram your viber your what&#39;s up your
Zanghi your telegram on top of that your
home appliances they also have
notifications your playstation is
telling you your friend is online your
Apple TV wants an update your fridge is
telling you that you&#39;re running out of
milk what to do I turn off all
notifications on every app I ever
download would you like to receive a
push notification not in a million
goddamn years no I have an app that is
called self control what it does it
shuts down my entire social media for a
period of time you indicate and I click
on that icon I feel extremely humiliated
for a few seconds and then I can
actually work and I wouldn&#39;t know if you
liked my picture on Facebook I wouldn&#39;t
know if you commented on my status I
wouldn&#39;t know if you had it although it
would be nice although of course if
Armen cheek was ever to comment on my
status I&#39;d interrupt everything and rush
to read what he has to say
the other obvious one is repetition
you&#39;ve all probably heard about the
10,000 hour rule
if you do something for 10,000 hours you
get better at it but can this that&#39;s
mechanical right can this apply to
creativity well I tend to agree that a
little bit because once you are good at
something you start paying less
attention to the technical aspect of it
and concentrating on the creative side
when I was writing my first movie
screenplay I concentrated heavily on
formatting because formats and movies
are very tricky I concentrated heavily
on structure because structure is even
trickier and less focus was left for
story and for characters and these are
the most important things so about four
or five screenplays later are I barely
ever think about format and structure
and I can concentrate on what what what
matters does this mean that eventually
creativity becomes easier No
but the end result you get from spending
time gets better so my advice to you is
repeat what you do every day repeat it
even if it&#39;s not your best work
repeated if it if you&#39;ll never show it
to anyone again
repeat it even though you&#39;ll never ever
remember what it exactly was in 20 years
much like the jokes that I did with
these guys in Moscow thank you
[Applause]
