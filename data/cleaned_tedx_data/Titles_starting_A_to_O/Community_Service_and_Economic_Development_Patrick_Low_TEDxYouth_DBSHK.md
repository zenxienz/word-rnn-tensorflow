good evening everybody and thank you for
the invitation I imagine you&#39;re feeling
pretty fed up by now so I shall be brief
I used to work in a place where
government officials used to make
speeches and they always used to say I&#39;d
be brief and you knew when they said
I&#39;ll be brief it was going to be the
opposite but I promise you I&#39;ll try so
the theme for this these sessions was is
the word catalyst I don&#39;t know who chose
that word but it&#39;s it&#39;s a clever choice
it&#39;s a good choice and a catalyst can be
many things to many people a catalyst
can be unexpected might actually be
expected if you&#39;ve engineered some
change and and and and you you you you
want it to happen it can be good news it
can be bad news it can represent a
challenge it can represent an
opportunity all those things are
possible and I did notice by the way
that when Wesley was introducing Nicole
he talked about the past generations the
present generations the future
generations I guess I know which
generation he thinks I belong to but I
would also just like to say to Wesley
where ever he is that I&#39;m still alive
maybe maybe just about so one of the TED
organizers also TEDx organizers also
told me please don&#39;t go on like a
grandad you bore them so I&#39;ll make an
effort on that front as well try not to
sound like a granddad I was a little bit
hurt but it&#39;s okay you get used to these
things so talking about catalysts I
wanted to give you a couple of examples
of Catholic things that happened in my
life early on I was born in Kenya in
East Africa quite a few years ago the
first half of the 20th century as a
matter of fact and it was a colony I was
born into a very colonial situation the
situation of privilege and
discrimination and until I was 13 I
lived in race
segregated in the racially segregated
environment those are terrible things
from the past and the changes were
dramatic they happen very quickly
because Kenya suddenly became
independent and that was it
everything was suddenly integrated it
caused terrible shocks for a lot of
people but it was very interesting it&#39;s
very challenging and that you really had
to choose how you were going to take it
were you gonna take it there&#39;s something
threatening something challenging or
were you going to take it as an
opportunity I think that&#39;s a really good
example of the way you take it I was
very fortunate because my parents were
very enlightened and I had always been
allowed to mix racially on our farm
because my parents were farmers so I
found it less difficult than some of
some folk and some time never really got
over him they didn&#39;t know how to do it
in any case when I reached so I&#39;d stayed
in Africa and did all my schooling
enough until I was 19 and then I really
couldn&#39;t wait to leave frankly I felt it
was an oppressive environment it was a
small place and I needed to see the
world so I engineered with negotiating
with my father to to go to England and I
ended up doing accountancy but what I
remember most about that period which
sticks in my mind very vividly was a
deeply humiliating experience when I
arrived at Gatwick Airport in London
first of all I was shocked by the
weather I was surprised to see white
people doing manual work because that&#39;s
not how it used to be in Kenya and it
wasn&#39;t it was just as it&#39;s just a
different sight a different visual in
the drizzle in the rain people hanging
out there washing in the rain but the
worst part was that I was going through
customs I was held up by the customs
officer I don&#39;t know whether he didn&#39;t
like my face or he was suspicious but he
stopped me and searched my luggage by
the time I was he&#39;d let me go customer
saw was empty and I looked over to
the accent in those days you could see
it was at the moment there were perspex
doors and I could see my cousin who&#39;d
come earlier to Cana earlier to the UK
from Kenya waiting for me and then I
looked at this Bank of perspex and I
couldn&#39;t see any door handles
I thought these English people are
really strange why don&#39;t they have door
handles and so I walked and I was
accelerating because I know my cousin
had been waiting and I unless and I saw
a black strip I thought well that&#39;s
really strange these guys instead of
having doors you have to price them open
and so I leant forward to prise the door
open and of course you can imagine what
happened the doors were automatic I
never thought of an automatic no I&#39;d
never seen an automatic door I&#39;d never
seen stairs that moved it was a complete
culture shock but the fact was I had
lost my balance by the time I got there
door was open I was sprawled with my
luggage onto a carpet in front of the
door that was my entry into England at
the age of 19 it was a very was a little
shock I mean it really depressed me and
I really had to pull myself against a
wait a moment that was one incident
doesn&#39;t make you an idiot you can
survive so I got over it but there were
lots of things that I took it took a lot
of time to get over because it was so
different and I had was so unprepared
and technology was a big part of it now
you&#39;d think it was you think back I roll
in in the in the late 60s technology
what was that well there was a new
technology in the late 60s even then so
anyhow after that I went my father had
explained to me that because we were a
farming family and there were four of us
farmers tend to be resource rich and
cash poor they have liquidity challenges
so he said look if you want to go to the
UK I can&#39;t pay for your university you&#39;d
have to find something else to do so I
said okay I don&#39;t want to go to the US
he said if you go to the US we can we
can support you because you can actually
earn your way through school in the u.s.
in those days you could in the you
was very difficult so I went and I went
to study accountancy and I went to a
present an old-fashioned provincial firm
that was positively Dickensian in many
ways and what we did all day was add
cash books by hand weren&#39;t allowed to
use nodding machine and that&#39;s literally
what after about three weeks I said what
have I done
how am I gonna survive this you doing
apprenticeships in accountancy so I was
in this accountancy firm do my
apprenticeship doing my studying adding
up cash books in the day and studying
for my exams in the in the evening and I
thought I can&#39;t deal I can&#39;t deal with
this I really didn&#39;t know how I was
going to continue and then purely by
chance I discovered that in those days
British government had a policy which
what which said that if you have been on
the tax rolls if you&#39;ve been a taxpayer
I didn&#39;t actually pay the tax because I
didn&#39;t earn enough but I was I was
nominally a taxpayer if you&#39;ve been a
taxpayer for three years you will be
entitled to free tertiary education I
paid nothing for six years of university
education and I received a stipend to
live well those that&#39;s unheard of today
you&#39;re lucky you get a scholarship which
will pay for part of it and when I look
back I say what a privilege that was but
then I also remember how horrible it was
doing accountancy for three years and
hating every minute of it the only thing
that sustained me was the knowledge that
I would be getting to university after
I&#39;d done my three years and actually
ideally I nearly qualified as an
accountant because it carried on doing
the exams but my parents were horrified
when I said I&#39;m quitting they said
you&#39;re made you were gonna content
weekend paid for what anyway so um I
remember that as a real milestone for me
and I remember how bad I felt about
trying to sustain those three years at
the age of 21 and 22 when you want to do
a lot of other things you don&#39;t want to
be stuck in an office and hating ever
yet I had a reason to do it and the
catalyst for that was that Lange got my
education up to doctorate level which
opened all sorts of doors for me and
allowed me to have some very interesting
jobs around the world so I just remember
that as a mater I want congratulating
myself for sticking it out it was just
really hard to do but I just did not see
an alternative the other thing I just
wanted to mention which has been on my
mind a lot and I find actually quite
upsetting is is to do with American
politics is to do with the arrival of a
new American administration and Donald
Trump Donald Trump has done essentially
three things that as far as I can see he
has introduced a level of civility which
used to be considered unacceptable in
political debate and so one question for
the younger generation is or is this is
this something that&#39;s going to stand
it&#39;s going to become the new normal that
you can be as insulting as base as
aggressive as as he has shown himself to
be in political debates so that&#39;s that&#39;s
one thing another thing is handling
truth does it matter if you tell lies or
not we&#39;ve always given some leeway to
politicians to make promises which verge
on lies with the difference between that
and telling barefaced lies seems to me
to be pretty dramatic and it&#39;s not only
in the United States that is something
that some British politicians did in the
barracks it debate when on the eve of
the election they put around a rumor
that if Britain stayed in the European
Union they would have the hordes of
Turks coming in and taking up residence
in the UK and the only way to avoid this
was to vote against membership of the EU
and it was a that many people think that
that helped tilt the vote anyway what&#39;s
happened in the in America now is very
much to do with how you perceive
prove this there&#39;s a new expression in
the in the in the language called fake
news so I read the other day that um
Barack Obama was divorcing Michelle
because they really hated each other and
that he&#39;d gone on vacation by himself
well is that true or not no it&#39;s not but
how do we tell so I think one of the
biggest responsibilities that we now
face is how to use and understand social
media and newspapers in terms of the
degree to which they tell the truth or
do not tell the truth and I think it&#39;s a
terrible challenge I think it&#39;s a very
very serious situation because it leaves
us in a very bad place in terms of
understanding what is going on so I
think educators and those who are being
educated have a real responsibility to
try to understand and recognize and
realize that they&#39;re not always going to
read the truth and that the media can be
deeply unreliable I think Donald Trump
actually has done a lot of this because
he wants to undermine the Free Press I
think that&#39;s a part of what he wants to
do he&#39;s been very disruptive we don&#39;t
know the only good thing as far as I can
see that he&#39;s done was today when he had
a telephone conversation with the
Chinese President Xi Jinping and told
him that actually they were going to
recognize they&#39;re circling the one China
policy well all the other stuff has been
very disruptive and so we&#39;re talking
about catalysts so one of the catalysts
for its right to be nervous its right to
be worried it&#39;s not surprising but
somehow we&#39;ve got to find a way of
sifting all ition that&#39;s available and
making sure that we can make judge judge
well judge decisions and well judged
forum well judged views prejudice is at
a premium that it hasn&#39;t been in large
segments of society for a very long time
that is the third thing that I think
Donald Trump has done he has made it
more respectable to be mean and to have
nasty and unsavory prejudices so all of
these things are things we should fight
against the bottom line is what do you
make of the situations you face do you
feel defeated by them do you feel
wretched you feel depressed do you sink
to the same level or do you say I am
going to find a way of making the most
of this situation I&#39;m going to harvest
friendly catalysts and I&#39;m going to
learn how to deal in a positive way with
less friendly catalysts particularly the
ones over which I have absolutely no
control it&#39;s easy to say and very hard
to do but I really believe it&#39;s worth
the effort even at my old age
thank you
