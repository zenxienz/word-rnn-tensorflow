good morning Birmingham let me invite
you to really look at where you are
because this stuff matters the built
environment has consequences it impacts
us all at a human cellular level
everything in our lives is built
environment where we live where we work
where we shop where we spend our leisure
time like today and the way that we move
between those places and yet it&#39;s not
part of our conversation it&#39;s not
something that we normally feel we have
a voice to contribute to the built
environment speaks to us at a
subconscious level it tells us that this
is what we deserve not just in this
moment but in life without even
realizing it we are all barometers for
how the built environment feels it
speaks clearly of the attitudes and the
values that created it in the first
place and if we don&#39;t stand for
something as a city we&#39;ll be told who we
are what we stand for my work is with
built environment skills in schools I
spend my time encouraging young people
to come into careers in construction
this is an event we held at the NEC last
week this isn&#39;t because I have a
particular love of construction in fact
some days exactly the opposite but
because I care so passionately so
profoundly about the product about what
we build Birmingham is a young and
diverse city and our industrial heritage
and our rapid growth means that we&#39;re
segregated in terms of our communities
our functions and our priorities and
construction isn&#39;t a career of choice
for many young people and yet the
opportunity the responsibility we should
be part of something that impacts lives
so profoundly is something I really want
to encourage
you might have noticed that the city is
changing but society is changing
citizenship means that we expect to have
our voices heard we expect to be part of
the conversation about what is happening
for us and about us I don&#39;t know about
you Birmingham but I think we need to
build better stuff not just pretty shiny
things but the things that move us
forward individually and collectively as
Churchill once said we shape our
buildings thereafter they shape us my
work in behavioral environmental
psychology tells me that thoughts become
feelings and feelings become behaviors
by impacting our thoughts the built
environment indirectly affects our
behaviors our consequences the choices
and the decisions that we make in life
and that psychological and physiological
impact of the built environment moves us
forward it helps us to feel and
experience but it also tells us where
things are wrong those feelings are
profound and they&#39;re far-reaching we do
some things fantastically well in the
built environment you might have heard
of hospitals where the very fabric of
the design helps patients to recuperate
more quickly we as a city are starting
to move away from some of our more
bizarre decisions that led to weird
abandoned spaces that became unofficial
skateboard parks and we&#39;re looking at
more flexible spaces eye contact is a
significant part of social activity and
social integration where we choose to
assemble determines how we integrate
with others and these flexible spaces
mean that people can choose to integrate
to the level that they are comfortable
that creates life between buildings
which is such a phenomenally important
part of the built environment you&#39;ve
probably stepped over this in your walks
around the city this is known as
concrete corduroy and is part of built
environments efforts to become more
inclusive and more supportive of
everybody in society this is designed to
help
people with visual impairments to avoid
trip hazards and to identify street
furniture and as Glenn mentioned there
are some pushes towards public transport
to supporting cyclists we&#39;re not there
yet this is the bike racket a new Street
Station our biggest train station so we
have a way to go but it&#39;s something that
we&#39;re understanding and embracing the
built environment also does some really
lousy things its isolation its fuel
poverty and one of the biggest issues
facing the NHS at the moment is a
massive rise in mental health problems
construction in the built environment
contributes to that through acoustics if
you can hear your neighbor switching on
their kettle watching TV that&#39;s the
beginning of low-level mental health
problems that&#39;s the beginning of
neuroses our efforts at inclusion aren&#39;t
always what they should be either many
of the buildings in the city centre have
these kind of intercom systems on their
front entrance
but how would a deaf person know when to
push the door and a recent cycling event
said that 250,000 car journeys in the
city are made every year of a mile or
less what that means is that earlier
this year Birmingham breached its air
quality toxicity levels the air in the
city centre is toxic and we&#39;re all
breathing that there&#39;s also a historic
legacy to that that the city has been
built literally and metaphorically by
people who don&#39;t live here are captains
of industry drove into the city in their
polluting cars works their magic and
then left again to go to leafy suburbs
and clean air some of the impacts of the
built environment is actually subliminal
believe it or not there is thought
process towards optimal pavement width
about where we assemble where we
disperse and how quickly we move through
spaces it can impact us without us even
realizing that that&#39;s what&#39;s been given
to us and as a city we have some real
social problems a report earlier this
week said that the homeless population
in the city is the highest it&#39;s been for
20 years
but anyone who&#39;s walked around the city
recently didn&#39;t need a report to tell
them that is this who we are as a city
is this what we stand for whilst it&#39;s
not constructions job to single-handedly
solve that problem as something as
complex as homelessness homes and
homeless people do seem like part of the
same conversation so when you go from
here today I really urge you to look at
where you are is it as good as it could
be is it as good as it should be is it
how you would have designed it and is it
what you deserve
most of the regeneration the city is
taking place within a square mile of
where we sit today and that speaks very
clearly about who we prioritize and
where we segregate construction you may
know is a hugely male-dominated sector
and the product that the built
environment is naturally a reflection of
a world seen through that masculine lens
and outside the confines of our city
walls we have some real global problems
the UN global report said that by 2030
the world will need 50 percent more food
and 30 percent more water than it
currently produces in construction terms
2030 is a week on Tuesday if we&#39;re not
doing those things now there&#39;s no chance
that we will hit those targets with that
in mind should every public building
that we have here have green roofs or
green walls to grow more food given the
bits Britain and it rains 300 days a
year
should every building have rainwater
harvesting the good stuff is within our
grasp I think we&#39;ve got to measure by
what we embrace what we create who we
include and the local skills agenda
unfortunately Andy Street couldn&#39;t stay
for today but the local skills agenda is
such an important part of that by
empowering young people to create the
future that they want gives us the
opportunity to create a better city
obviously women are missing from that
conversation in a sector that&#39;s so
male-dominated but also diversity in all
its guises needs to be represented
whether that&#39;s diversity in values and
priorities or cultural and ethnic City
and digital digital changes everything
Dyl gives us the opportunity to work
through the problems to understand the
implications and the consequences before
a spade even goes in the ground through
virtual reality through gamification
through 3d modeling we don&#39;t need to
learn from our mistakes we can design
them out when we delegate our voice to
others we find we delegate our
personality and then we find we might be
missing from the conversation when you
look at these beautiful artist&#39;s
impressions of spaces look at what
they&#39;re not showing you who&#39;s in the
margins if you don&#39;t see yourself
reflected in those people that&#39;s not
about political correctness
that&#39;s about representation are you
prioritized it&#39;s tough to stand for what
we believe in but this won&#39;t happen by
accident
and it&#39;s too important to leave to
chance the decisions that we make now
will affect the next 20 30 50 years of
the city I invite you to come and be
part of that conversation add your voice
because success is a team sport and we
all have a part to play when you go from
here look at your built environment of
the consequences the ones that you would
choose help me to build the things that
build more things build literal things
buildings places and spaces that build
figurative things community inclusion
opportunity participation come and be
part of the next chapter of your city
thank you
