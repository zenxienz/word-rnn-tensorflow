my grandfather was one of those people
who really embodied the phrase to whom
much is given much is expected now he
had an amazing life and he took it upon
himself to give back to those who really
needed it
now Papa Jack taught me both through his
words and his actions that showing
others love gives them resiliency and it
was these ideals that he passed on to me
that inspired me to join a certain
organization my freshman year at MIT and
this organization was bursting with love
I wanted to share my own personal spice
with this magical place Camp Kesem
so as a bit of background first I am a
counselor I camp Kesem which is a summer
camp for children aged 6 to 18 whose
parents have been affected by cancer now
these kids have to grow up before normal
kids should whether it&#39;s driving your
dad to chemo or having to put every
single meal on the table for your
younger sister because your mom passed
away but this camp is is pretty similar
to any other summer camp you might be
able to imagine as a camper the second
you step off that bus you run in slow
motion through a tunnel of counselors
towards the sunlight ahead of you is all
of the regular camp things to look
forward to messy wars campfires swim
time but then come those special moments
a moment to yourself to think about
somebody who is no longer here
the chance to share your story with 150
other people
the touch of a new best friend who
changed your life in unspeakable ways in
just five days
it is climbing to the top of the rock
wall because by God you have been in
scarier places before here it is easy to
laugh when it&#39;s hard to smile now this
is the experience that changed my life
but it is just one of infinite settings
to give and receive love the stories of
the following three children and a final
story about myself may give you a
glimpse into what I&#39;m talking about love
gives resiliency my sophomore year I was
a development coordinator which means
that I was one of the people in charge
of raising over a hundred and forty
thousand dollars so that camp could be
completely free for our campers that
same year I was a counselor for the six
to eight year olds I was especially
close with one of my campers dodge ball
now as you might have guessed dodge ball
is a ball of energy known most notably
and somewhat regrettably for his pying
abilities but on one of the last days he
came up to me and he asked he asked me
how much his mom pays to send his
brothers and him to camp I responded
immediately by letting him know that
it&#39;s completely free well then how much
do you guys have to raise for all of us
I tried to brush the question aside by
saying oh it&#39;s a lot but absolutely
worth it and dodge ball with his bright
eyes and slightly misaligned teeth
looked up at me and said wow you guys
must love us a lot
this seven-year-old for whom a major
part of his life thus far had been his
mom&#39;s cancer knew what it meant to be
loved and he took this love and it gave
him strength to just be a kid again love
gives
see this past year I got to work a lot
where the camper named minty minty is a
twelve year old girl who can talk your
head off about anything under the Sun I
remember having a conversation with her
about jellyfish for 30 minutes I mean
there was no way that this girl could
have been shy or reserved outside of
camp in fact last year I went to one of
her choir performances and this girl was
belting it but then this past September
she handed me a note addressed to
several counselors and myself I just
wanted to personally say to each of you
thanks for making my first year at the
best year I got a lot more confident
because of you guys so thank all of you
so much I love you all and I am glad you
guys are a part of my CK family so maybe
she wasn&#39;t so confident before camp
maybe the only reason she was able to
get up there with her choir was because
of the time that she sang at the talent
show and what&#39;s more she thanked me when
the most I ever did for her was yell my
head off and cheer for her during that
talent show the love that others had
shown this girl gave her confidence and
finally when she gave me this personal
award I knew that this girl was my hero
too love gives resiliency orange bunny
orange bunny is a 19 year old Camp Kesem
graduate as of August and I could not be
more proud of her she is the mom of camp
always there to hold your hand to give
you words of loving affirmation but her
background is laden with hardships in
this past year she shared her powerful
story with all of us and I hope that
this following paraphrase does her
justice it begins in China where she was
left on the steps of an orphan
she had no words for the emotions that
she felt she just knew that they hurt
and when she was seven she was diagnosed
with learning disabilities the emotions
that she couldn&#39;t name grew even
stronger but then as she was being
adopted she had so much to look forward
to an American family where she would be
loved unconditionally invincible to all
the scary things nothing bad could ever
happen to her and then her dad passed
from cancer when she came to camp it
changed her it gave her hope and
resolution and passion so much so that
she spent the entire next year working
in a restaurant kitchen saving up money
and finally she was able to donate that
money back to an organization that had
given her so much she sent us a check
with the following note thanks for the
magic thanks for being so supportive
this year I worked part time and decided
to donate to CK at MIT so that you can
spread the magic of camp to other kids
like me orange bunny the world needs
more people like orange bunny people who
truly live for others you know it was
not enough for her that she alone had
changed for the better
she took the magic and the love that
others had given her and given it back
to those who needed it most this young
woman embodies empathy and selflessness
to the point where she goes out of her
way to make a meaningful difference in
other&#39;s lives love gives resiliency now
at this point I&#39;d like to mention that
all of you here have had a meaningful
experience possibly similar to these and
what&#39;s important is what we make of it
in the following is my experience both
my grandfather as well as my grandmother
passed away last fall within 24 hours of
each other the most selfless man in my
life and the most patient woman that I
know will never get to see me graduate
from MIT will never get to see the man
that I have become I remember leaving
right after my grandfather&#39;s funeral so
that I could come back to Boston in time
for a camp reunion a place where campers
and counselors came back together to
relive the laughs and I was at one of
the worst days of my life
drowned and in tears and throbbing
embraces I went to one of the best days
laughter with tiny arms around my legs
and smiles from below and the thing is I
was at an all-time low and it was these
kids that helped me that showed me love
that gave me strength and in this moment
I was reminded of a song that is so
important to me in times like these some
days wouldn&#39;t be special if it wasn&#39;t
for rain and joy I wouldn&#39;t feel so good
if it wasn&#39;t for pain love gives
resiliency now I have a mission for all
of you here take the compassion in your
hearts and engage in activities where
you can show other people love and in
return you will get theirs thank you
very much
[Applause]
