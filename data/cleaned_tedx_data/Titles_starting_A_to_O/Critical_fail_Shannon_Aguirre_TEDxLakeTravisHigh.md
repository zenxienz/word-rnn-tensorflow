I engineer failure for a living
yep that&#39;s me I&#39;m a failure engineer and
I love my job as a failure engineer it
bothers me when educators try to prepare
their students for the real world and
then tell their students that they are
failing at it I came here today to tell
you that students are living breathing
human beings and that their world is
extremely real it&#39;s school world the
world that we imposed upon them that&#39;s
artificial well game world is also
artificial and I think that it does a
better job of motivating learners so if
we&#39;re gonna stick our learners in an
artificial world maybe we can learn
something by looking at game world as an
educator who loves her job like a lot of
my colleagues I work all through the
weekend to get the job done which means
I&#39;m working now and that means that you
get to take a quiz so get ready here are
your instructions all right pac-man I
don&#39;t play this game but my niece and
nephew told me I should include it Angry
Birds Mario tried-and-true favorite
that&#39;s my favorite so yeah these are all
the sounds of gamers failing and we can
learn a lot by how the gamers respond to
the failure
I&#39;m very familiar with this screen it&#39;s
my favorite childhood video game I
played it an awful lot and I kind of
sucked at it but even though it&#39;s
telling me how I failed there&#39;s even
like sad music and animations that make
me feel a little guilty and motivate me
the choices that it&#39;s giving me or
pushing me forward they&#39;re telling me to
keep the faith and to fight the good
fight and to not give up this point of
failure has become an invitation I think
we all know that academic failure does
not feel like an invitation in game
world we have this thing called a
critical fail it&#39;s when you lose ground
sets you back in your progress you may
get frustrated you may even throw your
controller across the living room but
you want to try again an academic
failure feels like a crushing defeat in
game world you start with your score set
to zero and your points count up and you
keep playing until you finish the quest
along the way you win a little and you
lose a little if you&#39;re me you lose a
lot but you keep going because you&#39;re
the hero and the realm needs you but in
school world from the students
perspective the opposite experience is
true you start out with 100 unblemished
perfect precious points and you do
everything you can to protect them for
as long as possible your shields go up
every multiple-choice question that you
answer every blank you fill every
homework assignment that you might
forget every lab every quiz every
project you&#39;re gambling that you might
lose some of those precious points and
you probably will at semesters end your
failures are permanently embrace and in
the grade book
and you know exactly how far away from
perfect your semester was in game world
there is usually some sort of currency
that you have to run around and collect
and then you spend it to get stuff to
finish your quest now that&#39;s not what
you&#39;re thinking about you&#39;re thinking
you&#39;ve got to collect the magical
objects so that you can use them to
reunite the pieces of the broken relic
so that you can use the relic as the key
to unlock the dungeon so that you can go
in there and slay the dragon and rescue
the princess it&#39;s like you&#39;re using your
problem-solving skills and critical
thinking and a variety of information
and some objects and you&#39;re integrating
them into a cohesive solution to a
multi-layered puzzle those coins were
just a little part of the solution you
weren&#39;t playing the game to gather the
coins you were using the coins to play
the game and a lot of gamers actually
find it annoying to have to run around
and get these coins we call it grinding
in school world grades are kind of like
those coins correct answers are worth a
certain number of points right and wrong
answers aren&#39;t worth much if any at all
and somehow the quality of work
disappears after a deadline because
after a deadline your work isn&#39;t worth
anything and all of this makes a lot of
sense of course in the real world it&#39;s
stopped making sense now it makes
dollars instead my econ teacher friends
call that inflation but imagine what my
game over screen would have looked like
to me if game world had used grades
instead of other kinds of motivation to
tell me how I&#39;m doing
and imagine how ridiculous it would be
if I tried to measure the contents of
your brains by looking at the size of
your paychecks that&#39;s ridiculous right
and I don&#39;t hear too many of you
laughing I hope you find that funny
and if you&#39;ll laugh with me the louder
you laugh the more likely it is that
you&#39;re a teacher because we&#39;re underpaid
but teachers there&#39;s an irony in that
too
now maybe you&#39;re with me maybe you&#39;re
ready to revolutionize this process
maybe you are right there with me and
you want to make school world look a
little more like game world it&#39;ll be
awesome right and yeah it&#39;ll be awesome
but it&#39;s not all unicorns and rainbows
I&#39;ve been doing this a while I&#39;ve
observed hundreds of heroes on their
quests and I&#39;ve watched them all fail
they didn&#39;t fail because they were
supposed to have collected at least 70
coins and they only brought me 63 now
they failed because they couldn&#39;t decide
in committee they couldn&#39;t agree how to
reassemble the broken relic they failed
because they mistranslated ancient
scrolls of poetic wisdom that last ones
not a metaphor latin teacher and this
kind of failure it really really freaks
kids out it&#39;s authentic failure kids get
freaked out by it even if they know
they&#39;re allowed to try again
especially when they know they&#39;re
allowed to try again because if they&#39;re
allowed to try again
they&#39;re never off the hook and I&#39;m tough
I&#39;m not gonna let you phone it in for a
completion grade I&#39;m not gonna let you
bring me a dragon that&#39;s seven dead on a
scale of 0 to 10 because completion
grading that project is a really bad
idea
if you&#39;re used to getting your feedback
from numerical little grades that you
get along the way it can be very
disorienting to be asked to measure your
progress by looking at your own
experiences and testing your own
hypotheses I can ask you some fantastic
questions about how you think the quest
is going I can spontaneously pop out of
nowhere and offer some eerily perceptive
observations on your dragon-slaying
readiness but at the end of the day what
it comes down to is that dret is it that
the dragon is dead or not if the dragon
is not dead yep go try again now when we
ask the learner to go try again to go be
the hero
we&#39;re also saying that you have the
opportunity to I&#39;m sorry I got lost when
we give the hero the opportunity to try
again we have to understand that it
might take multiple tries that there&#39;s
definitely going to be some teamwork
involved that there&#39;s going to be hard
choices and sacrifices along the way and
that the opportunity to try again is
affirmation that you really are the hero
as soon as we tell you it&#39;s too late I&#39;m
sorry you have no more tries we&#39;re also
saying you&#39;re not the hero any longer so
if we&#39;re gonna try this method this this
model of running a classroom we might
have to re-examine all of the roles that
we play and we&#39;re clearly casting the
learners the hero right there in the
spotlight up front main character of the
story but teachers might feel a little
uncomfortable with this because we&#39;re
used to being at the front of the
classroom and the spotlight so let me
offer some observations on who we&#39;re not
and teachers I&#39;m not fussing at you I&#39;ve
made every single one of these mistakes
lots of times
are not standing guard at the gates of
knowledge deciding who gets to come in
and read the scrolls and whose game is
over it&#39;s not our job to do that they
don&#39;t need our permission because we
don&#39;t actually own the knowledge we&#39;re
there to facilitate we&#39;re not going to
sell them a magical fake miracle pill
that&#39;s made out of completion based
rubrics and glitter glue no matter how
does disillusioned and tired we get
because we know how that quest is going
to end it&#39;s either gonna be a 20-year
vengeance obsession or twill love that
fails that that fuels that epic win we
are not going to be the monster at the
center of the labyrinth that the hero
needs to defeat to get access to the
next level it&#39;s not our job to put the
fear of God into them they&#39;re already
scared enough of the things that they
have to do and we would look ridiculous
in that costume and as much as we are
really into the subjects that we teach
and as much as we enjoy the activities
we&#39;re building we have to resist the
temptation to be the hero of the story
we have to let the kids do that it&#39;s
about building a quest that is worthy of
a hero and then equipping the hero to be
able to complete it if we make the task
too simple to wrote it becomes
meaningless and boring and this is where
we get to be failure engineers because
the failures make the game it&#39;s when you
fail that the player that you as the
player have to think again and learn
from your mistakes it keeps you engaged
it keeps you coming back the critical
fail is the moment where you want to try
again
and we need to resist the temptation as
they are failing to swoop in and rescue
them
it&#39;s our instinct where rescuers as
teachers but if we do that we&#39;re all
stealing their learning away imagine
what would happen if an entire campus
adopted a philosophy like this it would
be like all of us were developing
content for a shared operating system
the operating system being our shared
philosophy and we could make a vast
library of phenomenal learning
experiences and openly share them with
all now I can&#39;t tell you who the bad
guys are in this metaphor because every
curriculum has its own dragons to slay
but if you&#39;ve stuck with me this far you
as the teacher or the student already
know who your big bad probably is now
that your next step is to figure out how
do you defeat it I&#39;ve been doing this a
while and I started out alone and in the
shadows and it&#39;s dangerous to be in that
spot so let me share some parting wisdom
from my own experience the number one
sin in my classroom is to give up but I
never consider that you gave up I always
think that you took temporary pause and
I just haven&#39;t convinced you to come
back yet I never use grades as currency
only as feedback if I let you do an
assignment again and other people think
it&#39;s unfair because I paid you twice for
the same activity well that unfairness
only exists if we monetize the feedback
stream in the first place this is what I
think about you having the correct
answer you know who else has the correct
answer Google this is gorgeous when I
see this I am one proud mama
you&#39;re failing you&#39;re falling down
you&#39;re working together your reasoning
it out and it&#39;s beautiful once you have
figured out how to slay the dragon and
you have come to tell me how you&#39;ve
accomplished it I&#39;m gonna pause and I&#39;m
gonna express how awesome you are and
we&#39;re gonna high-five for just a minute
but then if you want the angels to sing
if you want me to give you a 100 in the
gray
book for the semester I&#39;m gonna get out
of your way and ask you to look over all
of your failure moments and you are
going to design the next game for the
next player you want evidence of mastery
I&#39;ve got your evidence of mastery right
there
if we want students to learn if we want
them to keep coming back for more
failure is an essential part of the
process and we&#39;ve got to stop
pathologizing it and sugarcoating it and
acting like it&#39;s something to avoid when
we do that we steal their learning from
them it&#39;s not that critical fails don&#39;t
hurt they hurt but they&#39;re an essential
part of the process when you&#39;re trying
to learn a critical fail is literally
critical thank you
