we all try to live moral lives I say try
because we don&#39;t always succeed one of
the ways we try and do this is what we
teach our kids kids ask a lot of
questions if your kid comes to you and
says can I hit this baseball with this
bat dad you say sure you encourage it
your kid comes to you and says can I hit
grandma you say no don&#39;t do that
that would hurt grandma that would be
wrong okay so far so good but of course
there&#39;s more in the universe than just
baseballs and grandmas what happens when
your kid asks you about this entity yeah
I&#39;m talking about Big Bird is Big Bird
more like Grandma or more like the
baseball dad would it be wrong to hit
Big Bird to kill Big Bird to eat Big
Bird well you might say ok actually Big
Bird is a fictional character lives on
Sesame Street fine but there are a bunch
of other entities out there in the world
that are equally perplexing what do you
tell your child if they ask about
destroying an embryo or a fetus that&#39;s a
pretty precocious child ask that
question what do you say if your child
asks about Coco the gorilla who can
understand more than 2000 words of
American English can sign in gorilla
sign language and even adopted a kitten
at one point she treated like a child
well what about entities that are made
of wires and gears rather than flesh and
blood mr. data from Star Trek or the
Cylons from Battlestar Galactica
well what about artificial intelligences
AIS who may not have a body or may have
many bodies think about a really
intelligent version of Siri on your
iPhone or Alexa from Amazon would it be
wrong to erase one of them you might
think there&#39;s a very simple answer to
these very complex questions and that&#39;s
just look at science science will give
us all the answers
we need in particular biology we&#39;re
human they&#39;re not focus on appearance
focus on morphology and that&#39;s the
answer to your question but I want to
caution you against that answer because
that answer is responsible for some of
the worst atrocities humans have
perpetrated in the last 400 years
whether it&#39;s American slavery or the
Rwandan genocide that is the answer that
causes that kind of thinking and for me
this part of the story is very personal
when I was 22 years old I spent a summer
working for the judges of the
International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda who were hearing genocide
prosecutions when I first arrived I
really had a hard time wrapping my head
around the idea that 1/2 of a population
could kill another half based on what
seemed to me to be small maybe even
imperceptible biological differences
ethnic differences but the more time I
spent doing that work the more I
understood that this was the end result
of a process of depersonalization to
take the other and treat the other as
less than a person
and indeed in Kenya Rwanda word that was
used for the Tutsis was in yinz which
means cockroach the idea being that
killing one of them was no worse than
stepping on a cockroach we want to avoid
the same mistakes of our ancestors three
hundred years from now we don&#39;t want our
descendants to be judging us with horror
and disgust and to do that we have to
stop making a simple but fundamental
error that error is in some ways a
linguistic error it&#39;s the way we use the
words human and person in ordinary
language we use these two terms pretty
interchangeably but I want to suggest to
you they&#39;re radically different
categories human that&#39;s a biological
category means a member of the species
Homo sapiens sapiens or at least the
genus homo count the chromosomes Big
Bird out grand Mayan
by contrast although we use the word
person pretty loosely to mean the same
thing in ordinary English in law and and
ethics we mean something more specific
we mean an entity that has certain
rights or certain duties the most
important right being the right not to
be
armed or killed without a very good
reason now once we understand this
distinction between human and person we
can see that we&#39;re making a mistake by
saying human equals person human does
not equal person in particular there can
be non human persons and what do I mean
by this
I want you to indulge me in a little
thought experiment imagine you&#39;re on an
airplane it&#39;s early morning you&#39;re tired
so you get one of those eye shades
trying to get some Z&#39;s and someone sits
next to you and they&#39;re kind of annoying
they&#39;re chattering quite a bit unless
you chatter turns out it&#39;s big bird now
don&#39;t ask too many questions about why
and my thought experiment big bird is
flying commercial just go with me on
that right so big bird is next year
wouldn&#39;t he seem to you with your eye
shade on just like every sweet friendly
silly sometimes annoyingly hyperactive
child you&#39;d ever met someone tried to
come over and bully big bird would you
not want to stop them would you don&#39;t
want to give big bird shelter someone
tried to come over and try to eat big
bird so maybe like really big chicken
McNuggets would you not react with
horror and disgust would you not want to
intervene why does it matter when you
take off your eye mask and see the big
bird has feathers a tender than skin why
should that make a difference in terms
of big birds moral standing it should
not now I know what you might be
thinking by this point you might be
thinking is this a talk aimed at making
me think that all animals and all
artificial intelligences have all the
rights of humans no rights are
complicated to think for every right we
can talk about we&#39;d have to think what
are the morally relevant characteristic
of an entity that affords it that right
but not another just because you
recognize one right a right not to be
harmed or killed without a very good
reason does not mean you&#39;re obligated to
give an entity every right nobody for
example suggesting that goldfish should
have the right to vote as inside there&#39;s
nothing about our being human that makes
us the sole decider on these questions
if we had animals or AIS that could
communicate that could reason they could
be purchased
these discussions they would have a seat
at the table not merely be the subjects
of discussions what&#39;s important though
is understanding why it&#39;s necessary to
take a person centric not a species
centric conception of who gets
protection if I would ask you why you
but not another entity deserves
protection and you answered it&#39;s because
I&#39;m human that&#39;s no better an answer
then because I&#39;m white was in apartheid
South Africa as Peter Singer recognized
long ago just as racists do wrong by
favoring their race over all others just
on the basis of racial differences so
species ist&#39;s do wrong by favoring their
species over all others just on the
basis of species difference now at this
point of the talk you may have a very
pressing concern you a little shy to
express it so let me express it for you
go something like this I really like
bacon some bacon fans in the audience
does this mean I have to give it up
Cohen what are you telling me well the
answer is maybe maybe not just because
you believe that there can be non-human
persons that some nonhumans are persons
doesn&#39;t mean that every animal in every
AI is a person instead what we need is a
set of criteria for personhood that is
species neutral it doesn&#39;t depend just
on species and depending on how you
define those criteria the community of
persons could be wider or narrower so
let me tell you about a few big
definitions of personhood and bioethics
one set of definitions sometimes called
capacity X views capacity X on these
theories you ask does an entity have a
particular capacity and we fill in the
blank with the X if the theory you have
is the capacity to engage in complex
reasoning towards future oriented events
then very few animals will qualify but
some like Coco might by contrast if your
definition of capacity X is the ability
to feel pleasure or pain then many
animals will qualify and you&#39;re gonna
have to think about changing your diet
to be completely Frank
there are also more complicated theories
you could say it could be one among a
list of capacities or jointly requiring
two or more capacities but on just about
every capacity X view an entity like Big
Bird will qualify as a person there&#39;s a
second set of views I want to Express
and these are particularly relevant to
debates about abortion and stem-cell
derivation
they&#39;re called potentiality views on
this view it&#39;s not whether an entity
actually has a capacity it&#39;s whether
they have the potential for that
capacity we ask in the ordinary course
of things is this the kind of entity
that would have this capacity so babies
for example are not born with the
ability to engage in complex reasoning
but we know that they will develop into
children into adolescents into adults
who will and we say because of their
potential we ought to treat them like
persons now a lot of work is going to be
done by that concept of the ordinary
course of things is that a concept of
development or a concept of
transformation is our sperm the kind of
thing than the ordinary course of things
becomes an adult what about a fetus what
about an embryo some very hard line
drawing problems we find this complex if
at this point your head is hurting a
little bit
believe it or not that&#39;s a good thing
why it means you&#39;re opening up your eyes
to the complexity of the moral world
around you and while it may be a little
bit frightening to consider these
questions to face them head-on
I want to urge you not to retreat into
the comfort of human equals person when
we know that gets the moral world wrong
so what I&#39;ve tried to tell you is when
you think about persons realize that
many of them won&#39;t look anything like us
they could have feathers they could have
gears maybe they don&#39;t even have bodies
when you encounter an entity and want to
know how to treat it
don&#39;t ask is it human that&#39;s the wrong
question
instead what you should ask is what are
the capacities needed for personhood and
does this entity have it or not now if
you paid close attention to the title of
my talk you remember there were two
questions one question whether there are
non-human purr
I tried to argue their candy but the
second question is are there non person
tunes are there non person humans and
this is a much more disturbing and
frightening set of questions you might
be tempted to say let&#39;s just expand the
community beyond humans but of course
every human being is a person indeed we
talk about human rights right the rights
you have just by virtue of being a human
being
why not give all humans an automatic
pass and say we&#39;re all persons well when
it comes to big bird or alexa or other
AIS we said that you need to look to
their capacities rather than merely
judging them on the basis of their
species or their category if that&#39;s
right as to Big Bird why not apply the
same theory to our own species isn&#39;t it
a little species is to say we&#39;re special
in this regard now if your theory of
personhood is something like the ability
to feel pleasure and pain then almost
all humans will qualify and it&#39;ll be
easy but then again so will almost all
animals on the other hand if your theory
of personhood is more demanding the
ability to engage in complex reasoning
to plan for the future if that&#39;s your
theory then through the unfortunate
existence of severe developmental
disabilities there are some human beings
who may not qualify on that theory are
we really prepared to say that they&#39;re
not persons are we really prepared to
say they ought not to get the protection
from harm we give other human beings I&#39;m
gonna try to give you a way out of this
problem but I&#39;m not going to vouch for
the fact but it&#39;ll satisfy you or not
but here goes even if and I&#39;m very
explicitly gonna leave it as an F even
if we think there are some humans that
do not meet the capacities or the
potentiality for capacities of persons
we might nonetheless have good reasons
to extend to them the protection from
harm or being killed why well maybe it&#39;s
because they&#39;ve got parents and siblings
who love them and those entities are
persons and for those persons interests
we extend the protection or maybe it&#39;s
because we think human beings are very
bad
decision-makers we get things wrong a
lot we want to err on the side of
caution be over inclusive or maybe it&#39;s
because we&#39;re worried about the dulling
of sensitivities this completely
resolved the question no I&#39;m not trying
to convince you that it does instead my
goal here today is to make you realize
it&#39;s something you might have taken for
granted something you may not even have
thought about before you entered this
room that human equals person is
probably wrong but the right way to
approach these problems is through a
person centric not a species centric
conception of who deserves protection
that to favor your species just on the
basis of species membership is a moral
wrong no better than racism and finally
while when we look at these difficult
questions these complex questions these
frightening questions about personhood
we may be tempted to retreat to
comfortable ground but if we want to
live that moral life we want to teach
our children right from wrong we have to
face them head-on thank you very much
