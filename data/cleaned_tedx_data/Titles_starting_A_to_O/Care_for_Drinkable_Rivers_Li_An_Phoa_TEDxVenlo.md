this river became my teacher usually I
walk in the open air where my thoughts
can may under and my words can branch
out so let me imagine let us imagine to
be on this walk today and in our walk I
will start sharing about my source where
I come from what teachings I got from
this river and how I see how drinkable
rivers could be indicators for healthy
ways of living my birthplace is seven
meters below sea level in the lowest
point in the Netherlands next to otter
DOM and next to the river River mass I
am a confluence of a Dutch mother and a
Chinese father and in this stretch of
cultures around the big globe I have
lived 10 years without a house as a
nomad and as a university teacher for
instance Erasmus University I&#39;ve been
taking students out next to the river
mass bicycling and we led the river and
the salmon fish inform us about polluted
rivers that at some point the salmon
river was abundant and at another point
they were totally gone and that when
policy changed having the salmon river
as a return as an indicator that after a
few years it returns and in my work
projects I combine walking and I go into
the wild and I survived big bonus when I
was 24 I had my first deep wilderness
experience here in this
River far in a subarctic north of Canada
in Quebec where the Korean the Inuits
still live for a month I pedaled source
to see the Rupert River with a group we
protested the Deming the potential
damming and diversion of this river at
the end of my walk no canoe trip this
was a canoe trip at the end when I
reached washc a Ganesh the little town
that is next to the inner sea of the
James Bay I could conclude that this
entire River was drinkable and that it
was not only drinkable it was vital my
hair got thicker my eyes got better
for days I didn t need to use my glasses
anymore or my contact lenses and I what
I learned from this river is that when
all the relationships are healthy the
bedding of the river the bank the entire
watershed then qualities like
drinkability and vitality emerge and I
also learned that like the river the
land flows an either side land or river
everything matters and that this flow
can not be broken three years later
though only three years later I returned
to this river the rock bedding where I
had been picnicking three years before
had been exploded by dynamite the
preparations for the damming of the
river had started fish got poisoned
mercury was found in water the local
people who have been for thousands of
years been eating this fish got ill
eating the fish and drinking the water
how is it possible
that these decisions are being made that
a once millions of years of drinkable
river and a living landscape of healthy
relationship of an entire food chain
that is coherent that it gets lost how
can we make these decisions so our
societal norms one of which is now
private property that there&#39;s no such
thing almost anymore as the comments
that we take care of together is lost
and another is that these indicators of
our economic thinking are dominated by
the amount of euros or dollars put into
a project and are generated from a
project the amount of jobs created the
GDP the gross domestic product the
amount of goods and services going
around in the system nationally all
these indicators go up but locally a
whole life line of healthy relationships
of a living landscape gets broken at
lost and not only here locally this is
locally worldwide so what we see what
the symptoms are of this behavior is
that 2/3 of our fish are now gone both
in rivers and in oceans we have
destroyed the habitats and we&#39;ve been
overfishing and we don&#39;t it is not only
with the fish this is with the reptiles
the amphibians the birds the butterflies
our minerals in the soil so also our
food 2/3 less and even more over flying
insect which recently learned
three-quarters over flying insects are
gone gone and not only biodiversity 80%
of the worldwide human population is
faced with a threat to see
purity of water issues either too much
too little or too polluted one example
was a place where there was a lack of
water the poor desperate it was earlier
this year in Kenya people were killing
animals each other because since June
the year before so almost a year
there was no water there no drop of
water had fallen and this as a result
pest realism that is disgracing with all
the goats and sheep they didn&#39;t have any
any more vegetation but still they
continued theirs their masses of them
and being desperate no water
they&#39;ve been plundering farms nature
reserves it was a shock to see that
people and farms were destroyed right
where I was in this desperate element of
water and on top of this we spent now
they have estimated that the past ten
years and coming 15 years overs a time
of 25 years that we spend 20 trillion
that&#39;s 12 zeros of creating this
infrastructure of repairing and
maintaining and of purifying water so
it&#39;s a whole industry there&#39;s a lot of
stakes and it this 23 and yeah what what
does that mean that is like the total US
debt or 17 times the EU budget annually
this year so we have been treating a
rivers like a sewage system like a waste
dump
rather than acknowledging it&#39;s a
lifeline an artery pumping the heart of
our living systems so what can we do so
I think that if we change those
indicators that are navigating
Arsen right now in this direction of
these 2/3 of loss of life and sign of
unhealthy relationship if we change it
to simple and engaging indicators like
drinkable rivers drinkable rivers could
be this guide leading us to this healthy
relationship then we might get there and
this is simple any child could protest
are we on the track towards drinkable
water is it drinkable this is River mass
water or is it not yet drinkable or are
we even going polluting it more a child
can measure it and I&#39;ll engage children
in my walks to indicate it and it&#39;s
engaging because we are water seventy
percent of forty five kilos of
approximately of bottles of water
standing here as well
eighty percent is our head is water so
we are it so also the quality of what we
are drinking we become and we need it
every day one time I was walking from
Mexico to Canada and I went in Indians I
go Borrego forest for the desert for
about a month and I started very feeling
very rich with nine kilos of drinking
water with me but soon it goes down to
only one and a half or half even and
then you have to make a decision do I
use it to hydrate my dehydrated food and
you&#39;re very hungry when you walk like a
marathon a day and are you going to use
for water or for hygiene of course you
use it for water but to have that
feeling of the emotion of needing it you
understand then the desperation that I
saw in Kenya so these delicate
interdependencies of creatives taking
care of this lifeline on the one hand
and the vulnerability and the necessity
on the other hand
and the simplicity of checking it on a
daily basis I think drinkable rivers
could be this indicator for healthy ways
of living so how can we care well I will
start to walk source-to-sea rivers and
I&#39;ll start with the river mass that is
burning right here
remember our imaginary walk so we can
see to the side we can see the river
mass that&#39;s why this is simple and so
I&#39;ll start in France and finish it by
birthplace in the North Sea in Rotterdam
and I will engage any of you local
people and organisations for instance an
organization that I invited over that
we&#39;ve been walking with his being
treeless Bank and his bank saw the
opportunity that they have for adopting
this idea and is walking culminated in
that now there is a proposal sent to the
Dutch central bank with the title
drinkable rivers as indicator for
healthy economy
so it&#39;s very exciting so I&#39;m gonna soon
sit with more the indicator and metrics
geeks to see how can we make the
translation and it the walks with the
local people and with you will inform
how do we do that how do we translate
from drinkable rivers as a vision to
making it real and what can you do ask
yourself what do you deeply care about
what is who is your River next to you
and where is your drinking water come
from what makes your heart sing this is
a bundle of questions but it leads you
to the same kind of enthusiasm because
this was my teachings I got from the
river Thank You Rupert River and I now
invite you to visit your River close to
you and see and share what teachings you
got from that River because wouldn&#39;t it
be magical if we can all drink from
rivers anywhere in the world like this
knowing that this is a spin-off for
biodiversity soil build up climate
stabilization that rivers are happy that
you are healthy for now and for future
generations thank you
[Applause]
join the spot Thank You yen thank you so
much for that now you&#39;ve really
literally taken me by the shoulders and
you&#39;ve literally like a doctor almost
take me and shaken me and said your
arteries are clogged and not only are
there clogs they filled with poison if
you can summarize in one sentence that
urgent call what would you tell the
people in the audience today thank water
before you use it ladies and gentlemen
good
