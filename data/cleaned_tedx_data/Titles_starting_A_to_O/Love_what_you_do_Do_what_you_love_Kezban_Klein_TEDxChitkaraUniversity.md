ok bad good awesome um imagine I would
tell you you can create a life when you
don&#39;t need any kind of vacations from
how does it sound bad or good good
imagine imagine you could create your
own life Novick and you don&#39;t need any
kind of vacations
never that sounds great no no who said
no please get out of here alright so I
am my name is Cass Klein I&#39;m Turkish I
was born in Germany and I was raised up
watching Bollywood movies now and then
and Bollywood series like Amar Akbar
Anthony P and yeah I always wanted to
live in India so God made it happen
thank you and as I want to also thank
Samir valya - for inviting me here and
the universe Thank You universe so yeah
I was more or less raised up by my mom
my mom was had six siblings and she had
to take care of those siblings and my
grandfather was due back in the day at
the point opinion she doesn&#39;t need to
study woman doesn&#39;t need to stop take
care they have to take care of kids or
of siblings and so my mom didn&#39;t study
she got married later and she got us
kids and our financial situation was not
so good
so she had to work she started to work
and my mom was a person who was always
super positive and she could wake up in
the mornings and she went to bed to bed
very very late and she had always this
kind of energy which was like yeah it&#39;s
parrying or somehow like a fire in her
and when we had parenting days at school
where my school friends parents were
teachers doctors lawyers managers they
asked my mom Remy
her nickname Remy what are you doing I
mean how come that you are always so
positive what is it what keeps you so
positive and what&#39;s your job she said
I&#39;m a cleaner my mom used to clean in
schools to survive and she said I&#39;m
doing this for my kids
and she was happy about it later much
much later I understood what drove her I
started my career with 20 how old are
you guys by the way 19 20
okay so I started with 20 I did an
internship at a record label music label
which is like awesome to work for I was
ready to see all the rock stars and my
first four months of my time at this
record label I was doing the rock sing
archive work so I started in the
mornings at 10 o&#39;clock and I started to
do xeroxing every day and every evening
every day so it was like an ongoing
thing so I was not really motivated it
was a kind of a boring job to be honest
and I was like oh this is like the job I
did I will never work I would get
married have kids do nothing a rich man
so like after four months I was almost
giving up I met this guy and I was
handling this Xerox machine and I was
putting this this thing down like BAM
and this guy came to me he was at the
other machine and he said what did the
machine do to you I said yeah
what do you mean so he&#39;s like yeah why
are you so mad with it and I said I&#39;m
not mad with that so and then I just
started to talk and told him since four
months I&#39;m here I&#39;m doing nothing than
xeroxing I can&#39;t even breathe anymore
it&#39;s completely blue because of the
Xerox color and I just complain and
complain and complain and I felt good
and he was like okay and I was like all
right so one day later I come to work
the HR HR manager asked me to come to
his office and I was a little bit scared
why and he said to me there was a merge
of the company so he asked me if I can
translate some words during that time in
Germany we don&#39;t he didn&#39;t speak mocking
much English so they were a merge of a
German company with an English company
and there were 10 words like licensing
in this music industry and I had to
translate it for the entire team so I he
gave me 10 words and he said one week
deadline please go ahead and do this job
so translated and then I said ok I
looked at the word and I was like hey I
read this word in all this magazines
which I&#39;m xeroxing every day since four
months so I finished the work in one day
I went back one day later I said work is
done he said what one day later I said
yeah it was easy because I mean I was
reading the entire day these kind of
magazines and then he said ok so here&#39;s
a list of 30 people
please Dericks it 30 times 10 pages and
then distribute it so again Xerox ins so
I was distributing it and then I went to
the owners office so and then I had to
say to the secretary here this is for
the owner mister chillin and he she&#39;s
like yeah you can give it to him
directly and he turns to me and I&#39;m like
oh my god that&#39;s the guy I was
complaining to so I thought I screwed up
my job though we complain but we still
want to be there so he totally took that
Xerox he read it and one day later I got
promoted so I was a lucky mom I
I worked at the record label as a deejay
promoter later I was junior or senior in
our product manager I was blessed that
people supported me always I had my own
car I lived actually quite well and I
met even Britney Spears and so I had a
kind of a good time and the guy who that
time met me he supported me quite well
so I was blessed and then I started with
25 like 5 years later I thought I start
my own record label I&#39;m ready for it
so I started and three months later I
was bankrupt the internet started during
that time and everybody was downloading
the music black so like internet poetry
maybe heard about it so yeah I lost my
job very quick and I had to do something
so shit happens
it&#39;s how we deal with it I some friends
that cast there&#39;s an opening at a
fitness center and they are looking for
Sales Consultants whatever that means
during that time I had no idea so I went
there I went through the interview
process it went well
I got selected actually I think they
were in need of people otherwise they
wouldn&#39;t have select me so there was an
opening like fitness clubs have this day
of opening like where a lot of people
are coming in and then they make a lot
of memberships so they needed to make
money and I started that day of an
opening and they said there are a lot of
people case you just show them the price
the club the club was amazing it was
like one of the best luxury has clubs
you can find anywhere in the world and I
was convinced about it everybody would
pay a lot of money for this club so I I
started the first walk-ins came in and I
showed them the club I was presenting
and like in the museum here we have the
pool and this is the gym equipment it&#39;s
awesome
I had like for six hours almost
I met 50 people not even a single signup
happened I was like okay that&#39;s not
meant for me it&#39;s not my place so I
almost gave up
the first day of my job and a couple
came in and this couple wanted to have a
coffee so they were sitting down having
a cup of coffee and they started to ask
me a couple of questions it&#39;s my first
day at this job so I don&#39;t know anything
nobody give me an induction so I offered
them the cup of coffee they asked me a
question I ran in the office I came back
and answered they asked me another
question
I ran into the office I came back so
that&#39;s my fitness exercise to go back
and forth four four times after a while
they said we want to think about it and
they said here&#39;s the credit card please
start our memberships and I was like hey
I&#39;m touring like 50 people the entire
day like showing them the amazing Club
and this couple is like not even seeing
the club and checking up a membership
what is wrong with these people
okay so my career started there in the
fitness industry later on I got trained
into sales and I understood what is the
sense of sales it&#39;s building
relationships it&#39;s not selling a product
what we sell is ourselves
it&#39;s trust it&#39;s a kind of yeah a rapport
I got trained by amazing sales coaches I
started to train new team members as
well and try to make them successful
so God wanted me to be in India and V I
got a job offer or we got a job offer my
ex-husband and me in India to run a gym
as the club manager he was the CEO oh
that&#39;s my first job as the club manager
run running a gym in Bangalore so for
one and a half years we were running
this gym making one hundred forty four
percent profit or we increased or the
optimize the processes and made it
better how did we optimize the processes
we gave them skills the team we coached
them we showed them we didn&#39;t cut we
didn&#39;t cut like positions or we didn&#39;t
fire anyone we just looked at it as
consultants or as club managers what
they do and we saw where&#39;s the
I made the best out of it and he gave a
little bit training to the people they I
realized I don&#39;t want to just do it for
one club with 30 people I would like to
reach out to more people because seeing
that you can help with a little bit
skill to a person to be more confident
and go out and earn better money was a
kind of thing what where I was looking
for a sense of the life
during that time this was 2011 so I
needed one year to find what is it what
I want to do and somehow I approached us
from Germany they knew there&#39;s a couple
in India and we wanted to do something
in India so I was just hoping that
they&#39;d make me a director which happened
so my husband left the country I stayed
because I love the country I love what
I&#39;m I mean I love the country so they
said okay this is the Academy now yes
hi-fi&#39;s an academy an academy from
germany they are into education and we
wanted to do something with education so
it was funny that they approached us
what happened they said he is the
Academy do something with it so I know
how to run a gym I know how to manage
people I know now say it&#39;s processes as
well I learned also a little bit into
fitness and sports running an academy
education what does it mean so I started
in my first year and went out and talked
to club managers unfortunately most of
the club managers are here as well I was
also in Europe are men and former
bodybuilders so they were bodybuilders
or they were both lifters and they
decided oh I start at the gym so I&#39;m
approaching them and I&#39;m telling them
hey listen if you give your team a
little bit more Skills you will be more
successful you will make more money
the men are looking at me I mean like I
think I approached like 500 mm
in the first year realizing nobody&#39;s
interested in skills so okay but I want
to be successful I want to do something
with this company and I want to help
people and I know it if if people take
it they will be more successful
so you when you run a company you have
to find solutions so it can&#39;t be just
because you are into a skill development
trainer trainings you stuck there you
have to figure out okay where are your
strengths how can you bring it in so you
are a solution finder and it comes like
easily and when you have a team and you
have to pay your salaries and you have
to pay your taxes so you have to be
creative otherwise you give up or you
get bankrupt and I had it once so I was
ready with that during my time when I
worked at the label and even at the gym
I had working timings from ten to seven
o&#39;clock I had holidays paid holidays I
had weekends off it was amazing

the time today I&#39;m waking up at 5:30
I can&#39;t I&#39;m not a person who&#39;s looking
for Friday&#39;s that I can have an awesome
weekend I can&#39;t wait for the Monday to
come by that I can approach those people
who are coming back from their weekends
and talk to them about possibilities
about changing their businesses making
them more successful so today I have
definitely definitely more challenges
than I was having when I was doing
xeroxing every day so today life is
definitely harder my last holiday was
last year like a proper holiday where I
went to Turkey and visit my family
visited my family spent like a week
there a week and enjoyed the time was
last year after that I have hardly a
weekend off I didn&#39;t have any other
holidays
I&#39;m not looking for any kind of
vacations I feel I don&#39;t need it so I

can&#39;t wake up in the mornings at 5:30

and I go asleep at 11:30 12:00 1:00
because my days starting early you
become when you know you have to survive
you become very experimental I started
to coach as well I had to so I have a
lot of clients I&#39;m coaching them I&#39;m
helping them to achieve their targets
that starts early morning then I go to
my work I have a company to drive then I
have back-to-back meetings and I live in
a city which is Bangalore so I know I
don&#39;t know if you ever visited Bangalore
and the traffic but the traffic is
amazing like crazy amazing okay so when
you have five meetings you are happy if
you can survive foot with two three okay
so and it&#39;s all always at the other side
of the town so I try to fit in all those
meetings in my day and then in the
evening I have to work and send my
emails it&#39;s a red sweater
so life generally is harder right now
when I was working for the label I got
my salaries on the first when I was
working at the at the fitness studio
I had my paid leaves 30 paid leaves in a
year I had even sick leaves do you know
in Germany there are social rights when
you are sick you get like paid like
after six weeks so it&#39;s like it was an
amazing time today
life is a little bit tougher but is one
thing which drives me or my team I have
a team and working with three people and
sometimes I have to tell them I can&#39;t
pay you on the first I pay you on the
fifth and they are like yes that&#39;s fine
there&#39;s one thing what drives us what we
are doing right now we choose to do it
so we decided to do what we are doing
now nobody forced us to do that I wanted
it I wanted to live in India I wanted to
do something by myself and I wanted to
do something which gives sense
to my life my team which is with me has
more or less the same way of seeing the
lives and the funny thing is we have the
same values now we are doing all those
things because we love what we are doing
so if he wouldn&#39;t love what we are doing
we wouldn&#39;t wake up in the morning at

5:30 can&#39;t wait to wake up we wouldn&#39;t
have all these challenges I&#39;m I&#39;m
training trainers who mainly I mean not
just now it starts that there are a lot
of women coming into the fitness field
starting their careers become or a
former PR marketing girls and but mainly
it is man driven like most of the
trainers are men most of the company
owners are men so I have to convince
them that I know the recipe for their
success so out of maybe hundred
approaches maybe one or two signs up and
no doesn&#39;t mean it is against us
ourselves and no is the chance to go
further to us again if we don&#39;t ask we
are not even able to get a no so we keep
asking we call people if they are
interested in something we get a no we
take the phone call again and we call
again so when you laugh what you&#39;re
doing you don&#39;t accept you know when you
love what you&#39;re doing you realize you
find solutions and you make things
happen without knowing that you have the
strengths for it when you love what
you&#39;re doing and this is what I realized
my mom was loving what she was doing
cleaning but she was loving to work to
be independent as a woman without an
education taking care of her kids so she
was loving what she was doing we Cynthia
asked her and she said I&#39;m missing it
the time she&#39;s now retired if you love
what you&#39;re doing life becomes not
easier but it&#39;s easier to manage so you
guys are now 19 20 21 years old now
you&#39;re studying you have an awesome
possibility you have the chair
to find out what is it what you would
like to do if you love what you are
doing you are not looking for vacations
imagine you find out what you really
love to do whatever it is go for it
I needed 18 years of my ty of my life to
find out what it is and the 18 years
helped me the 18 years had been out to
stand here and to talk to you about it
because I mean it&#39;s not wasted because
otherwise I wouldn&#39;t know how to find
all those solutions which I have to find
to survive if you love what you do or if
you know what you love make a have a
dream make a plan otherwise your dream
is just the wish I knew I wanted to be
something I wanted to be an entrepreneur
one day I tried it once I fit today I&#39;m
not as successful as I wish but I know I
didn&#39;t fail yet the company is three
years old and we have 250 claps we are
working with all over India and six
cities right now in Hyderabad Ahmedabad
Indore Mumbai Pune and Bangalore and I&#39;m
hoping hopefully I started chanting as
soon as well so find out what you love
go for it try to convince your families
that they support you I&#39;m sure if your
family if you if you I mean here&#39;s the
thing I have a lot of people who are
coming to me and asking for advices they
are former managers PR people they want
to start their Korean fitness fitness is
a growing market in India and they asked
me what can I do how can I start my
career and then I guide them and then
there is one topic which comes always up
can you talk to my parents I do talk to
parents as well I tell them
kid can start here it can go further
here it&#39;s not expensive and later they
can even start their own businesses
opening clubs or helping other people in
being or having a healthy life so don&#39;t
underestimate Fitness in your lives
Fitness is a lifestyle otherwise I
wouldn&#39;t have met mr. Samir Mallya and
wouldn&#39;t have been here think about it
if you love what you do
you can create a life where you don&#39;t
need any care any kind of vaque inches
vacations from how does it sound
