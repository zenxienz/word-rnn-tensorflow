Travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and
narrow mindedness so wrote Mark Twain in
innocence board which he first published
in 1869 and it&#39;s a statement that I
wholeheartedly agree with it was true
then and it&#39;s true now I&#39;m lucky enough
to travel a lot it&#39;s not a privilege
that I take for granted with every new
country I visit I learned something new
with every new country I visit I meet
different peoples I become less ignorant
more curious or interested
I learned that underneath the cultural
differences of dress religion landscape
that we want to very similar things with
least ability education for our children
we like the same things or care for the
same people our friends and family and
we laugh about the same things I learned
that we&#39;re not so very different travel
gives us a different sense of
perspective we see lives and stories
through the eyes of others I remember
when I was traveling from Mari through
burkina faso to Benin
I was fascinated by my driver&#39;s reaction
when we arrived at the Atlantic Ocean
he was absolutely terrified he wouldn&#39;t
go near the sea he&#39;d never seen it
before he described it as the lap
fasciae the angry lake it is brilliant
tree part he asked me to go get a bottle
of this water his salty water so he
could take it home to his family and
friends in landlocked marnie travel
breaks down barriers the changes our
perception our prejudice take for
example this girl where do you think
that she might come from in the world
and he guesses
perhaps Eastern Europe
would it surprise you if I said that she
came to come from Pakistan that is a
clash Katherine the Northwest Frontier
Province in Pakistan hard to be miss one
of the most stunning places in the world
and so too with these girls you travel
to Iran and you realize that it&#39;s not
about white bearded mothers that are
about 60% of the University students are
female and many of the girls such as
these two here where their hijab their
hair covering as far back as decently
possible they smoke shisha and they
spend all the time on their mobile
phones not dissimilar to mine my
daughter&#39;s mobile phone in that is so
what I&#39;d like to do is I&#39;d like to take
you on a journey around the world to
different destinations and in so doing
try and show you that we live in a in a
wonderfully diverse world and that we
should embrace that diversity
according to statistics Nigeria is one
of the poorest countries in the world
and the press continued paint a very
little negative image of it yet
statistics don&#39;t account for the
friendliness of the people and in
particular that would our be one of the
last great nomadic tribes of Africa and
every year after the rains that would
all be gathered for a ceremonial
festival called the Guerra well it&#39;s a
celebration of male beauty and then they
they paint their Chiefs bread they
blacken their lips with coal and I so to
their eyes to emphasize the whiteness of
their teeth and their and their eyes
they look striking and then over a
series of days they click they hiss they
chant and they lose dancers it&#39;s very
frenetic very energetic and sometimes
he&#39;s even they go into a trance-like
state it was a privilege to be there but
for me was the highlight who&#39;s his old
woman coming and tugging at my over she
wanted me to take him take part she she
was sad that I was by myself she wanted
me to enjoy the happiness of the tribe
the kindness of strangers
friendliness is how I&#39;ll also remember
Papa New Guinea yet mentioned people ask
people to describe PNG and they come up
with sort of primitive uncontacted
tribes in traditional costumes such as
these stereotypes they&#39;re outmoded the
reality is far more prosaic and when I
was there I was met with handshakes
everywhere welcome and people asked me
to sort of come to their houses smiles
and laughter yes there&#39;s an under tent
of PNG but it doesn&#39;t deserve the
aggressive stereotypes that it has so -
with North Korea yes there are
depressing stereotypes there is no
choice there&#39;s no advertising there&#39;s no
shop signs the propaganda of these
posters is there equipment there&#39;s no
individuality uniform is de rigueur
whether it be school or you or military
whether be ancient costume or the
ubiquitous jumpsuit that they wear and
everywhere he was two statues at Kimmel
song his tweeted his band he died some
20 years ago these far straight statues
in his huge great squares bizarrely in
spite of its problems and in spite of
its lack of freedom laughter is how I
remember North Korea whether it be the
laughter of the official here at the DMZ
the Demilitarized Zone at the border
with South Korea or my guide miss own or
indeed the guards at the border as I was
on the train leaving from North Korea
into China these guards Lee they stop
they look at your cameras they want to
make sure that you haven&#39;t taken any
unflattering photographs of North Korea
that Reds in a bad light if I see them
they delete them and I suddenly
remembered I had a photograph of me
standing under a statue of Kimmel song
and sort of mimicking his pose and I was
worried that it might was offend and of
course to God he finds his photograph he
looks up with me and he burst out
laughing he thought it was hilarious
absolutely nervous and when showing it
to everybody else in the carriage will
the other North Koreans so yes North
Korea is a very repressive regime but
that doesn&#39;t mean that everybody in
North Korea necessarily agrees
the regime once when I was in Sudan I
was a accosted I was accused of
supporting the Iraq war but he says
British I had to explain that I didn&#39;t
vote for the dang government and I&#39;ve
actually marched against the wall I was
I didn&#39;t like being accused or
associated with something my government
believed in and so too many people
around the world they don&#39;t want to be
judged by their government they are
individuals travel gives us the sense of
perspective we see lives and scenarios
through the eyes of others travel it
challenges us to let go of what we&#39;re
certain our travel encourages us to
appreciate to understand diversity and
to embrace it
Mongolia is there is a country of about
1.6 million square kilometres so it&#39;s
about six times the size of the UK it&#39;s
got a population of 2.8 million of which
60% are in the capital with invitar and
thus this farce ways of nothingness over
the whole of Mongolia and I headed into
the far northwest of the country to a
very remote region where horses were
first domesticated and when falconry was
invented it&#39;s also went to this day the
Kazakh Eagle hunters still ride out
horses with their Eagles hunting foxes
rabbits and marmots I was dressed in my
cortex down brand names and there was
dark and the eagle hunter his face sort
of risen by the elements in his
resplendent in his fox fur jacket on his
arm is a is a second program bird of
prey and she it&#39;s always a she because
the Kazakhs hunt with with females
because they&#39;re they&#39;re much bigger than
the males
she is called Eagle number 7 now this
surprised me a little bit because that
was really very affectionate very fond
of his bird so much so that he sleeps
with it literally his wife one side of
the bed and the burn of the other
but he pulled an equal number seven
because like this the city before him he
will release it well release her say
when she is seven years old so we head
out into the wilderness into the
beckoning silence the snows squeaking on
the hoof and like a Sioux raiding party
we gaining height we gain advantage
until we&#39;re looking out it felt like us
on the edge of the world is Cruz Great
Plains in front of me and at that moment
I didn&#39;t want to be anywhere else in the
world
Eagle number seven she&#39;s sitting there
she&#39;s scary
she&#39;s scanning she&#39;s looking for the
slightest movement into the white of the
snow her eyesight is seven times greater
than ours
sunny she sees something a cry goes up
she&#39;s released she sweeps down very fast
a rabbit seen running this pretty she&#39;s
closing in closing in and then nothing
predators are not as successful as our
TV screens would have us believe
and indeed the success rate of an eagle
is about the same as as a liar about 25%
but the uncertainty of that strike rate
doesn&#39;t stop Callahan going out hunting
the uncertainty of the weather
successful hunting odd didn&#39;t stop me
from enjoying that experience from
savoring that moment from wanting to be
nowhere else in the panic we cannot hope
to succeed if we&#39;re afraid of the
outcome if we&#39;re afraid of failure we
have to embrace uncertainty and not
always play it safe if you ever go out
Safari
I would urge you to go walking you won&#39;t
see as much but you will learn so much
more if I wasn&#39;t a vehicle I wouldn&#39;t
see the ants let them know let alone
notice the difference between them I&#39;m
sure you&#39;ll notice the difference but
the ones on the Left they&#39;re there
dispirited dissolute wandering aimlessly
they&#39;ve had an unsuccessful hunt whereas
the ones of the right they&#39;ve had a
successful hunt they&#39;re their pincers
got termite body parts in them and you
can see it you actually
then they&#39;re pumped up they&#39;re engaged
they&#39;re working walking with pace on
foot
you won&#39;t see as much but if you do see
something it&#39;s a far more visceral
experience especially if it&#39;s a camp and
I was lucky enough to see literally bump
into a leopard and for about three four
five seconds
it was a face-off between us yeah
Christy was just it was magical the
uncertainty of that moment of his face
up with his leopard it was humbling and
nature is humbling and so to travel
especially someone like Kodiak Island
which is the Emerald Isle of Alaska and
it&#39;s the home would be the Kodiak bear
which the world&#39;s largest carnivore and
thus I was a little surprised but
excited with my guide Jen said right
let&#39;s go walking when were walking
around just clapping our hands the whole
time just going hey there hey bear she
didn&#39;t want to surprise or bump into a
bear but I said the the joy of going
something like that people in this area
you never know what&#39;s going to be around
the corner the uncertainty is the thrill
of the chase we saw evidence of bear
everywhere there&#39;s scattered different
size and consistency huge great bear paw
prints and salmon
the Bears Metheny on everywhere the
detritus of salmon and of course
eventually we did also see bears and
especially one sub on that male who kept
on coming closer and closer and closer
until he literally a matter of feet away
from us I was transfixed and all this
young bear in front of us the intensity
was it was tangible
I stood so very still Jen was remarkably
calm throughout she&#39;s using her voice
the turn of her voice to control the
movements of that bear and the bad
listener
the bear responded to her and reassure
them a bear moves on the intelligence of
the bear is somewhere between that over
a very smart dog
unlike humans the intelligence of a bear
varies from individual to individual and
also is based on their life experiences
in front of me was a very intelligent
very curious bear that defies its sort
of its aggressive stereotype I think we
should be like this bad we should be
curious which would be collectors of
experiences banal to the country that
I&#39;d like to take you to is Guatemala
it&#39;s a it&#39;s a Clyde escape of color
whether it be the dazzle of the
hummingbird to the traditional garb of
the Mayan women and there&#39;s coloring the
people but especially in the guides and
especially this man here Carlos let me
give you an insight into Carlos his
story he was born in 1976 and had a
carefree childhood growing up in the
jungles of Watertown that was until the
morning of Friday the 2nd of May 1984
when there was a knock on the door
Guatemala at that time was embroiled in
a brutal civil war and political
disappearances were corn corn place so
Carlos&#39;s father was taken away never to
return
Carlos says that the image of his father
standing there at the door looking back
at Carlos who made serious memory he
will never forget it but you also say
that his father was saying something
silently to him his father was saying
Carlos I&#39;m going away for a short time
but I will be back in the meantime you
are now the master of the household
Carlos an 8 year old boy made a solemn
promise to his father to do just that so
Carlos Quentin the days turn into weeks
but still his father didn&#39;t return
eventually chorus resolved to leave the
village and walk through the jungle took
place with tikal it took about a week
tell you about 25 kilometers but he
wasn&#39;t 8 year old boy
surviving on his slingshot what he could
kill he arrives in tikal wanders around
a road to San Benito and a different
life Carlos had never seen a car before
did that Faison was the uncertain of
what to do what to do next
no he hitched a little san benito an
insane militaristic school he&#39;d never
seen a school before but again he was
unfazed by that he was unsure of what to
do next he approached the teacher
persuaded teacher to land to enroll in
the school and he went on to study and
over the years he passed his exams and
then self-funded his way through
University the next significant day in
college his life is the 30th of December
1996 and that&#39;s the day of the
Guatemalan Peace Accords were signed
there&#39;s a day if Connors realized his
father wasn&#39;t coming back
hope shattered his resolve as we doubled
to look after his family so he trained
to become a guide and he&#39;s gone on to be
in my opinion not only one of the best
guys in Guatemala but the whole of
Central America and in so doing he
supported his family and also the wider
community in Walker time so much so that
in the local language they put him
caliche
Kelly J means Shane I think the chorus
is more than lived up to that silent
promise that he made to his father
Travel is it&#39;s very humbling it shows us
that we don&#39;t always know the path ahead
of us but we shouldn&#39;t be afraid of it
the final destination that I&#39;d like to
feed to is Chad now Chad is a space in
the map in the middle Africa that is
little known and then sadly as a result
little understood and many people were
very uncertain a bit uncertain about
traveling there
I would urge you to think a little bit
differently and travel to the remarkable
region of an yeti in the north of the
car
which has got to be one of the most
scenic stunning desert regions anywhere
in the world or to Sakuma which is a
little name park in the southeast corner
of of Chad it&#39;s a park where the
accommodation is simple it has no walls
its floor which makes the other rule the
rule of the land will more visceral when
you hear it at night but you don&#39;t go to
screamer / the elephants you go for the
eddies is the post avoidance of human
now over the centuries they&#39;ve been
hunted hunted horseback of Spears and
the defense mechanism of these elephants
was quite unique but they used to gather
into this time football which helped
them against the the horses spearmen and
Spears but when it came to semiotic
automatic weapons in the 1960s this was
devastation to the elephants in the
early 1970s they were thought to be
about three hundred thousand elephants
in there in the greater region or around
here now there are just four hundred and
fifty elephants in Sakuma alone
thankfully that terminal decline in the
elephant populations has been stopped by
the wonderful works of a great
organization called African parks and
also by these guys the Rangers for Sally
let&#39;s come with a price in September
2012 for instance there were six Rangers
were at a prayer one morning they were
ambushed and they were all killed and
when I was there I met a Frenchman whose
special services who was working with
the Rangers both to mentally but also
sort of physically militarily how to get
out of this I said to him what do you
say to a group of men like this who who
only not very much in the middle of
nowhere and I had all their colleagues
killed in in various incidents he said
to me what I said between between me and
them will remain between us but what I
will say to you
we went into room together and we cried
and we cried and we cried
there are many remarkable men and women
around the world who have a far less
certain present and future than us doing
many remarkable things the final image
that I would like to leave you with is
one of interests interest is trained to
become a ranger his father was killed in
the line of duty
and I was worried that he was one to
become a ranger to have revenge
so I asked him why why he wouldn&#39;t
become a ranger and he said emphatically
quite simply because of the elephants
Travel is about people it&#39;s about people
like interests don&#39;t be driven by what
scares me be driven by what inspires you
be a collector of experiences thank you
very much
