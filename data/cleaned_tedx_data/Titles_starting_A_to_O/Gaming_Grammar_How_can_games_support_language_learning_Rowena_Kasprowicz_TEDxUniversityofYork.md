and so as Erina says I&#39;m going to talk
today about a project we&#39;re doing
looking at how we can use gamification
in order to support language learning in
primary schools so just to provide a bit
of the background and context to the
project in 2014 languages became a
compulsory subject in primary schools so
this means that from the age of seven or
children and our learning a language in
school now whilst this is a hugely
positive step towards expanding language
education within the UK it&#39;s also
brought with its own difficulties of
particularly for schools in figuring out
how they can go about implementing this
new curriculum now traditionally within
primary schools language teaching has
focused on teaching vocabulary so words
and chunks of language through songs and
poems and different classroom activities
in games however a key requirement
within the new curriculum is that
children are able to understand grammar
and they&#39;re able to understand basic
grammar relevant to whichever language
that they&#39;re learning now often when you
talk about grammar people often
associate it being a bit boring a bit
dull and often the more complex and
difficult aspects of learning a language
and so teachers and researchers such as
myself have been asking and thinking
about how can we be teaching grammar in
a way that&#39;s going to be engaging and
effective for these young learners now
as I said there&#39;s been a number of
issues that have come up with language
teaching in primary schools so first of
all there&#39;s a lack of resources so a
majority of the online and digital
resources that are available for
learning focus on teaching vocabulary
and for those that do exist there&#39;s not
always that much evidence about what
benefit these might actually bring the
second big issue that we have relates to
time in many schools I think in over 80%
of primary schools they allow between 30
and 60 minutes per week for the language
teaching and this is quite a short
amount of time in which to deliver the
full requirements of the National
Curriculum and the third issue that&#39;s
come up relates to teacher confidence
and expertise so in over 50% of primary
schools it&#39;s the class teacher who&#39;s
been asked to now teach the language in
whichever language the school has
decided that they&#39;re going to teach
and very often these teachers may have
little if any knowledge of the language
that they&#39;ve been asked to teach and so
teacher confidence is a real issue
particularly when it comes to teaching
what are perceived as the more complex
or difficult aspects of the language
such as grammar and so in response to
these issues we&#39;ve been looking at how
we can bring together language teaching
research and best practice from the
classroom and also gamification and game
design in order to develop a digital
game that can be used to support
language teaching and particularly
Grammer teaching within the classroom
now just to explain a little bit about
the teaching behind it we is based on
our teaching method called form meaning
mapping and the idea here is that you&#39;re
giving the reader children lots of
listening and reading practice whether
it&#39;s going to direct their attention to
those grammar features that normally
they might overlook or ignore when
they&#39;re reading or listening to a
foreign language so for example if you
think about the sentence yesterday I
walk to the shops we already know from
yesterday at the start that this thing
happened in the past and so what
learners tend to do then they&#39;ll ignore
the IDI that&#39;s on the end of the verb
because they already know we&#39;re talking
about the past and so therefore that
learning doesn&#39;t happen and so we&#39;ve
taken this research method and there&#39;s a
lot of research evidence to demonstrate
that this is effective with a range of
learners inability and ages and
languages and we situated it within a
game we&#39;ve built a game around it and
the idea within the game is that the
player is a spy and they&#39;re fighting to
take back the world from an enemy
organization and by learning the grammar
they&#39;re able to crack the code that this
organization used to communicate and
within the game the first thing that
they&#39;ll see is oh we&#39;ve progressed
further - okay okay so within the game
the first thing they&#39;ll see is the world
map and in each location they&#39;ll have a
mission or a minigame to complete and
each minigame focuses on teaching a
particular grammar feature so now I&#39;ll
hopefully it&#39;ll work I&#39;m going to show
you a short video clip
to give you a taste of what the game
itself is like okay there&#39;s no sound but
it is playing so this is all being read
out at this point we might have sound
greetings agent you are in an enemy base
you must pretend to be an enemy agent
be careful agent do not let the robots
discover you each time you must decide
whether to feed one robot or feed all of
the robots this robot wants to say
something click on him to hear what he
has to say Jim our victim at the verb
more ends in E the e ending is used with
sure which means I press the belt before
the time runs out new module shukriya
the verb more wrong ends in all the all
ending is used with new which means we
[Music]
okay so that just gives you a bit of a
taste of what the game is like hearing
what the children experience when
they&#39;re playing the game so as I said
we&#39;ve taken this teaching method and
we&#39;ve got research showing that this is
a good teaching method it works and that
the children learn so why put it in a
game what benefits is adding a game into
the mix and all that time and expense of
creating a game what benefits is that
going to bring well the first thing that
people often say when they&#39;re when we&#39;re
talking about games and the context of
education is that games are fun and they
can provide a more motivating and
engaging environment in which the
children can engage in
learning and we know that in learning
motor vision and motivation is driven by
sense of progression by the learner
feeling that they&#39;re making progress in
their learning something new and also by
a sense of enjoyment that they&#39;re
enjoying the activities and the lessons
that they&#39;re engaged in and when we
think about games by their very nature
their goal-oriented so the player is
what there is working towards a
particular goal or outcome and also they
have that invoke reward system so the
players constantly getting that feedback
on how they&#39;re progressing and the
performance that they&#39;re giving and so
these factors can help to foster that
sense of motivation and engagement and
this is actually what we found as well
in our recent work with local primary
schools so we took the game into some
schools to see how children respond and
on the screen there you can see some of
the comments that the children made and
I was particularly struck by my
interaction with one boy in the first
few game sessions he was really
struggling and he had a really difficult
time with the learning content and he
was struggling with the game he was
struggling to make any progress and he
often was failing levels and having to
replay and then in the very last lesson
his hands shut up and he said miss I got
two stars that&#39;s the best I&#39;ve ever done
and he really persisted all the way
through you could see at the end when he
won those stars the pride on his face he
was so pleased and right from that very
first session he kept trying he kept
playing learning from every attempt and
eventually he was successful and having
that motivation of wanting to complete
the game and win the stars that kept him
going and kept him playing and
eventually he was able to achieve that
goal now the game context also means
that we can then embed that learning
within a more communicative and
meaningful context in which the learners
using the knowledge that they&#39;re
building in order to achieve certain
goals or outcomes in the game itself so
you saw from the robot food game we star
in the clip the goal of that game is for
the player to feed the robots and to
keep them happy and they win the game
but they can only do that by paying
attention to what the robots saying and
paying attention to those particular
grammar features so paying attention to
the fact whether it says I or we at the
start and whether the verb is singular
or plural
and on the screen this is an example of
another game in which the goal is to log
mission reports and stamp mission files
either is accomplished or continuing but
the player can only do that by paying
attention to whether what the spy says
is in the present or the past tense
so by intertwining the learning and the
gameplay it creates the environment in
which the learner is able to more
greatly understand the importance and
the meaning of that feature within the
context of the game and it also creates
a scenario in which success in learning
is success in the game itself and vice
versa and that in itself can be more
motivating and engaging and
interestingly this is often the hardest
balance to strike when it comes to
developing educational games and and
software&#39;s getting that balance between
faithfully implementing the learning or
the teaching that you want to do whilst
also making a game that&#39;s fun to play
and getting that balance is important
because you want to make sure the game
teaches what it&#39;s supposed to teach but
also that the player is going to want to
come back and keep playing and using a
digital platform also means that we can
have a lot of other benefits for example
it allows us to more quickly and
efficiently track the progress of every
single players so this is useful for
teachers in monitoring the progress of
all of the pupils in their class at the
same time and also for us as researchers
it means we can gather more fine-grained
and nuanced information about the
language learning process so not only
can we see before and after the game
what they&#39;ve learnt but also we can see
all the way through playing that game
exactly how that knowledge was
developing and how that learning process
was happening and of course the players
themselves will receive that data back
in their own progress schools are seeing
how they&#39;re progressing within the game
now finally what I think is perhaps one
of the biggest potential impacts of
games within education is the potential
they offer for being able to personalize
the learning experience so as a teacher
I&#39;ve stood in front of classes of 25 or
30 pupils all of whom have very
different needs and ability
and backgrounds and experiences and I
always ask myself how can I make sure
that my teaching is going to have an
impact on and benefit every single
people within that room no matter what
stage of learning there are and so by
harnessing the data that&#39;s generated
through every interaction that the
player has in the game we can use that
in order to develop tools that can adapt
more intelligently and dynamically to
the needs and ability of every single
individual at any one point in the game
so for example giving more adapted
tutorials or more individualized
feedback or by allowing slowness to
progress on some more complex more
complex levels as soon as they&#39;re ready
or by allowing them a bit more practice
and reinforcement in earlier levels if
they&#39;re if it&#39;s needed and this can help
then make sure that every single
individual is able to make progress in
the game and ultimately then progress in
their learning and so we&#39;re hoping
through the gaming grammar project to
provide one demonstration of how games
can be used to have a positive impact in
providing a more motivating meaningful
and personalized learning experience for
every single learner
no matter the stage of learning their
apps thank you very much
