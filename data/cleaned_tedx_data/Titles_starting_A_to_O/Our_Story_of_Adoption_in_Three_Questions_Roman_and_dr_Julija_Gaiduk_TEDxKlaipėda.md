we have a riddle for you I have six
children from six different mothers and
I have six children from six different
fathers how many children do we have the
right answer is we have six children and
they all came to a family in their own
unique way if somebody had told us 20
years ago that we would be parents to
six children we would have laughed into
their faces with disbelief and yes we
did talk about our future family before
the wedding that one day it will be good
adopt someone for some reason we just
believed it&#39;s gonna be a good thing to
do and then two years into the marriage
after we had lost our first child
through miscarriage we thought that was
the one day we decided to not wait any
longer
and applied for adoption our first son
came home on Christmas Eve he was only
one month old and we never stopped ever
since several years after the appearance
of each child once things got settled
down we would decide there was still
space for one more not all of the
children came as babies and we had a
biological child somewhere in the middle
so right now we have two adult children
living independently ages 24 and 21 and
4 still living with us
ages 18 13 7 and almost 1 although we
get surprised looks when people here we
have 6 children our lives seems quite
ordinary to us know is non-stop if you
want to have your own quiet time
probably have to wake up the earliest
before anybody&#39;s up or you have to lock
yourself up in the bathroom although
that doesn&#39;t work most of the time
because somebody will definitely
knocking on the door large pots
oh yes large pots in fact we don&#39;t know
how to cook in small amounts anymore 8
litres of soup not 5 kilos of potatoes 2
kilos of meat every recipe would take we
just multiplied by 4 and
it&#39;s about the right amount now the good
side of it if you ever stop by to visit
us there is always something to eat in
the fridge we may not necessarily have
clean plates but there is food and piles
of laundry it seems like I can never get
to the bottom of the laundry basket no
matter how hard I try I never see the
bottom of it if I do by some miracle
it&#39;s only for a couple of moments until
somebody comes back from a walk every
time I go shopping I look like a mill
care in two to four bags full of
groceries then I call them my own my
boys to help me to bring them up to the
fourth floor the smaller ones unpack the
bags and put everything in its place
actually we make sure that everything
has its place because in an apartment of
the size we have if you don&#39;t put it
back into a place you&#39;re gonna live in a
mess very soon speaking of mess dirty
dishes is another challenge it only
takes one meal for our family and the
sink starts overflowing with stuff to
wash so we rely on our kids for help I
think the person who invented the
dishwasher deserves a Nobel Peace Prize
everybody in our family after the age of
7 gets their own dishwashing Duty day or
week depending on the age and so they do
the cleanup in the evening and our
kitchen looks marvelous at night very
clean so thanks to our kids we don&#39;t
have to do dishes our chore is to make
sure that they do and that&#39;s quite a
chore and bathroom is the hottest place
in our apartment at least three people
at the same moment want to get there and
there&#39;s always a queue so the moment you
get in and try to relax
somebody will definitely lock a knock on
the door with a plea could you please
let me in or national tragedy will
happen so you rush you do everything
fast you open the door just to find out
that the person who is so urgent changed
his mind and will come back later
so here we are now a family with six
kids the realities that we described a
normal everyday realities of many
families with several children they have
become ordinary to us in the same way
different ways of having children have
become ordinary to us adoption
biological foster care there are all
normal ways for us of forming a family
it&#39;s quite normal for our kids at a
certain age to ask other kids who gave
birth to you because you know your
parents adopted you who gave birth to
you or sometimes they would ask beyond
parents of infant&#39;s did you give birth
to him or did you take him or it&#39;s also
normal for us to celebrate not only
their birthdays but also the days when
they came into our family and we
understand on another hand that in our
context our family is somewhat unusual
even though it&#39;s quite ordinary to us
when all of us walked down the street we
get stares and sometimes we hear
discussions behind our backs things like
are they all theirs
no this one cannot be theirs too old or
too light here yes they&#39;re all ours they
just came into our family each one in
their own time and in their own unique
way we still have a long way to go only
half of our children are adults but even
to get where we are here where we are
now we had to deal with deep personal
fears that sometimes felt paralyzing
some of the fears were still struggling
with Roman what was your greatest fear
well as a man one of my greatest fears
was will I be able to love them will my
heart be big enough to embrace all of
them will there be enough room for all
of them so I just had to take a leap of
faith and hope that my heart would
follow and to my surprise my heart did
follow I fell in love with the youngest
children were adopted within month and
with our last baby who was 10 days old
I
fell in love with in basically hours or
days and today when they come back after
a hard day of work or a long trip I put
him on my lap I play with him and you
know looking at him gives me a fresh
perspective on what really matters in
life now with older kids it did take
longer we had to catch catch up on years
and years of Nomad mutual experience we
had to build trust then respect I had to
spend time getting to learn everything
about them and let them to learn
something about me but what I realized
but the more you put in the more you
have that love is the result of personal
intent and work and effort for some
reason I was never scared that I would
not be able to love children it&#39;s very
easy for me to attach for me a greater
fear was will it be a good mom feeling
that the kids are mine comes pretty
naturally to me but having that feeling
does not guarantee that I will raise
them well and the many mistakes that we
made where and are constantly feed in
that fear we have not always given them
the patience that they needed we would
forget that line and still in an extreme
attention-seeking are expressions of
trauma and we would get angry and punish
and yell where we should have support it
and calmed and understood we said things
that no kid wants to hear from a parent
things that were not true things that
were hurtful and then after a fight we
would look at them at night when they&#39;re
sleeping and hate ourselves we had to
apologize a lot one of the greatest
lessons that I learned and I think I&#39;m
still learning is the one of forgiving
myself and moving on after a parenting
failure and I think you do need to cut
yourself some slack some time I am
getting better though the period of
beating myself over the head has reduced
significantly
I learned to remind myself that I am
also a work
progress just like the kids are that not
perfect can be good enough that&#39;s a
scary thought
I learned to hope that the not perfect
family that they have will be good
enough for them and that one day we
might pay for their therapy and another
fear of ours in mind particular was what
if they turn out to be bad people
what if despite all our efforts they
walk astray what if their past is so
strong that it will define their future
in my imagination I almost heard people
telling me words like didn&#39;t we tell you
that nothing good will come out of that
or don&#39;t you know what the
responsibility that is you have to be
really prepared and it seem that
sometimes our kids did their best to
prove the point
they lied notoriously they stole things
from family members and friends they
miss school they broke things and never
acknowledged and that least can go on
and on and on at some point I even
thought that I became a lie expert I
could identify a person lying by the
slightest movement of eyes and the
change in the skin color and the breadth
and intensity I could know when you&#39;re
lying
I remember one instance after a long
conversation with one of my children
that line is very hurtful and a sincere
promise that it will never happen again
I found my pockets empty the next
morning I felt lost I felt angry
frustrated and yet with God&#39;s grace we
moved on but when I saw the deep
transformation in him and what kind of
person he became later I was so proud of
him
later I realized that those fears of
mine were normal fears for any dad
beautiful biological adopted a foster I
realized that we don&#39;t control their
destiny we don&#39;t control their choices
but we do control how much love and
affection we give them today they&#39;re
like hard soil that take much more
effort to grow anything on it but I want
to des grow it gives such a tremendous
joy and satisfaction self-talk is what
we do a lot in our family reminding
ourselves of the truth there are things
I can control and things I can&#39;t control
and I have a habit of mixing those two
so in order to survive the paralyzing
fears I have to constantly tell myself
the truth and focus on the good yes they
may not turn out the way I expect them
to or the way I think is right but have
I done what&#39;s in my power have I given
them the love or the affection have I
given them the family they&#39;re adults who
they can call their own so that later
when they grow up they can remember
sometimes with anger sometimes with
laughter sometimes with fondness this is
how my family did it instead of this is
what we did in the orphanage and another
fear of mine was will I have enough time
for myself I realized that every time we
were thinking about taking another child
I had to struggle with my inner self and
my selfishness thinking of it I thought
of that by the time we&#39;re done I&#39;ll be
65 and maybe I will have enough time to
live for myself then so I was very
curious what other dads have for me to
say about that and one advice in
particular was very useful it stated
don&#39;t sacrifice everything you like for
your children instead invite them to
join to join you in what you enjoy
so we travel long distances together we
play football or basketball we do
fishing we do homework we do cooking
altogether and to my surprise doing it
with them sometimes I enjoy it even more
than do it on their own and I make sure
that I do have time for myself every day
I need 20 to 30 minutes a day to be by
myself of course
20 to 30 minutes straight could be quite
a luxury so I&#39;ve learned to you to use
10 minutes 15 minutes here and there a
10 minute walk from school after I drop
the kids off there 15 minute reading of
a book or drinking a hot cup of tea five
minutes of a brainless phone game
recently I started jogging which in my
case is rather a shuffle but I am amazed
at how well it clears my head
I take the same if momma ain&#39;t happy
nobody&#39;s happy really seriously my
husband very smart guy once told me that
in this ocean of life we should stop
waiting until we reach the final
destination and rest then we should grab
onto little islands or pieces of wood
flat floating in the water where we
could rest for a little bit but
regularly I have taken this wise advice
to heart and for us in order to stay
sane we had to learn how to ask for help
and actually to be able to accept that
help in our case it really takes a
village to raise one child and we have
an amazing village even though we live
in the city our relatives and friends
are involved in helping us in many ways
from meals to babysitting
to growth promoting conversations with
our children from listening to us and
supporting us when we cry and complain
to rejoice in with us celebrating with
us when we rejoice we have heard again
and again that our limits are often
inside of us and that fares one of the
greatest limits although for us our life
does not seem to be live beyond limits
we have been given an opportunity to
work with some limiting fears
and this experience has been free and
enjoyable and satisfying and looking
back at everything we experienced and
knowing everything we know would we do
it again absolutely thank you
