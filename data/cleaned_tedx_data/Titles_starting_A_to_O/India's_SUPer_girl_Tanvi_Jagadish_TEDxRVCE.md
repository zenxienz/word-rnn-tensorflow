it was a usual day for me when I got the
most unusual phone call the excitement
at under of the car is hard to put into
words I couldn&#39;t contain my happiness
however the nervousness was much more
than the happiness fast for four months
I was in Fiji at the is a stand-up
paddling ball championship I saw 26
different flags in front of me that&#39;s
when it hit me my dream of representing
my country had finally come true the
whistle blew and the race began hello
everyone I am done with jeg this a
professional stand up paddler and a
surfer so when I introduce myself to
people this way the first question they
ask is what is that it&#39;s a sport surfing
and the very next retort is you are a
girl in the days of my early childhood
my dad you should take me to the beach
on Sundays it was a retreat but my only
enjoyment something about the waves
always clung on to me at the end my dad
always had a hard time pulling me out of
the water
only if he Nev back then I am the sea
where insufferable I was 10 years old
when my grandfather took me to the surf
ashram and my cousin where we would
learn to meditate do yoga swim and surf
he didn&#39;t inform my parents because they
would unnecessarily get worried the days
my grandfather would take me to surf
those days were the best days of my life
it was like heaven surfing is just not a
sport to me it is freedom it still is
freedom and a special bond with mother
ocean when I was a small kid I had
severe breathing problems and funnily
antibiotics didn&#39;t seem to work on me
you might find hard to believe saltwater
was my cure it cured me completely but
all this had downsides my mom comes to
know and the next moment I&#39;m at my house
beside a textbook and no surfer I was
completely heartbroken
three years three years I took to
convince my parents nothing about the
Indian parents&#39;s the love for the child
a security always blinds them for
child&#39;s desire and the same thing
happened with my parents and this was
understandable but the words you are a
girl always made me stronger
after all the struggle convincing my
parents they finally got convinced and I
won I was back at the ashram I was back
at DC that&#39;s when my journey of becoming
India&#39;s first female stand up paddler
began but wait what is stand up paddling
surfing was brought to India by surfing
Swami jack Hebner and my specialization
stand up paddling was brought to India
by a prison surfing is about riding
waves with a surfboard and stand up
paddling is done on a bigger surfboard
where we use paddle rather than hands
surfing has a basic picnic where you
paddle catch the wave and ride it it
might sound boring but you guys should
try it you will seriously love it
stand-up paddling can be done on legs
reverse ocean and all the way to riding
waves people see the world from the land
on firm ground but we stand apart let&#39;s
see the world from the water no ground
and ocean is a definition for playground
when I catch the wave the ocean does the
rest and I feel like on top of the world
this video will surely show you body
start up answer

surfing is one among the oldest sport
practiced on this planet and stand-up
paddling is the fastest-growing sport
right now but most of you guys sleeping
here are hearing for the first time
though India has a coastline of 7,500
kilometer people go abroad to learn
surfing when this sport was introduced
to our country 80% of the enrollees were
foreigners in our country we face a
tough situation of getting a new sport
into limelight and even a tougher task
of finding people who can perceive this
as a sport and there are so many reasons
we can go on and on but we need more
solutions so the first one is awareness
awareness is a key of developing any new
sport people should know su P exists
surfing competition conducting in our
country helps in raising bar like a
unique sport like a stupid
then comes knowledge people should know
what the sport is what its rules are
then only we can appreciate the
existence like we see in our country
like the underappreciated sports like
Kabaddi hockey and some other other
martial arts
the main reason the sports are dying is
because of lack of knowledge and ever
Ness then comes experience no sport can
be truly loved without experiencing it
so I encourage everyone let&#39;s begin with
the first step awareness and slowly move
up the ladder as I told you when the
sport was introduced to our country 80%
of the enrollees were foreigners but
it&#39;s changing 50% of Indians are surfing
in our own motherland everything is
improving the stats are also improving
but people still ask me this question
why are you wasting your time practising
a boy sport trust me this hurt is real
the ocean is for everybody
mother ocean treats everybody same and
age is just a number for her like when I
started this sport like a lot of people
challenged me and they told me challenge
them who
but for me it was all about proving
myself that I can do it because enough
after that I&#39;ve really worked hard like
the ocean has taught me has taught me
one very important value of my life
patience it is mentally and physically
made me very strong to waiting for the
sit waves to come catching the right one
and riding with it will make you
restless initially but the mother ocean
has a right way to teach her children
ever nice knowledge and experience
eventually got me to the beautiful
features beaches of Fiji
after winning five consecutive Nationals
in India I spent every moment revising
the rules in the international standard
for ACP we were supposed to take sand
from respective country to port to a
glass box in the World Championship the
beautiful layers of the sand symbolized
the unity which the sport represents I
knew my training had finally paid off
when the whistle at the I say stand up
paddling blew off I closed my eyes and
the past flashback I held my peril title
and the beginning of my most precious
moment of my life began my grandfather&#39;s
voice was playing in my head just do it
on me do it and I began paddling for the
long stretch of 18 kilometer race from
Cloudbreak to Muscat Kauai l&#39;m in the
hole cause they were this floating of
just college buoys which will guide the
participant throughout the course and
every buoy turn reminded me of the
people who believed me in india and
trained me back and this is a video
which happened in Fiji when I completed
the race

the future of this young sport lies in
our generation and I want to play an
active role in developing stand-up
paddling and surfing in India I have an
one Carrick&#39;s request with everybody
like everybody should experience the
ocean the way I have you will seriously
love it like people say ocean is scary
and all that when L tell you
ocean is something which is very
beautiful it&#39;s my deep desire to build a
team for this sport and to take to help
them to take to the grandest stage the
Olympics
[Applause]
