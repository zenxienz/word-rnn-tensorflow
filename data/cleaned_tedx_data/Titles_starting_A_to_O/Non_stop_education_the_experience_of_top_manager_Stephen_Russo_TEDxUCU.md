good morning so this morning I want to
start with it a bit of a challenge so
you heard the introduction I have about
32 years of experience in deep
technology and have seen some tremendous
changes in growth in the industry and
emerging capabilities that are in front
of us and I also have a solid foot in
the the spiritual world and in the
church so I have been a ordained Greek
Catholic Deacon for the last 13 years
and I practiced the two in a synergistic
way so I want to challenge you with some
some things to think about as you start
your day this morning first of all why
are you here and not just here in this
room but why are you here why are we
here
what impression do you want to leave
what do you want to leave behind I heard
it once said that it really doesn&#39;t
matter what you drive where you live
what you&#39;ve done but it&#39;s how you make
people feel and what you have left
behind in in your work so a couple
questions and I have some notes here
what is it as I said that you want to
leave behind what are your goals what
are your aspirations what do you intend
to do as students as teachers as
professionals we all need to support
ourselves to support our families but
what do we really want to leave behind
it&#39;s an interesting thing to think about
well given that this is a Catholic
University I want to to give you some
statistics about that the church itself
and what it has left behind do you
realize that the Catholic Church
throughout the world runs approximately
230 universities they run a hundred and
forty thousand schools that have been
created and run by the church over
10,000 orphanages 5,000 hospitals and 16
in health care clinics pretty tremendous
about what they&#39;ve done and why is
because those people who created those
institutions care for those others they
want to make a true change they really
want to change the world in some way and
they have in many ways if we see what&#39;s
happening in this institution and then
this is very building what is has been
emerging is really and truly amazing
I&#39;ve just been affiliated with the
University for about a year and a half
and have seen tremendous growth
tremendous change and growth and
inspiration in the young people in the
students in the professor&#39;s in what they
want to do they&#39;re giving all that they
have to really make a change and make a
difference so what do you want to do
what change do you want to make I want
to quote someone who you may have heard
of maybe not a gentleman who has his
long past and his name is Andrew
Carnegie by a show of hands has anybody
heard of Andrew Carnegie some have some
happened Andrew Carnegie was an
immigrant to the United States around
the turn of the century he came from
Scotland and he had nothing more than
the bag that was in his hand holding
some clothes when he came to the u.s. he
became a multi-millionaire and at the
time what he made was approximately
equivalent to I think they said about 60
billion dollars u.s. dollars today so a
very wealthy man and he died almost
penniless and not because he squandered
all his money and couldn&#39;t manage it
well in his later years but what he
wanted to do is truly make a difference
I want to share a quote with you from
mr. Carnegie one of the things that he
said says there is no use whatsoever
trying to help someone who does not want
to help themselves if you think about
that what Andrew Carnegie wanted to
donate he wanted to make a difference
but he didn&#39;t just want to feed people
he didn&#39;t just want to give his money
away what he wanted to do is use
his wealth to make a difference and what
he did is he created a number of
organizations that would help people
improve themselves he donated to
universities he created libraries he
created theaters for the arts he created
all different ways across many different
disciplines for people to improve
themselves he wanted his money to live
on to be used again so that generation
after generation after generation could
make a difference and make some sort of
improvement in the world well all of us
our tasks
to make some sort of improvement in the
world another statistic if you have a
roof over your head and you sleep in a
bed and you&#39;ve had at least one meal a
day you are better off than 87% of the
people on the face of the earth
that&#39;s pretty amazing
we think about how many people need help
how many people really are so have such
a difficult lives and what we can do so
a lot has been done and a lot more can
be done and with the growth of a
university like this and in all the
inspiration that you have what
difference do you want to make what
changes in the world do you want to make
and right here by another show of hands
who thinks that by what you&#39;re doing you
can change the world that&#39;s it
you&#39;re all modest there&#39;s two hands okay
he&#39;s gonna really make a difference all
of you can change the world all of you
can truly make a difference if you think
about what can be done through
technology through new innovation
through many different aspects of
building on all the generations that
have gone before us to really make a
difference to really make a change I had
an opportunity last night to to meet
some new friends and have dinner with a
colleague of mine here and we had
conversations and these were two people
who came from one from a technology
background and one from actually a
theology background that went into
technology and they are making money
they have a company that they have
started doing well they&#39;re gaining more
contracts but they really wanted to
understand well what could be done to
really help people what could be done to
really change things how could they use
their own assets funds money how could
they encourage others to use it how
could they help with creating technology
solutions that may enable the creation
of medical schools of hospitals of other
facilities that can truly help people
well if we think about things that
happen around the world many things that
we look at that are just absolutely
amazing were created because someone had
a vision going to the ancient times if
we look at some of the great monuments
in Greece in Egypt in Rome throughout
the world they were created because
someone had a vision someone wanted to
make some grapes change if he talked
about a hundred years ago with Alexander
Graham Bell in the creation of the
telephone that we would soon have these
devices these little devices that would
be wireless and we&#39;d carry them
everywhere and most people would spend
90% of their time staring at them what
could we do as far as communicating with
anyone anywhere in the world practically
they would say it&#39;s impossible because
they dreamed big they wanted to make
something change I had a mentor of mine
and I encourage all of you to have
mentors to have someone who may inspire
you someone who you may see as making a
difference and learn from them learn and
how to make changes and a mentor as I
was growing up who told me you always
need to shoot for perfection and shoot
for the top because if you don&#39;t shoot
for perfection and you don&#39;t shoot for
the top you&#39;ll never even get to
mediocre if you shoot from mediocre
maybe you&#39;ll get there and you&#39;ll
probably end up less so you may never
get to perfection but you have to think
big and understand what you want to do
what changes do you want to make mr.
Carnegie also had another quote that I
want to share with you he said you are
what you think so just think big believe
big act big work big give big forgive
big laugh big love big and live big well
there&#39;s one common word throughout that
is thinking of how to live big so this
young boy who came to a country that was
just forming with almost nothing really
thought big lived big and what he left
behind
was very big and it&#39;s important as we
think about this to really be
well-rounded and it&#39;s one of the reasons
when they asked me to speak this morning
I could talk to you about all kinds of
new and emerging technologies all kinds
of trends in the industry that I&#39;m part
of but I wanted to take more of a
broader view as you think big and as you
as individuals are here because you want
to increase your intellectual knowledge
contribute to the knowledge base of
humanity but at the same time are you
also thinking about the spiritual aspect
of your being how are you encouraging
that if you can&#39;t be well within
yourself you can&#39;t help anyone and you
can&#39;t do anything someone once asked me
as well what is the most important thing
in life and coming from a religious
background the answer is always God
because we can&#39;t take one breath we
can&#39;t be here without the grace of God
the next thing what&#39;s next and people
might say oh my family my children my
girlfriend my my wife no it&#39;s you as an
individual and that&#39;s not being selfish
but you have to maintain and understand
and be well within yourself and through
that grace of God and that ability to be
well within yourself is what requires
the attention to the spiritual aspect of
your life and then the third aspect of
course is the physical if we are not
able to do what we need to do if we&#39;re
not able to think clearly and we&#39;re not
able to be in good health it is
difficult to do anything else so it&#39;s
important that we take care of our
physical selves and the three come
together the mind the body and the
spirit and neither and none of them can
be neglected because they all need to
come together to make that whole person
so that you can truly make a difference
and you can think big act big and live
big and what you leave behind hopefully
will be big there&#39;s another individual
that I want to share with you that some
of you may heard everything
it was in Italian and he is up for
canonization in the church he has been
declared a blessed and his name is
blessed peer friend Theatre Giorgio
frascati
has anybody heard of him I&#39;m thinking
they&#39;re probably not many Father you
have yes blessed pier Giorgio was an
interesting individual he came from a
rather wealthy family
and his father wanted him to do great
things and take over his business he
wanted to be an engineer and he wanted
to be an engineer at the time a civil
engineer and an industrial engineer so
that he could help the people in that
were working in the mines that had very
difficult jobs and this individual he
was a lively individual and very
inspiring to young people so I encourage
many of our young people here to go to
youtube and look him up and watch some
of the videos about him they don&#39;t have
a lot of time to talk about his his life
here and this individual unfortunately
he died at a rather young age but when
he died and the town heard about it
thousands and thousands of people showed
up to his funeral his family had
absolutely no idea what he was doing
when he wasn&#39;t working he was out
helping people he was helping widowed
mothers with their children
he was helping sick individuals on how
they could become well he was making
money and buying medicine to help others
when he was on his deathbed he asked
someone to take medicine to various
people and because he had promised that
he would help them so when he died
thousands of people showed up that he
helped because they knew him and his
family was absolutely shocked to see the
turnout because they had absolutely no
idea and yet at the same time this
individual if you read about him he was
a hiker he was a skier he was a great
athlete he was always trying to have fun
with friends and he was a very lively
person but what he did quietly was to
try to change the world and he had a
phrase that he used it&#39;s an italian
phrase which goes versal Alto verso Alto
means to the top
to get to the top and that vision of
trying to strive to get to the top and
in a verse that he used he said to live
without faith without a heritage to
defend without battling constantly for
truth is not to live at all but to just
get along and we must never just get
along and he said the higher you go the
better you shall hear the voice of
Christ so the higher you go the higher
you strive for the more you can hear the
voice of Christ but we can&#39;t just get
along in our lives what we need to do is
we need to strive for the top that verse
so Alto to get to the very top and that
doesn&#39;t mean to get to the top on the
backs and pushing others aside but that
is together as a team
how we work to improve humanity to
improve our surroundings and each and
every one of you can in fact and will in
fact change the world but what will you
leave behind what will you do and what
will your own legacies be your legacy is
while you&#39;re still here and your legacy
while you&#39;re gone there are many people
that have been involved in the creation
of this institution and that are still
involved to expand it and to help and to
make it grow and why because they truly
want to make a difference I will tell
you the priests the bishops the others
the donors here many of them are not
doing it for monetary gain because if
they wanted to do it for monetary gain
they could do many other things in
creating a large businesses and maybe
your role in life is to create business
and to be able to use what you have
created to help others maybe your role
in life is to be a teacher maybe your
role in life is to be a doctor maybe to
be an engineer maybe to create the new
and most innovative technologies that
are out there today and to really change
the world in some way but you really
need to
think about how are you and how do you
want to change the world what difference
do you want to make so as you go through
the presentations today and through the
week and as you begin your studies this
year constantly think and every day how
you can make yourself that much better
it&#39;s important and I find in the
corporate world you have many many
different types of personalities I have
the opportunity to deal with people in
many different parts of the world and
many different personalities and one of
the the qualities I see that is very
important and unfortunately rather rare
is to see that constant and daily
ability to re-evaluate yourself what
have you done what have you what can you
do better what can you change to do
something in maybe a more efficient way
a better way a better way to treat
people but that constant self-evaluation
is key and that constant self-evaluation
allows you to continually climb to
continually move to that next level to
get to that verso Alto to get to the top
to climb to the top so I leave you with
that thought of what are you going to do
to change the world
