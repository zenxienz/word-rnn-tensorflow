and relationships can be incredibly
tough at times frustrating and even
painful we can actually find the person
that we&#39;re most supposed to love the
most annoying person incredibly
frustrating and even at time you can&#39;t
stand to be in the same room as that
other person but if we have a huge
amount of joy fuckin pleasure a company
relationship those connections these
bridges that we build with other people
whether that&#39;s our partners our family
our friends or even our work colleagues
and they bring us comfort and support in
good times and bad and when they were
these bridges have been credibly
important for us now pleased to say that
the evidence base is overwhelming with
good quality relationships of good for
our health and our well-being one
research founder and poor quality
relationships with the equipment that&#39;s
making 15 cigarettes a day so when they
do they&#39;re really good for us but answer
as a collective of people in the room
today we actually lived through the
greatest revolution in our relationship
ever
when we find organizing and our
relationships have been for profound set
of changes since the nineteen sixties
and they strangers have been social
political economic and technological and
we&#39;ve disrupted the way we find
organizing and our relationships and
today people are charting new courses
for their relationships in our local
society are often without a roadmap to
guide them and how they build these
bridges with other people now I&#39;m the
chief executive of relates and you might
have some assumptions about my
organization that we only work with
married couples that we only work with
heterosexual couples and the only work
with couples for children but in fact
we&#39;ve actually been at the forefront of
this relationship revolution we&#39;ve seen
firsthand in the cat&#39;s in brief how
these changes have impacted on
individuals couples families know
and our cat certain we have 1500 of them
across the country have been very much
the forefront of this revolution
well that&#39;s challenges that have always
been there like money worries were
having an affair
through to new challenges that our
founders have never expected to see such
as addiction online extreme pornography
or digital infidelity we have an affair
to somebody you can actually be in the
same rhythm and needs to place huge
trades on these important bridges and
it&#39;s our cats as you&#39;ve seen that
firsthand now my talk today had been
fooled by that experience over the past
seventy nine years and we&#39;d not be
immune to those changes my organization
set up in 1938 I think we could have
imagined that the organization today
will be led by an openly gay
30-something divorcee
certainly not the National Merit
guidance Council so we&#39;re trying to
think about how we as an organization
respond in this new world what
information support people might want to
guide that as they build those bridges
and today I&#39;m going to talk about these
preparing social economic political and
technological changes how do you society
respond to them and how his individuals
families and a society can do more to
nurture those important types of bridges
that cs3 the bike course so what have we
seen well let&#39;s start off with social
change we&#39;ve seen a real shift since the
1950s most of us in the room today in
the 1950s would have been married and we
would be married at the average age of
21 to think about that for a second
today marriage rates are declining
significantly and the fastest rise in
demography is cohabiting couples
followed by lone parent households and
today less than half of us are married
whereas in the 1950s the vast majority
us would have been married we&#39;re having
children married and buying houses much
later than previous innovations the
1950s and also parenting differently
half of children by the time they
succeed will no longer live with both
birth parents in the UK today that&#39;s a
little shit what would happen in the
1950s now I don&#39;t think no judgment
about these strangers that we&#39;ve seen in
our society and I think actually much to
celebrate in a liberal society about how
to organize upend our relationships but
I don&#39;t apply techniques you very
wonderful book for the way never work
which is American families and the
nostalgia track she argues that today we
can form into type of romanticizes in
the palace and creates a false
perception that somehow Hagi&#39;s were
perfect into the past until liberalism
and individualism came along and changed
and turned those wonderful families into
dysfunctional families because of that
rise in business but in that golden age
of marriage in the 1950s problems such
as domestic abuse marital rape were
never spoken about but we even created a
nice little suburban erases well we gave
medications women to keep them happy at
home because as soon as we&#39;re married or
have children you&#39;re expected to meet
the workplace so much has changed from
today we become and much more
opportunities in our society about how
we organize our relationships and what&#39;s
also shit dudes we have much great
expectations of equality in each other
in a relationship today and it&#39;s also
much greater diversity and acceptance of
hanging organizer relationships whether
that same-sex couples if they can get
married which is wonderful whether you
make a choice to live together apart
couples who choose not to have children
or people who make a conscious choice to
be single so there&#39;s more choice more
options but not necessarily a road map
to guide you on how you embark upon
these creases in the bridges that you
create so alongside that social takes
we&#39;ve seen the factory canonic change
and the economy is that&#39;s huge influence
on our relationships we&#39;ve just lived
through the greatest recession since the
Great Depression with the nineteen
twenties and from our research we found
that those who were hardest hit
great reception what eight times more
likely to see their couple relationships
break up than they seem very well we
know that intuitively when money&#39;s tight
it creates more arguments when you use
with job based hopes extreme that
quality those household renovations we
were going to do don&#39;t happen anymore
but couples today are struggling to
reconcile that decide an expectation of
social equality with rising economic
uncertainty and inequality and he works
crazy to though that one in five couples
and they relate can see me today
hope backward if you would be brick six
so we see that uncertainty in the
council in the world but also in happy
economic change let&#39;s go back to the
nineteen fifties you can support a house
of the family with one with a cop&#39;s job
whether that was Public Administration
on teaching today couple thicknesses so
you have that choice anymore
and they want that choice so we don&#39;t we
can&#39;t support that household we just
want income anymore and we see that
that&#39;s changing the bowls that parents
play in couple relationships as well
we&#39;ve seen a massive rise in number of
returned breadwinners one in three
mothers today with children with an
opposite sex Department of a main
breadwinner in that household and that&#39;s
doubled over the past 20 years increase
in every single social demographic in
our society profound social technology
well technology has completely change
the way we find
organize and relationships but you know
we know today but actually one of the
top three ways to meet something today
is act like tinder right that rough or
whatever the latest innovation on the
market is we so many people through work
connections and a three-ton some camps
and friends that technology&#39;s been an
important part there but also this idea
of privacy social media has come into
our family lights in a way
imagine you know you just need to look
at Facebook from Kristin saying to see
the pictures of all the bass huge piles
of presents in the wonderful dinner but
never the pictures of the argument
because somebody didn&#39;t get what they
want
or the fact that actually happened in on
their own on Christmas Day so we&#39;re not
necessarily giving a sense of our real
self through technology so I&#39;m going to
do now to talk about our politics
because actually our politics hasn&#39;t
kept pace of these changes and have
actually struggled to provide some of
the offices and you can see that
politics that we almost have a polarized
debate about relationships and family
like those important bridges eventually
as well on the right we see that the
ideas of traditional family values
marriage being seen as a indicator of
good quality relationship and a key
component of the single and civilized
society and on the right we still pick
up that skepticism about cohabitation
and sex outside marriage as somehow a
threat to social stability and on the
left that liberal do we pick up which is
Family Values a liberal view of Family
Values objecting marriage in marriage as
a patriarchal backdated institution and
a much stronger focus on equality of the
sexes in diversity of relationship types
and a much greater focus on the
importance of the individual some of the
nipple that even question whether couple
relationships and survivors an
institution into the future and emotion
this phase out in our politics today
you can almost both rise and you hear a
politician talking about family
structures and personal responsibility
they&#39;re typically from the right and if
you get someone talking about economic
structures and impact on family life
they&#39;re typically from the left with the
left being agnostic about family
structures and focusing on base economic
structures even more so at the current
leadership now this debate about parts
of agency and structure is at the heart
of fiscal debate today about families
and that&#39;s important why it&#39;s important
is because our politics dictates who we
marry
Hannibal&#39;s on the basis of the courses
we still have a whole base of all system
because politics does influence how we
structure our relationships it also
influences the kind of financial support
that you might receive really welfare
savings so we do need to move beyond
this polarize debate because actually
the left and the right is half right
half wrong on the debate where the right
is right is that all those changes I
talked about how I can impact on family
life today and it has greatest rings
there which why relationships those
important bridges families in a
friendship should be a public policy
priority it&#39;s an issue that can&#39;t be
ignored because he sees from the impacts
rate but equally on the Left we actually
like to see the focus on choice and
diversity rather than the state saying
that&#39;s a good way to organize a
relationship that is it and recognizing
what we have to loosen by versity about
relationships
some people may make the wrong choices
now those changes are talked about in
our economy in our society offset
against much much higher expectations of
our relationships today than we did in
the nineteen fifties in our Mexican in
the nineteen fifties we didn&#39;t talk
about working at our relationship we got
married and you say marries it&#39;s a much
different conversation today and we
expect so much more and some of that
panics roots in the ideas of Romanticism
we want the person that we love with to
be the best loved to be the best parent
to be great at housework and to make a
really good meal and we expect so much
more and there&#39;s a question I&#39;ll get
second about our expectations too high
my son&#39;s too high and can you really
tell with that through a team before a
grinder spread birthday now we have the
approach for relationships there are two
schools of thoughts first of all is a
fatalistic huge had its origins in Greek
mythology
Plato symposium Aristophanes where he
talked about finding over Hull and
finding that other half has its
connotations in are apparent about
you know the other half that completes
us and even that view which is much more
fatalistic it treats us as individuals
of passive de News&#39;s of our autonomy and
subjects of surveys will some of the
cosmic force in how successful our
relationship is going to be if it&#39;s
right we&#39;ll be right here&#39;s the one and
it will be fine
it also accounts for the cult of Sigma
around seeking help for relationships
and they go off but there is another
school of thought which is a much more
developmental to do which is where we
see that we can learn to grow by having
relationships it&#39;s the best way to learn
how to have relationship is to have
relationships to build those bridges
with other people and they sleep quality
relationships don&#39;t just happen they
require us co-creating them with another
individual or with our families or with
our friends and that that gate is much
more active and it&#39;s a belief that
relationships can change and they can be
better and he texted me people who
operate developmental you find that many
people can be the one and that they&#39;re
much more likely to seek help when
things don&#39;t go the way they can with
the way they should do and it also seems
that relationships is not something that
we arrive on earth
perfect informed to have but seems
building and fostering and sustain those
important bridges as a key life skill
now I&#39;m not making this up there was an
interesting survey published by the Open
University and yet I&#39;ve seen people been
doing love we looked at what makes a
long-term relationship sustained and
then they found that small acts of
kindness with a thing that was most
valued and sing about by participants
and episode things like bringing your
partner a cup of tea into the bedroom in
the morning bussiness a much much more
valuable thing the dramatic gesture of
the Train rates of Harrison with a huge
romantic dinner all the time to take
flowers and in fact saying thank you to
that other person of those thoughtful
Dexter whether it be a little next to
somebody with much more highly prized in
those long-term relation
and they speak from extra pressures so
building bridges today is much more
complex than it was for our previous
generations but it&#39;s also harder because
of this huckleberry architecture about
which prevents us from seeking help we
have this sense in our society that
relationships are a private space and
this issue around shipment and shame
about talking about things and they
don&#39;t go wrong prevents us from seeking
support and there&#39;s one serving in the
United States and said people will live
with the distressed relationship after
six years before they don&#39;t see a
relationship counselor and the UK isn&#39;t
too dissimilar from that we know people
will wait in our services three four
five six seven years for pork LCpl and
that&#39;s in sunny because our research
shows in the deepening today one in five
of us 2.8 7 billion people is living in
a distressed relationship so we need to
change the conversation so we want to
nap to those regions there&#39;s things that
we can do as individuals and things we
can do as a society so what can we do
individually first of all is working on
communication service the public will
tell us the biggest rally public
relationships is money worries but our
paths have had a very different view
overwhelming consensus both 1500 passes
is that poor communication and lack of
empathy is the biggest strength on
couple relationships today and on
families so working on that
communication that non-defensive
positive communication the win-win
solutions rather than women lose
situations with another person and work
on your listening skills communication
isn&#39;t just workers it&#39;s diable the
second thing is do things together that
you love tinyface interests you can work
with somebody else whether that&#39;s
getting yo the parts of the genome or
cooking or into a film together buying
this opportunity and meat in time for
them we do see couples where they&#39;ve
both got the laptops on in the bedroom
and maybe that would be White&#39;s impacts
on the sex workers but the laptops
outside the bedroom well taken
but 13 it&#39;s important in this that is to
create space yourself how can you know
what you want from another person if you
don&#39;t mingle self that well so finding
opportunities need to reflect and think
and that doesn&#39;t mean tweeting that
means actually having some space to
think see well as a key skill and
something to be nurtured relationships
can be better if we work that fatalists
in you as a different developmental we
can learn we see it as a key skill and
the final one for us individuals is to
seek support early don&#39;t wait for those
small issues complete fractures in the
relationship the seamy seek support the
more those issues can be resolved but
isn&#39;t just about individuals in this
debate it&#39;s also have policymakers in
our national conversations so you do
need to think differently about how we
nurture those important bridges they
have vital connections with others and
that starts the school now please we&#39;ve
finally got registered change that all
young people have access to relationship
education but we also need to debate
those affect we also need to connect
sorry those debates that technology the
economy with what&#39;s happening in our
family lives they don&#39;t operate in
factories and actually our economy and
that social thing does impact on all of
these vital bridges this connections
with others but equally our family life
our relationships impacts on the economy
then we came to spend more on white kids
it would be the university there is an
impact there is a basis to debates are
actually intubated we need to think
about that way so we need to see
building those vital bridges as eat life
still the company nurtures
because we do want this connection
that&#39;s a overriding theme across 79
years and what my connection with
somebody else what those connections to
be better and they can be we net not
check and invest in them and if we
develop those skills if we nurture them
and we&#39;ll be better able to navigate all
the changes that we&#39;re going
see and my two-year-old Nachman Theo&#39;s
gonna see when he&#39;s my age and first
fighting this time these are the best
people to navigate those changes if we
know so still and we relate we&#39;ll
continue to adapt and change so that we
nurture information skills for the next
seven to nine news
