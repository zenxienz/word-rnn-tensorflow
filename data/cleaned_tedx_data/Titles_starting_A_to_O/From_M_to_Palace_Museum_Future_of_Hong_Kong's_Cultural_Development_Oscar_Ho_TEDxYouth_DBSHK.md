hi thank you for inviting me to these
taxes talk I&#39;m not sure but my aunt
might not talk like that they like
speaker but to be honest I don&#39;t care I
just follow one more basic principle
about giving public talk he just speak
with my heart
nothing does he says so I came back to
Hong Kong after studying for 10 years in
North America and when I first came back
when cultural phenomenon really
disturbed me and that is all the people
I talk to would describe Hong Kong as a
cultural desert for anyone just feel a
little bit knowledge of apology you know
when there is people there is culture
you don&#39;t even need to know if apology
just take the bus
long live and ROI at night or walk
around Hong Kong you know you were
amazed how colorful how rich how
distinctive Hong Kong culture is the
other thing that really annoyed me was
that I realized that most of the young
artists in Hong Kong were making up for
the New York greeting instead of using a
language understood by the local all of
these phenomenas refrigerator already
complex or certain aisle it&#39;s not and
it&#39;s understandable because ELISA
covered call earlier tactic to undermine
the cultural identity of the locals and
he said they were highlight the culture
of the colonizer having too strong a
sense of local culture identity is
politically dangerous in Hong Kong case
of course it was about adoring and
admiring but his culture and his
extension Delhi&#39;s Western culture know
at this point I have to highlight one
thing because when we talk about local
culture we could easily fall into this
Sim simplify the fall out the suppressor
and suppress the good and the bad they
ask you a lot of wonderful stuff we
should learn for the west from the
beaches
I mean don&#39;t over simplify it but at the
same time they are also good faith about
ourselves that we should not ain&#39;t know
after I pick up my job and exhibition
director of the Hong Kong Rock Center
indeed I brought in a lot of Western and
Asian exhibition to Hong Kong because I
feel because I felt they were very
important and did some what they were
really excellent but at the same time I
start to focus on Hong Kong Hong Kong
culture that deal our research in this
area up to that point there were hot any
research
about Hong Kong Hong Kong cultures as I
did the research I was amazed by how
colorful how strong Hong Kong culture is
just given some example the first
political cartoonist in the history of
modern China he said I call him see he&#39;s
from Hong Kong snake chain dynasty the
first artist who went in China in
Chinese history who went overseas to
study Western painting it says was this
guy lady full he actually live in Hong
Kong for the 30 and 40s and home in fact
when should be home with a Hong Kong
it was so amazed to find that there was
this poor artists living in oh how could
be such a fantastic painter then you
know he finally some unbelievable Hong
Kong will have an artist like that in
the history of modern Chinese design the
only two person have studied at the
famous German school the Bauhaus one of
them is this guy called tell hall I bet
most of you they know are these
important figures the important Rogers
for Hong Kong in a whole history a
modern China they bring were significant
role if we expand our definition of our
own culture and includes popular culture
the sky&#39;s the limit
it&#39;s truly amazing to come pop more
important even Uncle Phil where Bruce
Lee we have walked away
we have Stephen Chow we have jungle no
they they found a whole world of the
creation how can we say we have no
culture how can we call Hong Kong a
cultural desert when I was invited in
2006 to help to plan the museum for West
Kowloon cultural district we worked
really hard and conceived the idea of
Empress Musa butyl on the one hand was
so distinctive up our Empress when
Empress was planted it was this it was
the space devoted to Hong Kong culture
and we highlight the pond we highlight
the statement that it should be a Museum
of Hong Kong focus with emphasis on
popular cult culture and visual culture
Hong Kong and fortunately my dream or
our dream disappear really soon was the
support of West Kowloon employs a whole
team top Western experts and when I came
in this town opening a lobster
yes they did they do look in Haitian
love but it&#39;s not endorsed by the West
so they haven&#39;t made me the major
collection with a collection of Chinese
contemporary are those artists who were
known in the West once again and this is
what they really said is this kind of
colonial mindset still retained and we
still look for excellency from somewhere
else is telling yourself of course I
understand for museum like m+ of such a
big scale we need expert but only
someone expected they would set up some
research team some sort of assess
mechanism to get to know about how
better unfortunately it didn&#39;t happen
very circle I have a palace with zoom
from Beijing so what&#39;s gonna happen is
that we&#39;re gonna have a micelle of
Chinese Asian up but the other some have
Museum of Chinese contemporary art where
is Hong Kong
and everyday never the disappearing of
local culture is even more alarming
partly because of urban development but
because of how indifference the fish
border sell mine are quickly
disappearing
soon soon we can only see the change
fast restore all food truck as his very
best in financial school I remembered
years ago as a primary section I can&#39;t
buy some fish boy survive and have a
nice chili sauce and if we put on top of
it I always enjoy those so my firstborn
well my wife is gossiping with the I are
the parents
somehow the shop disappear as replaced
by a typical fast-food place we need to
reclaim respect and revitalize our
disappearing culture and you don&#39;t need
to be an expert or scholar to do that
what you need to do is you start to look
seriously learn to appreciate the
uniqueness of Hong Kong culture then you
find at home at school industry try to
think outside of the conventional and
very limiting definition of culture and
you&#39;ll be surprised how it&#39;s a culture
we have it&#39;s time to bring back that
sensibility to be proud of what we have
and to hoard something valuable that
will disappear
we&#39;re Asuna me do not take action right
away
Hong Kong is not a cultural desert he
can stand only so proudly and it is up
to you to prove it
thank you
[Applause]
