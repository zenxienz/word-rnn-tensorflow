this is how you normally see a captain
but today I&#39;m here as a man not as a
captain so I will put this on a chariot
I will try to take you on a small
journey inside my head and my colleagues
do so I won&#39;t all of you to start with
to close your eyes and try to transport
yourself to the Caribbean Sea not the
azure blue sea you&#39;re used to but a grey
one a dark one with lots of clouds on
board a small cruise ship it&#39;s a very
cloudy morning and the air is strangely
electrically charged with something
dangerous completely stable and it sees
like a mirror or a leak on its distilled
afore the storm a gigantic wall of rain
is coming towards the ship - its 1979
hurricane David is coming it&#39;s the
deadliest or hurricane since 18 1834
leaving over 2,000 dead 400,000
evacuated and more than 2 million people
without electricity or water as a young
man I was on board this cruise ship in
the middle of this horrible class 5
hurricane and even if many storms and
hurricanes has passed by since then most
recently here ma who say Katya and Mario
among the greatest fear any seaman has
to is to end up in the middle of a
monster storm like this being a ship
captain and a human being your fear is
something that affects me every day and
in order to talk about how seamen or any
one of us for that matter react when we
go beyond fear I will need to talk about
fear in general first fear is the
fight-or-flight response to our minds
react to a possible dangerous ongoing
situation or a future situation with
ourselves as the main person it is 2
steps beyond being scared afters
after scare comes afraid and then comes
fear people get scared or afraid of many
things in life from past events from
Smith&#39;s sounds sudden movements or
something we see you even feel we were
afraid from that we are afraid from the
time we are a small children I used to
have nightmares about a lion that would
eat me up that&#39;s not a very very big
problem in Sweden when the poor bugger
would probably freeze to death before
you have me for lunch
or I was afraid of falling down from a
skyscraper and I always woke up either
in my bed or after that just after I
fell out of it but it felt like 40
floors as we grow up we are afraid of
other things if not making it in life
how we perform at work not being loved
or even successful we are afraid of not
having enough money to make ends meet or
losing our job in order to be scared of
something we must learn to fear it it
was to fall down to drown to burn to be
hurt the more we know about something
the more we will know the consequences
if something does go wrong for me is the
captain and my crew to have a fire on
board capsize collision pirates or to go
aground but as a person I think about my
family
are they well my kids are a healthy and
happy I school worked going well or do
they have friends or my wife for her
parents okay what if someone dies when
we&#39;re in the middle of the Pacific Ocean
or get sick or badly hurt these are some
of my everyday fears about a ship a ship
you know it&#39;s a very isolated human
outpost the majority of the world&#39;s
fleet still have no internet imagine a
small village of about 20 to 30 people
out in the South Pole normally only men
we can&#39;t go to the movies to this mall
to the supermarket or the beach we work
read books watch videos and speaks to
the family if we do have in that if we
don&#39;t have internet we call home once a
week for about 10 euros a minute or
maybe we have a short conversation over
a scratchy public radio that everyone
else can be
and two Devils isolated outpost the ship
just to be there also creates personal
fear like being afraid of not being
accepted on board to do some mistake or
to die without being able to see the
kids or the family again we as humans
all of you and all of us seamen we deal
with our fears every day but when we are
on board a ship we can&#39;t call the police
the fire department to go to the doctor
if we have an emergency we have to
deliver it ourselves so if we are scared
of big storms fire and many other things
how do we make sure we can meet that day
if it ever comes so all sea men train on
different scenarios all officers have
courses many courses and we learn from
the first time we set foot on deck as a
young crew member to think ahead just to
try to see dangers before they come we
go to courses ashore and we use the team
on board as one unit so how do we react
when your own thinkable happens so we
how we react on a personal level is
mostly depending on two factors
our ability to fantasize or knowledge
and our knowledge of facts
if the fantasizing part takes over a
reptile brain will trigger a hormonal
shower or adrenaline and rule our
actions in response to what our fantasy
creates panic horror even freeze or
paralysis
some people have it in them to flee no
matter what the consequences they will
hide in a closet or even jump out of an
open window during a fire without
understanding that there are there are
normally ways to survive even in such
difficult places some very few people
they just give up sit down
cry loose all will to live and fight but
most people conquer their fear keep
their heads called and many times they
do find a way out most of them have the
same feeling during this worst moments
they know they could well die but then
there is no way out but they deal with
it how it&#39;s a in a few cases it&#39;s a
natural ability this some people just
won&#39;t get panicked but mainly it&#39;s done
by cognition which is to say our
knowledge
experiences understanding and training
the less new a situation in Istanbul for
me the more familiar it is and the less
chance it is that that you will lose
control over it
airplane pilots biggest fear is to lose
control over the airplane in midair yet
when one listens to nearly all black box
conversations or recordings they
continue to try they&#39;re saved they
airplane until they are down in the
ground or in the water if you remember
their landing on Hudson River a few
years ago in New York the plane was hit
by birds and they lost both engines the
last words the captain said to his
colleagues was any other suggestions
copilot and they then landed and
everybody survived in this case so ship
captains and our crews have the same
problem as airplane pilots we&#39;re both
stuck in a little Cuba metal and only we
can solve the problem at hand training
experience these are key words to be
able to go beyond fear and stay focused
when we repeatedly train on some
procedure or exposed to a dangerous
environment like a storm or or being
only Intracoastal during a big ship they
get used to it we learn how to ship
reacts we learn from all the captains
and colleagues how to handle the ship
safely we train on firefighting lifeboat
drills and pirate attacks all of this we
have to know but there are two more
items and in my opinion the most
important of all never lose faith and
hope if there&#39;s hope there&#39;s a way if
there is faith there&#39;s belief and
without hope and faith nothing can work
when were inside of a hurricane it is
very hard to explain to people ashore
the incredible forces we are exposed to
even during a normal-size storm the
ship&#39;s I command
there are 300 meters long and about 50
meters wide the distance from the water
to the wheelhouse for we control the
ship is about 50 meters it&#39;s a very big
ship it&#39;s more than 100,000 tons the
engine is about 40,000 horsepower and we
can do speeds in calm seas over 20 knots
that&#39;s about 40 kilometers per hour but
it&#39;s fast for a ship
one would think that such a giant ship
could not move so much but it moves its
moves much more than you can imagine it
does a normal storm in Atlantic in the
Atlantic Ocean will produce about 10 to
12 meter high waves a severe storm about
12 to 15 meters and I go through these
storms one sort a couple of times a year
so statistically I have four tiers at
sea I have about forty to sixty storms
and about five to six hurricanes four
cyclones
during my career during such storms I
have very big respect for the waves and
the wind we make sure we don&#39;t get run
over by the waves we keep the ship
against to see and slow the speed and
wait for the storm to pass but sometimes
those five or six times we encounter
that hurricane that we really fear with
wind speeds of the more than a double or
normal storm or actually triple or four
times and more than sometimes double
hurricane force with waves that I really
fear the force is so great I understand
with more attention once they can break
my ship like a dry twig in the wind if
she is mishandled even if these ships
are very strongly built waves are like I
said of the 15 meters in a normal storm
but the waves I&#39;m talking about now
there are about from 16 to 26 meters
something like this it&#39;s not only the
height of the waves that you have to
think of it&#39;s also the length between
the wave crests the horizontal wave
their normal storms about 40 to 80
metres between the crests these monsters
have 82 about four maybe 500 meters it
means that these incredibly steep waves
break over the ship and when several
hundreds or even thousands of tons
enters the deck it breaks things even
with big hatches of the ship crush
windows not to mention hurt people on
deck overboard like an ad flushed away
in a torrential rain and I to get scared
really scared scared for my crew and the
safety of my ship
some maybe one or two of us on board may
then succumb to fear and breakdown and
stop working they just wait for the ship
to they think they will break up and
they called mother or even God it&#39;s then
then I realize the burden and the duty
to be a sea captain it enters my body
and I realize that I&#39;m alone is I&#39;m
responsible for this little world of
mine for all the life&#39;s award and for
their families to see them safely back
home again there&#39;s nothing I can do
about the size of the waves order or the
strength or the wind so I look out there
at the sea surrounding my great 300
meter ship now reduced to a small metal
cork flung around like the leaf in
autumn wind and I understand that we are
just tiny little beings without meaning
and that there is a big possibility that
we might make wonder if I don&#39;t control
the movements of the ship I see that
there are powers so much bigger than us
and that there is there must be a God up
there to guard over us so then with all
my fear inside I go to that place where
it passed beyond fear when my training
experience seamanship faith and hope
takes over so I get filled with a very
strange kind of peace I get calm and
determined to get my ship safely through
to our dear ones and to do whatever it
takes to get us home I do the only thing
I can do I&#39;ve reduced feet I put the bow
into the waves and as much as possible
control the movements of the vessels to
ride the hurricane out I know that most
of my crew are with me and they do their
utmost to keep the engine going to keep
lookout serve food if that&#39;s possible in
that weather the engineers and specially
the chief engineer must keep the engine
running for without that I cannot
maneuver sometimes the propeller comes
completely after the water and they have
to they have to be fast to assist me so
engine doesn&#39;t stop so I then stay at
the controls of the ship of the wheel of
the rudder of the engine on the bridge
until we are through I put my complete
experienced mind heart and solved one
single thing how to best get her up over
that next wave and then down to the
bottom of the wave and up
time after time wave by wave for minutes
hours and sometimes actually days no
sleep no rest just that next wave sooner
or later the wind will decrease the
waves will diminish the storm will cease
and calm seas will pass my boss again
under a cloud free sky with a beach easy
rule has cover then when the Dolphins
are happily jumping at the bow in an
azure blue sea again we feel gratitude
towards a ship to each other to be alive
and to breathe and the air is so sweet
and fresh to us done and just maybe we
make a short call to our families just
say we love them so I have this life
poem that I heard many years ago and I
would like to share it with you because
it don&#39;t I think it&#39;s not only force for
seamen or people that see it was for us
all the burden of sea captains the
burden of fathers the burden of men the
burden of everyone you can&#39;t run from
the wind you trim your sails face the
music and keep on going
thank you
