an engineering student here in India
used to live in a hostel and one of the
issues he had in this was still was too
many mosquitoes Allah you can imagine a
hostel in India cabinetry now the
solution to this this gentleman used to
use the mosquito net while sleeping on
the mattress he would talk to mosquito
net under his mattress
so not a single mosquito would in turn
my turn one morning as this guy got up
he saw that he was bitten by a mosquito
extremely astonished and surprises saw
that the net was still tucked under the
mattress where did the mosquito come
from on observing he found that there
was a hole in the mosquito net
engineer as he was he had to find a
solution to this problem he didn&#39;t have
a needle didn&#39;t have a trade hidden also
he didn&#39;t want to go to anyone when you
up so he decided to find a solution he
made another hole pander to the swollen
limit and took a pipe and passed it from
one hole to the other so that the
mosquito comes in from one more and
doesn&#39;t the pipe and goes are to the
other side though engineer&#39;s offer
solution to problems doctors offer
solutions to problems
bankers offer solutions to problems
lawyers
offer solutions to problems accountants
offer solutions to problems and I as an
electrical engineer myself thought that
I would also offer solutions to problem
in the society but a different way I
decided to be a square peg in a round
hole I don&#39;t think the technology suits
too good to me I would say I decided to
be like a round peg in the square moon
especially given my hairstyle in the
square in fact there was discussing with
one of my friend and I told this friend
of mine look man look at my hairstyle
what an incredible advantage I don&#39;t
have to spend time grooming my hair but
I said to me that&#39;s an advantage but
this is a disadvantage as well you don&#39;t
know till where it to wash your face
so anyways that said I decided to
contribute to the society in a different
way by trying to help bring a social
change by spreading the Wellness of
universal spiritual principles and
teachings
I&#39;m sure the North you here are aware of
warden of super honest and all super
honest two opposite contradictory words
put in a phrase for a very compact full
meaning to give an example we would say
she is pretty ugly now dirty and ugly
are two opposite works or sometimes
people say can you give me an exact
estimate exact estimate sometimes they
say why don&#39;t you act naturally but then
that shows where opposite words are fake
or sometimes they would say this guy is
seriously funny
[Music]
my father died said he was found missing
they say he&#39;s a sincere student from I
am Roger business ethics and the fun
used to Paula Louis happily married I do
feel that business ethics is an ox
tomorrow you know why I say this because
I thought about wanting valuables
valuables at the cost of values there&#39;s
nothing wrong with valuables but when
valuables are achieved and being at the
cost of values the society faces a major
threat of a disease called corruption
NASA decided to launch their expedition
on Mars the invited applications from
across the bill and the condition of the
application was that every applicant
knew that it was a one-way expedition
having gone there the astronaut may
never come back again
go on God first an American astronaut
came a deploy the NASA chief as he was
interviewing him he asked him so you
know right if you go there you may never
come back again he said of course the
chief asked him so what is your port the
American astronauts a 1 billion dollar
said the NASA chief said a billion
dollars he said of course if I&#39;m going
there I might as well
believe knowledgable not coming back
memory they put him on the hood
the second applicant was a German
astronaut said he is alright I mean God
they&#39;ll never come back here
how much is your awkward self he said
two billion American dollars so - we
need the American astronaut scoring a
billion you&#39;ve got it two billion but
for the guy said 1 billion for my family
1 billion for social welfare and charity
came it was a corrupt Indian politician
I used to work corrupt Indian
politicians which is not necessary all
politicians McCulloch the NASA chief
said you know even an astronaut he&#39;s
nervous condition here how much in
support is that three million dollars he
said the American astronauts floating
opinion the gentleman has two knots
coating a windmill and you&#39;re not even
an astronaut in aquatic three billion
what for but I said look sir you keep 1
billion I will keep 1 billion and will
give one beer to the American astronaut
and center of mass this is the disease
when values go down the drain that we
use people sincere people the American
astronauts German has not talented
people we use people to simply be our
valuable ladies in general in the modern
world across the globe and even in this
country corruption is a bad disease and
some people are just hardwired no matter
how hard you try to teach them these
values will be key ethical model these
guys are just so absolutely hardwired
that they just won&#39;t change I would say
yes legislation governance wise there
are steps being taken
universe files laws will take the steps
social media will certain
expose them today but meanwhile I as a
spiritual activist work a lot with youth
by trying to teach them not that you
don&#39;t have your valuables but have your
valuables based on values across the
globe the youngsters and the younger
generation is becoming more
conscientious is becoming more
responsible is trying to assure them and
either which is based on ethical moral
and spiritual principles this is the
first principle that I want to share
value-based valuables which will stop
corruption will it stop may not at least
it wouldn&#39;t and further the corruption
if we are not a part of the solution at
least let us not be a part of the
problem by trying to usher in this era
and the stage of value-based valuables
every one of this world wants to have
everyone wants to how many if you want
to earn a lot of money in the dark place
I can&#39;t say much but I&#39;m sure you would
like to have a lot of money how many
people like the Lamborghini Wow and if
you would like to drive an Aston Martin
here anyone for a Ferrari there&#39;s a
loads of hands up there be sure
everyone&#39;s wants day everyone wants
money everyone wants to get and have an
achieve in a class a teacher ask the
students I would like to know what would
you want to be when you grow up so she
asked a guy called little blue can you
tell us what would you want to be when
you grow up what have you got up and
said I would like to be the richest man
on planet earth with 20 homes 700 cars
hundred servants five swiss bank
accounts and a private jet to myself
achieve man the teacher said look I
asked you to just answer them online
you&#39;ve given me an essay now when I ask
this question to everyone else I&#39;m
certain one line please so the teacher
turned to a girl in the class pooja
pooja what would you like to be when you
grow up she say
Vernon&#39;s wife madam I must tell you
everyone wants to gain and achieve
capitalism is about achieving capitalism
is about a passion to achieve half and
hope my proposal is conscious capitalism
capitalism by itself is not bad if we
make it conscious capitalism and what do
I mean by conscious capitalism
pretty simple capitalism is about a
passion to achieve conscious capitalism
is about a passion to achieve and
compassion to share
I must tell you something in the world
today and even in this country India
particularly here there are many many
genuine sincere people who need help and
thus conscious capitalism means earn and
achieve with passion and spend with
compassion I travel across the globe
speaking at large business houses
corporate events conferences conclaves
to inspire the community of conscious
capitalists every social initiative
needs funding every social initiative
needs money I as a spiritual activist
I&#39;m going and speaking at these
gatherings to create a network and the
community of such conscious capitalists
will not just limit their giving to si
si but take that extra mile to truly
benefit some social initiative that is
passion a change the form of doing say
we make a living out of what we get but
we make a life out of what we give how
many believe I would like to look
beautiful I guess those who are not
raising the hands the thing there
already
no one looks as good as their Facebook
profile pictures and no one looks as
ugly their other car or driving license
widgets no one everyone wants to look
great the world today talks about
personality and personality is reduced
to your looks your charisma your talents
your skills your abilities and the
course of pursuing a great personality
very often we forget being a good person
ladies and gentlemen I think Jesus
Christ said men must change with the
kingdom&#39;s two organizations are made of
people communities are made of people
nations are made of people the world is
made of people institutions is made of
people we cannot we cannot bring a
social change unless we can change
people only with people change
can there be a social change and you
want people to become sensitive
individuals sensitive to others
imagine sensitive human beings you know
why would there be domestic violence
when we have sensitive human beings good
persons not to stop the personality but
being a person why would they be rapes
but people have changed to be sensitive
to the needs of others why would there
be a climate change in in ecological
disasters but people have changed and
are sensitive individuals I must say one
thing when we are talking about changing
the ecology outside we first have to
change the ecology and style every issue
outside is related to an issue
internally this is why the spiritual
activists I teach
for the two practices called in Sanskrit
as sadhana some teach meditation some
teach yoga some teach prayer I had the
tradition that I represent I teach the
chanting of the holy names of God to try
clean the inner ecology in a way that an
external change can also be brought
about yes I bring an awareness amongst
people it&#39;s not just about personality
it&#39;s about being a sensitive person it&#39;s
not just about charisma it&#39;s about
character ladies and gentlemen
yes if we want to see a social change in
the world the first thing we need to be
the change ourselves and secondly we
need to join hands together and
contribute in our own ways together to
activate and bring that social change I
as a spiritual activist as a spiritual
leader try my little humble bit by doing
these three things
value-based valuables which will at
least not add further to the corruption
training the youth conscious capitalism
training the industrialists and business
houses to find initiators where earn and
achieve with passion and spend with
compassion and thirdly at the grassroot
levels as a social media and video
blogger I spread awareness through
videos I&#39;m not just having a personality
but being a sensitive person not just
having charisma but having character
ladies and gentleman I think you are
very much
[Applause]
