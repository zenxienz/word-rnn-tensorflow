connected cars
convenient or creepy frankly that&#39;s not
really the question as a privacy in
cybersecurity expert who&#39;s advised over
a third of the Fortune 100 as well as
auto manufacturers some of the largest
social media companies and other
technology companies including
artificial intelligence and machine
learning I can tell you that there&#39;s a
barrier to our realizing the full
potential and value of connected cars
and that barrier that&#39;s in the road is
not technology it&#39;s not regulatory it&#39;s
not even ethics that barrier is privacy
now certainly the connected cars they
collect information about your location
and your behavior and your preferences
as you move along the road so does your
phone and eventually so will your
refrigerator not sure that&#39;s a good
value but as we think about this in the
end that barrier I&#39;m trying to think
years ahead decades ahead and realizing
the full value and actually it will turn
out to be privacy and consumer sentiment
around technology that will actually be
the gating factor to building trusts the
trial and adoption of all of the new
services and benefits the things that
can come from connected cars in privacy
so before I accepted to make this
presentation I actually did a little bit
of research online and I went to look
around consumer sentiment and acceptance
of automotive technology and I found a
couple really interesting fun quotes one
of them was whether you like it or not
robots are increasingly replacing human
car chores inside of cars the second
quote which I found interesting to it
said that increasingly human beings are
engineered out of having a reasonable
encounter and experience within their
automotive driving experience with new
cars ok those were interesting but I got
a confession to make those actually
aren&#39;t about connected cars those are
actually from 1958 58 years ago and
comments about the original Chrysler
launch of the first autopilot the
feature that we now call cruise control
so consumer sentiment around automotive
technology it&#39;s an emotional experience
and that was you see as we go through
these things actually turns out to be
that will make the difference now when
we talk about connected cars of today
there&#39;s a perfect technological storm
increasingly high-speed processing power
low cost of that plus the advent of
machine learning artificial intelligence
Internet of Things Internet of Things is
the part that&#39;s really interesting in
that it takes and embeds sensors and
controllers in everyday products that
now enables companies to receive
information and to monitor your
engagement or interaction and in turn
develop new services and new revenue and
do business models around that product
so it&#39;s no surprise that automotive
interest in this area given that it&#39;s
one of the most expensive and most
influential and Tom occupying product
that you have interacting in your daily
life is the subject of all this
discussion so when we think about what&#39;s
going to happen short there&#39;s a lot of
discussion of the long term impact it&#39;s
going to be disruptive and
transformative to the automotive
industry but it&#39;s also going to impact
transportation logistics insurance and
interestingly enough television media
and advertising I mean what are you
going to do with all that time in your
car when you&#39;re during your commute time
when you&#39;re actually not driving no no
actually Madison Avenue wants to know
what are you going to do in your car
when you&#39;re actually not driving so your
car will increasingly over time become a
platform for technology new services how
you spend your time entertainment
advertising so if you think decades out
the experience is completely different
than what we have now and that consumer
sentiment how quickly we adopt those
things will make a difference now what&#39;s
at stake if we do it well we&#39;ll have
customized automotive experiences
autonomous
driving increased safety and all these
other new benefits if done poorly it&#39;s
more than just a significant impact to
the automotive industry and launching
these services and new revenue models it
actually potentially can retard the
trial and adoption of new technologies
that are based in machine learning
artificial intelligence and Internet of
Things going forward so there&#39;s a lot at
stake here so what&#39;s the solution so
before we can discuss the solution we
have to talk about what the heart of the
problem is so we can architect the
solution and the way I look at in
privacy today&#39;s consent model where
individuals and I think it&#39;s an
important thing that they have control
all of their use and sharing of their
information but we do it on a one by one
by one interaction I opt into this
interaction for the Internet online I
opt-in for this hotel chain to contact
me one by one but in the world where
artificial intelligence and machine
learning gonna present millions of
decisions as we drive from the house to
the office to the children&#39;s school to
our vacation the one by one consent
model will collapse and fail and we
won&#39;t be able to realize the full value
and benefit of connected cars and
autonomous driving so the solution that
I&#39;m presenting today is something that&#39;s
called affiliated consent in an
affiliated consent individuals choose to
give up their individual one by one
decision-making and actually entrust a
trusted third party to be able to create
curated experiences for them as they
travel the road their own digital mobile
personal concierge for limited specific
purposes so who are we gonna trust to
make these decisions who are we gonna
trust to be able to do that well is it
gonna be for me my auto manufacturer is
mercedes-benz gonna be able to make
decisions about what we know where Jim
goes we know how he drives how long
it&#39;ll take how much time we&#39;ll have it
is destination and
and be able to plan things maybe but
maybe because I travel a lot and just
stay at Hilton hotels and I consider
that&#39;s the type of brand and a height of
brand that I like and maybe Hilton&#39;s
gonna get into the game and say hey
besides just booking hotel rooms I could
create total travel adventures so now I
know that you&#39;re going on business or
for pleasure to a city and I&#39;m gonna
book the entire trip we&#39;re gonna hotel
reservations and sightseeing and we&#39;re
gonna have actually have your car be the
tour guide on things that you&#39;re
interested in as you move through and
navigate through the city now and
they&#39;re also gonna do it and schedule
things starting after 11 o&#39;clock because
they know when I travel personally I set
late wake-up calls right bring you all
the information together but maybe
they&#39;re not the right one maybe it&#39;s
triple-a triple-a has over a hundred
years of data and understanding of what
people like when they travel the roads
and where they go and they also can
protect drivers they have insurance and
other things that really make a strong
wonderful interactive experience maybe
but you know what maybe at the end of
the day we look at our credit card
companies because they know our behavior
they know how we spend money and maybe I
may call myself Neiman Marcus and Saks
Fifth Avenue but when you actually look
at my spending behavior I&#39;m actually
tarjay I actually love a good discount
and I love a good benefit so they&#39;re
gonna be looking for discounts and
things to offer me as I move through the
city and work through it now I don&#39;t
know what the future is gonna look like
20-30 years from now but I can tell you
two things that I know about it first
the automobile is going to be much less
about on a motive experience it&#39;s
actually a platform for electronics and
interactive and they services the
experience and things that we&#39;re gonna
do the second thing that I can tell you
about the experience is that we can&#39;t
predict what those new services and uses
are we think there&#39;s great things now a
lane correction how far that is off from
the the 1959 model auto pilot from
Chrysler it&#39;s not that much different
but who knows what&#39;s gonna happen in the
next 10 20 years let me give you an
example we haven&#39;t even touch with the
we haven&#39;t even touched the tip of the
iceberg let me give an example of motion
pictures okay Thomas Edison a number of
other inventors
collaborated invented the motion picture
camera in 1891 19 years later 19 years
later where they said oh we can move the
camera we&#39;re so used to theater and
people coming in from stage right stage
left we kept the camera still 19 years
later they had the first action shot
took them 19 years to move the camera
but that&#39;s the that&#39;s not ironic it&#39;s
actually it was almost 30 years from the
invention of the camera before they had
the first soom right she&#39;s coming in and
show a motion or or something that&#39;s
really wonderful today&#39;s cinematography
right now it wasn&#39;t that it took almost
30 years to do it the zoom technology
existed almost nine years earlier WG
Griffith used it in a short film and the
comments from the press were were this
New Moon technology we didn&#39;t pay for
the heads and shoulders of the actors we
paid for the full body so we cling to
things were used to we cling to things
that were like and I still want
consumers to have full control right
privacy and cybersecurity expert I&#39;m not
necessarily about selling information
I&#39;m not necessarily about uh but I want
to realize the full benefit of these
things of the technology and uses that
we can so I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not
necessarily gonna be my generation but
when I look to the Millennials I think
to myself well I think a lot of things
but actually what I do think is that
there&#39;s several first they&#39;re the
sharing generation they share automotive
experiences they share apartments they
share bicycles and they also are much
more adept at using technology and maybe
they&#39;ll share information for value but
also for good causes to reduce pollution
get better use out of our cars and our
natural resources and all I know is that
that&#39;s the type of balance that&#39;s really
important in balancing personal privacy
and choices and decision and being able
to realize the full value and benefit of
connected cars but trust is important
without trust
whole model fails and collapses but
right now with a one to one decision
making the road isn&#39;t clear using
affiliated consent and trusted third
party could be the first bridge on that
road maybe not the long term solution
but the first one that&#39;ll allow us to
start experiencing what that technology
could do and actually give us a full
clear road to accelerate where we&#39;re
gonna go
who knew that privacy as opposed to a
barrier could actually be a competitive
advantage and the accelerator on the
road to realizing the full benefit and
value of not just connected cars but the
next generation of machine learning
artificial intelligence and enter of
things design products
