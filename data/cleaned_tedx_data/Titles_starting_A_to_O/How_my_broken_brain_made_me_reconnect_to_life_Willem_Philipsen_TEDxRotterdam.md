Thanks
so let&#39;s do this like a concert and put
your hands in the air like you just
don&#39;t care
come on people do it that&#39;s beautiful
yeah so I wish I could join you guys but
as you can see my right arm is like yeah
dude let&#39;s party but my left is like
maybe Netflix and chill and I actually
mean watching Netflix and chill you know
so as you could see in the video I used
to be a professional guitar player I
started playing the instrument when I
was 11 and when I was 23 I was proud to
be working with several well-known Dutch
artists among which our postman
salvation and Anouk and I was living the
dream making music
following my passion and my life
couldn&#39;t get any better sex drugs and
rock roll yeah you know what I&#39;m talking
about until May 10 2007 when I came home
from a concert I went to bed and I was
woken up by the fiercest headache you
can ever imagine and I don&#39;t mean fierce
like Beyonce no it was literally like
somebody was hitting me in the face with
a sledgehammer which is not a good look
for me and I thought it must be stress
and a handful of advil and the good
night&#39;s rest wood did the trick
but within 30 seconds the whole left
side of my body was paralyzed and it
couldn&#39;t even get up anymore so my
girlfriend called 9-1-1
and i was rushed to the hospital where
it became clear that i had suffered a
massive stroke on the right side of my
head of my brain and they had to operate
on me to prevent me from dying which is
a thing not dying
so what they did is they removed a piece
of my skull and to alleviate the
pressure my brain was under and later
they reattached it to my head which was
formerly perfectly symmetrical but now
I&#39;m still I still have a dent which is
not that beautiful but whatever I woke
up a week later to a broken body and a
broken brain and the doctors told me I
would probably have to spend my days in
a wheelchair my life would never be the
same again
never again would I be on stage for
doing the thing that I love most never
again would have experienced the joy of
performing live then after a month in
the hospital they try to make me go to
rehab and I said yeah yeah yeah
thank you
[Music]
and that&#39;s when I had to learn
everything you normally take for granted
all over again
stuff like washing yourself getting
dressed which today worked out just fine
but you should have seen me then
horrible you name it I had to relearn it
even speaking was kind of tough and then
after six months working hard on my
recovery I they let me go and that&#39;s
when you just have to find your way on
your own which is easier said than done
because when I came home I felt kind of
lost and I didn&#39;t know what to do with
myself I didn&#39;t have any purpose felt
useless and that&#39;s when I realized I
wanted to pick up a sport to get my mind
off things and mainly honestly not
become a total fat bastard so I decided
to go with swimming which because you
know running is no longer an option it
would probably take me three days to
finish a marathon and so I joined a club
for handi-capable like me and I started
training but at one point I wanted to
swim a bit more fanatic and my eye was
caught by an invitation to an open water
swimming event called go engine or the
island which is an island in the river
Maas which runs through our beautiful
city and it&#39;s a 3k open water swim
people thought I was crazy
they were like did you have a stroke or
something
but the thought of me being able to
challenge myself to a 3k open swim with
only using one arm and one leg really
got me excited it made me feel alive
again
so me and my buddy Arno we trained for
one and a half years and eventually
finished the swim yeah thank you
[Music]
the clock is still ticking by the way
but thank you and our participation was
greatly appreciated by all the swimmers
you can see they all just doback right
into the water and this actually this
was fulfilling for me it gave me a sense
of purpose again you know just getting
back into life actually reinventing
myself in sports and even my function of
walking got better by movement and
sports because you know sports and
movement stimulates the making of new
connections to the brain but I also
realized that I could make difference in
how people with disabilities are
perceived so by now you must be
wondering what happened to the music
because I&#39;m a musician first and the
swimmer second well I needed to find a
way of making music again without the
use of the guitar which was kind of hard
because I put my 10,000 hours in unitive
master it but I turned to composing and
producing on the computer and this took
a lot of getting used to but by now I
have a long company with which I make
music for all kinds of media and
recently I started booking live music
for two venues which is a great feeling
because I get to offer the states to a
new generation of artists it&#39;s really
cool you guys are really you want to
clap right it&#39;s cool
four minutes to go but even when you
remember how I started this talk by
saying I had a stroke on the right side
of my brain well
incidentally the right side is
considered to be the more musical side
of the brain and the left side is more
responsible for language which is not a
good thing if you&#39;re a musician
but still I compose and produce daily I
listen to music 24/7 in essence I am
music and I wanted to make sense of how
this would work because you know seeing
that this half of the brain is for the
musical stuff sorry
wouldn&#39;t it seem impossible to get back
into music somehow right so I wanted to
make sense of this all and I went into
an MRI scanner and this is what my brain
looks like lent like now so you can see
the right side is almost totally gone
which is pretty gruesome and it made me
this picture always makes me think of
Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd
during the scan I listened to music so
what you see here is the activity that&#39;s
going on in my brain when I&#39;m
experiencing music so we carefully
assume that left had taken over the
musical functions of the right which is
really cool so my brain was essentially
reinventing itself in order for me to
make music again
but thinking back of my life as a guitar
player sorry I&#39;m funk this up so
actually my brain was reinventing itself
and you know I&#39;ve always felt that there
must be more to it than just a head full
of air until recently I have the chance
to make a so-called brain feat which is
a selfie of the brain on what they do is
they make a scan of your brain activity
based on electromagnetic energy so what
we found was this this is like the left
side of my brain as you can see red is
activity and blue is inactivity this
looks rather normal
so what would you guys expect show of
hands what kind of activity will we see
on the on the right side where there is
no physical brain matter would you
expect activity raise your hands you
would or no activity remember there is
no physical brain matter and this is
what we saw so it&#39;s totally red which is
amazing it&#39;s shocking to see that
there&#39;s no physical matter and there&#39;s
still so much activity going on well
thinking back of my life as a guitar
player I was maybe I didn&#39;t have
physical impairments as I have now but
maybe just maybe how the way I was
living was kind of superficial right
you know when movement isn&#39;t that
self-evident anymore and life forces you
something you don&#39;t seem to have a
choice in I believe that you always have
some sort of choice as Chinese
philosopher loud Tsai once said when
there&#39;s a stone in your shoe you can
totally become that stone it&#39;s all about
focus
do you choose to become the stone or do
you keep your sights on the horizon it&#39;s
all about making choices we make on a
daily basis you know what my disability
has learned me is that you can still
choose and in fact you make these
choices every day do you choose to let
limits define what is possible or do you
choose to explore new paths essentially
reinventing yourself in the end you guys
are the only one that can choose for
themselves and as for me I&#39;ve got half a
body and half a brain but more than ever
I&#39;m a complete person living the dream
thank you
you
