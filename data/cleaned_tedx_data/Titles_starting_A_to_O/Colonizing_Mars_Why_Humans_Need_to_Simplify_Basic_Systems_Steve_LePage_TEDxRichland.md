and welcome to the 25th year celebration
on Mars tour I hope you all had a good
fun cruise out and I know we gave you a
chance to step outside and experience
firsthand our extreme atmosphere but now
that you&#39;re back inside the dome and the
tunnels we have plenty of activities for
you I think it&#39;ll have fun and
experience our controlled atmosphere
here and I think the first things you&#39;re
going to notice over the next couple of
weeks are our basic systems have been
rationalized and I think it&#39;s kind of
intuitive you&#39;ll catch on to it pretty
fast in fact I think once you go back
home to earth that day you&#39;re gonna have
kind of a friction there are adjusting
back to the old archaic ways because
life here is so simple and intuitive
even our work days are organized and
everything seems to come right at hand
so you&#39;ll experience that firsthand you
might say oh well you colonized a new
plan of course you have to have new
systems everything has to be new but
that wasn&#39;t really the case actually it
more out of a tragedy
we had a mid-air collision over a
mystery Mounds dome and this is what led
to our standardization this is the
future history story of the
standardization of systems on Mars so in
the winter of 2048 we had a scheduled
American passenger plane coming in to
mr. mounds and there was also a
scheduled Russian cargo plane that was
on a intercept course and you&#39;d say how
does that happen with all the air
traffic control and everything but there
was an impact and in the collision there
was a mixing of the cargo with we had
sodium there was as a casket of metal
and there was containerized chlorine gas
those compressed and there was a huge
explosion from that that actually rained
down on mr.
and broke the dome so he had all
fatalities in there and then there was
many people died on the surface the
Confederation of Mars got together and
they said this can never happen again
we must find out get down to the root of
this problem and solve this in our basic
systems so they formed of course their
safety board investigate this for a
couple months and they came up with five
mistakes that were made that day that
any one of them possibly might have
averted this crash they passed this
information out to all the colonies and
they&#39;ve consulted their independent
scientists and they got committees
together and they came up with proposals
and they all reassembled as the sub
Directorate to investigate this crash
and come up with solutions first up was
the Brazilian delegate and he said that
we we see the crash and we&#39;ve studied
the problem the first mistake identified
was that the Russian copilot
had typed in their destination
coordinates and mistakenly got an e
instead of a W so they were headed for
mistery mounds but they got dislocated
over here to kamek crater and the
central computer did not pick this up
put them on a collision course so we&#39;ve
all had trouble with the alphanumeric
Cartesian coordinate system and we want
to simplify this here&#39;s our proposal
we&#39;ll go to straight numerals and
there&#39;s nine digits that we can have for
a latitude it would work like this
instead of 360 degrees in a circle let&#39;s
expand that out to a thousand Jenks and
if we go down the International Dateline
through the center of Ariel crater which
is the locator clear to the South Pole
then that would delineate 500 different
latitudes and then we come back up to
the equator
and we go counterclockwise to the east
all the way around and that&#39;s a thousand
jinx and that would be all of the
longitudes for Mars and with this simple
system we could have nine digits for a
latitude and nine digits for longitude
and plug those into our GPS and we could
deliver a package anywhere on Mars
within a meter of your front door so
this is a complete simplification and we
move that this be adopted by the
committee the sub Directorate thought
about that and they voted on it and they
accepted that so that was one step
forward after that the Iranian delegate
got up and he said that we have a
problem with the time that the American
plane had an identified problem it had a
an earth auto pilot still and we all
know that there&#39;s 24.7 hours in a
Martian day and 687 days in a Martian
year
well when the pilot had plugged in the
destination time on mystery Mars mystery
mounds pray that the autopilot sped the
plane up to get there at the earth our
designation and this was identified as a
significant problem so our solution ties
in some up with the Brazilians we want
to go to a fully numeric compounder
clock system combined so in counting
numbers the kids using things you start
with the day one year one century one
and that&#39;s simple but it&#39;s not really
math it&#39;s not true math that you would
use to make calculations so we want to
go to whole numbers and that&#39;s where you
start on day zero or you can think of it
as days zero complete plus and by doing
that we would translate say today&#39;s time
back on earth in Seattle might be

March 27th 2048 year at 10:31 a.m.
Pacific Standard Time
well let&#39;s simplify that and bring that
down in our new whole number system of a
calendar clock we would say that that

would be 20 47 : 0 8 5 days point 4 to 8
6 partial days and that would be Pacific
time in that time zone but we&#39;d do away
with the daylight savings time that&#39;s
ridiculous
so this actually syncs up perfectly with
the Brazilians motion you see if they
have the coordinates in 1,000
the 2 time zone and it happened to be 2
partial days on the clock well you know
intuitively that over here at the 4 time
zone it&#39;s four partial days and so the
two worked together and so we propose
that this being adopted by the committee
and subdirectory thought about that and
it seemed like harmless proposal so they
adopted that one to deal with the second
problem and then we go to the third
problem the French delegate got up and
he said that we had a problem identified
with the American plane had I had loaded
up six containers in the back of the
plane and they were clearly manifested
as one metric ton weight each well they
had logged it in to their calculations
as one standard English tongue and
that&#39;s the versus 1 kilogram 1000
kilograms at 20 205 pounds each versus a
standard 2,000 pounds for the English
tongue and what this did was put the
America plane slightly overweight and it
may have affected their
flight controls once the two planes
realized they were going to impact they
may not have been able to avoid the
collision so we simply must standardize
these weight measurements we identified
we&#39;ve built the metric system on base
ten and it&#39;s very scalable up and down
it&#39;s easy to learn it&#39;s intuitive and we
can&#39;t have two conflicting weight
standards out there so we move that the
whole Mars go to one metric system and
there was little having high and of
course the Americans you have to drag
them into it so they they finally agreed
okay we can we can go that far and that
one was adopted by the board so going
forward the Russian delegate stood up
and he said there was a further problem
with the transcription on our coordinate
destination the air traffic controller
actually called back the co-pilot and
said now are you going to comic crater
and he said in clear English that we are
going there too meaning first we&#39;re
going to unload at history mounds and
then our second destination is comic
crater well the air traffic control
computer picked this up as they were

going to comic crater at 2:00 p.m. and
it said this is a common problem in
English there are many homonyms and
similar words you have a large expansive
vocabulary and for that reason we
propose that we go to Russian as the
official language of air traffic control
well boy they&#39;re caused a firestorm
there the American delegate jumped up
and he said now wait a second air
traffic control has always been in
English as the official language and
there&#39;s a reason for that
it&#39;s very concise and it conveys a lot
of information in a short amount
time and so we would resist this and the
Russian delegate said yes yes we assume
that so I have developed a test
paragraph here and we have the receding
is being recorded here by the AI
recorder computer let&#39;s see how it does
on this test paragraph and let me read
this off for you here he goes if there
are five or fewer misspellings then we
would agree to leave the official flight
control language as English did you read
the gym wipe the dew off of John&#39;s
clarinet and gave him to read reads I
too had read that it was on his to-do
list because he had borrowed it and was
due to play it well you can guess the
reaction there from the transcription it
came out eleven either misspelled or
completely missing words and the
American delegate kind of shrunk he goes
oh my god what&#39;d I do
he said this is hard to come back from
but the assistant delegate jumped up and
she said wait a second let me have a go
at this
I&#39;m originally from the Pacific
Northwest on earth and we have precise
diction she had a go at it
spoke slowly and clearly and luckily the
computer had adaptive learning and was
able to pick out more of the words
meanings out of the context of the
sentence so the second time it came out
with four misspellings and luckily from
that it still said in some circles that
she saved the English language on the
space frontier so the Greek delegate got
up and he says we have a system we&#39;ve
been working on that every exact word
sound should have one exact phonetic
spelling and there are some homonyms
so we
identify those at the end but the root
of the word should all be spelled the
same so when you see this you know
exactly how to pronounce it there we go
so the first rule we have is for short
vowels they be the short sound you would
type at once the long vowel sound you
would just double type it and so a a ii
III oh oh you you so that makes it very
simple with the first rule the second
would be that say you had a word and
there was the first prime definition
that everyone uses we would just use the
precise phonetic spelling there then the
second most commonly used definition of
that same sound word we would append a
silent theta letter to the end and
instead of that on the third most
commonly definition we would append a
Phi Greek letter that&#39;s silent on the
end so this would identify that the
spelling is correct in the middle but
this is the second or third definition
okay so this is what it would look like
we call this derivative spelling of
English Spacey and it takes up a little
more room but you know exactly how to
pronounce every word and we think that
the computer would be able to pick up
the context of this a little easier and
that was considered so the board went
through this there was some
back-and-forth negotiation and they
finally adopted this proposal then the
Namibian delegate got up and he said you
know even before this terrible tragedy
we have been working on keyboards we
have many students to educate and we
want something simpler than the old
QWERTY keyboard so this can tie in with
the Greeks proposal what we&#39;ve done is
put the vowels in the middle row in the
middle and we put the consonants in
alphabetical order on the top and the
bottom lines
what this does is it allows syllable
sets when you type up and down the
keyboard so it goes that that did that
that did that
they&#39;re very fast motion our students
have been able to pick this up 15%
faster than the old QWERTY keyboard and
they can type it once they learn it
about 10% faster the computers are fully
programmable as to location the keys
that&#39;s no problem and this is our
solution you see that they tacked in the
theta and Phi symbols on the right side
there well that seemed like a simple fix
and as they said the computers are
programmable so they voted in favor of
that motion going forward then the
Chinese delegate finally got up and he
said the fifth problem identified with
this crash was that the crew did not
know the explosive properties of these
commodities and the handlers they&#39;re not
trained in this
there were hazardous stickers on the
casks on the containers but they didn&#39;t
know what it would react with so what we
propose is that they be stamped also
with this relational wheel of elements
so that they get a sense of what
elements might react with what this is
pretty straightforward the center column
in the bottom there is the noble gases
and they&#39;re very stable and that&#39;s the
reason because they have a complete
shell of electrons in their outer shell
so they feel comfortable they&#39;re compact
and they don&#39;t react much with the other
elements if we go down the third column
third row down on the center column
there of noble gases you&#39;ll see argon
argon juice and welding and things
because it&#39;s so inert it displaces the
oxygen and it&#39;s common gas well to the
left of that you&#39;ll see sodium now
sodium has character
of having one loose electron in the
outer shell and it&#39;s very loosely
attached it&#39;s a quick bind with other
elements on the right of the center
column you&#39;ll see chlorine and that one
needs one electron in the outer shell to
feel satisfied and feel complete it both
like to be like argon so you can see the
reaction here that when they touch and
there&#39;s little humidity in the air they
immediately collapse into a more stable
compact molecule sharing the one
electron and this releases a lot of heat
and energy and a big explosion so that
forms sodium chloride or common table
salt if they had seen this they might
have identified the problem and
separated those two pieces of cargo that
concluded all of the new standards and
we have seen the economists have studied
this since it was implemented there has
actually been a point one percentage
point increase in the net GDP annually
from these easier standards that make
work so much more productive but more
importantly since the implementation
there had been no mid-air collisions I
swear thank you
you
