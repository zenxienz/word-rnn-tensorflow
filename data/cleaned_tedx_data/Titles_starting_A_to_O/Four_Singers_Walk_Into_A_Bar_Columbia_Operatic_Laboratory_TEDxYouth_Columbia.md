for sinners walking to Allah only three
walk out you know as we are about to see
I&#39;m not one of the singers my name is
rusty socks and I will be here to serve
as your narrator and translator for
today&#39;s performance and what you&#39;re
about to hear much of the visit of
foreign language so I will be here to
explain everything that they are about
to sing about but before we go any
further I want to introduce a very
special person and that is our
accompanist for this afternoon miss
Stephanie bova Stephanie give us a wave
[Applause]
without Stephanie there would be no show
so thank you for being with us today
Stephanie bova and now for singers who
here has ever sung in a choir or in
chorus yes anyone anyone who can tell me
what the four major voice parts are in a
choir just shout them out soprano alto
tenor bass you guys are fantastic well
in the world of opera you can&#39;t have
just plain soprano alto tenor x&#39; and
basses operatic singers have to add a
few doodads to their voice
classifications for example tonight we
have our soprano and that is Maria berry
by the way Thank You Maria and our alto
or rather I should say our mezzo soprano
an opera we call them mezzo Sopranos an
Italian that actually means half a
soprano tonight our mezzo soprano is
Jennifer Mitchell right right there are
always too many Sopranos and not enough
mezzos so tonight we&#39;re using another
soprano
sorry about that you&#39;ll just get have to
get used to playing second fiddle for
the afternoon and now for our tenner
oh wait I was supposed to introduce you
first right well in case you don&#39;t know
tenors are known to have something of a
large ego it&#39;s to make up for what they
may lack in other areas ladies and
gentlemen here he is in his own mind the
star of today&#39;s performance mr. Michael
T Brown thank you very much I&#39;d like to
take this opportunity to say if you were
nope wait we have yet to introduce the
bass he&#39;s not that important we only
hired him come on this the sooner we
introduce him the sooner we get to your
solo eh
all right so our bass for today mr.
Andrew Mitchell thank you I&#39;m actually a
lyric baritone actually no one cares so
we&#39;re just gonna move along and now on
with our show opera singers they&#39;re just
like everybody else
only they sing about everything they do
so since we&#39;re set in a bar today what
do people normally do in bars anyway
right they drink and they try to hook up
and here&#39;s here&#39;s a typical scenario two
men fighting over the same woman
[Music]
hey babe did it hurt when you fell from

heaven Sonia :
[Music]
[Music]
hey girl what do you say let&#39;s get out
of here I don&#39;t know what about him

[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
well you can see who won that argument
okay so now let&#39;s hear what Sopranos
typically do they gossip and they try to
out sing each other while pretending to
be friends he&#39;s built like a warrior and
a lover
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
he&#39;s eye candy and dangerous I&#39;m so in
love if we ever broke up OMG
oMFG if we broke up I just died
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh well after his failed attempt to woo
the met so it looks like our tenor has
been building himself up with some
liquid courage what you got there
that&#39;s it with lemon slow down maybe
you&#39;ve had a little too much hey come
over here I&#39;ve got an idea
[Music]
he know the mornin center she still
doesn&#39;t love me he&#39;s pretending
indifference he Nora Morton on sente she
still doesn&#39;t love me he no more notes
pretend I said something funny
[Applause]
my mom
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
he&#39;s trying to play it cool and flirt
with someone else he&#39;s gonna regret it
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
so you come here often oh no never been
here in my life really cuz I would have
sworn I met you before me no I&#39;m just a
sheltered girl who his father never lets
her go anywhere except to church on
Sunday then only with my nanny but there
I met a poor student and we fell in love
father would never approve and what did
you say your name was um Jill de ha
you&#39;re just reciting the plot to the
rape of the Opera Rigoletto oh darn it I
was sure he wouldn&#39;t recognize that one
who are you really hold on time out time
out we baritones are normally pretty
chilled but this is clearly a guy I mean
look at this ridiculous wig that he has
on am I really supposed to fall for this
I suppose what does any one of you going
to believe that I&#39;m going to get with
this Jennifer wait be reasonable
Oh morning hey wait what is this I&#39;m
changing fuck I&#39;m becoming the tenor
[Music]
okay okay okay hold it we don&#39;t have
time for an extended death scene here
they only gave us 18 minutes to do this
whole thing just go ahead and die okay
[Laughter]
well this is a little morbid this is
supposed to be a comedy right shouldn&#39;t
we end things on a high note not too
high okay I&#39;m not sure our ears can take
it
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
