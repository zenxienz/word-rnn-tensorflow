so he will be high and he was fine he
have to be said so I said can I speak to
you in a minute
I said yes why not he said you are
splendid I said thank you very much
easier to be a mistake
hush this fatso he said and
he said you know I&#39;m a professor like 40
years I&#39;ve been fighting in that water
history book and I can tell you from
random Winston Churchill never ever met
Hitler in his lifetime she said great
you see yes it is correct I said but I
read it somewhere
he&#39;s already doing it I said I read the
numpad I was what he said it was a boxer
but he&#39;s a mystery and chalky and all
the sorts of the politics in my math
come back to something like 25 years ago
this gentleman notice blood when power
was walking down the street and on the
other side of the road was this man was
taking power in his hand he was begging
that&#39;s what you should do as ask any
other side of the road of the back of it
okay you see this man and he&#39;s he&#39;s
Batman and he for nothing about a
powerful you see that girl right but for
the person who opened her yes yet of
stoppable nature
he stood really he is to thinking about
the richest and abundant perhaps a blue
we won with and without the hair has had
at all he&#39;s been there and done that and
never I would never be my son it&#39;s
useless
this is the first reason if you cannot
know the person without knowing his
history from authentic sources how do
you think you know a country animation
of this proportion we talk about the
side world we talk about he Jobs Bill
Gates
in Dundee photographers Barack Obama won
all sorts of inspired by them no I&#39;m
motivated there are other wonderful it&#39;s
my being silent but my problem is the
greatest dream in the history of the
world have invaded our backyards
brightest of backups it started 1947 and
we never hear too far I never ever do
you know in 1947 that you become Pro
I&#39;ll give you some examples 1950 we
passed Ellison&#39;s arrived 1952 a time for
the British was getting us we they start
to be getting us some tax in 1764 Battle
of Buxar
and it ended nineteen forty seven
hundred eighty years something like that
there are close to 23 is the - which
struck any 33 points first what happened
in 1764 and the last one in 1940 this is
not important what does in what was a
proportion of her things that happen the
last of my it happened in 1943 and in
that one for my loss to put these six
lakh people lost their lives proposal
what was the population will be at that
136 groves 1950 what does it mean one
person of every hundred person not this
is what goes down to us when we worship
to get it for under 80 years this is
what was done
imagine the gathering here how many
people are here one out of 100 type it
about that one single mine remains here
illiteracy 82% people in 1950 were
illiterate they were not able to read
and write 80 to 100 people
hunga hunga babysitter poverty what is
poverty definition I&#39;m using is people
working about men or people who are not
able
get the food by the poop which can
nourish them for the next day 53 percent
of Indians in 1950 were under poverty
line
what does it mean 53 percent the total
population studies sixth row 50% comes
out from nineteen throws the population
of America that point in time of
nineteen throws we had a chief or humpy
hungry starts at that parental
population of neither kingdom five
curves
France six throws cheering he throws and
we had 18 for hungry people here to feed
1947 50 that&#39;s what we started them
that&#39;s the past I&#39;m talking Bob
now what with enough 1947 we started the
first fight why that is hunger because
that&#39;s what you do
you had to arrange the food first and
one of my church was what a fight
we started out walking in terms of fun
and mama
yeah if my pipes are right he had close
to AA 30,000 tractors in India 1950 and
I&#39;m not just throwing the figures go
ahead and read any event ago 30,000
practice in India 1930 they rose to flow
through one leg 55 5 x 19 1975 I&#39;m just
giving you an impression of what was the
response of people we had close to 1
lakh
sure wells in 1955 life by 1935 they all
try close to true lack of diesel pumps
which promised use super 59 / 1935 he
will fight it but times were bad it was
before the jollibee had to take for long
by the end of 1967 there came a time
when our primary service was God he had
to pick up the phone and call the
pressure of that States of America
Lyndon Johnson so I once approved in for
my country people are dying out here
what was the age 1967 20 years there&#39;s
still fight over in Java then happened
the Green Revolution and then happened
over high-yielding varieties to see
eaten and so on and so forth and it was
by 1980s that we made the fast 10 by 19
we were last time in a position to lead
our country fully in terms of movements
and then it was another thing nominated
by it but not only able to produce
things which was so vision for our
country we had a stock of around 20
billion tons 1985 who plays and that was
the first one extry we had that was a
prospect to the end and there might
still be some naysayers out here but let
me tell you Mike at the same period the
population grew by two point one percent
and the full grain production view by
three percent that was rather mean
tossed or a punchy with that past but
had this been the story I would not be
here this was only a pair of it came for
a structure and that&#39;s where the beauty
comes in I&#39;m gonna throw in some facts
and statistics to you they were pros to
fool that convenience of crosswalks week
7 day in and day out today what my
commenters are brought in 1952 love you
2014 that care available now what does
it mean subtract the two figures divided
by 365 into 50 that comes up two hundred
numbers of roads we made each day two
hundred dollars of growth will be made
each day of 50 long years you fight the
battle with the hunger and making roads
monochrome does each day rain Rose
fifty-three thousand kilometres nineteen
fifty sixty three thousand by two
thousand half a meter of rail of been
made each day for 50 years civilization
we had close to nothing in terms of
civilization now again since his things
happened and the most interesting thing
can he jump saw power the installed
capacity effect our India in 1950 was to
thousands we had at Panama&#39;s and if I&#39;m
not wrong then ten years ago in Debbie
maximum capacity the public utilize
exams of install capacity was for
problems within nine months but
interesting thing is this when we
brought independence then in 1953 as off
of that get for 3000 villages which were
electrified in 2000 close to five 928
villagers being electrified each day now
imagine if fighting a war
we&#39;re making 20 kilometers of roads we
may be 0.5 meters of railroads taking

ecstasy 28:28 village is interesting but
we didn&#39;t stop him
this would have been the story I would
have come from this Baba the magic was
still to go that came in terms of
education 1945 something I&#39;ve been
discussing with somebody the first ayat
II was built 1945 and the next 10 years
they have our old white board you know
anybody in education sector will realize
this that it&#39;s not easy to construct the
national importance education center why
how to get the faculty today you have
whatsapp you have forms you have image
you can write an Oscar for the CDs just
imagine how would they have done it 50
years ago creating these institutions of
national excellence didn&#39;t stop that was
not fame I&#39;m talking about because they
have a people different leaders they
were common man or cleaning pick up is a
dreaming much bigger they were talking
and thinking and dreaming of capturing
the nucleus on one hand and signing in
the space overhead and they get it 1952
Department of Energy was established
only Tommy power he was a boy about 1954
we had the first UVA power center and
drop them then the 1960s we had the
first rocket launching facility were not
satisfied with Leicester so by 1962 we
launched our first something rocket the
factory which is fighting with hunger
it&#39;s constructing railroads in the road
is now launching rockets very next year
it launched the first with me teaching
these people profit magnets and then in
1974 we have a first nuclear bomb
explosion we have tamed the view fron
we&#39;ve enough stopping in 1975 we sent
our our efforts to the space
ha be pretty history five years fighting
the better with humble making yours in
rigor odds
I don&#39;t whatnot and then we are captain
the new president will come to the space
all the while this was happening what
was happening to our neighbors
the first ingo 1947 it was not an easy
job people making all these bed off at
the same time you were praying there in
1927 indo-pak war number 1 1962
Indochina war 1967 in the pop shops
headed war and then came 1971 the golden
moment where we brought a battle and
created a country for $1 and in the
meanwhile amazing things like people
even incorporated other than a few insa
it was we were incorporating a hetero ma
to hug her and he would sink in the 1971
Sally
so ladies and gentlemen what I want to
say here is this is a beautiful country
and it has a profound a very deep and
rich history and somebody said this we
make span wise it makes boy it&#39;s witty
it makes the Keynesian subtle it makes
perform philosophies keep an oral spray
or the people who forget their history
are the people who do not remember the
history are the people who do not have a
past but more importantly they are the
people who will not have a future I
request you and I approach you not to
forget you keep track of your history
from original resources read your books
apply upon mind and brain and
interpretations to that your own
understanding and develop your own
impression about the issues and show
that to this job and one day you will
stand erect and look with love affection
inspiration motivation all right I&#39;ll
shake it in respect and away in the eyes
of your mother&#39;s mother&#39;s they are
mothers and their fathers their brand
wasn&#39;t big and fathers and POW and
better for them and say that this is the
breeze that I cannot thank you very much
[Applause]
