what&#39;s your favorite song well guess
what if you ever ask me to play any of
these songs
I must almost probably just ignore you
at least not before you and I have this
talk I&#39;m a DJ and unlike what you might
think I did not become a DJ by shuffling
through my iPod
nor did I type 50 best sets of the year
and press the first link I found I&#39;m a
DJ and unlike what you might expect I do
not have to play all your favorite songs
see a DJ is a professional I learned how
to DJ when I was 16 I was mentored by
professional I learned how to use the
set and experimented with every single
button with that set just to become
familiar with what works and what
doesn&#39;t it was hard work really really
hard work I explored every single genre
of music and I have made sure that I&#39;m
up-to-date with all the latest sets and
the trendiest techniques what people do
not know is that being a DJ demands a
lot of creativity it requires being
original even with the most common
classical and the most popular songs
from Peggy Lee&#39;s fever to the Eagles
Hotel California all the way through to
the responses despedido
appreciating what each era has to offer
transitioning from one song to another
in a smooth way is not as easy and
immediate as you might think it involves
being witty spontaneous and most
importantly passionate as with every
profession we do have our challenges
song requests millions and millions of
song requests simply put that&#39;s a DJ&#39;s
worst nightmare I to understand that the
songs played aren&#39;t to everyone&#39;s liking
and requests are fine but when people
come at you with an outrageous attitude
getting pissed off if you do not play
the song they have in mind that&#39;s when
you might start asking yourself if they
even realize that you two are a
professional and that you expect to be
treated as such
in fact the non-stopping requests remind
me of a small incident I was as usual
DJing and it seemed that most of the
crowd enjoyed a specific genre so I
stuck with that in hopes of freezing the
majority of the audience they came to
have fun and I was granting them that I
see this random guy walking up to me
with a flash memory and playing that I
should just throw away my tracks and
play whatever he had being the
professional that I am I checked the
songs out and they were a genre almost
completely opposite to what the crowd
won&#39;t enjoy so I told the guy that the
audience seems to prefer what I was
playing at that moment put the ESB aside
and continued in hopes of the guy
forgetting about it but he didn&#39;t he
would come up every 15 minutes and
insist on his playlist
once again I continued to be patient and
gestured to the fellow that I would do
it later as it wasn&#39;t the right time
only to be confronted by the worst
attitude and the loveliest hand gestures
he ended up ruining my night and was
escorted out by the security staff
this man is soon that I&#39;m a jukebox that
he can enter it a coin and choose
whatever song he wishes to listen to
people including my friends often
overlook the dark side of my job
overlooked the fact that I&#39;m not always
cheering happy I&#39;m a human who&#39;s not
always treated as such sometimes among
the mood to party I&#39;m anxious and
frustrated I want to be alone in a quiet
place all by myself curled up in my bed
hiding under my blanket and maybe put on
some music that pleases me and only me
but end up being amongst the crowd
expected to set the beat with the press
of a button I end up doing so because
I&#39;m a professional and because I have
committed to none of the audience can
tell that there is that there&#39;s anything
wrong with me because normally and
parties you check the food the music the
decorations and many other details
except the humans behind those details
for instance on one of those days I was
so out of it that I ended up mixing R&amp;B
Woodhouse for those of you who do not
know the technicality of it our MV is 80
to 100 beats per minute
eh-eh whereas house is 120 to 130 beats
per minute
[Music]
so to jump from R&amp;B to house is a
disaster it&#39;s like moving a kid who can
barely do simple additions to compute
complex fractions sometimes I miss out
on huge personnel events for the sake of
the job it has been a long time since
I&#39;ve celebrated New Year&#39;s Eve with my
family in France because every year I&#39;m
deejaying somewhere it&#39;s always a great
atmosphere and good money on New Year&#39;s
but no amount of money can replace the
quality time spent with my loved ones I
strive for people to perceive me as a
professional and as a human hence it&#39;s
time for you to put yourself in my shoes
I look forward to a wild audience not a
rude crowd that can never be pleased
it&#39;s a give-and-take a mutual
relationship it is also important that
the audience technologists that I&#39;m a
human have feelings and a bit of
appreciation pace if I&#39;m here to say
anything today that is that it takes two
to tango and trust me
I&#39;m quite a good dancer thank you
[Applause]
