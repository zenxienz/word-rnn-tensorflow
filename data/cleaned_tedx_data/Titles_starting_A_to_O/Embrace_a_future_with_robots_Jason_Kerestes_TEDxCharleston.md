I&#39;m a welder I use electricity to melt
pieces of metal together and I used to
work for an aerospace manufacturer that
made jet engines and I welded for him
and I was one of those employees that
took a lot of pride in my work I was
good and I knew it
I came in early every day my welds
looked beautiful you could hang them up
like they were artwork and I always did
my best but my best wasn&#39;t good enough
and I was replaced and whether I want to
admit it or not my replacement was a
better welder than I was my replacement
could weld faster more consistently and
my replacement wasn&#39;t just there early
my replacement was there all the time
because my replacement was a robot but
that was years ago and today I&#39;m not
just a welder today I&#39;m a robotic
engineer and I&#39;m developing robots that
displace other people the same way those
welding robots did to me and I&#39;m seeing
something change I&#39;m seeing a difference
because the robots that are being
developed now are smarter and looking
back on my own journey I can see some
similarities or some critical aspects
that I want to share with you you see I
wanted to find out about how this scrap
of metal this motors and computer could
do something better than I could do on
my best days so I started learning
something new I was practicing learning
something new every day and I bought a
microcontroller and I started teaching
myself how to program and I also started
going back to school for engineering I
had to find out something to do and when
I was going back to school I was running
a small welding business and somebody
approached me and asked me to do some
welding for him they asked me to build
this frame on the back of a golf cart I
had no idea what it was and once again
my curiosity was piqued I wanted to
learn something new and I found out that
they were gonna tow somebody from a golf
cart they were actually gonna pull
somebody and make them run 15 miles an
hour and measure the force that it took
to do that I also learned that this was
part of a larger military robotics
project called 4mm
where the military wanted to make super
soldiers that were capable of running a
four-minute mile it also turned out that
the researcher that asked me to do that
welding he was here from France on a
visa and his visa was about to expire so
through a turn of events I ended up
developing the world&#39;s first robotic
exoskeleton that&#39;s actually capable of
augmenting your human capabilities
making it easier to run and now this
robot is smart but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m
talking about the robot was capable of
knowing your motions and understanding
its environment to help you not hurt you
but in order to understand what I&#39;m
really talking about with robots getting
smart we need to talk about what a robot
is and when I say robot many of you
probably think something like this a
vacuum that goes around cleaning your
floor or maybe something you&#39;ve seen in
a movie or maybe you don&#39;t really know
what a robot is but it&#39;s so much more
than that because the truth is any one
of us could go down to a dealership
today and drive home a robot the cars of
today are capable of knowing what Lane
you&#39;re in augmenting your driving
capability preventing you from getting
into a wreck by all means that&#39;s a robot
right in fact what many of you have
brought with you today
I would consider a robot as well your
phones are capable of processing data
capable of controlling your house your
thermostat your lights and if a phone
can be a robot then how about software
you know companies are utilizing big
data processing millions of data points
faster than a human could ever do to
spit out answers to spit out information
they&#39;re using this capability in ways
we&#39;ve never imagined in fact your phone
is probably capable of unlocking based
on facial recognition and Google is even
using the same technology to generate
keywords to recognize certain artifacts
and I know what you all like to do on
the internet and that recognition is
actually being used for Kitty
recognition as well but what does that
mean it means that there&#39;s no finite
definition of a robot because robotics
is changing all the time we&#39;re coming up
with new ways to utilize robotics but
that&#39;s not even what it&#39;s about
you see I work for one of the world&#39;s
largest aviation manufacturers I work in
research and development and one of my
customers is the military they deep
paint aircraft they actually have to go
and sand these aircraft and remove the
paint to see what&#39;s underneath make sure
the plane is still air worthy and the
robots that I&#39;m developing we&#39;re using
industry it&#39;s not just me doing this but
we have a robot that we&#39;re developing
they can go up to a plane not just a
particular plane but any plane and what
would normally take 30 to 40,000 hours
to program can be done by the robot
itself in under a minute the robot is
capable of programming itself this is
the change that I&#39;m talking about robots
are getting smarter and it&#39;s applicable
in so many ways that we can&#39;t even
imagine where it can be applied but
what&#39;s critical is that&#39;s something that
we can do as humans right now we can get
smarter right in fact that technology
that&#39;s being used to identify kittens
for your browsing pleasure is also being
used to identify abnormalities and
x-rays that&#39;s happening right now
somebody that went to school is a
radiologist and thinks that they are
perfectly secure there&#39;s technologies
branching out in so many different ways
and when you think about the long-term
effects of it when you go to the
hospital and your radiologist is looking
at some x-ray that you have to determine
what&#39;s wrong with you and they&#39;ve worked
a 12-hour shift and they&#39;re tired and
they&#39;re fatigued well guess what robots
don&#39;t get fatigued they get better and
those sanding robots that I&#39;m working on
it&#39;s actually being driven based on
economics the workers that do that work
right now sand with heavy Sanders over
their head all day rotator like rips are
the most common issue and they&#39;re
breathing cancerous causing hexavalent
chromium the point is is that robots are
going to impact each and every one of
our lives surgeons will be able to
operate across the globe they already
are using this technology but the real
key point here is that it doesn&#39;t mean
that jobs are just going to disappear
Amazon has
recently invested nearly three-quarters
of a billion dollars in the robotics but
they&#39;ve also created a hundred thousand
new jobs but those jobs are highly
technical skilled jobs you see what this
means is that we all have a chance to
learn something new and just like my
story
a welder learning robotics a robotic
engineer learning how to give a talk in
front of thousands of people we never
know what opportunities are going to
come from it I&#39;m not saying you need to
go learn about robotics I&#39;m saying you
need to learn something you need to push
yourself outside of that comfort zone
because then you will create
opportunities you control your own luck
and whether you&#39;re retired or young
especially if you&#39;re retired it&#39;s your
duty to make sure that the new
generations the younger generations get
to this sooner get to learn things
because it&#39;s going to impact them so
much more even restaurants are opening
up fully autonomously they literally
have robotic chefs or robotic bartenders
jobs that new normal students would use
to put themselves through school I think
the main thing that I want you to take
away from this is that today my robots
learn something new what did you learn
thank you
