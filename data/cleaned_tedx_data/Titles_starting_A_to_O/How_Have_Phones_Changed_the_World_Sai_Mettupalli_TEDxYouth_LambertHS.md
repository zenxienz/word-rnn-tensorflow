so number one you got it first all right
you guys kids that with your really good
flight oriented what if I told that a
leopard gecko help the safe way
despite enormous only tear on for when
you&#39;re thirty years
pew research knocks that over eighty six
percent of adults age 18 April now
imagine that is e times the way of the
curtain that was the way of the first
one now this may be a fifteen eight
hundred thousand these four thousand
dollars for something that way and it
seems like a joke to me laugh ruckus but
we take repeated that world fools have
changed so much in education also
engineering cause we don&#39;t realize that
there&#39;s a lot of applications for I have
to get home and I have to lose the
advantage and you know be their own
faces house and you know dollar forward
and they&#39;re like I can only
we can talk for a long time anytime
anywhere either
[Music]
[Music]
but phones a lot more than just it just
they can stay out recently an LCS or
less the Low Countries
hold em home or mobile health coverage
basically a person can text an image of
a super their condition and their area
[Music]
without surgery would be like you know
we don&#39;t realize themselves
[Music]
then I&#39;m going to hold on and this
picture this could be I could end up so
let me take this for granted but we see
that the death throes web search for
words like certain numbers of completely
changed like as a person walks on your
life hopping both legs have changed the
way people you know previously we
thought under control like just if it&#39;s
a telephone and it was just football but
modern phones like iPhones and androids
they can click to play games you can
make no need to give it an email and you
can do let&#39;s go
which leads to our next point about like
economy ready color with legitimate or
[Music]
[Music]
even maybe not here but anywhere there&#39;s
somebody&#39;s speech or do something you
always bones can actually
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we think it but we&#39;re stealing every day
these program is for your new ones and
new technologies satisfy people well we
know that some whenever you
and what have we&#39;ve been completely
change the way so both ways have changed
the way
