all right whenever mother or is even see
the picture I have four of them I four
kids but the young kids maybe sits in my
left if you judge by the length of my
hair you will know that she&#39;s now four
years old now with my firstborn when I
had my first child she changed my life
totally changed my life and this is one
of the things that I want to share a
little bit I&#39;ve done maybe six times
already
I&#39;m also a 10x fellow so every single
time now that I get invited to a TEDx
speech I try to come up with a different
theory and that&#39;s an idea to share and I
find today sharing to be really really
close to my heart I used to like to play
one sets with my kids do you play that
game with your parents or someone like
you pretend that I&#39;m once a day and I&#39;m
going to scare you I want to catch you
in a tickle you and the babies are you
so I do that with my kids a lot one day
one day she ran into a corner and I were
step up because I&#39;m going to show you
how she did it so she read there ain&#39;t
no way to run right and here is going in
my head whoa I got her in a corner I&#39;m
really gonna tickle though whoa tell me
about your mommy so big so me I&#39;m so
never tickle you and then at that point
and this isn&#39;t that something that
changed the way I look at things for
quite a bit
she&#39;s very little bit sure it&#39;s here
instead of crying because she lost the
game she turned around and she went like
I&#39;m the monster now
and while she was eating my day she was
not teaching my babies naked stuff like
that I&#39;m thinking oh my god just happen
what exactly just happened I don&#39;t think
I would have done that look in life in
life
we are cornered a lot of times we face
we come to a wall BAM a lot of time and
then we just go like we&#39;re stuck
we give up forget it you know we lost
how could a child be cornered and turn
the entire table around what exactly
happened what went wrong is it because
we think so differently we got it wrong
and that the child is teaching me
something so a certainly correct if your
coordinate jeez what corner turn around
quite a different way have to courage
face the monster being ones or yourself
the options are limitless
I was super curious I also again and
again and again so when you were running
what happened
simoom when you were ready to is the
wall what were you thinking on is my
question to like a like a like a total
my two-year-old baby who&#39;s hot be able
to say anything and after a lot of
talking I&#39;m not talking about talking
she&#39;s just a nice mommy
you don&#39;t meet rules I also can be cruel
to say it&#39;s amazing that is amazing
because if she was thinking that way
that means the question she asked
herself before she came up with the
conclusion was who made those rules who
say this is my mom&#39;s gave who say I can
turn right to call her back who say I
don&#39;t want change their goals so if she
has that pot processes in her why did we
lose it as we grow up why do we as we go
older see a lot of things among problems
or issues love things that didn&#39;t go
right you know when we plan a and
slightly going to be with we think it&#39;s
going wrong this is not the way supposed
to be why do we have that recall feeling
what went wrong
maybe it&#39;s the way we ask questions I
think you guys know the story when we
would thought the concept of one husband
always one how how white where why who I
do not subscribe to more than one wife
just so you know I think it&#39;s too much
work already or one wife and you want to
marry so many things anyway okay so in
school when we ask questions we need the
answer so sometimes we look at our says
there we ask questions if everyone
thought how to ask the questions by
looking at the answers you can answer
this Ted only compute the questions
that&#39;s how we learn how to ask questions
that&#39;s how we don&#39;t have to put the
question mark and we all know the story
we go to school in a class of 40 people
after one session of 40 minutes maybe
one out of 39 people 40 people get asked
a question only one the rest of us
didn&#39;t have a chance over time how many
are in school twelve loving yes it&#39;s
because school over time not having
enough
and asking questions and then something
University lecture would look at you and
say all right any question what happened
when the lecture ask you any question it
is not just a university level right
we&#39;re talking about like international
forces its initial me after a press
conference all right any questions you
know all the white house clippings that
you see even we don&#39;t want Trump and you
ask and you question it every go like
that that&#39;s because they already know
what question it was at us and nothing
to do with the kind of things that is
related to what key thing is that was
they have about doc so it&#39;s always about
that people are increasingly as they
grow older like the ability to ask
questions and if you think ha when I
always ask question wall I always ask so
what&#39;d you get ah I also ask so where do
we go to the other day I always like I
don&#39;t know what to where I want to turn
it is not real question because these
questions don&#39;t change the wall and
they&#39;ll chase you don&#39;t make an impact
don&#39;t make a difference
okay so happy to the real question what
happens are the questions that you
really can ask whenever thought of
asking or consider for example sorry
I&#39;ll come back to it for example why do
you this way to name it where does he
live
what do you answer yes but no time I
want to tell you there&#39;s totally Google
Earth
but if you look at this what is the
answer you&#39;re gonna get an address
laughs or a country done or a city la
food spot laughs what else but if you
change the question slightly so why did
it live there you uncover a completely
different idea of why the culture of
that person the person that she or he is
the way it is is caused by the
Anthropology the background the culture
the history the breakdown the family
bring down the segmentation what class
are you
you constantly could now relate to this
person in front of you it becomes
different you see the world a completely
different life so why do we ask
questions that can find on google or do
a little bit of research but we are not
daring ourselves to ask questions that
gives us more insight so that we could
do more things if I question like for
example where is the school again this
is all very good good of it maybe the
question is to be one please learn no
school yeah
Calma problems great awesome and then oh
she&#39;s very smug now
but and then the question is to be okay
is there anything we can do things
should never be at a full stop light is
never being is never about the answer
life is about the question the answers
are as your questions are the hunters
are there is how you are asking me to
retreat the question to retrieve the
answers if you think about this properly
so if your questions are not right your
odds is going to sound like a full stop
or come with the on second comma
problems I just want to say in a text
format right audience tones deep but
it&#39;s interesting that you do because
then I can reply it is not just that
each and every one of us need to be
playing a role each and every one of us
has the ability to do something beyond
the idea is that we could see beyond the
idea that you are here you are here
because you are looking for ideas you
are here because you want to do more
than just play make the government it&#39;s
very easy to lay out the complaints I
can tell you already and it&#39;s also
absolutely easy to just say that we&#39;re
not gonna work okay
what can you do at your level so perhaps
the questions need to be why why is that
the issue like that why is it done with
the problem
only why Cannot it why could it be
artists with it in this country I am not
willing to sit down here and with
another 30 years 40 and 50 to happen and
I have no patent doing something about
that I want to be doing something I
wanna totally contribute and make sure
that it is the world I want to live in
government is such a small part of how
the world be and is going to be 25 the
why not the what years
when you are when you have the courage
to answer these questions when you have
the courage to ask questions you will be
delighted and absolutely enlightening
and like them by the way you think
by the way you feel that you could find
an ancestor words it is not just because
I said hey consider asking the right
question and your world will change and
right now now that is it acutely
consider not on the seedier to ask the
right question open my eyes might want
me English for any change to happen you
need to print it he for so many years
we&#39;ve given up on asking questions and
when the idea here is ask the right
question you will find more ideas to do
amazing things but to answer my
questions is a practice it isn&#39;t just
Humpty like that you need to be doing it
again and again and again I think that
this is not the right question I think
is not it I want to ask a different
question
Hey then if maybe there is another way
to ask this question I&#39;m not breathing
it right so for example one of the
amazing things that we did so this is a
bus station it&#39;s a bus stop okay this is
the back of the bus stop the front of it
I didn&#39;t have a picture because I wanted
to show you what we were doing here we
we took over a bus stop it but Regina
I&#39;ve become really changed it the back
of it is what I want to talk about
because this is crazy
it is called the best English team so
what we&#39;re doing that we got people to
come to the vending machine put money
liquid because we go to a process you
kind of make believe you go through it
you put money down one we get huh why I
think it okay they can walk from one end
of the
to another end of the bus stop to decide
what is it you&#39;d like to buy and the
stuff we&#39;re selling a stuff like by
sabar but limit last minute extra about
you lumbar you buy extras the full of
minute in your bag with the mobile home
you could only wonder why my mouth goes
deep boob I talked about really building
things but no drama boob I know I yeah
and you can imagine I think we drew some
thousand across that was it different
solutions across the bottom the
different bus stops that we have made
and turned every to what does it do
is it of like me talking like there&#39;s
telling people to consider what is it
about their lives that they want to
change and reconsider we get it to just
have go through this exercise and find
out for themselves
how did a meeting with lies the next
refer tip minutes could you really buy
it
what if you can but did you already ways
that extra for 10 minutes
the idea that ready chef just now when I
have a good appetite
when you talk about the fact that if the

meetings that one he likes is at 12:45
my hash tag is always why be on time
when you can&#39;t be early you know you
don&#39;t get just fits in minute you gain
or admit sad the team that&#39;s what you
get but this exercise that a lot of
people come come come by and that&#39;s a
lot of really interesting questions to
us which we then collected and we talk
about it
different workshops and we bring that to
different children across the schools in
the country to talk about the things
that they would do is these are the
problems we are something these are your
problems if it is your problem
do you have solutions to solve it and
under this we came up with programs like
yahoo changemakers where children feel
all fifteen years old and doing amazing
things to solve your community problems
we have a childhood six years old and
she baked cakes so that she can raise
funds for the operation around her house
she started doing it at five because she
wanted to help his sister who was brain
damage
yeah to to to make money so that she can
send her for treatment in America but
it&#39;s an amazing shirin stories that we
were sharing and if you ask the right
questions you realize that you have the
opportunity to really treat bigger we
brought this show in from Spain and the
question at that point was and what
people don&#39;t know that Kippur is
happening in this country over there a
lot of amazing shows happening but they
like to go shopping
and every time they go shopping on top
of that every company hey it&#39;s like I&#39;m
shopping I don&#39;t know what else to do
like there&#39;s nothing else to do in
Malaysia short long really or are you
just too comfortable to do other things
our country&#39;s so blessed but all we do
is shop north so we brought the aunts to
the people we brought up to the shopping
mall because people like to just shot
right and we managed to turn a lot of
people into audiences because they&#39;ve
never seen things like this and they
realize that oh there&#39;s just so much
more things to do we brought people
artists from different countries
together and yeah infirmity famosa
each one of them actually playing a rock
of a family and the discussion trulia
physical I should
acting was about how we have been
treating heritage how do we have been
what kind of relationship we are having
with the things around us material
spaces do we treat em like we come to
the space or in an auditorium for stop
we don&#39;t imagine anything else we don&#39;t
imagine what is all the audience sit
here on the stage and you watch
something happen on the see the
intention is when you challenge to know
when you challenge what you see it
really gives you new idea you don&#39;t
necessarily have to do it but when it
gives you new idea you realize that your
brain has just started to like a flower
this is a black box that we built in the
middle of pavilion bringing us to other
people this has become best practice
around the role and we talk about it all
the time because it&#39;s 25 minutes every
single twig 5 minutes of the show from
different countries around the world
that we brought into this box
there are amazing doors if you could see
the front of McCullough thing there are
3 doors like that one is the normal
sized one like this the next one is half
the signs this is another small one
really really tiny like the small at the
end and the people who saw it the people
who saw the difference who asked the
questions would discover the beauty they
Wellcome to do small things they will
open the door and they will see the
magic that I&#39;m not telling you the magic
bark mix like Maddie&#39;s
come on and yeah this is a book written
getting more people wanting to consider
becoming a superpower you have a
superpower wouldn&#39;t tell you that one
person can do a lot of things so don&#39;t
just depend on other people you can get
there the world does need more superhero
and I liked it by you to join me in this
moment
I know time&#39;s up - really when you come
to a tenant&#39;s and I have been managing
and organizing TEDx a lot I like to
invite each one of you to stand up right
now I&#39;m the last speaker so I have to
write - okay you have had a full day a
full day of ideas being thrown at you
thrown at your throat and you answer
them you actually do in just two seconds
of you closing your eyes right now just
close your eyes and the ones who can&#39;t
close their eyes usually I can tell you
this is because you&#39;re not comfortable
with yourself
don&#39;t worry nobody&#39;s looking you except
me just close your eyes I will give you
five seconds of silence where you will
review the day and let the idea that
really gets to you stick in your head
and you tell your brain does you need to
tell your braces let be seed let this
become the seed for me to bring on to
the world new ideas five seconds
