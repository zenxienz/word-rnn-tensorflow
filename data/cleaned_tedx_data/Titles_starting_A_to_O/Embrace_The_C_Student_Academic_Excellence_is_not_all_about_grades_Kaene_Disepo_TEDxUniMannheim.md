before I can start well quite frankly I
was not sure how I can begin my speech I
was like well should I start off by
giving my my life story about this young
African who now seems to have made it
now that you know he&#39;s in Germany and
giving a TED talk or do I talk about my
my life credentials as if I&#39;m laying out
my CV I saw that this KPMG here so this
would be a great platform for me to do
my CV but I quickly remembered the words
of one of my great friends now she would
always say start from the beginning the
beginning is always good and make sure
you don&#39;t leave anything behind now mind
you she would always talk about
gossiping and she wanted all the scoops
so it was good for her that I had to
start from the beginning and leave out
any details but one thing I also
remember is well we&#39;re not here to
gossip and we don&#39;t have all day as much
as I would love that
about a month ago I was back in Botswana
I go there every summer but Sunday&#39;s
where I&#39;m from
for people that don&#39;t know where that is
they South Africa where you had your
2010 FIFA World Cup then right on top of
that is persona and you know I always
give motivational talks when I&#39;m back in
Busan I go back to check my friends my
family of course my project my project
and I remember this one time I was asked
to give a motivational talk at my form
of high school and the motivational talk
was partly inspired by the fact that it
was a prize giving ceremony and I was
asked to talk about rewarding quality
performance a key to a sustainable human
resource now of course I knew given the
occasion
what the
we&#39;ll be asking for me you know they
will want me to talk about academics
they want me to talk about inspiring you
know children and students alike and
really talking about you know focus on
your books get good grades education is
the key to success you know the normal
blah blah blah but what I really wanted
to say was something fundamentally
different
so here yeah it&#39;s like three o&#39;clock in
the morning I&#39;m drafting my speech and
I&#39;m just so into it so passionate about
it and you know I decide that okay I&#39;m
gonna share the little that I wrote with
my partner now he goes I absolutely
loved this speech I loved it but he
keeps staring at me funny I was like
okay but he&#39;s like but I was like oh god
see I knew something was out he&#39;s like
but I don&#39;t think this is the right time
or place for that you know you want to
inspire students not necessarily
discourage them now mind you at this
time I&#39;m just absolutely shattered I&#39;m
thinking oh damn it he&#39;s right no he&#39;s
always right but I was like I really
wanted to talk about this but luckily I
got the invite for the TED talk I was
like oh my god yes such a perfect
opportunity for me to do that and what I
really wanted to talk about was convey
and narrative was partly inspired by my
best friend brother mentor and mentee
and now mentor again we have such a
weird relationship he spoke of the type
a Type B type C students and those are
the students that strangely enough he
saw you know in me this type a student
was the student or the kind that enjoyed
the assortment of alcohol a lot
he would always find you no time to
enjoy the simple pleasures of life but
more so he lacked emotional intelligence
I lived in a one-room in a single room
in one of Botswana&#39;s poorest
neighborhood in the capital city after
my parents separated and at the time
that&#39;s all I knew I knew that you know
for me to avoid my stress my pain I
would drink alcohol I would have a pint
a German pint we didn&#39;t have it but
again I liked the right avenues then I
found the Type B student
the kind that enjoyed reading books the
bookworm for I believe that academic
excellence was my guarantor to success
in life and that in a sense that&#39;s how
we&#39;re socialized with socialized to
think that if you get your good grades
you get to a university a local
university life is great you graduate
you get a job and I must tell you it
actually did work out for me quite well
from that single room which I used to
call my four in one my bedroom my living
room my bathroom and my kitchen
I actually I wrote my GCSEs and in the
middle of my GCSEs my parents finalized
a divorce from that four and one I
actually got the second-best grades and
my GCSEs in the whole country and you
know at the time well I was expecting
claps but it&#39;s okay
[Applause]
but well you know I&#39;m partly selling my
CV so but at the time I eat I was
worried I was like oh my god why was I
worried the Botswana examination
cancelled they wanted to interview me
they wanted to see where you know I grew
up I said well it&#39;s great I&#39;m gonna be
on TV
but the problem is you know where
they&#39;re going to interview me yes like
no not that one room and I realized that
I have an opportunity I can either
contact my mom and ask for a distant
aunt who I have no idea where she stays
but I&#39;m told she&#39;s rich and I&#39;ve never
been to her house and I can go there and
then they can bring the TV there or I
actually have a platform to showcase
that we are not defined by our
circumstances but rather how we overcome
them and how in a sense we do that it&#39;s
a showcase that we can be proud of where
we grew up
that you can be born in a family of
poverty but that does not mean that at
the end of the day that&#39;s how your life
is going to be so they came they were
surprised you know the cameraman was
like I think that&#39;s the number one see I
knew why he would say that well it&#39;s
because you know I mean look I was
studying but I knew that the tab&#39;
student worked great what great because
that&#39;s how I was raised
however when I got the boots on a top
achiever scholarship program which is an
innocent and initiative that gives at
high achieving students the platform to
go abroad and feather that studies
anywhere in the world they choose to do
from Foundation to PhD I quickly learned
of the type C student the chaser so I
came to the United Kingdom in 2012 and I
went to the best independent sixth-form
but when I got there see I already had a
working formula I knew that okay you
know hard work determination equals
academic excellence academic excellence
equals getting a good job
but the executive director at the time
now she would always say numbers don&#39;t
lie but you need to do more and make do
more like she&#39;s serious
like I&#39;m not sure you know busting my 20
get bigger grades and now she&#39;s telling
me I need to do more but what I realized
is one thing that&#39;s fundamentally
different about getting to the best
universities
well actually any university in the
first world country is that as much as
you can get the grades that&#39;s okay but
that&#39;s not enough
do you need to do something more you
needed to have work experience you
needed to volunteer to do your social
responsibilities you needed to read
books outside the curriculum now I loved
the system I loved chasing of the
opportunities that were not necessarily
you know available to me and it&#39;s
because of that system that I actually
broke a couple of boats on the histories
I gained I&#39;m selling my CV you know I
became the youngest male Madonna
you know most honest a citizen of
persona obviously the youngest male
Madonna at the age of 18 to have wet
placement at the United Nations in
Switzerland and at the same time I
represented my country in over 10
different countries when I was still a
teen as a youth delegate now to some
well if you&#39;re in the UK it&#39;s not
necessarily a big deal but in Botswana
it&#39;s a great deal because they didn&#39;t
have that system and I&#39;ve realized that
well now this is the time to really
change the narrative of academic
excellence that gone are the times when
just focusing on your grades actually
guaranteed you a job why am I saying
that it&#39;s because when I got to
university I realized the system hasn&#39;t
necessarily changed we work so hard to
to university but once we get to
university we strive to only get either
a first a distinction or two one we
forget other life skills and what
happens is you see the incessant growth
of youth and employment from where you
also find graduates unemployed reason
being is we&#39;re all the same and paper
one thing I truly love and respect about
Germany is there you know perhaps
celebration of vocational training
institutions they have this amazing you
know dual variational training program
where they mix theory and practice
something which is starkly missing from
Botswana or other sub-saharan countries
now you wonder why Germany is such an
economic powerhouse you wonder why
Germany enjoys comparative advantage in
sectors such as manufacturing because
they know that you also have different
talents you have different skills that
it&#39;s not every single person who aspires
to be a lawyer an engineer or a doctor
we need to nurture and celebrate talents
talents in all their different forms now
in Botswana I&#39;ve actually started an
initiative of taking my first step
towards really ensuring that we need to
change the narrative of academic
excellence what did I do
I said my organization inspired Horizons
and what it does is it tries to change
the narrative of academic excellence
through channeling and actually
providing opportunities that are
fundamentally lacking in the education
system we&#39;ve noticed that we have
challenged with financial illiteracy we
lack intrapreneurial skills we lack
mentor initiatives we also like things
like career coaching
business mentoring and this are
initiatives that are missing in the
education system what we want to do is
we want to implement them within the
core curriculum we want to showcase that
if you are a high achiever then all this
thing&#39;s all those great you know life
skills you needed to have developed them
as well to fully become a well-rounded
individual and a well-rounded individual
it&#39;s a passionate leader a leader who
does not only strive to be successful in
their community but one who strives to
be valuable to their community now I am
keine disciple it&#39;s a very difficult
name to realize it&#39;s guy in a and a
mouth sure as a young 23 year old from a
small village in the north of Botswana
and also the central persona raised by a
former a retired military soldier and a
teacher and in Germany telling you that
we need to do more gone are the days
when graduating guaranteed a job I just
graduated at the London School of
Economics in Bachelor of Sciences
international relations and I graduated
having been recognized as the second
best black student in the UK a rare
rising star not only that but I also got
recognized as the young Future leader on
Britain of African and Caribbean descent
2016-2017 what that meant is I realized
that for us to succeed in life getting
the grades is not enough
let&#39;s do more let&#39;s think better let&#39;s
be great academic rewarding quality
performance is not just about academics
academic excellence it&#39;s not just about
grades let&#39;s embrace the C student the
chaser thank you so much for having me
[Applause]
