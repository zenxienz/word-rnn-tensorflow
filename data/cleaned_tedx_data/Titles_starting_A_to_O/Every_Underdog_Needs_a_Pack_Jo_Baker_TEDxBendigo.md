beautiful good morning what do you think
about what you say man hang on to that
for a second
I was born in New Zealand
my dad was an Australian my mum was in
New Zealand er they met early mulliner
on a holiday dalliance and I was the
second born in my family a few years
later we came to live in Australia
my mum was one of eleven siblings and
she left that all behind she didn&#39;t have
a mom or or any of their family and we
came to Australia my dad was a police
officer and he saw things that no human
being should see it affected him so
about it and he started to drink he
couldn&#39;t talk about what he had seen so
he drank to try and forget what he had
seen it wasn&#39;t long before that time
wasn&#39;t long after that time that things
started to get very ugly my family
we went through being an average
everyday family - a family that lived
with domestic abuse domestic violence
and it could erupt like that we could be
sitting at the dinner table just like
thousands of families in our community
and all of a sudden place fine people
were running and kids were scared and we
lived like that for quite some time
until my mum thought you know mom I
can&#39;t take this anymore and she decided
that she was getting out of his life
fortunately for my mum she was found in
time and she&#39;s very happy even living a
full life
it needs out of us today from that point
on I was this kid that had a lot of
anxiety some of the advantages of living
in that time and living that way issue
became a really good observer of body
language there were certain things that
I could see my dad that told me that
we&#39;re in trouble and there were certain
ways that my mum would look at my dad
that told me that we were ready for a
pretty bumpy ride but of course I was
just a kid I didn&#39;t know how to cope
with that so I began to eat and I began
to eat sugary things that made me feel
good and as you can see I still lived
with the consequences of that road when
I was in year six finally my parents
decided to go their separate ways
and it was interesting I can remember
thinking to myself I am so relieved that
I don&#39;t have to live like this anymore
but at the same time I was devastated
because I was my father&#39;s daughter and
we were now moving away from him he was
this man I idolized even in his own
imperfection I idolized him he was a man
of wisdom and courage and brokenness all
at the same time so we moved and we had
to go into hiding because my dad wasn&#39;t
really very depressed about everybody
leaving and I remember we left the
family dogs which for all of us kids was
incredibly devastating and we lived in
fear for quite some time we had to keep
moving because we didn&#39;t have any family
in Australia so we were basically on on
the poverty line and we get a house and
then
but the rent and we have to move and
that went I think we worked out in the
first 18 years of my life or after after
my parents divorced we move 21 times and
twice because my father had found out
where we lived
my dad disengaged and I barely saw him
from that time on and that was really
salt destroying for me
musics Catholic school education having
a great time
all-girls school now I&#39;m going to a
co-ed system we used to wear skirts
right down to our ankles at the Catholic
Church and yet I&#39;m sure you can imagine
this is now in the nineteen seventies of
of New South Wales and it was a very
different scene for those of you that
laughs um nope lol I arrived with my
first school day we&#39;ve established at
that breakfast and my skirt down to my
ankles and I stuck out like a sore thumb
I almost got beaten up my first day at
school
I don&#39;t I still don&#39;t understand why but
to survive I had to adapt improvise and
overcome which I did too and it wasn&#39;t
long before I attracted the attention of
the cool crowd I was a little bit
different little bit quirky and I was
invited here but they did some not so
nice things to people
and now I was a part of this group is
part of this pack and for the first time
in a long time I felt like I was
connected I was part of something bigger
than myself
but then one of the most healthiest pack
in the world there was drinking and
drugs and boys and taking off from
school and although that really didn&#39;t
to me or I had this connection people
actually I felt like people cared about
man so I let down my garden away we went
a few years into high school the
leatherby girl that was in charge of
this group the pact lender so to me
the top dog she decided to randomly that
this girl who I didn&#39;t know from Paris
Oh was going to be in trouble and they
were going to follow her at lunch line
just because they can and there was
something inside of me that that didn&#39;t
sit right with so we ended up having
this big argument I lost my friends I
lost my group and I went back to feeling
all alone in the big world the
interesting thing is the girl that they
were going to be helping we became very
good friends and over time I lipstick we
still in touch today but here I was
disconnected again high school was not
the most pleasant experience for that
kid it&#39;s a lot better now I&#39;m told but
at that time it&#39;s a it&#39;s a complicated
place got out of school I failed my HST
had no prospects I couldn&#39;t even get
Franklin&#39;s to give me a job what was the
point I started being drinking doing all
those things that you do and you&#39;re just
trying to mitigate the pain and I was
lost I was terribly terribly lost this
went on for about five years and I
finally got to the place where I was
just exhausted with life when I was two
I drowned and I was critically dead on
arrival at hospital and I used to have
this fight with God you know this was
the best
[Music]
just let me die then why have I got to
come through all this pain and
misreading if this is the best it gets
and it&#39;s I was so angry that I was put
in this position when there was an out
there was a doorway I I could have
walked through it I was already dead and
I was angry at the next-door neighbor
that saw me floating in the water
you know how dead he jumped in and saved
me now I&#39;ve got to do this thing for
life
anyway it was it was a place where I
just felt like I was all on my own
I used to go up to my my younger brother
my stepfather wasn&#39;t a very nice man you
know he played a lot of psychological
games so I&#39;d remember one time something
had been broken in the house and I knew
I hadn&#39;t done it but by the end of that
day but he convinced me I had so it was
just tough growing up was tough and I
couldn&#39;t see any lies at the end of the
time my other brother moved out he&#39;s
only two years younger than I am
and he came to live here with me for a
while and that was nice that was nice to
have a sense of family and the innocence
connection and we had a great time and I
became like a surrogate mum I&#39;d always
kind of felt guilty and I&#39;ve left you in
the place that I left him so I had
running around to basketball and pick
him up after school and we used the
ladies the weight room in the library
not because I knew anything really about
libraries but just because he was
actually a really good student and I
would pick him up and I would that we
would go at home well I remember city
one day he was late and yet told me he
was going to be late and I&#39;m sitting at
this place with a whole game of books
I know it&#39;s the library but apart from
that it really served no purpose
remaining I picked up this white book
then it was the who&#39;s who of Australia
in the reference section when I just
opened it just because I was bored and I
started to read story after story of
human beings that have faced really
tough times come out the other end and
done something amazing with their lives
change something grew in some way help
somebody and I remember this day I
started crying over this book boom I&#39;m
I&#39;m never going to amount to anything I
don&#39;t even really feel I should be here
I&#39;ve got my purpose I&#39;ve got no sense of
of community on wanting out where&#39;s the
train to get me out and that&#39;s where the
Estados change
I found a packet the first hallway was a
church and people seemed to really care
and I started to feel like I was getting
some healing I was starting to save some
things and and in spite of the fact that
I was the epitome of an underdog I also
made a truckload of
more choices I started to find my feet
people started to believe in many people
started to see promising me that I
couldn&#39;t even see my next door way
through it was a place for Rogers pups
here was this group of people that were
trying to do something beautiful with
nothing they had no money they had no
space but they wanted to work with kids
that were struggling they wanted to help
kids with autism find a friend like
Jimmy and they were doing it on their
own time often in their own in their own
cars with their own dollars and it was
beautiful and I started to realize that
a big part of what I was missing was
that sense of being connected every
underdog things a pack and all over the
year is just checking the time over the
years I&#39;ve found that that sense of
community it can combine the the captain
of a football team or the lady that runs
the tuck shop that looks up through all
the kids that don&#39;t have enough money it
can be whatever manifestation or
expression you like but we are not
individuals designed to be little
islands we&#39;re interconnected
we&#39;re designed to work together and to
work for one another and work for the
one
that can&#39;t work foods elves and what I
found in community what our founding the
packs that I&#39;ve been a part of is that
when you give your life away you find
your place you find your purpose you
find your pride and you find your pack
if Rihanna donates things back and we
roll under those in one way or another
for g-pack give you all the way
[Applause]
