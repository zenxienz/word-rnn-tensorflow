probably most of you rent or own
property to live in and that you
certainly have neighbors most of you
know that if you entered your neighbor&#39;s
property without permission they could
actually get you arrested for
trespassing
but that is enforceable here in Germany
because all property are registered with
the state and therefore they are
protected by law in many countries
across the world
by contrast up to 70% of the land may be
unregistered but even for people in some
of these countries where they have a
registered land title such land titles
may not be relevant to how they live
consider for example a Massiah family
they have 800 karo 500 guards and so on
and so on donkeys and other animals they
depend on the land for all their basic
needs for the water for their food for
the food for the animals and even for
medicines for them receiving an
individual land title may actually lead
to losing access to vital resources and
in video light land title may actually
leave them worse off so as curry
mentioned I work for a project it&#39;s
called it&#39;s for land and in this project
we are creating innovative tools for
land tenure registration our goal is to
reduce high percentage of unregistered
land yeah try to bring it to zero using
new tools that can allow us to rapidly
map property the project involves 8
partners but they&#39;re spread across six
countries and I work for the Institute
for game for Mattox here in Muenster so
when we were invited to join the project
to start the project I was getting I was
really excited because the target
countries are Kenya
and Ethiopia which are all in East
Africa and that&#39;s not so far away from
my own home country of Malawi so we
started we embarked on this journey
myself as part of this team to create a
small piece of software that allows
communities at a local scale to document
their land using hand-drawn maps so for
example this one here our software
should be able to read and process the
hand-drawn sketches understand what is
drawn in them and then organize them so
that they can be used with other data
about land so this was our goal and with
that in mind we set off we set to work
we created some preliminary designs and
you know built a prototype we even
tested our workflows on a site here in
Germany but fast forward a few months we
arrived in the Muslim Messiah County of
southern Kenya called Kathy Otto and
almost as soon as we arrived all our
plans which we had met which we had
planned everything to the minute started
to fall apart so all our assumptions
were actually basically wrong it so
happens that when we arrived there there
was a drought and the people needed more
time to go and find water find food for
the animals and so on in fact on the
first day that we were there we actually
caught up with the people at a local
waterhole that was the only place you
could meet people at that time of day so
we jumped straight into work we were
standing under a tree it was you know
like researchers and then the people
from the community and my colleague
serene was from the University of
Louisville started with her part of the
interview she had prepared an
unstructured interview so she started
asking questions but by the time you
know she went from the first to the
second to the third question I started
getting nervous because I was standing
next to her but the thing is I had a ten
questioni and my hands and I had
prepared everything to the minute and I
thought to myself oh wow how am I going
to perform a very structured interview
in this very dynamic scenario so but you
know before I finished thinking already
was my turn to ask questions you went
like oh it&#39;s your turn I was like oh my
god
anyway I you know I sort of put out a
question here I&#39;m like okay yeah here&#39;s
my first question
so I read the first question and the
interpreter standing next to me he
translates it to Messiah to the Messiah
language and then there&#39;s a couple of
second silence yeah and then after you
know after the silence everybody bursts
into laughter so I said okay what what
funny thing did I say I was taken aback
for a moment because because I knew my
question was playing there were about 15
I think 15 to 20 men standing around me
and there were about five others who had
just walked 30 kilometers with their
animals from from Tanzania so it&#39;s
across the border just to graze the
animals in the area okay what do I do
then I just looked back down at my
questionnaire and I read the second
question I said forget the first but by
the time I raise my head again I
realized that it wasn&#39;t always the same
faces around you know there was like
some people are standing there and then
the move on
talk to someone else and then they&#39;ll
come back maybe look at the animals a
little bit so I thought this could be
you know community few things but either
this exercise is completely boring for
these guys or they extremely busy and I
went with a second of course because
they had more immediate concerns we
found them in their place of work which
and that was and so I decided okay screw
this I put my question here back in my
pocket and just started having
conversations with them so we were just
standing and having little chats through
that we learned quite a lot for example
we learned that the Messiah never really
traditionally owned land something we
had a clue about but not in the modern
sense of owning land right so this was
always something that imposed on them
and it goes back to you know to the
colonial era most of the thing
that we that they told us you know we&#39;re
wrapped in little stories so it wasn&#39;t
like plain fact it was story after story
for example there was one young man who
came up to us and told us a story that
demonstrates a certain loose
relationship of the Messiah with Ireland
he had uncovered an anomaly so this is
uncovered something wrong in in the
boundary of a big piece of land so that
belongs to one family and when I say
family of course I don&#39;t mean husband
wife and children I mean like 10 or more
households of brothers cousins and so on
living together on a piece of land and
sharing on the resources there right
what had happened is they have you know
sort of other neighboring parcels of
land right and the people in the family
in those neighbor in those neighboring
parcels had actually subdivided their
land and then that sold and parts of
those pieces to other people in the
process
somehow the boundaries had been moved so
in favor of the new plot and so there
was a big chunk of land that was lost to
this family that was living together the
problem of course is that they discovery
though it was good that they found out
was actually 12 years too late because
in in Kenya you can only challenge the
issuance of land titles within a period
of 12 years and these registrations had
been these changes had been registered
with the state more than 20 years before
so but how could this happen so how did
they not discover this well you know it
so happens that as they live together
they they really they knew about the
boundaries but they never really
considered them as as a barrier to
movement as a restriction as if you
can&#39;t go there so when they graze their
animals when they go and collect
firewood or do other activities on land
they just criss cross down there yeah so
it didn&#39;t matter whose parcel that
really was and so sadly of course when
changes were happening in that Justin
parcels they never really bothered to
check what is going on with the
boundaries and with the actual
information that is registered so anyway
we went on with different conversations
you know later on we asked the people to
draw us some maps to illustrate the
things that they were telling us the
stories that we&#39;re telling us so here is
an example this is a
sigh homestead yeah a Massiah family
lives in a circular arrangement of huts
which is called an Incan in the middle
usually in the middle they&#39;ll have a
circular region and enclosure or several
enclosures where they keep their
domestic animals at night so this is for
protection from wild animals the
traditional Messiah hat in Indian
language is called an entity or in
Clarisse code in kijiji it looks like
this from the outside the huts are
usually they usually belong to the wives
so there will be one man for the income
and you will have seven several wives
and each wife will have her own little
Hut&#39;s for her family
every wife also has an entrance so a
gate entering into the income and she&#39;s
responsible for that yet so she&#39;s
responsible for opening it in the
morning and then closing it in the night
these gates are guarded by a big branch
of a tree which is called a no Tim once
the OU team is placed inside of this
gate then no one can enter it especially
the man yeah so the man cannot walk over
this whole team because it is in in
their culture is considered taboo and
also there is certain subtle rules about
which gates can be used for what purpose
so for example you have a gate which is
for God&#39;s only and one of the other
entrances would be for people and maybe
another one would be for like cattle
the point I want to make here is that
the messiah homestead is has a really
complex special on social structure yeah
and and this structure is very rich with
meaning unfortunately in many modern or
current information systems for
registering land this rich meaning is
lost the focus is more on parcels the
way you do it in Germany boundaries and
coordinate so when we ask them the first
time to draw these maps for us we ask
them you know those were the stupid
questions in the first interview it was
like so could you draw a map of your
land and the guys were like what the
hell are you talking about
really and and when I went back you know
when after we came back from the trip I
also asked myself the same question what
is the purpose of these drawings that
we&#39;re looking for so obviously we had to
change our strategy and so you know we
spent about four months here and then
went right back and this time we had
organized special workshops so we
actually organized things ahead of time
and we had workshops for men worships
women and during the discussions people
talked about you know what I thought
were important things for them for
example like where you know how do we
preserve our water resources or where do
the wild animals usually you know where
they usually found what are the
locations of important species of trees
or other kinds of vegetation something
we learned during the time of course
during the discussion was that the
elders seemed to have a certain special
skill to read the landscape so for
example they will look they will observe
the vegetation and then they&#39;ll go like
let&#39;s dream for water here yeah of
course the younger men don&#39;t quite
understand it I guess it only comes with
experience but I thought that this was a
deep knowledge and we wanted to capture
that knowledge yeah we wanted to get it
in our maps and so we also asked them to
draw some sketch maps for us so for
example this is one map this was drawn
by a group of women you see here some
circular some circles those represent
the homesteads you also see there&#39;s some
mountains they show the map the map is
quite detailed probably not very visible
from here but there is where do we get
the water where the wild animals and you
know all sorts of kind of features with
the main river in our region and in the
corners there&#39;s little triangles which
will represent the boundary of their
range so we&#39;re able to capture very rich
information which you do you do not find
in official records together with the
official world with a representation of
that official information about the
boundaries of their property so we can
put this these boundaries in relation to
the features that are important for them
in their lives you know we started off
with just we want to create a small tool
that digit
Maps you know maps of land land parcels
but in the process we learned that it&#39;s
not just about a piece of ground it&#39;s
about relationships between people and
their land which are often not you know
as simple or not compatible with the way
we look at land as the property that you
know you hold and in individual title
and it&#39;s mine and in the process also we
learned that for our technology to be
relevant we have to answer questions
that matter to the communities so that&#39;s
where we are in this journey and it&#39;s a
journey really to bring the land
information and the power of you know
documenting land to the people what
we&#39;ve been able to do so far is with
everything we&#39;ve learned with all the
concepts we&#39;ve gathered we have a
software tool right now or a prototype
which is able to extract meaningful
digital objects from these hand-drawn
maps so you can see it looks like a bit
of gibberish but those are the mountains
and the different the different
homesteads and so on with this rich
information we can then integrate it
with existing maps to create new maps
new richer maps and new reach
interactions with the community
generated data so I must show this this
last last picture because it&#39;s sort of
it&#39;s very special for me at the end of
the last workshop in a sort of flipping
of roads the women you know called me
out as inside and they come come and I
walked out alike so what&#39;s up is you
know stand here okay so and then they
presented me with with a gift it was a
hand beaded a Massiah bracelet so one of
the women said oh I made this I thought
it would be a nice gift for you and and
that was special so for me it marked
sort of the end of the beginning of this
relationship which I hope will be a
lasting relationship with these very
very amazing people who shared their
time and knowledge with us in Carroll
County to which I&#39;m looking forward to
go back thank you
you
