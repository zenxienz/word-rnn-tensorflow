now I really need your hang on a second
Sarah hello
yep I&#39;ll be right there Sarah I gotta
let you go I forgot AG I have a test in
five minutes okay bye
do you ever feel like you&#39;re trying to
bail it&#39;s school life in one hand family
life in the other hand social life on
top of your head and you&#39;re doing it all
standing on one foot I certainly do
leaving a balanced life can be so tricky
scratch that almost impossible I&#39;ve even
seen people create pie charts such as
this one to better explain how much time
we should be spending studying going to
school having a job hanging out with
family etc although it may seem neat
organized and seamless let&#39;s be honest
the pie charts don&#39;t work some weeks
will require more studying than social
hour sometimes you&#39;re called in to work
on an emergency and you sacrifice family
time even when you do try to live a
balanced life according to the pie chart
life happens right in the next few
minutes I&#39;m going to share with you my
ideas on living a balanced life are you
ready change your focus make time for
you and don&#39;t overcommit all too often
when we think about living a balanced
life we think about what needs to go in
each hand to balance all sides but we
forget about what&#39;s in the middle of the
balance the stand the center the
foundation the equipment that actually
holds that balance together and allows
it to balance we forget about us when we
change our focus to us balancing our
life becomes a lot easier let me better
explain what I&#39;m talking about
take a yardstick for example when you&#39;re
trying to balance a yardstick on your
hand by staring at what&#39;s right in front
of you it can be very tricky but if you
shift your focus balancing the yardstick
becomes a lot easier
focus on you are you tired
burned out overwhelmed is it hard to get
out of bed in the morning do you miss
your family you miss home are you having
a hard time getting assignments done on
time
these are all signs that it&#39;s time to
refuel when we shift our focus to how
we&#39;re actually doing we&#39;re better able
to take care of ourselves and when we
feel good we do good the idea is this
keep your head up focus on you and
balancing your life becomes a lot more
clear when life gets crazy we forget
about us we don&#39;t stop in the middle of
our day and go hmm how am i doing right
now that&#39;s crazy right we don&#39;t have
time for that
but what if I told you this morning I&#39;m
gonna give each one of you one thousand
four hundred and forty dollars but to
balance your life I need just five
dollars back would you do it of course
it&#39;s only five out of 1,440 right but
the bad news is I don&#39;t have that kind
of money sorry but the good news is this
every morning when we wake up we are all
blessed with 1440 minutes in a day and
all it takes is five minutes to balance
your life these five minutes are best
done right away in the morning before
your day even begins even if that means
getting up a little early I promise
you&#39;ll be glad you did it grab a cup of
coffee and take a seat in your favorite
chair during these five minutes avoid
thinking of all the crazy things you
have to do that day the deadlines you
have to meet the people you need to see
and consider just one thing during these
five minutes you
how are you doing how do you feel are
you ready to give this day 100% of you
just be in the moment these five minutes
will begin to open your eyes to how
you&#39;re really doing you&#39;ll start to
notice the mornings you&#39;re extra tired
and what you did the day prior that led
to that exhaustion and then you&#39;ll start
to visualize what you can do today so
you don&#39;t feel that way again tomorrow
these five minutes are not your time for
relaxing and refueling but simply a
daily check-in with yourself so that you
know when it is time to refuel these
five minutes will begin to become the
most important five minutes of your
entire day as they allow you to reflect
on what you&#39;ve done and who you&#39;ve been
and figure out what might work a little
better finally living a balanced life
requires not over committing yourself my
favorite word is yes everyone loves a
yes answer right
my least favorite word is no no seems
like such an awful word why would we
ever use that word let me tell you a
secret about the word no it&#39;s okay to
use it yes I promise it is okay to use
the word no we live in such a wonderful
society where there&#39;s opportunities all
around us opportunities to join clubs
sports volunteer events opportunities to
join social hours go out on the town or
go see a movie yes it is possible to
overcome it some of you may have even
experienced this already it comes in the
form of exhaustion mental hangovers and
feeling lifeless it can even lead to
Netflix binge watching late assignments
and ultimately feeling like a failure
although not all that
flex pin jizz are bad the alter feelings
don&#39;t feel so good sometimes we don&#39;t
even know that we&#39;ve over committed
ourselves until everything just seems to
come crashing down and for those of you
that have experienced that type of
mental emotional and physical crash you
know it&#39;s not a fun place to be but this
can be prevented before any new
commitment take it back to your 5
minutes take time to yourself to
consider how you&#39;re doing how you&#39;re
feeling and what it might be like adding
another item to your life to balance if
you have to make a decision quickly and
you can&#39;t wait to the next morning to
get to your five minutes go find a quiet
place to do it right away and in these
five minutes start to show you that
adding another item to your life just
won&#39;t keep it balanced learn to say no
it&#39;s okay to say no to all the students
out there trying to get your homework
done on time and still have a social
life to the young adults getting used to
a full-time job and trying to find time
for yourself to the parents running your
kids from practice to practice this is
for you change your focus to you take
five minutes every morning to consider
how you&#39;re doing and remember not to
overfill your planner the idea is this
by simply staying in tune with how
you&#39;re doing you can live a healthy
balanced life thank you
