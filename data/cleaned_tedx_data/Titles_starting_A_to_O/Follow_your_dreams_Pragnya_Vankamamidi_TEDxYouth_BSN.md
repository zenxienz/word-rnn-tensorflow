you
you
how many of you enjoy what you do
imagine spending your whole life doing
something and one day realizing that
that is not what you wanted to do that
your dreams are something else entirely
can you imagine sitting in your office
your whole life not wanting to do that
particular job some of you might be
doing that right now to all those you
don&#39;t need to be bored your whole life
you need to have the courage to follow
your dreams we are all different we are
all made to have different jobs
different likes and dislikes but nothing
is stopping you from doing whatever you
want to do or whatever you wanted to be
apart from yourself now I&#39;m a really big
fan of Harry Potter and I just had to
use JK Rowling as an example did you
know that the first Harry Potter book
was rejected 12 times before it was
published all along JK Rowling was
struggling without a job without a home
without any money but she never gave up
her dreams of becoming a writer and look
at Harry Potter books now that is really
inspirational for me this is because I&#39;m
a writer in training however there is
one big problem sometimes parents don&#39;t
always understand our dreams and they
tried to persuade us to do what they
want or what they dream us to become my
mother wants me to become a doctor I
understand her point of view it pays
well you&#39;re helping people get better
it&#39;s a helpful job to have but becoming
a writer is my dream another example I
really like is in a book called the one
and only even it&#39;s about a gorilla
called Yvonne who lives in an enclosure
at the top of a shopping mall he likes
it or at least he thinks he likes it but
late in the book even finds out about
all the other gorillas out in the wild
and then he realizes that his dream is
to be free with the other gorillas
luckily an unlucky fan we are perfectly
able
see others of our own species and see
the possibilities around us that we can
choose from but just like even some of
us are too wrapped up in the details of
our lives to realize the other
possibilities available to use and most
importantly only some of us have the
courage to follow our dreams and do what
we really want these examples make me
realize how important and worthy it is
to persistently keep chasing my dreams
that I should only listen to my heart
and my dreams it&#39;s not alien jobs it&#39;s
also an influence following other
people&#39;s views and opinions if you don&#39;t
want to do something you have to have
the courage to stand up to people that&#39;s
another thing about following your
dreams we have to be strong enough to
stand up for ourselves and to stand out
for what we think is right this doesn&#39;t
mean we will abandon the jobs now and
follow our dreams
in fact our dreams might be something we
can do alongside a job or do in a
different way but following your dreams
is hard we have to work for it it&#39;s not
going to be easy but it&#39;s gonna be worth
it
so that&#39;s why I urge all of us to have
courage and to be brave enough to follow
our dreams
and not someone else&#39;s because what&#39;s
the point in doing something we don&#39;t
want to do if you don&#39;t follow your
dreams then who will
