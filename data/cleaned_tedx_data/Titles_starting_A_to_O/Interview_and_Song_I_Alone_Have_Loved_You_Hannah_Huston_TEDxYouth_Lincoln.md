all right now Hannah was a preschool
teacher here at Lincoln Nebraska before
she auditioned for season 10 of The
Voice and throughout the show Hannah was
work she worked alongside Pharrell
Williams and ultimately finished as the
second runner-up on the show now Hannah
I am completely fangirling about the
fact that I want stage with you right
now I can&#39;t lie can we please get a
picture together absolutely are they
gonna be in it - yes
y&#39;all better smile cheese I&#39;m perfect
don&#39;t look great yeah I will be tweeting
facebooking instagramming snapchatting
and framing that picture so me too all
right Hannah before you perform I have a
few questions for you I have to know
what was it like to be on every
television in Nebraska when you were on
the voice
well Nebraska&#39;s awesome that way in the
fact that I had an immediate fan base
just because I&#39;m from here so that was
awesome and I&#39;m very grateful for all
the continued support that was really
really special to me um I never thought
I&#39;d try out for a show let alone like
the most popular one um but it felt a
little disconnected in the sense where
everyone was kind of watching TV and
there was a brief segment on my life
that was really fun and interesting and
I was in LA and I was filming it also
didn&#39;t really seem glitz and glam to me
I was working pretty hard so there was
kind of this weird superstar expectation
that I didn&#39;t really connect with I&#39;m
the Nebraska preschool teacher you know
and never thought I would do something
like that but it ended up being really
fun it was a really neat experience
that&#39;s awesome and what was it that you
think that you learned most about that
entire experience again I never thought
I would do something like that and I
think in my mind I was thinking well I&#39;m
not interesting enough
or I&#39;m to normal
there&#39;s nothing they&#39;re gonna get out of
me being on a television show you know
again just from Nebraska I teach and I
like to sing too but as I thought about
that more and more as I teach preschool
kids I would want them to know that
their life and the mundane or the boring
it&#39;s actually very interesting and
you&#39;re very special and everyone&#39;s story
it matters and you a purpose so that was
something that I kind of had to like
preach to myself and yeah you never know
you can make it to the end of a
television show like something like that
so that&#39;s an awesome story and besides
your obvious successes what was the most
exciting moment for you on the voice
yeah there were a lot of a lot of things
unexpected surprises I&#39;m getting voted
on week after week and then you got to
perform on really really cool stages and
you get aware of really high heels um
that was hard um but I would say the
most special thing to me about that
whole entire experience in the journey
that it was was I made so many new
friendships and then where I come from I
had a lot of friends and family back
home cheering for me staying by my side
even though I was miles away it just
felt more special getting to know
Pharrell was a really neat experience I
think at the end of the day
relationships really matter and that one
was a really special one to me and
hearing stories of just people watching
on Monday and Tuesday nights it was a
lot of TV a lot of time together and I
just that&#39;s really special to me because
I think mountaintop experiences can
happen to you in moments but they really
don&#39;t mean as much when you don&#39;t have
people to share it with so I just my
encouragement to us and Lincoln
especially is just to embrace our
community start conversations just
really get to know people because that&#39;s
what I took to LA and it was just the
most special thing to
that&#39;s awesome yeah I&#39;m sure that there
were a lot of really incredible
experiences being on that show but why
do you think was the most challenging
moment for you on the voice that with
everything that you went through that
throughout the whole entire experience
besides really high heels and walking
down stairs hard I would say when you go
on television you automatically become a
public person and then what kind of
seems to happen is and we all do it
people were given the opportunity to
make assumptions opinions about who I
was and some of those are really good
and some of those were kind of hurtful
someone again who gets a brief segment
on your life on national television gets
all sorts of permission to kind of like
you or not and there was one week on the
show where I sang a song and some people
did not really like it and I was on
YouTube and I was reading comments and
just some really hurtful hurtful
comments and I kind of had to understand
that people just aren&#39;t gonna like you
there&#39;s and we do it too everyone does
it everyone&#39;s guilty of it but it was
really motivation to me like okay well I
like me I like Who I am
I like my thanks under my friends like
who I am and my family loves me like
there&#39;s you I kind of had to remember
like these are the people who actually
know me and so you kind of have to fight
those things and it happens to everyone
people make predictions about you
assumptions about you and you have to
just be like okay I like Who I am so I
kind of had to again preach to myself
all of that because it was really hard
but I think the takeaway for me and for
all of us is there are lots of
opportunities to say things and then
there&#39;s a lot of opportunities to not
say something and so my challenge to all
of us is to just be mindful and be
thoughtful about the things we say about
other people and or write on the
Internet
and I am yeah I&#39;m better for it I&#39;m
stronger because of those comments
um but yeah that would be the most
challenging one being on that show
actually you&#39;ve written an original song
that you&#39;ll be performing for us today
what is the message from that song that
you would like the audience to take away
from today so stay with me here but
called I alone have loved you and it&#39;s
on iTunes you can go get it and yeah I
alone have loved you I wrote it a long
time ago with my friend crystal Davey
recorded it recently in Georgia with my
good friend Nate Washburn it&#39;s been with
me for a long time this song but anyways
crystal and I were looking online and we
saw this contest and we were like okay
let&#39;s write a song this is kind of when
I first started writing and started
singing a public and all this stuff it&#39;s
kind of a crazy story but we were
inspired by this painting and it&#39;s
called Christina&#39;s world by Andrew Wyeth
and it&#39;s currently in New York at the
MoMA at the Museum of Modern Art anyways
this painting is beautiful and it
depicts a girl who is unable to walk and
she crawls but she can crawl and she
crawls to this hill and it looks over
this field and there&#39;s this house and so
anyways we&#39;re kind of looking at this
painting and just kind of crafting a
story about it and we kind of came up
with this idea that there&#39;s this guy and
he loves Christina and doesn&#39;t love her
based on her abilities or her
disabilities rather but he loves her for
who she is so it&#39;s the story of like
unconditional love and I think if the
world did this a little more so we&#39;d be
a better place but anyhow this guy&#39;s
this is again totally our narrative but
this guy sneaks into the moment like
every night and he just looks at her and
he just loves her but he&#39;s too nervous
if she would turn around she would he
thinks she would like think he&#39;s creepy
or something but it&#39;s really just the
story of this unconditional 11 we don&#39;t
love people because of their gifts or
their talents or anything like that it&#39;s
just because of who they are so anyways
it&#39;s been a long time this
song was we did a video of it and
submitted it to this contest and then
later that year I the voice basically
found it and said hey you want to come
audition and then hearing him if she saw
me he frozen not fear I could have lost
it
[Music]
it&#39;s like a brushstroke cave draws me to
this but to our midnight on and I know
