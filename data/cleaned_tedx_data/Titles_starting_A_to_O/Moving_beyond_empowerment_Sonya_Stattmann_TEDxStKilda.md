so my mom was the kindest most loving
and generous woman she literally had
this laugh that could fill the room now
as a teenager I wanted to disown her and
her laugh but I would do anything to
hear it now my mom had the most amazing
capacity for joy but even as a child I
could feel that she carried around a lot
of pain
you see she grew up in a very critical
household with two alcoholic parents you
have to imagine she lived in the
southern belle part of the u.s. so
status and appearance was really
important when she was 20 she was
engaged to be married and she got
pregnant right before the wedding and
instead of allowing the marriage to go
through they split up the couple they
ship my mom across the country to have a
baby on her own and give it up for
adoption her siblings didn&#39;t even know
this had happened eventually my mom
married my dad and he left her not once
but twice and she was forced to raise
two kids on her own when I was in high
school my mom made a horrible mistake at
work and very abruptly she ended up in
jail for four months which turned our
whole family upside down and probably
the most challenging experience my mom
had was she met a man that promised her
the world and she ended up getting lost
in Pakistan for more than two years
during that time we didn&#39;t know if she
was alive or dead and she suffered a
tremendous amount of abuse and barely
made it out of the country alive these
experiences were an important part of my
mom&#39;s story
instead of seeing them as a testament to
her strength she saw them as a source of
shame she looked at these experiences as
a series of failures and because of that
she stopped trusting herself and she
spent a lot of her time giving her power
over to others now the way that my mom
saw herself is not the way that I saw
her I saw her as a fierce survivor i
internalized her strength and i knew
that i could overcome and survive
anything and I did I survived my parents
divorce at seven and being one of the
primary caregivers for my sister at the
age of nine I survived being raped by
one of my best friends at the age of 15
I survived a high school full of guns
and drugs and violence I survived my
idiot teenage years which seriously was
a miracle in and of itself I survived my
hurt my first husband&#39;s drug addiction
and literally lost everything and
because of that I overcame bankruptcy
divorce and the failure of my first
business and probably one of the
greatest things I overcame was being a
single parent and running two businesses
at the same time you see unlike my mom I
never saw these experiences as a source
of shame I saw them as a source of power
I learned to trust myself more not less
because I&#39;m the one that had gotten
through them and what I discovered is
that real empowerment is choosing to
believe and trust in ourselves it&#39;s
knowing that we are the only ones that
have the power to change our fate so I&#39;m
a success strategist for women in
business and for the last two decades
I&#39;ve been using the business
rina to help women empower themselves
and to change their fate I&#39;ve worked
with thousands of women over that time
and what I&#39;ve learned is that whether in
the business or life arena the biggest
opponent we as women face is ourselves
so I won&#39;t share with you thousands of
stories tonight because we would be here
literally all night I just really want
to share with you one one of my bravest
and most courageous clients when I met
Sara she was 32 years old she was a
consultant and a speaker and she&#39;d been
in business for about six years and she
just really felt like she was running in
place she kept putting more and more
energy into her business but she wasn&#39;t
getting any farther she tried all the
hype you know hashtag living the dream
she bought the online programs that
promised freedom she&#39;d hire the
expensive mentors
she tried all the latest greatest
marketing techniques
she tried passive income and
partnerships she&#39;d even hired an entire
team to help her scale her business but
instead of feeling like she was living
the dream she really just felt like she
was trapped in a nightmare she was
constantly anxious overworked and
exhausted her friends and family were
fed up because she was always working
nights and weekends
she felt like she was being crushed
under a weight of debt and she really
just fell out of control so this is when
she met me and at the time she didn&#39;t
know it but she was about to get a lot
more than she bargained for in a
business coach you see I can look at
someone&#39;s business and I can tell you
what they&#39;re struggling with in
themselves it&#39;s actually why I love
working with women in business because a
business reflects to us where we give up
our power where we struggle with our
value and where we distrust ourselves
so Sara and I started digging into her
business because I wanted to understand
you know how she was operating it what
was working and not working and where
she was losing income and impact and we
discovered some really interesting
patterns Sara would make a decision her
business big or small and almost
immediately doubt herself and then she
let someone else make the decision for
her she struggled with setting
boundaries so her clients and employees
were walking all over her and she
constantly compared herself to others
and to the media hype and felt like she
was never accomplishing enough I mean
she&#39;d been in business six years and she
wasn&#39;t making six figures she wasn&#39;t
sitting on the beach with passive income
and she certainly didn&#39;t feel free so
together sara and i piece by piece took
back the reins of her business in life
she had to change the way she saw
herself and her business she had to take
back leadership from her clients and
employees and that&#39;s no easy task she
had to take back control of her time but
probably what we spent the most time on
was working with her learning to trust
and believe in herself again you see
Sara needed to know that her decisions
her wisdom and her guidance were
ultimately the only ones that matter not
mine not some other expert and
definitely not some secret to success
she hadn&#39;t figured out yet she needed to
know what it felt like to stand in her
power she needed to know that she was
the one that had to determine her fate
so as you can imagine this was not an
overnight process and oftentimes it was
one step forward and two steps back and
sometimes Sara was seduced by the idea
of a quick win and she would try to
shortcut the process
but instead of getting farther along it
actually veered her completely off track
because see Sarah needed to build skills
and skill building takes time and the
most important skill that Sarah needed
to build was learning to believe and
trust in herself again so one of the
battles that Sarah and I often
encountered was around all the social
media hype and marketing messages is
about how easy it is to succeed in
business how easy it is to find freedom
you know hashtag living the dream
hashtag empowerment hashtag 10k in ten
days these social media messages and
marketing they sabotage women&#39;s success
they reinforce for Sarah that she was a
failure because she tried it all and
still hadn&#39;t succeeded they distracted
her from the real work which is the
internal work and that&#39;s the hard work
and they constantly had her putting her
hope and belief in something outside
herself
so eventually Sarah she stopped
listening to the hype and she stopped
going for quick wins and yes her
business radically transformed but when
she talks about her work with me she
doesn&#39;t talk about her business she
talks about her freedom she talks about
how empowered she feels in her life
her relationships and yes her business
too she talks about how much she loves
her life in her work now and she talks
about how finally she believes and
trusts in herself
you see that is the greatest part to
sarah&#39;s success story I&#39;ve been in the
trenches with women for a long time and
Sarah and my mom stories are just two of
thousands I&#39;ve had the honor to be a
part of I&#39;m an advocate
for shifting the systems and the
attitudes in the world that are
disempowering women but what we first
have to address is what we are doing to
ourselves when we distrust ourselves we
dis empower ourselves when we look at
our struggles and failures as weakness
we deny our strength when we try to
shortcut the path to empowerment we lose
the skills that guarantee our success
and when we put our hope in false
messages of success and we compare
ourselves to others we deny our greatest
potential you see I believe it&#39;s time
for us to change our fate we have to be
willing to move beyond hashtag
empowerment and the surface ideas of
living the dream and go deeper the best
way to continue the fight for women&#39;s
empowerment in the world is to empower
ourselves first thank you
