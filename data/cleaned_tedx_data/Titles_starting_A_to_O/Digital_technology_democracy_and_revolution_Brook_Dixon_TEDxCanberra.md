digital technology democracy revolution
digital revolutionizes democracy digital
democratizes revolution and here&#39;s my
big line you can tweet this one if you
want Digital of the people by the people
and for the people who said it sense of
me doesn&#39;t it resonates I said it I said
it right here right now on the stage of
course I&#39;m paraphrasing Abraham Lincoln
his 1863 Gettysburg Address where he
says that this nation shall have a new
birth of freedom and that government of
the people by the people and for the
people shall not perish from this earth
why then why do I conflate government in
digital why do I say digital of the
people by the people and for the people
I say this because last year when I
voted in the local election I realized
that the sum total of my democratic
expression had been one pay per vote in
four years
one paper vote in four years in the
middle of a digital revolution and it
seems to me that this revolution offers
us a new birth of freedom for our
democracy
and I am certain that one paper vote
every four years does not a modern
democracy make in fact it does not an
ancient democracy make two and a half
thousand years ago when democracy was
first conceived in ancient Greece in
eleven it was practiced as more
participatory deliberative and most
important regular embedded think of the
ancient Athenians all 6,000 citizens
would gather together regularly to
discuss to debate and decide matters of
state and here we are today another
citizen assembly we&#39;re here to be
inspired we want to imagine our future
we want to discuss and debate but we
have no power to decide not here not
today we have our one paper vote every
four years the ancient Greeks so many
years ago and still so far ahead of us
in this respect of course in this
respect
think what the ancient Greeks bestowed
on its democracy this great word more
than that our philosophy an idea a way
of life our belief that every citizen
has both the right and the obligation to
participate in society and democratic
decision-making let&#39;s look at the word
democracy demos the people Kratos power
people power power to the people and we
live in a democracy don&#39;t we don&#39;t we we
say we do we believe we do we have the
forms and fashions of democracy but if
you review our democracy against the
standard of its which it was originally
conceived I say we&#39;ve regressed we
progressed in two critical ways first
what we demand of democracy second in
what democracy demands of us and I say
to you my message today is that we must
demand more of our democracy we must
demand that it progresses it evolves it
modernizes it gives us more it gives
more power to the people and we must
demand more of ourselves for if we don&#39;t
demand more change none will come if not
us then who if not us then who you might
ask yourself will Brooke why should our
democracy change we have a system of
government that works a system of
government that has served as well a
system of government based on hundreds
of years of tradition Westminster indeed
we vote we have rights we&#39;re not an
autocracy why should we change if only
things were so simple if only we could
go on as we are now but the price of
freedom is eternal vigilance and just as
times change just as culture changes
just as our society changes and
technology changes so too should our
democracy you&#39;ve all felt this need and
necessity both personally and the grow
make greater momentum that is pushing
this forward both nationally and
internationally at the moment you&#39;ve
failed it you&#39;ve failed it when you see
decisions of local and national
importance influenced more by the
powerful than the people by the few
rather than many
you&#39;ve felt it when our elected
representatives play party politics for
years upon years seemingly oblivious to
the will of the people on important
issues important issues of basic human
rights and recognition of international
conflict indeed of fundamental human
existence you&#39;ve felt the need for
change as well when you feel that
distance and disconnection from national
decision-making
that leaves us feeling disregarded and
excluded and without a voice and the
price of not changing is very grim the
price of not modernizing our democracy
is grim study after study tells us that
when people feel excluded from
decision-making when they feel
disregarded when they feel their voice
is not being heard then the rise of
regionalism insular ISM and other such
isms don&#39;t evitable and when they
finally can give voice in anger and
frustration to their views one vote
every four years then surprising and
destructive may be the outcomes we only
have to look around the world over the
last 18 months to see that we only have
to look around and see that so if we
believe we believe that our democracies
have changed what then can we do I&#39;m
going to give you three things three
things number one believe that our
democracy can and should change it&#39;s a
tough one we tend to see this as a fixed
point around which all our democratic
decision-making revolves I&#39;m going to
illustrate this by reference to Thomas
Jefferson here&#39;s a man who basically
built a democracy he wrote the
Declaration of Independence of United
States he was instrumental in framing
their constitution and he saw quite
clearly in those early days that many
people looked at that Constitution with
st. demonise reverence and deemed it
like the Ark of the Covenant too sacred
to be touched
but he also believed he saw quite
clearly in fact and he wrote that just
as times change just as culture changes
just as science changes as we become
more enlightened so too must our laws
and our government and our institutions
change also so want you to open your
mind to the belief that our democracy
must evolve and change open your mind
also also open your mind to the forces
that are quite happy with the status quo
the forces that understand believers of
power as it stands that are quite happy
to wield greater influence than
one-person one-vote the forces that are
blocked and breaks democratic reform and
evolution for centuries and millennia
big business lobbyists political parties
the wealthy the social elite
traditionalists all these that are still
in the way of democratic reform think
how many centuries that talk or struggle
for all classes to get the vote for
women for the oppressed and what do we
have after centuries of struggle what do
we have we have one pay per vote every
four years do you want more from your
democracy I do I want more the second
thing you can do is to be a digital
democracy Digital of the people by the
people and for the people what do I mean
by this I mean that we should harness
the momentum of the digital revolution
to modernize our democracy quite simply
Digital is a game changer for democracy
it Able&#39;s us to deal with one of the
greatest challenges of democracy the
challenge of coordination can you
imagine what it was like to coordinate
six thousand Athenians all together in
decision-making how much more complex is
it to coordinate millions how much more
complex is it to coordinate millions and
it&#39;s this complexity of coordination
that has given us a new form of
democracy which is an indirect democracy
or a representation rather than direct
by the people that proximity for the
people the demos and where does that
leave us we could have so much more we
could have so much more than that
digital throws it out the window throws
the arguments of indirect democracy
representation out the window imagine
the ancient Greeks many of them could
not attend the assembly because they
were too busy working on their farms
can you imagine what they would do with
digital technology one hand on the plow
plowing the field other hand mobile
phone voting just checking out what
those ancient Persians are up to got to
keep an eye on them in other words
they&#39;d be doing more than we&#39;re doing
more than we&#39;re doing and we can have so
much more we can have so much more we
can have crowd-sourced legislation we
can have web-based community budgeting
we can have online voting
hold your horses I hear you say online
voting you&#39;re trying to take away our
democracy sausage no no we say no to
that I&#39;m not trying to take away you
democracy sausage I want you to
celebrate and practice democracy more
often and have that sausage more often
let&#39;s save that democracy sausage a
couple of times a year at least and
while you might miss while you might
miss the cardboard ballot box and a
piece of paper that goes in it I know no
one will miss a postal plebiscite are we
serious we are in the middle of a
digital democracy a digital revolution
and we&#39;re asking people to be surveyed
by post this isn&#39;t just things I&#39;m
making up this is real this is happening
around the world when I traveled around
the world on a Churchill fellowship last
year I saw great things in smart and
digital cities the greatest of all was
Digital democracy happening in real time
and you can google this I want you to go
home and check out hashtag digital
democracy and go and talk about Civic
technology two examples in Brazil they
created an online portal a democracy er
which allows people to participate in
national parliamentary debate and had
great success including
including sourcing vast portions by
crowdsourcing of legislation and in
Seoul where they say the citizen is the
mayor they understand democracy they put
the citizen first they&#39;ve created a
suite of digital tools so that citizens
can practice and participate and
co-create their city in its future and
voting on their mobile phones mobile
voting they push out real-time issues
for the citizens to vote on to provide
ideas on and even to propose their own
ideas for citizens to vote on imagine if
we here today if we here today had our
democracy Australia app what issues
we&#39;ll be voting on how would we be
holding our representatives to account
what matters would we be putting forward
our views for public debate just imagine
the third thing we can do is to be
active activist citizens asking not what
our democracy can do for us but what we
can do for our democracy the greatest
strength of democracy has always been an
active citizenry just as just as
complacency has always made its Achilles
heel we must be active we must not be
content to be told but the government is
too complex to the people not content to
be so dismayed by what&#39;s happening
political spheres that we withdraw from
democracy and turned our back on it we
must be active and digital technology
makes it so much easier and we can start
right here today we could tweet our
politicians but I believe they ignore
them too busy composing their own I
understand so when you find two minutes
perhaps in a little break today you
might wish to write them off a quick
letter an email if you will which I
believe they have to respond to and you
might say do you remember I believe in
democracy
I believe our democracy should evolve as
times and science and culture changes I
would like to have a greater role in our
democracy I believe that technology can
play a part in its evolution I would
appreciate your advice on your policies
to advance our democracy fair your
sincerely citizen TEDx hashtag digital
democracy
and there you have it momentum we can
all provide momentum to the positive
progress of our democracy whether people
have a greater role power to the people
Digital democracy digital of the people
by the people and for the people
[Applause]
