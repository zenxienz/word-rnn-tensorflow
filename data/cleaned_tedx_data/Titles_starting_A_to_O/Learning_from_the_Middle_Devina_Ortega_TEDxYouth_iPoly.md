hello everyone i&#39;m davina ortega a
senior here at AI poly high school I am
also someone with a lot of ambition and
someone with a lot of drive and
determination I aspire to be a Supreme
Court justice one day I want to mentor
young girls that are walking in my
footsteps being a middle class citizen
but in order to achieve my goals in
order to achieve my goals I have to
follow the rules of society meaning a
lot of people think success is defined
by wealth and riches but that&#39;s not true
it&#39;s a common mistake to think that life
is built off of success and it&#39;s built
off of wealth and riches because there&#39;s
been a path for humans and for the
citizens to follow you be success by
being rich you&#39;d be success by being
popular you be you have success by
basically just being everyone&#39;s
know-it-all but I am here to show you
three different keys that prove
otherwise three different keys that show
that being a middle class citizen or
lower like a lower class citizen you can
still be successful and you don&#39;t need
riches or wealth so for me I have a lot
of goals like I said but in order for my
goals to be met I have to have a high
SAT score to go to college at USC or
need to pay expenses for an SAT prep
course that are extremely expensive and
I need to have tuition and all of these
things that kind of are factors that
push people down from reaching their
success but since success is a
subjective and you define your own
success I define my own success there&#39;s
no there&#39;s no limit as to where we can
go in our own life my definition of
success is waking up and inspiring
people waking up and living my life to
God&#39;s will waking up and being able to
show
other people that are looking up to me
or if they walk in they see me that this
girl has come from the past this girl
doesn&#39;t need to be rich does it need to
be wealthy too in order to make a
difference in the world so let&#39;s look at
these three quotes neck slide okay they
didn&#39;t survive by eating each other they
survive by being resourceful and no this
isn&#39;t a quote from The Hunger Games
so another quote is opportunity doesn&#39;t
knock it presents itself when you beat
down the door and the last quote is if
you want to go fast go alone if you want
to go far go with others so next slide
please
each one of these quotes represents
something they all have an overlaying
theme that defines what the quote itself
is so the first quote that I read is
about enterprising the second quote that
I read was about believing and the third
quote I read is about networking so next
slide please
enterprising the definition of
enterprising is to be resourceful and
that could be from a variety of things
resources doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be
the soil on the ground or the water in
the sky or anything like that it doesn&#39;t
necessarily have to be scientific but
for example Bill Gates he was
resourceful he was a nerd in a garage he
woke up rolled out of bed morning breath
and all and studied and he worked and he
was in his garage trying to create
something and he did he became a nerd to
a billionaire and he did that by being
an enterprise er and he found his
resources in his garage and he worked
with people around him another example
is King David from the Bible and it&#39;s
really ancient but it&#39;s true and it&#39;s
just something that&#39;s an example that we
never really consider so he was a
shepherd
well woke up just like Hook eats wood
rolled out of bed and he tended his
sheep but what he also did is he became
a
so he had all of these lower-class
middle class like resources with him but
he obtained them and became a king he
was really good at military strategies
he was smart he learned how to speak in
front of people he used his inner
resources to become successful to his
own self next slide please
networking so the definition of
networking is to be able to interact
with people and you are just talking to
a person seeing what you can offer for
them what they can offer for you you&#39;re
getting to know somebody and you&#39;re
looking at your surroundings and saying
hey I know this person is in this area
you don&#39;t need money to go and talk to
them you&#39;re not paying for their
conversation with you you just open your
possibilities up and you look around and
even if you don&#39;t think that they have
anything to offer to you you share your
ideas you&#39;re being resourceful within
yourself and you&#39;re showing that you can
go out and talk to people and there&#39;s no
problem with that and that people are
there for you to listen and you&#39;re there
for them to listen and you&#39;re just
networking and making connections and
building relationships that can last a
lifetime and I know stories from people
that have been in middle school and in
high school in college and now they&#39;re
in jobs and they still have those
connections from those same people that
they met when they&#39;re in elementary
school it&#39;s basically just keeping that
connection with people building
relationships and that doesn&#39;t require
money you can be a middle class and
lower class citizen and you can have all
of these connections especially with
social media these days there&#39;s so much
networking going around that you don&#39;t
need to have any like finances to talk
to someone you just use your own your
body your voice and you can create
success by your definition that way next
slide please
the third key is believing believing in
yourself
so the definition of believing is to
have faith or confidence and the
existence of what it&#39;s worth so
basically you&#39;re believing in something
nobody else believes what you believe
except you you believe in your goals you
can believe in yourself you can believe
in your dreams and so by that finding
resources and you&#39;re in your own self
you can believe in your own self
your own morals your own values you know
one has to tell you that that&#39;s all
yourself you can&#39;t go out in the world
and expect to be confident if you&#39;re not
confident in yourself you have to know
that I know what I want I know my goals
and my dreams and I know how to get
there and I know that because you&#39;re
believing in yourself another thing is
seeing opportunities before it happens
to be proactive and to have an active
mind and so you&#39;re walking to school
you&#39;re going to work you&#39;re going to
church you&#39;re going to a community event
wherever you&#39;re going you&#39;re thinking I
believe in myself I have confidence
because you never know what people are
thinking about you you never know if
they&#39;re having a negative connotation to
you you don&#39;t know if they&#39;re looking at
you positive but if you have confidence
you believe in yourself you can be
successful in your own goals and your
own dreams next slide so everybody got a
program as they walk through the door so
can you please take out your program in
the back of the program there should be
a section for notes get out a pen or a
pencil in your purse or your wallet or
whatever you have it and if you don&#39;t
there&#39;s um there should be passing out
pens if you don&#39;t so raise your hand if
you don&#39;t have a pen or a pencil so one
over here went in the back and one in
the front just wait a second okay so for
those of you that do have your pens so
on the pieces of lines write three goals
that you have I&#39;ll give you like about a
minute to write three goals that you
have it can be in any aspect of your
life it can be as small or as big as you
would like so just write three goals I&#39;m
having you write goals because it&#39;s been
statistically proven that when you write
your goals out you actually achieve them
like the Huffington Post&#39;s that 80% of
people that write their goals down
actually achieve their goals because you
can think about it but there&#39;s a million
things in the world that your brain is
constantly thinking that if you don&#39;t
write it down and reference it it&#39;s less
likely to be obtainable so I&#39;m asking
you guys to write three goals down
whatever or your dreams or anything
now that you&#39;ve written it down or
writing it down next slide please
I want to show you guys that your dreams
and your goals that you just wrote down
on that piece of paper
they&#39;re obtainable with these three
things enterprising being your own
enterprise er believing in yourself and
networking you have those three things
they&#39;re free middle-class citizens
lower-class citizens you can become
successful like Steve Jobs and Steve
Wozniak they were working together and
they created Apple and they&#39;re still
imparting into people&#39;s lives and it&#39;s
still a really rich and expensive
company but they didn&#39;t have a whole lot
of resources to start off with and so
they wrote their dreams down and there
goes sound they made it happen
they networked with a lot of people they
believed in themselves and most of all
they were their own entrepreneur their
own enterprise ur so my advice for you
today is to go out be your own
entrepreneur and to use these three
things use these three keys in your life
and you&#39;ll see that your dreams will
become more obtainable to you so thank
you for listening
[Applause]
