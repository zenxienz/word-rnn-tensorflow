today I like to talk with you about the
value of art and I don&#39;t mean the value
of art in emotional sense I don&#39;t mean
the value of art in a financial way but
what I do mean is the value of art in
our daily life the place of art in
society and its importance of that now
I&#39;m going to give you a quote think
about that
because this is the key note of my own
speech but I think is that art gives the
best most creative answer to its time
spirit it answers to the questions of
its time which is in fact natural
because an artist it&#39;s the same person
as you and me it&#39;s a father or a mother
it&#39;s your neighbor it says it reacts to
threats and impulses the same as we do
reading the same newspapers looking at
the same television programs the only
difference is that he or she translates
these emotions these feelings into a
creative way is our the only one no
artists of course not the only one there
are so many things especially in
creative industry that answers to its
time questions but there is a difference
for instance let me put it this way
after 9/11 our focus went to the Middle
East a little bit of strange happening
that it&#39;s that it&#39;s happened that way
but it did it really did before that the
Middle East was not really in our
thoughts in the Western world but after
that then in our houses came in the
aluminium place with calligraphy the
gloss is where we drink tea out we were
eating all of a sudden from tagines we
are eating still medicines
etc lovely my children are smoking
sometimes water pipe did they do this 15
years ago I don&#39;t think so and of course
there came in the art from the Middle
East because these images we knew
already that there was planted seed in
our brains so we could recognize it so
it was in fashion and it came in now the
difference is the glasses will fall down
the fashion we&#39;re wearing which is of
course the same thing the outing of this
time spirit those jeans whatever you are
wearing will be out of season next CZ
will throw it away but the art remains
so the art is more sustainable you make
your choices then in there in a
different way and that is also got to do
something with the art itself artists
gives an answer to its time spirit but
more profound it is more hidden the
message is more hidden in a work of art
then in something that is less
sustainable if you can take the message
out of the artwork if you can feel the
energy that gives the message in the
artwork it will give you a reward a
greater reward because then you can and
all of a sudden of connection and then
it&#39;s what I mean it&#39;s not that you only
look to one image but you see the art as
a whole like all those different kind of
genes you see then you know what is in
fashion now look at the art not only in
one particular way not one image because
you like it but go and see and look if
you can find a certain energy in
everything there is in art then you find
a different way now if we if it&#39;s indeed
an answer to its time spirit that means
that artists who are known in history
are also being a part of this history so
then if you&#39;re looking to an older
banking for instance you should be aware
of the time spirit at the moment because
otherwise you don&#39;t really see the work
then it doesn&#39;t give you the energy it
should give you let&#39;s do an example
now laundry and we all know Mondrian
let&#39;s place it in its time we are after
World War one and it was chaos of course
and everybody was looking for new ways
in life to have a new society more
bright less emotional being away from
tradition go into a modern world with
whole new way of living we call it the
start of modernism and it was a
university universal form language the
people and the artists were looking for
and Mondrian was one of the major
artists who gave at that time the most
creative the most daring answer to the
question of its time and that is the
reason why he is famous all over the
world but then if he had made that could
be maybe other people did already ten
years before that we would never have
heard of him because it wasn&#39;t then and
there the right moment then he wouldn&#39;t
have given the right answer to its time
spirit now if that&#39;s the case then
another value comes in and that&#39;s the
one we called quality quality can be
measured in two failures one is what you
like but you like best and that is
always good let nobody take that away
from you your individual taste is
something that is very clear very real
but it&#39;s an emotional value and I cannot
measure their debt so what I can do is
the absolute
we value of quality and that is in my
opinion those works and those artists
who were capable of getting the time
spirit at the right moment at the right
place on the right time in the best way
the most daring way that munjin do this
all the time but I don&#39;t think so I mean
a lovely picture of course the painting
with the cows but it didn&#39;t answer to
its time spirit so there we have quality
and we have less quality and that of
course counts for every artist now we go
to another time we go to another example
after purple - there was again chaos
chaos everywhere emotional chaos
political chaos social chaos financial
chaos but of course in due time it went
over and if we are in the end by the end
of the 50s a totally new society came in
new inventions were made inventions that
would make our lives easier
vacuum cleaner tape-recorder life became
totally different with the invention of
television the invention of radio the
invention of the tape recorder are
already said so but we went to the moon
life became even bigger earth became
bigger so that&#39;s the time but
immediately a new answer to the time
spirit should be in and there was this
young young bright artist Andy Warhol we
said I&#39;m going to to to fill in the gap
between art and society and I will call
it popular art in short pop art
and what he did is he took out icons and
very very well-known items out of
society and put it in a museum put it in
art so that you were confronted with the
way that life was made at that moment
because it was the start of the
consumption society the consumption
society as we know it now he even made
his works if he duplicated his works in
the factory well art and a factory was
that possible yes it was possible
because it was a consumers society and
that exactly was the answer to it
so again we&#39;re talking about somebody
who made the very best brights answer to
its time spirit next question is of
course where are we now where are we now
well of course we know about the
refugees we know about being attacked on
our own front beyond our own frontiers
we have all these threats coming our way
but we also have nature calling to us
health calling to us and in what time in
what periods in history was it exactly
the same well if we think about that I&#39;m
immediately thinking about 60s and that
is what&#39;s actually going on right now at
the 60s we had flower power at the 60s
we had all these these riots against war
and the use of chemical weapons in
Vietnam war for instance now then we had
hippies now we call them hipsters that
is a coincidence isn&#39;t there then we
were jeans with those whites endings of
of the the trousers well very much
affection don&#39;t you think so so
everything is going to this period we
even have the songs to literature
everything the movies is right in
fashion right now so what we did how
does the art
that is the two years ago for an example
there was the Venice Biennial
a very important art event in the world
and we send out for our country the
Netherlands an 86 year old artist named
Lee Herman the face and he was one of
the founders in the 60s of the zero
movement the European minimal art he is
about nature all about nature so did he
fit in the time spirit of now yes he did
and it is so clearly to see that that
was the right answer and not even we
sent out an 86 year old artist to this
event France the American did Australia
did so that is the proof but we are
already in this period for some years so
we are heading for something totally new
and with the coming youth looking over
our shoulders then we can see a totally
new thing coming up I think that in this
new era that art the creative thinking
will be high end and since art is the
best most daring way art will be used in
different combinations so there is art
and fashion art and design maybe even
art and food we already know that but
for for now I think that new
combinations will be in like art and
technical art and bio but biological
things art and science but the technical
aspects in combination with art will be
the next thing and it&#39;s already
happening as we saw in in the exposition
of last year in a stealth museum with
robots of Turin Wilson amazing well
haven&#39;t even said that please note that
I&#39;m not a trained watcher at all I&#39;m an
art lover that&#39;s something else
through art I&#39;m far more aware of the
effects of my time
the facts were I really living the
thoughts of where we going to all
through that and I really hope that you
feel the same as I do because death for
me is the value of art thank you
