these are the directory routes of visa
that would be over a year ago and it&#39;s
estimated that any point during the
construction you&#39;re up to 40,000 people
involved no matter this paper will
probably slice the beans in terrible
conditions in the middle of ISM and
today it&#39;s hard for us to imagine the
types of lives that these people would
have had to enjoy this is my grandfather
there are many others who came here
looking for work and looking to build a
better life for him and his family he
had very little education and because of
this young word that he would find was
as a manual laborer living any chance
working in road games with hundreds of
people up these people yet they lived in
some pretty hot conditions as well as my
MA now maybe these conditions went as
far as the people had to build the
pyramids in the business but they were
higher than the less compared to these
men building the Great Ocean Road in the
1920s construction and Civil Works has
changed enormously for those of you who
triggered into video on the freeway
twisting you&#39;ll notice that this lives
always happening to replace really
dangerous intersection and to improve
traffic flow it&#39;s a it&#39;s a massive civil
works project is taking over 24 months
and it&#39;s still going to take many months
to complete
compared to the time of the pyramids
where there were thousands of people
there&#39;s not even time to pay if you look
at this works like today this probably
10 or 20 days
Machinery all that dangerous
back-breaking hard manual work has been
replaced it&#39;s been replaced by a couple
of bulldozers and some excavators we can
throw a lot of parallels between what&#39;s
happening in the construction and Civil
Works industry over the last four
millennia and what&#39;s happening today
bidding tonight society we&#39;re living in
a different era will be needed and there
are provide official intelligence and
instead of replacing artificial
intelligence is replacing the mundane is
electric tasks we have to undertake
today the chocolate is that for us to
understand how artificial intelligence
will impact their day-to-day professions
and what opportunities may come out of
it now if you think that artificial
intelligence is something that is
something in the future it&#39;s not it&#39;s
here today and you&#39;ve been using it
probably on a daily basis if you&#39;ve used
a spell check feature in your word
processing software or if you&#39;ve gotten
a GPS device to put me in a destination
and it&#39;s work at the shortest route to
where you go you use they are every time
you use a web browser and some little as
pop-up and I&#39;m telling you what I think
you would buy you these artificial
intelligence and probably most
impressive of all if you use cereal or
Tanner or Google assistant on your smart
phone is probably this a lot but these
are all examples of just the beginning
of what I can do and in the very near
future it&#39;s very difficult to think of
any profession at all that won&#39;t be
highly impacted by artificial
intelligence there are some industries
that are obvious targets for being
highly impacted by artificial
intelligence and automation and their
example of civil works and instruction
in the coming years it&#39;s estimated that
86% of all these work roles will be
replaced in construction over the next
15 years if you&#39;re working as a
receptionist in food preparation in
hospitality ended up to 86 percent of 84
percent of these jobs also might be
replaced by automation and artificial
intelligence even in highly technical
professional services the producer
traditionally required many many years
of tertiary education will also be
radically changed by the official
intelligence of the coming years in my
fields of IT and technology exists may
be that 45% of these roles that my staff
are doing today may be replaced by
efficient touches let&#39;s break the means
employed but making those notice that a
good thing for my employees but people
who are working in the field of law
medicine even teachers after the episode
of these roles too will be impacted by
artificial intelligence and the research
is quite clear
other than excuse me means up to 46% of
all roles will be replaced by artificial
intelligence in Australia instead of
viewing this as a as a threat but we
really need to be looking at this as an
opportunity and opportunity will come to
us in the form of time it&#39;s estimated
that over the coming years that
approximately 2 hours will be freed up
for
to form other tasks rather than having
to perform those routines into the task
identity today and if we use this
confidently this can require an
additional two trillion dollars to
Australia&#39;s GDP the question is like
that has their job roles change heaven
with the best use of the time that
artificial intelligence can fly out to
us
and had we used that time to focus on
the human elements of all of our
professions let&#39;s look at some
professions today and see how artificial
intelligence mach3 out time for us to
perform other tasks in the field in the
county
traditionally there&#39;s been lots of
accountants seen from computers got a
few numbers just the solution for the
tax office before this work could be
automated by technology into the lab to
focus with us today plants in the field
of law also a lot of time is taken by
less having to research presidents laws
legislation before they can give
detailed legal advice to apply instead
today
artificial intelligence already exists
that can be used by an unbelievable
person to pass a petition or exam in the
field of law define official husband&#39;s
intelligence can be used to cut that
time short for the research
personal relationship with the car in
the field of medicine if you take the
example your visit to a general
practitioner you might make an
appointment for several weeks in advance
be going wait you wait wait and then
eventually the doctor sees you that
might take some ask you some questions
type where the computer and the city way
with the script imagine in a home world
where this whole time frame is
compressed and the moment you walk into
the doctor&#39;s surgery the doctor can use
artificial intelligence and software
already have prepared seven different
treatment plans for the doctor can spend
more time building a better
patient-doctor relationship the other
day in Melbourne I was walking back to
my car and crash turned around an old
black drug that heavy bicyclist the
undergrowth and water landing spot but
an enemy scenario in a future world the
smart wearable device that had been
warned by the bicyclist good detective
they meet with enough force versus
thanks of serious injuries maybe even
breakfast of Barnes and then those would
be automatically dispatched at the same
time of the ambulance is negotiating
efficient traffic because abstain
directed to the traffic management
system over half
they said back to that ambulance driver
the Phoenicians and hospital at the
hospital ever frankly many more wrinkles
are automatically pulled up and the end
result is that the patient receives the
best possible medical care possible at
the same time so all this was discussed
and there are all examples of how
professions that were traditionally the
main professions
might one day be largely or totally
undertaken by artificial intelligence
artificial intelligence they free up the
time for us to focus on the human
connections of a professions rather than
to concentrate on the mechanics of the
transaction rather than replacing humans
altogether
it&#39;s going to be people who can leverage
the power of the speed and the
literature distinguish Arkansas and lens
to focus on them on the more human
evidence of our jobs for anyone who have
his children playing this game Pokemon
go it allows me to use this the camera
that we get in on a smartphone to mix it
with
so the game in what schools augmented
reality in the future and I but that&#39;ll
be greasing with me one which
information services and delivered in a
mode what&#39;s being called augmented
intelligence just like technology in the
form of an excavator replace artificial
intelligence which sucks it&#39;s like you
people grab you can deliver the
information generated by artificial
intelligence to other people in a way
that generates a human connection who us
have gone out to look maybe it behind
any vacuum cleaner or maybe a bigger
pair such as IndyCar sometimes you go to
the school and the salesperson will come
out and I&#39;ll stop working their magic on
you and sometimes you walk away from the
points both in hoochies that culture
other times you try that with a lot of
brand-new you babe when you&#39;re just
going to look at a Compaq blue patch
they have you think about why this
happens is because we&#39;re dealing with
people and sometimes you connect with
people and sometimes you got sometimes
you just have that back feeling that you
can do business with someone
and it&#39;s about feeling as a human
attribute and other human attributes of
intuition creativity empathy and
emotional intelligence that really can&#39;t
be replaced by artificial intelligence
this is reflected in the fact that all
people who were engaged in profession
disciples it&#39;s expected that only non
simplest people will have their jobs
replaced by artificial intelligence and
why is this is because those types of
roles in science that required a
personal relationship isn&#39;t something
that can be easily replaced by a machine
we&#39;re running at the beginning of what
artificial intelligence from Natalie
rusty delivers to us in the future if we
imagine a world in 10 20 30 years time
we might finish at work that happy to
have self-driven cars and spend that
time to focus on building better
relationships with that clients or with
their family we can do that and that
happen to concentrate on traffic on the
way home the fridge notice that we&#39;ve
got certain grades you know that&#39;s what
we had yesterday and that is what we
like to ate and it&#39;s despatched the
driver waits for tonight&#39;s dinner and we
get high we can spend more time thanking
that family
yeah smart devices smart wearing device
ability to smile and they&#39;ll be able to
monitor health statistics constantly and
advise a doctor or clinician before a
crease of undergoing a potentially
serious drug but the fact is that we
don&#39;t even know where artificial
intelligence is going to take us but
imagine a world where we have more time
and more time is no longer an excuse the
benefits of our world was the ability to
focus and connect at a human level
because it doesn&#39;t matter who we are
where we were what industry we read what
products or services that we deliver
they ultimately all relate back to
people we need to impress the future of
an AI world ultimately is the
opportunity of having more time that I
don&#39;t deliver that will allow us to
engage and focus more deeply on people
because the smart or any other
technology that will replace
you
