what does it mean to be human I want to
share with you the possibility that it
means moving this container that we call
a body so that we can connect with our
environment ourselves and each other so
I invite you now to stand up if you can
and join me in getting human get
comfortable make sure there&#39;s nothing
around you is gonna get movie excellent
okay
plant your feet into the earth get
steady turn and look over one shoulder
and just breathe here everything is good
the mic is working you&#39;re all standing
start to connect with your breath and
come back to Center look over the other
shoulder now if somebody decided to go
the other way and you&#39;re making eye
contact with somebody and it&#39;s a little
awkward maybe tell them they&#39;re
beautiful come back to Center and let&#39;s
start rounding our shoulders forward
maybe tucking our chin letting it fall
down and then open up unfurl like a
flower and then come back into your
rounded posture opening up again maybe
doing it a little bit quicker a few more
times
unfurling as big as you want
maybe you&#39;re touching your neighbor
that&#39;s okay that&#39;s human - one more like
this and then bring your arms all the
way up reach for the sky ground into the
floor and then let&#39;s all start to lean
yeah good see when I lean in one
direction everyone goes the right way so
excellent
maybe grab on to your wrist or your hand
and just give a gentle tug notice your
edge maybe that edge is inside your body
maybe it&#39;s because your
bumping into your neighbor and be gentle
no matter what that edge is start to
think about your breath again and then
come back let&#39;s get that other side
shall we very nice maybe you start to
lighten your foot on the inside and then
come on back up keep the arms up firmly
plant the feet maybe softly bend the
knees and then turn to your left
whew oh did you all turn different ways
maybe give each other a little hug if
you&#39;re facing your neighbor big deep
breaths come back to the center
and go to the other side you don&#39;t have
to do exactly what I do and then come
back to Center we&#39;re gonna do that again
one more time on each side maybe it
feels a little different this time
inhale come back through Center last one
on this side you all look beautiful come
on back we&#39;re gonna do one more thing
with our arms up but we&#39;re just gonna
bring the elbows down to our sides watch
your neighbour and we&#39;re gonna bring the
room together we&#39;re all gonna use each
other for the next one so you&#39;re gonna
interlace hands with your neighbor good
some of you are a little far from your
neighbor you&#39;re doing well and you&#39;re
gonna use your neighbor to help bounce I
love that there&#39;s bridging between the
alleys this is amazing and we&#39;re gonna
start to get real light on our right
foot I know this is my left but I&#39;m
really smart and I can do opposites and
then you&#39;re gonna lift that foot very
bravely yes cuz you&#39;ve got your
neighbors and they&#39;re gonna help you
look I&#39;ve got no one
okay are we feeling strong are we
feeling balanced can we go all the way
up oh you guys look amazing
Oh bring the foot down come on back down
we got one more foot don&#39;t don&#39;t fool me
start to get light on that left foot
just dance with it and then see we&#39;ve
got some eager people with their arms up
already start to lift that leg use your
neighbor feel what they&#39;re feeling are
you out of balance are they out of
balance can you help more and then reach
keep this guy&#39;s got balance up here big
time oh come on back down
let&#39;s shrug it out we&#39;ve had our arms up
there for a while well done maybe Pat
each other on the back if you&#39;re feeling
really good about your neighbors help
and then let&#39;s just sum some circles
with our hips a little bit loosen it out
get playful with it bumping your
neighbor and then other direction
[Music]
and we&#39;re gonna finish with ten breaths
I know you&#39;re you&#39;re all really worried
but don&#39;t worry you breathe all the time
without even thinking about it
but we&#39;re gonna breathe together we&#39;re
gonna connect this whole room cuz right
now you&#39;ve only connected with people
very close to you but when we breathe
and we move together we all come
together as one so let&#39;s squat down yeah
and get real small like a little seed
good you&#39;re all doing great some of you
are taller than others I know and then
you&#39;re gonna inhale and get big and
you&#39;re gonna exhale and get small again
and exhale gets small again now start to
notice your neighbors and move with them
and breathe with them so that we all
start moving together it looks so
