I am do a lot of like public speaking
but I want you to do something different
today because it&#39;s like a special
occasion you know a TED talk so I&#39;m
gonna become a poet overnight and I&#39;m
gonna do a spoken word or try to just
make a word about my body and my journey
with like loving myself so without
further ado I&#39;ll just begin thoughts
thoughts thoughts are a powerful thing
and five years old I should have been
thinking about the Spice Girls bike
riding or Barbie and Ken instead all I
thought was my thighs are too big my
tummy is fat why oh why can&#39;t I just be
thin you see his children we have fed
the same messages the same words and the
same images you&#39;ve got to be tall you&#39;ve
got to be small you&#39;ve got to be able
and most importantly stable and please
girl please don&#39;t forget the colour of
your skin because white is right right
and black came in you can turn on the TV
you can open a magazine and we are
bombarded with one ideal of beauty so
what happens when that&#39;s not me or you
what do you do when you&#39;re not beautiful
and when the body you were given isn&#39;t
enough when you hate yourself so much
that you just stop caring and wherever
you walk you feel like everyone is
staring glancing at your massive size as
they rub and your flabby arms as they
flounce and you wish away days weeks
months to just be thinner I just want it
to be thinner
and if I could have disappeared I
would&#39;ve believed me I tried fortunately
I failed several attempts to take my
life the fear of living fat made me not
want to live at all and I blamed myself
for years even though it wasn&#39;t my fault
Society has created this box and if you
don&#39;t sit too bad and even when I was
freaking starving
I still didn&#39;t fit and too bad I throw
up my food or just not eat at all
because nothing tastes as good as skinny
feels does it no nothing at all only
pizza chocolate scrambled eggs and
crisps mangos corn on the cob burgers
and chips just drink some water grace
you don&#39;t need to eat that grace you&#39;re
not hungry grace being thin means more
to you grace I know it was bad when I
fainted in dance class and I came around
sat on my fat ass with everyone looking
at me
and I could see in their eyes that they
knew they knew I was starving but what
did they do they did nothing and that&#39;s
when I knew that being sin was the most
important thing and when I had to eat
and I couldn&#39;t leave the table I was
overcome with guilt I was at war with
myself and my past and I&#39;m stood with
shame and who can I possibly blame me of
course everything around me taught me
that I was worthless and everyone around
me confirmed that too from the comment
about my pizza cross neck and you&#39;ve
lost weight you look good now boo
I was so distance from my body that I&#39;ve
used every part of it but just with my
thoughts or my food but with sharp
objects - I&#39;ll cut it I would slice it I
would pick and prod and I would allow
others to use me as they wanted
but when they force themselves inside of
me and I closed my eyes and thought this
is my life now little did I know I would
become disgrace somehow throughout my
childhood I learned that fat is the
worst thing I could possibly be and my
body would forever mean more than me and
the narrative that you can love yourself
without being thin just wasn&#39;t a thing
and if I could just lose one more pound
I&#39;d finally be beautiful I&#39;d finally be
worthy and nobody would hurt me
including me I&#39;d finally be successful
and happy and loved and all of those
things if I could just be thin I&#39;m gonna
reach 26 and I&#39;ve had enough I&#39;ve been
stuck in this circle of self-hate for
far too long
and everything I thought I knew I was
now challenging and I was longing to be
at peace with my home you see I didn&#39;t
realize there was another way that thin
wasn&#39;t everything added me to be
anything other than Who I am today
so I am here to tell you like I wish
someone had told me that you are
absolutely deserving of happiness and
love just open your eyes and see you
were everything they said you&#39;re not and
everything that you want to be you are
beautiful and powerful and you always
have been I learned to love myself when
I start placing my beauty in someone
else&#39;s hands and I realized quite
quickly the way all fed lies and the
only thing that truly matters is how we
see ourselves through our own eyes that
we as women are bullied and forced into
an ideal that so many of us cannot
achieve if we&#39;re brave enough to break
free to see our own beauty we can
overcome all those boundaries my home is
this this body and Who am I to go
against how I was
created molded shaped made from the hair
on my big toe to the freckles on my face
and so what if my tummy isn&#39;t flat and
my thighs touch I have the biggest
cheesiest grin and the kindest of hearts
I am more than what I look like a quote
from Al Murray that and I came of not
being perfect because that&#39;s perfect to
me so to you I am so sorry
my beautiful home my body thank you
