the audacity to dream the blind faith
the strength and the power to dream the
truth of the matter is we&#39;ve been
dreaming since we were children I mean
if you ask us as children we wanted to
be doctors and lawyers and businessmen
superheroes and for some unicorns
I mean Hey I mean bright and beautiful
unicorns running through the wind and if
you looked at the child and said a
unicorn really they would look back at
you with such confidence of yes and all
of us had that confidence and what we
were able to dream and then somewhere on
this journey that we call life we may
have encountered negativity and in
encountering that negativity we began to
doubt who we were and we began to
second-guess those dreams I had that
encounter bright-eyed bushy-tailed young
lady getting ready to go into the field
of advocacy I was ready for the world
didn&#39;t get everything right but I felt
like I was ready one of my colleagues in
the field had some respect for at that
time said you&#39;re not fit to be an
advocate you&#39;re not fit for this field I
had to make a decision right there do I
allow those words of negativity to shape
my world or do I allow my voice to speak
life to my own dream that was a decision
and that&#39;s a decision that all of us
have to make because it&#39;s not that we
don&#39;t have dreams it&#39;s that we&#39;ve
allowed negativity we&#39;ve allowed fear
we&#39;ve allowed doubt to become louder
than all of our dreams we placed our
dreams on the back burner to make sure
that others accomplish theirs we put our
dreams on the back burner because they
seemed like they were too much they
overwhelmed us
and then you&#39;ll get to a point like I
did will you look up and you stare and
you say to yourself wait a minute
you&#39;ve got it you&#39;ve been born for this
the earth has purposed for you to be
born for such a time as this the earth
moans and it groans for you to fulfill
your dreams Walt Disney says that all
dreams can come true if we have the
courage to pursue them so then the great
idea becomes not that I don&#39;t have the
dream but how do I have the courage to
make that dream a reality
it&#39;s simple real simple believe in you
because you have exactly what it takes
sometimes we will find ourselves saying
I wish that there was this restaurant
and I wish that there was this book to
be written I wish that this was this and
this was that I wish I wish I wish that
all of these things were happening in
the world may I suggest that the ideas
that you&#39;re wishing to see you carry may
I suggest that what you desire to see in
this earth you actually possess the
ability to create it you just have to
have the ability to believe in you
because you&#39;ve got it so now it becomes
what I had to learn to do calm down calm
down assess the situation believe in you
and make your footprint make your
footprint on this world because it&#39;s
waiting for you make your footprint on
this world because someone&#39;s looking to
know that it can be done but they&#39;ll
never know that it can be done if you
don&#39;t step out of your comfort zone
in order for us to obtain the greater
and be who we are ordained to be in this
earth we have to become uncomfortable
with being comfortable the earth calls
for us and so when it calls for us then
that means that our icann must be
greater than my I can&#39;t
it means that my I will must be greater
than my I won&#39;t because when we leave
this earth the earth must know that we
have come we have arrived and we have
fulfilled the dreams that are in every
last one of us so it&#39;s simple it&#39;s
simple it is simple
stop looking outside of you for what you
have the ability to create within stop
looking for everyone else to create what
you are purposed to do now you have it
you were born for it so now make it
happen
leave your mark leave your footprint and
at the end of the day the world will
know that you have been here and you
have been great you have been brave and
you have been unapologetically you thank
you
