you remember the game Connect four
perhaps I&#39;m dating myself but I have
vivid memories playing this game
countless times with family and friends
the goal of this game is to connect four
pieces of the same color diagonally
horizontally or vertically before the
other player does so just last week I
was at the library and out of the blue I
saw the game connect four and it
immediately brought a smile to my face
recalling fun times playing this game
today
I would like to share with you four
words that begin with the letter C that
help us meaningfully connect in our
daily living just as one needs four
pieces in a row in the game Connect for
one needs these four C&#39;s to build
authentic relationships and cultivate
meaningful connections this is a tiered
approach meaning the first C is the
foundational level C upon which the
other C&#39;s are built
let&#39;s connect four C&#39;s and come alive
the first C is care do you remember
hallmarks famous slogan when you care
enough to send the very best
let&#39;s say it together when you care
enough to send the very best
did you know this slogan was created by
Mister Cee Goodman a hallmark marketing
sales executive in 1944 he scribbled the
slogan on a 3x5 index card now today
more than 70 years later that very index
card is proudly displayed at the
company&#39;s headquarters in Kansas City
even though this slogan was created in
1944 it still rings true today because
caring is timeless we can learn from
hallmark I&#39;ve adapted their iconic
slogan to help us meaningfully connect
in our daily living when you care enough
to give
the very best of you when you care
enough to give the very best of you
let&#39;s say that together when you care
enough to give the very best of you
giving the very best of you is giving
your heart care is all about giving your
heart to create meaningful connections
the second C is calm by calm I mean our
presence our aura presence is more than
simply showing up presence is how we
show up artist and actor mos def States
my presence speaks volumes before I say
a word
presence is about being all there being
fully present fully focused are we
looking at our cell phone are we looking
at our watch or are we fully attentive
fully engaged our presence how we show
up to any given situation can greatly
impact our connection there may be no
words to say our presence says it all I
will always remember receiving that
telephone call from my mom sharing if I
wanted to see my grandfather I needed to
come home now I called my grandfather
pop up
I cared the world about him pop up was
like my dad he was a dairy farmer even
though he didn&#39;t graduate high school he
was the most intelligent strong wise
caring compassionate loving patient
person I&#39;ve ever known now he lay in bed
at home hospice was there trying to
minimize the pain and provide some sort
of comfort I immediately got a flight my
mom shared with him that I was on my way
to see him during the day his eyes were
open but after the long day of travel
across country to get to pop up his eyes
were closed
I will always remember sitting by his
bedside holding his hand in that moment
the power of presence was the most
meaningful connection our presence
speaks volumes and helps us create
authentic connections the third C is cor
when I think of cor I think of my
favorite core exercise holding planks
call me crazy but I enjoy planks as you
may know in order to successfully hold a
plank the right alignment is critical if
we are in the right alignment holding a
plank is actually easier and we can
sustain it for longer periods of time
because we are in the right alignment if
we are in the right alignment we
actually feel lighter
rather than heavier holding plank
because we are in the right alignment
similarly in creating a connection the
right alignment is critical our words
and our actions need to be aligned in
order to create a healthy connection
meaning we&#39;re not saying one thing and
doing another our words and our actions
are aligned we are filled with integrity
in order to create a healthy connection
active listening is key
simply put listen more talk less
a connection is not about me me me me me
me a connection is all about we I
recently participated in a daily plank
challenge holding plank for a certain
length of time each day my challenge to
you and to me is what about a daily
connection challenge I challenge each of
us to participate in a daily connection
challenge making meaningful connections
with others daily priorities in our
lives let&#39;s join together in a daily
connection challenge reaching out to one
another
connecting making that a priority and we
can start today right here at this event
join me in that daily connection
challenge this challenge leads me to the
fourth and final si call this fourth C
of call elevates the connection it takes
it to the next level it&#39;s our call to
action say yes now is the time
say yes to giving the very best of you
say yes to giving your heart say yes to
being a calming presence say yes to
showing up effectively say yes to
aligning words and actions say yes to
listening more
say yes to focusing on we rather than me
now is the time to say yes we can learn
from the wisdom of Howard Thurman author
educator philosopher civil rights leader
to paraphrase a quote from him don&#39;t ask
yourself what the world needs ask
yourself what makes you come alive the
world needs more people who have come
alive so I ask you what makes you
meaningfully connect and come alive now
is the time now is the time to say yes
as Nike so famously states just do it
now is the time to connect the four C&#39;s
of care calm core and call and truly
come alive thank you
