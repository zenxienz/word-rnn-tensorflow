you
[Applause]
thank you yay
thank you thank you very much
[Music]
yeah I feel deeply honored to be able to
perform here to TEDx
yeah I was always a big fan boy of the
whole thing so kind of nervous but it
would be good about the topic I also
experience kind of the same thing when I
started beatboxing some people thought I
was crazy because at this time I was a
guy with dreadlocks long like this and
the beatboxing wasn&#39;t there properly so
many sounds sounded like farting so you
know you have a guy on the building side
painting walls and making weird noise
and dreadlocks so but some people they
told me it&#39;s annoying and I should stop
but I did but lately I didn&#39;t and that&#39;s
the thing I imagine something what I
wish to do I wanted to do it and I just
did it and nobody should ever tell you
to don&#39;t do anything when you really
decide and love it that&#39;s the most
important thing aful so just for example
beatboxing it&#39;s loud it&#39;s a lot about
just training very simple things and
make it perfect so there are few little
tricks you can easily learn and just by
training these little tricks you get
pretty sick people skills that you&#39;re
not the best but for the party it&#39;s sick
enough so it&#39;s one easy thing is you
just say like polka tika taka taka
sounds easy
I know and you just repeat it pitaka
and very important you pronounce each
sound very sharply and
de caca and if you speed it up and when
you&#39;re in the groove it&#39;s like good one
well you were training I before this is
like this it sounds when you train so I
got one more sound and this is a one of
my favorite sounds because I&#39;m a pretty
clumsy person so I hit myself a lot and
therefore my special sound was ow
and yeah and but time I got creative
with my house and I made the word
shorter and I was pitching the sound so
it started with ow ow
oh there we go
alright so then I thought okay let&#39;s do
some melodies with it
[Applause]
thanks a lot all right
things are running really smoothly so
I&#39;m super happy about that this is great
there&#39;s one thing because I&#39;m pretty
much a clop beatboxer so I&#39;m really used
to for audience which is sitting so I
really want to turn my clap mode on and
I need you guys to get up because else I
might screw up so I need you guys to
support me all right
feel free to go crazy don&#39;t smash the
screen everything else I don&#39;t care
get rid of the chants or whatever don&#39;t
smash the screen all right so ladies and
gentlemen
