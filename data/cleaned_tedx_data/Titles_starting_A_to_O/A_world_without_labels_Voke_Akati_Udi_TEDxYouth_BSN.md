you
you
imagine a world not without labels but
without the assumptions behind these
labels now labels can be good if for
whatever reason you have a bottle in
your fridge labeled poison you would
know not to drink that and inadvertently
kill yourself
for example chlorine is a harmful
harmful poison and yet it&#39;s used in
everyday life
for cleaning swimming pools in this
bleach it uses poison being used as a
useful thing and therefore even then
there are limitations behind the
assumptions behind this label labels are
also good because they show our
diversity now I am black I am female and
I am a feminist now these are my labels
and I stand proud of each and every one
of them they define me
now what doesn&#39;t define me are the
assumptions behind these labels the
assumption that because I&#39;m black I&#39;m
going to steal something or that because
I&#39;m female
I&#39;m lesser or weaker than my male
counterparts or that because I&#39;m a
feminist I&#39;m too opinionated and I hate
men now the problem I have with these
labels with these assumptions is that
they are tied to other people they are
not tied to me people&#39;s experiences with
other people who have the same labels as
me and made them to call have caused
them to make assumptions about me my
behavior and my character without
getting to know me in the first place
now a few years ago the class may
deliver the presentation she didn&#39;t tell
anyone what it was about she simply
asked the class to raise their hands up
if they believed in gender equality and
the entire class put their hands up she
then asked them to keep their hands up
if they would call themselves a feminist
at least three-quarters of the hands
went down
and yet the merriam-webster dictionary
definition of feminism is a theory of
the political economic and social
equality of the sexes and therefore by
definition feminism and gender equality
are one and the same also there are
millions of feminists around the world
and therefore feminism means something
different to every feminist and
therefore the dictionary definition is
the only thing tying us all together
these assumptions that people have about
feminism
there they come from radical feminists
whose voices shout the loudest and
therefore people make sweeping
assumptions about the entirety of
feminism based off of a small sample
group now this is just one example out
of millions I could go on and on for
days about all the different stereotypes
behind labels and why we should
challenge them but why do we have these
assumptions in the first place
two main ideas fear and security we are
afraid of what would happen if we don&#39;t
have these strongholds in place and
these assumptions give us a false sense
of security if we assume that all
feminists are angry then we can stay
away from feminists and if we assume
that all vegan people are condescending
then we can judge vegan people as well
and know not to include them in
conversations and also because we&#39;re
lazy if someone tells us their labels
whether that&#39;s being a feminist or being
vegan or being a Christian we can
already make a picture in our minds of
what we expect these people to be and
isn&#39;t that so much easier than actually
having to get to know the person now I
want you to imagine a world where we
don&#39;t have these labels how much better
the world would be and it starts with
two main ideas fear and security how
freeing would it be to be able to say
I&#39;m a feminist
without any fear of repercussions how
freeing with the beats be able to
express who you are without any
hesitation now the same way these
assumptions give us a sense of security
the lack of them does as well I can feel
more secure in my labels if I know that
no one is going to judge me based on
those labels we can all feel more secure
if we know that people will judge us
based on who we are and not based on who
people with the same labels as us are
now how do we get there we have to ask
more questions and be open to more
answers these are these assumptions that
we&#39;ve grown so used to so accustomed to
we have to challenge them and next time
we&#39;re making a judgment on someone we
have to ask ourselves why are making
that judgment and if it&#39;s solely based
on the labels and the assumptions behind
these labels then we have to question
that for example
I think that person&#39;s really
condescending why do you think that
well he&#39;s vegan and the last time I&#39;m a
vegan person they were condescending so
me that&#39;s wrong we should challenge that
I think she&#39;s a bad person why do you
think that because she robbed a bank
okay that&#39;s very enough
now I&#39;d like to sum this all up by
imploring all of you
let&#39;s as a society stop being lazy let&#39;s
question what we&#39;ve always known let&#39;s
learn to judge people based on the based
on who they are and not based on the
assumptions behind their labels my name
is Volk a catio D I am black I am female
and I am a feminist thank you
