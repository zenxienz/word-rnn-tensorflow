when I was 27 my life was amazing I was
about a year into my first full proper
job as a lawyer in a top London law firm
and I&#39;ve been sent to Bangkok for a few
months as part of my training I loved it
I was doing the job that I&#39;d wanted to
do for my whole life living in a 5-star
hotel meeting people from all over the
world learning about a brand new culture
eating really really good food and
getting to travel to places that I&#39;d
wanted to see for my whole life on my
time off I felt the freest I&#39;ve ever
felt then I got hit by the 2004 tsunami
I was lucky I survived but I lost my leg
a few weeks later back in London I
wished my old life I wanted to be a
normal 27 year old lawyer jumping out of
bed in the morning running to the cheap
station ready for my thought a full day
at work despite all the partying I&#39;d
done the previous weekend but my new
reality was very different I would often
wake up from a long sleep completely
forget that I didn&#39;t have a lower right
leg go to jump out of bed fall on the
floor stump first and being a lot of
pain in the hospital they also gave me a
wheelchair to help me to get around but
while it was useful if my friends were
with me forgetting from A to B I hated
it I wanted my freedom of my
independence back and it was incredibly
heavy and difficult to maneuver but when
I looked at the alternative which was a
pair of crutches they terrified me I had
no idea how I was gonna hop up and down
all the stairs that he finds in any big
city with them never mind the escalators
in London tube stations I vividly
remember standing on top of an escalator
looking at the stairs moving down trying
to pluck the courage up to hop on and
just having visions of all the disasters
that
before me if I got it wrong swimming in
front of my eyes as were thousands of
two-legged people all desperate to get
to work
come wondering what I was doing standing
at the top of the escalator looking at
it scared and then I thought back to
when I was 18 when I was 18 I was tipped
by my school for great things well on
the way to brilliant a level results in
a great university place unfortunately
it all went wrong I fell in love with a
boy just at the time I was meant to be
revising the hardest and my exams so
sadly instead of standing at the
university freshers fayre the October
after I finished my levels I actually
found myself behind the counter at the
Christmas decorations departments of my
local department store I was devastated
my whole life until then I&#39;d comforted
myself when I was down with the
knowledge that even though I might not
be the prettiest kind of funniest
sportiest most popular girl at school I
was at least clever and until then I&#39;d
been able to get by pretty well on my
brain&#39;s alone without really having to
do any work but that had all come
crashing down I had had fun with the boy
though
and but I I dealt with it
and I learned what it meant to work hard
for the next couple of years I got
myself a place at the University I&#39;d
wanted to go to anyway and by the time
of the tsunami I was living my dream and
I&#39;d learned in the process that even if
things get really difficult and you
don&#39;t know how to get out of them as
long as you just keep going and
embracing the challenges that that bring
that is brought to you you&#39;re likely
gonna get to where you want to go to
anyway even if you have to do it in a
bit of a roundabout way so back to the
crutches I decided to go for it
I put the wheelchair in the Attic bought
myself a relatively classy backpack to
wear to work instead of all the good
fake handbags I bought in Bangkok and
learned how to hop up and down on the
escalators and also learned how to hop
around on one high heel and I did it I
conquered the crutches and it gave me my
freedom of my independence back and also
reinforced to me what I&#39;d learned when I
was 18 there were also some good things
about any having one leg for example I
discovered that it was a great excuse
not to do
any housework and that excuse survives
till this day is my husband on a test
and also I realized that my socks would
last me twice as long n even when it
rains even today I love the fact that I
can only feel one wet trouser leg
flapping around my ankles then I got my
first prosthetic leg
needless to say I&#39;d been incredibly
excited about this before the big day
came and I&#39;d had visions of getting the
leg stripping it on like Cinderella
running off into the sunset doing a few
marathons in the process never to have
to go back to the hospital of course the
reality was very different on the day I
got the leg it wasn&#39;t really much
different to any other day at that time
I hopped to the hospital on my crutches
tried the leg on yelps in agony took it
straight back off again hops back home
on my crutches had a glass of wine and
cries it was incredibly painful and I
realized at that stage that my journey
back to being a fully fledged
two-legged person was really an edit
only it&#39;s very beginning even worse I
worried that it might never happen and
so I reached my low point it happened
one Saturday afternoon my boyfriend and
I had arranged to go to the pub with
some of our friends but I woke up that
morning in a really really bad mood the
hospital had given me some pills while I
was there to help with my phantom nerve
pain and by that Saturday afternoon the
pills had started to give me spots now
having one leg was one thing that could
be hidden kind of having spots was quite
another I tried and tried to have to
cover them up with makeup but they were
too bad it just wasn&#39;t gonna happen they
felt like these big red shiny beacons
standing out on my face for the whole
world to see to make matters even worse
my friend insisted that I bring my
wheelchair to the pub with me she said
that her house where we were going
afterwards was too far away from the pub
for me to be able to hop there on
crutches I reluctantly agrees but I was
not happy about it so
we went to the pub finished up and we&#39;re
preparing to leave at that stage the
anger and the resentment about what had
happened to me started to rise up
why was either one in this wheelchair
when all the people standing around me
had two perfectly well-functioning legs
to walk on in fact I&#39;d had two pretty
good legs before the tsunami it hit they
look really good in skirts and shorts
why could it not have happened to
somebody with two bad legs why did I
have to sit here in this wheelchair with
my ugly stunt standing out in front of
me for the whole world to see so I did
what any sensible British person would
do and decided that I bring my bottle of
wine with me in the wheelchair on the
way back from the pub and as I didn&#39;t
have to crunch anywhere and had some
hands-free I thought it would also be a
great idea to light up a cigarette so
imagine you&#39;re walking down the street
in London on a sunny Saturday afternoon
and you see a young girl sitting in a
wheelchair being wheeled why her
increasingly nervous looking boyfriend&#39;s
swinging from a bottle of white wine and
chain smoking cigarettes
well well screaming at everybody she can
see asking what they&#39;re staring at what
could they have been staring at I asked
myself
needless to say my boyfriend&#39;s pretty
much ran all the way back to my friend&#39;s
house to try and avoid potential arrest
in the cold light of day the following
morning I was incredibly ashamed and
embarrassed that I&#39;d let myself lose
control of my emotions quite so badly I
also started to think about how lucky
I&#39;d been once again my boyfriend and I
had been rescued from the uninhabited
island that we&#39;d been on when the
tsunami hit by a speedboat which took us
back to the mainland and to the local
cottage hospital there really quickly
within probably about an hour of a
tsunami hitting after that my colleagues
have flown down to that from Bangkok to
southern Thailand to find us and then
using my health insurance they chartered
an ambulance
and then a private plane to bring me
back to Bangkok within a few days I knew
that had any one of those pieces of luck
not come to me I wouldn&#39;t have survived
I also kept thinking about the Thai man
he&#39;d been in the hospital bed next to me
for the first few days he was about my
age and he&#39;s hit he must have hit his
head on some rocks his injuries look
really bad and I doubt very much he
survived but his family helped me so
much every time I needed water they got
some water for me and whenever my pain
got too much for me they found nurses to
come and help and give me some
medication which was no mean feat in the
hospital we were in which was overrun
with people his injuries were so much
worse than mine and his family must have
known that I was likely to survive and
be rescued whilst he was not yet they
treated me with incredible kindness and
compassion and I started to question why
I&#39;d survived and been saved when by
rights I had no real reason to have been
in some fleeting moments I even wondered
whether I&#39;d been saved because I was
destined to do great things for the
world things that would be a million
miles away from my day job as a
commercial lawyer but when I thought
more about it in my logical mind I
realized that of course that wasn&#39;t the
case I just been lucky and I&#39;d had
really good health insurance while
travel insurance so I made a choice I
decided that as I&#39;ve been giving a
chance to have my life back
I was gonna live it as fully as I could
but also but I&#39;d used any influence that
I had along the way to try to help
people he won&#39;t support me as I&#39;d been I
also decided not to let myself be
defined by my leg and that I owed that
to the man in the hospital bed next to
me I decided I wanted to live as normal
and as humble a life as I could and I
didn&#39;t want people to pity me or even
celebrate me because of what had
happened to me so I carried on doing my
day job my boyfriend and I carried on
going to the pub quite a lot
but I also signed up for a charity bike
ride from Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam to
Angkor Wat in Cambodia which was
somewhere that I&#39;d look to go a couple
of weeks after the tsunami hit but never
made it to when I signed up for the ride
I still couldn&#39;t walk well without
crutches or at all without crutches and
I didn&#39;t even know whether I could ride
a bike but I had faith from what I&#39;d
done before but I&#39;d be able to manage it
so I went out bought my bike sat on the
saddle put my feet in the pedals and
took myself my first wobbly rallies
around are thankfully quite quiet London
streets and I did it all without falling
off or breaking any more legs I was
delighted I trained for the rides by
cycling to and from work every day and I
loved it I&#39;d get up in the morning get
on my bike cycle down the hill and
across the park by where we lived
passing lots of grey depressed looking
tube commuters on the way and half an
hour later I&#39;d be racing across London
Bridge with all the other cyclists all
before sliding past lots of stationary
cars and buses and lorries in central
London and arriving at the office to
start my day and the best thing about it
because I couldn&#39;t bring my crutches on
the back of my bike I had to abandon
them
and before I knew it I was back walking
on two legs without anything else to
help me it was liberating and you know
what it wasn&#39;t that difficult once I
threw the crutches away because I had to
and just gave it a go
I realized that it was much easy and I
thought it was gonna be I completed the
ride in December 2006 along with 20
other two-legged people and after that
spent three weeks backpacking around
Asia on my own
visiting all the places that I&#39;d wanted
to see two years before but couldn&#39;t
my journey finished in Bangkok and my
law firms Christmas party I&#39;d come full
circle and in the process I&#39;d gained my
freedom my independence and a normal
life back all on my own terms of course
the story didn&#39;t stop then six months
after the bike cries my boyfriend and I
moved to Hong Kong we got married
I didn&#39;t I did another charity bike ride
this time across the Andes in Peru I
continued to try to challenge myself in
my job carrying on working in law firms
and then NGOs and CSR consultancies
before my current job in a bank and I&#39;ve
also tried my best along the way to use
my influence to try to help people who
were less fortunate than me so I
partnered with NGOs participated in CSR
initiatives and until earlier this year
I headed up the disability advocacy
Network at my organization my husband
and I then had two children and stopped
going to the pub so much really pleased
here my leg also continues to surprise
me a few years ago I took up yoga in the
gym continuing to push myself even
further as to my comfort zone and
realizing in the process that I&#39;m even
less limited than I thought I was so
Lucy&#39;s points I think yoga has become my
opera on really good days you&#39;ll even
sometimes catch me wearing a skirt
showing my two legs off for everyone to
see
I&#39;ve also succeeded and I think in not
letting myself be defined by my leg
because there&#39;s generally a bit of shock
and surprise when people who&#39;ve known me
for a while
asked if there&#39;s something wrong with my
knee and I tell them that my knee is
fine but there&#39;s not very much
underneath it the other week my daughter
even pulled a leg off one of her dolls
saying she wants it to be like mummy my
life&#39;s pretty good really I&#39;m a very
ordinary person I&#39;ve got lots of
weaknesses and self doubts and I get
carried away with my emotions just as
much if not more than everybody else and
I make mistakes all the time sometimes
big ones but whenever I reached a low
point in my life I think back to how
I&#39;ve dealt with it in the past and how
I&#39;ve done it by just embracing the
challenges that I&#39;ve come across and
keeping on going and how that&#39;s made me
a better and stronger person as a result
and that knowledge has given me the
comfort and confidence that the next
time it happens I&#39;ll be able to deal
with it even if I have to do it in a bit
of a roundabout way
so please no matter how ordinary you are
embrace your challenges faced your fears
push yourself out of your comfort zone
because you never know you might just
surprise yourself and one last point do
make sure to get good travel insurance
when you&#39;re going your next holiday
