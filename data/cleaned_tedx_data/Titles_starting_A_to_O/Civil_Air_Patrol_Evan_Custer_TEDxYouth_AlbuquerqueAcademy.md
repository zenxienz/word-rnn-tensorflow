and now on with the show
my name is Esther I am a student at
senior brother and I also a member of
the celebrity alt which probably most of
you have heard of so this so what the
seller poise is that we are an auxilary
of the US air force and our three main
missions is cadet programs emergency
services airs basic communication so
connect programs also incorporates our
specification and immersive services
so whatever services is is
search-and-rescue going on behind
lawmakers down an aircraft and also just
getting to go out on ice and our
specification is that we teach
cadets like myself and others about
aircraft and the fact is that we have
the largest fleet of suspect aircraft
anywhere in the world in the U and it is
in the United States and that&#39;s my age
to fly them for free Fatima&#39;s which is
pretty much calcified liners four five
four five three planes and so the solar
troll was started six days before Pearl
Harbor which is a little bit of a fact
that&#39;s actually a poster that you can&#39;t
make they can made and we actually went
out and looked for German u-boats during
that time and so after the war we kind
of got a reputation for fine stuff like
those units and the Air Force saw they
use us for search and rescue and other
is like leadership training and other
things and so this is actually one of
the aircraft that would it be many
aircraft that had the chasm as its as of
its disposal so Civil Air Patrol has
been a great thing for me and one thing
the many things that I have done over
the past two years that I&#39;ve been an
insular patrol is that I have gone to a
an encampment where you get to hang out
with other cadets in your state for a
week do a lot of drill do some
leadership training and having
all-around good time that&#39;s really fun
and another thing that I did two weeks
after that was I went to the National
Emergency Services Academy in Canterbury
Indiana where I spent a week with other
people from around the nation doing
search and rescue training and this is
actually one of the young ladies that I
did search and as we check that and it&#39;s
also it&#39;s just a great program I love it
it&#39;s been great for me I am currently a
cadet Staff Sergeant and my lungs water
than I am in and it&#39;s just an amazing
program in my opinion it&#39;s really fun
and and so I joined in November 2014 I
was also awarded the pet word the word
Network force water to my camp and this
is also another picture from the Academy
that I go to and that&#39;s make sure my
plate that I can&#39;t
that&#39;s for sure my team at the National
Resources Academy and also another
t-shirt in camelina must say this is one
of my favorite pictures of the time from
that Facebook page
from the national reserves Facebook page
because we ate a lot of MREs and I can
attest to her face every time but I one
of those because me don&#39;t eat beef stew
I&#39;m are evil they&#39;re not that great and
so this is meeting with I&#39;m blanking on
his name but you went up onto the
International Space Station and it was
his presentation that I got to see was
very interesting and so it&#39;s really I
haven&#39;t I think this is a very good
program that some of you guys should get
it and and so if you want to find more
information
- water near you to visit you should go
on to go solar cool calm and that&#39;s more
efficient
