I was only nine years old when I had my
first conversation about addiction
I still feels like yesterday it wasn&#39;t
drugs or alcohol my drug of choice was a
video game you see my parents had had
this horrific divorce and I suspect to
ease the pain my dad came home one
afternoon with a brand-new
state-of-the-art Atari 2600 this was a
very big deal
spending money was out of the norm for
my dad to this day he still uses lemons
and packets of sugar in his water
instead of buying the lemonade at the
restaurant but on that day on that day
after the excitement and shock wore off
my brother and I sat down set up the
console to start playing actually I had
to wait for my brother to leave for
practice and so it was my turn but once
it was my turn I plugged in the game
pitfall and I proceeded to play for
hours I can still actually remember the
sound the cartridge made when you
clicked it into place I kept the game&#39;s
main character Harry running for hours
picking up jewels jumping over
alligators if I miss even one I would go
back to the beginning and I would start
again I was relentlessly imperfect
relentlessly pursuing perfection I was
obsessed with getting the perfect score
but this obsession didn&#39;t last long
because out of the corner of my eye I
saw grandma Drake watching with concern
my grandmother was somebody I treasured
deeply in my life she was the person
that kept me centered in a time full of
divorce poverty and even occasional
homelessness my grandmother was somebody
who no matter what she said to you
it was always honest sometimes brutally
so on that day I continued playing
remember I was obsessed with getting a
perfect score and at last I did achieve
perfection
she had calmly sat there for hours
waiting for me and then invited me to
come talk to her in her room
it&#39;s something that she had done
countless times before but on this day
she sensed that there were some painful
realities that I was ready to hear she
talked to me about my family which I
learned was wrought with addiction drugs
gambling alcohol you name it we had it
but what I was surprised to learn was
how deeply addiction ran in both sides
of my family you can say I was doubly
blessed with what today I fondly call my
genetic lottery but sadly I&#39;m not alone
scientists today estimate that over 50
million Americans will be struggling
with the issue of addiction at some
point in their lifetime 50 million
Americans drugs alcohol gambling
pornography sex even online shopping can
be an addiction and today these are some
of our newest the difference with what I
call socially acceptable addictions is
that that we rarely discuss them trust
me no one said grandma Drake down to
have a conversation about her collection
of over 2000 zebras as a real problem
today we have a new socially acceptable
addiction and it is technology every day
all around the world children spend
countless hours online posting the
social networks online gaming and even
just watching videos the more alarming
part of health this is that many of
these children are receiving their own
personal devices now as early as six or
seven years old when you take into
consideration the most recent census in
the United States that recorded over 21
million children in the United States
under the age of five and you look at
the research that says eighty-five
percent of American parents have allowed
these young children to go online weekly
and in many cases daily since infancy it
means that in the US alone we have over
17 million children growing up endlessly
connected to technology so when we
overlay the successive use of technology
at these critical developmental periods
of children&#39;s developing brains it begs
the question could we potentially be
creating a new generation of addicts
let&#39;s take a look at the science in this
image you see a healthy brain that nice
robust red area is our dopamine
receptors in contrast the brain of a
drug addict the dopamine receptors in
this scan are significantly reduced
now most people still consider dopamine
to be that neuro chemical that makes us
feel good but scientists today
understand that dopamine has more to do
with motivation and reinforcement in our
brain&#39;s reward center you can kind of
think of it as a do it again system
rather than a feel-good system an
addicts brain is motivating them to do
it again and again but even natural
rewards like eating food
having sex before they produce the same
neurochemical responses the difference
is with drugs our brain is flooded with
up to 10 times more dopamine which leads
the user to repeat that behavior again
and again and it leaves more natural
rewards feeling inadequate in comparison
so let&#39;s look at what it is to be a
technology addict the scan that we&#39;re
gonna see is a technology out of who
spent routinely eight hours online
posting the social networks playing
online games or viewing pornography as
you can see in the scan the background
looks a little different because it&#39;s
really recent science but it&#39;s the same
type of scan that&#39;s looking at those
dopamine receptors you can tell that
they&#39;ve been impacted and when we
compare them next to the healthy brain
the damage obvious when we compare the
technology addict to the drug addict the
parallel in the damage occurring
indisputable so what does this all mean
for us well we&#39;re all wired to seek
reward and the tech companies they now
understand how to tap into our primal
drives companies have began hiring
neuroscientists and behaviorist to work
along with their programmers to develop
products that keep users hooked it has
gone beyond the goal of merely producing
useful products to the point where they
are actively seeking ways to keep us all
endlessly connected and if that
corporate strategy sounds familiar it&#39;s
because it is one comedian recently said
Philip Morris only wanted your lungs the
app store wants your soul
I think we can all agree that addiction
is complicated it involves a
relationship between a chemical or a
behavior in concert with genetics
learning or the environment substance
addiction is more easily understood
because when we take something into our
body we can feel it make a difference
but with behavioral addictions it&#39;s that
much harder to identify because there&#39;s
no substance and consequently that much
harder to understand when we&#39;re talking
about addiction what we&#39;re really
talking about is our brain struggle for
control if we&#39;re able to avoid the
substance or the behavior when it&#39;s
causing us problems
great we have no addiction issue but
when we lose control and it starts to
impact our relationships our work or
school our self-esteem or even our
emotional stability then the vicious
cycle of addiction begins microstructure
abnormalities is a phrase it should
stand out to all of us there are
hundreds of studies in development right
now by scientists who are trying to find
answers to provide us all guidance each
of the studies is complex but they&#39;re
looking at minut regions of the brain
and trying to help differentiate between
a healthy brain and a brain of a
technology addict here&#39;s the structure
generally of a brain on the outermost
area you can see that is our gray matter
it&#39;s primarily responsible for
processing our information and our
emotions how is deeper within the brain
is our white matter it&#39;s like the
superhighway of her brain it facilitates
messages between the brain to make sure
that we get our messages to the right
place at the right time so we can act
upon them the scientific research on
technology addiction has shown that we
have a loss of gray matter in critical
areas and a reduced density of white
matter within the brain
even more alarming are the areas of the
brain that are being impacted have to do
with motor control cognition and
motivation as well as areas that process
our emotions our decision-making and our
impulse control
generally the 24/7 access to technology
is making us more impulsive disconnected
anxious and emotionally unregulated than
ever we know now that the more time that
children spend online the more isolated
and depressed they become and the more
time they spend viewing carefully
curated digitally altered social media
post the more inadequate and depressed
they feel you might be asking yourself
well how depressed can kids really
become well one recent study that looked
at 32 different hospitals between 2008
and 2015
found that their hospital admissions
more than doubled for children aged 5 to
17 years old for self-harm suicidal
thinking and suicidal actions another
study reports that there&#39;s been a 200%
increase in suicides among young girls
aged 10 to 14 and a 50% increase in boys
the same age most of these suicides
reportedly related to an online incident
the loss of human connection through
face-to-face communication eye contact
in touch is creating a future for our
children in which they have the
emotional intimacy the compassion and
the empathy is disappearing our society
is becoming more focused on the number
of likes or post receives instead of on
the human connection that like is
supposed to represent
remember these brain scans I lose sleep
over the unintentional damage to our
children&#39;s brains under the misguided
assumptions the technology overuse is
totally harmless of course we can&#39;t keep
our children from technology or it would
put them at a severe disadvantage in a
global economy that requires them to be
proficient with it but I am also acutely
aware from my education that something
as simple as a smartphone can actually
structurally alter my daughter&#39;s brain
and potentially trigger a lifetime of
addiction the world is going to evolve
whether we like it or not technology
especially in technology has undoubtedly
been net positive however with all of
this good comes some bad the question
for us moving forward is not whether we
can figure out a way to have a balanced
relationship with technology it is how
quickly we can get there and what is
that healthy balanced relationship going
to look like I have spent my career
learning and understanding and talking
about the good and bad of technology
grandma Drake taught me about myself but
most importantly she taught me that
empowering children with knowledge and
then trusting them with that information
means that they will often make better
choices because of it we can all step
into the light together now because I
have proof that that actually works my
team and I have been implementing a
program where we&#39;ve empowered kids and
parents and educators with knowledge
about healthy balanced technology use
and the results children do in fact make
better choices for themselves and for
their friends when they&#39;re given the
knowledge and the opportunity this is
some data from a middle school that I
worked in not unlike any other middle
school likely in the US or in the world
that had escalating issues with
technology related incidents cyber
bullying inappropriate posting
plagiarism even sexting as the graph
shows there technology related incidents
had gone from 40 percent to 72 percent
of all of their administrative time
dealing with this in only five years
after implementing our program the
results were actually shocking even to
us educating kids on how to be a good
digital citizen at the same time as
giving parents and educators the tools
and the resources they needed in order
to support these kids through some
change reduce the overall technology
related incidents by over 50 percent
it proves that when we trust our
children with the emerging science and
when we talk to them about the
educational and legal consequences that
they&#39;re facing in every facet of their
lives for the rest of their lives
it gives them good direction on how to
make better choices in this digital
world I believe all children want to
make good choices given the opportunity
but it&#39;s up to us in order to educate
them on how to do this in this new world
everything that we do online is public
and permanent so now that we all know
this emerging science how do we all come
together to make a difference in this
very real issue of Technology addiction
the answer is simply awareness and
education this is an amazing time that
we&#39;re living in in this an amazing group
of people who have all come together to
devour ideas worth spreading technology
has enabled us to do so much good but it
is not totally without consequence
pitfall that&#39;s a really fun game to play
as a kid
but it was essentially a stick figure
running across the screen and maybe four
colors today&#39;s games apps programs much
more sophisticated and the programmers
as we&#39;ve learned highly-skilled on our
vulnerabilities it is imperative that we
come together and we address this issue
boldly honestly and without fear we have
the knowledge we need to rise above this
our our children are counting on us to
become their grandma Drake thank you
