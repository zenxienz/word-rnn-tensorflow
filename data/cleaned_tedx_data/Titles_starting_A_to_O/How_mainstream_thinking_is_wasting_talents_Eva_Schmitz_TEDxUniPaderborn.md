and I&#39;m HD students in social
entrepreneurship and when I called
interest in social entrepreneurship I
had people say things like oh yeah like
Facebook snapchat Twitter yeah great
social media is really a great topic yes
I do research on enterprises but these
enterprises are not specialized in
social media instead social enterprises
are specialized in innovating our
society I mean yeah however we have
difficulties apparently to understand
who social entrepreneurs are and what
they do and that&#39;s a problem because if
we cannot understand who they are in
which challenges they face we cannot
support their role in society and that&#39;s
a problem because the success of social
entrepreneurs is our success because
they innovate our society and need
innovation in our society so we need to
attract people to become social
entrepreneurs and we need to learn how
we can make social entrepreneur
successful but how can we do so if we do
not know whom you&#39;re talking about so
that&#39;s why I&#39;m here I&#39;m here to shed
light on our understanding of social
entrepreneurs and I realized in the last
couple of years that I have difficulties
to convince that social entrepreneurs
are very very important and I realized
that I always did the same mistake I
cannot say or convince anyone that photo
entrepreneurs are very important if I
don&#39;t explain who they are so my first
task today is to explain who social
entrepreneurs are and second I will
review which special challenges social
entrepreneurs face in thirdly I will
explain how we can unlock the potential
of
and why is all of this important because
we need to change than our society and
we need people to work for this so I
brought two stories for you let me
introduce to you Tim and Tom they&#39;ve
started a company that produces bikes
and Tim is an entrepreneur and Tom is a
social entrepreneur so let&#39;s see what
Tim is doing what Tim has always been
very excited about cycling when he was
three years old he learned to ride a
bike and then he had many many bicycle
races in his early childhood and he
wanted to get better in cycling so he
started to produce those bikes on his
own and then he started his studies and
electrical engineering and realized it
would be very interesting to combine
batteries and bicycles and he started to
innovate those biometal batteries better
for the use in bikes and then there were
people saying oh yeah after let&#39;s
effortless bike riding that would be
nice because I don&#39;t like sweating so he
said okay I&#39;m gonna start a company and
this is the model of this company he&#39;s
producing bikes and then give these to
customers who pay him for those bikes
and that&#39;s the business and then he
realized okay that&#39;s working quite nice
and he employed people with brave
mechanical skills to meet his bikes
better so that he could get more
customers and today he is 40 employees
and sells and six countries and Tim is
very happy because he can earn money
with the watch he always wanted to earn
money with which is contracting bikes so
let&#39;s see what his colleague Thomas doin
Tom grew up in an area where there were
just few people who had a bike he
instead plays soccer with his friends
and the kids in this area they had to
walk several kilometers to go to school
and in school the teacher and the
teachers only had a boss and Toph there
were no
books and tom is very interested in
learning and he was lucky because he
received a scholarship so he could go
studying in a big city in his country
and then he did his bachelor&#39;s degree in
psychology and his master&#39;s degree in
business administration and then he was
ready to work and like his fellow
students he had to consider to go abroad
because there were no jobs in his
country but he did not want to go about
he wanted to contribute something in his
hometown so he thought well I want to
mainly use my abilities to change
something in my community and he went
back to his hometown although there were
no jobs at all and then he started to
transmit skills to young people in his
area that graduated senior high school
and that couldn&#39;t find a job and then he
thought well that can&#39;t yet well there
must be more and then he hits into the
idea of producing bikes from bamboo and
thought well that would be very
interesting because there&#39;s bamboos all
around so we could use it and then they
started to produce those pipes and then
he realized these spikes burn much
commercialise yet so we thought well
let&#39;s just sew these bikes to customers
so we can earn money and then he
employed these senior graduates and set
up a company and in all this time his
focus was on the community and he&#39;s
still focusing on employing those people
and transmitting skills to those people
in this area and he&#39;s very happy he has
now 40 employees and he sells his
products and six countries Germany
included and now he can work for he
always wanted to work for the bettering
of his community I met Tom almost two
years ago and his real name is Kwabena
Danzo and he&#39;s the founder of women&#39;s
international I was in Ghana because I&#39;m
part of a project that&#39;s supporting
entrepreneurs in Ghana and we were very
curious how cabina managed to set up a
social business and such very unlikely
circumstances so took us two hours to go
to visit boomers International on
sangeun bumpy roads from the next big
city and that&#39;s what we saw on the left
she sees a storage of the raw material
which is the BAM boom that the company
buys from the farmers in the area and
then you see the production where you
see the young people working there
producing those bike frames and then
that&#39;s me and quite amazed about the
product because I like cycling and just
next to it there&#39;s the accountants
office yeah we were quite amazed seeing
all these things and then a year later
we decided to go back again because we
had new students on board we wanted to
show them what we saw and then again we
were very surprised because remember the
accountants office before here you see
the very same room in here later and it
had to be used as a storage room because
probably enemies used such a great
amount of orders that she had to
transfer them into this room and then it
altered the production site had to be
moved outside and expanded there because
he had those great amount of orders and
it was really amazing to see this
progress because the more bikes were
sold the more people forget unemployment
and the more children could receive good
education because Kwabena did not only
support local people to employ them but
he also had several projects for example
project where he gave out those bikes to
students so that they can rights to the
bike to school and yeah now he explained
us as well that he is producing bike
frames for electric device which is
quite interesting so he&#39;s expanding also
his product range these were two modern
stories that illustrates what social
entrepreneurs and what entrepreneurs
and how they work and over the last
three years I met many tips and tongues
and I&#39;m convinced that they both have a
very very important job
the Tim&#39;s and our world are there to
innovate technology and the tongs in our
world are there to innovate society none
is better than the other we really mean
both for our lives and for our future
however I made a very important
observation our system is rather meant
to reduce Tim&#39;s than Tom&#39;s to reduce
entrepreneurs rather than social
entrepreneurs my first job in university
was to support causes that were there to
explain who Tim&#39;s are what teams do and
how students could learn how to build up
something like Tim and then I asked
myself in a university of 20,000
students or we have great support for
Tim&#39;s for entrepreneurs to come to life
but what about the Tom&#39;s don&#39;t we need
to explain students who Tom&#39;s are what
they do and how they could build
something like Tom so I&#39;ve set out to
develop a concept apply it money and
important partners to offer the first
program at our university to explain to
all students from more disciplines what
Tom&#39;s do who they are and how they could
become Tom but I think that&#39;s not enough
I can&#39;t stop here and I think we can&#39;t
stop here because there the time that I
worked with social entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurs especially social
entrepreneurs face three very important
hurdles and the first one is that
entrepreneurs struggle between two
different groups with very different
interests the one group is the community
social entrepreneurs would like to solve
a problem in the community and the other
part is the customer then needs to solve
a problem for us
otherwise the customer will not pay so
to make this connection and find a match
it&#39;s a very whore and very very
challenging task of social entrepreneurs
and the second is that social
entrepreneurs focus in their business on
bettering the community and that&#39;s very
unusual for banks and investors it&#39;s a
very unusual approach and their metrics
are not meant to fit this approach
because the profit that social
entrepreneurs make is different from the
entrepreneurs so it&#39;s very very
difficult for social entrepreneurs to
get money to start their business and as
well to grow in the business and the
third one is that I realized that there
are many people who do not consider to
become a social entrepreneur because
they do not know that Tom&#39;s exist and
also I discovered that there are people
who have a ton in size so they have the
potential to become social entrepreneurs
but we do not educate them and that&#39;s a
mistake because if we do not educate
those peoples people who are talents to
change our society then we raise the
potential to change our society for the
better and how do we tackle those
problems first we need to widen the
spotlight of our support because we need
to support those entrepreneurs and
social entrepreneurs and that means if
you feel like Tom if you feel like
having a Tom insight you need to learn
how to be like Tom and how to create
something right on how to become a
social entrepreneur so promote Tom&#39;s
becoming Tom and in a society thank you
