good morning and wonderful to be here
this lock stock and barrel or words very
dear to me because basically I&#39;m in the
business of guns and morbid things like
sniping and debt and clearing the scum
from the society and things like that
interestingly
monisha gave you a wonderful beginning
very inspirational there are three
options when you are in a situation like
that one is flight other is fight which
is a better option right of course you
use the barrel and shoot him down or use
your mind as a weapon or use your own
tactics flight is you take stock of the
situation your balance it don&#39;t feel
it&#39;s a third option which is often used
which you people should avoid out of
right you get locked down to the place
interestingly these three words come
from the gun as we know the stock is put
in the crook of the shoulder so that you
can take the recoil of the gun the
barrel is aimed at the target so your
focus and and the lock is the one in
which you push the bullet into the gun
and take your aim so I&#39;ve got 18 minutes
for my bullet I hope I am able to get
somewhere there I am talking about
foul-weather captaincy FWC what does it
mean it&#39;s better to be it as exciting as
being here to be a fowl with a captain
out in the sea when the raging storm and
you have just bypassed an armada of
Pirates and the weather is foul icebergs
ahead and you are not very choppy sea
and you find a rat near your kitchen
store which may be carrying plague very
unusual squeezie guess passengers and a
mutinous mob what does the captain do is
it better to be on this ship or better
to be near they calm Harbor where
suddenly a tsunami may still wipe your
sleep out on a banana peel and without
risk dying or take a risk and face it
that is a question
so for were the captaincy is about the
cops or all the time facing a fall
weather
and that is why the captain had
emergency powers if you are known in
18th century 17th century even up to
19th century and early 20th century the
ship captain had the maximum powers more
than even the president of a country he
could shoot down anybody he had a pistol
called the duck pistol which means duck
foot the pistol had multiple barrels who
can put down the mutiny and shoot many
people he can throw out a piece of cargo
or a human cargo to save the ship that
was the extreme power a captain had but
such powers in a police hierarchy covers
army we have but we have to hold it with
responsibility the cop is in a human
resource manager because he comes across
the scum of the society and the jumps of
society and all the time is handling so
I&#39;m going to pose a small question to
you and I answers are possible it came
out in a business school like yours the
question was your 10-ton truck has to
cross and it is crazy in critical
material which has to reach within a
certain time at certain place and there
is a 10 meter long tunnel or underpass
which it has to cross and the height is
almost 10 feet so in the height of this
vehicle is 10 feet the length is 10
meters the length of the underpass is 10
meters and the situation is a no-go so
10 brilliant people were asked
suggestions and one of them came out of
the simple suggestion how to pass what
could be the suggestion any guess yes
because you people don&#39;t this must have
been part of your study was it part of
your study I am not too sure but one of
you when they told me I also read it
somewhere but a cop who has never been
to a business school a sub-inspector of
police long ago what you did I will tell
you there are two community is going at
each other&#39;s throats fighting for
generation third generation fight going
on to communities they can&#39;t sit
together and there is a temple here and
another temple here belonging to other
community call it mosque call it Church
or whatever now the question is on a
particular day this community says I
want to pass through this this road and
this one says yes you can pass through
but you are carrying a yoke that
religious kind of thing yoke so together
five feet nine inches plus the yoke and
the man jumping you are going to reach
six feet six inches and the tree is
coming like this around that height so
you are going to touch it if you touch
it there
bloodshed we are already with our guns
and swords so sub-inspector is in a
quandary he is not going to get more
reinforcements he has to handle it on
his own
can you guess what he did he didn&#39;t go
to any school but he used he is a man on
the run while on the treadmill thinking
of many things on the fly he came out of
the simple solution previous night he
got the road shaved off by about 1 foot
and the procession went through and even
if the type of jump they would not have
patched it if they&#39;re patched that tree
which is a holy tree coming out of the
other temple there would have been
bloodshed this is the kind of thing
which most of the time there&#39;s the
internal security army does that is why
the cops working with them was a great
pleasure for me I chose this job though
I had an option to be elsewhere and I
did never regretted it I wanted to tell
you the best of leadership I always
found the deep experts were always below
me the deep experience with always below
me and I enjoyed working with them in
the 18 minutes I&#39;m going to condense my
20 years hunt which concluded in 20
seconds in the final encounter and what
is the lesson I carry it from there I
want to convey to you when I went to STF
it was an underdog brand because after
18 years the best the hunt is not over
and people are almost skeptical when I
went there again they have not heard the
word passion mission vision but these
were the guys who are forsaken their
marriage their everything to be within
this small army looking for one man it
was a very unique hunt very difficult
hand and nobody was sure whether they
are going to make it or not it was under
these circumstances I went there and he
went I found three lessons I want to
share with you one was leadership is
found at the bottom so we had an
experiment and we don&#39;t go by the
hierarchy because we have hierarchical
to had bound the hierarchy but I didn&#39;t
go by the hierarchy I broke the rules
what was that I didn&#39;t have enough
sub-inspectors so the next triangles how
old are at constable if you know what is
the Hubble that man with three stripes
you see on the street so we said how
will the gas will become their size
position informally so the selection was
made democratically though democracy is
not allowed in a hierarchical
organization I said democracy here you
six people choose your leader and head
constables among them was chosen and
very very curiously not the toughest man
physically strong or not the man who
uses the most unparliamentary language
not the man who is knowledgeable was
chosen but the man who was silent and
efficient and humble who could carry the
team along calmness tenacity and faith
were the common denominators of all
these head constables who are chosen and
they don&#39;t know to be brilliant second
point you must give your team whatever
team you have because certain things are
inherited certain things are not
negotiable you can&#39;t negotiate for your
mother you can&#39;t ask for a better mother
mother is yours
she&#39;s the best you can ever have
therefore my team my rifle there is a US
Marines at them called the rifle anthem
which I am very fond of I&#39;m not putting
it for the first time it says this is my
rifle
there are many rifles but this one is
mine without me the rifle is useless
without the rifle I am useless so I will
use it well I will keep it clean as a
whistle it goes on and on I will be
strong and clean and I will keep the
rifle strong and clean he&#39;s like my
brother it says so when you inherited a
team I wanted to make it the best of the
team we had many methods of making the
training natural tough and relevant
normally the word entr stays for nothing
to report in our communication our got
communication cliche communication
internal language it&#39;s called nothing to
report but we had everything to report
through these three letters because the
secrecy or the strength behind you our
ability to communicate complex things in
a simple way he is something like
putting a huge training manual into a
visiting card size we should be able to
convey through acronyms simple ideas
this simple idea of making NTR
converted into what is called 1-minute
drills
one minute drills came to me the
inspiration came to me from one minute
manager which have read long time ago
that is a relevance of reading books and
getting ideas from others these days
from the Google you can get the gist of
ideas from so many sources multiple
sources so if you want to read Russian
literature you want to get passionate
about it at least go through some
experts of Russian literature then you
will find even warrant piece of Leo
Tolstoy relevant how a description of a
platform and a railway station for 27
pages he is able to go on and on you
can&#39;t find better literature than that
so you&#39;ve got the ability today at a
click of a button to go anywhere and
remotely read so coming back to my
1-minute drills one minute drills can be
anything you can device without any cost
cost less or less cost training is very
important you as the Future Leaders when
you go instead of asking for big
resources what with scanty resources
what you can do on this part with what
you have and what we&#39;ll have as a team
whether you have put the best energy
into him the best zest in him the best
the quest for excellence like what
Manish was mentioning have you put it
that is a question instead of saying all
the time I have not received this so my
team became really really stronger and
we are no more the underdog our
instructors gave the tough love and
today if we go to the airport you will
find the people are checking the tickets
that one minute drill has been adopted
by our winner engine when he was DJ CSF
from one of the duels I suggested that I
am not blaming appropriately for all
this because ideas are not cannot be
part of the intellectual property ideas
can travel like air but ideas like air
boost your morale boost your energy
boost your efficiency but a trainer
unless he is worried entered and focused
on what to train and how to make the
team better it will be something
tantamount to great training robbery you
will be training on the relevant things
and very with too much of concepts and
without giving him the ability to be
practical so it doesn&#39;t flee the scene
he stands behind and fights and it
doesn&#39;t get frozen in in action so I
mentioned to your board so simplify the
training the last part plus
number three was that sulk crib but come
out of it fall but rise
Monsieur thing mentioned about falling
rise fall and rise again and I think
Steve Kawai mentions about it&#39;s not a
question of not falling he fall six
times but whether you have got up on the
seventh is the important point
without dips there are no apps without
valleys there are no hills there will be
aha moments and poops movements
everywhere I remembered three people
whenever I was in trouble I&#39;m not a
Christian but I just read book of Job
when I was depressed book of Job J will
be is a thing which can inspire any one
of you for any religion anywhere if you
read if you can find a man can be at the
pits and still he can rise will feel oh
this is nothing next book I loved I keep
once and a while reading not a full book
at least the paragraphs I keep a gist of
every book I read otherwise I don&#39;t read
a book if I read a book I go prod I
plunge I get into it deep and it will
not miss even a single word otherwise a
book is not worth keeping and they don&#39;t
own a single book in my library all my
books are begged borrowed or stolen even
but I sincerely existed and then return
the book second book I loved was Viktor
Frankl I don&#39;t nobody ever thought of
this chap called Viktor we a kto are FR
n KL meaning of life what was he he was
a lecturer conceiving an understanding
when he was sitting in the cab when he
was about to be executed probably his
wife has been taken away a daughter has
been already sent to the gas chamber
under the Nazi camp he is waiting on the
death row his turn is coming next before
that every day he says I am going to be
released I am going to come out when I
come out this is the lecture format this
is the lecture I am going to give on
psychology perhaps 20 minutes lecture 30
minutes lecture he formatted the lecture
and when he came out indeed he delivered
the lecture in a manner he wanted I was
stunned to read about a golf
golfer he became a golfer not a
professional a man who played golf after
17 years in Vietnam as a prisoner of war
when he was president of war all the
time he was doing was how to play how to
make the swing how to stand what posture
to adopt how to get the tea
and everything every day thousand
sometimes he was imagining or imagining
whatever it is when he came out he was a
brilliant golfer imagine he was holding
on to just a read the tenacious small
bit of ray of hope grab it so when you
are in trouble when you are depressed
when you are down and out sulk but make
it the trigger off your next success I
basically followed three principles even
today I look at for inspiration I look
at men who are older and fitter than me
I don&#39;t find many people older than me
what a fitter that combination it&#39;s a
diminishing group small group which
means I am also levitating edging or
weighing up that&#39;s okay
I look at older Peter man and get
inspired by him as for my physical
fitness is concerned I look at people
with better endowments better
intelligence better emotional questions
better IQ everything but not so
privileged not so well placed then I
look at him and say how lucky I am how
fortunate I am third thing I do is when
I am down and out I look out and look at
the people who are in real misery and
trouble and still sporting a smile with
his three lessons which I told you
earlier that anything is yours look at
the hierarchy and leadership is below
and like somebody said there is lot of
leadership today and this leader is
telling what they need is a follower and
in humility the leader is becoming the
follower and learning things from them
that humility you have that ketosis
catalyst ET openness humbleness you are
bound to be greater and grow and grow
and more second point I told you make
the training training doesn&#39;t mean
formal training classroom training or
any outdoor training training means
preparing the mind for a contingency for
a new situation to meet the uncertainty
of
whether captain willingly of your own
volition and deliberately and the third
point I told you look around and see
himself but out of the cell you look at
people like job Viktor Frankl Jack sands
and then come out of the cell and always
remember there are better people out
there but you&#39;re bored like you to be
here from here you rise more and more
and spread that goodness down below and
finally down and out but look out and
interestingly when we are trying this my
rifle thing I told you I must end with
that slightly not so serious anecdote so
we got some pangolins pangolins or ant
hitters and we saw some hunters coming
with the pangolins
and behind the hunter was a very humble
looking dogs they were all the hunted
dogs so we grabbed the hunters we
grabbed the dogs and I tried to put them
into my STF STF stands for special task
force so in the special transpose when
they were recruited and these hunters
were sent inside the prisons the dog
became our property and immediately the
efficiency rate of the dog declined
within or denied the dog which was doing
so well in private enterprise in public
enterprise like I was declined so this
is on the lighter note but here again
the problem was the separation of the
dog from its master that was traumatic
we should have we didn&#39;t have an option
that time but I&#39;m just saying when you
separate certain things from where it
belongs
you are uprooting and you&#39;re creating
cataclysm paroxysm chaos and you should
be as a whole whether captain have the
ability to handle that chaos so to be
certain of only one thing that is
uncertainty and to be certain that you
will be able to handle it is the prime
quality of a foul weather captain and I
believe all of you are going to be
followed by the captain&#39;s that we need
more and more guys like you guys
includes the ladies too and I&#39;m
extremely delighted to be in your meds
this morning to convey it is one final
bullet that you can and you are already
there thank you
you
[Applause]
