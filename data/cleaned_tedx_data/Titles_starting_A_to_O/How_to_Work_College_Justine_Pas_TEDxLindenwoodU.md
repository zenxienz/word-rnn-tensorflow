few of us really know how college works
I know this from my own experience as a
college student and now a college
professor it seems that every job out
there now requires a college diploma and
we think the point of college is that
piece of paper called a diploma so we
have to go to college to get a job and
we think that all we need to do while in
college is raised to the finish line to
get that diploma now I know about the
rising cost of education I also know
that many of us race through college to
keep those costs to a minimum but and
this is very important when all we do is
race to the Diploma we lose out on what
College has to offer and end up not even
getting what we paid for an education
now I am no exception in the race to the
Diploma it&#39;s exactly what I did when I
went to college I went to college
because that&#39;s what I was supposed to do
I took classes and met the requirements
because that&#39;s what I was supposed to do
I earned a diploma because that&#39;s what I
was supposed to do the entire time I was
convinced the point of it all was that
college degree which would then just
magically push open doors to really
exciting and very well-paying
opportunities I had no idea how college
was supposed to work I was what experts
in education call a non-traditional
college student I was an immigrant from
a working-class family I didn&#39;t speak a
word of English just six years before
starting college and I graduated at the
ripe old age of 28 for me not knowing
how college worked meant that I studied
for the test and forgot most of what I
learned when the semester ended I just
did when my professors told me and
rarely showed initiative or asked
questions about my classes I figured it
would all become clear when the diploma
landed on the wall
and while my GPA and my diploma looked
as if I had actually succeeded
I failed my education in a really
fundamental way I never saw my classes
as opportunities I needed to take active
advantage of instead I saw them as hoops
I had to jump through before starting my
career I saw them as obstacles between
me and my future so I ended up paying
for busy work instead of paying for an
education as a result I still often feel
like a strange sort of creature I&#39;ve
gone from not knowing the first thing
about college and having to spend many
postgraduate years figuring it out to
teaching students who may be just as
clueless as I was now looking at college
college classes as obstacles is rather
common for those of us from backgrounds
where education isn&#39;t a given we come to
college but we&#39;re not prepared for it
and we don&#39;t understand what people want
from us we don&#39;t feel entitled to
college and were confused about the
point of it all I was an immigrant who
knew next to nothing about higher
education and a first-generation college
student who could not navigate college
whose family could not help navigate
college or even help me do so
financially I didn&#39;t know how to talk to
my professors I didn&#39;t know there was a
difference between adjunct instructors
and tenured professors I didn&#39;t know why
I had to take classes outside of my
major sometimes I was even afraid to
approach my professors I didn&#39;t really
see them as regular human beings to me
there were people who had it all figured
out there were the keepers of knowledge
which I had no right to question I
thought my job as a student was to pass
my classes and let the Diploma do the
rest now in the face of it and I&#39;d be
the first to admit it
College works in mysterious the
bureaucratic ways there are also many
different ways to make sense
of what it offers one thing however is
absolutely certain diplomas are less
important than what they stand for they
are less important than the knowledge
skills and experience we gain as we work
to earn them so today I&#39;d like to offer
10 tips for how to make the most out of
college 10 equally important tips to
help ensure that when diplomas land on
your walls they actually stand for the
new things you learn and the old things
you learned to do better 1 don&#39;t sign up
for classes because you&#39;ve heard they&#39;re
easy stay away from easy classes if you
see them coming run the other way if you
think you&#39;re a terrible writer take
classes where you have to write all the
time if you&#39;re afraid of public speaking
take Speech and Debate classes if you
can&#39;t make sense of statistical data
take a math class take the fool take the
fullest possible advantage of every
single class to improve yourself and
your skills even when you don&#39;t see how
these classes are related to anything
you&#39;re doing right now a lot of what we
learn in college becomes obvious only
much later in our careers and on a
second related point learn to think
critically solve complex problems and
design solutions study to become a
professional adult employers aren&#39;t
looking for job robots to mechanically
perform assigned tasks they need
creative and innovative people who work
as part of the team 3 learn how to learn
take classes that will teach you how to
absorb and manage new information it&#39;s a
surprise for us for those of us who
think diplomas get jobs but the
knowledge and skills we develop are
usually more important than what we
major in now there are some pre
professional majors where decision
necessarily the case but statistics show
that generally speaking there&#39;s not much
connection between your majors and the
various jobs you will have over the
course of your careers for get to know
your peers and your professors these
don&#39;t have to be people on your majors
find those who are willing to listen and
understand what you&#39;re going through
fyz connect with faculty mentors don&#39;t
wait for someone to be assigned to you
seek out professors whose teaching and
personalities inspire you chances are
you will end up with more than one
mentor and their combined advice will
help guide your education and they&#39;ll be
very glad to write your recommendations
6 don&#39;t believe the hype there are
stupid questions but when these
questions come out of a genuine
curiosity they&#39;ll help you learn don&#39;t
be afraid of being embarrassed or wrong
the best kind of learning happens
through trial and error college is the
perfect time and place to practice what
I call the who cares mantra someone
laughs who cares shake it off and move
on 7 don&#39;t study for the test study to
make the information your own learn how
to value knowledge for its own sake
study to better understand yourself the
people around you and the world we live
in
think about what you&#39;re learning discuss
it in class argue with your friends
about it when knowledge becomes our own
no exam will be difficult and you will
carry it with you into the future 8
study foreign languages all of us need
to know how to navigate the multilingual
and multicultural world we live in
studying a foreign language will help
you learn about other cultures and it
will improve your proficiency in English
it will also make you stand out on the
job market 9 do internships employers
look for self-motivated knowledgeable
and experienced candidates
almost every college has a Career Center
go there early and often to find out how
they can help now my tenth and final
observation might be just a little bit
controversial there is no such thing as
a boring professor part of my job is to
review course evaluations as you might
imagine students opinions about their
professors are all over the place but
they all have something in common the
same student who thinks that one
professor is boring enough to put her to
sleep it&#39;s it&#39;s the same professors then
praised by another student as
life-changing now I&#39;ve read enough of
these evaluations to know this has a lot
to do with students interest and
investment in what they study in my very
very long and very labor-intensive
journey from not knowing how college
works to becoming a college professor I
learned something very important when we
believe that what we are learning is our
own to make sense of our own to use and
our own to challenge we won&#39;t need to
have entertaining professors don&#39;t
forget people not college diplomas get
jobs start careers and live meaningful
lives
