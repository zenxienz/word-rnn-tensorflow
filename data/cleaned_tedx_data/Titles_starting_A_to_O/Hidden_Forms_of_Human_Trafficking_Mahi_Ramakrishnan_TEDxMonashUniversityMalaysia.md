I&#39;m here today to talk to you about
trafficking or rather the hidden hands
of trafficking the consequences of
trafficking and the lives that it
continues to destroy in 2001 while I was
working for Time magazine I was asked by
my bosses to do an investigative piece
on the unsmiling route in Southeast Asia
they wanted me to look at the main
supplier or suppliers the buyers the
sellers and also to investigate if the
different militant groups in Southeast
Asia was also buying weapons from the
same supplier it took me a few months of
research as well as investigation to
find out that the biggest supplier of
weapons at that time in 2001 was the
Royal Thai Army and I had to work with a
Malaysian arms smuggler called in in
order to be able to see an arms
transaction so that I can write a first
person&#39;s account for Time magazine as
opposed to of course they finding the
easier way which is to interview them
and then to write the article
now Dean and I had to come up with a
story as to why I was following him into
the llaman army camp to buy a weapon so
this is the story we came out with we
were supposed to tell that my husband
was having an affair and I was going to
buy a gun to shoot the girlfriend dead
or maybe to shoot the husband there I
can&#39;t really remember but we strategized
we fixed the date and I flew in to Kota
Bharu Kuantan and took a taxi in to
serve I go look we waited for 48 hours
before a military representative came to
fetch both Din and myself to the Yama
army camp where he was where he has been
dealing for more than 10 years when we
got there the colonel who saw me was
totally upset he started screaming
anybody so angry with did but then
started waving around cash greenbacks
year&#39;s dollars and he started buying
more weapons and
also placed orders for ammunitions
grenades Smith &amp; Wesson&#39;s and Browning&#39;s
and that kind of pacified the colonel
so once the transaction was done we left
on the way back to Senegal Oh didn&#39;t got
a phone call and then he told me that he
needed to leave earlier than expected
because he had to get back to Chiang Mai
the very next day to bring a group of
young girls to cater to the needs of
Malaysian men very old Malaysian men who
believed that having sex with young
girls will make sure that they lived
longer and that they will not get HIV or
AIDS now at that time in 2001 the word
trafficking was so rare it was not
common at all so I looked at Dinh as an
armed smuggler and not a trafficker
fast forward to six years I was asked by
dr. hartney Zinedine the very famous
child rights advocate based in Kuala
Lumpur to do a story on baby trafficking
she told me specifically that I needed
to get footage of the sales happening so
that she can use that to lobby for
better enforcement with the police I
agree it was a nightmare it took me more
than one and a half years to finish the
film because it took me more than a year
to finally get hold of a baby trafficker
who agreed to speak to me he told me
that the traffic is operated a certain
way and that is to go looking for
absolutely poor vulnerable people whom
they can then exploit and it will be
easier if the couple already have two or
three children because then it&#39;s easier
to persuade them to let go of their
babies so this is the strategy and the
minute I identify them and the minute
the woman agrees to sell the baby they
take the baby away and the money is
delivered on the spot now they also told
me that they had to cater for increasing
demand and so they came up with baby
farms baby farms are worked solely by
modern workers it could be any migrant
worker that you know from your
stick help to anyone a woman who agrees
to become a surrogate mother and the
minute she agrees the traffickers will
go around looking for good-looking men
because good-looking men equals
good-looking babies and babies
particularly baby boys who are fair
skinned with almond shaped eyes will
fetch a way higher price than a tan
complexioned baby now it&#39;s not true to
say that all of these babies who are
sold who are trafficked and sold to
adoptive parents will end up in a bad
way that&#39;s not true at all because yes
we do know of many cases where they have
good access to education and a better
life but there are also many more who
end up being dumped back into the
adoption ring into the adoption process
now how does this happen when the child
is about 4 or 5 years old the parents
the adoptive parents will pick out the
fact that they may have mental emotional
or even physical challenges and any form
of chronic illness when they find that
out the first thing they do is to take
the baby to take the four-year-old child
and to dump the child back into the
adoption process now according to the
trafficker
it&#39;s impossible to resell a 4 or a 5
year old child because it&#39;s so much more
easier to sell a baby so what do you
think happens to these children who are
dumped back anyone has an idea
exactly the children are then sold into
the child sex trade or they are absorbed
by the begging syndicates both in
Malaysia and in Thailand in Thailand
it&#39;s absolutely horrific because they
maim the children the limbs are broken
either the legs or the hands are broken
so that they elicit more sympathy as
they go out begging on the streets now
when we talk about the child sex
industry I&#39;m not just talking about the
child sex industry in Thailand or
Cambodia
I&#39;m also talking about the child sex
industry in Malaysia now how many of you
know that there is a child sex industry
in Malaysia please put up your hands
nice I&#39;m so glad that I can see a few
hands seven years ago I did an
investigative film to expose the child
sex industry in Malaysia again for dr.
hearty needs I didn&#39;t who said that it
was literally impossible to convince
anyone that there is a child sex
industry so we needed evidence we needed
proof it took me two and a half years to
complete the film because it took me two
years to find the children I eventually
found three one was from Indonesia the
other one was from Thailand and the
third girl was from India now for the
purpose of this talk I&#39;m going to call
her Maya Maya was 13 years old when she
was brought in to Malaysia she told me
that life was relatively good for her in
India because her father was working so
there was money for food there was money
for rental and she and both the siblings
were able to go to school but all that
came to an abrupt halt when the father
had a heart attack and died leaving the
mother completely stranded
she had no education and no skills she
had never worked before
so after a few months the family had no
money for food rental and all the
children had to stop schooling now it
was at this time that the trafficker
approached them and told the mother that
Maya had a way better life in Malaysia
working as a domestic health and earning
1000
500 ringgit a month and 1500 ringgit
translate into 20,000 rupees in India
and that&#39;s a lot of money for Maya&#39;s
family so Maya&#39;s mother reluctantly sent
her to Malaysia when she got here she
was locked up in a room for 4 days
straight and after the fourth day the
guy took her out for lunch in brick
fields and Maya told me that a few
minutes into eating she felt very dizzy
and absolutely weak in the body
she was taken back to her room and she
told me that even though she was in a
daze a few men raped her that day after
which she was sold into the child sex
trade in August this year I premiered a
film on Rohingya child brides Rahim Yar
girls who are as young as 11 to 15 years
old who are trafficked and sold to
Rohini Amman in Malaysia who buy them
for 7,000 to 8,500 we get anywhere in
between that is already a lot of money
for them but they rather the other they
either make a deal with the trafficker
or get money which they borrow from
their family and friends in order to pay
and buy a child rights now I&#39;m sure many
of you know what is happening in Burma
the targeted persecution against the
Rohingya has led to the eggs orders of
more than half a million Rohingya from
Burma to Bangladesh
now Bangladesh is especially Cox&#39;s Bazar
in Bangladesh is the place that the
traffic is are zooming in on now an
interview with the trafficker early this
year revealed that there is a new
trafficking route from Malaysia to
Bangladesh where these children are
brought in and this is how it works the
Bangladeshi traffic is in Bangladesh
will forge the passports of these young
girls wait until they get about eight to
ten goals together fly with them into a
polygon for International Airport bright
the Malaysian immigration officer
and bring the children into the country
now these children are sold not for
seven or eight thousand five hundred
ringgit these children are sold for
sixteen thousand bring it as some way
beyond the means of the Rohingya now
this raises the question as to who the
buyers are and where these children are
going chances are they are being sold
into the Malaysian child sex industry as
well as into tie line as well so if we
take a step back and look at all these
stories we will understand the
trafficking is absolutely lucrative it
runs into billions and billions of
dollars and that it&#39;s so interlinked
that there is a dizzyingly complex chain
of people who move in and out of
trafficking rings and in a way they are
all connected people not just me but any
other journalist or filmmaker who works
on challenging issues such as
trafficking will have to face the
consequences there&#39;s no running away
from it when then and I worked together
I made it very clear to date that I was
a journalist working for Time magazine
and that the story will be carried in
the Time magazine publication I told him
to promise me that he will never ever go
back to the Yala army camp ever again
but that that was the end of it
he promised me unfortunately two weeks
after the story was published he went
back to Thailand he was killed then the
Interpol called my boss and said that I
had to leave the country because it
wasn&#39;t safe for me anymore I was torn
because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling
that I was responsible for Dale&#39;s death
even though he knew what he was getting
into and also I had to leave my children
in Malaysia and go back home to India
where my dad comes from my son was 12 at
that time and my daughter was five I had
to leave both of them and I had panic
and anxiety because I was really afraid
for their safety when I was doing the
baby
trafficking story we did the interview
with the trafficker anonymously I shot
him in silhouette which means you will
never be able to see his face and also
because sometimes the police or their
you know other enforcement they will
come and ask us to give them the tapes
so what I did was I made sure that
throughout the entire duration of
filming it
we never filmed his face so that we can
give them anything that they asked for
and they will never be able to see the
face of the trafficker despite that at
the end of the interview the trafficker
told me that if anyone found out his
identity he will traffic my daughter
across the border and sell her into the
sex trade I was terrified because I
didn&#39;t tell him anything about myself so
obviously he had done his homework and
he knew I had a daughter I was worried
that he may know where we lived I was
worried that he may even know my
daughter&#39;s movements I also did a story
on migrant trafficking 4yb Charles
Santiago who is the opposition member of
parliament for clanked that evening I
had scheduled and impendent
and then bought an interview with the
trafficker but in the morning I had to
rush out because I had a corporate video
to film I left the house ten minutes
later I told myself oh my god I&#39;ve
forgotten something really important so
I went back home it took an entire 20
minutes and I went home open the door
and saw the house completely ransacked
every drawer was open all my clothes
were on the floor but nothing valuable
was taken except for my laptop my laptop
back and my laptop charger now people
always ask me if I get scared and the
owners answer is I get terrified really
terrified and I have to until today live
with the consequences of having made
decisions to work on extremely
challenging stories such as trafficking
but I do that because of one thing I
hold on to the absolute
unshakeable belief that these stories
need to be told that these stories need
to be put out there there all of you
should have access to what&#39;s actually
happening in the world of trafficking
the devastation that it causes in
people&#39;s lives this is crucial to me and
it&#39;s also important because it allows
for stakeholders such as NGOs civil
society organizations parliamentarians
enforcement officers to either look at
existing anti-trafficking law or to do
better networking in terms of the region
in order to try and nip trafficking
activities now I&#39;m sure that all of you
at some point in your life will face
crippling fear and just like me I hope
that every one of you here will be able
to find and hold on to that one thing
which will allow you to move on which
will allow you to follow your heart and
your passion
