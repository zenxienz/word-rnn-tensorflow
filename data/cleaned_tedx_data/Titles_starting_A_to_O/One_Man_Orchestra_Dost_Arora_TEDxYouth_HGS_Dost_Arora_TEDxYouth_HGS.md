no matter where you born or how old we
are music is a part of our lives and we
all understand it we are all born
musically I am told that as a baby
whenever I heard some music I would just
start tapping my fingers on my hand grew
a little older I started doing the same
on a table my mother thought that she
had given birth to the next socket was
am sure he got it table for me I was
just four I was so excited to get a new
toy but everything changed when she
decided to give me a teacher the teacher
asked me to practice one hour every day
and started my formal training all of a
sudden a very interesting toy that
produced fascinating sounds became a
very boring one I didn&#39;t like it anymore
so after just three classes before the
teacher would come I would sneak out of
the house disappear and I never saw him
again he was obviously very very angry
so he told my mother I think your son is
tone deaf I&#39;m not sure if he can learn
the table I wonder now what if instead
of trying to teach me he would have just
let me play what I wanted she only
sounds that a child could relate to say
for example a horse running on the road
running on the field
faster faster

thank you my first performance was at
the age of six but that was by an
accident in my first standard my
classroom was very near to the music
room so every time I heard some music I
started playing it on my desk one day
while crossing the music room I saw no
one was there so I went inside and I
started playing the conga the same beats
I used to hear every day all of a sudden
the teacher was back I was frightened
but something amazing happened she
wasn&#39;t angry she was pleased in five
days later I was performing at my
school&#39;s annual function with my school
orchestra where everyone else was from
the senior classes then I was always a
part of my school band playing the Bongo
of the Congo but the big change came
when my father was posted to Jaipur I
was 12 the new music teacher said to me
see I don&#39;t need another Congo player I
have plenty in the line who can play the
Congo but I kept going back to him again
and again and again so he finally said
okay okay if you can somehow learn to
play the drums I&#39;ll take you I don&#39;t
mind another drummer well I had no
choice so I borrowed sticks from my
teacher I started observing how the
drummer used to play what he used to do
and then I used to go home just on the
floor practice on the wall on the dining
table everywhere I had no drums at home
slowly slowly I became a drama
substitute then the main drama then one
day my school needed someone to play the
keyboard in the morning assembly I
Wallington
my brother had a very small gas here at
home which was gifted to him on his
birthday and sometimes I used to play
you&#39;re not very easy songs twinkle
twinkle little star happy birthday but
that&#39;s when I really got serious I
wanted to play in the assembly
so I started juicing hard and I was
playing in the assembly then one day my
school needed someone who could play the
table in the school Ramlila and guess
who again volunteer remember that table
that my mother bought when I was 4 I
started playing it again I can&#39;t be
grateful enough to my school music
teacher Aaron sir collect me experiment
with different instruments who let me be
me now when I look back I realized that
subconsciously maybe bad the beginning
of me becoming a multi-instrumentalist
and that is when it developed a
curiosity in me for different sounds so
whenever I could pick up another
instrument I would pick up and start
experimenting with it for example the
influence on the beginning the pan flute
I just got it from Europe a few months
back I was also in Dubai couple of years
back for a performance and there I saw
this beautiful instrument there bucha I
started playing it let me show you how
it sounds
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you
fortunately or unfortunately I don&#39;t
know now how to look at it but I never
got a chance to learn music formally so
I learned very very naturally to love
sounds and once I loved some sound
I wanted to create it myself whether it
was classical or popular Indian or
Western I used to listen to different
artists different instruments and then
try they liked them I feel today I can
play multiple instruments because I was
never tied up in rules music men freedom
to express myself music is not science
there are no human lives at risk
music is creativity so how can
creativity have boundaries instruments
like flute sitar and tabla are thought
of as pure classical music instruments I
like to play them a little differently
I play classical as well
but I also like to experiment so first
the flute I&#39;ll play something for you
classical rock hands money then I&#39;ll
play something western popular and let
you guess which one it is
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
now I&#39;ll play the sitar first I&#39;ll click
Halle in a classical rock called beam
policy then I&#39;ll play a little bit of
Michael Jackson and end rock guitar this
is not a very comfortable position to
play and I&#39;ll try my best
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you now I&#39;ll play the violin I&#39;ll
play a very popular Bollywood party song
[Music]
well what must be wondering how did a
person with a master&#39;s degree in
economics decide to quit his job and
become a musician since my childhood I
followed the only path shown to me by my
teachers parents and society to be
successful
I worked extremely hard at school I
talked my high school I went to the best
you never for the best god of course and
I got campus place to one of the best
Diamond Seas of the world done settled
and I was supposed to be happy for the
rest of my life but guess what I wasn&#39;t
happy after a few months of working I
felt like I was just existing not living
and how can an unhappy person call
himself successful by the time I got
back home from office I was so exhausted
I couldn&#39;t do music music had just
disappeared from my life that&#39;s when I
realized the importance of music I had
to do something
music one just use a hobby anymore so I
decided to quit my job I didn&#39;t become a
musician to be rich or famous I did it
to be something more than that to be
happy I feel if you can be happy and are
able to earn a decent living you&#39;re the
most successful person on this planet
all I can say is I stopped learning
economics the day I left college I never
went to a music school but I&#39;m learning
music every day that&#39;s the beauty of
doing what you love I feel so fortunate
to be born in a country like India with
such
music in culture every state from Punjab
Rajasthan Maharashtra has its own beats
its own music so how can I finish today
without showing you a folk dargah so
let&#39;s finish the mashup of different
folk
