lovely be here tonight quite symbolic
actually they were all selling
installment with no government to speak
off with such wonderful speakers and
such intelligence and when Elizabeth was
talking about her pride years of her
country I was thinking about her pride
we all are of Northern Ireland and what
would be our equivalent to your bridge
it was probably this place but it&#39;s just
not working at the moment but we&#39;ll get
there
so on to my story walking down Royal
Avenue in Belfast I saw a little stall
with pictures there was pictures of
Harland and Wolff&#39;s pictures off you
know the carrick-a-rede rope bridge the
pictures that the tourist stop and buy
from the cruise ships the black hedges
weren&#39;t there because at that stage they
weren&#39;t famous in the back I saw this
picture and it touched me I quietly
asked how much was it and I put up my
bag and covered it up and I brought it
home and I put it in a dine stirrers
bathroom and nobody would see it I don&#39;t
know why I did that
but I did that this picture is off a
chair with a chi m to the wall the
prisons in northern ireland and the 70s
were full of chairs like this if you
were a child visiting a prison this is
the chair you sat on I was a child
visiting a prison this is the chair i
sat on I&#39;ve said it how many people in
Northern Ireland in the early 1970s were
the children of prisoners the prison
population without 400 percent in the
late 60s early 70s but we don&#39;t hear
about these children we hear a lot about
the prisoners are locked indeed many of
them roam these halls but what of those
children I know some and they don&#39;t tell
people and they&#39;re across all society my
first job after University was to go
work with a probation service
what better job could I have I was quite
passionate about rehabilitation and
helping people and I find that when I
went into my job there were two groups
or prisoners there were the ODC s and
there were what we called the politicals
and some people called the terrorists
the Oh DC&#39;s ordinary decent criminal
they were the rapist the burglars all of
those people that didn&#39;t have a
political crime where the OD sees as I
read the files I couldn&#39;t believe was
some of the stuff that I read right
across all of the files I have to say
bit traumatized they&#39;re really young
offenders and oh my those young
offenders I struggled when I read the
files to find one just one that had a
decent home a decent upbringing every
one of them had something that had
happened to them they might have been
filled at school if not by their family
but there was always something that led
to them to the place that they ended up
and I loved my job my boss was great and
I got promoted
I bought this we hice 108 Balfour Avenue
to on the lower armor Road it&#39;s all I
could afford
I play classical music and I painted the
walls and thought maybe I was becoming
what I always wanted to be a
professional person breakthrough be
something special be something better my
boss called me in and said the whole
team is moving inside of the prison to
do our rehabilitation
I was excited I&#39;d already been promoted
I&#39;d given up my masters because he
wanted me to do the full-time job
yes you&#39;re not coming me I&#39;m not coming
not better than everybody here why why
not coming don&#39;t worry dear it&#39;s nothing
to do with you it&#39;s because of where
you&#39;re from and who you really added to
I packed up my car two weeks later and I
went to London twenty-two years of age
heartbroken absolutely still heartbroken
how could that happen in our society how
could we ask people to move forward how
could we ask people to work together be
together and treat people like that
who was doing this why I didn&#39;t do
anything all I ever wanted was the best
for everyone I went to university and I
had friends whose dads when they are you
see I made friends English friends whose
parents have been soldiers here I made
friends across the page me we didn&#39;t
care where we were from we cared about
what our moral compass was who we were
guess what it isn&#39;t all bad I had a
fantastic career you know when you go
somewhere else all they care about is
how good you are they don&#39;t care about
what your address was they don&#39;t care
about who you&#39;re related to they don&#39;t
care about anything else they want to
know guess what what are you putting on
the bottom line is my company well guess
what ladies and gents that wasn&#39;t that
difficult for me
I was hard-working I was ambitious I had
something driving me something bigger
and maybe maybe maybe it was the chance
there was always something no matter how
well I did I worked all over a year it
got boring I wanted to be home has three
little children I&#39;m one of them&#39;s here
and I decided to bring them back to this
godforsaken place that I love and I
brought them back at my gorgeous English
husband to this it was 2012 and it was
the flag protest and I thought oh my god
what have I done
what have I done I thought our society
had moved forward oh no and I started to
try and understand what was going on
within unionist culture and I thought
rather than set up the Malone Road with
a very nice salary keep myself to myself
keep my kids in a good grammar school
maybe it&#39;s time I did something instead
of complaining about politicians so I
did didn&#39;t I
did my ladies and gentlemen I did
something
but as you&#39;re starting to see my story
doesn&#39;t always end well I tried to be
the bridge between two men but that&#39;s a
whole other TED talk an IEEE 21 fresh
politics we got the kids involved we
have a social media strategy and I
worked my socks off I worked harder than
anybody and I was running my own little
company sponsored by a PLC there were
four of us in a little office and the
Scottish problem building by sitting all
they&#39;d left their jobs to come and work
for me
they knew me I had a responsibility I
was gonna build something big but I was
gonna work every night at building this
party as well a journalist called me and
he said I want to hear your story
so of course just like all this I talked
about and did you know I won this award
and did you know I built this and did
you know I&#39;m back because I love this
place and this is the article II printed
my lovely English husband said darling
what&#39;s worse being a West Belfast car
but the unionist chief title or being
someone in business called an IRA man&#39;s
daughter
what is worse and I said I don&#39;t know
what&#39;s worse but we&#39;re leaving I&#39;m
already here
does anybody here know what time you can
get a newspaper in Northern Ireland
because the twelve o&#39;clock in Midnight
in November and 2013 the article come up
on the web and it says continued on page
four and five
what and on page 45 they worked a time
the future of Northern Ireland because
it&#39;s people like me that can overcome
their bridges that need to be encouraged
but this is what they put on the front
page I was done or so I thought
something changed that day in me and I
hope to god it happens to you if it
hasn&#39;t already I decided that I would
stay and I would fear sit and I would
fight it and I would prove to anyone who
wanted to knock me
that they weren&#39;t going to and this is
what I would teach my children not to be
chained to anything we&#39;re all chained to
something but each link that we build is
our bridge to who we are whether you&#39;re
in poverty in Northern Ireland and two
hundred thousand people right now today
or ill are sick have mental health
issues children are growing up is that
there is stigma everywhere in this place
you can feel it you can smell it you
walk into the schools there in the areas
that don&#39;t have a lot
those kids are stigmatized mousses kids
don&#39;t stand a chance
Deirdre Heenan will tell you but it is
free we can tell in Northern Ireland
who&#39;s not gonna make it at age three
because of poverty we&#39;re all chance or
something and we all have a
responsibility that when we get
somewhere that we help somebody along
helped them build their chin have them
step out of their chair it&#39;s been great
it&#39;s been great
wow I&#39;m glad I stayed I built three
multi-million pound companies I&#39;ve heard
five thousand people like to work every
day across this island
me and my team not just me of course I&#39;m
just lucky I&#39;m surrounded by such talent
and more than that more than any of that
I now run the visitor centers across
these prisons I do the child of a
prisoner these are the toys but I wanted
to give in the prisons because it&#39;s way
too rubbish but the children aren&#39;t
sitting on the chairs i sat on everyone
has a chain everyone is a choice
everyone is a responsibility looking
around the world today at the levels
that are on people at the judgements we
make whether it&#39;s Isis whatever it is we
judge everybody those people afforded
for Trump or judging them all judging
people enough is enough to send them the
wrong way
so Who am I what label do I give myself
I&#39;m a mother first and foremost I&#39;m a
wife I&#39;m a businesswoman I&#39;m an
entrepreneur but ladies and gentlemen
I&#39;m also a prisoner&#39;s daughter and I&#39;m
not ashamed thank you
you
