none of my ten or eleven year old
students are ordinary and and II
certainly wasn&#39;t either he was one of
the most talented students I&#39;ve had in
my 23 years in education before he
entered my class the kid had built his
own computer from salvaged parts he and
I would have regular academic
conversations after school about world
issues scientific breakthroughs and we
debate as well with all that was going
for Andy he had troubles troubles
connecting with his peers it was my goal
to help him when I signed Andy and a few
other students a research project around
the age of European exploration of the
Americas I felt so confident that this
would help him shine students were to
become explorers for a mock news
conference that would broadcast on skype
for other classrooms to watch I thought
it might be a project that could help
him connect with his peers and I
imagined that that online audience might
even juice with such vigor they would
have get Andy&#39;s classmates to look at
him in a new light
so picture my classroom 33 10 or 11 year
old students split into two groups some
as reporters and others dressed up as
famous Europeans who explored the world
in the 1516 and 1700s
Andy was amongst the group acting as
explorers and he was ready to be
interviewed his costume was a taped on
black paper beard his hat looked like it
was from the Renaissance era his
identity as Fernand and Magellan
credited was circumnavigating the globe
even though he didn&#39;t make it himself
was a secret to the rest of the students
they needed to find out who he was
through their questions
Andy step to the microphone for his turn
class is watching on skype as well as
the pretend reporters in my classroom
and I just saw that in this 10 year olds
eyes
the world his world was bearing down on
him he stepped up strong and said are
there any questions the shouts from the
reporters came from all around the room
and he raised his hand and pointed to
one of the other students she quickly
asked well what are you famous exploring
for and when did you explore and he
stopped and thought he answered
well I&#39;m famous for circumnavigating the
globe in 1972 some of the kids started
to laugh and II look confused and lost
time and dates were not his strength I
saw the pain on his face but to Andy&#39;s
credit he stood there with courage
continued to answer the rest of the
questions before he stepped down my
heart broke during our next after-school
chats I asked Andy where did you find
the information I googled it of course
right as a teacher my soul was pained
though to see this effort that I was
making to try to connect him with his
peers totally backfire simply because I
assumed too much to be transparent that
moment still haunts me to this day I
know in my failure I failed him and I
pushed him further away from his
classmates well I may have given my
students a checklist that included seven
tests of reliability such as are the as
the information found on multiple
sources correct and accurate I didn&#39;t
teach them what they needed I didn&#39;t
teach them to have the ability to judge
well especially in this current era of
false information and fake news those of
us who are parents are answer uncle&#39;s or
maybe you work with children or no
children or work with adults you know
that just because we teach something
doesn&#39;t mean that the person actually
knows how and when to apply that skill
did you know the fake term or the the
term fake news has been around for a
long time according to some sources
it&#39;s been around as long as 4,500 years
they&#39;re actually ancient Egyptian
hieroglyphics to talk about this very
subject historians also recognize that
this exact phrase was used in ancient
China Persia in an early anglo-saxon
culture more shocking of course is that
the actions taken to combat fake news in
these early civilizations where
sometimes cruel everything from exile to
torture to death when you take a deeper
look you realize that this is a problem
that&#39;s led to the downfall of cultures
small and large what&#39;s even worse is
that the history that I just shared with
you about the term fake news was all
fake I made it up
you now may be entering a mindset of a
skeptic nearly of skeptics izing nearly
everything that comes out of my mouth
but this is a strategy I actually use
with my students I want to keep them on
their toes I want to keep them
questioning I want to keep them thinking
like so many of the educators I know I
wanted knowledge and truth to be what my
class was ultimately striving for not
for grades or marks not to be skeptics
not to fear things I wanted them to
question I wanted them to think it
sounds simple but in this time of the
internet and artificial intelligence
taking over the task of remembering and
answering questions for us it&#39;s almost
becoming revolutionary so just how big
is the problem my students and others
who are facing that are doing research
online I&#39;m not sure I could answer that
but I can see that the words fake news
is been in a rapid increase and during
that same time a word like discernment a
powerful word meaning to have the
ability to judge well has been on a
steep downward slide a strong example of
this happened in the US and the 2016 US
presidential election you know the one
right yeah so researchers at Stanford
University in Silicon Valley showed that
over 35 million social media shares
occurred around unsubstantiated news
stories fake news is trending towards a
critical and viral mass right now let&#39;s
break it down and examine just one of
the infamous fake news stories then you
this presidential candidate and a highly
respected global religious leader was
shared and according to MSNBC on social
media over eight hundred and sixty eight
thousand times reports are that
sixty-two percent of people right now
say they get their news from social
media this is a problem all this came on
the heels of the largest social media
platform removing all human element from
identifying fake news and turning it
over to an algorithm to solve that
growing problem
I can tell you with confidence that one
hunt percent of my students didn&#39;t
contribute to those numbers and I&#39;m
pretty confident most children either
right so what did I do and what can we
do to deal with the explosion of false
information and fake news like many of
the things that I do in my classroom I
approached fake news in a completely
opposite direction rather than the
traditional research instruction method
we were going to play with the concept
of real and fake so I created a game
combining a play to learn model with
seven tests of reliability that we
became a powerful learning experience
for my students before we played I
wanted to test my class with some fakin
true news so using stories I found on a
news satire site like the onion or mixed
with reliable sources mixed with
reliable sources such as newsela I
tested their ability and they had a
tough time identifying the difference
between fake and Trina&#39;s our next step
was to have the students actually play
with the concept of finding or creating
fake or true news stories themselves as
you can imagine 10 year olds found and
creates some of the most interesting
articles
Shuki he found a story titled tourists
from New Zealand dies taking an
alligator selfie it was a hit with the
class and we discovered that it was
actually fake Riya she twisted a true
story into a fake one called the ten
most endangered dog breeds but she just
threw in the ten most common top freeze
Anderson in my class he got so good at
creating fake news that he also started
editing photos to match that content to
trick everyone this all helped us to see
how easy it was to fool someone and
create something especially when you&#39;re
not thinking carefully we kept going
with our learning though and we
connected with classrooms over Skype and
we challenged each other to test our
ability at identifying faking
the kids loved playing this so we kept
playing I began I began to see them
apply this to other content areas they
would raise their hand and call me over
to say hey mr. medley look at this it&#39;s
a fake news story and they were able to
explain it to me
still better when I questioned them why
did they know this was true or fake they
were able to tell me why it was true so
there I was checking my email feeling
very proud that my 33 students through
play not practice sheets or quizzes or
tests were able to become skilled fact
checkers and identify errs of true news
and hopeful that I had created something
that could be shared out there in the
world to help other students as well not
face what Andy had faced when I got an
email you see after the story of our
class&#39;s effort to combat fake news
started to spread on National Public
Radio and the United States as well as
other news media sources we began
receiving inquiries from across the u.s.
and actually around the world this email
was from another media outlet who wanted
to share our journey with their audience
but after agreeing I found something odd
their news outlet wanted to share our
story their way I was told in an email
by the director how my class would run
our game when their camera crews came in
so they could get the right shots for
their story I started to laugh thinking
of the irony of being told by the media
to fake how we do things in my classroom
so that they could tell the story about
how my students spot fake news I shared
the email with my class and decided to
let them choose would we be recorded and
change what we&#39;re doing or should we
stand strong just a side note kids
really like being on TV
my student Gabe said it best though mr.
Bedley wait what are they serious I
could see him thinking he said is
anything in the newsreel is anything on
the internet true as a teacher at that
moment you&#39;re really proud of the
ability of your 10 and 11 year old
students to have thoughts so critically
about something that&#39;s such a young age
there&#39;s got to be something true out
there Adam interjected into the
conversation he grabs his computer he
starts searching for things that are
true and the other kids follow it along
after they got it they made it there
were now discern errs of information
rather than unconscious consumers Adam
figured it out
our approach needed to shift from being
focused on what is fake to what is true
in my class students no longer accept
facts at face value nor does the class
in Kansas that we play with regularly
nor did the other class is starting to
play this game these students are
becoming leaders in the movement to seek
out truth like them we all need to
become truth seekers and not just
dismissive and cynical and skeptic
imagine children from around the world
rather than being restricted from the
internet becoming a vital element to
help make this powerful tool better for
us all identifiers of real and true
before their biases are too deep my next
step I&#39;m launching a site for my
students called fact check us or factor
us where my students at Eastwood
elementary school can show their
truth-seeking skills to the adults
around the world it&#39;s a place where
people will be able to go and have my
students and other students fact-check
for them before they post another fake
news story on their social media
accounts again discernment is defined as
the ability to judge well it also
implies that we&#39;re taking action it&#39;s a
word not commonly used where I
wisdom yes knowledge of course smart and
intelligent are frequently used but the
word discernment seems to be missing
from our vocabulary and at the same time
it seems that we may have lost the
ability to judge well so let&#39;s commit
today to find discernment so the next
time you&#39;re in a classroom sitting with
a child or out enjoying a meal with
friends at a cafe or maybe the next time
you&#39;re scrolling through your social
media let&#39;s just ask one simple question
how do I know this story is true let&#39;s
listen to the video content with a
discerning ear before using the power of
a single click let&#39;s read beyond the
clickbait headlines with a discerning
eye and judge the information carefully
and let&#39;s be seekers of the truth
regardless of what we find now you know
my mission as a teacher and I&#39;m asking
you to join me on this mission let&#39;s all
become truth seekers jockey
