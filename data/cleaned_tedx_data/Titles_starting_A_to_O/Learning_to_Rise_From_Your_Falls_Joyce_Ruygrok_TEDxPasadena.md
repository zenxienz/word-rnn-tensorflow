on July 23rd of this year I celebrated
the 4th anniversary of my 21st birthday
+5 or as my grandson insists it&#39;s the
50th anniversary of my 39th birthday
however you sliced up it&#39;s 89 now I I&#39;m
a Swedish descent and whenever the
Swedes sing happy birthday to you at the
end they always say uske feelin roar
which means you should live to be a
hundred well I tell you there were many
many times during my life I did not want
to live to be a hundred but I&#39;m here
today starting my 90th year telling you
I am exactly where I want to be my life
is exciting my life is rewarding and you
know in order for things like that to
happen you have to take adventures so I
thought if someone who had lived 89
years shared their adventures with you
you might perhaps be inclined to take
that journey too because believe me it&#39;s
worth it so I&#39;m here today I&#39;m here to
challenge you I&#39;m here to challenge you
to embrace your Falls because only then
can you experience that really
empowering word rise I had my first
major fall when I was about 50 I was
going through a divorce I have three
daughters two of them were still at home
didn&#39;t have much money I didn&#39;t have a
degree I didn&#39;t know what I was going to
do with my life so for the first time I
sat down and I talked to myself I
answered myself and most importantly
tried to be honest you know sometimes
it&#39;s hard for women to be honest I hate
to admit that you men do some things
better than we do but but you are more
honest with yourselves and we are Who am
I
where do I want to live what kind of
people do I want to surround me and
support me how do I give back to my
community and I also learned I need lots
of Pat&#39;s on the back and I need to feel
I make a difference in helping people to
be the best that they can be so with a
friend of mine and 15 extra pounds I
found out what a nutritionist does and I
thought to myself ah here&#39;s where I
belong I can do this I can do a good job
at this because not only will I meet my
needs to help people to be the best that
they can be but it will also make me
accountable for my own vanity my career
went on for quite a while but there&#39;s
something I&#39;d like you to think about
when you think about yourself you know
when you buy a new car it&#39;s a big deal
right and it comes with a manual and the
manual says put premium gas in it so you
put premium gas in it it says bring it
in every five ten thousand miles for a
lube and an oil job you bring it in for
a little bit of oil job if you want it
to look nice like it does when it&#39;s new
you not only have it washed and clean
but you detail it from time to time and
here we stand with the most magnificent
piece of machinery that was ever
invented have you read your owner&#39;s
manual
[Music]
do you know what you came with you know
what you had to work with to be the best
that you can be
I had my next fall see it was about five
years ago and I was at a leadership
training meeting and it was in a Nora
Torre and pretty much the size of this
maybe it was a little bit larger and I
was coming down to come to my seat which
was sort of in the front and you&#39;ll
notice up in the back there they have
some railings that you know will lead
you down to a certain spot and of course
you know your children become your
parents after a while you know hold on
to the railing mother look where you&#39;re
going
what&#39;s up so you know I had my hand on
the railing but I was coming down and as
usual you noticed my hands are never
behind my back I&#39;m always talking and I
put my foot down to go into what I
thought was the aisle well it turns out
to the the aisle ended where I was going
to put my foot down so I took this
tremendous fall and I knew I&#39;d done
something wrong because it really hurt
and here I had about 500 women everybody
looking down and of course they had to
call 9-1-1 and four women I tell you
it&#39;s just a lightful I don&#39;t know how
they gets a chance of firemen but it
really helps when you&#39;re hurting and you
look up at these experiences and they
decided that they had to take me out and
because it was a small place they
couldn&#39;t get a gurney in so they brought
in one of those boards you know you&#39;re
watching all the football nowadays and
you see lots of times when they can&#39;t
take the player out on a gurney they
strap him to a board they lift him up
the whole stadium goes crazy applauds
and puts his fingers up I&#39;m going to be
fine well I took that trip
and I believe me my heart goes out to
these young men because it really hurts
you&#39;re putting on a good show
they got me to the hospital and now I&#39;m
84 years old
much fractured my femur so they decide
we have to operate so in comes this
lovely young nurse with a pair of
scissors I swear they looked that long
and she said I&#39;m here to cut your pants
off and I looked at her and I said over
my dead body you don&#39;t understand I have
a Tahari suit on
[Applause]
so I said to her okay I&#39;ll make a deal
with you I&#39;m going to count to three I&#39;m
gonna hold on to the side of the bed and
when I say three you could pull my pants
off and she said I can&#39;t do that I said
oh yes you can
so I said one two three
she pulled and I screamed and these are
those pants
I also went back to work about three and
a half weeks later but I had one leg
that was an inch and a half shorter than
the other and I&#39;m a shoe freak
I had like 60 pair of shoes in my closet
and I thought what am I gonna do so I
was lucky here comes my vanity again I
found a gentleman who could fix my shoes
so that when you looked at him you
didn&#39;t realize that one shoe was much
taller than the other little vanities
good thing then I guess it was about
March or April of this year I was at a
friend&#39;s house and talked about what we
were going to do for a certain program
and I forgot because that does happen
when you reach my age at her kitchen
went one set down into the family room
so I&#39;m talking about and then I water
and down I went in this whole side of my
face hit the hardwood floor and believe
me that word is right hard wood so then
I got a hematoma on the right side of my
head about the size of a tennis ball and
it was draining all down my face and is
funny I only drained down one side and
it stopped right here so I got to
thinking okay what are you gonna do I
maybe 89 years old but I&#39;m very busy I
have a very busy life so I thought to
myself well what are you gonna do are
you going to kind of you know hibernate
for a month or whatever and that&#39;s when
I thought oh how about scarves and I can
wear the color that matches my face
every day my final thought to you I&#39;m
gonna read it&#39;s something that I shared
with a friend of mine who maybe 10 12
years ago and she reminded me of it so
I&#39;m gonna read it because I wanted to
come out exactly right there is never
any need to be hard on yourself or to
think you should have it all figured out
you always know as much as you are meant
to know at any given moment and growing
into your fullness is a process that
unfolds with divine timing you and your
life are beautiful works in progress
enjoy the discovery of who you are and
embrace your life&#39;s lessons your
instruction manual will naturally create
itself I truly believe that and I hope
you walk away feeling the same way
don&#39;t fret the Falls folks and
especially young people don&#39;t be afraid
of those Falls don&#39;t let them get you
down use them to teach you to rise
[Applause]
