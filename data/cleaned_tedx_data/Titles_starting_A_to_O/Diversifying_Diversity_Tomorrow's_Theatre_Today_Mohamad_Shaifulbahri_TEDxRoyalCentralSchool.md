the year is 2015 it&#39;s the tenth year
since I have started yellow chair
productions a community theater group in
Singapore to celebrate our 10th
anniversary my team and I have planned
an exciting season of work that we had
announced well it was exciting to have
hit this milestone I started pondering
the big why why are we telling the
stories were choosing to tell we decided
to cancel that season and spent the
celebratory reflecting instead inside I
started to question if I was doing
theater for the sake of my vanity or if
it were for a higher cause so to speak
now June 2016 we&#39;re knee-deep in
rehearsals for Bumi our debut production
at the Edinburgh Fringe and for our new
company in bloom collective I&#39;m also
working on our business plan for the
company for my visa application now
booming the show is a Singapore UK
collaboration there were eight
Singaporean and three British artists
involved and as we explored the notions
of culture identity and home we started
to realize that it wasn&#39;t just one
person&#39;s story of finding one&#39;s self in
a foreign place anymore we discovered
that we were more alike than different
that even those who were born here in
the UK was struggling with issues
surrounding culture and identity the
issues with being redhead or being born
with dual heritage for example and hit
me what is the legacy that we&#39;re living
behind for the next generation of
theatre makers what is the story that I
am going to tell and that was when my
practice evolved now working on that
business plan the initial idea for the
company was to be one that would be
making trash transnational work purely
between Singapore and the UK now with
the earlier question in mind we realized
that there was so
much more than we could be doing as a
company and decided that we will open
our doors to people from all around the
world
imagine a space where artists of
different nationalities can come
together to find what connects them a
space where different genres forms and
mediums can experiment with each other a
space where one can be who they want to
be groundbreaking hardly new I&#39;m sure
there are collectives and other informal
groups are they&#39;re already doing it but
if this this the new norm well the more
those of us doing it talked about it the
more it will be now meanwhile around the
world the rhetoric about difference was
growing louder and louder individuals
and communities being singled out as the
other you will never belong here get out
as people started thinking about
building walls to keep others out I
started thinking about how our bodies
are becoming blurred today and how
theater can keep them down now prior to
making work in the UK I had never heard
of the term be am ii or beam black asian
minority ethnic when I got here I was
immediately categorized as an Asian
theatre maker back in Singapore we have
issues with the cm I Oh Chinese Malay
Indian and others a simplistic
categorization of the primary races in
Singapore that was created on a national
level and we have issues surrounding
representation in our mainstream media
but those are stories for another day
but in Singapore in in English in
English language theater our cast and
production and creative teams are
generally diverse as are the stories
that we choose to tell well most times
that we don&#39;t go about thinking about
race as much but being an Asian theatre
maker in the UK was a little more
complex as a predominantly Malay and
Southeast Asian person I didn&#39;t really
feel represented I found several theatre
companies making work about South Asian
and East Asian communities but there
were very few work and
stories off and about Saudis Asia I
looked around there were several theater
companies making work about black
communities and other ethnic communities
and in the last 20 to 30 years these
companies have fought hard to get the
voices of their respective communities
heard and its people seen and they&#39;ve
done an extraordinary body of work to
get things to where they are today
now there is a need for this to continue
but I also thought what&#39;s next
where are the stories there are more
reflective of what we see on the streets
today that&#39;s a great diversity in a lot
of the communities we live in different
nationalities backgrounds cultures
colors living side-by-side with each
other and communicating with each other
on a daily basis a community theatre
applied theater theater and education
have taken great strides in making work
that&#39;s more reflective of the state of
things today but where are these stories
on our bigger stages in works made by
major companies look I am cool with
Shakespeare and our modern classics as
much as a next person but how many
Hamlet&#39;s do we need to keep seeing on
the West End
every few months now earlier this year
our company worked with the Bunker
Theatre in London Bridge on a project
called bunker without bodies one of the
pieces we presented was a dance piece
led by my fellow joint artistic director
Sol Terry I&#39;m in for it who wanted to
work with two other international
dancers yet gotten to know they wanted
to explore how their respective dance
forms from traditional cultural dance to
hip-hop could work together but as they
were exploring the piece they started to
realize that above all there were three
Muslim artists from Singapore Jordan and
Kyrgyzstan who had all converged in the
UK and soon the story started shaping
itself
did the Southeast Asian Central Asian
and Middle Eastern Muslim artists have a
similar experience of life in the UK or
was it markedly different for each of
them just because it&#39;s always being
doesn&#39;t mean it should be how do we
change things when those who have gotten
there before us are refusing to change
there needs to be a continued culture of
change at the top that can say enough
with box-ticking
enough with KP i fulfilling programs
enough with saying i don&#39;t know where
the diverse playwrights directors and
actors are diversity needs to be
celebrated all the time and not just as
a token istic part as one of one&#39;s
programming now I discovered something
exciting while I was in Edinburgh for
the Fringe recently I am of Malay
descent as I mentioned earlier and what
I know about my family is that on my
dad&#39;s side my grandfather&#39;s family has
its roots in Java in Indonesia and my
grandmother&#39;s dead of Malacca in
Malaysia I&#39;m also aware that a lot of
many people spread over the die spread
not just limited to Southeast Asia so at
the fringe we met with a dance company
from East Taiwan and they&#39;re made up of
the Army&#39;s people which is an indigenous
tribe found in Harlan County and it was
amazing to learn that we had a
connection between our two communities
we discovered that we had similarities
in our spoken languages and then someone
from New Zealand tells us that the
language of the Maori people also had
its similarities with the Malay language
now some of you might think I&#39;m an utter
new before not already knowing this so I
sought Google&#39;s help and I discovered in
addition to what I had already known
about our links to Malaysia Indonesia
and the other parts of Southeast Asia we
could trace our genealogy to the
Polynesian Micronesian and Turkic
lineage as well as Formosan which are
the Taiwanese Aborigines now there are
schools of thought that disagree with
the above findings but what we can&#39;t
deny is that we are all linked
culturally linguistically and
genetically and what I&#39;m talking about
here is merely the tip of the iceberg
now while this obviously got me
extremely excited to want to pursue
finding out more about my personal
lineage and history the producer
me is going this sounds like a brilliant
opportunity to tear down some borders
the thought of male artists working
alongside Taiwanese and Maori artists
and finding that shared history common
languages and stories amongst them gave
me goosebumps now some of the projects
that our company have tried to support
the development of in the past year
include a Chinese polish collaboration
exploring the impact of technology on
distance based relationships between
mothers and daughters an exploration of
sensuality and violence against the
backdrop of military regime in Colombia
in some something that&#39;s not always
faithfully captured in TV shows and
movies about the country Bangladeshi men
trapped in a remote hotel in the
Scottish Highlands encounters a Scottish
girl on a hen night out against the
backdrop of modern slavery based on a
true story now there are myriad of
stories yet to be told out there that
requires telling and there is a demand
for them which is why representation is
important and if we don&#39;t tell these
stories there won&#39;t be an audience for
them if we tell them they will come now
it&#39;s amazing to learn from East Asian
friends who get children coming up to
them after their shows surprised to see
a fellow East Asian face in the cast
now this harks back to the Edinburgh
Fringe last year we&#39;re at a roundtable
discussion about racial diversity at the
Fringe the comedian Desiree birch said
you can&#39;t be who you can&#39;t see with
regards to representation and that has
stuck with me since so how do we ensure
the longevity of such in the theatre
making of tomorrow you ask now one of
the ways is to create an ecosystem or
find one that you can be a part of now
in Singapore we&#39;ve been looking at some
of the newer companies that have come up
in the last five years and that is sort
of informal network going we&#39;ve all got
our different niche we&#39;re all trying to
carve our own little corner of the
industry
trying to support the work of emerging
artists and we&#39;re all looking ahead at
the parts that we&#39;ll be playing in the
next 10 to 20 years now one earlier this
year one of the companies did an open
call for new scripts and they received
about 30 submissions all from aspiring
playwrights in their late teens to the
mid 20s the company eventually selected
three to five pieces that would fulfill
their programming for the next three
years but what happens to the 20 or
other scripts then this is where the
ecosystem proves useful the company can
introduce the playwrights to other
companies that might be more suitable
for their work you&#39;re a more
experimental theater company here are
three playwrights were more more of an
abstract feel to their work they&#39;re a
device theater company here farik&#39;s were
interested in the devising process we&#39;re
not just looking out for each other as
companies we&#39;re looking out for the
artists too it saves them the time taken
to prepare five to seven introductions
to those companies and instead they see
that they are connected the companies
artists and later venues and audiences
they&#39;re all part of this great big
interconnected web and over time it
won&#39;t just be scripts skill sets and
opportunities that we will be sharing
with each other if our philosophies
values and attitudes towards diversity
is a common one then the language we
speak as art makers will start to ring
louder and louder and it&#39;s only a matter
of time before it becomes the language
of the next generation that it is the
norm
sometimes we if we keep the doors to our
house shut to the world outside will
always be looking at what&#39;s already
inside will always revert to what we
already know respond to what we only
know and retreat from what we will never
know in the midst of all that reflecting
in 2015 I found myself in London
pursuing my masters in the very holes of
this
I opened my door took a step outside
close my eyes and took a long and deep
breath and when I opened them I realized
that from that point onwards I&#39;ll always
be looking out never just in from that
point onwards everything made sense
because reflection it&#39;s easy to react
and respond anyone can do it brexit
let&#39;s make a show about blacks Trump
let&#39;s make a show about Trump but what
aspects of those events should we focus
on do we jump on the bandwagon of brexit
and Trump a scene or to receive the
stories that require telling stories
about families that could potentially be
torn apart communities that are
oppressed stories about how politics has
trumped common sense the way for us to
ensure what we make today resonates and
remains relevant tomorrow is reflection
someone builds a wall up the art we make
at a thousand tiny hammers chipping away
at it someone tries to pull and tear us
apart the art we make are the thousand
needles and threats that stitch them
closer together as an artistic community
we need to come together and plant the
seeds for our industry&#39;s future let the
child who comes into the theatre
discover that the magic of theatre isn&#39;t
just in its ability to widen one&#39;s
imagination but the magic is also in the
child&#39;s ability to see one&#39;s self
community and people represented on
stage representation methods we all
mathaa thank you
you
