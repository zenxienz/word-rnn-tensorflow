the definition of innovation that I&#39;m
using today is that it is innovation
happens when an idea comes out of your
head or an invention comes out of the
lab and it impacts society people use it
and people may pay for it and here&#39;s a
more formal definition let me give you
an example of innovation an example not
from the United States or from Islamabad
but an example from a remote area of
Pakistan in this case Quetta illegal a
recent graduate in Quetta four years ago
illegals elder brother suffered a
debilitating mining injury throwing the
family into turmoil he resolved right
there to do something to improve the
safety of minors in Pakistan he got his
opportunity a couple of years later in
his final year project and he developed
a smart helmet which you see here this
smart helmet monitors body temperature
pulse rate it also detects poisonous
gases and oxygen content in the air plus
it tracks location illegal has already
sold 20 units and is already making an
impact innovations throughout the ages
have actually changed the rhythm of
history they&#39;ve actually changed the
course of history back in 1775 Asia
accounted for 80 percent of the global
economy we had the Ottomans in Turkey
and the Mediterranean we have the
Safavids in Persia we have the Mughals
here in India we have the Ming and Qing
dynasties in China yet within a century
Asia was in shambles can anybody
recognize who this is wow that&#39;s a lot
of people very impressive
that is water shells of the British
colonialists held a kangaroo trial
exiled him to Burma where he died
thus bringing a once-proud dynasty to an
ignominy ascend his mane
what was his main crime he missed the
first industrial wave he missed the
Train
literally missed the train on the first
industrial wave which was driven by the
steam engine and the vest went on to
innovate and to surge in prosperity so
innovation is something which if you
catch you can create a lot of wealth but
if you miss the boat you can be set back
by centuries so the first idea that I&#39;m
presenting is that innovation drives
prosperity but also disruption and what
you see is that if you look at the last
2000 years
for the first 1800 years the global GNP
was relatively negligible in the last
200 years as you can see it has surged
to over 50 trillion dollars so that is
innovation which happened in a rearview
mirror what is the next innovations
which are coming the World Economic
Forum describes the next wave of
innovation as a fourth Industrial the
first three waves were driven by the
steam engine by electricity and by
information technology respectively so
steam engines by collapsing the distance
between trading countries increased
prosperity electricity of course lit up
the night increase productivity a
hundred times for humans the fourth
Industrial wave is distinct from the
from the information technology wave in
that it combines cyber or digital
technology with physical as well as
biological technologies so we now have
technologies like artificial
intelligence like robotics like virtual
reality and so on how can we bring this
innovation to Pakistan how can we
benefit from the fourth Industrial wave
so that we don&#39;t miss out on innovation
like we&#39;ve done over the last three
hundred years when it comes down to is
asking how can we be not just consumers
or retailers or assemblers of these
technologies but rather help design them
so
our workers are not domestic workers or
drivers were making twenty thousand or
fifteen thousand rupees a month they
work on these technology and they&#39;re
making hundred fifty thousand rupees a
month in Pakistan over the last several
decades we&#39;ve been asking this question
we&#39;ve been asking how can we link
academia with industry they&#39;ve been
asking how can we spur innovation
organizations have been made policies
have been developed but around the world
what we see is that R&amp;D institutions or
academia or corporations do further the
bound of human knowledge they do
research they do file patents
occasionally they might produce
commercially viable innovations even
individuals or common citizens might
produce what are called regards or hacks
for example mineral water bottles used
to produce lighting or vase produced
used to produce energy
but the primary organization structure
all over the world in the last few
decades which has innovated is the
startup now startups are long-term
focused businesses they combine
experimentation risk-taking technology
development market knowledge and most
important a gel execution innovation and
scaling is in their DNA they are
distinct from small businesses which may
replicate existing business models like
a restaurant or a salon so for example
your local nova neighborhood restaurant
is a small business but a global chain
of restaurants is a start-up or was the
starter startups often failed but they
that failure can be a big learning
lesson so businesses can fail startups
can fail but people don&#39;t fail as long
as you learn from that startup you
become even more valuable now we see
that startups have proliferated around
the world startups which over staff also
discussed earlier which equals unicorns
of billion dollar startups and you
mentioned some startups around the world
which are owned by Pakistani VC we
haven&#39;t seen such startups yet within
Pakistan itself but we have seen them
around the world
we still have a long way to go and what
we see actually in what we see around
the world is that startups or companies
which were once startups have now become
the most valuable corporations in the
world they have made their way up to the
top so the next idea I did number three
is that startups are the building blocks
of the knowledge economy and over the
last 10 years they&#39;ve displaced
ExxonMobil&#39;s of the world and the
general electric&#39;s of the world and all
the top startups are now tech startups
alphabet which is the parent of Google
Apple Facebook Amazon Microsoft now in
the last generation if you think about
it and you&#39;ve probably seen it if you&#39;re
old enough many jobs have been automated
and have been lost so for example ice
carriers they used to be I scariest 1/7
replaced by fridges refrigerators we had
tonga drivers who are replaced by taxi
drivers we have Roby&#39;s who are replaced
by washing machines the 4th Industrial
wave is causing a similar disruption it
is changing the future of work
after years of promise robots have come
out of the labs and they are penetrating
industry agriculture and services so for
example in neighboring India one textile
manufacturer Raymond recently replaced
10,000 workers with robots now if you do
that if there&#39;s a threat of mass
unemployment but if you do not do that
your productivity and your
competitiveness plummet so a question
really is not whether or not we should
use robots but should we become how can
we become the producers of robot so once
again our workers are making hundred
fifty thousand rupees a month but other
than 20,000 fees among what robots have
done to blue-collar work or physical
labor
artificial intelligence is doing the
white collar worker since the last about
20 years artificial intelligence
programs such as IBM Watson have beaten
human Grand Champions in chess
in goal and in jeopardy young lawyers in
the USA are finding it tough to find a
job because artificial intelligence
based programs do legal research much
better in Pakistan there are hospitals
that are looking at air based diagnostic
systems to detect diseases such as
cancer because these systems detect
cancer far better than any doctor so
given these strengths what does it mean
to you five years ten years down the
line what skills are going to be demand
how can you prepare for these skills
well some of these are going to be
around these areas which are searching
such as artificial intelligence there&#39;s
going to be a demand for people who
teach these artificial intelligence
machines there&#39;s going to be a need for
people who explain artificial
intelligence decisions so for example if
a particular algorithm automatically
selects students for a college admission
task or selects people who qualify for
particular insurance program somebody
needs to explain somebody needs to
explain why I did that because there are
compliance issues similarly there are
ethics issues so there&#39;s a requirement
around there there&#39;s going to be a
requirement for lot of data scientist
there&#39;s going to be a requirement for
cyber security specialists but
underlying all these technical skills of
what we call soft skills and somebody
once or somebody recently called them
power skills because they empower you
what are these
first of all creativity so about a
decade ago an organization which I was
then heading contracted Tony Murphy who
was a vice president in Gorton group and
he did a study of the IT industry and
the education system in Pakistan one of
his memorable quotes we cannot afford to
just learn we have to learn to learn why
is that the pace of change is so quick
that by the time you graduate you&#39;re
doing much the majority 60% 80% of what
you&#39;ve learned is going to be obsolete
the average job today last two years
there are than 40 years so what all of
us all of you are going to have to do is
come into new situations which have not
happened before and have the critical
thinking to ask the right questions and
to figure out how to go forward
human interaction another thing which
does not easily lend itself to
automation now routine human interaction
is going to be automated right here in
Samba a local telco is outsourcing the
whole customer service department and
replacing them with artificial
intelligence based BOTS but what we call
influential human interaction like
leadership like sales like caretaking
that will always be sought after so the
next idea which I want to present to you
is that the future of work is going to
be very different and we could have
prepared ourselves for it now innovation
doesn&#39;t happen in a vacuum we can&#39;t just
have a bunch of startups many of them in
this room who start innovating by
themselves startups operate in an
ecosystem they need this oxygen what
comprises that ecosystem you need
funding you need most of all a
responsive workforce which is trained in
the skills that attitudes that you
require some of the things we&#39;ve been
talking about you need a large domestic
market of early adopters people who are
risk takers who will try out new
products and you require the legal
structures then centers to support these
startups non-partisan we have seen that
a large domestic market is in fact
evolving we have be having and with the
broadband expansion and with smartphones
we have a lot of connected customers who
are potential innovators and early
adopters however there are many pieces
that are missing so the government
needs to play a role in plugging these
holes now that idea might seem simple
and intuitive to you the reality is that
many people think otherwise they think
that because startups are all about
innovation and innovation is so alien to
government culture that the government
best stay away in fact I remember once
in a visit to India to Bangalore one
gentleman said and the other seemed to
agree with him that the reason that
Bangalore is the silicon value of India
is that it is so far from New Delhi and
people say similar things about Silicon
Valley and Washington DC which is even
further well the reality is very
different the reality is that in the
weather of the United States it&#39;s India
China Israel
UK Australia country after country their
governments have awarded
development contracts funding
intellectual property and incentives to
startups they&#39;ve built into betas for
startups and they&#39;ve invested in their
workforce so idea number fibers that the
state has a role to play in building the
innovation ecosystem now given all these
five ideas how do we move ahead how do
we implement how do we ignite this new
thinking how do we build these
structures and develop this workforce
and ignite innovation well it so happens
I like Mina mentioned I work for a
company called ignite it&#39;s the national
technology it&#39;s a national technology
fund it is owned by the government of
Pakistan it is funded by telecom
operators like Telenor and PTCL and so
on and we are working on many of these
pieces so we are looking at helping
create a future where we have smart
cities where there&#39;s low congestion
there green spaces there are community
centers such as this where diverse
people can come together and debate
ideas and be inspired and inspire each
other using driverless vehicles
on-demand driverless vehicles using
clean tech
using sustainable developer where we
have home AI based systems
health systems which monitor and analyze
and diagnose your health issues thereby
being proactive improving your health
and plummeting costs we want to use ed
tech or education technology blended
learning synchronized learning there are
several about seven or eight successful
projects around the country right now we
want to expand them so we can bring the
22 million out-of-school children into
the education lab and inculcate in them
what we call steam science technology
education art and mathematics so
critical thinking technology as well as
creativity we want to create a workforce
using these this attack which is well
versed in the skills we talked about the
power skills as well as the technical
skills and finally what we want to do is
that leveraging this broadband
leveraging this these international
marketplaces and the proliferation of
computing devices of all types we want
to take employment opportunity and
entrepreneurial opportunities right to
people&#39;s doorsteps in rural areas in
urban areas so they don&#39;t have to flock
to cities that is the future that we
want to ignite thank you
