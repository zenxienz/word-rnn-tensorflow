hi so my name is Enrico and when I
turned 44 years old
I had a little bit of a meltdown I
realized my lifestyle was very toxic I
had a terrible accident I crushed my
number4 I was told by the doctors that I
was never gonna be able to run and
certainly if I walked I would have
walked with a limp it was a little bit
of a tragic moment and I got quite
scared I knew that things were working
out and one of the points I&#39;d like to
make today is that inside of us we know
when things are not right
we might mask it up but we know what&#39;s
going on and I being a little bit
radical in the way I do things I decided
there was pointless to go halfway so I
decided to change my life entirely and
find a new direction in 2001 I had
started a company that made garments
with recycled jersey in the state of
Alabama we used old stitching techniques
from the Appalachian Mountains to make
quilts everybody thought it was mad but
the business actually worked but most
importantly it opened my awareness which
is very important to sustainability I
realized that you could have a business
you could do good you could contribute
you could create a community and you
could live off it
so in 2007 June 29th I left New York I
left everything I built and did I saw my
companies I saw my businesses I&#39;m sorry
same thing I sold my home and I left for
Europe I started studying everything I
could to see how it could better my life
how to be sustainable and I took courses
in yoga became a Chanel certified yoga
instructor
I started meditation
learned all about health I studied about
cell transplant and stem cells I went to
India I went to China I even did white
magic I tried everything I possibly
could to become self-sustaining I
learned how to cook how to saw I even
tried to make candles and soap I mean I
tried it really all and at the end of
the game what I found that was very
interesting to me having worked in real
estate and finance before was that 40%
of all carbon emissions come from
buildings that was shocking to me I also
found out another statistic which really
impressed me which is that 43% of all
the food we produce goes to waste having
had a background in real estate in
finance I felt that maybe this was going
to be my calling I had to do something
that was related to sustainability to
health and to the home and so that
direction I had to take it was pretty
obvious was to try to make environments
or to study and bring the message that
the home can be a healthy environment
one can actually improve the quality of
your life we spend 90% of our time
indoors we spend 35% of that in bed that
is a staggering 260,000 hours spent in
bed so the bedroom is really very
important to us it affects the way we
perform I mean sleep is an incredibly
important function in our body
it&#39;s very repair Ettore and I&#39;ll get to
it later but the number one thing which
I really understood out of all these
different philosophies was that we do
have one master book to look at to learn
things and that is nature if you look at
nature and you understand that nature is
a closed-loop cycle where nothing goes
to waste where the mechanism uses you
and you use a mechanism it&#39;s a symbiotic
way of life and that&#39;s the way we should
learn how to live another very important
thing was that cleansiness is lecture
godliness in other words if you want to
change your life around if you want to
do something new you have to really
clean out for
so you have to get the clutter out of
your hat out of your house out of your
head so that you can think clearly there
are a few things that you can do at home
and I had a little bit of a bucket list
but I want to bore you with it so I&#39;m
just gonna go through it quite fast
for instance the mattress mattresses are
mostly made with synthetic fibers which
means that every time that you rest on
it the air seeps through it and you
inhale that air in that hair is somewhat
toxic well multiply that by 260,000
hours and it tells you more or less what
a mattress could do to you into your
state of health there are now options on
the market which are affordable which
are made of natural fibers like cotton
or wool and next time you consider
buying a mattress I would really like
you to think about that not to mention
the fact that all these mattresses end
up in landfill and so let me give you
one staggering number five point nine
million mattresses were discarded in
2014 in the UK alone so if you think
that you&#39;re discarding a petroleum-based
product it&#39;s gonna last forever it&#39;s
going to take thousands of years to
disintegrate but a product that instead
is made with an organic compound will
take 500 times less so that&#39;s something
to think about I think the same thing
goes with your pillow and your sheets I
mean we&#39;re not designed to handle
microfibers which come from the wear and
tear of our products at home especially
not man-made microfibers those are very
bad for your lungs and they do have a
cumulative effect lights
it might seem stupid but with the advent
of the new regulations for LEDs we&#39;re
all flooded with them I mean there are a
lot of fun now you can buy strips and
you can buy light bulbs that are super
cool you put them under your bed you can
change the lights with your app on your
phone you have 8 million different
combinations of lights that you can have
it&#39;s incredible however one thing that
people don&#39;t talk about is that whether
it is a tablet or a laptop or a light it
also emits blue lights in that frequency
interferes with your endocrine illogical
system it actually lowers the production
of melatonin so I would recommend to you
in your bedroom after you&#39;ve changed
your mattress in your sheets is to also
have an incandescent light to use a
night with a dimmer that will really
help with your sleep electromagnetic
waves and frequencies that&#39;s a big one I
mean we all have an intuition and as I
said to you before we are you know part
of this universe and part of a mechanism
and I think that we we know how things
when things are right or wrong well now
try to picture a baby sitting on top of
a router
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll cringe no reason to
really apparently but there is one
reason you know intuitively that that&#39;s
not healthy so the Wi-Fi and all
electromagnetic frequencies in your
bedroom really do affect you now there
is a very quick way to solve that is you
can buy an extension cord with a switch
in multiple plugs and you plug all of
your electronics in it and at night when
you go to sleep you just switch that
thing off and there you are you have
some peace and quiet when we are in bed
we use a laptop a lot at least I do and
I&#39;m quite serious about this one please
make sure that you don&#39;t use your laptop
directly here in your genital or your
stomach area very bad for you especially
if you one day would like to build a
family it does have an influence on a
biological and cellular level on you and
there have been studies that have proven
it it&#39;s very dangerous
there are lab desks which are lined with
a fabric impregnated with colloidal
silver and that will prevent the EMF
from reaching you and they also have
something called belly blankets and you
can buy for instance on Amazon air
that&#39;s a big one air prana that&#39;s the
source of all energy and you
your grandmother or your mother might
have told you to open the windows in to
freshen up it&#39;s true you should do that
unfortunately outdoor air in big cities
can be more toxic than indoor air so you
can always consult the web to see what&#39;s
going on but keeping the air in your
room clean is really essential for
sleeping and I&#39;ll come to it at the end
when I talk about toxicity you can buy a
filter you can get an HG FBA rated
filter machine sometimes they go on sale
they can be relatively inexpensive but I
think it&#39;s an incredible investment as
is for instance when you repaint your
room using a novio C paint some paints
now on the market are made even entirely
with organic compounds those are
practical things that you can do but
above and beyond those I think it&#39;s a
state of mind when I studied
sustainability I realized that the
biggest stumbling block is not so much
the product or the action it is a state
of mind you have to change your
perception of what sustainability is and
as you make all these little changes in
your bedroom it will automatically
instill like a seed inside of you and
open the door to sustainability will
increase that awareness and that&#39;s
really what you want to do going back to
toxicity I like to say that our body is
a perfect system and we during your
sleeping is when it really cleans up and
performs all this repertory functions
now if the body has to choose between
cleaning out and repairing it will first
clean out which is also an interesting
process to think about so if your body
is toxic and if your body is toxic in
bed and if your body is toxic in bed and
has to perform its functions during
sleep it will first of all clean itself
out then it will repair so I think it&#39;s
very important to make sure that the
bedroom is like an inner sanctum it&#39;s
like
it&#39;s like your protective layer from the
world I mean there are wi-fi&#39;s now
everywhere that I&#39;m terrible I&#39;m
terrified about Wi-Fi and I think that
when you go into somebody&#39;s apartment or
in a building you turn on your phone and
you check what signals you get you get
the signals of 20 of them well all that
stuff is energy all that stuff goes into
you it can go through walls well so why
should it be able to go through your
head I mean it&#39;s highly unhealthy the
bedroom and the home is changing
dramatically I mean the way we perceive
things is changing technology is making
these big changes but I think that to me
in the future the better will become
more and more a sheltering place to the
extent that everything will change but
really the enemy outside is no longer
gonna come to you with a clave to Club
you in the head and drag you away from
the hair I think the enemy of the future
is gonna be those minuscule particles
that come in through the windows are
coming through the ducts who come
through the food and through everything
that you do which are polluted the new
luxury is gonna be cleansiness and I
know all of this is crazy I mean I
changed my life around and I have to
tell you at 54 I feel great at the
beginning I thought it was mad but I
think you have to believe in madness and
the way to believe in your madness is to
really listen to your inner voice thank
you very much
[Applause]
